1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
4815
after the bill to reduce internal taxes, and for
other purposes, shall havebeen disposedof"—
the Journal says, " two thirds of the Senators
presen t voting therefor.'' There is no question
in the mind of the Chair that the bill to redu-ee
taxation has been disposed of. When a mat-
ter passes from the consideration of the Senate
it is disposed of; and the Chair will illustrate
in this way: the bill has been postponed to
a day certain ; if it had been postponed to the
14th day of July, the day before this session of
Congress ends, no Senator would hold that the
naturalization bill should go over until after
that bill was taken up on the 14th of July and
finally passed. If the order had been that the
naturalization bill should be postponed until
the bill to reduce taxation was passed, then
the point of the Senator from California would
be good; but it has been disposed of by the
Senate by removing it from the consideration
of the Senate. It is true it is only for two days,
but the argument holds just as good as if it had
been three weeks.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. What is the
question before the Senate?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The naval appro-
priation bill is pending, but the Senator from
Indiana moves an executive session.
Mr. MORTON. At the suggestion of the
Senator from Maine I withdraw that motion,
with the understanding that 1 shall renew it at
half past three o'clock, he thinking he can get
his bill through by that time.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I want to finish
the naval appropriation bill, and I hope that
then there will be time for the Senator to have
his executive session.
Mr. MORTON. I do not consent to post-
pone the motion longer than half past three
o'clock.
.Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. If the Senator
wants me to make that agreement, I cannot do
it. I would rather the sense of the Senate
should be taken on it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If no Senator
should be on the floor at half past three, the
Senator from Indiana can renew the motion,
which is privileged.
Mr. MORTON. I withdraw my motion, with
the understanding that I shall renew it at half
past three o'clock.
PRINTING OF AN AMENDMENT.
Mr. HARLAN submitted an amendment
intended to be proposed to the bill (II. R. No.
1227) to authorize the construction of a bridge
across the Missouri river; which was ordered
to be printed.
TAX SALES IN INSURRECTIONARY STATE?.
Mr. JOHNSTON submitted the following
resolution:
Resolved, Tliat the President of the United States
is requested to cause to be communicated to i ho Sen-
ate a statementof ait moneys paid into the Treasury
on account of all property seized and sold i'or taxes
due to the United States, under and by virtue of an
act of Congress of June 7, 18G2, entitled "An act to
collect taxes in insurrectionary districts, and for
other purposes," including also a statementof the
title of each case, the name of tho owner of the
property sold, the purchaser of tho same at tho tax
sale, and the names of the officers by whom respect-
ively the proceeds of sale in each ease may have been
paid into tho Treasury, and the amount actually paid
in in each and every case.
Mr. POMEROY. It will require an im-
mense amount of clerical force to get all these
facts. I think the resolution had better be
over.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being-
made to its consideration, the resolution will
he over.
NMVAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
bill (il. ii. No. 1533) making appropriations
for the naval service for the year ending June
::0, 1871, the pending question being on the
amendment reported by Mr. Drake from the
Committee on Naval Affairs in regard to the
pay of officers of the Navy.
Mr. DRAKE. Before tho question is taken
on the amend ment, I desire, under instructions
from the Committee on Naval Affairs, to make
two modifications of it: first, on page 9, line
one hundred and twenty-nine, after "pro-
fessors of mathematics" to insert ''and civil
engineers ;" and then on page 10, line one hun-
dred and sixty-two, strikeout "six" and insert
"seven."
The VICE PRESIDENT. Those modifica-
tions will be made.
The amendment, as modified, is to insert the
following as an additional section :
Sec. . And be it further enacted, That from and

Mr. DUAKE. In reference to this section,
which embraces an entirely revised pay-table
for the Navy, I desire to say a very few words)
in explanation, that the Senate may see exactly
what has been done in reference to this subject
by the Committee on Naval Affairs.
We have had this matter before us for several
weeks. We have endeavored to study the
whole subject with all the light that could be
brought to bear upon it, and with all the inform-
ation that we could gain ; we have endeavored
to put the pay-table of the Navy upon some-
thing like a fair and rational basis,"and the result
in this section, which is now before the Senale,
is this; a reduction of almost every rate of
pay, resulting in an aggregate saving proba-
bly to the Government annually of about one
hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars; mid
yet a pay-table which, so far as I can learn,
gives next to universal satisfaction to all the
officers, line and staff, of the Navy. With this
brief statement 1 leave the question to the con -
sideration of the Senate.
Mr. DAVIS. It was my purpose to propose
a modification of the amendment of the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs; but I beg to make a
few remarks in connection with the pay of some
of the lower officers of the Navy.
In conversation with a lieutenant, he ex-
pressed his opinion, in which I concur, that
the reduction of the pay of the subordinate
officers of the Navy is too great. 1 will give
one or two examples. I will take a mate first.
A mate at sea, as the pay now exists, receives
$900, on shore duty he receives $800, on leave
or waiting orders he receives $G40. These are
the present rates of pay. The same officer, by
the proposed rates, at, sea would receive $900 ;
on shore doty, $700; and on leave or wailing
orders, $500.
I believe that these rates of pay are not
sufficient for the decent support of a mate,
especially when he is on shore. The Senate
will observe that the pay when on leave or
waiting orders is $500. I ask the honorable
Senator, and I ask the Senate if that sum
is sufficient for the decent support of a young
man of this position? Suppose he is wait-
ing orders in this city, or is on leave in this
city, what can lie get his board and lodging
for? He cannot obtain decent board and
lodging for less than $480 a year. He would
have to pay at the rate of forty dollars a month
for anything like comfortable and decent hoard
and lodging. What would his clothes cost him
per year? Every person knows that a young
man attached to the Navy and filling that place,
cannot clothe himself with any decency for
less than $"250 a year. What will his washing
cost him? No young man can have his wash-
ing done in this city or anywhere else, in any
town or city of the United States for less than
