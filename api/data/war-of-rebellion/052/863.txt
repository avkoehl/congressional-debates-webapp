Major-General HALLECK:

The following has just been received:

CUMBERLAND GAP, September 25, 1863.

W. C. LEMERT,

Colonel, Commanding.

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, September 25, 1863-4 p.m. [Received 8 p.m.]

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The latest heard here from General Burnside was on the 21st at Morristown. Nothing in regard to movements or of importance in his dispatch.

I have ordered two regiments at Glasgow, Ky., to at once proceed to Nashville. They leave Glasgow at 5 this p.m. I deem this absolutely necessary, as General Rosecrans telegraphed he had been obliged to draw all the troops he had at Nashville to the front.

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, September 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

General Burnside expects General Manson to join him at Knoxville marching via Jacksborough. The general will be expecting him and will communicate with him. Please have General M. push forward as rapidly as possible.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant- General.
HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, September 25, 1863.

Captain W. P. ANDERSON,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The Fiftieth Ohio and Ninety-first Indiana ordered to Nashville according to order and as requested by General Rosecrans. They will have transportation at 5 o'clock p.m. General Manson will move at noon to-day with Twenty-seventh Kentucky, Eleventh Kentucky, Thirty-fourth Kentucky, and detachments of 500 men for East Tennessee. Does the general desire them to go directly to Knoxville? I am uneasy for General Burnside.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
