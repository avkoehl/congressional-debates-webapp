The Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad was relinquished as a military road and turned over to the company September 15, 1865.

THE NASHVILLE AND DECATUR RAILROAD

Extends from Nashville to the Memphis and Charleston Railroad at a point near Decatur, Ala., and is 120 miles long. The repairs were completed and that road opened in March, 1864. Much of the work in opening it the first time was done by soldiers,and I have no account of the cost of what they did. General Dodge was in command of the force employed on this work. The following statements show the amount of work done and the cost of that done by the Military Railroad Department.
