CONGRESSIONAL  GLOBE   AND   APPENDIX
FOR   THE  EXTRA   SESSION 
This sheet completes the Congressional ©lobe for the Extra Session. It contains an index to
all the proceedings, and a statement of all the appropriations made during the session.
The .Appendix to the Congressional Globe, which contains all the long speeches made during the
session, and written out by the members themselves, we expect to complete within four weeks of this
time, at farthest.
We will supply subscribers for either of the works, without charge, with any numbers which they
may not have received, or have received and lost or mislaid, if they will inform us, within one month
from this time, free of postage, of the numbers, or pages, they need to complete their files.
We have on hand complete copies of the Congressional Globe and the Appendix for the Extra
Session, which we will dispose of for Si each—that is, SI for the Congressional Globe, and Si for the
Appendix—to any person who may apply for them before the first day of November next, when we
intend to send them to the Northern cities, to be disposed of there.
The Congressional Globe and Appendix will be published by us during the next session of Con-
gress, which is expected to continue seven months, for Si each. We contemplate publishing the
Senate proceedings more fully, even, than they were published during the Extra Session. Those who
intend to subscribe for these works, should have the money here by the sixth day of December next,
to ensure all the numbers.
No attention will be paid to any order, unless the money accompanies it; for we cannot afford to
open accounts with subscribers, at the prices which we charge for these papers.
BLAIR & RIVES,
Washington City, 4th October, 1841.
