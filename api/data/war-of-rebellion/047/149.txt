I know that good motives could only have actuated General Ripley in issuing such an order. His activity and untiring zeal are familiar to al in his military district. Doubtless he did not intend to disregard the general orders alluded to above; but the fact of his having done so, whether willingly or not, is very palpable, however, and was calculated to delay, instead of advancing, the completion of the works he was so anxious to have in operation.

In conclusion, I would suggest that Captain L. Cheves be reinstated in the direction of the works on Morris Island; that proper steps be taken to insure prompt transportation of all material required by the engineer department, and that the details of men on the bridges and causeways from James to Morris Island be increased to at least double the number actually employed on said work.
