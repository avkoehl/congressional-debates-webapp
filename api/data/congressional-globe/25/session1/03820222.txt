democracy, ?nd then a little federalism, until we
are served up in the end with a ragout of both,
but so artfully compounded and seasoned that the
original ingredients are no linger to be discovered
This leads me to say a word or two as to the ori-
gin of this piebald part} It took us rise more
from individual interests and p"nate views—from
partialities and antipathies, thin fiom any other
cause.
The old parties into which the country bad been
so lone; divided had ceased to have any piacticil
existence under the admimstrat on of Mi Monroe
All t'ie great measures of federal policy had been
adopted by their opponents The navy, a Bank
of the Umred States, mte'nal impiovc nents, the
S}Stf~¡ of I ght-houses and barbois—r'l had be-
come favorite measures with ti e dominant party,
and theie remained little to struggle about but ab-
stract dectrines of construction which had m t suf-
ficient mtsiest with the multitide to sustain the
zeal of paity narfire Notwithstanding this,
the fedem st., ¿, a both, wete pn scr bed, and
the demagogues of the day were di-posed to keep
alive the ancient anunosny, that the favois ot
Government misht be confined to a smaller
number of persons, very wisely considering
that, as the days of miracles had gone by, and
the loaves and fishes could not be made to teed the
■whole multitude, it was better to limit the numbet
of mouths to he led In this state of things, Gen
Jackson's pretensions to the Frcsidenc} Here
biought forward , and as he had proposed, in his
ce ebrated letter t> Mi Monioe, to dcst.oy the
monUei, pari} spmt—'oi it seems'here were mon-
sters in those days as well as ,.t prseent—and had
leeomi ended to that gentleman to act as the
Piesidctitol the nation, and notas the Piesiilent
of apart} , and to make his appointments indif-
ferent!} Iiom tne good men of both patties he en-
listed at once the sympithitsol the Aderahsts m
his fivci They limed thioiuh his means, to
ob'itriate the an< icnt paitv names and distinctions,
and come in for totu share of tlit honots an 1
emo'uments of the Government Besides, many
of them li It a peculiar repugnance to his opponent,
Ml. Adams, irom the fao* oí his having b 't then
party, and it was believed that it he should even
ttesire to act libei illy towards them, the peculi irit}
of h s pi sidoti is a eonieit would not suifei him
to do so It uas thus tint Geieial Jackson uas

prop )*es the sub Treasmy sc\eme, which is to restore
us to the h?lycon davs of our prosper t}, and
which, in my opinion, will open the door to more
fiaud, corruption, and national loss, than any Oiher
that could be devised, and will, in its turn, be
abandoned for some other novelty, if the People of
this country do not m the mean time see fit to dis-
m ss these expel ímenters from the r service
There have been some minor incidents in this
di ama, thrown in to heighten the effect, such as
the quarrel with the Vice President, the dissolution
of the Unit Cabinet, the difficu'ty wnh South Ca-
rolina, the contest with the Senate, and the lupture
with France The gieat principle of the party has
been blind obedience, and the discipline of the
camp was introduced into the cabinet In-
deed, so passive has been that obedience, that the
party may lay clum to the encom um which the

I come now, sir, to consider my last proposition
m relation to the measure now before the Senate,
which is, that this Sub-Tieasury scheme is less s^fe
an 1 less convenient and moie liable to abuse than
the agency of the State banks Upon this point I have
the authority of the Secretary of theTreasuiy, in a
repoit of his, made dining the session of 1835-6,
and also the authouty ot the Seiator ftom South Ca-
lolma, (Mr Calhoun,) who does not appear, m the
year 1834, to have been as much enamored of the
scheme of individual fiscal agents ?nd specie pay-
mt nts to the Government as he does at present In
his speech, delivered hereon the 21st March, 1834,
upon Mi. Webster's motion for leave to bring in
a bill to continue the charter of the Bank of the
United States, he expresses himself explicitly the
p iint which he is urging is the necessity of re tor-
mg the equdibuum between the spCLie and the
paper which compo ed the currenc}, and the ques-
tion is a*, to the means of doing so After reject-
ing the taxmgpow eras odious and unconstitutional,
and stating that the mere coining pow er would have
but a limited control over the currency, he sug-
gests that someother must be used, and then states
thit the most immediate and obvious is, the exclu-
sion of eveiy thing but specie in the receipts of
the Government He then proceeds to express
himself as follows
" But there is, m my opinion, a strong, if not an
insuperable, objection against resw ting to this mea-
sure, lesultmg from the fact that an exclusive r e
ceipt of specie in tne Tieasury would to give it
eflicacy, and to pievent extensive speculation and
fidud,'requue an entire disconnection on the part
of the Government with the banking system, in
all its forms, and a resort to the strong box, as the
means of preserving and guarding it- funds—a
mans, if practicable at all in the piesent state of
things, hable to the objection of being far less safe,
econom cal, and efficient than the piesent "
Such, sir, were the opinions of that Senator in
the year 1834, when he seems to have considered
a disconnection between the Goverment and the
banks as an evil to be dreaded, not a measure tobe
appioved, and a result to the strong box as being
hable to the objection of being far less safe, eco lo-
rn ( a!, and efficient than the present
[Mr. Caihoun here desned to know whether the
Sen -'or from Delaware read that extract from his
speech for the purpose of convicting him of incon-
sistencies in his opinions and course of conduct on
tins subject, for he wished to observe that he could
not admit that his opinions were to be gathered
from one extract from a single speech, when he had
delivered several others, which, if all taken together
would show that his opinions weie unchanged in
relation to the piopnety of disconnecting the Go
vernment from the banks ]
Mr. B4YARD replied that it was no part of his
purpose to convict the Senator fi om South Caro-
lina of inconsistency in his opinions, that to do
so would not assist his argument, nor be agreea-
ble to the private feelings which he entertained to-
wards that Senator, that if theie was any apparent
inconsistency, he legretted it, but that he cited him
as authority upon the particular point now under
consideration, namely, the comparative safety of
the public treasure in the two modes of keeping it.
Mr Bayard then proceeded The President of
the United States, m treating this part of the sub-
ject, does not present the matter fairly , he speaks
of the amount of the public funds likely to be on
hand at any one time, as presenting an average of
not moie than thirty thousand dollars in the hands
of any one orficei But, sir, it is t ot a question of
aveiage. The receipts of many individual officers
will be ten, twenty times that sum, in a very short
space of time , and the amount in their hands may
accumulate, by delays in payment  or transfers,
greatly beyond that sum, or twenty times that sum.
The President fuither treats this question of safety
as if it were one which depended on the relative
strength of the vaults that w ere to be employed for
the safe keeping of the public treasure, whereas
the real question is es to the confidence leposed in
the officer, and his official fidelity. Ko one fears
open depredation on either. But no reasonable
man will pretend to say that there is any compari-
son between the safety of ai ds entrusted to a sin-
gle individual, checked only by his sense of duty,
and the penalty of his official bond, and the safety
of the same funds deposHed in the vaults of a bank
under the check of daily supervision and accounta-
bility on the part of it* offieeis, and secured by its
entire means, the greatei part of which could not
be the subject of depredation or fraudulent abstrac-
tion. But, sir, I am not disposed to be satisfied
with any vague conjectures on this subject, or
flimsy reasoning about probabilities. I appeal to
experience as the only true guide, I call in us
light, and I ask what are the lessons which we
derive from it i Let me for a moment draw the
attention of the Senate to the case of the Receiver
at Fort Wayne, in Indiana, reported to the last
session of Congress, as furnishing an illustration of
the manner m which money may accumulate in
the hands, of a public officer by a slight neglect of
his instructions, and the kuid of reasons which
may be given for not complying strictly with them.
It appeals, then, that this officer, instead of a
sum of $30,000, which the President supposes is
the average amount which would be in the hands
of any officer at any one time, had accumulated m
his hand, between the 7th of March and the first
of June, the sum of jj601,380, and that he made
no deposites, as m duty bound, from the 7th of
March to the 15th of June. That both he and
his relative had been m the habit in the ofhee of
shaving money, in other words, exchanging money
which could not be received for public lands, at
a rate of discount varying from three to five per
cent and that he was in the habit of taking in five
dollar notes, contrary to his ordeis, for doing which
he received a premium All this is clearly establish-
ed by the document to which I refer Under these
cncnmstances, we find a late Senator cf the United
States writing to the Secretary of the Treasury m
relation to this officer, in the following strain That
he is reputed to be an honest and honorab'e man,
and that the Senator did not think he had inten-
tionally done wrong. And then proceeds to ex-
press himself as follows- " It would to some ex-
tent produce excite iient if he were removed, for
he has many warm and influential friends, both at
Foit Wayne and in Dearborn county, from which
he removed to his present residence. Better let
tt be "
At a subsequent period we find this officer assign-
ing to the Secretary as a reason for not going to
deposite funds in his hands, that his democratic
fnends thought he ought not to leave the place
