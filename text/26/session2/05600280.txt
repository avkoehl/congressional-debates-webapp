APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

26th Cong......2nd Sess.
Treasu y Note Bill—Mr. Br< ckenridge.
H. of Reps.
gress in the performance of the da íes oonfid d o
it, and for which this body is respor isle If,
hereafter, the country ihould be injured by bad le-
gislation, let the blame rest where it ought to rest,
on the people themselves and on their Jtepresenta-
ttves The people will thus be thrown upon their
own energies, and they will call their Representa-
tives to a more strict account What measuies
may be adop ed by the new Congress it is not for
this Congress to discuss; neither can it be known
to the Pres dent elect until after it sha 1 have as-
sembled. We must endeavor to unle. rn the bad
habit we have acquired under the two last Admi-
nistrations, of looking uptnthe President ot the
United Slates and^the heads of departments as the
Government, and as the arbiter  of die fate ot the
country. We must learn once more to look up 10
our Representative  and at the ¡.ame time to de-
pend upon ourselves. It the next Congress, re
presenting the wishes of the people as it does and
as this does not, shall determine to touch the tariff,
and at once modify it, so as to secure a sufficient
revenue, it will do si if it shall determine to
charter a National Bank, or distribute the public
lands, it will do so We are but agents here,
not assembled to consult oar petty mtere11 of pai ty,
but to obey the will of those who sent us and to
adopt such measures as will promote the general
welfare We come here to carry int > effect the
will of the people, and not that of the Pi evident and
his Cabinet; and I have no doubt we sh II htar the
same thing from General H.urison himself The
tampering with the duties exclasivt 'y belong
mg to Congress was thp great tin oí the late Ad-
ministration, which had gradually acquired an as
cendancy over it, entirely incompatible with the
spirit and letter of the Constitution
But the great point gained by the late election is,
in my opinion, the establishment of what has been
caled the one tjtrm principle This was ct mmg
upjat once to the line of true Democracy Is then
any one on tbis floor who will now opemy dtc'aie
himself against n? On this subject, at lpa t, i>
must be admitted that public opinion has declared
itself. General Jackson was elected on this princi-
ple. I appeal to the records of Tamm<my Hall *
He disregarded it, and it has recently been declared
on the highest authority, that he and his kitchen
cabinet were desirous of a thud term, but the party
could not be brought to it. One of the mottoes oí
the Van Buren party was, "the Constitution ¿s it
is," and there is nothing there to limit the number
of terms to two or three During the late contest,
this one-term principle took the lead of all other
topics of discussion The people t.cre convinced
that their free institutions have been endangered by
the re-eligibility ot the Chief Magistrate, and by
the political intrigues and corruptions attending the
struggle for re-election They believed that the
first term was regarded as the stepping-stone to the
second, that the time of the President, and that of
his subordinates, instead of being devofd to the
duties of their stations, would be occupied by plans
and political arrangements and exertions to secure
that re election, and at the same time to establish
the succession, and preserve the offices to those
who occupied them Our past history may furnish
some exceptions I believe that oí Mr Adams
was an exception, but the future presented a dreary
prospect.
Doubts have already been expressed of the sm
centy of those who have contended for this prmti
pie at the late election. For myself, I repel the
charge of insincerity, and I will take upon me to
say that those who rea'ly entertain such doubts
know but little of the individual who has been
chosen to fi 1 the office of Chief Magistrate I do
not so much confide m his solemn pledge as m h-s
unsullied public and private integrity But public
opinion has settled the question Hereafter, no
President, without braving that opinion, wiU pre-
sent himself for re-elsction, and the people will re-
* "Experience has satisfied us that one teim of office is «ufh
cient to repay any services, or giatity any ambition Atpn.st.nt
the first four years of an Administration are {as etl in eítbits tí
confirm the bargains and p'edge* as to the right oi buccesMon
It is thus that the great interests of the country are sacnfiml it
the shrine of personal ambition "—Resolution passed at Tarn
many Hall, April, 1828
] qtu'e that t be mdee a part of Use Co is i'ution, as
a recorded as.well as a piaciical amendment
When Washingirn was called to the rffije of
Pjesideit, ne wa* re-ehgible winout limitation It
might have bet-n held for life, at ha t, there was
noih'ng in the Constitution which foioace it Bat
he was not one ot those who loved power for its
ownsaVe, he earae-lly wished to retire after serv-
ing one term, and only yielded to ¡he solicitations
of the friends of the new Government when he was,
fpi the second time, elected by a unanimous vote
Mr Madison and Mr Jtfferson joined in those so-
licitations The example set by him of declining
a third term, has been a law to his ^utcessirs and
effected a practical amendment nn the Democratic
side The people themseives haie njw miuscd in-
ti the Constitutio i afuilhe port on o Democracy,
by dec anng in favot of one tern 'Ihe i nt term
prmcipK in 'he abstract, has receucd the sober
and dispassionate approval of the gr at majority of
the American neopk of all parlies. The first sug-
gestion may be ir«eed to Mr Jefleison, in his lettei
to Mr Adams, written from Paris 11 1787, inwniih
he declaies the want of sucn a ¡mitai o i to be one
of the most serious objections to the rew Constitu-
tion The one-term principle was recommended
by Gen Jackson—to commence in future with his
successors' It would have been as easy foi him to
have set an example of one term a it was lor

ening its duialion in the hands of any on¡ set of

orjanto And here, in my opinion, is the first
eiuse foi rejoicing in the victoiy the people have
achieved at the ballot box over a party which
sought to peipetua'e itself by the veiv mems> placed
n their hands f i the purp ise of administering the
Gov"nmi«nt The odds against «huh they had to
con'end were fearful Again t a hundred thousand
office holders with the vastcirc'e of their influence,
, the disbur ement of the revenue, the press, m the
i pay of the Government—against all this host the
j people had to struggle \m\ the tffort was a
mighty one Th'y rose up peacefully, but in
masses ot from five thousan! to fifiy thousand
They succeeded Power is once more m then own
hands, to be transferred to new apents, executive as
well as legislative, at the end of the next four years,
and 1 hope they will never again lose sight of the
maxim "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty  
Henceforward theie will be no motive "to bring
the publ c office* in confl ct with the freedom of
elections " The Administration will have ample
time and leisure to attend to the business of the
country instead ol reglecting-it, and Confess itself
will feel the effect of this salutary example The
Executive braneh, sir, was fast verifying the pre
dictions of the immortal Patrick Henry—it was
grasping at all power— he sword, the purse, legis-
lation, and even the judiciary was not entirely safe
It had almost succeeded in overturning the freedom
of elections by means of its organized, disciplined
army of office holders spread throughout the coun-
try General Harrison has pledged himself that
heieaf'ei the office holders shall apply themselves
^exclusively to their duties, and abstain from inter-
ference in elections They now know the condi-
tions on which (hey take office, dere will be no tax
upon their salaries to raise an electioneering fund,
no salaries will be augmented, and no new offices
will be created, in ord"r to increase that tax, and
thus, in point of fact, apply the money <f the na-
tion to secure their offices In short, I repea', sir,
tie people haw once more got the power in their
hands, and have become the masters of their own
Government
Mr. Chairman, the wide range which this de-
bate has taken, will be my excuse for giving my
opinions on some subjects wh'ch are but remotely
connected with it I will say something respect-
ing the tariff, which his been so frequently referred
to I represent a district deeply interested in the
subject.   I differ from the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr Wise] as to the obi gaiory nature of
the compromise act If a compact, who were the
parties to if2 What authority had the agents to
make it? Have any rights, individual corporate,
oi State, been vested under that acfi These ques-
tions cannot be answered without taking away the
feundatioa on which it stands. It diners in no re-
spect, legally considered, from an act of ordinary
legnla ion. To say tbat it cannot be touched now,
and that after '42 it becomes perpetual, is to give it
a mgher force tnan the Constitution, which provides
within itself the mode of amendment. The com-
promise act would be as irrevocable as the laws of
the Medes and Persians, and bind the generations
' *et unborn " The expediency of the arrange-
ment at the time to patch up an unfei lunate family
quarrel, and the propnetv of leaving it to run its
ecurve undisturbed, are different questions I am
desirous to leave it untouched until the experiment
be fully tried This must be ¡eft to others, and not
foi us to decide But I an of opinion that, for
the purpose of revenue, without infringing the
compromise act, .. uties may be imposed on silks,
wino, aud some other art cles which pav only a
nominal duty It is not likely, however, that any
thing Can be done at this session it must be left to
the next Congfe>«
If, at the expiration of th  compromise act, two
years hence, the neop°le, through ttheir Representa-
tives, shall requue a revision of he tariff, tor the
purpose of revenue as well as of protection, we
may rely upon it that revision will take place I
consider that the principle cf protection, instead of
being surrendered, has been recognised by that act.
It is, in genera!, impossible to distinguish, praot-
callj,wbatp rlion of the duty on ?ny specific ar-
ticle may be set do n for revenue exclusively, and
what for protection, becau->e a vry small duty
may, m many mslances, in addition to the mere ex-
pens" of importation, act as a piotecnon A fixed
per cent, according to the value, applied to all arti-
cles alike, instead of specific duties, may either
produce too much for revenue or too little. If the
maximum of the fu'l twenty p;r cent be laid on a
numDPr of selected article*1, and others suffered to
come in free, this will act as a bounty on the im-
pc nation of the free article', and this is proved by
ihe ex< essive importations of free articles since the
compromise began to take effect. It is impossible
to foresee the practical effect of disturbing a tariff,
which has for a long period of time regulated our
foreign trade, and to whiGh that trade has adapted
itself Some of the articles admitted duty free do
not come cheaper to the consumer, and, at the "ame
time, the duty is lost to the revenue The duty is
either levied by the foreign power, or is pocketed
by the i nporter, cr divided between them. I am
not, in general, a friend to high duties, because
they encourage evasion I am no advocate of pro-
tective duties at all, which require to be perma-
nently continued merely in aid of the manufac-
turers, and m this I think wy opinion is not dif-
ferent from those who hive been most zealous
for protection It has only been asked for as
temporary aid to infant establishments, to new in
vestments of capital, whose first efforts are feeble,
and easily repressed by the overgrown establish-
ments of Europe When these establishments are
completed, and the necessary ¿kill and instinct of
art attained, the nation is compensated by a cheaper
article, from the effect of competition, and better
than the imported, at the same time that its wealth
and its independence are increased by the acquisi-
tion of a new branch of industry The practica-
bility of accomplishing this object should be taken
into consideraron m imposing duties for protection.
Other nations go much further than we have ever
done, they exclude, by duties, and by prohibition,
art cles which they can never produce to advan-
tage, or produce at all, sue1! as sassafra  and tobac-
co, because they will not encourage the establish-
ment of & class of impoits which may turn the
scale of commerce against them, and which may
be dispensed with In this instance, it is the com-
munity, the general commerce and general pros-
perity, that is protected.
Oui tariff requires revision, in order to ascertain
what articles have completely established them-
selves, and no longer require protection.   Gentle-
