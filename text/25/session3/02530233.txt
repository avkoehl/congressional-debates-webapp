THE COjWRESSIÜNÁL GLOBE.

tion taken on it. With respect, however, to these
Madison papéis, he looked on them m a very
different light from the trash that was so often
published by Congiess Ho had received, this
very evening, ftom a distinguished gentleman in
Vngmia, a letter asking information about them
It was a lettei abounding with good sense, and
placing a proper estimation on these papers
With this lettei in his hand he went round to the
seat of his friend from Missouri, and endeavored
to soften his ngid resolution with iegard to the
distribution of books, so as to make the Madison
papers an exception He endeavored to put these
papers in contrast with the tiash that was put
abioad under the sanction of Congress, which
may, perhaps, foim the matena's for a spmin is
history of the country He represented that
these Madison papers had already been pub
lished, and that there would be an absuidity, af-
ter paying for them, to put them away m the
ganet, with the tiash that lias lumbeied theie
among the cobwebs of time The Senatoi from
Missouri stated the teims on which he would
agite to the distubution of this paiticulai woik,
and that was to make a gcnei il distubution
thioughout the Union, and into e\ery State, and
he desired me to go to the Secietary's tibie, and
get the cleik to make out a list of thegt neral dis-
tribution of documents, and then he would sup-
port it. Mr. R then descanted at length on the
great value of the Madison papers, the import-
ance that the infoi mation contained in them should
be disseminated as widely as possible, and the
absuidity of locking them up fiom the public
view, aftei having paid foi printing them He
did not consider the works of James Madison of
the same natuie with those publications with
which it had been the custom of the two Houses
to supply the members—
" % euitom
More tumor'd m the breach, thin the ob^ervmce ,"
and he hoped that the lesolution of the Senatoi
from Missoun with regard todistubuting books,
would not, like the ngid laws of the Medes ana
Peisians, be applied to them
Mi BEATON said the lefeience of the Sena-
tor fiom Vngmia [Mr Roame] to him was coi-
reet. he liad icfused to agiee to a distubution of
the Madison Papéis to the membeis of Congress,
but was willing to a general distubution, accoid
ing to the geneial distribution of documents, and
desired the Senator from Vngmia to get that list
from one of the clerks, and either omit the mem-
bers of Congiess, 01 ltquue them to pay the cost
This general distribution would i<riy the woik
into e\eiy State—its Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives—its executne office—its colleges and
umveisities—to all the executive offices of the
Geneial Government—to the Libiaiy of Con-
giess—to the ofriits of tht Secretary of the Sen-
ate and Cleik of the House of Rcpiesentatives,
and many otheis It would distubute eleven 01
twelve hundted copies, and place them in eveiy
part of the Union, and in the besthandsfoi pies-
ervation and for us° Gentlemen were debating
as if the only alternatives were between an ex-
clusive andgiatuitous distribution of these papéis
to members of Confess, or a consignment of
them to the woimsin the ganet, and an everlast-
ing loss oí them to mankind This was rathei
wild. The distribution which he proposed would
have saved them fiom the woims, would have
given them to the whole Union, and to all man-
kind, it would have cuitailed nobody but mem
beis of Congiess
The PRESIDENT po tempoje said that on
fuithei consideration, and consulting the rules,
he was of opinion that it did not icqune a quo-
rum to be present to authorize the signing of a
bill or resolution It was not pioperly an act of
legislation, but merely a signing to be done by
the Chair to authenticate the act Holding this
opinion, he would now piocecd to sign the joint |
lesolution
Mr  BENTON said the signing could only be
done in the presence of the Senate, and there was
no Senate when there was no quoium     Etcry
signing was a public act.    The Piesiding Officer i
gave audible notice of it, the Senate ceased to j
act, no Senator could speak, nothing could be
done  while  the President was signing     Mi
B was clearly of opinion that acts could only be s
signed when the Senate was formed and a quo- j
rum present.                                                                 I
The PRESIDENT pro tempore then signed the
lesolution
Mr ALLEN said that the lesolution could
not now go 10 the President for his signature
Theie is no comm'ttee of the House of Repre-
sentatives which is necessaiyto foim the joint
committee, to join the comniittee on the pait of
the Senate to cairy it. 1'he House of Repre-
sentatives had adjourned and dispersed, and the
two members who composed pait of the joint
committee to take bills to the Picsident had
ceased to exist as membeis of Congress The
body to which they belonged had ceased tocxist
The lesolution could not be carried, there was
no authotity existing which could carry it
Mi    FOSTER said  that he would carry it
lie was a member on the pait of the Senate of
the joint committee, i id he had once earned a
bill to the President alone, but he had ascei-
tained that he had made a mistake
[Mi Eostlr and Mr Mlrrick, the commit-
tee on the pait of the Senate then left the Cham-
bei with the joint resolution ]
Mi   BCNTON said the impediments were not
yet suimounted, theie was a little difficulty to be
encounteied when the committee got back     He
had the rules in his hand, and would lead them
at the propei time     It was now foui o'clock on I
the morning of Monday, the 4th of March, the [
House of Representatives adjourned and gone,
and  no quorum here.    There  were  obstacles I
ahead.
Mr   WHITE said  he would state what he |
knew respecting the passage of this lesolution  |
Tie had just come into the Senate Chambei when
he heard the SenUoi occupying the chair [Mr   |'
Williams] ask if a lesolution should be taken up
If he gave it \ny pai ticulai designation ¡tes   iptd   |
my ear    The Piesiding Oihcci put tht question,
ind it was ppsMd, se\ei il voio s voting m the
affnmttnc     Nut knowing what it was, 01 whit
it contained, I as'vtd foi the leading of it, and it
was handed to mc      Vs tin ic was no discussion
on thesul jtct, nodivisionasktd,and none taken,   .
and consequently deeming the question an unim-
portant oik, he voted nutMti live not  no     lie
himself was opposed to the prn tioli  of distub-
utmg books among the m inbeis of Congiess, but
none of those w hose lead he w as accuotonn d lo   í
follow on this subject opptsmg this lesolution,
and  on  looking around ai d  observing that the
Senator from Missouu [Mi  Bemtov] was not in   |
his seat, he thought it was an unimportant mat    j
tei, and did not txpect to hear anything moie
about it.                                                                         I
The committee who waited on the Piesiduit
foi his signatuie to the joint lesoitmon having
amvtd m the Senate C lanibtr,
Mr BENTON lost to a point of 01 del—to have
things done m otdei      One of the most solemn
acts of tht two Houses is th it of sending 1 i'ls to
the Pttsidtnt to bo signed, it has t > be done m i
prcscnbtd furo, and lepnttd and itcoidid in a
piescnbed foim    Upon this depend all tht ques
tions connected with the ten d ij s  const tution il
light of the President toittun  i bul, his ttlpi-
bihty if he dots not lttuin it, the pitie itnn of
theretuin by the adjournment of 0on0r<ss, the
efficacy of the bill is a taw if not letuined in Unit,
unless prevented by ai adjouinntnt     All this
makes tht pjestntation of tht bill to the Pitsident
one of the most forma! and senous acts of legis-
lation, and therefoie the lules had cucfully pi o
vided to make the pitsentationamattei of itcoid
in each House of Congiesi—a lecoid the ventj  j
of which could  not be lmptaelicd, and which I
would require no extt nsive evidtnee to support
it     A standi ig eommutet was to tmy it,  that  I
committee wis to be joint, it was to be composed i
of two members fiom tath House, and thtsttwo
members oí each House weie to m ke leport to
their Houses, respectively, ehat tht bill had been |
presented, carefully seating tht day on which it
was prestnted, and  then   this leport was to be .
entered on the Journals of each House                   i
[Mr   B  htie lead  the rules, to show that he   I
stated them conectly ]                                              Il
He said tht se lules tould not have been com-
plied with in this ease The joint standing com- (
mittee was dissolved by the dissolution of the
House of Repiesentatives The halt committee I
ot the Senate was a nonentity without the otbe! j
half fiom the House of Representatives No |
record could be made in the House of Repie   il
sentatives, which had bee.  adjourned for two
houis, and no such record can be wle here, as
the rules imperatively íequire. I call the atten-
tion of the Secretary of the Senate to the rules,
in tfte entry which he is to make. The Senators
will lepoit what they hate done; and that is, they
went, without the committee of the House, to
the President, and went on the 4th of March,
and there ends the work for which we have been
kept here so many houis It drops now, as I
proposed it should drop three houis ago.
Mr MERRICK reported thatwithm the last
hour the committee had placed in  the hands of
1 the Picsident a joint resolution for the distubu-
[ Hon, in part, of the Madison Papers
I     Mr  TALLMADGE moved that the Senate
I adjourn sine die
Mi   BENTON asked if a minority of the Sen-
! ate could uljourn une die He thought they could
only adjourn from day to day, until a quorum
. was present
The PRESIDENT ¡no tem-poie decided that
the Senate could adjourn «ne die, and
I The Senate adjourned sine die at twenty min-
utes past foui o'clock, a  ni
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Sunday, Match 3, 1839.
The SPE4.KER hid before the House several
Executne communications, which were laid on
tht table, and oidered to be punted
POST OFFICE BUiXDLL\G.
Mi LINCOLN asked the House to take up
the bill to piovide foi the election of a fire-proof
building for the Post Office Depaitment
Mi CIMBRELENG hoped they would con-
fine this day to the nepdtul appropriation bills;
an 1 theittme he must object to it
Mr L1NC0LM then upon moved a suspension
of the ruhs, and tht vote being—ayes 71, noes
as,
Mr  CAMBRELENG withdrewhis objection.
Mr CR-YBB thin objected, but, on a second
tna!, tht vo e oeing—ayes 89, noes 29, no quo-
rum,
Mi CR IBB colled for the yeas and nays, but
th y weit it fused, and tellers being oidered, the
result was announced—ayes 93, noes 35
So the mies we e suspended, and the bill was
put on its thud leading
Mr CRABB was opposed to acting on any-
thing on such a day as this but what was abso-
lutely nocessaiy to carry on the Government.
This was not a measure of that class, and there-
fore hi ojiposed it
Mi TALI VFERRO opposed the bill mainly
on account of the repoit upon which it was based.
Mi CAMBRELEMG demanded the previous
question   which wis seconded
Mr CR VBB moved to lay trie bill on the table;
wl lch was lost
Hie mam question was then oidered, and
theiton
Mi CR IBB demanded the yeas and nays, but
tin y v eie refused, and the bill was ordered to a
third reading, and then lead the thud time and
passed
Mi LINCOLN then submitted a lesolution to
suspend the 16th joint rule, so as to send this bill
to the Senate, which was agited to
FLORIDA WAR.
On motion of Mi C iMBRELENG, the House
took up the amendments of the Senate to the bill
for preventing and suppressing Indian hostilities.
Mr EVERETT moved to non toncui it, the
amendment stoking out the item of f,5,000 for
holding a tieaty with tht Seminóles
Mr ROBERTSON called for the yeas and
nays, but they wtie ittustd
Xht anitiidmtnt then was non-concurred in—
ayes 51, noes not counted.
The other amendment was concurred in
GENERAL   VPPROPRIAriON BILL.
Theamendm in  of the Senate to this bill, upon
which they united, namely, to have the execu-
tne punting n id bi idmg done upon adveitised
tontiact, and the one m lelation to the Document-
al y Ilistmy, were taken up

ion had been mgiafted upon the bill originally,
