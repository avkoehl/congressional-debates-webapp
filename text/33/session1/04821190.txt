, and nays.
■ The SPEAKER. That motion also has been

1 tleman from Illinois, [Mr. Richardson;] and on

tion has been seconded ?
: The SPEAKER. Yes, it can be done after
i seconding the demand for the previous question,
j The Chair decided the other day, when there was
I a contest about the time for submitting a motion
I to adjourn over, that the proper time for making
.! that motion would be when there was pending a
j; motion to adjourn; for the former takes prece-
! dence of it. In the opinion of the Chair, the
J motion to adjourn, and the motion to adjourn
' over, are of such a character that they may be
: put, now that there has been legislative action
i upon this bill.
