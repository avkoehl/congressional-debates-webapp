We were unable to do any damage to the railroad beyond removing a few rails.

We returned to Old Church that evening and night, marching till midnight.

The day previous to our advance on Hanover Court-House we made an extended reconnaissance with a large force and destroyed a bridge over the Pamunkey at Mrs. Hemly's. These fatiguing marches were performed with cheerfulness by the command, though all suffered much from fatigue. Our operations were attended with no casualties except to the Thirteenth New York Volunteers, but were conducted constantly in the face of danger, and with a spirit with showed the willingness of the command to meet it wherever their duty calls them.

Thrown together as my command was for the first time I have special reason to speak of the promptness and energy with which the different commanders obeyed my orders and seconded me in all my endeavors to carry out your instructions. I submit herewith a table called for by your circular, from which it will be seen that in my command none were killed or missing, 7 were wounded, and 173 prisoners, captured by us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel, Commanding.
