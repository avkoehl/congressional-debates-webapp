Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I send the following dispatch, just received. We shall learn more soon:
HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE HEAVY ARTILLERY,May 18, 1864-11.15 a.m.

GENERAL: I am informed by the cavalry that the enemy have thrown out a strong line of skirmishers, infantry, and are advancing with heavy support toward my front.

J. HOWARD KITCHING,

Colonel.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,May 18, 1864-3.45 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My pickets report the enemy concentrating on our left. I suppose this is owing to the movement of our own forces in that direction, which must be plainly visible to them.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,May 18, 1864-4.45 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

General Crawford sends me word that upon investigation he finds no indication of enemy increasing on his left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

FIFTH CORPS,

May 18, 1864-6 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The left of my line of battle is abut 600 yards in advance of the Sixth Corps at the Myers house, and terminates on a line about southwest from that house. We are quite close to the enemy's rifle-pits at this point, and our skirmishers in many places to-day have driven his into his entrenchments. In a line about southwest from the Myers house the rebel lines appear to make an angle off to the southwest toward the Po River, and nothing but his mounted men are to be seen east of that line. In front of the Sixth Corps, too, is a great deal of open country, and if, I am correctly informed by General Crawford and officers of my staff, you can march south and southwest from the Myers house a mile, perhaps, without opposition. I am however, close up to the enemy along my whole front, and in easy musket-range of their main line. I think, if other movements are not against it, the Sixth Corps should advance somewhat, as my left flank stands out uncovered except by some retiring breast-works which I have constructed. I have not troops enough to extend back to the Sixth Corps, and it would not be a good location for them if I had. My line of battle is in advance of where the Sixth Corps picketed yesterday.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
