CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
of the preceding year, and nine or ten millions less
than those of 1837, Nor has it been found neces-
sary, in order to produce this result, to resort to the
power conferred by Congress, of postponing cer-
tain classes of the public works, except by defer-
ring expenditures for a short period upon a limited
portion of them; and which postponement term -
nated some time since, at the moment the Trea-
sury Department, by further receipts from the in-
debted banks, became fully assured of its ability to
meet them without prejudice to the public service
in other respects. Causes are m operation which
will, it is believed, justify a still further reduction,
without injury to any important national interest.
The expenses of sustaining the iroops employed in
Florida have been gradually and greatly reduced,
through the persevering efforts of the War Depart-
ment,and a reasonable hope may beentertpm-d that
the necessity for military operations in that quarter
■will soon cease. The removal of the Indians from
■within our settled borders is nearly completed. The
pension list, one of the heaviest charges upon the
Treasury, is rapidly diminishing by deatb. The
most costly of our public buildings are either
finished, or nearly so, and we may, I think, safely
promise ourselves a continued exemption from bor-
der difficulties.
The available balance in the Treasury on the
first of January next is estimated at one million
and a half of dollars. This sum, with the ex-
pected receipts from all sources during the next
year, will, it is believed, be sufficient to enable the
Government to meet every engagement, and leave
a suitable balance in the Treasury at the end of the
year, if the remedial measures connected with the
customs and the public lands, heretofore recom-
mended, shall be adopted, and the new appiopria-
tions by Congress shall not carry the expenditures
beyond the official estimates.
The new system established by Congress for the
safekeeping of the public money, prescribing the
kind of currency to be received for the pub-
lic revenue, and providing additional guards and
securities against losses, has now been several
months m operation. Although it might be prema-
ture, upon an experience of such limited duration,
to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of
its influences in correcting many evils under which
the Federal Government and the country have hi-
therto suffered, especially those that have grown
out of banking expansions, a depreciated cunency,
and oflicial defalcations, yet it is but right to say
that nothing has occurred in the practical opera-
tion of the system to weaken in the slightest degiee,
but much to strengthen the confident anlicipations
of its friends. The grounds of these have been
heretofore so fully explained, as to require no reca-
pitulation In respect to the facility and conve-
nience it affords m conducting the public service,
and the ability of the Government to discharge
through its agency every du y attendant on the col-
lection, transfer, and disbursement of ihe public
money with promptituda and success, I can say
with confidence that the apprehensions ot those who
ielt it to be their duty to oppose its adoption, have
proved to be unfounded. Oa the contrary, this
branch of the fiscal affairs of the GDvernnient has
been, and it is believed may always b , thus car-
ried on with every desirable facility and wcurity.
A few changes and improvements in the detail  of
the system, without affecting any principles involv-
ed in it, will be submitted to you by th« Stcre ary
of the Treasury, and will, I am sure, receive at
your hands that attention to which they may, on
examination, be found to be entitled.
I have deemed thr  brief summary of our fiscal
affairs necessary to the due performance of a duty
specially enjoined upon me by the Constitution. It
will serve, also, to illustrate more fu'ly the princi-
ples by which I have been guided in reference 10
two contested points in our public policy, which
were earliest m their development, and have been
more important m ¡heir consequences, than any that
have arisen under our complicated and difficult,
yst admirable, system of Government. I allude to
a national debt, and a nat onal bank It was m
these that the political contests by which the coun-
try has been agitated ever since the adontton of the
Constitution, in a great measure, originated; and
there is too much reason to apprehend that the con-
flicting interests and opposing principles thus mar-
shalled, will continue, as h retofore, to piOduue
similar if not aggravated, consequences.
Coming into office the declared enemy cf both,
I have earnestly endeavo ed to prevent a resort to
ei'her.
The consideration that a >?rge publ.c debt affords
an apology, and produces, in some degree, a neces-
sity also, tor resorting to a system and extent of
taxation which is not only oppressive throughout,
bat likewise so apt to lead, in the end, to the com-
mission of that most od ous of all offences against
the principles of Republican government— ne pros-
titution ot political power, conferred for the geneial
benefit, to the aggrandizement of particular classes,
and the gratification of individual cupidity—is
alone sufficient, independently of the weighty ob-
ject ons which have already been urged, to render
its creation and existence the soarces of bi ter and
unappeasable discord. If we ad 1 to this, its inevi-
table tendency to produce ?nd foster extravagant
expenditures of the public money, by which a
necessity is cieated for new loans and new
burdens on tne people, and, finally, if we
refer to the examples of every Government which
has existed, for proof how seldom it is that the
system, when once adopted and implanted m
the policy of a countr>, has failed to expand itself,
until public credit was exnausted, and lbs people
were no longer ab'e to endure its increasing
weight, it seems impossible to resist the conclu-
sion, that no benefits resulting from its career, no
extent of conquest, no accession or wealth to par-
ticular classes, nor any, no' all i s combined ad-
vantages, can counterbalance its ultimate but cei-
tain results—a splendid Government, and an im-
poverished people.
If a National Bank was, as is undeniable, re-
pudiated by the fiamers of the Constitution as
incompatible wit'i the ridits of the StaUs and the
liberties of the people, if, from the lesinmng, it
has been regarded by lar^e portions of our citizens
as coming m dnect collision wuh iha' great and
vital amendment of the Consiitution, which de-
clares that all powers not conferred by that instru-
ment on the General Go> eminent are reserved to
the States and to the people, if it has been viewed
by them as the first great step in the march of lati-
tudmous construction, which, unchecked, would
render ihit sacred instrument of as little value as
an unwritten Constitution, dependent, as it would
alone be, for is meaning, on the m'eiested inter-
pretation of a dominant party, and afloid.ng no se-
curity to the rights of tie riaoruy, if such is unde-
niably the case, what ra loual grounds could have
been conceived for anuapatirg au^nt but ac'ei-
mmed opposition to such an institution at the pro-
sent day.
Coulda different re?u!thavebeen expected, when
the consequences which have flowed from its cre-
ation, and particularly from i s struggles to
perpetuate its exiitenci, had confirmed, in so
sinking a manner, the apprehensions of its earli-
est opponents, when it had been so c early
demonstrated that a concentrated money power,
wieldm? so vast a capital, and combining sucn in-
calculable means of influence, may, m those pe-
culiar conjunctures to which tn.s Gov. rnmeu is
unavoidaoly exposed, pro-te an ovmateh for the
political power of the ptop'e taenr-elves, when the
trte character of its capicity to regmate, according
to its will and its interests, ?nd the interest, of us
favorites, the value and product on oí tre hb r
and propel ty of every man in this extended coun-
try, had been so fully and fearially developed
when it was notonoas that all classes of th s great
community had, by means of the power and influ-
ence it thus p ssesses, fce-n mfec td to madness
wuh a spirit of heedtes specula ion, when it had
been seen that, secure m the support of the combi-
nation of influecces by whieh it was surrounded, it
could vio'ate its charter, and set the laws at defi-
ance with impunity, ard when, too, it had become
most apparent that to believe that such an Eccumu-
lationcf powers can ever be granted without the
certainty of being abused, was to indulge in a faial
delusion?                                            &
To avoid the necessity of a permar.pnt debt, and
its inevitable consequences, I have advocated, and
endeavored to earry into effect, the policy of con-
fimog the appropriations fir the public service
to saiii objects only as a.e c early wi'hm the
constitutional author ty of the Federal Govern-
ment, of exclud'ng from its rxpens's thee impro-
vident and imsutnonzed grants rf public mo^ey
for works of internal mproveme it, which weie
so wisely arrested by the constitutional interpo-
sition of my predecessor, and which, if they bad
not been so checked, would long before this
time hive involved the fi ¡anees of the Ge-
neral Government ¡n embarrassments far sraater
than those which are no ' experienced by any of
the States, of limiting all our expenditures to that
simp'e, unostentatious, an 1 economical administra-
tion of public affaiis, which i* alone consistent
•ftith ihe character of oar ínsfuu ions, of collecting
annually from the cus orns, and the sales of public
land1 , a revenue fully r.deqj<tte to defiay all the ex-
penses thus incurred, but, under no piet nce what-
soever, to impose taxes upon the people to a greater
amount than was actually necessary to the public
serv ce, conduced upon the principles I have stated.
In Leu of a national bank, or a dependence upon
banks cf any description, for the management of
our fiscal affair*, I recommended the adoption of
the system which is now in successful operation.
That system affords every requisite facility for the
transaction of the pecuniary concerns of the Go-
vernment, will, it is eonfiJen'ly anticipated, pio-
duce in other respec's many of the benefits which
have been from time to time expected from the
ereation of a national bank, but which have never
been realized, avoid the manifold evils m-eparable
from such an institution, dimmish, to a greater ex-
tent than could be accomplished by any other mea-
sure of reform, the pa ronage of ihe Fcde-al Go-
vernment—a wise poli"y in all Governments, but
more especial'y so m one like ours, which works
well only in pro ortion as it is made to rely for its
suppoit upon the unb assed and unadulterated opi-
nions of its constituent, do away, forever, all de-
pendence on corporate bodies, either m tne raising,
collecting, safekeeping, or d'sbursmg the public
revenues, and place the Government equally above
the temptation of fostering a dangerous and uncon-
stitutnnsl institution at home, oi the necessity of
adapting its policy to the views a'U interests of a
still more formidable money-po  er abroad.
It is by adopting and carrying out these princi-
ples, under ciaums'ances the most arduous and
discouraging, that the alt nipt has been made, thus
f ?r succes fully, to demonstrate to fie people of the
United Stat s that a National Bank at all times, and
a national debt, except it b¿ ¡ncuired at a period
when ihe honor and safety of the nilion demand
the temporary sacr See of a poli' v, which should
only be abandoned in such e^ig^nc es, are not
merely unnecessary, but m direct and dead'y bos-
tih'y to the principles of their Government, and to
their own pern-anent welfaie.
The progress made m the developement of these
positions, appears m the preceding sketch of the
pan history and pres ntsU e of ,he financial con-
cerns of the F-deral Government The fac's there
stated fully authonz- the assertion, that all the pur-
poses for wh ch tli- Govenmen1 was instituted
have been ace mphshed dun-g four years of great-
er pecuniary embarra rrent than were ever before
I cxper eicei n time of peace, and in the face of op-
position as form J able as a ly that wa ever before
arrv, ed sgoinst the poli y of an Administration,
tha' this has b ea done when the ord nary revenues
of the Government were genera ly decreasing, as

tion of the country, without the creation of a per-
manent public debt, or mcurin g £117 liabiht/, other
than such as the ordinary resources of the Govern-
ment will speedily disc large, and without the
agency of a National B;mk
If this view of the proceedings cf tho Govern-
ment, for the period it embraces, be warranted by
tne facts as hey are known to ex st, if the army
and navy hive been sn«t?m d to the full extent
