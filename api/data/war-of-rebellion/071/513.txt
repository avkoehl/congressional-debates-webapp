Washington, July 30, 1864-2 p. m.

General HALLECK:

We have no communication with Harper's Ferry. The wires are broken beyond Poolesville, and Mosby is reported to be at Adamstown with between 300 and 400 men. He has destroyed the wires and has possession of the railroad there. Your last two dispatches to General Hunter are still here awaiting opportunity to forward them. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. T. ECKERT,

Major, &amp;c.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 30, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff;

SIR: I have the honor to state that I have perfected arrangements for the prompt shipment of 5,000 men from Washington to Monocacy or Frederick. The men will be loaded as rapidly as they can now reach the station. Should you find it desirable to forward any artillery or wagons by the railroad, I find that on two hours' notice we can furnish a large equipment for that purpose.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

J. W. GARRETT.
