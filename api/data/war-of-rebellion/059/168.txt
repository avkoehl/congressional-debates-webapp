(Received 30th.)

Major-General HURLBUT, Memphis:

Re-enforcements by steam-boats left here to-day at 11 o'clock a. m. for Fort Donelson.

General Sherman telegraphs from Huntsville that after you are certain that Forrest cannot cross the Tennessee or Cumberland Rivers you will push rapidly for Savannah and move to Purdy and cut off his retreat, and that General Grierson shall follow Forrest as close as possible all the time.

Colonel S. G. HICKS,

Commanding, &amp; c., Paducah, Ky.:

The enemy is between this place and Mayfield. We are prepared for an attack to-night. I think, however, you have crippled them, and they will not come. Scouts that come in here bring news from them, and I think their loss exceeds your estimate.
