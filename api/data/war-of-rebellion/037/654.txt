SIR: As I informed you in a former dispatch, the enemy advanced in line of battle, from the direction of Brownsville and Livingston, in force; after a sharp skirmish, lasting one hour, they fell back toward Brownsville. We have captured 1 lieutenant and 8 privates from them. I learn they crossed Pearl River night of 14th with five regiments(cavalry and mounted infantry) and two pieces artillery, under command of Jackson the aggregate force amounting to 1, 5000 men. They lost in this skirmish 1 killed; wounded unknown, and the prisoners above mentioned.

Shall I not send a force on Vicksburg road to meet Colonel Chambers?

Brigadier-General.
