Brigadier-General BENHAM,

Commanding Engineer Brigade, &amp;c.:

General Gregg is ordered to post a regiment of cavalry on the telegraph road, about three miles out from Old Court-House, with instructions to the commander to scout daily to and beyond Cocke's Mill, Sycamore Church, and out the stage road, &c. He will put himself in communication with the commander at Old Court-House and give him early notice of any appearance of the enemy in that quarter.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 5, 1864-9 a. m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have nothing new to report from the lines as yet. Three contrabands came in last night from Petersburg and report nothing new.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 5, 1864-1 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

I have directed all Sixth Corps trains, except artillery, to City Point, where I presumed they were. They artillery trains I have directed to go to the plank road, from whence I have ordered up the Ninth Corps train; the Fifth is already up. I have also sent a regiment of cavalry on the Old Court-House road, which, with the one at Prince George Court-House and the one on the plank road, ought to keep guerrillas in order. I shall send you back Mott to-night, but you will have to hold up to Fort Alexander Hays and picket half way from there to Fort Davis.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 5, 1864 (Received 2.50 p. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Do you desire Mott's division to remain at Fort Hays, as General Meade's telegram seems to indicate? If not, I would prefer Mott to relieve the garrison at Fort Davis, which I would use as a reserve between the plank road and the Norfolk road. There are no reserves, to speak of, on the whole line to the river now. Who is to occupy the line between Fort Hays and Fort Howard?

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
