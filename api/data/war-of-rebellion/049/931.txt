[Indorsement.]

This dispatch just received. Shall I send orders for Custer to cross in the morning and pitch in, in case an attack is made? The rebels are evidently preparing to leave in case we succeed. They evidently are not sanguine of the result.

[General SEDGWICK:]

I have neither seen nor heard of anything to induce me to alter the opinion I expressed last night, but I should say that I have made no examination to-day of any importance. I was much fatigued and have remained most of the day in camp. One of my officers thinks the works on the enemy's right have been strengthened, and his view from the point where we were yesterday corresponds with what we see from here.

Major-General STUART,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I have just returned from a reconnaissance into Fairfax. I destroyed 3 wagons and captured 16 horses and equipments and 9 prisoners.

I was accompanied by only 8 men. Captain Smith wasto have followed me with my command on the next day, but a heavy force of cavalry appearing near Middleburg rendere it impracticable.

Respectfully,

JNO. S. MOSBY,

Major &amp;c.
