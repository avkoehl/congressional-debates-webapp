Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

A massage from General Brown to the mayor of this city, received this afternoon, notifies him of the presence of guerrillas, and calls upon him to arm the loyal citizens. I can raise enough men to defend the city, but we have no arms nor ammunition. Can some be sent us? It is the west of the loyal citizens that a body of troops sufficient to keep everything quiet in this vicinity be stationed here.
