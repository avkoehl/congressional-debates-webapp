tnese measures, all anticipited embarrassments du
ring 1838, can prob ibly be obuaied For, m that
event, no provision ot additional means to meet
the expenditures of the year n ill be necessary here-
after, unless before the close of the session it shall
appear that new appropriations have been made,
or are likaly to be made, exceeding the estimates
submitted by the Depaitment in Decembei last, by
several millions, or that the revenues received will
be mateually less
On the contrary, if neither of the measutes
above proposed should meet the appiobation oí
Congress, it is obvious that among the various 
substitutes which may be thought of, or which this
Department has taken occasion to suggest u com-
munications to the Committee of Ways and Means,
some one must be selected, that can be made effi-
cient in its operation, at a very early dd), or it will
be impracticable to pieserve the national faith un-
broken, and to avert the injuries with which the
public service is threatened
With great respect,

asking Congress to grant a portion of the public
domain to that institution, and to others of a simi-
lar character, for the purp >se ot promoting the
cause of education This memorial [sm t Mr B ]
states, and with perfect truth, "that «hile oui
country abounds in collegiate institutions, lew, ll
any, possess those appendages which have render-
ed so illustrious and so perfect the institutions ot
older countries Appropriate libraries, complete
museums of natural science, extensive philoso-
phical apparatus, in slioit, collections illustrative (f
the progress and attainments ot suewc abroad,
and furnishing the most perfect means ol instmc-
tion at home, are yet wanting, and are not likely
to be secured with the present defective means of
ojr colleges "
The memorial was well ca'culated to attract
public att ntion to this important subject He
therefore moved that it should be printed, and re
lerred to the Committee on Public Lands, which
was ordered accordingly

The bill for tho erection of a hospital in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, came up on its third reading
Mr MORRIS opposed the bill chiefly on ion-
stitutional grounds In the course of his remarks,
he took occasion to say that retrocession was what
the people of this District ought abo e all to
advocate He w as aware of the position m which
legislators stood here If they opposed ary mea-
suies of this kind, they are -upposed lo feel un-
friendly to the intercuts of the District He dis-
avowed all such feeling, but «ail he should feel
himself compelled to vote against any appropria-
tion!^ local purposes, or those not immediately
connected with Congress.
Mr ÍÍOANC advoiated the measure with much
?eal and ability as having a tendency to aid the
cause of humanity He leplied to the constitu-
tional objections of Mr Mourns, and asked if
Congress had not the same right to tax the people
to es'ablish a hospital in the l istrict of Columbia,
that it had to establish a United States arsenal at
Old Point Comfort
Mr BUCHANAN felt as kmdlv feeling for the
people of this district as any man, and expiessed a
willingness to serve them on all proper occasions
This, howew, was not a proper time for appro-
priations fot such purposes he had just berta told
that the Treasury was nearly run aground,
and were thev, in the face ol that fact, to borrow
mine) foi the purpose of building a hospital''
Mr B did not know but he would be in favor of
the bill «ei ■• it not for that fact It was from the
same feeling that he was induced to vote against
the appiopiiation lot Michigan, and he was willing
to place the Disti ct of Columbia on the some foot-
ing witli Michigan
Mr 15 !?ai(J, m oidei to test the sense of the Se-
nile m relation lo the matter, he would move to
postpone the bill until the fust Monday in Decem-
bei ne\t, mdonibu question ho should demand
the \eas and nays
Mr NORVELL said he did not rise to reply to
the S"intcr fiom Pennsylvania, or to anything
ci nnccted with the bill, but he leally could not íe-
sist the desire to think him foi the comparison he
had so kindly instituttd between the District of
Columbia and the State of Michigan
Mr BUCHANAN said he hoped the honoiable
Senitoi v as not offended with the remark that Sc-
nttoi would be the last man, and Michigan was the
last State, ol tvhich he would utter any thing disre
<pec ful
Nr NORVELL, (laughingly,) as the gentleman
has made the amende honoiable, m the latin part of
his lemrk I must be satisfied
Mr C4L110UNavowed hanscll a silent listener
ti all the ai^uments offered on this occasion, and
was constamed lo siv that, m no view that he could
take of it, could he permit himself to vote in favor
of the measuie lie thought it both ytrong and in-
expedient He agreed iullv with the vic%vs taken
by the Senator from Ohio, [Mr Monitis,] as to its
beiiu contrary to the spmt of the Constitution, and
besides, h put no faith in the estimate of 30,000
doll rs We ail knew when a public building was
once commenced th it it was nt <i finished under
five times the oni^inal estimate Ml C concluded
by wishmsr that the muter might hi postponed,
and, if brought up, that it would be ultimately
rejeeied

The bill *to cont nue the coiporate existence of
the banks of the District of Columbia was then
taaen up
Mi BENTON avawed himself opposed to the
extension of the charter of these banjjs for twenty
years He admitted something was due to these
institutions, and he had drawn up a proposition
extending tp them time on certain conditions,
which, when they should have been complied with,
would enable them to present themselves wiih a
better grace for an extension of their charters.
They were lo quit at once the shm*plaster work,
toiedeem their five dollar notes after the 4th of
July, and, after a given time, resume m full, and
cease to pay out the notes of non-specte-paymg
banks. In the proposition the Clerk had now read,
he should move to strike out the enacting clause,
and insert as follows
That the charters of the Union Bank, and of the
Faimers and Mechanics' Bank of Georgetown, the
Bank of the Metropolis, Patriotic Bank of Wash-
ington, and Bank of Washington, m the city of
Washington, and the Farmers' Bank of Alexan-
dria, and the Bank of Potomac, in the town of
Alexandt ta, be, and the same are hereby, extended
to the fourth day of March, in the year eighteen
bundled and thirty-nine Provided, The said banks,
t.ach foi itself, shall conform to the following con-
ditions
Fust To cease receiving or paying out all paper
currtney of less denomination than five dollars, on
oi before the day of the promulgation of this act.
Second. To cease paying out the notes of non-
specie paying banks, bankers, or corporations,
on or before the fourth day of July, m the present
year
Third To redeem all their notes of the denomi-
nation of five dollars jn gold or silver, from and
after the fourth day of July, in the present year
Fourth To resume specie payments in full, on
er before the first Monday m December, of the pre-
sent year
Mr ROAND spoke at some length against the
amendment, and m favor of the bill as originally
drafted, and which he was afiaid at ihe time would
have been considered too rigid
Mr HUBBARD thought it would be as well to
repeal the iharters at once as to pass that pro-
viso He did not think that any considerable
portion of the Senate would be found to advocate
such a measure Mr H thought it would be as
well to extend the charters of these banks  during
the pleasure of Congress It then they did not do
their duty to the community, their conduct would
rise in judgment against them, and their charters
could be at once repealed
Mr H submitted the following, which he pro-
posed to offer when in order
That the existing charters of the Bank of
Washington, Bank of the Metropolis, the Patriotic
Bank of Washington, all in the city oi Washing-
ton, and that the charter of the stockholders of the
Farmers and Mechanics' Bank, in the city of
Georgetown, and that the charters of the stockhold-
ers of the Bank of Potomac, and of the stockhold-
ers of the Farmers' Bank of Alexandria, both m
the city of Alexandria, shall be continued m full
force and effect, after the fourth day oí July next,
during the pleasure of Congress, subject to any
modification which may at any time hereafter be
adopte*, or subject to be at any time hereafter re-
pealed by the legislation of Congress Provtded,
That this act shall be of no effect, unless the corpo-
rations therein named shall resume specie pay-
ments for their circulation and other liabilities, on
or before the first day of January next, or simulta-
neously with the banks ot the cities of Baltimore
and Richmond, shou'd those banks resume at an
earlier day.
Mi GRUNDY was in favor of the principles in
the amendment of ihe Senator from Missouri
though he thought it ought to be somewhat modi-
fied being too rigid in the conditions imposed on
the banks Tnesc banks, he said, had all violated
their charters, and he thought it a bad time to renew
them while they werem open Violation of Jaw.
But whenever ll ey should resume pajment, and
act in accordante with the provisions of their char-
ters, h would be for granting them new ones, with
such conditions and restrictions as the wisdom of
Congress might devise for the protection of thecom-
munity. He could not now tell whether these baijks
