Second Wisconsin Battery, 119; cavalry, 24; making a total of 1,654 men available for duty, including officers. The troops appear to be in a good state of discipline, their camps are in excellent condition and the duty of the post is satisfactory performed. A change will be made in the location of two of the camps to positions better calculated to control prisoners in case of any attempt on their part, or by the assistance of others, to liberate themselves. The guard is sufficiently strong for the number of prisoners now here, 11,000, but in the expectation that an additional 5,000, or perhaps, temporarily, a greater number will be sent here, I respectfully recommend that a regiment of disciplined troops or two regiments of military be added to the guard. The force here should be strong enough not only control the prisoners, but to resist any raid which the enemy might be led to undertake, or to detach a command to the Virginia shore in case of necessity.

There are tow gun-boats lying off the depot, one a sailing vessel, but I am informed by the commanding officer that he is frequently left with the sailing vessel alone, which makes him comparatively helpless in unfavorable winds or a calm, and exposes him to capture by an unexpected attack. I would therefore respectfully recommend that application be made to the Navy Department for a steam gun-boat to be stationed permanently at the depot, to guard against a descent of the enemy from the Virginia shore and to overawe the prisoners. The two vessels should if possible be generally present, but if one is detached it should be the sailing vessel.

The prison camp is in excellent condition. There are 563 officers, 10,192 enlisted men and 192 citizens; in all, 10,947 prisoners. The officers are kept separate from the enlisted men. Too much room has been given to the officers, which will be remedied by removing the partition fence, so as to enlarge the inclosure occupied by the men, while that for the officers will be much reduced. A thousand to fifteen hundred officers may be accommodated here if necessary, but they will be sent to Fort Delaware in preference.

The sick are in hospital tents, well arranged and in good condition, but additional accommodations will be required when other prisoners are brought here, and as a matter of economy I respectfully recommend that suitable shed building be constructed. A report of what is required and an estimate of the cost will be submitted.

In consequence of the difficulty of obtaining laborers at this post, the quartermaster has been permitted to employ prisoners of war as laborers on the wharf for unloading vessels and other purposes, paying them at the rate of 9 cents per day in tobacco purchased with the prison fund. This arrangement is of great convenience to the service and very economical, and there seems to be no objection to it, provided the prisoners while so employed are carefully guarded. Thus far nothing has occurred to show that the practice should be discontinued. The prisoners very cheerfully volunteer to be so employed, as it relieves them for the ennui of confinement. Other labors of policing, making roads, and improving the grounds are performed by the prisoners, for which they have been compensated in the same way. I respectfully recommend that the continuance of this practice be authorized.

I have the honor to submit here instructions from His Excellency the President to Major-General Butler authorizing the discharge of prisoners of war on certain conditions,* with a copy of General Butler's instructions to Brigadier-General Marston, then commanding the depot, directing him to carry out the President's orders, and I
