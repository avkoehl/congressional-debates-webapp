TALIAFERRO,

General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 5, 1864.

Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Adams' Run, S. C.:

Send Ransone's company to occupy Battery Palmer. Let Jenkins retain the infantry with him. He must do all he can to check any advance on Stono road to rear of Pringle. He must, if possible, ascertain strength and movements of enemy, and whether they have artillery. It is of the last importance to prevent enemy from obtaining a position on the Stono to enfilade the lines on James Island.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
