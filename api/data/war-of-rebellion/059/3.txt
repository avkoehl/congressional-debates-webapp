Major General U. S. GRANT:

I pushed forward with my advance to this place yesterday. The remainder of my troops will come up to-day. The enemy is still in force in my front. Longstreet has no infantry away unless it may be Ransom's division. I have not been able to learn anything of that division. I am has been raining heavily for two days and the roads are nearly impassable. It will be impossible for me to do much until I get the railroad bridge across the Holston completed.
