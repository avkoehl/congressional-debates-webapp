HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Aquia, May 18, 1862. (Received 5 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am told here that the work of rebuilding the wharf at this place (Aquia) will be further delayed if plank does not arrive here by to-morrow morning, and they have no advices of any being on the way. The work has already been delayed several days for want of plank, and a most serious inconvenience it has been, for the little temporary wharf of boats at Belle Plain does not admit of stores being landed fast enough for daily consumption, and we want the depot here so that the railroad may carry our supplies beyond Fredericksburg before we take to our wagons. They also want ten kegs 6-inch morning I noticed a schooner loaded with lumber off the arsenal wharf.

Major-General SHIELDS,

Warrenton:

By a telegram from your staff officer received this morning it would see that you do not understand it to be the wish of General McDowell that you should move with your division to this point at once. This is his expectation. He is now in Washington, and you will doubltess hear from him direct on the subject.

Major-General McDOWELL,

Commanding Department of the Rappahannock:

Arrived here last night. All safe. In excellent condition. Ready to move to-day. Will make necessary requisition to-day. My artillery ammunition bad. Inquire into this. Not to be depended on. Must be something wrong. We have tried it effectually. My artillery is excellent, but ammunition wretched.
