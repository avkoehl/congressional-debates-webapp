General R. E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia, Richmond.

SIR: Lieutenant Fellers, Company G, Thirteenth Regiment of South Carolina Infantry, is now at Fortress Monroe waiting to be exchanged, according to the information I have from the War Department, for Lieutenant Underhill, of the Eleventh Regiment of New York Volunteers, who is said to be a prisoner at Richmond. I am prepared to send Lieutenant Fellers within your lines at City Point upon an intimation from you that Lieutenant Underhill has been released.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

General LEE:

No arrangement of the sort has been made and individual exchanges are declined.

We will exchange generally or according to some principle, but not by arbitrary selections.

Secretary of War.

CORINTH, MISS., June 14, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

I think it will be well to make as many of the enemy give their parole as possible; still it would not be worth while to pursue those who have deserted and are on their home. I would come and see you but have for several days been confined to my tent with the "evacuation of Corinth. "

I cannot make an exception in this case.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,
