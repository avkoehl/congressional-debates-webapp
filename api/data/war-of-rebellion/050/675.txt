Hospital Steward Dunnen, and 4 musicians were captured at the field hospital, near Gordon's Mills.

The command was most unfortunate in its positions on both days, but, under all the circumstances, behaved with the most commendable valor where valor could be available for good. I cannot wonder that after more than half its officers and men were killed and wounded up to noon of the 20th, and many others were unavoidably separated from the command during the terrible struggle of the 19th, and by the overwhelming force thrown upon the flank of the brigade while marching to the left on the 20th, completely crushing it, and dashing it to atoms, as it were, against the hill in the rear, the remnant of the men, still gathered around their colors with their officers, pressed farther and farther back by continued flank attacks, left entirely without support, and nearly surrounded, should fall in with the immense columns of troops moving to the rear, and seek, with the rest, a place of safety. It might have been wiser to have done so sooner.

The following are the casualties of the command during the actions of the 19th and 20th: The staff surgeon, McGavran, captured at field hospital; Captain Ewing, Company B, acting major, wounded and captured; non-commissioned Staff Serg. Major B. A. Rabe wounded; Hospital Steward V. E. Dunnen captured at field hospital.
