had siege guns, and men to work them, on the cliffs, we might in that way annoy them, and might do some damage to the wooden boats. Against the iron boats, of course, we could do no damage, but if our force was down below, where the gunboats are, they might by their presence deter the negroes from running off, and would prevent the landing of the enemy in boats for the purpose of taking the negroes on board, and in that way save the negroes to our farmers, and at the same time afford them security in their persons, and enable them to save their crops.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. S. LEE,

Commandant.

Should you be able to subsist your army in that position by drawing flour in that region of country, and not hear that the enemy is pushing on on the route to Richmond, I desire you will halt there. Should you hear they the enemy is advancing on to Richmond, you will proceed by the most direct route, and place yourself behind the Rapidan.
