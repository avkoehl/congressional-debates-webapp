No. 109. Report of Lieutenant Colonel George H. Woods, U. S. Army, Chief Commissary of Subsistence.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,Office of Chief Commissary, May 21, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to make the following report of events that transpired in the subsistence department of this corps between the 28th ultimo and the 6th instant:

On the evening of the 28th ultimo, the troops of this corps left camp, with three days' cooked rations in haversacks, and five days' of hard bread, coffee, sugar, and salt, in knapsacks.

On the morning following the marching of the troops, with 312 head of beef-cattle (about six days' supply for this command), I came to the large meadow near which the corps was bivouacked, and corralled the cattle about a quarter of a mile from where you headquarters were on the morning of the 29th.

After reporting to you in person at your new headquarters the position of the cattle, I procured wagons and obtained forage for the cattle, and in the evening again reported at headquarters, and remained there, with the exception of two hours, until 12 m. on the 30th, at which time your inspector-general informed me that we were to move quickly, silently, and through the ravines, to Banks' Ford, above Falmouth.

Following these instructions, I started the herd immediately in the rear of the column, and came to Boscobel, were, after consulting with yourself, I concluded to hold the cattle that night, giving them the benefit of rest of food, and also considering it unsafe to drive them so far at night. It may be well to remark here that, prior to leaving the lower ford, orders had been given to replace the rations that had been consumed. This generally was done, but, I am sorry to say, in some instances the troops refused to receive the new rations that were issued
