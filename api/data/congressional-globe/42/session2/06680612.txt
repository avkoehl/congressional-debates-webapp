vey, Lowe, Maxson, McFarland, Price, Riggs,

Question., Will you look over them ? [Sub-
mitting the senate journal above mentioned.]
Answer. Mr. Abbott has held an office—
Indian agent.
Question. When was Mr. Abbott appointed
Indian agent ?
Answer. I cannot say. I think he was an
Indian agent at that time. It occurs to me
that he resigned his Indian agency after he was
elected, as there was some difficulty about his
being an Indian agent and in the senate at the
same time. I may be mistaken about that.
Question. After the election was he reap-
pointed to his Indian agency?
Ariswer. If I am correct he was, if he was
the man.

Answer. Some time—a year or two.

register or receiver of the land office.

sas is a United States officer eligible to be a
member of the Legislature?
Answer. He is not.
Question. Then he was not in the land office
at that time ?
Answer. He was not.
Question. Was he afterward ?
Answer. He was afterward.
Question. About how long after that elec-
tion ?
Answer. I cannot say.
Question. Go on to the next.

the office of mail agent for a few months.
Question. When did he hold that office—how
long after ?
Answer. I cannot say ; I have no recollec-

that I recollect about; those are all the sen-

roy was John Hannon.
Question. That you secured ?
Answer. Yes, sir; through my influence I
got him to vote for Pomeroy. He was a Dem-
ocrat.
Question. He drank some of Martin's
whisky?
Answer. I presume he did. We didn't call
that Martin's whisky, we called it Pomeroy's
whisky. I do not see any of these represent-
atives that I recollect now of holding an office.
