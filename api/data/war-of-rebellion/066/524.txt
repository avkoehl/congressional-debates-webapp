CHARLESTON, S. C., June 8, 1864.

Colonel J. C. IVES,

Aide-de-Camp, Richmond, Va.:

Your telegram received. I have been apprehending mischief from Port Royal or Jacksonville for some days, and called on Governor Brown and General Johnston for Georgia Reserves, but got none. We recently burned a transport on Ashepoo, with a number of cavalry horses, estimated at 200, all burned, and on the 2nd instant General Anderson drove back the enemy from Baldwin to Jacksonville. These two checks will, I hope, interfere somewhat with any raid they may have in contemplation. I will make every effort in my power to frustrate their designs. I can hear of no South Carolina Reserves in the field yet.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 8, 1864.

Colonel C. J. COLCOCK, Pocotaligo, S. C.:

Keep a vigilant lookout on the enemy's movements about Port Royal. I apprehend that they are organizing a large raiding party there. Have your cavalry and light batteries in readiness to concentrate at shortest notice to meet them. Generals McLaws and Robertson will be instructed to re-enforce you if necessary. Keep me informed.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C, June 8, 1864.

Major General L. McLAWS, Savannah, Ga.:

It is apprehended from information received that enemy is fitting out large raiding party at Port Royal to go to Augusta, destroy powder mills, thence to Andersonville and release prisoners. The President has directed Generals Johnston and Cobb to send me some State reserves. Keep a vigilant lookout, and if the raid moves through Third Military District of South Carolina, take direction of affairs there yourself, and send there from Savannah all force you can. General Robertson will re-enforce you if necessary. To save time, I have telegraphed direct to Colonel Colcock. Keep me informed.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 8, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE W. RAINS, Augusta, Ga.:

It is apprehended that the enemy is preparing for a raid from Port Royal to Augusta. Urge forward the local organizations, and inform me what progress is made in it. Your own men and all clerks and employees in railroads and other offices should be enrolled and armed ready for service.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
