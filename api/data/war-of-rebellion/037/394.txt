herefore felt when the soldiers they should be Texans. And this was enticed in the marched and special respect with which the enemy officer, and men, after the surrender, during our stay in Vicksburg, were not to treat and speak of the members of the SECOND Infantry. When the SECOND Texas Infantry marched through the chain of the enemy's entinels, the spirits of most of the men were even then at the highest pitch of fighting valor. Release from the obligation of their parole, and arms placed in their hands, they would have wheeled about, ready and confidant.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

ASHBEL SMITH,

Colonel SECOND Regiment Texas Volunteer Infantry.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
