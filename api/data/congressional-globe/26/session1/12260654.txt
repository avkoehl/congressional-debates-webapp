Jndtpendent Treasury—Mr. Hastings.
H. ot Rep .
what promotes tbat circumstance? And the re-
sponse must be—making money out of paper, in-
stead of earning it by industry, to pay for 'he
goods; credits on iuapoit duties; and collecting
those duties in the paper money that the banks
maaufacture to pay for the goods, and placing the
public revenues in the same banks to assist in
making the paper money. But tb« more remote
the fundamental cause that has permitted all this;
the root of the evil, as we might call it, and which
has never yet been considered in a correct, just
point of view, that I know of, I will endeavor to
explain after a little. But, as I was saying, the
immediate can<e is buying more lh*n we sell, and
incurring a heavy balance of trade against u*—an
unthrifty business, that plain, thinking people
would say we should have understood and re-
formed long ago. Well, be it so; but we may
excusa ourselves l y saying we have been imposed
upon by delusions, by fallacies-; by being told that
a profusion of bank notes is necessary to develope
the resources of the country; that the apparent ba-
lance of trade is not the real one; that gold and
silver are not as good currency as bank notes; and
until very lately, when the working people have
been fallen most violently in love with, that they
did not understand their true interests; that
the credit system, as banking is called, is
the paradise of prosperity for our Republic.
Now, in my simple opinion, and with all due defe-
rence to those who live without doing any thing,
credit depends upon such an almost endless variety
of contingencies, that it cannot be reduced to a sys-
tem at all: however, as the objection may be called
cynical, let it pass. But one grand assertion, and
the only true one, I think, among the whole, is, that
the country prospers, notwithstanding all the unto-
ward circumstances it has been laboring under.
And it has, that's certain, likeajoung, independ-
ent, persevering, spirited man, who has a fashiona-
ble, managing, breeches-wearing wife to support,
that gets him in debt over and over again—and be
keeps working over and over aga'n, improving all
the time though—to pay it. At length he takes
heart of grace, turns over a new le.if with the
wife, incurs no more debt, persists in industry and
thrift, and goes ahead in prosperity, independence,
and happiness—just as the working people mean
ti do now, Mr. Chairman. And toencourage them
to persevere in this good rcolution, if they should
see these remarks, I will submit an extract from ex-
position No. 4 of the Governor of Ohio's message
in 1837, by "A Democrat," to let them see what
prosperity might have been attained by five years of
this balance of trade. The writ r say?: "The ex-
cess of our importations over our exhortations for
the five years preceding the present bank suspen-
sions was—
In 1832        .... $14,000,000
1833    .... 18,000,000
1834    .... 23000,000
1835    .... 28000,000
1836    .... 61,000,000
$ 144,000,000"
And, to illustrate how this balance might hare
promoted our prosperity in various ways, he says:
"What would this $144,000,000 have done for us?
At $20,000 a mile, it would have made 7,200 miles
of railroad or canal. At $20 an acre, it would
have cleared and fenced in the best manner 7,200,-
000 acres of land. At $1 25 an acre, it would
have purchased, out of tue public domain, 720,000
farms, at 160 acres each. At $2,000 a piece.it
would have bought, of the same public land, built a
substantial house and barn, and cleared and fenced
80 acres on each, 72,000 larms, of 100 acres. At
$500 each, it would have set up 283,000 mechanics,
with families. At $50,000 a pi<xe, it would have
established 2,880 manufactories, which would have
employed and paid 570,000 of our own people
here at home, instead of the same number ia Eu-
rope, and made fabrics to the amount of $159,000,-
000 a year at least. Or, in coin, it would have
taken the place of the same amount of bank notes,
making our specie circulation, with the $8,000,000
we now possess, $224,000,000. And what have
bank expansions and contractions, and their other
tortuous proceedings, given us in lieu of «those ad-
vantages? Idleness and speculation, and a greater
propensity to luxury; a growing dis'aste forho.iest
industry, and deterioration of morals; an increase
of aristocratic taint, and consequent distaste for,
and falling off from, republican principles; critical
revulsions in our political and domestic economy;
and privations, and sufferings, and acrimonious re-
criminations in party, and vexations of spirit."
"A Democrat," Mr. Chairman, asks what this
$144,000,000 would have done ¡or us? and I ask
what would five limes the sum have done fur us?
for I find that thi balance of trade from 1789 to
1837 is more than that. Our imports to the last
date, 1837, have been $4,067,975,705, and our ex-
ports $3,315,287,888, leaving a ba'ance against us
of $752,687,817. And this had all to be paid by
labor—by the sweat of the worker's brow! Is not
this, sir, an astounding fact for the people ot this
Union to reflect upon? and will they not take nut-
ters into their own hands, and remedy it? "Will
they ever be the victims ef delusion, and reject so-
ber reality? No, sir, they will not. The illusive
day dream of making money out of paper, instead
of earning it ay honest, patient industry, is p*st.
Paper may be a handmaid to specie, and u^ed to a
useful extent, but nothing more. Those who have
to support the fabric of our prosperity by their
hands will see to it—all will be right, and inde-
pendence and happiness will follow.
I forgot to mention, Mr. Chairman, that the in-
terest upon this balance of trade of $752,687,817
would be upward of $45,000,000 a year—about
double what would pay the expenses of the Go-
vernment. And of this balance of trade—this im-
mense increase of the toils of the working man,
imposed upon him chiefly by the paper fallacy and
credit duties—nearly one-half was incurred during
the operations of the late United States Bank. And
what has caused this slate of things? the credit sys-
tem, as it is misnamed; in other word?, the paper
money system, excessive banking, and credits on
duties, as I taid before; it is plain as the noorday
sun. And what do those who have inflicted this
monetary disease upon us—who have nurtured and
sustained it—propose for a remedy?—no less than
a further trial of the cause that induced i'—a
continued dose of the paper phantom itself! I
am tempted, Mr. Chairman, to say that this is
laughable; but it is too solemn to be laughed
at; it hazards our liberties. No, sir; I ask the
people of tbis Union, and more particularly the
working part of them—from whose labors all has to
ba extracted, all has to be paid—to take this matter
into their most serious, their most grave considera-
tion; to be trifled with no longer, to dtcide, to act,
to apply the remedy, and to make the reformation
—wisely, and cautiously, aad gradually, but as
certain as fate itself; and they will do it, sir; they
will do this thing; they will dissipate this inordinate
paper money delusion; and all will be well; they
prize their independence too highly not to do it.
Among the manifold evils that the late United
States Bank inflicted on the country, and which
have been well depicted moie or less by the gen-
tlemen who have spoken on the subject, there is
one that a remark of the gentleman from Ken-
tucky reminded me Gf, and no light one either.
Among the advan'ages which that gentleman,
(whom I highly esteem for his candor and sincerity
of opinion,) in his remarks, ascribed to it, he stated
that it was a great accommodation to widows and
orphans, and aged gentlemen, to make secure in-
vestments in, from which to receive good and
punctually paid dividents. As a commentary up-
on these opinions, I will state a few facts, from
which conclusions may be drawn that will not war-
rant the correctness of these opinions.
The report to Congress, January, 1819, afte.*
describing the various surrep'itious proceedings of
the Bank to raise the stock as high as possible be-
yond the original price, that the speculator, who
had possessed hjmself of it for the very purpose of
selling it to ihe innocent and unwary, such as the
gentleman has described, should be more entiched,
says: "The effect of these different proceedings
was that, on the last of December, 1816, Bank of
the United States stock was at 4U for 30 paid; in
April, at 81 for 65; in May, at 98; on the 20th of
August, at 144 for 100 paid; on the 30th of Au-
gust, at 156J; at whjch price it remained for some
days, and thtn besan to decline."
It appears further, that, in the reckless efforts to
raise the stock to the above prices, the bank had
sunk above $3,500,000, and that, on the report of
the investigating committee in Washington, reach-
ing Philadelphia, the stock fell to 93. There was
rapid work for ye—from 156A to 93. Those of
the widows and orphans, and aged gentlemen,who
were obliged to sell out under this depression,
must have made desperate losses.
About this time the situation of the Bank was
very perilous; at one moment it had only about
$70,000 in its vaults. A Bank of $35,000,000 re-
duced to $70,000 in specie! What a safe institu-
tion to make investments in for either profit or se-
curity ! Thenceforward it wa i obliged, it seems,
to reimburse its capital from its dividends—a very
honest, just measure toward those who had con-
fided in its faith, and bought its stock at extrava-
gantly advanced prices from its stockholders, de-
pending on the dividends for their support. Here
isa detail of the operation in a table, of the whole
of its semi-annual dividends. It is a curiosity, but
not a pleasing one, even at this day, to the inno-
cent purchasers of its stock, at high prices, from
unfeeling knaves, who have reduced many of these
confiding sufferers to poverty and distress, while
they are living on in luxury and dissipation, per-
haps, and exerting themselves to continue the same
impositions that enriched them. It is necessary to
lay it before the committee, for the better under-
standing of the considerations it has induced.

In looking over this detail of dividends, we are
naturally led to inquire what privations many of
the orphans, and widows, and aged gentlemen,
must have experienced from 1819 to 1828; and
particularly those who had purchased the stock at
the inflated prices, as high as 1564—which a vast
portion of them did; deriving no income whatso-
ever from it during two years, and, for several
years, a mere irifle. For it must be observed, that,
when the dividend was only 24, those who had
paid $150 for $100, for instance, were receiving
only 1$, or $3 33¿ per annum; and if they were
obliged to sell out when the stock was down to $93,
would sink $380 in $1,000- An acquaintance of
mine, who had bought at $140, thinking it a wise
investment—no  better security than the United
