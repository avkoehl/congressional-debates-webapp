Major-General DIX,

Commanding Department of Virginia:

SIR: As yet I have obtained no reliable information concerning the landings on the Pamunkey. The change of commanders of the gunboats has caused some unavoidable delay. Commander Creighton thinks he will get some news from that quarter shortly, and I will go up to West Point to-morrow with him and point out such features of the country as I am acquained with. He has spies out at this time. One of the two scouts sent out from the Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry was left sick by his companion in the woods. He has not yet returned, and I fear he has fallen into the hands of the enemy. It is very difficult to penetrate the enemy's lines, and the reports brought by refugees are too conflicting to be relied upon. It appears to be nearly certain that the enemy has a force at the White House, at or near Slatersville, and at Diascond bridge. Their pickets guard the shore of the Pamunkey from the White House to the mouth, and we shall not be able to land without their notice, and perhaps not without their opposition. The new regiments are doing well in their drill generally, and it will be dangerous to trust them before the enemy until they reach a certain point of discipline and instruction.

I remain, &amp;c.,

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General.
