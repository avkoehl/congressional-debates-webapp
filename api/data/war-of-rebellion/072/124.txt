Report of Captain Thomas G. Baylor, Ordnance Corps, U. S. Army, Chief of Ordnance.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, OFFICE OF CHIEF OF ORDNANCE,Atlanta, Ga., September 18, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to inclose herewith a list of ordnance and list of ammunition expended in the campaign, from May 4 to September 8, 1864. The expenditures of ammunition were quite large, still at no time during the campaign, notwithstanding the several interruptions of our railroad communications, were we without a good supply.

Great credit is due Lieutenant Colonel G. W. Schofield, chief of ordnance, Army of the Ohio; Captain D. H. Buel, chief of ordnance, Army of the Tennessee; Lieutenant O. E. Michaelis, acting chief of ordnance, Army of the Cumberland, and Capts. E. F. Townsend, S. H. Hogan, and S. W. Armstrong, in charge of ordnance depots, for zeal and efficiency in the discharge of their duties.

Captain D. H. Buel was captured on the 7th instant, near Rough and Ready, bringing a dispatch from Major-General Howard to you, by a scouting party of Jackson's cavalry. It was very unfortunate to be taken prisoner just at the close of the campaign, when our army wa marching to occupy Atlanta, the object and result of its four month's operations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. G. BAYLOR,

Captain and Chief of Ordnance, Mil. Div. of the Miss.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.
