The Uem for allowances to the law agent,

eration,
Mi WHITE, the Delegate from Florida,
' moved 'o str ke out " law agen ,"to insert§4 050
instead of Jj5 550, and to add a provi&o tiat none
of the money should be paid out of the Treasury
ti'l the cleims had been adj tdi"ated, and entered
into an explmat on of some lergth in support of
his proposition
Mi POLK siid, in reference to this >cm,mfor
mation was asked from the department, and Mr
P read a letter from the Secretary of tne Treas-
ury of the x4th January, setting forth that the
appropna'ion wes in conformity to an act of Ccn
giessofl^B Mr P also recited the c'ause of
' that act, and c t d the amounts of former years
showing that twas less 'Hal heretofore He «aw
no occasion for the reduction of the amount, or
I for adopting the proviso, nor could he perceive
how it could be done cons stently -with the public
interest, at least not until the act referred to had
been repealed
After some further comerseüon between Mr
MERCER, Mr FOLK, and WH11E, of Flor
ida, the question on the anaendmert was taken
and decided in the affirmative—ayes 81, noes not
counted
I On the item for the purchase of hw books for
' the office of the Attoiney General, <j3,000,
Mr POLK moved to insert §2,0U0 instead of
1 £3,000
Mi J Q, ADAMS wished to know at what
j period the principle for this appropriation was
I adopted
j Mr POT K replied, when Mr Berrien was
• Attorney General, an apprcprmtion of §500 had
been made Mr P then sent to theCierK's table
a letter fiom the present Attorney General, sett rg
forth that there had been no provision consistent
with the importance of the office, for a Library,
and that those officers had hitherto been com-
pelled to report to the Library of Congress, or
depend upon their private lesouices Mi Eutler
Sad been favored wuh the use of Ml Taney's
p «ate ltbraiy, of which he would soon neces-
sarily be deprived If Congi ss would make an
appropriation of thiee thousand dollars, it would
he-eafter oniy leojire three or foui hundred
dollars annually to supply the necessary new
publications
Mr J a ADAMS was unsatisfied, foi he could
see no reason wny the Attorney General should
be fu-n shed w th a library at the expense of the
country Mr A moved to strike out the whole
Clause
Mr FOSTER thought, on the contrary, tnat a
library in the office of the Attorney General was
indispensable, and should be furnished at the public
expense Mi i advocated the propriety of the
aopropna ion with some energy, ard said, he
thought it the most reasonable application ever
made to that House
Mr D J PEARCE opposed the item and said,
without some betlei cause than had been assigned,
he saw no valid íeason why the appropriation
should be made A consiJerible amount of the
SLin assigned for the ¡urcliaseof books for the
uoraiy of Congress was always expended in the
purchase or books for the department of law, to
which theAttoi ley GenerU had at all tunes ready-
access
Mr POLK further explained
The ques'ion was then taken on Mr J <ü.
Ada^is's motion to strike out the whole clause,
which was m atived   Ayes 53, noes 72
Mr POLK'S motion to amend the clause bv
inserting $2 0 0 instead of $3,000 was then agreed
to without a division
On the clause for compensation to the district
attorneys and marshals being read,
Mr FOSTER moved an additional item for
compensation fo the district attorney of South
Carol ia, ard for the marshal of Delawaie
Mi POLK inquired if this was in pursuance
of any 'aw
Mr IOSTER replied in the negative, but ad-
vocated the expediency of the appropriation
Mr POLK thought it could only be done mider
a special act, and suggested to Mr Foster to
withdraw his amendment, and a special bill might
be introduced to meet the object
Mr FOSTER then withdrew his amendment,
and the clause, as it stood, was adopted
On the following item being read, appropriating
$300,000, for defraying the expenses of the Su-
preme, cncuit, and district couits of the United
States, oV ,
Mr PARKER inquired how it was that this
amount had increased from the amount of last
year, which was then $260,000
Mr POLK said the increase of this item aid not
escape the attention of the committee, who had
made the necessary inquiry of the Treasury De-
partment, and it was founded on estimates which
had been furnished by the marshals of the several
States Mr P then sent to the Clerk's table a
table of the various items, which was read, and
the clause was agreed to
The clause " to make good a deficiency m the
funds for the relief of sick and disabled seamen,
&c , §25,000" having been read,
Mr J Q. ADAMS asked how this deficiency
had been created
Mi POLK explained and produced a document
from the Secretary of the Treasury, setting forth
that the deficiency actually existed fiom an excess
of expend ture
Mr J Q, ADAMS said, though he should not
move to strike out the clause, he deemed it a very
improper one, since it led to the expendituie of
money without the authority of law
Mi CAMBRELE1NG said, the expenditure
was necessaiiiy a fluctuating one The gentleman
from Massachusetts was in error about the law;
seamen abroad who became disabled must, by
law, be sent home by consuls, and thus the actual
amount could not be anticipated
The conversation then dropped
Mr REYNOLDS moved to amend the clause
providing for the suivey of tne public lands, by
adding for "suiveymg lots in Peoria, Illinois,
$500 "
Mi  R said, he had made inquiry at the Treas-
