ly; and, although the facts may not strictly amount
to a legal contract between the parties, it is certainly
so nearly allied to one, that it would be doing the
greatest injustice to the States and People to disap-
point their just expectations, by withholding the in-
stalment.
Again it was admitted by the chairman of the
Committee on Finance that, if the instalment was
retained, being in paper, it could not be made avail-
able in aid oí the necessities of the Treasury, as the
Government would not u-e papet, and we -would
still have to authorize an issue of Treasury notes,
and aloan of at least $10,000,000 Why then with-
hold it from the States, who are willing to receive tt
in the very funds the Government i ejects, and, in
many instances, can accommodate the matter with
their own deposite banks, beneficially to the Govern-
ment, the bank, and the States?
But, viewing it as a question of inconvenience
between the Government and the States, how stands
the case? It would certainly be much less incon-
venient to the Government to add the amount of
the instalment to the amount of the loan she is com-
pelled to make, at all event, than it would be to
the States to lose the benefit of the money at this
time. These, sir, are some of the reasons that in-
duced me to vote against that bill Itnought it but
justice to myself to state them, as I gave a silent
vote on that occasion
Sir, I have been surprised to heai this great sub-
ject argued here as if it were really a question be-
tween the Government on the one side, and the mer-
chants and banks on the other—as it the great body
of the People had no stake or interest m the matter.
Do gentlemen really suppose that the bank  and
merchants are not creditor  as well as debtors1 Do
they not know that for ever} dollar the batiks and
merchants owe, the People ano the ti at least as
much'! Do they not know that you ca inot oppiess
the banks and the meichants without producing a
corresponding pressure on their debtors, the People1
"Will not the importing merchants call upon their
debtois, the retail merchants1 The retail merchants
are involved, but are they alone1 No, sir, they
go to thpr debtors, the People, with then demand
augmented by their profits on the goods The
whole, sir, falls on the consumer In this way the
disasteis of all classes m the countiy are necessarily
identified Sir, you cannot oppress the banks or
the merchants, unless \ou, by the same measures,
embarrass their customers, the People it \ou put
your iron hand on them, they resort to the People,
and on the people ultimately the evil must fall It
is not the fact, that this is a controversy between
the Government and the banks and importing mer-
chants It is a question involving the interests and
prosperity oí the entire country, and, sir, I am glad
it is so I shouid be extrt mely sorry to see the time
when the great mteiests of 'he community shall be
so separated that one mav fa'l without the otheis
They are all embarked in the samo national vessel,
bound to the same port, and equal legaid shouid
be paid to them all
It is admitted on all bands that, tbioughout the
countrj, irom one end to the othei, confidence is
destioyed Yet it is said, trulj, mat \ic possess all
the elements of pro pent/, w hich only require to be

such and so gieat i the dc m"* in of puKio confi
dence and the derangement ot th" ei,n<mcv indine
exchanges But we are told tiom ve } h Ji au-
thority that the Government Ins nothi- g to do \uth
the exchanges, that the mcteh mis must mamge
them themselves, or that other means must be pr< -
vided than those of Government If, bj this doc-
trine, I am to understand that Government has no
power to fix the )ate ot exchanges, I admit jts di-
rectness    But if the Executive means to say that
Government has no power to aid in the application
of the appropriate remedy for the deranged and
obstructed exchanges of the country, I wholly dis-
agree with him Sir, it is an after thought, to an-
swer a particular occasion It is an opinion never
advanced before by any statesman Such, sir, was
not the opinion of President Jackson or his advi-
sers, at any time of his administration
It will be íecollected that, during the time of the
bank war, when the poner of the Executive Gov-
ernment was arrayed against the Bank of the Unit-
ed States, it was declared that one of the impoitant
functions of the bank, due to the interests of the
People, was to regulate the t xchanges , and there-
fore it was contended that it ought to be continued
as the Government agent On the opposite side, it
was contended that the local banks, the State banks,
the Government deposite banks, would íegulate Ihe
exchanges with as much advantage to the Peop'e
of the United Stales as the United States Bank
\.ad yet it never was contended that the powei of
the Government, in its fiscal operations could not
be constitutionally directed so as to regulate the ex-
changes of the country Allow me, &ir, to read an
extract irom President Jackson himself, m which
the regulation of the exchanges was considered an
important pait of the duties of the fiscal agent of
the Government oí the United S'aíes. The Presi-
dent, considering the matter of so mnch importance,
uses the following language, for the purpose of
satisfying the 'Vmencan People that the lot al banks,
while thev would perform equally w ell the ordina-
ry duties of the Bank of the United States, would
also perform the same office equally well, in regu-
lating the exchanges of the counti v     He saj s
" Experience continues to ieah¿e Ihe expectations
entertained, as to the cipacity of the State binks
to perform the duties of fiscal agents foi the Gov-
ernment At the time of the removal of the de-
posites, it was alleged by the advocates of the Bank
of the United Slates, that the State banks, what-
evei might be the regulations of the Treasury De-
partment, could not make the transfers required by
the Government, or negotiate the domestic exchanges
of the country It is now well ascertained that the
real domestic exchanges, performed through discosnk
by thp United States Bank and its twenty-five
branches, were, at least, one-third l°ss than those
of the deposite banks for an equal period of time ,
and if a comparison be instituted between the
amount of seivice rendered by these íns'itulions, on
the broadei basis whuh has been Uéed by the advo-
cates of the United States Bank in estimating what
they consider the domestic exchanges tiansacted by it,
the result will be still more favorable to the deposite
banks "—Message o/1836."
Does any one suppose that President Jackson
and his cabiret would have thought it so important
to satisfy the public mind of the abilitv of die de-
posite banks, as fiscal agents oi the Gov °rnment,
lo íegulate and assist m procuring a whoesonie
state of the domestic exchanges, n, m truth and in
fact, the Government hid no constitutional r ght to
act m the matter'
It appears, sii, noma paper bow befoie re, that
such a'so vveie the view¿ of Mr Van B ir"n, as e\-
jiressed m his lettei to Shenod WiHiPim. I read
this, s r, for ihe pu pose of show in.; that ih s idea oí
den}mgto the Gov ermuent, through its f seal agents,

"The officiil lepons of the % creti v of the
Tieasurj s'ovv, first, that the avcage amount ot
money annualty transfened by the Bank ot the
United States, fiom 1S20 to 1823, was irom ten to
fifteen million > of doll its , aid the amount trans-
iened by deposite banks trom June, 1S35, to 'i.piil,
183C, or about ten months, over seventeen millions
of dollars, m both case , the operativa has been
without loss, failure, or expense In rega rd t0 do-
mestic exchangee, the following facts aie also estab-
lished by the same authentic source, viz That 'be
amount of domestic exchanges, performed at the lasf
leturns by the deposite banks, exceeded thirty five
millions of dolíais, and at no return, for many
months, has it been less than twenty five millions ;
which, at an aveiage of thirty millions, at each re-
turn, would be, in a >ear, one hundred and eighty
millions, if each bill oí exchange run on an average
of sixty d íys '
Now, sir, do not genfleir'en see the vast amount
of the currency Of the coHPt/v opera'ing as a circu-
lating medium, wh.ch ais-umes the chaiacter of bills
of exchange i and do they not see! the fatal conse-
quences to the business and prosperity of the coun-
try, resulting fiom the derangement of i^is Parl of
the medium of cneulation, and the vast importance
of íegulatmg it bv the fiscal agent of the Gov'FJ&-
ment, as no othei power can do it1   Sir, it appear* 
conclusive to my mind, that when Mr. Van Buren
was canvassing for the Presidency, he did not pre-
tend that the Government had not the power to aid
in the legulation of the currency and the exchan-
ges     I think, sir, I have sustained the  posilioa
clearly, that such was not the opinion of the late
Executive, and that such was not the view of Mr.
Van Burrn vhgn he vv as canvassing for the Presi-
dency    But now, in older to sustain the divorce
bill, winch wi'hdiaws ihe aid of Government in
regulating the amiencv and exchanges, it is neces-
sary lo repudiate the ld^a *hat Government should
aid m íegulatinsr the cuirency and the «xchange?,
and to   show  that  she has no pover  over  this
matter
A gam  sir   we hear from difiVtnt quarters—f
know not whence it originates—but we heai the cry
of " propose your questions, bring forward your
counter-propositions, if you are opposed to those of
the Administration; this is a contest between the
aristocracy of wealth and the demociacy of num-
bers "   Sir, I know not what the aristocracy is like,
or of what it is composed.   There may be sucha
thing in some of the older States, but it is unknown
m the State from which I come    There, all are on
an equality , or, rather, there is but one  hue of
distinction between hem, and thatis the lme which
divides vice from virtue,   honest)  from  villany
every man standing on his own merits, w ithout re-
gard to those factitious and invidious distinctions
But, even if such a line existed, aie we to an ay
one class of citizens against another—to excite envy
and enmity on the one part, and contempt and
hatred on the other1    No, sir , under this Govern-
ment all are on the same platform of equality, un-
influenced by artificial  distinctions not founded on
personal merit, and stimulated by the glorious con-
sideration that the door to the highest offices within
the snr' of the People is alike open to all
Sir, as to the emharrasmetits of the country—the
gteat and menacing crisis at which we have ar-
med—I have but a few wotds to offer. We must
be guided moirdv by the li^ht of experience in pro-
vidng a rt neJv Again and again has it been
asmbu\ to the sin-' caus —of o-ierti ulmg, specu-

People, it is Siid, ha\e become consumers, and not
