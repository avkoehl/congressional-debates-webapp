[Brigadier-General MITCHELL:]

The bands of guerrillas working north cross Arkansas River west of Fort Gibson and come up through Indian Nation into Bates and Vernon Counties, then north. Instruct Colonel Blair when he hears of them to strike them if possible before they get out of his reach. Sanborn cannot cross Grand or Osage Rivers on account of high water. Blair must get after them whenever the hears of them.
