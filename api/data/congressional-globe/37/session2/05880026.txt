Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Senate & Ho. of Eeps.
and national bankruptcy; all these are possible
consequences of the adoption of a system of Gov-
ernment circulation. It may be said, and per-
haps truly, that they are less deplorable than those
of an irredeemable bank circulation. Without
entering into that comparison, the Secretary eon-
tents himself with observing that, in his judgment,
these possible disasters so far outweigh the prob-
able benefits of the plan that he feels himself con-
strained to forbear recommending itsadoption.
The second plan suggested remains for exam-
ination. Its principal features are, first, a circu-
lation of notes bearing a common impression, and
authenticated byacommonauthority; second,the
redemption of these notes by the associations and
institutions to which they may be delivered for
issue, and, third, the security of that redemption
by the pledge of United States stocks, and an ade-
quate provision of specie.
In this plan the people, in their ordinary busi-
ness, would find the advantages of uniformity in
currency; of uniformity in security; of effectual
safeguard, ifeffectual saleguard is possible, against
depreciation; and of protection from losses in dis-
counts and exchanges; while in the opeiationsof
the Government the people would find the further
advantage of a large demand for Government se-
curities, of increased facilities for obtaining the
loans required by the war, and of some alleviation
of the burdens on industry through a diminution
in the rate of interest, or a participation in the
profit of circulation, without risking the perils of
a great money monopoly.
A fin ther and nnpoi tant ad vantage to the people
may he reasonably expected in the increased se-
curity of the Union, springing from the common
interest in its preservation, created by the distri-
bution of its stocks to associations throughout
the country, as the basis of their circulation.
The Secretary entertains the opinion that if a
credit circulation in any form be desirable, it is
most desirable in this. The notes thus issued and
secured would, in his judgment, form the safest
cuirencywhie.il this count) y lias ever enjoyed;
while their receivahility for all Government dues,
except customs, would make them, wherever pay-
able, of equal value, us a currency, in every part
of the Union. The. large amount of specie now
in the United States, reaching a total of not less
than $1275,000,000, will easily support payments
of duties m com, while, these payments and ordi-
nary demands will aid in retaining this specie m
the country as a solid basis both of circulation and
loans.
The whole circulation of (he country, r\'cepta
limited amount of foreign coin, would, alter the
lapse of two or three years, bear the impress of
the nation, whether in coin <n notes; while the
amount of the latter, always easily ascertainable,
and, of course, always generally known, would
not be likely to be increased beyond the real wants
of business.
He expresses an opinion in favor of this plan
with the greater confidence, because it has the ad-
vantage of recommendation from experience. It
is not an untried theory. In the State of New
York, and in one or more of the other States, jt
has been subjected, in its most essential parts, to
thejest of expei iment, and has been found prac-
ticable and useful. The piobabihties of success
will not he diminished, but increased, by its adop-
tion under national sanction, and for ihe whole
country.
It only remains to add that the plan is recom-
mended by one other consideration , which, in the
judgment of the Secretary, is entitled to much in-
fluence. It avoids almost, if" not altogether, the
evils of a great and sudden change in the currency
by ofleiing inducements to solvent existing insti-
tutions to withdraw the circulation issued undei
State authority, and substitute that provided by
the authoiity of the Union. Thus, thiough the
voluntary action of the existing institutions', aided
by wise l.-gislation, the great transition from a
currency heterogeneous, unequal, and unsafe, to
one unifoi m, equal, and safe, may be speedily and
almost imperceptibly accomplished.
If the Secretary has omitted the discussion of
the question of the constitutional power of Con-
gress to put tins plan into opeiation,it is because
no argument is uecessaiy to establish the propo-
sition that the powei to legulate commerce and
the value of coin includes the power to regulate
the currency of the country, or the collateral prop-
osition that the power to effect the end includes
the povyer to adopt the necessary and expedient
means.
The Secretary entertains the hope that the plan
now submitted, if adopted with the limitations
and safeguards which the experience and wisdom
of Senators and Representatives will, doubtless,
suggest, may impart such value and stability to
Government securities that it will not be difficult
to obtain the additional loans required for the ser-
vice of the currentand the succeeding year at fair
and reasonable lates; especially if the public credit
be supported by sufficient and certain provision
for the payment of interest and ultimate redemp-
tion of the principal.
To obtain a clear understanding of the amount
for which it will become necessary to resort to
further loans, it is requisite to review the financial
movement of the Treasury during the whole of
the last, and the first quarter of the current fiscal
year, and compare, somewhat more closely than
has already been done, the probable wants and
probable resources of the Government for the re-
maining three quarters of the current, and the
whole of the following year.
In the July report the Secretary submitted a
detailed statement, in part estimated, showing the
receipts for the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th
June, 1861, including the balance in the Treasury
at its commencement to have been $8(5,072,H93 81 >
and the expenditures to have been £>84,577,258 GO;
and the balance to have been $2,355,635 '21. Act-
ual returns show that the receipts, including bal-
ance, were £,86,835,900 "27; the oxprmhtmes,
^84,578,834 47; and the balance, $2,237,065 80.
Foi the first quarter of the current fiscal year,
commencing 1st July, 1861, the receipts and ex-
penditures aie ascertained, and for the remaining
three quaiters, ending 30th June, 1862, are esti-
mated as follows:

before midsummer. In that event, the provision
of revenue by taxation, which he has recom-
mended, will amply suffice for all financial exigen-
cies, without resort to additional loans; and not
only so, hut will enable the Government to begin
at once the reduction of the existing debt.
it is the part of wisdom, however, to be pre-
pared for all eventualities,and the Secretary there-
fore submits the estimates of the several Depart-
ments for the fiscal year, 1863, based on the
supposed continuance of the war, as follows:
The estimated expenditures are:
For the civil list, Including foruisn intercouise and miscel-
laneous expenses other than on account ot the public
debt    $23,088,071 23
Foi the Inteuor Depaitment, (Indians and

ituies of  475,331,245 51
On the other hand, the estimated
receipts are—
From custom-?,lands,and 01-
dniaiysouices $45,800,000 00
From direct tax  20,000,000 00

And leaving a balanccto be providedforof$379, >31.215 51
The whole amount required frfcm loans may,
therefore, be thus stated:
For the fiscal year 1862, tinder existing laws, ,$•75,449,075 00
For the fiscal year 1832, under laws to be
enacted  200,000,000 00
For the fiscal year 1833, alto under laws to

: j It is to be observed, however, that in the amount
; estimated for expenditures, $02,870,398 50 is es- ,,
, ti mated for public debt, payment of a considerable
part ol which will not probably be demanded, and ,
that some expenses are estimated for which may
■, be retreii' hod; so that the whole amount of loans ■,
required, in addition to the amount aheady au- 1
|| thouzed, will certainly not exceed $200,000,000. :
1 For the fiscal year 1863, commencing on the 1st
July, 1862,and ending on the 30th June, 1863, no !
; reliable estimates can be made. 11 is earnestly to 1
be hoped, and m the judgment of the Secretary,
" not without sufficient grounds, that the present
: war may be brought to an auspicious termination :
The total may be stated in round numbers at
$055,000,000.
A tabular statement will accompany this report,
showing somewhat more in detail the actual and
estimated receipts and expenditures of the finan-
cial years 1861, 1862, and 1863.
It only remains, m order to complete the view
of the financial situation, to submit a statement
ot the public debt as it was on the 1st days of July,
1860 and 1861, and will be, accoiding to the es-
timates now presented, at the same date in each
of the years 1862 and 1863.
The statement, in brief, is as follows:
On the Ux day of July, 1863. the public debt
  $64,769,703 08
On the 1ft da> ot July, 1801, tlie public debt
was--.  90,607,828 68
On the 1st day of July, 1852, the public debt
will be    5^7 370^30
On th" Kt day of July, 1833, the public debt '
willln-'  897,372,802 93
1 he particulars of which the debt consists, and
the portions which have been or will be paid or
contracted in each year, will appear fully m a
table, which will be submitted with this report to
Congress. Another table will be submitted, show-
ing the amount of the public debt in each year,
from 1701 to 1861, inclusive.
The Secretary, believing that the frankest is the
wisest policy for nations as well as individuals,
has thought it his duty to submit to Congress this
plain statement of the financial condition of the
countiy. 1 iiat it imposes considerable burdens
is not to be denied or disguised. It is consoling
to know that the energies and resources of the
people arc not insufficient for them. The public
debt on the 1st of July, 1863, if the war be pro-
tracted until that time, on the scale of expenses con-
templated by the estimates, will be, in round num-
bers, $900,000,000. The amount of the public
debt in the year 1816, was $127,334,933 74, and
m twenty years it was paid off by the people.
The country, even if the loyal States only are
regarded, can sustain and pay off in thirty years
the debt to which rebellion now exposes us, with
hardly greater proportional contributions from
