Third, how many new troops on your lines? Fourth, whether you have any regiments not attached to brigades? Fifth, whether you can spare with safety to your lines a brigade?

CHAS. J. PAINE,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 8, 1864.

Colonel PAINE:

I will answer your questions categorically when I have seen the division commanders that I have sent for. Does the general mean brigade of soldiers of 100-days' men?

W. T. H. BROOKS,Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS, July 8, 1864.

Colonel PAINE,

Aide-de-Camp:

We have 900 men on picket from the James to head of ravine, old troops; along the ravine 100 men, new troops; on the left of the ravine 400 new troops and 300 dismounted cavalry. There are no old troops to relieve these last. Not counting picket and artillery we have 2,484 old troops, 2,593 new troops to defend the works with. The Thirty-seventh New Jersey and dismounted cavalry are not brigaded. I suppose a brigade could possibly be spared, but I hope it will not be taken unless there is a great necessity, and, too, that its place is taken by colored troops.

(Sent 8 p. m.)

Brigadier General W. T. H. BROOKS,Commanding, &amp;c.:

The commanding general directs that your order a detail of 100 men to report to Captain Lyon at the pontoon bridge, Appomattox River, every morning at 6 o'clock until further orders. It would be desirable to order them from some other regiment, as the command at Spring Hill is so small that it cannot furnish the two details required in full.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, July 8, 1864-1.55 p. m.

General RAWLINS,General Grant's Headquarters:

Have some documents forwarded by me through General Butler's headquarters, with reference to the colored troops, been received at your headquarters?

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
