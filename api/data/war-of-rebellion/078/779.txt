HDQRS. WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI,Oxford, Miss., August 15, 1864.

Colonel DEAS, Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: I herewith inclose copy of orders from these headquarters relieving Lieutenant Colonel N. Wickliffe from duty with this command. Colonel W[ickliffe] was temporarily assigned to the command of this regiment by Lieutenant-Colonel Polk, who at the same time forwarded a letter recommending him to be promoted to colonel of cavalry, and that he be given the command of the above regiment, at that time without a field officer present for duty. The papers were returned to me with the indorsement that the appointment could not be made, and that Colonel George, although wounded a prisoner, was still the colonel of the regiment, and that other field positions must remain as per roster forwarded, or vacancies filled by promotion. Aside from this the regiment is much dissatisfied, have mutinied on one occasion, and it has done no good under his command. Colonel W[ickliffe] has repeatedly asked to be relieved, and I think the good of the service as well as the indorsement of the Secretary of war demands that he should be. I trust that Colonel W[ickliffe] may be assigned to a position more agreeable to himself and beneficial to the service than the one he held here.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. F. FORREST,

Major-General.
