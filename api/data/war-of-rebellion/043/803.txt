my command at Stafford Court-House without delay, to the commandant of the corps train, as guard to the same. On the evening of the same date, guarding the train, my command proceeded on the march, and reached Fairfax, Va., via Dumfries and Occoguan City, on the 14th of the same month. As this point I was relieved of further charge as guard to the train, and reported to you. After a halt until the 17th, I proceeded from this point with the brigade, under your command, to Leesburg, Va., arriving at the latter place on the 18th ultimo. Encamped at that point until the 20th, when, in accordance with your orders, I relieved the Twentieth Regiment Connecticut Volunteers, then on picket duty within 3 miles of said town, remaining there on picket duty until the 24th, when I was relieved by a regiment of your brigade, and immediately reported to you. Encamped with the brigade at the town of Leesburg until the 26th, when, under your command, commenced march, and proceeded to a point in the vicinity of Gettysburg, Pa., arriving there on the evening of the 1st instant, and encamping for the night. On the 2nd instant, marched to a position nearer the town and south of it, and to the right of the Gettysburg and Littlestown pike, and, by your orders, commenced making breastworks in great haste, which were completed in the afternoon of the same day, and I immediately guarded the same. On the same evening, under your command, I was called from the breastworks, and proceeded with other regiments of your brigade to a point near the left of the main line. After a short halt and several hours` absence from the breastworks, I retraced my steps with the intention of reoccupying my late position in the breastworks. When I approached the breastworks, found the enemy in possession of the same, and, in accordance with your orders, I took up a position in an open field on protecting ground near the breastworks, where I remained until the morning of the 3d, with the men concealed as much as possible from the bullets of the sharpshooters. At daybreak our artillery opened fire on the enemy, and several batteries in our rear, from an eminence, were obliged to throw their shot and shell immediately over my command, and from the premature explosions of our shells, and others from our batteries unexploded, falling in the midst of my command, I regret very much to record the following casualties. * During the day my command was much annoyed by sharpshooters, but I suffered no loss of life or injury in my command from the same. In the evening of the same (3rd instant), I took possession of my breastworks, and guarded the same until the 5th instant, when, together with the remainder of your command, I took up line of march, via Littlestown, Pa., Frederick City, Md., Crompton`s Gap, Williamsport, Sharpsburg, and Maryland Heights, to this camp, arriving on the 16th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. L. SELFRIDGE,

Colonel, Commanding Regiment.

Colonel A. L. McDougall,

Comdg. First Brig., First Div., Twelfth Army Corps.
