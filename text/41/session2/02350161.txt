The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.
Ho. of Beps.
1st of January we have already taken into the
Treasury $93,907,000, as against the corre-
sponding period of 1868 of $86,587,000, show-
ing a gain in six months only of $7,320,000,
and that, too, without the sugar importations
which come in the spring; that, too, without
the dry-goods importations, which largely come
in the spring to supply the fashions of the spring
and summer. So having gained thus much in
half a year, (over $7,000,000,) it is only fair
to presume that'the $185,000,000 estimated by
the Secretary of the Treasury must increase to
$190,000,000 ; nay, more, I think.
The internal revenue receipts of the country
are equally large. I have those returns, and
they show in corresponding months a gain of
$15,020,816, thus:
Revenue from July to December 31,1869...$83,750,976
Revenue from July to December 31, 18(38... 68,130,160
$15,020,816
And for the last month of February alone,
in addition to those six months of gain, there
is just reported to be an additional gain of
nearly $2,000,000 more. I infer from all
these facts without entering into further par-
ticulars, that the estimate of the Committee
of Ways and Means for the reduction of the
internal revenues of $30,000,000 on internal
taxes and $20,000,000 on the tariff (only
$50,000,000 in all) is altogether too small a
reduction. The reduction ought to be at least
$75,000,000, if not $100,000,000, under this
exhibit of facts, and the people ought to be
relieved right off from that taxation.
A TARIFFED MONARCHY—A TARIFFED REPUBLIC.
I have in my hand some books, and I wish
the House to look at them, for often theeyein
these matters is a far better teacher than any-
thing else. Here is the old British tariff, [Mr.
Brooks held up a large volume,] the big,
bouncing old book on which the British Gov-
ernment in former years imposed tariffs upon
the British people. Here is the United States
tariff, [Mr. Brooks held up Ogden's compila-
tion of our tariff,] upon which we now impose
duties upon our own people. It is not so big
a book as the old British tariff, but it is far too
big for Americans and far behind the progress
and civilization of the times. I hold in my
hands, and 1 want the pages of the House to
come and take them for distribution among
members, the presenttariff ofthe United King-
dom of Great Britain and Ireland, under which
over £21,600,000 of revenue are raised. [Here
Mr. Brooks handed the pages three or four
hundred little pamphlets, hardly an inch long
or wide.] This sum is raised only on nine or
ten articles. It is as follows:
Tariff of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland—with revenue, 1868-69.

Here are £21,600,000 sterling collected per
year in Great Britain on these 10 articles,
while our tariff shows that we impose duties
upon certainly 4,000—some count, 5,000 arti-
cles. While the British Government has come
down to 10 articles for the bulk of its revenue,
and in its " miscellaneous "—there are only 17
other articles—we still hold on to our 4,000 or
5,000 articles, in which respect, I am sorry
to say, we lag far behind the progress and civil-
ization of the age.
When Great Britain, at the close of her great
war in 1820, took a financial survey of her
affairs at home and abroad, she was in a posi-
tion very parallel with what ours now is. She
had passed through her exhaustive wars with
Napoleon as we have passed through our ex-
haustive civil war. In 1820, under a stimulus
from Alexander Baring, of American origin,
unlike ourselves, she began the reduction of
her tariff. There never was a country upon
the earth more ground down than Great Britain.
Few who have read Sidney Smith and other
eloquent writers or authors on British taxation
can fail to recall the terrible inflictions of this
British tax legislation.
BRITISH MONOPOLIES IN 1815 AND 1820.
Then existed the corn laws of 1815, which
continued until our day, and which the Free
Trade League of Cobden and Bright put down;
then existed the differential West India duties,
which discriminated for the protection of Brit-
ish West India products ; then existed the im-
mense East India monopoly, which controlled
the trade of over 100,000,000 of the people
of Asia; then were the navigation laws, not
only monopolizing the coastwise trade from
port to port, and the trade with the British
colonies, but keeping for England herself alone
the carrying of almost all the commerce of the
earth that came to her shores ; then was the
era of extravagant or prohibitory import du-
ties ; then were exports forbidden of not only
machinery, but of skillful workmen to work
that machinery, such skilled workmen as we
are now having and desire to have, but who
were then forbidden to leave England.
But then, too, great men sprung up and began
the destruction of that gigantic system of pro-
tectionandprohibition. Mr. Huskissonstepped
on the stage of action from 1822 to 182G. Sir
Robert Peel came to be at the head of affairs
about 1840-41, and began to modify the British
tariff. From 1846 to 1853 it was the whole
policy of the British statesman to have a rev-
enue tariff, and only a revenue tariff, as the best
tariff for the protection and advancement of the
commerce,trade, and industry of Great Britain
with the rest of the world. The reductions that
were made were enormous. I will state briefly
what they were, giving figures which will show
that the reduction of tariffs is not necessarily a
reduction of revenue, but that a reduction of
the tariff is often an increase of the revenue.
From 1821 to 1825 the reductions in the British
tariff were £4,500,000 sterling, while the loss to
the revenue was only £1,750,000 sterling. From
1825 to 1841 the reductions were £5,500,000,
while the loss to the revenue was only £1,500,000
sterling. From 1841 to 1853 the reductions
were £10,000,000 in all, while the loss to the
British revenue was only £1,000,000.
STRUGGLE OF WOOL AND WOOLENS.
Mr. Gladstone then came prominently upon
the stage and took an active part with Sir
RobertPeelin all measureswhichwereadopted
for reducing the British tariff, in order the bet-
ter to promote and protect British industry.
There was then a struggle in England like that
which is now going on between our wool man-
ufacturers and wool-growers in the United
States. There was a like struggle between the
English manufacturers and the English farm-
ers. The farmers of England naturally clam-
ored for a high protection on their wool,while
a high duty existed on all woolen articles of
British manufacture. Mr. Gladstone in his
speech, which any gentleman who is curious
on the subject will find in Hansard's Debates
in 1844. quotes the prices of wool, before and
after the abolition or reduction of the duty.
He shows that for three years the low duties
brought a higher price for wool to the farmer
than high duties. The southdown wool was
2s. a pound under the low duty; under the
high duty it was Is. 3Id. Kent wool, which
was Is. 5\d. under the low duty, was Is. Id.
under the high duty. Highland wool, which
was 2s. Id. under the low duty, was Is. 4§d.
under the high duty. These facts might have
shown us, if we had but read the story of the Brit-
ish struggle of wool and woolens, what would
have been the result in our own country of
a high tariff in a like struggle between the
wool-growers and the wool-manufacturers;
and they show now, once more, how little
there is under the sun of the really new, and
how great nations repeat errors like individ-
ual man.
In our high protective, or prohibitory tariff
on this article we look only at the surface of
things, forgetful of the great fact, that the man-
ufacturers of cloth need wool from all parts of
the earth—from Germany, from Australia,
from South Africa, as well as Buenos Ayres
and Montevideo, and that when they are lim-
ited to the one producing market of wool there
can bo little or no variety in these manufactures,
and, consequently, less of production and less
of demand even for our own American wool.
The European has open to him wool of every
fiber or texture; the American, only his own.
Hence, we have overstocked the market with
our own lines of production but left it free for
such as demand a finer, or a more varied, or,
in some cases, a cheaper article than our own.
We have nearly lost our commerce with South
Africa, Australia, and La Plata; and France
and England have taken it. To try to raise a
sheep, or an extra hide in Vermont or Michi-
gan, we have driven the white sails of our mer-
chantmen from those seas. The Argentine lie-
public, which, in 1864, sent us 21,111,406
pounds of wool, sent us but 8,173,000 pounds
in 1807, a reduction from 28,406,800 prior to
the adoption of our new tariffs. Under the
vain expectation that so high a tax as 14 cents
per pound on wool costing abroad but 14 cents
(100 per cent.) would raise the price of wool
in this country, and raise sheep too, we have
seen wool fall in price here and sheep slaugh-
tered here as never before.
The cold, green hills of Vermont could not
compete—God forbids it—with the plains of
La Plata or the savannas of Africa; and what
we have seen in England and in France and
in Belgium we see here now, high wool at
home under a low tariff and low wool under a
high tariff. While the price of Ohio wool be-
fore the high tariff of 1867 was from 54 to 51
cents a pound, it is now down to from 43 to 45
cents. And why is this ? It is because the
wool-raisers ofthe world have been unnaturally
driven from our markets to England, France,
Belgium, Germany, and have there glutted
those markets, with the millions of pounds we
once brought here in our ships, and there,
using and mixing the best adapted of the raw
materials to the textures they would work, the
softer and finer Buenos Ayres and German,
with the coarser or rougher wools of the world,
they have commanded the markets elsewhere,
and, insome degree, our own. What ourfarm-
ers were supposed to gain by a heavy prohib-
itory tariff upon their wools they have lost in
the reduced price of wool in Europe—a price so
reduced there as to underbid even the prohib-
itive protection we gave in 1807 to our woolen
manufacturers.
BRITISH TAXES 75" PER CENT.—AMERICAN 41.02.

cc-nta«e of revenue collected in 1809 from the
