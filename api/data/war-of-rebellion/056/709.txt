HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS, Chattanooga, Valley, November 18, 1863.

Colonel GEORGE W. BRENT,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I desire to know if I can rely on the railroad for supply of forage for my animals. I make this inquiry because it has been customary to send out our brigade and regimental wagons after forage, which ought to be discontinued if forage can be supplied by rail. We ought, if possible, to have our allowance of wagons on hand to be ready to move at any moment.

Very respectfully,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS, Near Chattanooga, November 18, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General Hardee directs that, through your inspector-general and other staff officers, you make yourself familiar with all the roads leading to the rear.

Respectfully,

W. D. PICKETT,

Major and Inspector-General.
HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS, [November 18, 1863]-4 p.m.

General STEVENSON:

Hold your command in readiness to move at a moment's notice.

W. J. HARDEE.
HEADQUARTERS, Powell's Trail, November 18, 1863-10 p.m.

Major REEVE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Late intelligence from nearly all of my pickets reports everything quiet.

A Federal force at Trenton variously estimated. Judging from the boldness of the movements of their advance, a heavy column is in supporting distance. From the best information I can get, this force moved up Sligo Valley from Whiteside's Station, on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, and crossed Raccoon Mountain at Squirreltown, near Trenton.

I send under guard to General Brown's headquarters a man in Yankee uniform, captured late this evening direct from the enemy, from whom you may learn something definite.

A squad of 15 or 20 Yankee cavalry seen opposite this position this morning on the Trenton and Chattanooga road.

I'll dispatch by the signal corps early to-morrow morning anything late, if the fog permits.

I am, major, very respectfully,

W. R. BUTLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Outpost.
