General FISK,

SAINT LOUIS, September 13, 1864.

General FISK:

The general commanding directs me to say in his opinion operations against the guerrillas in Howard, Boone, &amp;c., ought to be pushed with the utmost vigor; that there should be one controlling head for all the columns, and that head ought to be in such position as to communicate with all column commanders with the greatest rapidity. The general thinks it probable you can take the field with good effect. At any rate, please inform these headquarters if you cannot change your headquarters temporarily with beneficial effect upon present operations.
