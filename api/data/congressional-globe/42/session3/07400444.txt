THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 9,
Colorado is situated near the center of the conti-
nent. and is accessible from the east by the Union
Pacific, Kansas Pacific, and Atchison, Topeka and
Santa F£ railways. It has four hundred and ninety
miles of completed railroads, and over two hundred
in course of construction, and nearly all graded,
besides some five hundred miles projected, one half
of which will probably bo completed in the next two
years, thus making a total of about nine hundred
miles of railway, withiu a short period. There are
live railroads now running into the eity of Den-
\ er.
The census of 1S70 shows a population of 39,864,
but on account of the limited means and small com-
pensation for taking the same, as was the case in all
.-parsely settled localities, the returns show far less
than the population at the time. The number re-
turned in the county of Arapahoe, one of the most
populous in the Territory, was 6,829; while in Den-
^ er City alone, (situated in said county,) by a census
taken the following autumn, under the approval of
the city council, the population was shown to be
10,832. According to the best information that can be
obtained, and which the committee deems reliable,
there were, in the spring of 1S70, about60,000 people
it the Territory.
At that time there was no completed line of rail-
way there. Immigration, which always follows rail-
roads, has been very large during the last two years.
Six colonies have been located during that period,
and a degree of industry and prosperity has existed
unexampled since the settlement of California.
The assessed value of property taxed for the year
1869 appearing in the census returns was $13,147,114.
For the year 1872 it was $31,337,211 30. The mines,
not being taxed, are not included. The assessed val-
uation, including mines, would amount to about
860.000,000. The actual value would be much greater.
The committee has made such investigation as
leads it to believe that the present population of the
Territory is about one hundred thousand, and at the
present rate of increase it will reach the full num-
ber required for a Representative in the House
under the last apportionment law before the State
would be admitted under the operation of this bill.
Upon this estimate of ouo hundred thousand the
people of Colorado possess more than three times
the wealth per capita than did the people of any
Territory at the date of admission into the Union.
It does not seem probable that so many millions
of dollars would have been expended in the con-
struction of railroads in Colorado unless the business
and prospects of the country warranted. The rail-
ways discharged one hundred and sixty million
pounds of freight in the city of Denver in the year
1871.
The total amount of land sold, not computing any
grants, up to June 30,1872, is 944,996 acres, of which
341,&>5 acres have been entered as homesteads, or
2,132 homesteads of 160 acres each.
There are 157 post offices, 9 of which are presiden-
tial, and 9 others salaried at over $500 each. There
are 6 national banks, with a capital of 8575,000, be-
side private bankers. There are 19 towns, with
populations ranging from 1,000 to 15.000, with an
aggregate estimated at 45,500. There are many other
towns throughout the Territory, with populations
ranging from 100 upward. There are 27 newspapers
and periodicals, 9 being published daily.
Colorado has a voting population, as shown by the
registry law of the Terri'ory. of over 18,000* The
actual voting population is believed to be over 20,000.
The aggregate vote (or Delegate at the last election
was 13,856, the light vote being due to the fact that in
many localities the voters were fifty miles from the
nearest poll. The election also occurred in the midst
of harvest; yet this vote is as large as was east in
many congressional districts of the States for Repre-
sentatives to the Forty-Second Congress, where the
polls were very convenient.
In the three congressional districts of Vermont,
the average vote was 13,333; in the two congres-
sional districts of Rhode Island, the average vote
was6,165; in seven congressional districts in Ten-
nessee, the average vote was 13,795 ; in the ten con-
gressional districts of Massachusetts, the average
vote was 14,583; in the first, second, third, and ninth
districts of Missouri, the average vote was 13,675;
in Nevada, 13,312; in the first six districts of Ken-
tucky, the average vote was 13,658; and in many of
the other States the vote of congressional districts
is less than the vote of Colorado.
Although the present population of the Territory
is less than the ratio fixed by the last apportion-
ment law, it is believed it will have quite the requi-
site number before it would be admitted under the
terms of this bill. There are four States that have
not, according to the last census, a sufficient popu-
lation for one Representative ; and Congress has
allowed nine States one additional member each,
upon a less number than fixed by thegeneral appor-
tionment; and m four of these States there is a
Representative for less than a moiety, with a prob-
ability of a regular decrease during the decade-
Vermont, with a population of 330,551, having three
members—one member representing less than 60,000
people. The committee is of opinion that if the
older States, requiring less local or special legisla-
tion. are allowed members upon a less even than
one half the present ratio, the rapidly growing and
prosperous Territories should not be denied the
same rights, supported by stronger reasons, all
being claimed under the Constitution.
Population alone is not the proper or sole test for
the admission of new States. The present condition
rii<1 prospects of the immediate future of a proposed
State should be controlling considerations.
The following tables show the date of admission
of the several States named; the population of each.
according to census reports, made before and after
admission:
Tennessee admitted in 1796; population in 1790,
35,791; in 1800,105,602.
Ohio admitted in 1802; population in 1800, 45,365;
in 1810, 230,760.
Louisiana admitted in 1813; population in 1810,
76,556; in 1820, 153,407.
Indiana admitted in 1816; population in 1810,
24,520; in 1820, 147,178.
Mississippi admitted in 1817; population in 1810,
40,352; in 1820, 75,448.
Illinois admitted in 1818; population in 1810,
12,282; in 1820, 55,200. _
Missouri admitted in 1821; population in 1820,
66,586; in 1830, 140,455.
Arkansas admitted in 1836; population in 1830,
43,388; in 1840, 97,574.
Michigan admitted in 1837; population in 1830,
31,639; in 1840, 212,267.
Florida admitted in 1845; population in 1840,
54,477; in 1850, 87,445.
Wisconsin admitted in 1848; population in 1840,
30,945; in 1850, 305,391.
Iowa admitted in 1848; population in 1840, 43,112;
in 1850,192,214.
California admitted in 1850; population in 1850,
92,597.
Minnesota admitted in 1858; population in 1850,
6,077; in 1860,173,855.
Oregon admitted in 1859; population in 1850,
13.294; in 1860, 52,465,
Nevada admitted in 1864; population in 1860,6,857;
in 1870, 42,491.
Nebraska admitted in 1867; population in 1860.
28,841; in 1870, 122,993,
It will be seen that the States heretofore admit-
ted, or many of them, did not have the requsite pop-
ulation for a Representative; and but a small num-
ber of them possessed either the wealth or popula-
tion that Colorado now has. It will also be seen that
the increase in population has been muoh more
rapid under a State Jhan a territorial form of gov-
ernment. The committee can see no sound reason
why a new or different rule should be applied to
Territories now or hereafter seeking admission.
The basis for representation in the House of Rep-
resentatives is arbitrary. The number of members
must be increased from time to time or the basis of
representation must be enlarged. Can this arbitrary
ratio affect the ability of a Territory to maintain a
State government; or should it, by rigid application
in all cases, prevent citizens of the United States
from enjoying the benefits of a State government?
If this principle were strictly adhered to it would
seriously affect some of the oldest States; for it is
not improbable that at the end of this decade there
will be members upon this floor representing some
fifty thousand people; while some western members
will represent a half million, as is the case in the
present Congress. The rapid increase of population
might forever deny any Territory admission, pro-
vided Congress should not increase the number of
Representatives.
The annual products of Colorado have been closely
estimated for the year ending December 31, 1871.
The Rocky Mountain News places the amount at
$12,000,000, divided as follows; farm products.
63,500,000; mines, $5,200,000; wool, beef, hides, and
stook, $1,300,000; manufactures and improvements
within the Territory, $2,000,000. The estimated
amount for the last year will exceed $15,000,000.
During the year 1871, according to a census taken
by the city council, it appears that seven hundred
and seventy-eight buildings were erected in the eity
of Denver, at a cost of $2,301,375. During the last
year over eight hundred have been erected, and the
prosperity of the Territory has been general.
The case of Colorado is peculiar. In March, 1864,
Congress passed an enabling act similar to the bill
now pending, for the Territories of Nevada, Colo-
rado, and Nebraska. The former was admitted
under the bill, and the latter having complied with
all the essential requirements of the act except as to
time, was admitted in 1867. A few months after the
time specified in said enabling act, the people of
Colorado framed a constitution and State govern-
ment, and having complied with all the require-
ments of the act of March 21,1864, except as to time,
claimed admission. The bill passed both Houses of
Congress in 1866, and was vetoed by the President,
and not receiving a vote of two thirds it failed to
become a law. In 1867, the bill again passed both
Houses of Congress, and was again vetoed, and failed
as before.
In view of these facts, and having been invited
into the Union by the act of 1864, with a popula-
tion of less than one half it has at present, and
less than one third the wealth, with no railroads and
with much less internal improvements and perma-
nent industry, the committee believe that justice to
that people requires the passage of this bill.
The Territory has no debt, and, what is remark-
able, no levy of taxes was made for the last fiscal
year, and there is a large surplus in the treasury.
The bill for the admission of Colorado is in the
usual form and authorizes the people to elect dele-
gates to frame a constitution, provides for its sub-
mission, and, if ratified, the fact being certified by
the Governor to the President of the United States,
he is authorized to proclaim it a State of the Union.
MONTANA RAILROAD,
Mr. CLAGETT. Mr. Speaker, before this
bill is taken up for consideration I desire to
make a personal appeal to the House in be-
liulf of tin; Termor/ of Montana, which I have
the honor to represent on this floor. It is a
bill which unless passed at the present session
of Congress will result, in all human prob-
ability, to a considerable extent in the decrease
of our territorial population. It is a bill grant-
ing the right of way for the construction of a
railroad from the Union Pacific or the Cen-
tral Pacific in the southern part of Montana.
It makes no grant of land, and is absolutely
necessary in order that we may retain our
present population. We should at least have
some means for communication with the out-
side world. We are now paying on every
kind of freight coming into the Territory from
$120 to as high as $250 a ton. The expenses
attending our isolated condition are not only
detrimental to the interest of the Territory,
but ever thereafter, to a very large extent, the
depletion of our present population. I make
the appeal to the House that the bill to which
I refer, a bill (H. R. No. 2634) to incorporate
the Helena and Northern Utah Railroad Com-
pany and grant the same the right of way
through the public lauds, may be taken up
and passed pending the consideration of the
bill for the admission of the Territory of
Colorado.
Mr. COX. How can that be done?
The SPEAKER. It can only be done by
unanimous consent. Is there objection to
taking up the bill for consideration now?
Mr. CLAGETT. I hope there will be no
objection to receiving a report of the bill back
from the Committee on the Territories by the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Shoe-
maker] who has it in charge.
Mr. HOLMAN. Let the bill be read, and
we may then be better able to tell whether we
will object to it or not.
The bill, which was read in extenso, provides
in the first section that S. T. Hauser, John

shall be created and erected into, a body
corporate and politic, in deed and in law, by
the name, style, and title of the Helena and
Northern Utah Railroad Company, apd by that
name shall have perpetual succession, and shall
be able to sue and be sued, plead and be im-
pleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts
at law and in equity within the United States,
and may make and have a common seal. Said
corporation is authorized and empowered to
lay out, locate, construct, furnish, maintain,
and enjoy a continuous railroad and telegraph
line, with the appurtenances, namely, begin-
ning at Helena, in the Territory of Mon-
tana ; thence via the Three Forks, Madison
Valley, and Henry's L ke passes; thence by
the most practicable route to a connection
with the Union and Central Pacific railroads,
or with the Utah, Idaho, and Montana rail-
road ; and is vested with all the powers,
privileges, and immunities necessary to carry
into effect the purposes of this act as set
forth. The capital stock of the company
shall consist of fifty thousand shares of $100
each, which may be increased by said company
from lime to time to an amount sufficient to
