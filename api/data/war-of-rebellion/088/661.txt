Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1864-9 a.m.

It requires a great deal of work from my command, and I am not able to work any south of the fort at the Strong house. I think the Ninth Corps ought to throw their breast-work forward there to connect with the fort, as I am doing on the right of it. As it is now, the fort is some 200 yards in advance of the rifle-pit.

General S. WILLIAMS:

About 1,300 men were at work last night on the rifle-pit connecting the fort at the Strong house with Fort Crawford. The one at Strong house is a garrisoned and far enough advanced nearly for guns.

Major-General.
