WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, August 21, 1862.

Major-General WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

Governor Peirpoint telegraphs that the rebels are coming through Cheat Mountain Pass, and asks that you send three regiments to Grafton to re-enforce Colonel Harris. Can you do so?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

BALTIMORE, MD., August 21, 1862 - 7.10 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I have just received your dispatch of this date. I have not three regiments, not even one, to spare from any station this side of New Creek and Cumberland. Brigadier-General Kelley has three regiments besides Mulligan's battery at New Creek and Cumberland; in all, under his command in Western Virginia, over 5,000 men. I have just telegraphed him to use, if necessary, two of those regiments, leaving Mulligan's regiment and battery at New Creek.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

PARKERSBURG, August 21, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

My command going forward to Washington as fast as the railroad can furnish the transportation. The company does not seem to have had definite notice of the amount of transportation needed, and this causes a little delay here.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

(Copy furnished John W. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, by P. H. Watson, Assistant Secretary of War.)
