MILLEDGEVILLE, May 18, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

Do you make requisition on me for Colonel Gartrell's regiment and for the Savannah volunteer regiment in addition to the Sixth Regiment, which is to rendezvous in Atlanta 25th instant? If so, please state where you wish the two regiments mustered into service.

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

MONTGOMERY, May 18, 1861.

Governor JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville, ga.:

I make no requisition for Gartrell's regiment. My letter to him will disclose the circumstances under which it was agrees to be received. * Beyond this the matter rests with Colonel Gartrell and yourself. Nor do I make any requisition for the troops for Savannah. General Lawton can explain.

L. P. WALKER.

JACKSON, MISS., May 18, 1861.

President DAVIS:

Much injury to the service will result from ignoring the twelve-months' companies. They have camped and drilled at their own expense, and are now armed and are anxiously waiting orders by mail.

JOHN J. PETTUS.

MONTGOMERY, May 18, 1861.

Governor PETTUS,

Can you give me two regiments for twelve months, armed with heavy double-barreled shotguns?

L. P. WALKER.

L. P. WALKER:

Two regiments at Corinth have arms and ammunition. I think we can send you two regiments with double-barreled guns, and know I could send you five regiments armed with muskets and rifles in ten days.

JOHN J. PETTUS.
