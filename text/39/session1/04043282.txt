allowing such person at the rate of one day for each
twenty-five miles he maybe required to travel, com-
puting from the place of service to the place of

The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The word "fact," in
line seventy-four, should be in the plural,
" facts''
# ThePttESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pomeroy
in the chair.) That correction will be made.
The committee proposed further to amend
the clause, in line eighty, after the word " as-
sessor," to strike out "upon affidavit proving
the facts," and inline eighty-three, after the
word "resides," to strikeout " and such judge
or commissioner is hereby authorized and em-
powered to perform the duties herein required

or to answor interrogatories as required, it shall bo

ment will be made.
The committee proposed to strike out "duty

ment will be considered as agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The same words should
be stricken out in line one hundred and nine-
teen.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be
done.
The next amendment proposed by the com-
mittee was after the word " purposes." in line
one hundred and twenty-two, to strike out to
the end of the clause, the words stricken out
being:
And in addition to other provisions of law. when-
ever fraud has been or shall bo alleged as to any list
or return, and the party charged with fraud shall
make denial of the same in wiiting, and shall de-
mand a hearing thereon, and shall tender to tho as-
sessor of the proper district a bond with two or more
sureties payable to the United gtates in a sum not
less than double tho amount of the tax assessed be-
cause of such alleged fraud, and conditioned thatsuch
person will abide by the orders and judgments of the

pay whatever sum may be adjudged against him for
tax, and also all costs that may be adjudged against
him, and upon the approval of such bond by sueh

eases on the calendar of such court. And until final
judgment all proceedings by the assessor and col-
lector shall be suspended; and in ease of seizure of
property the property seized shall be released upon
the approval^ of the bond herein provided for; but
nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect
in any manner proceedings by indictment as provided
by law.
Mr. GRIMES. I would inquire why that
clause is stricken out.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The reason is that it
is an entire change of the law, and in the opin-
ion of the committee would send everything
for trial into the courts and cause continual
litigation.
Mr. GRIMES. If a man has got a good
defense and wants to go into court why not
allow him to do so ?
Mr. FESSENDEN. It is not a matter of
defense. This clause changes the whole sys-
tem, and would make it entirely different from
any other system anywhere in regard to the
collection of taxes.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Secretary read the next clause of the
ninth section, as follows :
That section nineteen be amended by striking out
all after tho enacting clause and inserting in lieu
thereof the following: that the assessor for each
collection district shall, by advertisement in the
newspaper of largest circulation in each county
within said district, and if there be none published
in any county of the district, then in the newspaper
of largest circulation in the collection district ad-
joining thereto, and by notifications to bo posted up
in at least four public places, and shall mail a copy
of such notice to each postmaster in his district, to
be posted up in his office, within each assessment dis-
trict, advertise, by not less than ton days' notice, all
persons concerned of the time and place within said
collection district when and where appeals will be
received and determined relative to any erroneous
or exccssivc valuations, assessments, or enumer-
ations by the assessor or assistant assessor returned
in tho annual list. And it shall be the duty of the
assessor for cach collection district, at the time fixed
for hearing such appeal, as aforesaid, to submit the
proceedings of the assessor and assistant assessor,
and the annual lists taken andreturned as aforesaid,
to the inspection of any and all persons who may
apply for that purpose. And such assessor is hereby
authorized at any time to hear and determine in a
summary way, according to law and right, upon any
and all appeals which may bo exhibited against tho
proceedings of the said assessor or assistant assessors,
and tho office or principal place of business of the said
assessor shall be open during the business hours of
each day, for the hearing of appeals by parties who
shall appear voluntarily before him: Provided, That'
no appeal shall be allowed to any party after he shall
have been duly assessed, and the annual list contain-
ing the assessment has been transmitted to the col-
lector of the district. And all appeals to the assess-
or, as aforesaid, shall be made in writing, and shall
specify the particularcause, matter, or thing respect-
ing which a decision is requested, and shall, more-
over, state the ground or principle of error com-
plained of. And the assessor shall have power to
reexamine and determine upon the assessments and
valuations and rectify tho same as shall appear just
and equitable: but such valuation, assessment, or
enumeration shall not be increased without a pre-
vious notice of at least five days to the party inter-
ested to appear and object to the same if ho judge
proper, which notice shall be in writing and left at
the dwelling-house, office, or place of business of the
party by such assessor, assistant assessor, or other
person, or sent by mail to the nearest or usual post
office address of said party: Provided further, That
on the hearing of appeals it shall be lawful for the
assessor to require by summons the attendance of
witnesses and the production of books of account in
the same manner and under tho same penalties as
are provided in cases of refusal or neglect to furnish
lists or returns. The costs for the attendance and
mileage of said witnesses shall be taxed by tho as-
sessor and paid by the delinquent parties, or by the
disbursing agent for the district, on certificate of the
assessor, at tho rates allowed to witnesses in the dis-
trict courts of the United States.
The Committee on Finance proposed to amend
this clause by inserting after the word "shall."
in lino one hundred and fifty-two, the words
"give notice," so that it will read, "that the
assessor for each collection district shall give
notice by advertisement."
The amendment was agreed to.
