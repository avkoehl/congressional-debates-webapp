HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 28, 1865-1865. (Received 12 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

Deserters from Hays' old brigade, now part of Gordon's division, Early's corps, report that the division moved from their camps near Hatcher's Run, north of Boydton plank road, on Wednesday night to Mahone's camp, and now occupy it, and that on their way they passed Mahone's division moving down the Boydton plank road toward Weldon. Upon close questioning I cannot find that they know positively of more than two brigades of Mahone's having passed them-Harris' and Finegan's. They say, however, that the men they met and called to said that all of Mahone's division had gone, or was then going.

A. A. HUMPRHEYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 28, 1865-11 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel BARTSOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The supply of wood within reasonable hauling distance is becoming deficient for part of my command. It has been suggested to connect the Norfolk railroad with our military railroad and obtain fire-wood for part of this command about one mile and a half down that road, where there is a large supply of excellent hard wood sufficient for fuel for the whole army. A few platform-cars, with armed cutting parties from each division, daily, or every other day or third day, would supply fuel more readily and with less hauling than it is now supplied.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,January 28, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel BARTSOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has transpired on the lines of this corps during the past twenty-four hours.

GEO. W. GETTY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
