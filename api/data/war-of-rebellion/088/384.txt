General HUMPHREYS:

The following has been received:

Captain CARATER,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The rebel movement reported to you continued about fifteen minutes, when our artillery opened on the and they at once in a covered way.

E. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Respectfully,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 21, 1864-12 m.

Major-General ORD,Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

General Mott holds the intrenchments from your left to the plank road, and your troops had probably better extend to the left. I will advise General Hancock at once, and that Mott should send some one to point out how your troops should best enter the trenches - but they are new to the intrenchments.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, August 21, 1864.

General GRANT:

I have ordered portions of my men to relieve Mott's division, by General Meade's order. My parapet front line in places does not cover my men, having been washed down by rain, hence there is danger of reducing too much my trench guard, having no reserves of either infantry of artillery. I should like two or three batteries from General Butler, Parke having withdrawn three batteries, and have none to replace them. I have no battery to prevent the enemy crossing near Fort Clifton.

E. O. C. ORD,Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

The enemy evidently intend to used nearly their entire force to drive us from the Weldon road. This will enable us either to penetrate their line or to hold with a small force. Either make an attempt to break through on your front, or extend so as to relieve Mott's division to go to Warren. I am inclined to think the latter to be the best policy, but leave it to your judgment.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
