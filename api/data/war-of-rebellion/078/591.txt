HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY,May 9, 1864.

[General CHALMERS:]

GENERAL: When General Forrest left he gave me a memorandum, which I handed in to the adjutant's office, which I presume they have overlooked and neglected. It was to this effect: As soon as the companies of Captains Forrest and Rodgers are mustered and organized send them on the expedition suggested.

Very respectfully,

C. W. ANDERSON,

Aide-de-Camp.

[MAY 9, 1864. -For Lee to Roddey, in reference to movement of Forrest into Middle Tennessee, &amp;c., see Vol. XXXVIII, part IV, p. 685.]

I wish you to be particularly active on the MISSISSIPPI River below Donaldsonville with your artillery and cavalry to co-operate with General Taylor, who is operating against Banks' demoralized army. I write you by mail.

Major-General, Commanding Department.

Demopolis, Ala., May 9, 1864.

Major General D. H. MAURY, Commanding, at Mobile, Ala.:

DEAR GENERAL: I assumed command of this department this morning, General Polk having left for Rome. I send you a copy of the order, as also two telegrams bearing on the subject from the President. I asked to be relieved from the command and that you be assigned, which was declined. I make this statement, general, that you may see that I thought of you and your rights, for nothing would cause me more unpleasantness than for you to entertain an unfavorable opinion of me or my acts. The President considers me independent. I will always be pleased to co-operate with you, and know you feel in the same way toward myself. I would much prefer having a command in active service, but soldiers must do as they are ordered. I received your note only yesterday with reference to your nephew, and will forward it to Vicksburg to be attended to. My regards to Mrs. Maury.

I am, general, yours, truly,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

DEMOPOLIS, ALA., May 9, 1864.

Brigadier General G. B. HODGE, Mobile, Ala.:

Forrest's cavalry is at Tupelo, Miss. ; Jackson's DIVISION between Montevallo and Rome. The general has left, taking West. I will send you all the rosters that arrive to Montgomery.
