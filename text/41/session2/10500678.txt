THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 22,
times more millions now lost annually to the
people by reason of the aggravated prices and
coats of production, resulting from the dishonest
laws enacted in the interests of the bounty-fed
monopolists.
The history of the last five years justifies no
hope that any of these great reforms will be
attempted by the Republican party leaders.
But it they are just, they should awaken the
profound interest of the people, and system-
atic agitation for reform should be everywhere
organized. Popular indifference to the con-
duct of public affairs has become of late one
of the most alarming and disheartening char-
acteristics of the times. Their apathy seems
to be so great that nothing can arouse them.
No crimes against the Constitution or civil
liberty; no official indecencies or corruption ;
no class legislation; no dishonest and delusive
system of taxation, move them from their in-
difference. If this condition of popular feeling
shall continue much longer it will fully justify
the conduct of the present rulers. It will prove
that the Representatives fitly express and illus-
trate the moral sense of the country, and that
the poison of general corruption has stricken
to the very heart of the Republic.
Let us never cease to remember that how-
ever bad or reckless or unfaithful the Gov-
ernment becomes it still is our Government,
and the duty to agitate and struggle for reform
only becomes the more imperative. The brave
man and good citizen will never confess that
all is lost and reform impossible, but will fight
on within his sphere and according to his abil-
ity while life lasts. Good civil government,
and especially self-government, requires un-
ceasing vigilance, earnest efforts, and virtuous
intelligence in the citizens. If these exist and
are manifested, the public servants will not
dare so openly and persistently to neglect their
duty. I trust the great masses of the country
will in the future act in this spirit, and more
beneficent results will speedily follow.
When these reforms are made or when they
are in good faith commenced we may hope to
approach specie payments successfully and
safely, but not sooner. We cannot do it now
nor hastily without a violent shock to all busi-
ness interests, and a resulting necessity for
immediate return to an inconvertible and irre-
deemable currency, doing infinite injury in the
attempt. The needful amount of gold is not
in the country. Under existing laws and
policy, to which I have already referred, it
cannot be induced to come here. The natural
laws of trade operating upon our foolish and
abnormal condition will attract it elsewhere.
Ours is a gold-producing country, and yet for
many years more gold has annually been ex-
ported than is produced. For seven years
past we have exported annually over sixty-one
million dollars more than we have imported.
The average annual product of the precious
metals in the United States during the last
fifteen years does not exceed $50,000,000.
For many years past very little of it has found
its way into the general circulation. It has
been hoarded, exported, or converted to other
uses than that of a circulating medium. When
we have returned to a rational and honest
public policy this condition will cease. If
there were added to our $700,000,000 of paper
currency to-day another $700,000,000 in gold,
I doubt very much whether specie payments
could be restored and maintained for six
months. Itis a law of finance that an inferior
will always drive out of circulation a superior
currency, and that a vast foreign commerce
which does not substantially consist in the
exchange of product for product other than
the product of the precious metals, but leaves
a balance or deficit which greatly exceeds the
latter product and must be paid in gold, will
always drain the supply of gold and silver cur-
rency in any country against which such a bal-
ance exists, and leave in it the vicious currency
alone or chiefly; and this is the condition of
the United,States to-day. Gold would still be
worth more than paper, because it would find
an immediate demand abroad which paper
never has. It is the currency of interna-
tional commerce and of civilization. It would
instantly become an article of export, and by
the irresistible laws of trade it would speedily
leave our country and leave us substantially
where we are to-day. Before we can hope to
bring it here and induce it to remain we must
reestablish our commerce, change the gold-ex-
hausting balance of trade, be able to exchange
product for product, notgold for products, until
after our equilibrium of the precious metals is
reestablished and our foreign commerce re-
stored. These results can only be approached
gradually and secured after the lapse of con-
siderable time, but they are all attainable and
supremely desirable.
Mr. Speaker, the mere financial policy of the
present Administration, so far as it is intelli-
gible to the public, is fatally defective and un-
just. It ignores the necessity for the reforms
to which I have referred. It refuses to com-
prehend the general situation and to appreciate
what it demands. It is empirical and illogical.
No financial policy that does not contemplate
these reforms can ever be permanently suc-
cessful or give enduring prosperity to the
country. They lie at tho very foundation of
all true policy.
The proposition of the Administration to con-
tract the currency certainly promises no relief
in this time of general financial stringency and
emergency. The volume of the currency, now
about eight hundred and thirty two million
dollars, nearly twice as much as it ever was
before the war, is very large. But the onerous,
unequal, and dishonest systems of taxation and
banking tend so greatly to foster monopolies,
speculation, and illegitimate ventures, and to
concentrate vast sums in the hands of a few,
and in a few great commercial and financial
centers, that it is matter of profound doubt
whether the general welfare of the country does
not demand further increase of the currency in
addition to the increase that would result from
the proposed change in the banking system. I
believe many interests would be benefited by
a moderate additional increase.
The experience of the world has not determ-
ined and no financier can pronounce ex cathe-
dra how much currency is needed to conduct
prosperously the exchanges of any country, or
what should be the precise relation in amount
between its paper and specie currencies. The
country most demands rest from too exhaustive
contributions to the Government, reduced tax-
ation, and especially in the indirect, covert,
iniquitous, and enormous impositions of our
internal revenue and tariff laws, and time to
recuperate its overburdened and languish-
ing productive energies. This recuperation,
with the rapid increase of the population, in-
dustry, and commerce of the country will do
more thau the wisdom of Congress otherwise
directed to solve the difficult financial prob-
lems of to-day.
As the excessive burden of taxation involves
a direct addition to the cost of production and
to genera! prices, so any material reduction of
such burdens will reduce the cost of produc-
tion, lower prices, increase the purchasing
power of money, and thus practically augment
the sufficiency and power of the volume of the
currency in existence at the time. The aggre-
gate of tho currency of this country has never
in our past history been maintained for any
long period of time at a uniform sum. Under
our more or less defective and vicious systems
of banking and currency-making before the
war it was in a constant process of change,
either toward inflation or contraction, and
the country had many expensive and bitter
experiences of the folly of such financial
policy.
The following table, compiled with care from
the best attainable sources, will be suggestive to
reflecting minds in connection with our finan'
cial history:

The present Administration is using the ex-
cess of the public revenues in the purchase of
gold interest-bearing bonds. These purchases,
so far as they were made with currency, cost
the people on an average sixteen per cent, above
the face of the bonds. The January (1870)
statement of the public debt claims a decreasein
the debt since March 1,1869, of $76,716,306 70.
If $75,000,000 of that sum is the result of pur-
chases of bonds with currency it has cost the
people $12,000,000 inpremium or bonus to the
bondholders. Is that rig;ht ? If required by
the law and the contract it is right. But the
bonds purchased are not of the " ten-forties,"
which are payable expressly in gold, and might
therefore command a premium in currency.
They are the " five-twenties," which are not
expressly payable in gold, and in my judgment
are, upon a fair and legal construction of the
law and the contract, payable only in whatever
at the time of payment is the common currency
of the country. That currency is not gold, for
Republican statesmanship has demonetized
gold and made it a mere article of Commerce,
and driven it from the sight of the people.
These bonds are due and payable at any time
at the option of the Government. Their pur-
chase is, therefore, a great wrong, a perver-
sion, misapplication, and waste of the people's
money; an unjust discrimination in favor of
the bondholder, who will be well paid when he
receives the face of his bond in the currency
with which the people conduct their business
and with which he originally purchased it.
Such business ought, therefore, to be instantly
stopped and forbidden by law. Indeed, it has
been done without authority of law, and merits
instant rebuke, if not punishment.
The bill lately introduced by the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Ingersoll] and referred to
the Committee on Banking and Currency is
directly violative of this principle, and is there-
fore wrong, and ought not to become a law.
The bill provides as follows:
Section 1. That the Secretary of the Treasury, in
addition to the United States legal-tender notes here-
tofore issued under former acts of Congress, bo, and
hie is hereby, authorized and directed to issue like
notes of the denominations heretofore issued, and
in such proportions as he may deem best, to tho
amount of S44,000,000. Ten millions of said notes to
be issued within thirty days after the passage of this
act, and $10,000,000 within sixty days after the pas-
