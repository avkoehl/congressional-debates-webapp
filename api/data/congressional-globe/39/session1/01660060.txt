THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 14,
Now, sir, if we intend to enter upon a system
of retrenchment, let us begin at the very start.
Here is a document, the interest and impor-
tance of which I am -willing to acknowledge;
trat by consenting to print so large a number
as has been proposed, which is five times the
number of copies of any similar document ever
printed by the House, we should inaugurate a
precedent which, I know, would be urged with
power and effect, not only upon the committee,
but upon the House, during the whole session.
In some way we must economize in our expend-
itures for public printing. This resolution,
even in the shape submitted by the committee,
provides for an expenditure one hundred per
cent, greater than former expenditures in sim-
ilar cases. We have this document without
covers, because covers cost three cents apiece.
Now, I submit to the House whether, with this
state of facts, it becomes us in this early period
of the session to inaugurate a system which, if
carried out to the end of the session, will
increase our public printing from $1,500,000
to over $3,000,000. I demand the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered.
Mr. VASHBU11NE, of Illinois. Does not
the gentleman yield for the purpose of allowing
mo to submit my amendment?
Mr. LAFLIN. I decline to yield for that
purpose.
The resolution was adopted.
Mr. SPALDING- moved to reconsider the
vote by which the resolution was adopted; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed lo.
CLERK TO A CO-M-MlT'OilB.
Mr. ELIOT, fr<5m the select committee on
freedmen. reported the following resolution,
on which he demanded the previous question:
R'yyUxrd, That the sclect committee on freeduien
be authorized to employ a clerk at the usual com-
pensation.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the resolution was adopted.
WAH DEBTS Of LOYAL STATES.
Mr. BLAINE, from the sclcct committee on
the H-ar debts of the loyal States, reported the
following resolution, on which he demanded
the previous question:
Unsolved, That the select committeo on the war
debts of tho loyal St,lies he aMov, e<! to osnnlov a
clerk durinsr the present session, or until he is dis-
charged, at tho usual compensation.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the resolution was adopted.
Mr. IJLAIA'ii. Mr. Speaker, with tho con-
sent of the House, I desire to mak« a statement.
There was a little confusion in regard to the
number which should compose that committee,
between the gentlemen from Iowa, [Mr. Yv'i:.-
hox,] and the gentleman from illinuis, [Mr.
TVashi'suuxl.] It was m\ ini.eui.iou to luive
yielded to the number of nine, ami not to the
number of twenty-three. I think ihat the vari-
ous interests involved in the matter would he
fully answered and belter sitib fieri if, b; unani-
mous consent of the Houce, the Speaker wore
allowed to add two members to that comjiiittee.
Mr. WASIIBlIiiN E, of Illinois. Vvithsueh
an excellent committee as it is, I think it is
quite !'">'■ enough.
Mr. BJuAINE. I move to add two members
to it.
Mr. TVASHBL RNE, of Illinois, objected,
but afterward withdrew his objection.
The motion wa.-> agreed to.
I he SPblAKEL-t ptoeeed-vd tocnlitho States
aim Territories for bills and rrsolutions.
COURTS IX WASHINGTON TERMTOnY.
Mr. DENNY introduced a bill in relation
to the courts in V,udiington Territory,* which
was read a li"?l and .second time.
Mr. !' 'n a V" asked that the bill be put on
its passage.
to move the reference of the bill to the Com-
mittee. on the Judiciary. This subject has been
considered during the last two Congresses, and
there has been much cotilli ct of views in regard
to it. I make that motion.
Mr. DENNY. I have no objection to a
reference of the bill to the Committee on the
Judiciary, if that be deemed the best way to
accomplish the objeet I have in view. The sub-
ject is one of great importance to my constitu-
ents, and if it be referred to that committee, I
hope that it will be reported back as expedi-
tiously as possible.
Mr. WILSON. There is no provision in the
bill for any notice being given of tho times and
plnces of holding courts in that Territory. That
of itself should send the bill to that committee
to be properly amended.
Mr. DENNY. I ask that the committee
have leave to report at any time.
There being no objection it was so ordered.
The bill was then referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary.

of the same import; which v. as read a first and
second time, referred to the Committee on the
Pacific Railroad, and ordered to be piinted.
EQUALIZATION OF COUNT1HS,
_ Mr. CLARKE, of Kansas, also introduced a
bill to equalize bounties to soldiers of the Army
of the United States during the rebellion: which
was read a first and second time, and referred
to the Committee on Military All'airs.

navs.
