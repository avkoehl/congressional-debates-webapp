that division commanders should take precautions against a surprise on that day. Pickets should be kept well to the front, patrols frequent, supports and reserves prepared. Troops ready without being disturbed.

Colonel MARCY:

The dispatch of the commanding general received at 4.30 p. m. All measures taken to execute his orders. Report from Sandy Hook states that rebels have put forty or fifty boats in the Shenandoah at Snickersville, said to be for falling back from Winchester if necessary, but they can be used either way. We have just received full report of movemnts of enemy by letter up to very recent date which I believe correctly states his present position. Will forward abstract immediately.

Major-General, Commanding Division.

General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

Our force will be in Virginia Tuesday morning. No contest will be made except at Winchester, in my belief, and we shall fall back upon the plan suggested by the general commanding. For this we are weak. Cannot the additional brigade regular cavalry and artillery join us at Harper's Ferry? Without tents we shall be driven to rapid movements and hard work. There was never greater opportunity to accomplish his designs.

Very respectfully,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding Division.
