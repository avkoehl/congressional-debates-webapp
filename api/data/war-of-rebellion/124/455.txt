and colored troops to diseases of malarious origin, which is both of importance and interest.

In the Department of the Gulf white and colored troops and serving together, subject to the same miasmatic influences and performing the same duties. According to the report of Medical Inspector Townshend the proportion of white soldiers affected with malarious diseases, such as remittent, intermittent, and typhoid fever, diarrhea, dysentery,m neuralgia, chronic rheumatism, &amp;c., is 10.8 per cent., whilst the colored soldiers are only so affected to the extent of 0.8 of 1 per cent. In round numbers, therefore, eleven white soldiers suffer from this class of diseases to one negro.

This result was not unexpected. The experience of the British Government through a series of years has been to the same effect, as is seem from the following table, in which the rations of mortality among the white and negro troops serving in the armies of Great Britain are given:

English.	 Negroes.

Jamaica................................	 101.9	 8.2

Bahamas................................	 159.0	 5.6

Honduras...............................	 81.0	 4.4

Sierra Leone...........................	 410.0	 2.4

Mauritius..............................	 1.7	 0.0

Ceylon..................................	 24.6	 1.1

The advantages are thus proven to be altogether with the colored troops, who are shown to be far more capable of resisting the morbid influences of malaria than white men similarly situated.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
