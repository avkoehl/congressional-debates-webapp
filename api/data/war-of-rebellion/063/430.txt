Commanding, &amp;c.;

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that the enemy is not supposed to be over 400 or 500 strong at Wilson's and Smith's farms, where you have been directed to land and drive the enemy away, on your way down the river. They are supported by grain, &c., stored in the neighborhood. So much of this as you are not able to take away with you will destroy.

Very respectfully, &c.,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, May 4, 1864.

Major General J. A. McCLERNAND,

Commanding Thirteenth Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that at 6 a.m. to-morrow you feel the enemy in your front strongly, by advancing at least 2,000 infantry, supported by such force as you may deem necessary. You will, if possible, drive the enemy back to Graham's plantation. This movement is in connection with other movements. You can move against the enemy with confidence and firmness, for he is not in great force in your front. It is expected you will be prompt.

Very respectfully, I am, general, your obedient servant,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
