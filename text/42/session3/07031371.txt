Mr. PRATT. The Committee, on Claims,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 3315)
for the relief of Henry Goldhammer, have had
the same under consideration and directed me
to report it back without amendment and rec-
ommend its passage. As this is a small bill,
and a very meritorious oue, providing that the
Secretary of the Treasury shall issue a dupli-
cate draft for eighty dollars in lieu of one that
has been lost, 1 ask that the bill be now put
on its passage.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It directs the Secretary of the
Treasury to issue a duplicate check to Henry
Goldhammer for the sum of eighty dollars, in
lieu of a lost original check for that sum issued
by W. M. Fleming,.assistant paymaster of the
United States, at Atlanta, Georgia, on the 7th
of November, 1864, upon satisfactory evidence
of the loss of the original check, and upon the
execution and delivery by Goldhammer of such
bond, with sureties, to indemnify the United
Slates, as is provided by an act to authorize
the payment of duplicate checks of disbursing
officers, approved February 2, 1872.

The motion was agreed to.

imous consent obtained, leave to introduce a

The motion was agreed to.

the calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The morning
business having concluded, the residue of the
morning hour will be devoted to the consid-
eration of bills on the Calendar under the
Anthony rule.
Mr. FENTON. I ask the Senate to con-
sider a bill which was passed over the other
day on the Calendar. The bill and report
have been read. The bill is very short, and
if there is any objection after reading the bill
i will not further trespass on the Senate. _
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. I must insist
on the regular order, in justice to the business
of the committees on the Calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Connecticut insists on the regular order.
the pension laws.
Mr. PRATT. The Senator from Ohio
nearest me [Mr. Sherman] yesterday en-
tered a motion for the reconsideration of the
bill (H. R. No. 2312) to revise, consolidate,
and amend the laws relating to pensions. I
should be glad if that motion could be taken
up now. There-are one or two amendments
that occur to him and to myself as necessary
to be made.
Mr. SHERMAN. I trust that will be done.
I have no opposition to the bill; I only desire
to perfect it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Indiana proposes that (he-Calendar under
the Anthony rule be informally passed over in
order to reconsider the vote by which the pen-
sion bill was passed, and also to reconsider
the vote on the third reading of that bill, to
admit of some amendments. The Calendar
will be passed over, subject to objection if this
bill should give rise to debate, as the Senator
from Connecticut has insisted on going on
with the Calendar.
Mr. PRATT. The Senator from Connec-
ticut withdraws his objection so far as this bill
is concerned.
The votes on the passage and third reading
of the bill were reconsidered.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill is now
open to amendment.
Mr. PRATT. The first amendment is in the
thirty-seventh section, last clause, reading as
follows:
And from and after the 1st day of July next, the
salary of the Commissioner of Pensions shall be
$4,000.
When 1 was asked yesterday whether the
committee had recommended any increase of
salaries, I supposed that this was among the
amendments recommended by the committee,
but I find that it is a part of the House bill.
I think it was the intention of the Senate yes-
terday that there should be no inciease of sala-
ries. The Senator from Ohio informs me that
provision is made for the increase of the sala-
ries of certain officers in an appropriation bill
that is now pending between the two Houses.
Therefore, in order to carry out what was the
understanding of the Senate yesterday, I move
as an amendment to the House bill that this
last clause be stricken but, namely:
And from and after the 1st day of July next, the
salary rf the Commissioner of Pensions shall be
$4,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. DAVIS. I ask the Senator from Indiana
does that include all the salaries that were yes-
terday proposed to be increased ? There were
several yesterday, as I understood.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
to increase the other salaries was withdrawn
by consent of the Senate.
Mr. PRATT. The next amendment that I
propose is in thethirty-first section as itisnum-
bered in the Senate bill. There was a substi-
tute for that section, on my motion, adopted
yesterday. My attention this morning is called
by the Commissioner of Pensions to a verbal
omission in that substitute. _ 1 wish now to
propose as an amendment to it the words "or
for bounty land than is hereinbefore provided."
I ask to have the substitute so amended as to
read:
And any agent or attorney or any other person
instrumental in prosecuting any claiui for pension or
bounty land who shall, directly or indirectly, con-
tract, demand, receive, or retain any greater com-
pensation for his services or instrumentality in pros-
ecuting a claim for pension or for buuab landtham-s
hereinbefore provided," &c.
That is the amendment I propose.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. PRATT. Now I ask that the bill be
put on its passage.
The amendments were ordered to be en-
grossed, and the bill to be read a third time.
The bill was read the third time, and passed.
acceptance op president-elect.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate re-
turns to the consideration of the bills on the
Calendar under the Anthony rule.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to make & re-
port in the nature of a privileged report. The
committee of the two Houses appointed to
