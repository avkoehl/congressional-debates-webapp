[Indorsement Numbers 1.]
HDQRS. CAV. DIV., ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,February 28, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded.

This reconnaissance was ordered by telegraph on the evening of the 23rd instant. With that brief notice, General Lee started early next morning from Culpeper. The commanding general is aware of the extraordinary obstacles and difficulties in the way of success-a swollen river, snow, mud, rain, and impracticable roads, together with distance.

The brief report shows how skillfully it was executed and how successfully it was terminated.

Special attention is called to the commendation of the officers and men mentioned, to which I desire to add my high appreciation of the ability and gallantry displayed by Brigadier-General Lee in his prompt performance of the important duty assigned him.

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General, Commanding.
