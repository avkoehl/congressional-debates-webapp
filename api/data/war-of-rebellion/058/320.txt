force in the front. From all we can learn Longstreet has no intention to assume the offensive at present. The force which attacked Colonel Love is probably a portion of Jones' command.

If you should be attacked at the gap, the commanding general expects you to hold out to the last.

While Colonel Strickland is engaged in repairing the road at Wheeler's Gap, he will report to General Ammen, whose command includes that district.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff.

Brigadier-General POTTER,

Chief of Staff, Knoxville (via Chattanooga):

Yesterday morning a company of the Forty-fifth Kentucky captured a party of 5 guerrillas in the act of handing a Union man near Mount Sterling. The man was hanging to a tree at the time the party was captured. Can I have the guerrillas tried by a military commission, and if found guilty at once executed?
