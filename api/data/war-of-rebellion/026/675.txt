men; one North Carolina company of about 20 men; two armed schooners, with 26 men each, and about 100 negroes as laborers.

March 12 I sent a party of soldiers from the North Carolina company into the woods for wood with 12 negroes. After being there a short time they were attacked by about 40 guerrillas and 1 negro killed and 2 wounded and 3 of the soldiers taken and carried away prisoners. Soon as the alarm was given I sent a company in pursuit, but they having taken up the bridge were not overtaken by our forces.

I have kept the negroes employed lately in throwing up an intrenchment and have it nearly finished. I shall then send those that are not needed here to New Berne.

Nothing more occurred until the 6th of April. Captain Sanders, of the North Carolina company, with a detail of 7 soldiers and 10 negroes, was sent down the river in a schooner after wood; the wind blowing, they were not able to land that day; he returned home and left the men on board; in the evening they went on shore to see their families, and were all taken and carried away to Richmond prisoners, leaving that company now with only 14 men for duty. Had we a company of cavalry here I think we might rid this section of the country from the guerrillas. As it is now, unless we go out in a large force, we are liable to be picked off. We have now six horses and one yoke of oxen, enough to do our teaming. Previous to your last instructions, under General Palmer's order I had returned to the persons taken from 10 horses and 13 mules, and have given receipts for the rest.

We have received no rations since I arrived here, although I have sent two requisitions, and I have been obliged to forage upon the citizens, and if the Government is to pay for them it will be much more expensive than if sent from New Berne, as provisions are scarce and high.

The negroes are very much in need of clothing, not having received any pay or clothing from the Government and have been employed seven months.

Yours, respectfully,

J. W. WALLIS,

Major, Commanding Post, Elizabeth City, N. C.
