HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,Fort Leavenworth, January 10, 1865.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Commanding District of Upper Arkansas:

COLONEL: You will see by the newspapers the Indians have moved against the posts on the Platte and been repulsed. I am informed that the Indians moved south. No doubt they are between the Platte and Arkansas in large numbers. I have sent the Eleventh Kansas forward to Riley, and hope you will get everything ready for field operations at an early period. Meantime have all the posts notified to keep themselves in readiness to resist an Indian assault, as the orders driven from the Platte may return toward the Arkansas. I note what you say in your letter of the 3rd as to a post near lake Sibley. This cannot be done at present, as I want the troops held at the present posts ready for the field when fully equipped. I hope, too, you will not be long absent from your headquarters, when I want you to give directions to preparing matters for every probable necessity. Have troops inspected and see that everything is ready. Horses must be shod, and extra shoes in pockets; also men must be in good trim, guns in good order and plenty of ammunition. Artillery for field service must also be examined, and especially as to horses, harness, and ammunition. Keep scouts in the field, but do not send out needless expeditions to break down our stock, which I hope to have ready for a larger and more thorough operations against the foe. Let me know everything that is going in.

Truly, yours,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General MITCHELL, Fort Kearny:

I would not take troops far from Overland route. Weather too bad, and Indians probably gone too far. Am trying to get more troops for stronger movements.
