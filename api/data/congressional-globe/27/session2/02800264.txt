wHispsredaught against his integrity and his virtue To the
lasth*cominuedto "fishtthe good fight," and to "keep that
faith" which is based on the true principles of liberty and an
unwavering devotion to the free institutions of his country
llet mefiot be misunderstood  I have no allusion to party
No matter ¿ow others may be affected, his^co!leagues know
how t« appreciate his ¡oss How often, m the hour of difh
culy, have we consulted* hia sound practical wisdom arid tried
integrity' He stood, as it weie, ar impersonation of the cha
ractewof the "Old North State," whose interests he represented
Boiauhfully, and which he loved so well—combining energy
with calmness, patriotism and virtue with ufipietendiug sim-
plicity Although hie ears will no more listen to the murmur
ing of waters from her western mountains, although his eyes
will no more be gladdened with the view of his dear native
hills, yet his memory will Uve in the hearts oí his confiding
constituents, and be handed down with reverence to their sue
ceedmg children
Although we mourn his loss, yet we have the consolation to
know, that he died in "the triumphs of that faith" to whose
precepts he conformed m life At an early age he attached
himself to the Presbyterian church, and eontmued an exem
piary member of the same down to the period of hia death
He never suffered public duty or private pleasure to interfere
with the disc, harge of thos** dunes which he owed to his God
To hi!|latest breath he looked with humble and calm resigra

living, and whom he "confps&ed before men" Those of us
Who witnessed his last moments, have had read to us the ím
piessive and never to be forgotten lesson, with what quiet com
posure a Christian can die. He has left this world foiever, but

Mr Raynsr then sent to the clerk's table the following reso
hmoiis
Resolved That the House has heard with the liveliest sensi
mliiy the annunciation of the death of the Hon LEWIS
WILLIAMS, Jaie a member from the State of North Carolina,
and the oldest member in service m this House,
Resolved) That this House tenders to the relatives of the de-

and as a testimony of respect for the memory of the deceased,
the members and officers will wear ctape on the left arm for

Resolved, That the members and officers of this House
will attend the funeral of the Hon Lewis Williams de
ceased, I ite a member of this house, to morrow, at 12 o'clock
meridian
Resolved That a committee be appointed to take order for
super¡titending the funeral of the dec* ased
The resolutions having heen read-
Mr ADAMS rose and said Mr 'Speaker, I second the mo
tion, and ask the indulgence oí the House for the utterance of a
few woids, (rom i heart full to overflowing with anguish which
no words can expíese
Sir, my acquaintance with Mr Williams commenced with
the second Congress oí his service in this House Twenty five
yeais have since elapsed, during all which he has heen alwajs
here at his post, always true to lus trust, alwaya adhering faun
fully to*his constituents and to his country—always, and through
every political vicrwsiiude and revolution, adhered to faithfully
by them I have often thought that this steadfastness of mutual
attachment between the Representative and the Constituent was
characteristic of both, and, concurring with the idea just ex
pressed with such touching eloquence by his colleague, (Mr
Ravnsr,) I have habitually looked upon Lewis Williams a*
the true portiaitureand personification of the people of North
Carolina
Sir, the lo'-is of such a man, at any time, to his county, would
begreat To this House, atthnjuncture it ísirrepaiable His
wisdom, his experience, his unsullied integrity, his irdent pa-
triotism, his cool and delibmte judgment, his conciliatory tem-
per, his firm adherence to principio—where shall we find a su b
sfitute for tfiemí in the distracted state of our public counsels,
with the wormwood and the gall of personal animosities adding
tenfold bitterness to the conflict of uval interests and discoidant
opinions, how shall we have to deplore the bereavement of Ms
presence, the very light of whose countenance the veiy sound
of whose voice, could recall us, like a talisman, from the tem
pest of hostile passions to the calm composuie of harmony and
peace
Mr Williams was and had long been, in the official Ian
guage which we have adopted from thti British f louse of Com
mons, the Father of the House, and though my lumorby near
ly twenty years, I have looked up to him, m this House, with
the reverence of filial affection, as if he was the father of us all
The seriousness a d gravity of his character, tempered as  it
was with habitual rheei fulness and equanimity peculiarly fit
ted him for that relati m to the othei   membeis of the House,
while the unassuming courtesy of his depoitment and the he
nevolence ofhia disposition invited eveiy one t > consider him
as a brother
Sir, he is gone' The places that have known him shall know
himno more but his memory sha'l he tieabiirel up by the
wise and the good of Ins contemporaries, as eminent among the
patriots and statesmen of this our native land andweit it ,ios
«¡iblc for ai y ¡Sou íern bosom, within this hill, evei to hi bor
for one moment a wi^ for the dissolution of our National
Union, may thespint of our departed inend, pervading eveiy
particle of the atmosphere around us, dispel the delusion 01 his
soul by reminding him tha m that event he would no longci
be the countryman ofl ewis Williams '

delight to gaze "As AnsticVi ju t as Cato pure,' he has
stood before the world the advocate of justice to individuals
and the Government
His indomitable and unbending integrity, his consistency as a
politician, and his adherence to the best mteiests of his country,
are too distinguished even for eulogy
Kemarkable for his sound judgment and common sense,

Though not b'llhant and eloquent yet men of brilliancy and
eloquence in this hall were hia inferiors, and his hg/it, safe
and steadfast, shone even over the path of more aspiring slates
men
budden and melancholy as is h's death, he was still spared
long and fai hfully to serve his native State, and his memory will
be among the uchest ofhertreasuies
When called to visit my departed fnend, I found him sinking
into death, and at the bedside of the dying patriot I íealized the
loss which I this House, and this country have sustained, and I
cannot repress the utterance of my deep grief at this sudden and
overwhelming bereavement
It is with an aching heart I have now risen to speak the Ian
guaee of a long cherished affection for a friend, a patriot, and an
honest man
