River. Large numbers of deserters and bushwhackers in considerable parties are returning from the rebel armies to Missouri, and it is desirable that none of them be permitted to cross to the north side of the Missouri River. All precautions possible have been taken by the land forces in the State, but the services of two or three gun-boats of the character mentioned would be invaluable in patrolling the river, destroying all rafts, flats, skiffs, &amp;c., except at authorized places of crossing and in intercepting parties of the enemy attempting in any manner to cross the river. If you can sent the boats asked for their commanders had best communicate fully with General Dodge, commanding Department of the Missouri, who can keep them advised of the position and orders of the land forces and can give them intelligence of the approach of parties of the enemy coming from the south toward the river. Will you please advise me at your earliest convenience whether you will be able to comply with this request?

I am, admiral, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Arkansas:

SIR: Your letter informing me that the general commanding had approved Colonel Harrison's (First Arkansas Cavalry) colony system, and the issue of provisions to the same, is just received. Permit me to state that these colonies are not formed by the people, but by Colonel Harrison, who has virtually driven the people from their homes to these colonies. The people are very much opposed to the manner in which these colonies are organized, and hundreds of them have appealed to me for relief, stating that they did not want to leave their homes, where they were able to live without assistance from the Government. At a public meeting in Fayetteville Major Worthington, now dead, declared in a speech that any man who did not go into these colonies would be shot and have his house burned, &c. Colonel Harrison was present at this meeting, and did not correct the impression which went out-that every man must go into the colonies or be considered a bushwhacker. I have no confidence in any home-guard organization which is compulsory. If the people are oppressed, as I
