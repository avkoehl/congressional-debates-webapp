Major ZEALOUS B. TOWER,U. S. Engineer Corps:

SIR: With this you will receive an order assigning you to duty according to your brevet rank, and placing you under my command. You will proceed without delay to the Barrancas and assume the command of the troops and forts in and about Pensacola Harbor. You will wait on the commander of the Pensacola navy-yard, ask his hearty co-operation in the great object of your mission, viz, to prevent the seizure of those works or either of them by any body of men whatsoever. Should either of them be preoccupied by any hostile body of men you will first summon them to surrender, and, in case of refusal, consult with the naval commander as to the sufficiency of your join means to compel a surrender, and if it should appear to both on grave consideration that the means are sufficient you will exert them to a reasonable extent to effect that object.

Should the intruders surrender without the application of force you may permit them to depart in pease, with the promise of an exemption from legal pursuit, and if the surrender be the result of the application of force permit the captives to depart, but without any promise whatever.

With every confidence in you, I remain yours, truly,

WINFIELD SCOTT.
