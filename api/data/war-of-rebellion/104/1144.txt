Colonel C. G. ARMISTEAD,

Commanding at Canoe Station:

Dispatch received. Inform General Adams for his action that the enemy's cavalry are moving in the direction of Andalusia. Keep in the front of the column moving from Pensacola until your command is endangered by the movement of this cavalry, which I think is not immediate. It is desired that you keep as close to the enemy as possible, and be governed by the instructions sent you, which are in compliance with instructions sent me, emanating from Major-General Maury.
