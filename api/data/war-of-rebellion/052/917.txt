HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1863.

Respectfully returned for correction.

Major Mendenhall, chief of artillery, reports that you have but twelve in place of eighteen guns.

By order of Major-General Crittenden:

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

How is this, Bradley?

BESTOW.

This report is made up rom the one that was made on the 28th for the 19th of September. We did have eighteen guns on that date.

C. BRADLEY,

Captain.

Respectfully forwarded corrected.

Captain Estep's company is so divided up and scattered that it was impossible to get a correct report of effective force in time for this report. The chief of artillery made a report as nearly correct as he could from previous reports, but forgot about the guns being non est.

Respectfully,

M. P. BESTOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
