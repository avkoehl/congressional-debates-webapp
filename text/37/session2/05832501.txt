THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

As far as relates to the history ©f Hayti, the very
events by which it is marked, not only during the
existence ofsiavery butsinceemancipation in 1793,
show the inferior state of its civilization, and espe-
cially of its present negro rulers. From its discov-
ery by^Columbus in 1492, and the subsequent
foundation of St. Domingo by the Spaniards, until
its pillage in 1586 by the British Admiral Drake,
devastation and the extermination of the aborig-
ines by their former rulers appear to have been the
only work. Hayti then fell partly under the power
of French filibusters, who, in 1630, took entire
possession of and colonized the western portions
of the island. The colony was recognized by
France in 1677; and in 1697,at the congress of Rys-
wick, the French possession thereof was sanc-
tioned by Spain, England, and Holland. From
that period up to 1789, a period of ninety-two
years, during which the French ruled, Hayti in-
creased both in population and in commerce, and
the statistics of the latter year bring the exports
for the same at the high figure of 205,000,OOOf.
(nearly $48,000,000.) But the rude treatment of
the slaves during this period ripened into-revolu-
tion. Forgetting the unsuccessful attempt at re-
bellion of 1722, they rose en masse against then-
French masters in 1791, under the leadership of
one Bonkman. After commmitting all sorts of
atrocities, they completed their work by a mas-
sacre of all the white race, June 23, 1793, under
Mayaca, another black chief.
In 1794 France appointed Toussaint L'Ouver-
ture, a negro, general-in-chief of the Haytien
troops. This is the negro whom Wendell Phil-
lips thought equal, if not superior, to G-eorge
Washington. In 1795 Spain ceded to France the
east part of the island. Soon after Toussaint de-
clares the island independent. In 1802 the Frcnch
General Leclcrc, with twenty thousand Frcnch
troops, lands atSt. Domingo,surprises and makes
Toussaint prisoner, and sends him to France. In
the following year Dossalines, another negro
chieftain, leads the blacks, beats the French, and
drives off the island Rochambeau, Leclerc's suc-
cessor, who is thereby compelled to surrender to
the British fleet. After this, Dessalines assumes
imperial powers over the island, under the name
of " James I." In 1806 he is assassinated, and,
after Petheois's and Cliristoph's quarrels for the
possession of the throne up to 1820, one Boyer
assumes the power, and is proclaimed in 1822.
France recognizes the independence of tho island in
1825, and receives an indemnity of 150,000,OOOf.
therefor. Jn 1843, Boyer is accused of tyranny
and deposed. Herard succeeds him; then Guer-
rier, in 1844; then Pierrot, in 1845; then Picche,
in 184G, and then Soulouque, m 1847.
While the negro presidents were thus succeed-
ing one another, St. Domingo secedes in 1844,
and constitutes itself an independentrepublic, un-
der Piesiderit Pedro Santana. France recognized
the new republic in 1848; England in 1850. In
1849, August 26, Soulouque becomes Emperor,
under the name of Faustm I. In December 22,
1858, a new revolution arises, led by Fabre
Geffrard. On the 15th of January, 1859, Sou-
louque abdicates, and Geffrard is proclaimed
President the same day. On March 18,186J,St.
Domingo asks to be annexed to Spam, and the
request is granted by the Queen on the 20th of
the following May. The portion of the island
thus annexed to Spain is by far the largest, though
less populated. The Gotha Almanac gives it an
area of 12,960 square miles; but from recent ad-
measurement by a French officer, it appears to
have about 15,000 square miles, having a popu-
lation of little over 200,000. The republic of
Hayti has, according to Gotha, an area of 9,00U,
and by recent measurement 10,000, square miles,
with a population of 560,000 inhabitants. Its
revenue in 1859 was $1,762,500: expenditure,
$972,572; debt to France, 60,000,OOOf., (about
$11,250,000,) the original debt of 150,000,OOOf.
having been greatly reduced.
In the Commercial Relations for 1860, page 701,
our commerce with Hayti is set down for all the
ports. I know my friend from Massachusetts re-
lies on a statement inserted in the speech of the
Senator I have named; and it is said to be made
out m the Treasury. I greatly distrust anything
in the shape of figures about Hayti. There are
money sharks about ready to trade in the busi-
ness of shipping our negroes thither; and their
motives for making figures are not always the
most unselfish. From the volume and page above
I find the following:
Exports to
Port au Prince for three quarters..77 vessels* $988,657 79

Adding to the above figures the approximative
commerce of the last quarter for the returns of
Port au Prince and Aux Cayes, and the sums not
shown in the exports from this country to Gona-
ives, viz:

In his pamphlet speech, Mr. Sumner gives the
sums of $2,673,682 for one year's exports, and
$2,062,723 for imports during the same period,
ending September, 1860. There is a large mistake
certainly in the imports here. The last returns of
the general commerce of Ilayti for 1859 £;ive the
following figures, viz: Imports 9,000,000Russian
thalers, little over $6,000,000; exports 12,000,000
thalers. The number of vessels employed in that
trade were 310, measuring 61,420 tons, and of these
152 were A me rican, 56 Engl ish, 54 French, and the
other 48 of all nations. When we compare these
figures with those shown in the returns of 1789,
at which period the exports alone reach the sum
of 205,000,OOOf., (about $48,000,000,) we cannot
help admitting the deteriorated state of the indus-
trial capacities of the black Haytiens.
In relation to Liberia, the books of geography
and statistics give the following information: area
about 25,000 square miles, population 200,000,
colony founded in 1821; the territory purchased
from the aborigines. Over twenty small sover-
eignties were thus extinguished. The declaration
of Independence and political existence as a Gov-
ern men t dates in 1847,at which period they adopted
a constitution somewhat similar to ours. They
elect their president for two, their senators for four,
and their representatives for two years. AU men
who own real estate to the amount of thirty dol-
lars are electors. Their revenue is derived from
duty on imports and the sale of public lands.
These are sold at from fifty cents to one dollar
and a quarter per acre. Their capital is Monrovia,
besides which they have eight small towns and
several minor settlements. The produce so far
lias been ivory, palm oil, common gold dust,
coffee, sugar, cocoa, cotton, indigo, ginger, and
an ow root. Horses and other draught animals do
not prosper >and goods are brought on men's backs
from long distances. The climate so far has been
unhealthy. Communications, except by water be-
tween the sca-ports,are difficult from the absence
of roads.
In Commercial Relations for 1860, page 680, I
find the navigation and commerce of the United
States with Monrovia during the four quarters
ending September, 1860, to be as follows:
Exports,
Fh&t quarter   11 vessels. $33,657 00

If there is any commerce with other ports of
Liberia it is not shown. In page 6, column second,
of pamphlet speech made by Mr. Sumner, on this
bill, the exports to Monrovia are brought up tvo
#900,000, anil to the whole republic, to $400,000!
Quite in contrast with the above statement.
England recognized the republic of Liberia in
1848, and Prance in 1854. From the late reports
of the Colonization Society, it would seem that
Spain and other Powers have since done the same
as I propose to do it commercially. According-
to Gotha, the three Powers first named have each
a consul at Monrovia. The United States have a
vice commercial agent at Monrovia and one at
Gaboon. Liberia has nine consuls in England and
one or two at each of the other countries above,
except the United States.
Since the area before mentioned, the republic
has extended its limits, and it must therefore have
over 30,000 square miles. Its population are emi-
grants from this country.. They have been slaves
here. They do not exceed 15,000. The savage
population is over 200,000.
From its social relations with the neighboring
negro tribes, it exerciscs quite an influence over
nearly two millions of souls. Its geographical
position and its capacity of producing many arti-
cles, make its prospects bright, and it can bo looked
upon as a center from which improvement may
diverge. As a sortof appanage of the United States
I would not discourage its progress. Nor do I
believe tho best friends of Liberia wish to see it
made the abolition foot-ball in this House for party
ends. Those who now seek to make Liberia the
instrument for forcing their doctrines of equality,
have not heretofore been friends to the colony and
its objects.
The question occurs with reference to both Hayti
and Liberia, whether we cannot with the aid of
commercial agents and consuls, and without the
aid of ministers resident, assist in the development
of the prosperity and trade of these countries.
This is the sincere desire which I had in offer-
ing my substitute. Therefore, I will not contro-
vert iiny statement as to the commerce of these
countries. Be it great or small, I would foster it.
But, Mr. Speaker,it matters not how much our
commerce is with these countries, thatcommcrce
is not to be increased and fostered by the mode
proposed by the gentleman from Massachusetts.
The object sought by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts in this bill is not so much to increase the
commercial relations of the United States with the
countries named as to give a sort of dignity and
equality to these republics, because they are black
republics. It is, therefore, literally a Black Re-
publican measure, and that is all there is in it. If
the gentleman really wants to enlarge our com-
mercial relations with them, my amendment will
answer that purpose. It will be most effectual,
because consuls general invested with the power
to make treaties will answer every commercial
purpose. The idea seems to prevail with the gen-
tleman that no one can make a treaty or foster
commerce between nations except a minister res-
ident. Now, sir, the very origin and intention of
the consular ofli.ee and his function are to protect
commerce. That is his special business, and
while we may also authorize consuls general to
make treaties, and exercise other diplomatic func-
tions, still commerce is his sole object and aim.
It is not worth while to say that our consuls in
foreign countries cannot make treaties; that they
are not clothed with diplomaticfunctions. If this
be so, my amendment proposes to give them
j whatever power tliey may require for that pur-
!i pose. It is very well known that, our consul at
! Japan, Townsend Harris, and while consul, made
1 a treaty between thatempireand the United States,
i! nor do I know that special powers had to be con-
j! ferred upon him. In the Statutes at Large for the
|j Thirty-Sixth Congress, page99, is to be found the
: treaty which was made between Japan and the
'i United States. It was made in the city of Yedo,
J Japan, on the 29th of July, 1858, and was ratified
:j by the President and the Senate in 1860. Itissigned
I by Townscnd Harris, " consular agent of Japan
| on tho part of the United States of America,"and
I by the proper officers on the part of his Majesty
| the Tycoon, and the empire of Japan. The House
I will see from this instance that these consular
■ agents can not only make treaties, but that they
i are much more likely than ministers to foster and
i increase commerce with foreign nations. It is
