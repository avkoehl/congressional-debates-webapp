Those are the three great European trades—
a trade now done to some extent in steam.
Formerly the Baltic and North Sea trade was
against us, because in the Baltic, with their
cheap timber and labor, they built vessels as
cheaply, or cheaper, than we could do. But
the trade of the European Atlantic ports and
the Mediterranean trade was in our hands, and
now, as you see, it is in the hands of Great
Britain.
Let us go further. Here is the East India
trade—a trade done exclusively then and now
in sail vessels. It is a trade calling for a
large amount of tonnage, because it takes ves-
sels nearly two years to make a voyage:

The trade was nearly all formerly in our
hands, and now two thirds of it is in Bri-
tish!
Mr. Speaker, let us come a little nearer
home. Here is the West India trade—a trade
right here, almost within sound of my voice,
a trade that we had the whole of. a trade that
is as much ours as the coasting trade, if your
laws would permit us to do it:

And this winter I understand the sugars from
Havana to New York were brought chiefly in
British vessels.
Ay! without regard to race or color, the
little island of Hayti, with whom we have dip-
lomatic intercourse, sends her sugar and dye
stuffs to us in British bottoms, and we send
otit to her the products of our great West in
British vessels.
Here, again, is the South American trade—
a trade that was ours, and one which one
wonld think we had a continental interest in
retaining :

Before the war eleven to one in our favor,
and now nearly three to one against us!
So all the great trades of the world are being
done by Liverpool and Loudon. They come
across the Atlantic, and go to the West Indies,
to Mexico, Guatemala, to liio, around the
Horn and up to Valparaiso, bringing the hides
and iron and copper and everything else pro-
duced by South America away in British bot-
toms to A merican ports. And not only that,
but they carry away in British bottoms the
great annual products of this country, and dis-
tribute them among the South American coun-
tries.
I said that the figures speak stronger than
any language I can use as to the present chaf^g; „
ter of these great trades. I now submit to you
that this is a matter not of interest to the coast
merely, but to the whole country. Why, sir,
the great West wants cheap transportation as
much as the sea-board wants to afford it. There
is no portion of the remotest State in the West
which produces wheat for the market which
does not find the price of its products at home
measured by the price at Liverpool. And the
price in Liverpool is composed of the cost of
production, the price of transportation to the
sea-board, and the price of transportation across
the Atlantic to the market iu Europe. And the
cost of transportation bears a very large pro-
portion to the cost of the article at the place
of sale.
Now, the effect of the present condition of
things is, that you exclude from this carrying
trade all American competition. You will not
allow us to come in and compete for this car-
rying trade. You say practically to our ship-
owners, '1 Hands off! We want British vessels
to come over here and carry these products,
and we do not want any American competition
in the business!"
I submit to you, sir, that if you will allow
the ship-builders and the ship-owners to come
in on fair terms they will compete for this
transportation and will cheapen it. It cannot
be otherwise. It is but a monopoly now, a
monopoly made by our laws, in the hands of
European merchants and European ship-own-
ers. They have come over here; they have
established themselves in New York. To-day
the importing merchants of New York are for-
eigners. Tljey have no interest whatever in
your Government; they have no interest in
the prosperity of your country. They import
these goods and sell them to you. They ex-
port the goods you wish to export, and do it
in vessels of their own nationality; and when
they have accumulated their fortunes they will
retire and enjoy them in the countries of their
birth. Certainly, in that aspect of the case,
this is a matter of national importance, of in-
terest to all sections of this country, and it
cannot by any logic or statesmanship be con-
fined to the coast.
Another thought of importance is this: that
this freight or cost of transportation is an im-
portant-matter in making up the balance of
trade. Formerly, when this carrying trade was
in our hands, we had the outward freight and
the return freight. When we sent abroad our
products we not only got pay for the products
themselves, but we were also paid for the freight •
upon them. But now, when we import silks,
or iron, or cotton, or woolen, or other goods
—as we do now to the extent of 8300,000,000
annually, yes, in one year to the extent of
$500,000,000—-we not only pay that $600,-
000,000, but tlie freight on it, which is a very
large percentage of the cost, and it all goea
abroad together, and the whole sum is neces-
sarily in gold; so that we are sending our gold
abroad to pay for the freight on the goods ws
import; and the freight on the goods we ex-
port also goes abroad, and it forms a very large
item in making up the balance of trade.
There is another consideration of very con-
siderable importance in an economical point
of view. There is in this country but little
need for a navy in time of peace if you can so
encourage our ship-yards that they can extem-
porize a navy in time of war. How is it now
with us'? The ship-yards capable of producing
large vessels have gone to decay; the men
are discharged and etagaged in other pursuits.
In the matter of producing vessels, either in
the navy-yards or the commercial ship-yards
of the country, wo have nothing on this con-
tinent to compare with Europe. It is easy for
us to boast—ana we are accustomed to do it—-
about, our Navy and our facilities for building
ships; but what are the facts? Why, sir, the
Milhvall Dockyard Company on the Thames,
in the neighborhood of London, a mere private
enterprise, is capable to-day of producing more
ships than any navy-yard in this country. It
is so complete an establishment that it can take
in the pig iron and the "bar iron and out of them
produce an iron-clad ship of war, every part
and parcel of'her, including, I think, even her
armament. That establishment, with its erec-
tions, occupies fifteen acres, and it is rivaled
by other establishments producing such im-
mense ships as the Great Eastern, of twenty-
three thousand tons burden, and those great
iron-clad steamships of the British navy.
Such are the vessels produced in the private
dockyards of England. Then there is Laird's
great establishment at Birkenhead, where have
been produced the Alabama and several of the
large steamships of war now in the British
navy. Then, again, tho Clyde steamers are
famous the world over. We have them plying
to and from almost every seaport on the Atlantic
coast. We have not only given up producing
steamships in this country, but we hail with
joy the enterprise of a foreigner if he will but
introduce a steamship line anywhere upon this
coast. The large city of Baltimore, with two
hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, cele-
brated in former days for its tonnage, pro-
ducing that remarkable specimen of naval
architecture formerly known as the Baltimore
clipper, has to-day not only given up its efforts
at'foreign commerce, but celebrated a gala day
a short time since, the day on which a Clyde
steamer arrived in the harbor, as a precursor
of a line established there to do the business
of importing and exporting such goods as
Baltimore might desire to buy or to send
abroad. The citizens turned out in the street
and welcomed thefiut arrival of steamers that
the enterprising Liverpool firm had concluded
to send to that imbecile port. They were as
glad as Hons; Kong might be at the arrival of
the 1 acific mail steamers first ship ! That is
the condition to which the great city of Balti-
more is reduced to-day ; and it is but a speci-
men of Ihe position of the other cities of this
continent. From the port of New York there
sails on an average one sea-going steamship
tvetj jjj, built, in Europe, and no one of
them flies at her masthead the stars and stripes
as her national einbletn. The last of our
American line, the 1'ulton find the Arago, were
■sold at auction the other day in New York, to
be hustled oil" and broken up as old iron. In
the place of those vessels we have from foreign
ship yards magnificent specimens of naval
