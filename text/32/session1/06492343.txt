object to every amendment which may be offered,
unless I can have an equal chance with others.
Mr. MEADE. The amendments to which the
gentleman alludes were before the Committee on
Commerce. I think if the gentleman will examine
this amendment he will not object to it.
Mr. EDGERTQN. 1 insist upon my objection.
The House then considered the amendments of
the Committee on Commerce, the fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, and eighth clauses of section nine.
The amendments of the committee, striking out
the parts in brackets, thus [ ], and inserting the
parts in italics, were agreed to, viz:
" Fourth. That when the inspection in detail is com-
pleted, and the inspectors approve of the vessel and her
equipment throughout, they shall make and subscribe a
certificate to the collector of the district, substantially as
follows;
State of , District of ,
Application having been made in writing by
to the subscribers, inspectors for said district, to
examine the steamer , of , whereof
are owners, and is master; we having
performed that service, now, on this day of ,
A. D. , do certify, that she was built in the year
, is in ali respects staunch, seaworthy, and in
good condition tor navigation, having suitable means of es-
cape in case of accident from the mam to the upper deck ;
that she is provided with (here insert the number of state-
rooms, the number of berths therein, the number of other
permanent bei ths lor cabin passengers, the nunibei ofberths
for deck or other classes ol passengers, the number of pas-
sengers of each class for whom she has suitable accom-
modations, and in case of steamers sailing to or from any
European port or to or front <tny port on the Atlantic or the
Pacific, a distance of one thousand miles or upwards, the
number of each whom she is permitted to carry, and in case
of a steamer sailing to any other port, a distance of five
hundred miles or upwards, the number of deck passengers
she is permittedto carry; also, the number, ofboilets, and
the form, dimensions, and material of which each boileris
made, the thickness ot the metal and when made—if after
this act takes effect, and of iron, whether they art' such m
Q-il respects as the act requires, whether each boiler has
been tried by hydrostatic test, the amount of pressure to the
square inch in pounds applied to it, whether the amount
allowed as the maximum working power was determined
by the rule prescribed by this act, if not, the reason for a
departure from it; also, the number.of safety-valves required,
their capacity, the load prescrihed for each valve, how
many are left in the control of the persons navigating the
vessel, [how many, if any, are] whether one is withdrawn
and the manner of securing [them] it against interference—
also, the number and dimensions of supply pipes, and
whether they and the other means provided are sufficient at
all tunes and all circumstance?- when in good order to keep
the water up four inches at h>ast above the top of the flue ;
also the number and dimensions of the steam-pipes; the
number and kind of engines, the dimensions of their cylin-
ders; the number and capacity of the forcing-pumps, and
how worked ; the number and kind of gauge-cocks, water
and steam gauges, where situate and how secured; also the
manner of using alloyed metals and the pressure at which
they are known by the inspectors to fuse; the equipments
for the extinguishment of fires, including hose, fire buckets,
and axes ; the provisions for saving life in case of accident,
including boats, hfe-preservers, and substitutes therefor,
where kept, and all other provisions made on board for the
security of the lives of passengers.) And we further cer-
tify, that the equipment of the vessel throughout, including
pipes, pumps, and other means to keep the water up to the
points aforesaid, hose, boats, life-preservers, and other I
things, is m conformity to the piovisions of law; and that ■
we declare it to be our deliberate conviction, founded upon r
the inspection which we have made,thatthe vessel maybe :
employed as a steamer upon the waters named in the appli- |
cation", without peril to life [or propeityj from any imper- j
fection of form, materials, workmanship, orairangementof J
die several parts, or from age or use. And we further cer- j
tify, that said vessel is to run within the following limits, j
town: from to and back, touching at in - i
termediate places. !
"Fifth. Upon the application of the master or owner of j
any steamer employed [only in the navigation of rivers] in .
the carriage of passengers, for a license to carry gunpow- |
der, oil of turpentine, oil of vitriol, camphine, or other ex- j
plosive burning fluids and matenals which ignite by friction, i
or either of them, the inspectors shall examine such vessel; [
and if they find that she is provided with chests or safes i
composed of metal, or entirely lined therewith, or one or j
more apartments thoroughly lined with metal at a secure |
distance from any fire, they may grant a certificate to that j
etfect, authorizing such vessel to carry as freight any of the i
articles aforesaid, those of each description to be secured j
in such chest, safe, or apartment containing no other article, i
and carried at a distance from any fire to be specified m the j
certificate: Provided, That any such certificate may be re- I
yoked or annulled at any time by the inspectors, upon proof j
that either of the said articles have been earned on boaid i
•said vessel, at a place or in a manner not authorized by i
such certificate, or that any of the provisions of this act in \
relation thereto have been violated. j
"Sixth. The said inspectors shall keep a regular record ,
of certificates of inspections of vessels, their boilers, en- :
gines, and machinery, whether of approval or disapproval, ;
and when recorded, the original shall be delivered to the j
collector of the district; they shall keep a like record of i
certificates, authorizing gunpowder, oil of turpentine, oil of
vitriol, camphene, or other explosive burning fluids, and
materials which ignite by friction, or either of them, to he
carried as freight, bit any such vessel, and when recorded
deliver the originals to said collector; they shall keep a hko
record of all licenses to pilots and engineers, and all reve-
cations thereof, and shall, fiom time to tune, report to Ike
supervising inspector of their respective districts, in writing,
their decisions on all applications for such licenses, or pro-
ceedings for the revocation thereof, and all testimony re-
ceived by them in such proceedings.
[Seventh. The inspectors shall appoint and classify all
engineers and pilots, and determine how many are neces-
sary for each steamer, except ferry-boats, and of what
classes.j
"Seventh. The inspectors shall license and classify all
engineers and pilots of steamers carrying passengers.
"Eighth. Whenever any person, claiming to be qualified
to perform the duty of engineer upon steamers carrying pas-
sengers, shall apply for a certificate, the Board of Inspect-
ors shall examine the applicant, and the proofs which he
produces in support of his claim; and if, upon full consid-
eration, they are satisfied that his character, habits of life,
knowledge and experience in the duties of an engineer,
are all such as to authorize the belief that the applicant is
a suitable and safe person to be intrusted with the powers
and duties of such a station, they shall give him a certifi-
cate to that effect tor one year, signed by them, in which
certificate they shall state the time of the examination, and
shall assign the appointee to the appropiiate class of engi-
neers."
The next amendment of the committee was
read—strikeout from section nine as follows, viz:
"Ninth. Whenever any person, claiming to be a skillful
pilot, shall offer himself for an appointment, the said board
shall make diligent inquiry as to his character and merits;
and if satisfied that he possesses the requisite skill, and is
trustworthy and faithful, they shall give him a certificate to
that effect, authorizing him to be a pilot within the limits
prescribed in the certificate ; but any such engineer or pilot
may be removed upon proof of negligence, unskillfnlness,
inattention to the duties of the station, or any misconduct,
which, in the judgment of the board, tends to disqualify
him; and, moreover, all appointments and removals shall
be submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, by the col-
lector, lor his approbation or disapprobation: Provided,
hoivever, If,m cases of refusal to license engineers or pilots,
and in eases of removal by the local board of inspectors,
any engineer or pilot deeming himself wronged bv such re-
fusal or such removal, may, on application within thirty
days to a supervising inspector, have his case examined
anew by such a supervising inspector, upon producing a
certified copy of the reasons assigned by the local board
for their doings in the premises, and such supervising in-
spector may, it he sees good reasons therefor, oveirulc the
decision of such local board of inspectors ; and like pro-
ceedings upon the same conditions may be had by the mas-
ter or owner of any vessel, for which the said local hoard
refuses, upon inspection, to give a certificate of approval"—
and insert as follows, viz:
" Ninth. Whenever any person claiming to be a skillful
pilot for any such vessel shall offer himself for a license,
the said board shall make diligent inquiry as to his character
andmerits; and if satisfied that he possesses the requisite
skill, and is trustworthy and faithful, they >hall give him a
certificate to that effect, licensing him for one year to be a pi-
lot of any such vessel within the limits prescribed in the cer-
tificate ; but the license of any such engineei or pilot may
be revoked upon proof of negligence, uuskillfulness, or
inattention to the duties of the station : Provided, however,
If, in eases of refusal to license engineers or pilots, and in
cases of the revocaiion ofany license by the local board of
inspectors, any engineer or pilot deeming himself wronged
by such refusal or revocation, may, within thirty days after
notice thereof, on application to a supervising inspector,
have his case examined anew by such supervising inspect-
or, upon producing a certified copy of the reasons assigned
by the local hoard for their doings m the premise*.; and
such supervising inspector may revoke the decision of such
local board of inspectors, and license such pilot or engi-
neer; and like proceedings, upon the same conditions, may
be had by the master or owner of any such vessel, or of any
steamboat boiler, for which the said local board shall have
refused, upon inspection, to give a certificate of approval,
or shall have notified such master or owner of any tepairs
necessary after Mich certificate ha-, been granted."
The question was put, and the amendment was
agreed to.
The next amendments of the Committee on
Commerce, striking from clauses eleven, thirteen,
fourteen, and fifteen of section nine, the words
inclosed in brackets, thus [ ], and inserting the
words in italics, were read and agreed to, viz:
"Eleventh. In addition to the [semij annual inspection
it shall be the duty of said board to examine seasonably,
steamers arriving and departing, so often as to enablethem
to detect any neglect to comply with the requirements of
law, and also any defects or imperfection'* becoming appa-
rent after the inspection aforesaid, and tending to render the
navigation of the vessel unsafe, which service may be per-
formed by one of the hoard; and if he shall discover an
omission t  comply with the law, or that repairs have bo-
come necessary to make the vessel safe, he shall at once
notify the master, staling in the notice what is required;
and if the master deems the requirement unreasonable or
unnecessary, he may take the opinion of the board thereon,
[which shall be final;] and if dissatisfied with the decision
of such board, may apply for a reexamination of the case to
the supervising inspector as is hereinbefore provided ; ami if
he shall refuse or neglect to complv with [their] the require-
ment of iAe local board, and shall, contrary theieto, and
while the same remains unreveised by the supervising in
spcctor, employ the vessel by navigating her ; [she sinII bo
liable to the same penalties as if she had been run without
alicense] the master and owner shall be liable for uny dam-
age t > the passenger* and their baggage u.hich shall occur from
any defects so as afot esaulstated m said notice, which shall be
in writing, and all inspections and orders shall be promptly
made by the inspectors; and where it can be safel> done in
their judgment, they shall permit repairs to be made where
those interested can most conveniently do [it]//tern; and
no inspectors of one district shall modify or annul the do-
ings of the inspectors of another district in regard to repairs,
unless there is a change in the state of things demanding
more repairs than were thought necessary when the order
was made; nor shall the inspectors of orie district appoint
a person coming from another, if such person has been re-
jected for unfitness or want of qualifications.
" Thirteenth. The said board of inspectors shall have
power to summon before them witnesses, [and to examine
them,] and to compel their attendance hythe same process
as in courts of law > and after reasonable tOrac. given to the
alleged delinquent of the time and place of investigation to
examine said witnesses under oath, touching the perform-
ance of their duties, by engineers and pilots of any such ves-
sel; and if it shall appear satisfactorily that any such en-
gineer or pilot is incompetent, or that life [or property] has
been placed in peril by reason of such incompetency, or by
negligence or misconduct on the part of any such person,
the board shall immediately suspend [him] or revoke Aw li-
cense, and report their doings to the chief officer of the cus-
toms; and the said chief officer of the customs shall pay
out of the revenues heiein provided such sums to any wit-
ness so summoned under the provisions of this act, for his
actual travel and attendance, as shall be officially certified
l>y an inspector hearing the case, upon the back of the sum-
mons, not exceeding the rates allowed to a witness for
travel and attendance in the circuit and district courts of
the United States.
"Fourteenth. That the said board shall report promptly
all their doings to the chief officer of the customs, as well
as all omissions or refusals to comply with the provisions
of law, on the part of any owner or master of [a] any suck
vessel propelled in whole or m part by steam, carrying pas-
sengers.
" Fifteenth. That it shall at all times be the duty of alf
engineetsand pilots [appointed] licensed under this act, and
ail mates, to assist the inspectors m the examination of
[the] any such vessels to which any such engineer, mate,
or pilot belongs, and to point out all defects and imperfec-
tions in the hull or apparatus for steaming, and also to make
known to them, at the earliest opportunity, all accidents
occasioning serious injury jo the vessel or her equipment,
whereby life [or property] may be in danger, and in default
thereof," the license of any such engineer or pilot shall be
[dismissed from the service] revoked."
The next amendments of the Committee on
Commerce, striking out the following sections and
parts of sections inclosed in brackets, thus [ ],
and inserting the words m italics, were severally
considered and agreed to, viz:
" [Sec - 10. .iQnd be it further enacted, That in each of the
districts of Savannah in Geoigia, Chailestori in South Car-
olina,Norfolk in Virginia, Baltimore in Maryland, Philadel-
phia m Pennsylvania, New York m New York, New Lon-

Maine, and San Francisco m California, there shall be two
; inspectors, one possessing the requisite qualifications, as
] heiein provided, in shipbuilding and the uses of steam in
navigation, the olhei in engineering, and in the const! uction
and qualities of the appaiatus for steaming, who shall ex-
ercise all the powers herein confeired, except that of ap-
pointing pilots for said districts.)
" Sec. [11-] 10.*4nd be itfurther enactcd, That in those
cases where the number of passengers is limited by the in-

owners, or either of them, shall be liable to an> person
suing tor the same, to forfeit the amount of passage money
and ten dollars for each passenger beyond the number al-
lowed. And moreover, in all cases of an express*,or implied
undertaking to transport passengers, or to supply them with
food and lodging from place to place, and suitable provision
is not made of a full and adequate supply of good and
wholesome food and water, and of suitable lodging for all
t such passengers, or where barges or other craft impeding
the piogrcss are taken in tow, for a distance [not] exceeding
five hundred miles, without pi evious and seasonable notice
to sueh passengers, in ail such cases the owners and the
vessel shall be liable to refund all the money paid for the
pa >age, and to pay also the damage sustained" by such de-
fault or delay: Provided, however, That if in any such
| case a satisfactory bond is given to the marshal for the ben-
efit of the plaintiff, to secure the satisfaction of such judg-
ment as he may recover, the vessel shall be released.
" Sec. [14.] |3. Jind be it further enacted, That hereafter
all boilers of steamboats made of iron shall be constructed
of plaies which have been [inspected, approved, and
marked] stamped according to the provisions of this act.
"[Sec. 15. beitfurther enacted, That the inspectors
of boilers within the several collection districts herein
named MiaH also be the inspectors of boiler iron within their
respective districts, and perform the duties required by this
act, and shall also be the inspectors for that purpose in dis-

; this act."]
The next amendment of the Committee on
Commerce was to strike out the following section,
viz:
"Sec-16. -And be it further enacted, That it shall be the
duty of such inspectors to ascertain the quality of the ma-
terial of which boiler plates aie made, and to satisfy them-
selves, by any suitable means, whether the mode of manu-
facturing has been such as to produce iron equal to the best
and most reliable qualitv made with charcoal, such as in
their judgment may be used foi generating steam power
without hazard to life or piopertj ; and no plate of iron
shall be approved which is made of unsuitable material, or
of which the manufacture is imperfect, or is not such as to
give confidence m its strength, or which is less than one
touith of an inch in thickness, for a boiler offoity-two
inches in diameter, and in that proportion for boilers of
greater or less diameters, or which is made of any but
wrought iron, nf a quality equal to the best quality made
with charcoal;"
