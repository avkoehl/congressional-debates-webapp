classes notoriously unapt to furnish such as wer fitted for the service. The intelligence, the activity, and the vigor of the country was carefully called for the general service, and you were required to glean the exhausted field of its remnants and fragments for the agencies who are to decided what are the public necessities, what are the personal and civil rights of the citizens, and to execute the law applicable to these solemn functions. Wherever a vigorous and intelligent man was found engaged in their performance that same law peremprtorily removed him. With this feeble material, so inappropriate to meet the grave questions I have indicated and so seemingly incompetent to overcome the opposition of constituted authorities, communities, and individuals, this Bureau set to work to collect, conscrible, and organize for military service the scattered and unwilling remnants of a warwasted population. Its function was to create and maintain armies for the public defense and to preserve the social organisms of the country. I have examined the history of such proceedings in other countriers and in other times, and do not hesitate to declare my belief that the results of the operations of conscription in the Confederate States exhibit a wisdom in devising the system and a vigor in its execution which have not been excelled and which, under the circumstances of the country, are very wonderful. In confirmation of this belief I have the honor to refer you to the tabular statements herewith submitted. *

Having then succeeded by the wise energy of the system in overcoming the weakness and inaptitude of the agencies employed and the grave impediments offered, this Bureau was suddenly checked in the successful work by the partial abandonment of that system and the proposed substitution therefor of the most noxious principle and the most dangerous agencies which can be applied to the creation and maintenance of armies for the publthe determination of public necessity, or for the protection of personal right and the social economy. The first appearance of this change was manifested by an attempt to engraft upon your system a rude, and undefined - merely military - inspection. In this fitful shawo I felt the coming storm and ventured to warn you of its danger. I had seen its efforts the former acts of Congress; but foregone conclusion hastened its culmination, and I fear that conscription in the Confederate States may be destinated to become nothing more than a ferocious and ignorant military outrage of public law and personal right, devastating the country and weakening the armies. The transfer to military commanders in the field and their immediate subordinates of the power to determine the public, and the means of enforcing their judgment in selecting the classes for military service and drving at will the individuals of those classes into the field, is field, is fraught with such peril to the cause of the public defense andis so repulsive to a safe public sentiment that I am appalled with apprehension for the consequences. The fearful story of military cosncription under Turkish rule in Egyp may be re-enacted in the Confederate States.

Five hundred thousand men have withered from Egypt in ten years under the blight and military conscription. It is not the loss of men caused by battle and disease, but whem the Pasha's press gangs are out recruiting whole villages are deserted. The men fly to the deserters to escape service, and the wives and children follow to escape the vengeance of the beffled officer whose advancement depends on the length of his muster-roll; and when this man-catcher (this military officer) returns from the pursuit the villages and fields are desolate and the deserts are white with the bleached bones of women and children.
