Commanding Fourteenth Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that the negotiations between General Sherman and General Johnston are still in progress, and there is an arrangement that neither party shall move while negotiations are pending. He wishes you, however, to explore the roads in the direction indicated to you before leaving here, as well as you can, without violating this agreement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GOLDSBOROUGH, April 17, 1865.

Major-General TERRY, Tenth Army Corps, Raleigh:

I have sent my tri-monthly by Captain Collins, going through to-day. Abbott's report not received. One brigade of the Second Division, Nineteenth Corps, is still at Savannah, one at Morehead City, and one here. General Palmer, commanding District of Beaufort, has telegraphed to me for my tri-monthly report. I do not think it is so considered by General Schofield, and therefore declined sending them. If I am right will you please have General Palmer so advised from department headquaters.
