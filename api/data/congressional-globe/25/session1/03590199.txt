AJPfrEÑfrlX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GL(^E,
Inexpedient to charter a National Bank—Mr. Sergeant.
the people of these United States Were led to be-
lieve, and to act upon the belief, that that bank
would be withdrawn at the expiration of thepenod
of its existence fixed by its charter
Sir, what do j ou find then occurring immediately
after this annunciation1 You have had a uniform
cuirency, }ou have had exchanges as near to par
as possible throughoutthis whole extent of countrv
What is more, you have had no such excesses of
overtrading and over speculating as even to de-
stroy that uniformity anü to bring the banks to the
condition they now are I do not mean to saj, sir,
that there was no over trading then It is beyond
the power of this Government, or of any other upon
earih, to prevent ovei trading A specie currency
will not do it, a paper currency will not do it, no
currency will do it If anj gentleman donbis of
this, let him only look at the most remarkable in-
cidents presented m the history of speculation and
trade, and he ft ill find that the two most gigantic
and disastrous schemes of speculation known m
the world's his'ory—the Mississippi scheme m
France, and the South Sea 'cheme in England—
were earned on, one m a countiy where there
was a bank, and the other wheie theie was none
But, sir, no Government, by any contrivance con-
sistent with the freedom of indiv ulupl pursuit, can
prevent over trading Yet this I mean to say, that,
during the existence of a national bank in this
country, whether the people were over trading or
whethei the) were not, over tradtngnever produced
the effects whichit hr done when no national bank
was in existence You have had but a veiyshort
interval betw een the expiration of the bank mI8Il
and the establ shment of a bank m 1810 You have
had a still shelter interval between the expiration
of the last oank and the present period, and yet,
m both, it is not over trading you complain of, much
as you lament that it is a total prostration of the
currency,the destruction of the standard of value,
and alteiations and fluctuations m the value of
vour monev, m such a way and to such an extent
that no two par's of the countrj art in the same
condition, no two departments of the Government
are in the same condition , nay, that no one depart-
ment, as I will presently show you, even the Post
Office Department, can act consistent^ withitself,
but that one man is paid in paper, fiom necessity,
while another mav get specie
Now, I have heard itsaid, that theie was a period
of very great embarrassment m this countiv, m
the year 1819 the time I before adv erted to and so
there was But even one who turns back his
thoughts to that time will recollect, no doubt the
chairman of the Committee of Wavsand Means
remembers it full we'l that at that penod prices
were low, and liiue \n% an over aound vnce ot
monev which fads seeming!) contradicton
neveiihelcss co canted Thev were owing to the
excess of importation m iheveai immediatel) fol
lowing the pe>ce I wns thp languor of trade
which followed over excitement But so it was
That period of 1819 1820 1821 and 182^, w is
not a period when monev v as sc¿u ce, wnen «pecie
waswantmg or when > our eurrenc} wasdebased
or affected It Vías s r a period when monev
was abundant,and prices low piesentirgan ano
maly the converse of the period w e hav e latelv
passed through whenmonej has been scaiceand
puces high Such was the state of things m 1819,
caused by the pievious jeais , and we are now, m
1837 gathering the miserable harvest of the season
prepared for us from 1S30 to 1836
Now, sir T mention tríese facts foi the putpose
of la; mg the ground foi the unav oidable deduc-
tion And with legard to this period of 1830 to
1836 if confie'ence can be placed in making deduc-
tions ftom fie s before }OU, theeudence is ascon
elusive as jt posstblv can bp I assume still with-
out going farthei back that jtrsover banking over-
issues, over Hading fiom some cause oi other, no
matter what, that have proluccd the pres nt em-
barrassments and disoidei I will assume that,
withoui going an\ faithei back to the final or pri-
mar} causes Now onlv observe how over-lrmkmg
o' er spec ilati >n, and the worst consequences of
over speculation and over trading have been pre
cisely co extent w tth'hese peuods when vou have
had no national bank Sir the chartel of the first
Bank of the United S'ales expned on the first of
January,lSU You had then, in the Un ted States,
eighty nine banks On the fust of January, U815,
you had tv/o hundred and eight banhs Ttiat is as
much of the period as can be ascertained betw een
the cessation of the chart-r of the first bank and
H. of Reps.g
the establishment oí the second one Upwards of
a year is to be added, of w hich we have no account
And sir, only note the extraordinary increase, no
less than one hundred and nineteen banks added
in the short space of four yeais That is a period
when }ou had no national bank Well, in the
year 1820, by which lime the national bank esta-
blished had got into operation and got through the
embarrassments of its earlj existence, these banks
had increasea to three hundred and eight Now,
sir, take the next period of ten yea rs, when the na-
tional bank was in full, activ e, and beneficial ope
ration, and you w ill «ee how it worked to regulate
and restrain The whole increase of banks, from
1820 to 1830, if I understand the statement of the
Secretary of the Trc asnrv, is what 1 Why it is
remarkable, and it is a fact ev ery one must dw ell
upon, by that statement it appears that the w hole
number of banks, m 1830, was three hundied and
twenty,being an increase of onlj twelve in ten
years
Now sir, we come to the period when the Bank
of the United States began to v erge towards its dis
solution—when it began to be believed, beyond a
doubt, from clear indications, that it w raid not be
continued What do vou find then 1 Exactly what
you might ha-> e expected From the 1st of Jan-
uary to the 1st of December, 18%, there were 110
new banks established , and whereas, in the year
1830, you had but 320 banks, you have now m the
United States, m only six -years, the period I have
before adverted to, 677 banks, besides 146 branches
How mnch does that give you for the last six
years1 Three hundred and fifty five, being more
than had been established in all the antecedent pe
nods lrom the origin of the Government'
Now, again, sir, look at the increase of banking
capital during the same period
In 1830 you had        -          -          $145 000 000
In 1834 there were added    -              55,000000
In 1835 there w ere added    -              31,000,000
In the beginning of 1816 there were
added         -          -          -               20,000,000
In the remaining part of 1836 there
were added            -          -              72,000,000
$323,000 000
Making a total of three hundred and twenty-
three million of dollars, and something more, up
to this time So much for the number of banks and
banking capital
Now for your circulation, and it will be found to
concur w ith. the other evidence, and comes to pre-
cisely the same result Fiom tne jear 1830 to
1830-7, the circulation of bank pap< r increased in
the Un ted Stales from $,61 000 000 to upw ards of
¡r 185,000,000 The discounts and depoutes were
increased probably in the same proportion, that
is to sav, the sum total of banking operations w as
thus increased with a rapidity never before witnes-
sed, and, I trust, not soon to be witnessed again In
six v ears it was more t^an trebled
feu, I am not adverse to the State banks , there is
too v ast an interest involved in them to be wasted
and destroyed A capí al of between three and
four hundied millions of propcrtv ought not to be
sported with or endangered lor an injury toitnru^t
do ex'ensiv e mischief to individual  and individual
interests But the statement of w Inch I hav e giv en
the particulars deserv es, in mv judgment the se
nous attention of ever) American s aterirían, in it
are mv olved all the evils that are complained of
What is it that has produced over trading and
speculation, and o\ er mtrchases of land * What
is it that lias stimulated the mteres's of this country
to a morbid sta'e of activ itv threatening the ex
istence of ever; thing disturbing the relations be
tween the different portions of the Union, em
barrassmg the intercourse between man and man,
and compelling us to be heie at midnight to pass
bills to rpscue the Tieasurv from impending bank
ruptcv 1 I need not go furthei back, and the result
of the vv hole is that m fortj vars no such thing
ever occurred that in si\ \ears it did occur, and
that m less than six jeais it occurred again am1
that this state of things happened at two periods
precisely identical, and alike distir-* i shed from
tw o o ner periods, identical also w ith each other
w hen it did not happen
The difference, so far as we -"re able to discern,
is to be found m one great leadme circumstance,
that at the two fumable periods 5011 had a great
fiscal institution acting as the fiscal agent ot the
Government, and 9.1 the other period you had none
I will not undertake to show that, even with such an
institution, it is impossible that such a derangement
could happen I do not behere that it would I
am content at the present time to say, that if you
want an experiment, the experiment has been
made You know the results of that experiment
perfectly well, and in a manner to be relied upon,
you know you can have a uniform currency, you
know you can avoid the suspension of specie pay-
ments, you know that you can furnish a medium
between the inhabitants of the most distant parts of
this great confederacy for carrying on your inter-
com se You know it, because you have done r
twice for long periods, and the experiment has
been tw ice so successful that no one can doubt its
efficacy But if any man could doubt its efficacy
upon the mere affirmative evidence, you have had
its opposite also, the negative evidence, also, is
concuirent and complete
You have tried the experiment of doing without
it, and it has twice resulted m the same w ay, and
brought us to the same condition This co ex-
istence is, humanly speaking, and according to the
soundest philosophj, a good reason for inferring
that one is the cause and the other effec And
then you have the deduction from the whole, that a
national bank has preven ed and will prevent such
occurrences and without such an institution you
are inevitably exposed to them
Now, sir, jou are in this crisis not deeper than
vou were before, the remedy is not more difficult
than before, nav, I firmly behsve, and thousands
in the United States believe, that precisely the
same treatment will give relief What is this
crisis1 I have taken from a newspaper of yester-
day I do not recollect from what paper, the follow
ing article

Sir, what a scene does this exhibit 1 What me-
dium of commercial communication is there at that
point between the State of Tennessee and the
adjacent parts of the United States "* Well, sir,
come to vour others, the efheers of your Gov em-
inent One man is paid m specie, another man is
paid in what the department has to give him I
am not now charging any of the officers of an v of
the departments with favoritism, but I speak of
w hat has happened, and, if you please, of that which
inevitably must happen A third man is paid m
United States Bank paper—afourth in Kentucky
paper—a fifth m Ohio paper—a sixth in Alabama
or Vhssissi ppi paper, someamesby means of diafts
and probablj, occasionally, one is paid m drafts on
New Orleans No tw o men are paid in the same
carrencj, and no two men receive the same
amount ev en if the amount of the claims is pre-
cisely the same Then you have a difference be-
tween different departments I mentioned to you
the other da), the case of a claim of a mercantile
house on the depar'ment for about eight hundred
dollars The Treasurer of the United States sent
to that house a draft for eight hundred dollars,
drawn on a bank in Pennsvlvama which had sus-
pended specie paymen's The house sent the draft
back to the Treasurer, statins; that they had paid
one hundred and (went) dollars m specie for postage
in a given time and that thev w an'ed specie to paj
their postages ll it were aoeravng He sent the
draft back again Now I do not impugn this offi-
cer I believe he mterded the best, but he could
notg vc tnem spec e o herwise than as he finall
offeicdit tv a draft on a  ccnbcr in Ohio How
the matter ended, I do not know But what is the
consequence] In 1815 and'16, when a similar
s'a e of things existed, the New England banks
continued *o par specie, the Post Office Depau-
ment had the same command of specie, and the
idea got abroad in Congress that certain gentlemen
had been paid n the Post Office Department by
drafts on those banks where specie w as paid Á
