With regard to the condition of tin tgs on our southern boi

apply there    He did not apprehend that it would apply to
1   xas tt all, because it provided that thtlhutiil&tatis oiiUm

Mr LEGARE said that, mhi& view of the mu i this 11 v

Mr M VON supposed then, that this law was not nenJtl
to a )ply atati to our southwestern frontier
Mr TEGvREsaid he had merely alluded to the Government
of Texas and tono othei portion of tn* southwestern frenticv
Mr 'MASON1 presumed there would be a great contranety of
npitmn m r+1 tion to this ma lei, mt*-e House He desired to
ascertain n hat ih« practical application of this iaw vpouid be
with regard to existing difficulties, and difficulties which might
arifte hereafter
Mi HOWARD use to p\phm lie had, on \esterday, at
tempted to explain the dtflicn i ties \hich piesented themselves
to the committee when this bill was before them Theie were
thiee gradations through which a nation must pass before it can
take its stand as an independent nation He all uded to a colo
mal government lhe fiibt step was revolt oi insurrection
The next was civil war that is, wuen an msimection has be
corne of sufficient magm'ude to entitle it to that appellation
And the third an Uast wa«, wht.n*Us independence was recog
nised by othei <*o\ernments
Now the obioct of tins bill was meiely to apply to the fnat of
these cases It wa& idnutted to be a matter of greatd fhculty to
proyide in a law in advance, any (nnditions on which the
Executive or Í ongicssshould undertake to say ptecistly when
any people parsed from the first to the second of these stages
Th<ne were certain cases where evety body would admit that a
people were in the first, and so with the «econd of these stage ,
but theie might be gi eat doubt as to the puticular time when
it passed fiom tho one to the othei With regii 1 to ihe pre
sent condition ol things m Canada nobody would believe that
a civil war was raging there
It was yet but a levolt, and theie was no telling wh' thtr it
would ever be any thm^ moje     Th^n as theie was to be dis
