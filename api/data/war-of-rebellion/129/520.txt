c No returns of an approximate date.

d Exclusive of the Georgia State troops under G. W. Smith, for which there are no returns.

e Embraces only the returns of the First and Second Sub-Districts of Texas (Hawes and Bates commanding, respectively). There are no complete returns of the department on file between January 1, 1864, and September 30, 1864. The return for the latter date is, however, unintelligibly prepared, and the usual form of abstract cannot, therefore, be compiled. It shows a "total enlisted present" of 45,927; "aggregate present," 52,867; "aggregate present and absent," 76,834.
