Governor CURTIN, Harrisburg:

I have learned this evening that McCarter's regiment has never had muskets. They are too new to go South. Let them come to Washington for the present, where guns will be furnished.

Honorable A. G. CURTIN, Harrisburg:

Can't you send Coulter to Cumberland? We need but four regiments to go South, which you have already furnished without Coulter.

HARRISBURG, November 19, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

I can't fill the regiment if ordered to Cumberland. Why not order Howell, who has not reached Huntington, or Murray, who is still at Huntindgon? Before wagons and necessities for transportation are provided we can have a regiment ready. Coulter needs three companies, and I can only get them as the regiment goes south.
