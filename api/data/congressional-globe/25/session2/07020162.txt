162_______APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,                       Feb. 1838.
25th Cono-•••2nd Sess.                       Making public officers depwitariei—Mr, Smith.                                                           Senate,
axes and burthens which they would have to bear,
that the chattering of the bank -would be productive
of the least danger to the Government. And it was
therefore a choice of evils, and not a belief in the
full and perfect constitutionality of the act, that in.
duced him to sign the act granting the charter. Mr.
Madison was clear in the opinion that the bank was
unconstitutional, and he ought to have known
whether those who gave existence to the instal-
ment at that time so understood it, and he did
know that they understood that no power was vest-
ed in Congress to establish a bank; and we histon-
cally know the fact, as well as we know that General
Washington was President of the United States
And if there was a fact to be proved now, without
looking into the Constitution to know, by construc-
tion, whether the power was to be vested in Con-
gress, would any one say that such power was
intended to be given' No one, he wis confident,
and yet we are gravely set to work to ascertain
whether that wise and intelligent body of men who
penned the Constitution did not intend to incorpo-
rate in that instrument that power. We are well
a*ured that Mr. Madison only yielded-his opinion
to what he supposed to be the voice of the people,
(a eardmal principie never to be overlooked by tin
Democracy,) who was piobably moved at that
juncture by the same impulse that General Wash
ington was when he gave his assent to it that is,
necessity or a choice ot evils, and not by the consi-
deration of its strict constitutionality Genfiat
Washington's opinion was finally m tavor of the
bank, Mr Madison's opm<on was once in lavot oi
and once against it, and General Jackson's opinion
was against it, two decisions were in favor of and
two against it. Prom that source, therefore, no
aid is to be derived by precedent or by force
of opinion. But Congress is not bound by pre-
cedent, or constrained to act upon it bo far
jtrom it, it is bound to lespect the will of the people
when it is called upon by them to act in its le-
gislative capacity, and it is, upon every pi in-
ciple, at liberty to construe the Constitution as
it is understood by it, independent of the opinions
of preceding Congresses, which undoubtedly put
such construction upon it, as it supposed was jus*
and proper at that time Nor is Oongrew bound
to follow the construction given to it by the Sitprenn
Court'they are co ordinate branches ol the f«o\ em-
inent, each branch is independent of the other m
its construction of the Constitution, as it ism ill
othci official acts, and each branch of the Govern-
ment is bound by oath to construe it as it is under-
stood by it. Although party considerations proba-
bly had no influence with the court in giving the
construction to the Constitution, yet no one expects
well settled political principles to siombei n the
mind of any patriot, however erroneous the y m \
be, without being awakened, when, in the exirn '
of an oflieial duty, he believes one course taken I v
him will prejudice the interests of In > ooiinliv,
while the other, if taken,will advance us miners,
and such high and honorable motives may be
ascribed to those high judicial functionaries, \ ' 1
those opposed to them inpolitieil principles, nith
the same sincerity and hone rabie motives, miv lie
permitted to impugn the correctness ot then (in-
struction, without doing injustice to the feelings oí
edher, or infringing or invading then rights
Mr S said, asimpoitant as all rea lily a liml
the currency of a nation to be, there seems, t > be-
too much difficulty to de'ermine in « hit pii t of the
Constitution the power lies, to entitle it to Hindi
credit, to incorporate a banking compinj, with
power to manufacture pap*r money at their plea-
sure, and to smtthejr pnvate interest. Some hate
attempted to locate it in that part of the Cons pu-
tion which authorizes Congress to "com mone>, re-
gulate the value thereof, ard of foreign com," etc
There is an obvious distinction between «rt

the power oi establishing a banking coipoiation to
make papei money, w hie h is no where recognised
m the Constitution, but was expressly rejected
w hen the Constitution was framed. Such a con-
struction would be more foiced than to say it im-

because Congress is empowered to com money,
inasmuch as the manner m which it shall
he done is not expressed, and to search aftei

Muait p-(ss]>j"-i If diej are powers derive I
from the sime source, it is no maUer whether fhe\
ne fxprp's << implied, they arc to be exercised in
the same way, and io1-the same purpose    There
can be no doubt, tin , said Mr. S. if he was cor-
rect, but if Congress has the power to incorporate a
company to carry out the implied powers, it has the
same right to incorporate a company to carry into
effect the expresa powers. Weil, admitting this to
be correct, what would be the condition of the
people and their Government? Their agents, se-
lected for their fidelity to manage the Government
tor them, have bartered it away, and transferred
the power conferred on them lor that purpose, and
by the barter and transfer have given their new
agents the character of master, instead of seivant,
which was the approptiate character xvhen elected
by the people. Congress, then, will have gianled
the power to com money, and to a corporation; the
powui to legulate commerce, construed to mean to
carry on commerce to another company, to de-
clare war to another company, and to furnish mate-
rials lot carrying it on, to another company, to fix the
standard ol xveights and measures to another com-
pany, and to bu ild our ships etc. to another company
If Congress possesses the same power to incor-
porate a company to manufacture weights and
measuies, that it does to mcorpoiate a company
to manufacture the cuirency, what more impro-
priety or injustice xvould there be to the people1
The people would not suffer a? much by it, even if
the weights and measures were to increase and
dimmish with the interest of the manufacturer,
when he bought and sold as much as the bank
bills do, because much more property can be dis-
posed of, passed from hand to hand without
weighing or measuring, than there can be without
money. Ana what would the people think, and
what would they say to their servants, if they were
to incorporate a company of men, with the exclu-
sive pavtlege of manufacturing all the weights
and measures of the country, and of using them
in their own way; and at their pleasure to dispose
of them, or withhold them, and to make them largei
when they bought, and smallei when they sold,
compelling the people to depend on the company
fni them, and must either buy of them at their
prices and on their terms, or go without'! The
cflect on the interest of the people, if the exclusive
rylit being given to an incorporated company to
manufacture the currency, in accordance with
their own interest is the same, and more deleten-
ous if possible.
Toiaiseand Mipport armies, would be necesanly
implied under the power to declare war; war could
not be carried on without this power, it is a means
of accomplishing an end, that is to maintain war,
but the means, as well as the end are here ex-
ptessed     If the convention xvlnch formed the Con-
stitution, had  intended to have given such means
as banking to accomplish an end, as is contended
lor, so remote  as the end and the means are fiom
each  other, would it not have  been much moie
likely to express the means to be employed than in
some otheis, between which  (hero was much more
aflinitv, and when it  inu't have been implied by
necessity, and  when  the means  weie absolutely
nieessaiy  to  accomplish   the  end1     The   power
vesled in Congiess " to make all laws xvhich shall
be neceisartf and propei for carrying  into execution
the  foregoing powers, and all other powers xested
by  the Constitution   in   the  Government of the
Un* ed Stales, or in anv department or office there-
of," has   some times been  selected, as the source
from whence the authority is derived to establish a
bank    This clause of the  Constitution, Mr.'S
slid, did not enlarge ihe powers already granted, it
neither did, or was intended to add fo their powers
Congress  would have possessed this powr, ne-
cessarily, as much without this clause as with it,
i' is declaratory merely , to make all such laws as
should be necessary to give lull force and effect to
tie Constitution would be a necessary consequence,
for xnthout the right to enjoy the benefit of the
constitutional power, as they are given, the Consti-
tution wonl I be wholly useless.    But if we do not
pervert the language made use of to indicate the
1 iws to be made under the above power, it is quite
certain that no authority will be found in that part
(t the Constitution to establish a bank.   What do
we understand by the words " necessary and pto-
per-2"    Why, sir, not only that the law to be
made shall be adapted, fit, prop , and apposite,
