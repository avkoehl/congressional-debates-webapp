HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Morris' House, Lamb's Ferry Road, December 26, 1864- 8 a.m.

Orders of the day for the Fourth Corps for to-day, December 26, 1864:

The corps will march as soon as rations are issued-General Kimball will lead, followed by General Elliott, then General Beatty. The only wagons that will follow divisions will be the five ammunition wagons and ambulances; all others, including headquarters and baggage wagons, will follow the ammunition of the reserve battery (after the troops). These wagons will move-first, corps headquarters; then division headquarters, in the order in which the divisions march. It will be necessary to make this disposition of trains to facilitate our march for the next two or three days.
