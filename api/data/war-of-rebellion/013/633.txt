Lieutenant Webster deserve especial mention, however. The latter was killed in the charge across the field, after having given evidence of the greatest coolness and courage and of unusual intelligence.

I am under especial obligation, too, to Major B. G. Baldwin, who had rejoined my staff and had consented to act as lieutenant-colonel of the Sixth Alabama Regiment. Acting in both capacities at intervals during the day, he showed the highest order of soldierly qualities in both.

I submit herewith all the regimental reports that have been handed in.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully,

R. E. RODES.

Brigadier-General, Commanding, &amp;c.

Major J. W. RATCHFORD, A. A. G., Hill's Division.
