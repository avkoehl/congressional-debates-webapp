that even then they had no right to roam at large through the
House of Representatives, to select here and there a subject for
their condemnation, sit in judgment on the Representatives of
the people, and interfere with the rights of the vast constitu-
ency of the countiy, (or the privileges of members of this
House are the privileges of the  constituents
But, sir, theie ought to be no difficulty about this matter
The rules of the House appear to me to be positive, direct, and
conclusive upon the subject, that, ií I did mot see and hear the
contrary, I would suppose it impossible that there should he
any controversy m the rase Now, what is the rule upon the
subject? Here it is I read what has been frequently read m
the course of this debate, from Section 11th of Jefferson's Ma
nual
"When a committee is charged with an inquiry, if &membert
prove to be involved^ they cannot proceed against him, but
must make a special report to the House; whereupon, the
member is heard m his place, or at the bar, or a special autho
my is given to the committee to ¡nquue concerning him "
Well, "ii, I have read both the resolution and the rule Now,
what does the committee dof Recollect that the resolution un
der which they were appointed neither charged nor named any
number of the House, but directed them to investigate" the
facts and circumstances, and ''inquire" as to the breach of pn
vitege Upan the veiy threshold of this "inquiry" they were
met with the fact that "members" were "involved" This*
being the case, what does the rule of the House require of the
eommtttee'i Why, not to proceed against (hem, but-ina/cea spe
cial repoi t to the House And what does the committee do?
They violate this lule They do not make a special report
They do proceed against a pai t of the members "involved,"
yes, sir, without accusing them, or notifying them that they are
on their (rial, they try them, condemn them, censure them, de
nounce punishment against them, íeport resolutions and argu
ments against them, ask this House toadopt the formei, concur
with them in the latter, and sanction a violation of one of its
most important rules—a rule founded upon an express piovi
sion in the Constitution, thus incorporated with it, ?nd becom-
ing, dunng its operative existence, as obligatory on members
as that sacred instrument itself
Is not this so? Let us see In the fifth «ection of the first ar
tide of the Constitution of the United States it is provided that
"each House may determine the rules of its proceedings " In
pursuance of this grant of power, this House at the last session,
determined the fundamental rules ui us pioceedmg&, and by
the 118th of these rules adopted Jefferson''* Manual asa pait of
their code Here they all are, the Con&ti'ution, the rule", and
Tefferson sMinual, pnntedand published and bound together
m one volume, and lurmshcd to every member by express re
solution of this House, in order that every one might know what
aie the laWs which govern our proceedings And here is the
rule which the committee has trampled upon, and which we
are invited to brush away from our regard asa "mere cobweb
of form," in order that the purposes of a mere majority oí the
committee may be carried into effect
But, sir, this is not all They have not only usurped autho
nty and trampled upon constitutional rules prohibiting their
proceeding, but have omitted todo what the lules lequired of
them They have tried condemned, censured, and denounced
a part of those "involved," at the ime time, other membeis
"involved," and one of them, at least, as deeply involved as
either of those censured, have not only beenleit untried and un
arraigned, but even unaccused Whilst they have condemned
some, they have shielded others Such rank, palpable, mon
strous injustice, I, foi one, never can and never will sanction
No, sn, I am for having the committee peiform us duty and
its whole duty X wish them to take back then report, strike
out its resolutions, pei sonal arguments, censures, and denuncia
tions, and submit the facts and circumstances and all the evi
dence Then let them repoit that their inquiry as to the breach
of privilege "involves" membeieof this House, and state the
names of all the members who are involved m the inquny
When they do this, they will comply both with the resolution
and the rule of the House, and equal and even handed justice
will be meted out alike to all
By the rule before quoted, the committee is required to re
port not those whom they adjudge gailiy or whom they con
demn, (for ihey aie prohibited from proceeding against any,)
but those who are invoiced " not one, nor two, nor thiee, but
all who are "involved "
Let them make such a report This will furnish ground of
accusation against those 'involved ' If the House or any mem
be¿ think proper, they ran then be accused before the nation,
be put upon their trial, be heatd in their defence, be judged
of by their peers, and be punished or not, accoidingly as they
are or are not guility of a b-each of f rivilege, each one accord
mg to his deceits, and as it ina> seem best to the wisdom ol the
House
But, as the matter now stands, some are already condemned,
and this condemnation, thus made in defiance oí law, we are
ealied upon to sanction, whilst we leave others equally guilty to
go scot iree I say equally guilty, for I have listened attentive
ly to the reading of the evidence, and I will defy any one to dis
crimínate between the guilt of those visited with thp rensuie of
the committee, and some of those who were prominent actors
in the sad and melancholy scene, and whom the committee have
kept entirely in the back ground
Thus, sir, it is that I maiutam tjiat the committee has been
guilty of a twofold wrong Tirst, m secrecy and silence in the
daik cells of the Capitol they have tried and condemned some
without authority, and against law and, secondly, they have
shielded others, equally guilty, even from accusation itself,
when it was their bounden duty to have "proceeded" against
none but to have reported to the Honse all who were "in
volved" Í will never confirm such a direct violation of Con
stitution and law, and such a monstious and glaring piece of
partisan, partial injustice
Sir, what have the people petitioned for? For gentlemen
have all at once grown very tender of the right of petition
When it suits their pmposes, they are ior stifling the vsice of
the people, and, without compunction or regaid, their pen
tions are trampled under foot But now, sir, when the Con
stitution lies torn and tattered beneath their feet by the action
of this committee, they stand unconcernedly amidst the frag
ments, and mock you with the exc amalion t íat the people
have petitioned ioi it'
What have they petitioned for7 Bid they ask you for the
appointment oí a partisan committee to judge and condemn
and punish some, whilst they shield from accusrtion the guilt
and impropriety of otheis? No, sir, they ask for no such
thing They call upoa the House to protect its privileges, up
hold its dignity and character, inquire i tto the whole matter,
punish all who have been suilty of a bieach of the pin ilesos
of the House, and, above all, to idopv sucn measures as will
prevent like occurrences in the iutun Ihey do not seek ven
geance for the past, but security and propriety for all time to
come
This, sir, is what I contend for, what I insist upon I call
upon thib Hi use to lap bevon 1 the contemptible trammels
oi mere party, and, beloie Heaven and the country, be juh
Now, sir, how has the report of the committee been sus
tamed, and what are th arguments opp t=ed to the v etss that
other gentlemen, m common with myself hav tal en of this
very grave question? Oie hunoiablt gentlemm fiom New

Thi3, s ,ifewhaiaconstHut on i-maV for but foi this p)0
tective quality of the "weak, a Constitutional Government would
be worthiest?'
The i ules of this House, springing from and founded upon tfwi
Constitution, ferm the code for the government of the House
and all its members These rules are at all «mes to be observed
It the House pass a resolution authorizing a committee to do
what the rules forbid, the resolution so far is roft?, unless, the
rules had been previously suspended, in the mode preiscjribfec! for
that p urpose To maintain the contrary, is to annihilate áltprO
per notions of a Constitutional Government It is unmixed, tiri*
mitigated, unrelieved despot'sm,
Bu t, as I hare said before, the rules and the resolutions cto not
conflict witlv each other There is not the least possible decree
of antipathy between them, and; therefore, whether lam right
or not in my notion of the superior influence of the rule, it ¡s of
no consequence whatever, so fai as this case is concerned,
Mr Speaker, thus positive rule, embodying as ¿tdoes the very
spn it of liberty, and clothed by our immortal Jefferson m Ian
cuage too trong and precise to be misunderstood, is astumbl Bg
block m the way of the purposes of honorable gentlemen on the
other side of the question It must be got nd of if possible
So the same honorable gentleman to whom I last alluded, ¿Mr
Loomis, 1 has stai ted anothei very grave objection to it He
insists thai even if his other objections have not entirely anm
hifated it, u deserves to be wholly disregarded by the House, be-
cause it is an ' English rule " He hsSt found out that it was
adopted itom the English Parliament Even i^e great name
of íuFtrson himself, whom the gentleman recognises as the fa-
ther of his democracy, and who intioduced the rule into our
code, cannot save it from the gentleman's condemnation1 He is
really hoi rot siiuckatit, and says if the House had onlytafcen.
time to exam ne into Jeffeison s Manual, and had kn wn that it
w is, of' Engl sh extraction," they never could have adopted it*
These being the honoia1) e gentleman s piemis.eb, his conclusion
i°¡, that the ru'es of the Houae, codifie t by the great Jeiferson
hmv-elf, tic to be ttampled upon, and the gi eat principles ofh-
herty embodied mthem contemned, because they are of "Eng-
lish extiaction '
This may be very good reasoning,, although I am too dul! to
comprehend it Let me, according to the best lights my poor
understanding can furnish, catryit out, and see where it will
lead to
What language, I a^k, does the honorable gentleman speak,
but the Engl sh language? Had he not better, in his hoiror of
the "English,"and fully and consistently to carry out his prin
ciple&, adopt the I aun, or Arabic, or some other language
most unlikf the English! Nay if his objection be good, and
his principle a^ojnd one,(andI have no doubt of his full con6
dence m it) ousrht he not immediate > to bung m a bill for the
kee¡ mgof our recouls andpioeeedinge in some foreign tonguel
And aitei that xtlvancmg ^tiíl futthei m the work he hasso
boldly begun move nesolution to expel every member from
tin House who is so unfortunate as to beat an ' English name?"
because, tor&ooth, he is of English extraction
Cobwebs anl technicalities and special pleas fndspecial de-
íruirersand to crown the whole,' Enshsh extraction'" Yes,
sit, Li gnsh extiaction' These are the arguments^ the weu-
po is, v, hich honorable gentlemen bring imo this great constitu-
tional conflict, and by which, contrary to Constitution and law,
they are to expel members fiom their seats, and depuve a por-
no  of the people, the constitutney of the country, of their rts
preventatives
Oh' but,savs another honoiable gentleman from New York,
[\It IVpker] for you perceive that New Yoric has all the
houoi of bungingmhei ' cobwebs, 'and "specia-i pieas/'and
' T ngh h exti actions," and such like argttm&nts, to the rescue
of th** committee—oh' says that gentleman, why oppose your
technical rules against the wishes of the committee? The par-
ties mtriested in this* House do not object Ianswci the hono
lable gentleman that I object' I object in the name of the Con
stitution, which 3 as been vio ated, and which I have sworn to
Mipport I object in the name of the people of the United
S uts, whose representatives, if accused, I am bouad to see
fan y fully, and impaitially tried not by a partisan committee
the cells of the Capitol, but heie, m this hall, before the
countiy, with th ir accusers meeting them 'face to face, and eye
toeye in the broad light of heaven' I object,because the pro
tee lings of the committee ha\ t been charactei ized by a disre-
gard of the ¡ule-! of the Houpg, and by a palpable par-
pai nhtj, in trying anl condemning, and stating the case
most «trongly against some, undei an assumed authoiity, and
si leldm^ under the sime authority others at least as guilty,
from accu ation and blame Foi all these reasons, I object I
st. nd upon the very threshold of the Constitution I will not
\ield an inch
But sir the "ame honorable gentlemen tell us that we op
