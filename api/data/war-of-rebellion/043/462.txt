column directed itself upon our battery to my left, and the line on the left flank of the column directly upon my position. I advanced my reserve to the picket front, and as the rebel line came within about 100 yards, w poured in a well-directed fire, which broke the rebel line, and it soon fled in the wildest confusion. Being relieved from this direction, I changed front forward on the left company, thus presenting our front to the left flank of the advancing rebel column. Our fire was poured into their flank with terrible effect for a few minutes before the Second Brigade at the battery opened, but almost instantly on the fire from the front, together with the concentrated fire from our batteries, the whole mass gave way, some fleeing to the front, some to the rear, and some through our lines, until, the whole plain was covered with unarmed rebels, waving coats, hats, and handkerchiefs in token of a wish to surrender. The Eighth pressed forward, capturing a large number of prisoners [about 200] and 3 stand of colors; one marked Thirty-fourth North Carolina and one Thirty-eighth Virginia were captured by Sergt. Daniel Miller, of Company G, and have been turned over, by order of Colonel Carroll, to the division commander. One captured by Private James Richmond, of Company F, was taken from him on the field by a staff officer of our army, but whose name is unknown. * During this time we were under a terrific fire from the rebel batteries and infantry, and my loss in all on both days is 101 killed and wounded and 1 missing, and includes 4 captains wounded, the sergeant-major wounded, 2 orderly sergeants killed and 4 wounded, 2 duty sergeants killed and 6 wounded, 9 privates killed on the field [4 since died], 52 wounded, and 1 missing. My officers and men behaved with the utmost courage and bravery, and have contributed all that could be asked of any men to the glorious results of that day. I desire to mention especially Captain William Kenny, who acted as major, and Adjt. John W. De Puy, who behaved with great gallantry, and rendered me every assistance. Captains {John Reid, Miller, Pierce, and Nickerson were all wounded while gallantly leading their companies, Captain Nickerson, it is feared, mortally, while Captain Lewis, Lieutenants O'Reilly, Farnum, Galwey, Travis, and Hysung, who were in command of companies, deserve the highest praise and credit. I have to lament the death of Lieutenant Hayden, who fell while cheering his men to the conflict. I would also mention especially the color sergeants, {James Conlan and {Romeo W. Foster, who bore our colors {which were often struck gallantly to the front during the whole of the fierce conflict. A list of the killed and wounded has already been forwarded, but several have since died, making a revised list necessary, which will be forwarded as soon as possible.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

FRANKLIN SAWYER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding,

Lieutenant J. G. REID,

Actg, Asst, Adjt. General, 1st Brig., 3rd Div., 2nd Corps.
