The CLERK. A quorum having appeared,
it is competent for this body to proceed to elect
a Speaker.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I now move that
this House proceed to tlio election of a Speaker
for the House of Representatives of the For-
tieth Congress.
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Clerk, I observe in
calling the roll—this list which I have before
me, and I presume printed by order of the
Clerk—there are sixteen absent States, six of
which have been called by the Clerk, but have
no representation upon the floor of this House,
and ten of which, although upon the list, have
not been called by the Clerk.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I rise to a point of
order, dint no debate is in order until after the
House proceeds to the election of its officers.
The CLERK. The Clerk overrules the point
of order, the previous question not having been
called.
Mr. BROOKS. The same question was
made at the organization of the previous
House, and the same decision was then made
by the Clerk.
Mr. Clerk, there are sixteen States absent,
and twenty States are about to proceed to the
organization of this House in the midst of a
crisis, ay, in the midst of a revolution—civil I
hope it is to be—the very gravest it has ever been
the fortune, or the misfortune of our country
rather, to pass through. Of the original States,
there are now absent, of the thirleeu original
States which framed the Constitution of the
United States, the work of our fathers—seven
of these original thirteen have no Representa-
tives upon the floor of this House.
My attention has been called to the fact there
are precedents which authorize not alone this
extra, but this very extraordinary convocation
of the Congress of the United States; but there
are no precedents in our political history which
justify the assembling and organization of this
I House while so large a number of States are
absent, and with so short a notice given to the
absent States with the power and right to be
represented hero.
I have here before me a list of the cases
showing when each Congress has assembled.
It is as follows: on first Monday in January.
1790; on fourth Monday in October, J7ill; on
first Monday in November, 1792; on first, Mon-
day in November, 170-1; on first Monday in
November, 1797; changed to second Monday
in November, 1797; on third Monday in No-
vember, 1800; on first Monday in November,
1803; on first Monday in November, 1804; on
first Monday in November, 1808; on fourth
Monday in May, 1809; on fourth Monday in
November, 1809; on first Monday in Novem-
ber, 1812; on fourth Monday in May, 1013;
on first Monday in December, 1813; on last
Monday in October, 1814; on third Monday in
November, 1818; on second Monday in No-
vember, 1820.
Tt, will be found on examination even in the
trying crisis of the war of 1812, when the
whole world seemed to be let loose on our
country, that our fathers of that day did not
venture to convoke the Congress of the United
States without giving all of the States full time
and full power to be represented. The short-
est period of notice which was ever given was
during the war of 1812 under the act of Feb-
ruary 27, 1813, when three months notice was
given for the assembling of Congress, not as
now a brief notice of one mouth and nine
days. When the notice was thus given to the
people and the States of the United States,
the boundaries of our States extended only
from the Chattahoochee, m Georgia, to the
Passamaquoddy, in Maine. The boundaries
of the Republic have since been greatly ex-
tended until our vast domain reaches from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, a breadth of territory,
avastness of population, which it is impossible
for the notice which has been given for the
convocation of this Congress to have reached
in one month and nine days.
Mr. KELLEY. Will the gentleman yield
for a question.
Mr. BROOKS. Certainly.
Mr. KELLEY. I ask him whether at that
time the present railroad and telegraph system
of the country was in operation ? [Laughter, j
