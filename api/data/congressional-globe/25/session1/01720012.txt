25th Cong....1st Sfss.                                 Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Wright.                                                    Senate.   *
Still, it would be seen by the Senate, that this
disposition of the funds in the Treasury, and of the
public credit, would leave the Treasury without a
dollar to answer the current demands upon it The
appropriations foi the year were large, almost be-
yond example, and the current calls upon the pub-
lic Treasury must be measured by them. Hence
it had been an object oí primary interest with the
Secretary to devise the means for carrying on the
Government, and fulfilling its obligations to the
public creditors, and in reaching that object he had,
as he Mr. W considered, wisely and properly, sus-
pended his efforts, to make this last transfer to the
States. In pursuance of this necessity, he had to'd
Congress, m his printed report, that he should make
no movements towards the accomplishment of that
object, until the action of Congress should signify
its will that that transfer should still be made, and
should provide the means for making it These
facts and conclusions weie fully before the com-
mittee
It then became necessary for them to see what
would be the state of the puhhc Treasury, upon the
supposition that the October instalment of the de-
posite with the States should be withheld In pio-
secutmg that inquiry, they found that the funds in
the Treasury, subject to draft, were, to so great an
extent, unavailable, that it would be indispensably
necessary to resort to the use of the ciedit of the
Government, in some form, (o anticipate the practi-
cal use of the unavailable portions of those funds
for the purpose of current payments
At this stage of the inquiry, two other important
interests, both public and private in their character,
pressed themselves upon the attention of the com-
mittee. In any settlement with the late deposite
banks, which should have pioptr regard to the pre-
sent deranged and depressed state ot the business
of the country, and to the secuntyof the public
moneys yet remaining m their possession, the com-
mittee were forced to the conclusion that indul-
gence to these institutions, beyond their legal liabi-
lities, was indispensable The conclusions of the
committee upon this point had been embodied in
the shape of a bill, and was now before the Se-
nate m a printed form. The other great interest to
■which he referred was a similar indulgence upon
the revenue bonds. There, also, the committee had
reported a bill which was before the body In both
-cases, the least indulgence had been proposed, which
the committee believed to be consistent w th the
gieat pnvate w'erests of the community, or the
securny of lhe public property iniclved They
had been induced to believe, tint the time gralited
to the banlis was the least v. bich would en;ble them
to meet the payments m the minner lequired by
law, and that any dependence upon a more speedy
collection of the merchants' bonds would result
in disappointment to the public Treasury, and a
consequent failure to pay the pnblic creditors
It being a1 «timed that Congress would agree with
ti e committee in t\iese conclusions, and that these
bills would meet with approbation, what then
w ould be the state ol the Treasury with íeference
to a transfei of the October instalment to the States'?
Mr. W. said he understood the estimates of the De-
partment tobe, that without these indulgences to the
banks and the merchants, and with the postpone-
ment of the October instalment of the transfer to
the States, the whole means in the Treasury might
be adequate to its wants, in case Congress should
be willing to grant the use oí the pubLc «edit tem-
porally, that that portion of the funds which
■were at present unavailable might be brought into
practical use, until time should íendm them avail-
able for the redemption of that ciedit If those in-
dulgences should be granted, then the use of the
public credit would be requited beyond the current
year, because material portions oí the existing
means, and of the otherwioe acciumg revenue,
•would be placed w ltbout t'-e reach or control of the
Treasury for more than that period
Upon these calculations and hypotheses the bills
of the committee had been framed, and it was now
his duty to give these facts and conclusions practi-
cal application to the measure undei discussion
This was a bill to postpone the October instal-
ment of the transfer to the States If he had been
correct, m his statements, and had made himself in-
telligible to the Senate, it would be seen that nothing
existed in the Treasury out of which this transfer
could be made, and that nothing within its power
could enable it to make it without the aid of Con-
gress It would also be seen that the whole means
of the Treasury were inadequate to meet the cur-
rent calls upon it without the temporaiy aid of the
credit of the nation, and that, if a reasonable indul-
gence were granted to public debtors, (such as the
condition of the countiy and the security of even-
tual collections seemed to demand,) the use of that
credit must extend beyond the cunent year, and
could, at best, be only eventually met and redeemed
by the means of the Treasury, existing, cr m pros-
pect, without a further transfer to the States
In view of these facts, Mr W said his own
mind had been brought to this simple and plain
conclusion that the United States had no longer
any moneys to be safely kept by the States, that if
the October instalment of the transfer irovided for
by the deposite law of 1836 was made, the means
to make it must be borrowed upon the credit of the
United States, and that Congress must place itself
m the singular position of using the public credit
to borrow money, merely that it might be safely
kept by the States when it was obtained He un-
derstood these provisions of the deposite law, upon
their face, to be mere provisions for the safe-
keeping of the public money. He understood this
to be the object of those who advocated and sup-
poited that law at the time of its passage. In that
sense he was disposed to regard it now, and he did
not, therefore, view it as creating any claim in
favor of the States, or as imposing any debt upon
the United States If, therefoie, we were called
upon to borrow money to fulfil the provisions of
that law, he could only view it m the light of a
call upon us to borrow money, merely that it
might be salely kiptwhen so boirowcd He had
not felt, and could not feel, himself authorized to
recommend a loan upon the credit of the nation
for such a purpose. He believed he spoke the sen-
timents of those ®f his colleagues upon the commit-
tee, when he said that these were the views which
had actuated him and them m consenting to report
this bill.
Mr W. said he owed it to himself to say that
he had felt most sensibly the remarks of the honora-
ble Senator from Massachusetts (Mi Webster) as
to the inconveniences and disappointments which
must glow out of withholding the transfer of this
instalment to the Slates With a much less know-
ledge of the varied business and pecuniary
affairs of our extended country than that distin-
guished Senator, he had not been insensible to these
considerations The course pursued by his own
State, in the disposition of this money, had com-
pelled him to be awake to them The law ef his
State for the investment of its portion of this mo-
ney had placed the m-itter even beyond its control,
and had compelled its chief fiscal officer, long
since, to announce to its citizens that this instal-
ment would be paid from the treasury of the
State., whatever might be the action of Congress
upon the subject This would, beyond doubt,
be done, and those who sent him here, and
whom it was his duty and desire faithfully
to lepresent, should this bill jiass, would be
compelled to indemnify, fiom their own public
funds, the individuals interested as borrowers
of these moneys, against disappointment, damage,
or loss, from the ac ion of Congress Yet, under
these delicate and difficult circumstances, he had
not been able to convince himself that he could pro-
perly do otherwise than to support the bill He
owed a hism duty to those constituents, but he
owed, m his estimation, a higher to the nation
and to the Constitution of his country. Hecouldnot
think that the power granted to Congress to borrow
money upon the credit of the United States could
be properly exercised, for the mere purpose of
raising money to be safely kept, and this he must
consider the simple question presented He might
be mistaken in this view of the matter, but such
■«as the deliberate conclusion of his mind, upon
the most mature reflection, and that conclusion
must govern his action upon the bill, as it had done
his action as a member of the committee which re-
ported it
Having said thus much, Mr W said, he would
only correct two or ihiee errors of fact into which
the honorable Senator who had jui.t resumed his
seat (Mr. Webster)seemed to him to have fallen,
and he would detain the Senate no longei
The honorable Senatoi seemed to suppose that
the means to make this transfer to the States were in
the Treasury, and that the only difficulty, separate
from the other demands upon it, grew out of the
present unavailable character of those means.
The statements he had already made, had shown
the error of this hypothesis He had already shown
that the whole means in the Treasury, even when
the Secretaiy of the Tieasury made his report, at
the commencement of our present session, of
whatever charactei whethei available or not,
were less, by more than a million of dollars,
than the instalment required to be transferred to the
States under the deposite law He had further
shown that those means, such as they were, were,
before the fiist oí October, when that transfer was
required to be made, to be still further diminished
by the whole expenses of the Government for the
present month, ascertained and estimated to amount
to two and a half millions of dollars Hence it
would follow, that the whole means in the Treasury
on the first day of October next, must be from three
and a half to four millions less than the tiansfer
required It was in vain, therefore, Mr W said,
to escape from the conclusion, that if Congress
should insist upon this transfer, it must authorize a
loan of money upon the public credit, to enable
the Treasuiy to make it in other w ords, that it
must authorize a loan of money upon the credit of
the United States, that that money, when loaned,
may be deposited with the States for safe keeping.
Another error of the honorable senator (Mr.
Webster) which he felt bound to correct, was in
his strictures upon the recommendations of the
Secielary of the Treasury, as to the manner of is-
suing treasury notes The honorable senator had
criticised this part of the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury with some seventy, and had held him
up to the Senate and the country as striking out a
new path for the supply of the Treasury, as recom-
mending the issue of paper money, of a descrip-
lion of paper similar to that which we know by the
denomination of "continental money," and of do-
ing this for the first time since the organization of
the Govt rnment under the Constitution. The fault
complained of consisted in a recommendation,
merely discretional y and alternative, to issue Trea-
sury notes bearing no interest, and payable to *he
berrer, in case the public creditors shou'd be found
willing to receive such notes m payment of their
demands against the Government, at par, other-
wise, to give the notes such an interest as would
bring them to par
Mr W said as the committee, m the bill they
had reported, had not followed this recommenda-
tion of the Secretary, it would be seen that no ques-
tion was depending before the Senate, either in the
bill now under discussion, or in any other, which
rendered this point material, but he was sure his
object would be fully understand and appreciated
in making this correction. It was simply to dpfend
this public officer against a mistaken accusation It
was not necessary for him to defend, at this time,
the soundness of the recommendation, but to pro-
tect the Secretary against the charge of being the
author of a principle now supposed to be so new
and so dangerous To do this, it was only neces-
sary for him to read the third section of the act of
the 21th oí Febiuary, 1815, authorizing an emis-
sion of Treasury notes, m which all these dangers
would be found to be embraced, adopted, and made
imperative, as a pari of the laws of the land.
[Mt. W. here read the section of the act, as
follows
" Sec 3 <And be %t further enacted, That the said
Treasuiy notes shall be piepared of such denomi-
nations as the Secretary of the Treasury, with the
approbation of the President of the United States,
shall, from time to time, direct, and such of the
said notes as shall be of a denomination less than
one hundred dollars shall be payable to bearer, and
be tiansferrabk by delivery alone, and shall bear no
interest; and such of the said notes as shall be of
; the denomination of one hundred dollars, or up-
