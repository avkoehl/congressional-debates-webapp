ment now introduced covertly to enhance ih
amount of the du'y, and with ih- certain effect of
pr ducmg inequality of duties, virjirg ail over
the Union, but inevitably highest m the South, to
tie great injury of Southern importing cine , and
in flagiant violaron of the Constitution This is
our new tariff—the Land bill tariff—the Southern
tariff' an-from which, and all such, may the
Lord deliver the country !
Believe the States is the language of gen*!emen
They vote for this bill to relieve the Siates. This
is their plea, and they say the S'ates gave up the
great sources ot revenue—the lands and die cus-
toms—to the Federal Government aid now it is
but right tha' the Federal Government shou'd re-
turn to them, in thtir distres , the land part of this
revenue And why not the custom-house part
also' The argument is just as good for one branch
of the reveme as the other, but it is good for
neither' foi it is forbid by the Cons>itution, and
forbid by reason The Constitunon reclaims all
this revenue for Federal purposes, an 1 n re< eivmg
it, the Federal Government also a^su nci all the
great subjects of Sta'e expenditure It assumed
¡11 the expenses of the Federal Government, leleas-
Mg the State  from ihe pay of their own members
of Congress; all tha expenses oí foreign and Indian
intercourse, all the expanses of foreign wars and
domestic insurrections, alt the expenses of protec
tiou to the Sta cs at home, and th°ir commerce
abroad, all the expense1., m short, of armies and
navies ship , forts and cannon, and the number-
hss expenses of a National Government. All this
the Federal Government assumed when it was re-
ceiving from the Sta'es the customs and the lards
It did more it assumed the Stale deb & and the
foreign debts at the same lime; and has paid them,
and paid them out of the customs' and now the
gentlemen wish to revoke one br?rsch of this reve-
me, and  tll leave all the burdens on the Fede-
ral Government which both the lands and the
customs weie to bear. Ilus will never do. Jus
tice and the Constitution foibid it. The public
defences now require aoove a hundred rsulltons,
and that vast burden must not fall upon com-
merce. I tell the gentleman from Vir<' aia who
has brought forward ih's argument, [Mr. Aacmcrt,]
that it is a bad argument, and the worse becau e it
j  of foreign origin, ai d was used by the Brnish
capitalist* m favoi of tha Federal avsump*ion of
S ate debts, before i' was used by the land revenue
distributors on this S'de of the v,at=r This I
showed in this chamber tit the eommeneerrer t of
the last session, wh n the present Sect lary of
S ate, [Mr. Webstfr ] t en a member of thi
body, used the same argument in favor of the land
distribution 1 told him ihen it was a forei-m ai
gumem, derived from British capitalists; ?nd I
read him i he chapter in a Briti'h biok upon the
State debts, and Ihe necssdy of their assumption
bv the Federal Government, vvhieh provd it I
deem the gentleman fiom Virginia pirticularly
unfortunate in giving us a new edition of this fo-
reign argument, especially after it had once before
mads its appearance on this fl or, ardhal"been
expelled from it
Wrong in U.e argument, and in the reison,
the gentleman is still more wrong in the f ct of
the relief itself This is already pretiy wvll shown
in showing that the new Tariff bill is to ioibw the
Land bill—that the Trtasuiy is to be emptie i with
one hand, and filled with the other—that eight o
ten millions are to be put in, to supply the loss ot
three or four taken out—that these eight or ten
millions are to cost the people flf'e<*n or twen'j—
and, in place of a land revenue, derived volunta
nly from 'and purchasers, we subiti'ute um/er^al
taxation upr n the comforts and neces^ mes of life,
reaching every family, and falling upon ihem with
the accumulated burthens of horns valuation,
ready money duties, wholesale and retail tner
caadle pirfir, and cost oí collection, until «hat is
twenty to the Government becomei fifty to the
consumer We have shown this, and in showing
it, have shown the folly and absurdity of this idea
of relief. We have exploded the idea ot rel ef,
but a closer view remains still to be tafo-n—a view
that will show the practical working of this falla-
cious idea.   The vrfw is this-   In the first place
tl eie is a cheat m ihe idea— n tru. vtry conception
ot the thing The i.ird rtvmus is tu go o ihe
S ales in their corporate capacity, and ihe taxes are
to fall uponthepeup'ein the rmdividualcapacities
The relief and the bur.h ns are not to go together
The land revenue goes to the States, and from
the States either goes to British jabbers and capi-
talists to ra se above pai the stocks which tneir arts
have sunk far below par; or goes into banks at
home, to become the prey of speeu'ator*, or is ad-
ventured in *ome qui s'ionable enterprise, to become
tie source ot new deb's, and new taxes upon the
people. This is the way the laid revenue will go
the people will never ncei vea  h II" gofa' Wo*',
how will ihe taxes go which are to supply the place
of this land revenue'? Wh«ri. will these taxes go?
Straight as a Une to the shouldeis of the people '
and Ih us trace it— we it m the detail of a few
articles, as a sample of all the rtst, and as h best
mode of ascertaining ihe practical working of this
new Tariff bill It has been alteady sho vn that
under the g'onons admin «nations of Jnck^on and
V<m Burtn, seventj-siv millions cf our importa-
tions had become free of duty, and f< urleen mil-
lions more had beecme nearly free—paying but
from five to fitieen per centum on the foreign cost
All this, f moun ing to ninety vnillicn of ímpcrta-
t ons, are now to oe subpettd to tax, and let ns
tf ke a few irtiele^, and trace the workings of the
tax upsi1 'h m I will tike two article*—common

duties The banket, under tie n«w bill, is to pay
the twenty per centum on the value of the article
at the place to which impor'ed, which, in New
York, may add twenty per centum to the value; in
Richmond thirty per centum, in Charleston forty;

wards i f tbir y Ihen eomes the cas'i payment of
this duty, which is an advance of money adven-
tured in trade by the merchant, and on which he
must have his mercantile profit After that comes
pr >fit upon the whole—first, to the wholesale mer-
chant, and then to the reuder, and, in addition to
the whole, comes ten per centum to the custom-
house oficers (all expenses included) for the cost
ot collei tion; so ihit by ihe tune the blanket gets to
the bed of ihe laborer, he has paid from fifty to
seventy five per centum tax upon if, and that to
enable the Government to receive twenty per cent-
um Such are tbe workings of taxation, and of
taxation under this new tariff, which is brought
upon us by Southern votes—vo es from that quar-

So much for blankets- Now f r «a't Here is a
New York and a New Orleans price current- they
sco a you that salt is v,ili ed about double as high
m e?eh of these ports ab it costs where made, and
in New O leans just twenty five percent, higher
th^n in New York. This will double the duty m
one place, and more than double it in the other.
With a'l the trimmings of home valuation, ready-
money dutj, <o ttf cMlectnn, wholesale and re-

i tbe South and Soui iwest, must be at last one
