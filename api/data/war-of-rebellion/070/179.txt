against us from Antietam Creek. During yesterday 600 of General Stahel's cavalry advanced against the enemy from Pleasant Valley, through Solomon's Gap, and met the enemy on the west side of Elk Ridge Mountain, about five miles from here. For to-day I ordered General Stahel with his whole cavalry, and with the 200 artillery armed as infantry, and four pieces of artillery from Pleasant Valley, to move to Rohrersville. Our lines on the north of our position are engaging the enemy now. An immense train of the rebels was yesterday in sight near Shepherdstown. Prisoners taken were of the Twenty Georgia Regiment.

MARYLAND HEIGHTS, MD., July 7, 1864-2 p. m.

(Received 6 p. m.)

The following information received I deem reliable: Early commands the raiding force, composed of four divisions-Gordon's division, Rodes', and Ramseur's. The cavalry is commanded by Major-General Ransom, composed of McCauslend's mounted infantry, Jones' and Jenkins' cavalry. Two divisions infantry are in my immediate front toward Sharpsburg. Four divisions are on opposite side of Potomac River. Prisoners taken belong to Evans', formerly Hays', brigade, in Early's old division. There is no doubt about the enemy concentrating against us. A prisoner saw Early, Breckinridge, and Gordon together yesterday. All disposable troops should be sent here, my troops consisting of over two-thirds of 100-days' men.

The following report from my advance just received:

ANTIETAM BRIDGE, MD.,

Five Miles from Maryland Heights, July 8, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Major-General SIGEL:

I engaged the enemy's rear guard of cavalry at this place, and we command the bridge. The enemy's main force took the Boonsborough road leading to the right of John Brown's school-house. I have only forty cavalry at this place, and cannot advance, as the enemy seems to be in force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. FREY,

Captain.

Major-General.
