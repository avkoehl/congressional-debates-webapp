- in 'defense of the Government forced upon him.
He could but perform this duty, or surrender the
existence of the Government. No compromise
by public servants could in this case be-a cure;
not that compromises are not often proper, but
that* no popular Government can long survive a
marked precedent that those who carry an elec-
tion can only save the Government from imme-
diate destruction by giving up the main point
upon which the people gave the election. The
people themselves, and not their servants, can
safely reverse their own deliberate decisions.
As a private citizen, the Executive could not
have consented that these institutions shall per-
ish; much less could he, in betrayal of so vast
and so sacred a trust as these free people have
confided to him. He felt that he had no moral
right to shrink, or even to count the chances of
his own life, in what might follow. In full view
of his great responsibility, he has, so far, done
what he has deemed his duty. You will now,
.according to your own judgment,perform yours.
He sincerely hopes that your views and your
action may so accord with his as to assure all
faithful citizens who have bceji disturbed in their
rights of a certain and speedy restoration to them,
under the Constitution and the laws.
And having thus chosen our course, without
guile and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust
in God, and go forward without fear and with
manly hearts. 1 „

Report of tile Secretory off the Treasury.
Treasury Department, July 4, 1861.
Sir: The Secretary of the Treasury isrequired
by law to prepare and lay before Congress, at the
commencement of every session, a report on the
subject of finance, containing estimates of the
public revenue and public expenditures, and plans
for improving- and increasing the revenue.
This duty, always important and responsible,
is now rendered doubly important and responsi-
ble by the peculiar circumstances under which the
present session of Congress is held.
A vast conspiracy against the union of the
States, and the very existence of the national
Government, which has been gathering strength
and preparing hostilities in sccret for many years,
has at length broken out into flagrant violence,
and has assumed proportions so serious that an
extraordinary exertion of the public force, cre-
ating extraordinary demands upon the. public re-
sources, is required for its speedy and complete
discomfiture and suppression.
In the judgment of the Secretary, the clearest
understanding of the actual condition of the public,
finances, and of the measures demanded by its
exigencies, will be obtained by considering the
whole subject under the following general heads:
I. The balance arising from the receipts and ex-
penditures of the fiscal year 18G1, endinjf on the
30th of June.
J I. The demands upon the Treasury, arising
under existing appropriations or created by the
new exigencies, for which provision is to be made
during the fiscal year 1802.
111. The best ways of providing for these de-
mands, and the means available for that purpose.
I. Receipts and Expenditures.

For the Navy Depaitmont  30,009,520 29
In the aggregate $217,168,850 15
In addition to these demands upon the Treas-
ury, it will be necessary to provide for the re-
demption of Treasury notes due and maturing to
the amount of $12,639,861 64, and for the pay-
ment of inteiest on the public debt, to be created
during- the year, whic-h, computed fur the average
of six months, may be estimated at $9,000,000.
The whole amount required for the liscal year
1862, may therefore be thus stated:

Making a total sum lequircd by existing
appiopriations and new exigencies of...$318,5)9,581 87
III. Ways and .Means.
To provide the Urge suras required for ordinary
expenditure and by the existing emcigency, it is
quite apparent that duties on imports, the chief
resource for ordinary disbursements, will not be
adequate.
Tlie deficiencies of revenue, whether from im-
ports or other sources, must necessarily be sup-
plied from loans; and the problem to be solved is
that of so proportioning the former to the latter,
and so adjusting the details of both, that the whole
amount needed may be obtained with certainty,
with due economy, with the least possible incon-
venience, and with the greatest possible incidental
benefit to the people.
The Secretary has given to this important sub-
ject the best consideration which the urgency of
varied public duties has allowed, and now submits
to the consideration of Congress, with great def-
erence and no little distrust of his own judgment,
the conclusions to which he has arrived.
He is of the opinion that not less than eighty
million dollars should be provided by taxation,
and that $240,000,000 should be sought through
loans.
It will hardly be disputed that in every sound
system of finance, adequate provision by taxation
for the prompt discharge of all ordinary demands,
for the punctual payment of the interest on loans,
and for the creation of a gradually increasing fund
for the redemption of the principal, is indispens-
able. Public credit can only be supported by
public faith, and public faith can only be main-
tained by an economical, energetic, and prudent
administration of publicaffairs, and by the prompt
and punctual fulfillment of every public obliga-
tion.
It has been already stated that the appropria-
tions for the ordinary expenditures of the fiscal
year 1802, including the permanent and indefinite
descriptions, amount to $65,887,849 34, and the
interest to be paid on the debt to be incurred dur-
ing the year has been estimated at $9,000,000;
making an aggregate of ordinary expendituies
of §74,887,849 34. If to these sums be added
§5,000,000, as a provision for the reduction and
final extinguishment of the public debt, the total
sum will be $79,887,849 34. To provide for these
payments, at least, it is proposed, in accordance
with the principle just stated, to raise, by taxa-
tion, the sum of not. less than §80,000,000.
In considering the choice of means to insure a
revenue adequate to the purposes just indicated,
the attention of the Secretary has been necessarily
drawn to the different modes of taxation author-
ized by the Constitution.
The choice is limited to duties on imports, di-
rect taxes, and internal duties or excises.
Duties on imports constitute the chief form of
indirect taxation. Direct taxes include capitation
taxes, taxes on real estate, and probably general
taxes on personal property included in lists em-
bracing all descriptions and valued by a uniform
rule, while under the head of internal duties or
excises may be included all taxes on consump-
tion, and tuxes on particular descriptions of per-
sonal property, with reference to the use rather
than value.
The principal advantages of a system of direct
taxes are found in the sensibility with which they
are felt and observed; in the motives thence aris-
ing for economy and fidelity in administration;
and in the manifest equity of distributing burdens
in proportion to means, rather than in proportion
to consumption. On the other hand, the advant-
ages of indirect taxation, by duties on imports,
arc found in economy of collection, in facility of
payment, in adaptability to the encouragement of
industry, and, above all, in the avoidance of Fed-
eral interference with the finances of the States,
whose main reliance for revenue for all objects of
State administration must, necessarily, be upon
levies on property.
^ These considerations have doubtless determined
the preference which has always been evinced by
the people of the United States, as well as by their
Legislature and Executive, for duties on imports
as the chief source of national revenue. Only oil
occasions of special exigency has resort been" had
to direct taxation, or to'internal duties or excises.
No departure is proposed by the Secretary from
: the line of policy thus sanctioned. He ventures
j to recommend only such modifications of the c-x-
j isting tanfi as will produce the principal part of
i the needed revenue, and such resort to direct taxes
1 or internal duties or excises as circumstances may
require, in order to make good whatever deficiency
may be found to exist.
That the present tariff of duties will not pro-
duce the revenue required by sound principles of
finance, under existing circumstances, is a propo-
sition which will command general assent. It
