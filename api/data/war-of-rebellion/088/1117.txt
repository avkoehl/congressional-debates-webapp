CITY POINT, VA., September 30, 1864.

Honorable E. M STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Warren attacked and carried the enemy's line to-day on the extreme right, capturing a number of prisoners. He immediately prepared to follow up his success. Petersburg paper of to-day has a rumor, which it says is not confirmed, that one brigade of Sheridan's cavalry was ambushed and destroyed at Swift Run Creek. Early was to have attacked General Sheridan at Mount Sidney on the 28th.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General HALLECK,

I have heard no firing yet this morning. Before daylight I went up to Deep Bottom and found all quiet there. General Meade moved Rosser's brigade of cavalry has gone to join Early. The brigade numbers about 1,400 horses. Yesterday an infantry force left Petersburg in the Lynchburg cars. It may be, however, they are going via Burkeville to Richmond. Nothing heard from Sheridan through southern sources since Tuesday evening.

(Received 9.30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

A refugee from Richmond just come into General Butler's lines says the greatest consternation is felt in the city, and citizens generally are anxious that the city should be evacuated by the military. No further new from Sheridan is reported. I think lack of supplies is forcing him back.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
