with them many new duties and responsi-
bilities to the statesman. Among them not
the least important is that of providing for the
universal education of the people. In vain
shall we congratulate ourselves on the advance-
ment of the great principles of civil and polit-
ical liberty which this terrible war has wrought
unless we consolidate and secure them_on the
essential foundation of the popular intelligence.
How this vital object can be best accomplished
is a problem difficult to be solved ; but it must
be solved, or the national liberties will be im-
periled—perhaps perish. As a contribution,
or at least a suggestion toward such a solutiou,
I some time since introduced a bill for the
division of the proceeds of the sales of the
public lands among the several States for
educational purposes. As it is short I will
venture to read it:
A bill to appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the
public lands of the United States for educational
purposes.
Be it enacted, by the Senate and IJoutt of Iiepretent-
alivetn/lhe UnitedStotes of America in Congrem asoem-
H,d, That from and after December 31,1870, the net
proceeds of all the salesofall thepubliclands of the
United States, wherever situated, which shall be sold
subsequent to the said December 31,1870, shall bo
divided among the thirty-seven States of the Union
according to their respective federal population, ns
the same shall be ascertained by the census of 1370,
to beapplied by the Legislatures of the saidState3 to
such objects ofeducation as the said Legislatures may
severally designate and authorize: Provided, That
nothing herein contained shall be construed to the
prejudice of future applications fur a reduction of
the price of the public lands, or to the prejudice of
applications for a transfer of the public lands on
reasonable terms to theStateg within which they lie,
nor to impair the power of Congress to make such
future disposition of the public lands, or any part
thereof, as it may see fit: And provided farther. That
the power is here reserved of assigning by law to any
new State which shall be admitted into the Union
the proportion to which such State may be entitled,
upon the principles of this act.
Sbc. 2. And be it further enacted. That the said pro-
ceeds of sale of said public landsshall be paid at the
Treasury of the United States, half yearly, to such
person or persons as the respective Legislatures of
the said States may authorize and direct.
Ssc. 3. And be it further enacted. That the division
aforesaid of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands is made upon the express condition that in the
application and use thereof by the said States no
discrimination shall be made against any citizen of
said States on account of his race, oolor, or previous
condition of servitude, but that every citiien of every
such State, without distinction of race, color, or pre-
vious condition of servitude, shall be equally enti-
tled to avail himself of the use and benefit of what-
ever disposition of said proceeds of sale any such
State shall make for educational purposes; and the
Legislatures of said States, respectively, shall cause
to be made, on the 31st day of December, 1871, and
annually thereafter, areport to the Congress of the
United States of the application by said States, re-
spectively, of said proceeds of sale received by said
States, respectively, in such manner and formasshall
be prescribed by the Commissioner of Education, or
asshall be otherwise required by law.
Mr. President, the .number of acres of public
lands sold last year was:
Acret.
For cash, with small amoant of military
scrip    2,899,554
Location of bounty land warrants  419,780
Homestead entries under acts of 1862,1861,
and 1866  2,737,365
By agricultural college serip, under act of
July 2.1862  352,664
Certified for railways and wagon roads  746,769
Approved to States as swamps, &o., and
selected as indemnity  455,768
Located with Indian scrip     24,259
Aggregate    7,666,159
There remain yet unsurveyed 1,826,430,648
acres. Allowing that only one fourth of these
lands is of a character that would secure their
purchase and settlement, it would still present
the basis of an immense sum ultimately to come
into the Treasury.
The aggregate sales of the public lands for
the fiscal year ending June 80,1869, amounted
to the sum of $4,472,886 28. The expenses
were abont $453,816 43, leaving a net balance
of some $3,919,070. This divided among the
States uccording to the principles of the bill
which I Have read would give to each congres-
sional district (if the bill apportioning repre-
sentation which recently passed the House of
Representatives should become a law) the sum
of about ten thousand six hundred dollars.
Estimating the sales to average the same rate
in the future, the passage of this bill would
secure to each State annually at least the sum
of $10,000 for every congressional district in it.
Such a provision alone would seem inadequate
to accomplish any great result; but it would
greatly aid the States, and doubtless stimulate
them to make additional provisions for educa-
tional purposes.
Mr. President, we have just introduced into
the body-politic a race more than four millions
in number; introduced them, with small ex-
ceptions, from a condition of slavery, with all
its consequent ignorance and moral debase-
ment. This race in 1860 was distributed as
follows:
Alabama  437,770
Arkansas Ill, 259
California  4,068
Connecticut  8,627
Delaware  21,(>26
Florida  62,677
Georgia  465,698
Illinois -  7.628
Indiana  Il,4i8
Iowa  1,069
Kansas  627
Kentucky  236,167

New Hampshire  494
New Jersey    25,336

North Carolina  361,522
Ohio  36,673
Oregon  128
Pennsylvania  56,949
Rhode Island  3.952

Tennessee    283,019
Texas  182,921
Vermont  709
Virginia and West Virginia  548,907
Wisconsin      1,171
Making the aggregate of colored population
in the united States in 1860, 4,427,067. The
number is, doubtless, now increased. We may,
I think, reasonably conclude that of this num-
ber of colored people seven hundred thousand
have been made voters by the fifteenth consti-
tutional amendment, each one of them wielding
as muck political power, so far as the ballot is
involved, as any other voter. And yet we must
recognize the maxim that popular intelligence
is the principal security of civil and political
liberty. Our duty, therefore, demands that this
dangerous element, which we have introduced
into our political system, should be remedied.
This race mustbe educated. This mass of ignor-
ance must be removed. The emergency rises
above mere considerations of expediency or
philanthropy. It assumes the imperative char-
acter of an absolute political necessity. It is
not a question of benevolence alone; it is a
question of self-preservation.
And then, sir, the education of this race so
as to enable them properly to assume and to
discharge the responsibilities and duties which
we have imposed upon them is a matter of the
highest obligation due from us to them. They
have a right to demand it. Their ignorance is
no fault of theirs. Their emancipation was our
act. We are responsible for their ignorance;
we are responsible for their enfranchisement;
and therefore it is our duty to qualify them
to meet the demands of the position in which
we have placed them. And in this, as in all
matters of justice and right, it will be found
that duty and interest are in harmony.
Sir, by the thirteenth amendment of the Con-
stitution we made the African race in this
couhtry freedmen. By the fifteenth amend-
ment they were nominally made freemen; but
they can never be freemen in fact until they
are" elevated above the ignorance and demor-
alization of slavery, where enfranchisement
foundthem. He only is truly enfranchised who
votes intelligently as well as freely. Ignorance
is not only "the mother of superstitionit is
the parent of vice, the toy ot demagogues, and
the tool of tyrants. And there is groat reason
to fear that if the colored race is left without
the advantages of a better education than they
can supply themselves their history wiii exem-
plify the parable of the man in the Scriptu-es
outof whom the devils were casf, and whose last
condition was worse than the first. Those of
us who are now congratulating ourselvt.-s that
the advancing column of liberty and prog-ess
has been strengthened and reenforced by this
new accession of suffrage may live to deplore
our mistake unless speedy measures are adopted
for the education and enlightenment of these
recruits of freedom. Gratitude to their bene-
factors, and the hatred of their enemies may
bind them to us for a season; but the former
will become weakened as the cause of it be-
comes more remote in the past, and when the
passions of the latter subside, policy will sug-
gest that more can be accomplished by using
them for party and sinister purposes than by
persecuting them.
If the friends of freedom and equality before
thelaw would consolidate their triumph letthem
educate the negro. Declaratory statutes and
constitutional guarantees are not enough. He
must be qualified to appreciate his rights and
to comprehend the means of vindicating them.
It has been so with the white man; it cannot
be different with the colored man. Practical
equality among men consists largely in intel-
lectual and educational equality,not only before
the law, but in all the relations of life. It has
been suggested that the distribution of lands
among the freedmen would remedy the diffi-
culties of their situation. I should make no
objection to such a policy if it were practicaole.
But I would say, give them intelligence, give
them education, and they will provide lands
for themselves. Without these qualifications
any such provision would be in a great degree
futile. All provisions of law or of land will
be unavailing to secure them from oppression
or from destitution while they remain in their
present condition of ignorance and consequent
imbecility and moral debasement.
But, Mr. President, this necessity of legis-
lation to protect the nation against the perils
of popular ignorance does not arise alone from
the condition of the African race in our midst.
A reference to the census of 1860 reveals the
astounding fact that there were then in the
United States and Territories 1,126,575 white
persons over the age of twenty years who could
neither read nor write; Of these, 467,023
were males, and therefore voters. I present a
table showing how this mass of ignorance was
distributed among the then several States and
Territories :
