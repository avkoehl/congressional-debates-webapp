THE PETlflON TO DISSOLVE IHE UNION
The unfinished business of yesterday was the motion of
Mi. Pendleton that the rules of the Hoiiae be suspended
for the puipose of enabling him to oflei the following resolu
tion
Resolved, That the Constitution was "ordained and esta
Wished" to form a "peifect union" of these States, and that
Congress not only has noauthoiity to take any measures for
the dissolution of that iJnion which it was thus (rented to de
<ie«d and protect, but that it i& th*- paramount duty of every
■department of this Government, and of all the people of these
"States, "indignantly to frown upon the first dawning of every
attemptto alienate any portion ol our country from the lest,
or to enfeeble the sacLed tics which now link together the va
nous parts '
[Note—This lesolution had been offered m view of the pe
Uiion presented yesterday by Mr Giddinos, from citizens of
Ohio, playing an amicable div siou oí ihe Union, by a line
drawn between the free and slave ¡states, which said petition
the House had determined should not be received ]
A brief conversation followed on a point of ords . between
Mr-WINIHROPandthe SPEaKLR
When Mr STLENROD asked the yeas and nays on the mo-
tion to suspend the rule, which were ordered
Mr WARREN, supposing, he said, that the House would
siot act on this subject, moved that the motion to suspend the
rules be laid on the table
Mr. MORGAN That will only make a double vote, and
■take up more time
Mr WARUCN withdrew the motion to lay on the table
And the question then recurred, and was taken, on the
íííotio i to su pend the rules, and the vote was announced as

Mi BlDL\OK here ios?, and moved (with a view to having
an expiession of opinion on that point) to lay aside this bill, for
th« purpose of taking up the Apportionment bill
The CHAIRMAN decided that the motion was out ofordei
Mr BIDLACK appealed fiom the decision
After a few remarks fiom Messrs EVERETT and BIDLACK,
the question, ' Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the |uds
ment of the rommitteei" was then taken and decided m the af
firmative, without a division
So the decision of the Chan wab affirmed
And the question then recurred and was taken on the amend
mentofMr G Davis and it was decided in the negative, with
out a division
bo the amendment to the amendment was rejected
Mr McKFON moved to amend the said item, by striking out
the words 'twenty five thousand," andMoeitn g "six," which
amendment wa? i ejected
Mr G DVVfS tlei moved the following amendment to the
prOVk,    Of Ml   riLLMORC

Mi G DWb briefly enforced the ador (ion oí the amend
ment
He «nidthif, since this bill was last utid°i consideration he
hadrraJean estimate of the prwtingoitnepnbh Depaitment*,
and he found that it amounted to the sdm of one hundí ed
thousand dodars in the year during which the long session oe
curred, and =eventy-five thousand dollars in the vear during
whKh the short session oocurt ed
* He had three objects in view in offenng this amendment
The first was, economy, the second, to give publicity to the in
formation printed in the newspapers, but his principal object
was, to e;u ird m some decree the purity and independence of
the public pie<!-> lie desired to weaken what wa* called 'the
spoils punciplc" in thi*. Government He wanted to wrest
fiom the Depattments some of those spoils which they now an
nually distnbuted among then foll§weis—topievent extrava
gance and corruption—to arrest the abuse of that } cretion
vested m the present head, as it had been m the foimer heads
of the Sítate Department So fai ab econo ny was concetned
sofarasthe piomulgation of information promulgated in the
newspapers was concerned, so far as the ptnity oftbepiess
was concerned, so far as the íeduction of the amount of spoils
which any ad mm isi rati on had to distribute am mg its fo'lowers
was concerned, this amendment, it seemed to him ought toie
ceivethe favorable consider ition of the committee.
Mi D also contended that the amendment was an enforce
ment of the punciple and obvious intent of the law having
íeference o the subject
Mr 1ILLMORE said that the rule which liad been acted on
in relat'On to amendments to appmpnation bills wis this when
Congre^b was appropnating a continent fund it mi mt limit

Whereupon the CHAIRMAN rose and reported that fact to
the House
Mr CTJSHING moved that there be a call of the House,
Mi FILLMORE inquired of the Speaker if it was in order to
offer a resolution directing the publication of the narnes of the
members wjjo were absent It waa apparent that the public
business could not he transacted unless so aiething of thatJeind
were done
The SPEAKER reminded Mr Fillmore that, therenot being

Mr J G  FLOID objected to the leading
