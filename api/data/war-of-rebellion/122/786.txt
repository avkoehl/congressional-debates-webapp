WASHINGTON, January 9, [1862.]

Major-General BUTLER, U. S. Army,

Headquarters Department of New England, Boston:

General McClellan wishes you to wait, as the troops may be wanted elsewhere. He has no desire to break up your expedition.

GEO. C. STRONG,

Ordnance Department.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Des Moines, Iowa, January 10, 1862.

Adjt. General L. THOMAS, U. S. Army,

Washington:

SIR: Since my last regular communication no Iowa regiment has moved from the State for active service in the field. The Fourth Regiment Iowa Cavalry is now under marching orders for Fort Leavenworth, but they have no tents, arms, or ammunition, and h ave not quite their full quota of horses. The Fifteenth Regiment Iowa Infantry needs about 100 men of being full. The Sixteenth Regiment Iowa Infantry have between 300 and 400 in quarters at Camp McClellan and several squads in different parts of the State. The German regiment has 189 men in quarters and is filling up very slowly. This regiment will probably be consolidated with the Sixteenth Infantry. In regard to the recruiting service for regiments in the field, I have nothing to report, as by General Orders, Numbers 105, from your department, the General Government has assumed that service. I have nothing to report as to the progress of the infantry regiment which was recently authorized by the War Department to be raised by Colonel J. W. Rankin, inasmuch as so little time has elapsed since recruiting for that regiment commenced.

Truly, yours,

N. B. BAKER,

Adjutant-General of Iowa.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. ROBINSON,

Aide-de-Camp.
