WALTHALL SIGNAL STATION,

September 26, 1864-6 p. m.

Major FISHER,

Chief Signal Officer:

At 3. p. m. a cloud of dust was observed rising near the fort southwest of this town. On close examination it was thought that we could see guns glisten and that a column of troops was moving in the direction of the city. If it was troops they were two hours passing one point. Owing to the smoky condition of the atmosphere it was impossible to ascertain positively, but it was the impression that it was infantry.

The following has been intercepted:

12 M.

Colonel B[RENT]

The camps to the rear of open space have decreased. Twenty five wagons passed open space going to the front in Chesterfield. One gun-boat above pontoon.
