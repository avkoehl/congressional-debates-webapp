and i-l ed its cons uei  tion at this time
Mr CLW cvject ng, the resolution lies over till
lo-iuoirou
Mi HUBBARD moved that the Senate pio-
ceed tt -morrow ti tl e appomtmen' of thes anding
committees
Mr CLAY said he should be vt ry glad to leain
( from that p-rt ot the Senate which wa ca¡ able of
affoidmg the tnformatirn, wbethel it was m-
tei ded to appoint all the standing com-
' m ttees, and tor v;hat pmpose ' It had been

until the isiidl peno i cf he meeting oí Congress
Tndeel Wc were oil and he th night witiont <>
sufficient regard to tne r "h s, md he would add,
what was of much importance 11 the present ci sis
of the rotintrj tee di * es w Inch Congress ha 1 now
to peifortn, tnai he (tin Pres dc t) haa called theta
togetner toi • cei an (Dip e am he m- nt to
linut his commun catioi s to that purpose, and dis
mi s us when we should   ave done
\svmbled as we tie, (con mued Mr C) we
have a right to loo v to the inlet s's of the vhole
countn —to Ihe interests o* r-11—<"nd for ot e, f
must saj that, •Mthougn no mm has come here
vu h mo e al i"taiee tl -n I hin, ek i-, "lid o

more pleasure arid sin <je ion than I '•hill b )«t
when I regard the present general, unhappy, dis-
tr" &ed, and t mbarrassed condition of ihe country,
I should be moie reluctant, whatever maj have
been the puiposcs of the Presidont, or anv body
else, to íetuin home, until I see some bro?d, com-
prehensive, eftectual plan proposed for the ic'ief of
the counti)
But, sir, I have risen to inquire what is the de-
sign, what is the parpóse, of appointing all the
standing committees if vie are limited to one
single object, and which, according to tne lan-
guage of the message, we aie called here to de-
liberate upon' We know nothing of our fo-
reign affairs , we krovv nothing concerning the
question of th° northeas'ein boundarv, wo know
nothing m lrgird to Te^as Then what ait the ¡ ur-
poses to bo answered by appointing the Comrmt'ee
on Foreign Relations' All that I desne, is to have
1 ghl on the -ubject—to lcam, it it be poss b'e, the
views and purposes of tno e j lto whose hands ire
confided th11 intentions of the -dministrition, why
all the=e committee-- should be appointed
Mr HUBB \RD lemirked lint he legretted as
deeply as the Senator from Kentucky coul 1, the
existence of ->nv cause which hid male it neces-
sary foi the Piesiden* to assemble Congiess -H this
time, and he was quite sine that he had left his
home wi h as much leluctanoe to perfoim his du y
leie, as thai Senator, or a* any o'net Senator
But Congiess weie now assembled both Houses
had b<?en oigamzed in the Usual manner, and
communritions had been mtercminged that the
two Houses weie now ready to proceed in the
transaction of the public 1 usmess, and, afte- such
a meeting, what was it pioper fot the Senate to do1
By the 33d rule, it was made ihei- duty ai the com-
mencement of each session to appoint tneir stand-
ing committee- This was the law, and it had
been the nvunble piaclicc of the Senate An I
\ as theie any ic>-, obi cation an} less pi op tety
oí ni} le i po tuice, (oi tic Sm te to appi mt
its usual stinting commi tets it an extra sis un,
than theie wdo ai an ordinal y session of Congress'
He did not «o consider the matter The rule itself
was imperative The course of proceeding was, to
his mmd, plain, and he had offere 1 the resolution
in accordance with his sense of duty He was
well aware, vutn the S natoi front Kentucky, (hat
the Piesident h?d, in his public mes age, wrch
had been com numcatcd to Congress-, alluded
mainly to but one subject, and what seemed to
him to be neces-arily connected therew uh, and he
was tue to admit that that was a subject of deep
and al i ling nn oitancc io the mteieftsof onrv h 'e
connti\ But do - the Senator knoi that the Pre-
sident may not, by special message during the pre-
sen session, commun cate to Congress otnei and
different subjects? Ceitam the fact is, lhat the
people thems Ives aie not precluded by th- Message
from comma lie<c \\ th th u memorials Tl ey
have a right to juesent hne their petitions md
would it be wise or piop i foi the Senate to refuse
to hear, cons ler and dispo l ot these matte s in
the usnl miniiei, b t ause this happened to be an
extra ses ion of Congre s cill"d b) the Piesmtnt
for a particular md avev ed pmpose' He thought
not This sess on of Congress hiv mg commenced,
he had offered to the Senate the resolution for the
appointment of the usual committees, a- the best
and most legitimate mode for the d>sposal of the
public and private busme-s which mn be presented
foi its cons derail jn He could not doubt thit the
great and absorbing subject referred to in ihe Presi-
dent's Message, would engage the unitmitttd atten-
tion, and would con mand the most fa thful service
of the Senate, but the all-importance or tint sub-
ject "nd the fict of its being cxclu«iv eh cons dered
in ihe Message wa? to his mmd, no sufficient rea= in
asamst tl e appointment of the standing commi'-
tees The consideration of that subject would be,
and should be the main bus ne^-oi the present ses
sion H could i ot believe that the appointment ol
the committees \ouldnec - "nlv protract tie so-,
sion Aftei the c mipletion of the busmesswhich nad
summoned Congress together, Congress vmuld a 1-
joiira He was as anxious as any man could be,
to bring th s session to a speedy close, to fini-h the
work piopei to be done , and he felt assuied tl "t
bv evening ihen best efforts, Congress  vvoul! b<-
able ai this se-sion to accomplish some measure
which would, m effect, lestore confdence, rnlgive
relief t the coirmun tj He was "s uisira^s as
the Senator fiom Keniucky, or as any othci Sena-
tor, could be, to have this done, and done speedily
He had, therefoie, thus early introduced the reso-
lution for the appointment of the committees He
hoped to see this a si oit but a busmc s ses-ion It
s°emed to him that every con-ideralioi of pohcy
and of duty shou d indnce the Senate at th s time to
na'e the appo ntment of their committee- He
hoped, ther-foie, that 1 is motion would lealopted
