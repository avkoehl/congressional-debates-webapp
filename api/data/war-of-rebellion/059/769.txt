HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY DEPARTMENT,Jackson, Tenn., April 10, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel THOMAS M. JACK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to state that Captain Oliver has reported to these headquarters with orders to thoroughly inspect my command, and regret very much that the position and the duties of the troops render it totally impossible for him to do so. In order to watch the enemy in all directions the command is much scattered, and heavy scouting as well as frequent moves are rendered unavoidable my scarcity of forage, preventing concentration at any one point, and no report or inspection can take place until I can draw in the regiments on outpost duty and get return also from that portion of my command stationed on the Tallahatchie and those with my wagon trains at Aberdeen.

I expect in the course of ten or twelve days to move back into North Mississippi and expect to take out with me at least 2,000 more troops, conscripts and deserters included; if not moved upon by the enemy in that time will probably get out with even a greater number. Will then have my command together and full reports and thorough will be made. I have four regiments in Southern Kentucky, with orders as they move back to bring with them every man they can get hold of between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Governor Harris is at Paris with a detachment of men who are performing the same duty. Bell's brigade, of Buford's division, is posted from Bolivar around by Raleigh, with orders to take up and send to Jackson every one subject to military duty and all absentees from the army. Would be glad if the lieutenant-general commanding would give me instructions as to what disposition to make of them; only those will be received in the cavalry who are well mounted. Old commands will be, as far as practicable, filled up; the balance will be forwarded or held as you may direct.
