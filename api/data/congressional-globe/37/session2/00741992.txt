THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 7,
distinguish themselves in the field. I hope a great
many of them willxassomeof them have. In re-
gard to brigadier generals, there are eight briga-
dier generalsof the regular Army, and I have made
out a list of all the brigadiergenerals of the vol-
unteers, and I find the number to be precisely two
hundred, and that added to the eight makes two
hundred and eight altogether.
Mr. FESSENDEN.'Two hundred confirmed ?
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. Two hun-
dred sent in.
Mr. HALE. How many "have "been confirmed?
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. One hun-
dred and sixty-eight have "been confirmed,and as
to two of them motions to reconsider have been
entered, so that we have one hundred and sixty-
six brigadier generals of volunteers confirmed and
thirty-four unconfirmed or unsettled,, making two
hundred brigadier generals altogether, confirmed
and before the Senate. I have taken these briga-
dier generals and made up a list, classifying them
for each State, so that I have before me a list of
all the generals in the several States making up the
whole number. I will present it to the Senate:

Hoiatio P. Van Cltve,
It will be seen that we have now eight regular
Army brigadiers, and onp hyndred,and sixty-six
confirmed volunteer brigadiers, which makes one
hundred and seventy-four. If the number is kept
at two hundred we have twenty-four vacancies,
and we have thirty-four nominations for these va-
cancies. That would rcject ten of them. If you
cut it down to one hundred and eighty, you can
confirm only six of the thirty-four that are before
the Senate, and I will say in regard to them that
several of the gentlemen whose names have been
sent in and are yet unacted upon, a few of them
certainly, are officers of real merit, and some of
them I desire to see confirmed on account of their
merit. Some of them have fought themselves into
favor and I think should receive promotion. On
an examination of the whole subject, I am inclined
to think we had better take the bill as it was in-
troduced by the Senator from Iowa.
Mr. HALE. The Senator has said a good deal
about what the generals want and what would be
justice to the generals; but how many does the
service want, how many does the country want?
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. That is a
matter of opinion.
Mr. HALE. Let us have your opinion.
Mr. "WIIvSON, of Massachusetts. I expressed
an opinion the other day. Referring simply to the
volunteers, I said that I thought we could have
got along with one hundred and fifty generals. I
have not changed my opinion since on this sub-
ject, but the War Office and the President have
sent in here two hundred. As this bill includes
the regular Army brigadiers, of whom there are
eight, it would leave only one hundred and ninety-
two volunteer brigadier generals. I am inclined
to stand by the original bill.
Mr. HARRIS. I have no admiration at all for
this sort of legislation.
Mr. HALE. I have.
Mr. HARRIS. The Senator from New Hamp-
shire and I differ, it seems. It implies two things
which do not meet my approbation. In the first
place, it implies that the President will nominate
more brigadicrgenerals than the service requires,
and thus imputes a want of fidelity on his part.
It implies again that the Senate will confirm more
nominations than the service requires, which I do
not think is quite just to the Senate. But, sir, that
is comparatively a small matter. I am not much
of u military man, but I have some general ideas
in relation to military service, and I have always
supposed that every company required a captain.
I suppose that sometimes when there happens to
be a vacancy, a lieutenant will perform the duties
of captain very well. I do not know but that some
Senators here would like the idea of limiting the
number of captains so that a certain proportion
of the companies should be commanded by cap-
tain^ and other companies should be commanded
by lieutenants, and I do not know but that that
would do. I think from the suggestions I have
heard made in certain quarters here in the Senate,
that that would meet the views of some Senators,
that some companies should be commanded by
captains and that other companies should be com-
manded by lieutenants.
I suppose it has been thought wise that every
regiment should be commanded by a colonel, and
then to provide for the want of a colonel there has
been a sort of deputy appointed, a lieutenant col-
