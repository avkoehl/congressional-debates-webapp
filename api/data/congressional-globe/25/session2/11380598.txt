must ha attributed to the miseiable skulking manner m which
the pledge of the public faith has been managed? Instead of an
open and direct offer to borrow, which shall attract theatten
tion of capitalista, and insure the widest range of competition,
these notes are issued in dribs to the public creditors, and their
price, as they straggle into market, is fixed by the sharers into
whose hands the} unavoidably tail They are bought up, less
with reference to the interest ultimately payable on them, than
vn account of their receivabiluy in payments to the public, and
with a view to profit by the daily fluctuation of the demand, as
a greater or less amount of dues to the Government chance to
become payable. And yet, e r, when we seek to rescue the Go-
vernment as well as us creditors oat of the hands of this worst
and narrowest class of money dealers—when we entreat that the
credit of thih great Republic may be used m a mode which shall
no* only be moat pioductive, but m some measurerouipon with
the national dignity—a ciy is raised that we are all in a plot to
bung the Government into disrepute1
Mr Chairman, there is an argument which, with, this Admi
mstiation at least, ought not to be destitute of weight In a letter,
dated Hermitage, 23d July, 1837, addressed to the editor of the
fcrlohe General Jackson says
"I hope no Treasury notes willbeiscued The Treasury
dtafts upon actual deposite* are c institutional, and do not
partake of p¿pu credits as Treasury notesy which are subject
to depreciation by the merchants and banks, and sharers and
brokers, and will be, if issued, and the Government cannot
avoid it"
Sir, who ha  proved himself the more sagacious and far
sighted of the two, General Jackson or Mr Cambrelengi I had
the curiosity to stop on my way to the fcfouse, to inquire at a
bicker's office the difference between Treasury notes and specie
Tne answer was, that t e notes be*nng six per cent interest
were at a discount of two per cent and those bearing one mil!
inteiestata discount ofthree per cent The difference has been,
to my knowledge, much greater, and may be so again, when the
demand for their employment in payments to the public shall
slacken And sir, e /el when you sae them quoted at par, it is
the brokei who piofitsby this precarious rise, not the individual
to whom you gave the note, and who was ob lged to pa*>s it off
as he best could at the moment
But we suppose that this fluctuating omency should  at any
moment of is^ue, be above specie, it is plain that the creditor to
whom the uutesare paid receives, at the public expends, just so
i íuch n ore than he is entitled to Heie would be a new point
in the range of discrimination Why snould thispremium go
to those who may suceeedm getting Treasury notes, when they
happen to he better than ihe constitutional currency] Why

m Pennsylvania, this scornful abandonment of General Jai k
son s "foo steps" wi 1 not be atoned for by the accession of
those who now act as volunteer guides upon the new path into
which you have diveig°d
It has been asked by gentlemen on this floor, Does not an mdi

and foil  w the tram of lefieciion it suggests ¡oupf oae a man

manure urer who, on pay day, should meet his hands with
sjch a prop v*ition? It is s* id \v~ have resouices m the perspsc
tive, and, therefore, need not boirow Why, sir, this is the case
of eveiy man who seeks a loau with any expee'ation of sue
ces He says ' I have a great deal coming fo me, my books
show a vast aimunt due from individuals of undoubted credit,
but, meantime, there are calk for cash which I must meet with
punctuality and "ood faiih, Í ask a discount until those claim*
comerouni" Sir, it has piohably happened to everyone to
witness, with indignation and di gust the devices oí plunder by
which an unprincipled employer hassmght to p nch and screw
the laboréis m ms service And yeta system which we would
biandas infamous in private lire is seriously recommended for
the ad>puon of this great people'
Mr Cnairman if the parallel hold good as to dishonesty, it is
not. less complete as to improvidence He who can gef rid oí
preoent demands by merelv signing a due bill, is delighted at
this easy mode of putting off the evilday and runs thoughtlessly
oi But a reckoning at last comes, and he finas himself over
whelmed He is a vic'im to that facility which the first 3ecre
tary of the Treasury describee aa so treacherously seductive
Had he been dnven to a loan—bad his credit b~en brought to a
teat—he might have been fot ted to reflect, ere it was too late,
upon h.s fo 'y and extravagance
Kir th° gentleman from ^outh Carolina, (Mr Khbtt,] whilst
con ending that opposition to this measure is to place the Go-
vern nerit at tne mercy cf the moneyed power, thought proper
to i idol 'p in a °tr^n of nvertive against hanks and capita1 and
even to thiea  a om a íes with ou breaks of popular violence
1  will notrep^attheableargument ofthe gentleman from Vir
gnia [Mr Mabon,] in reply Ttwas a matter of generil mern
mem in the House to witness how instantly the inflated balfoon
at the first touch of his apear—the «pear of Truth-Hioliapeed,
and shrunk up into nothing Sir, theabaolute absurdity of the
charge, in reference ta this bill, disarmed the indignation it was
calculated to provoke Yet who could patiently listen to these
efforts to get up a spirit of arson and assassination? It is easy to
say they mean nothing, except in tfee way of caution and warn-
ing This is the Simey veil always thrown over such eugges
üons Once establwh that they are justifiable, and pretexts
spring up, or may be manufactured Whose judgment is to de
cide when the fit occasion has arnvedt If there be any mean
ing or relevancy m the gentleman's remarks, the rejection oí this
bill would, be a proper signal for Lynch law. if this House
should choose to profit by the lessons of Gen, Jackson, when
backed by experience, if it should choose to pay its creditors
li Jnestly and equally, if it should refuse to incur extravagant in
terest, and insist on rescuing the credit oí the country from the
httnds oí brokers and shavers, why, then these denunciations
ome into play The misconduct oftms House is to be avenged
by pillage, and murder m the streets of Philadelphia! People
are impelled to vio ence by the very thought that they may be
deemed tame, and cold, and spiritless, m disappointing the pre
dictions of their special advocates and orators
Surely, sir, this strain is altogether misplaced mthe mouth of
a gentleman and a scholar, it belongs to a different, though very
numerous, class Some one says, m Shakspeare, " I'll have a
starling that shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer "
There is a race of politicians, all over our country, who seem
to have been educated on the same plan as this starling They
have been taught to speak nothing but " bank' bank'" and are
altogether at fault when requn ed to vary the note Yet I do in-
justice The starling is a gentle and interesting bird Rather
are we reminded of a filthy parrot, hung out m front of a sailor
boarding house, taught by its master to utter exclamations at
each passer by, and never joyous or happy unless when en
gaged in screaming out rogue or strumpet
Sir, we are led to infer, from the strange inapplicability of the
gentleman's remarks, at least to this bill, that they were pre
pared foi a very different occasion In the confusion he may,
by an accident notuncommon, have put bis baggage on board
the wrong beat Yet there may be method an «calculation in
all this It m perhaps, apprehended that no opportunity will
hereafter occur tor the delivery of Sub Treasury speeches
Thtse things often hang by a frail chain of coincidence^ Mr
B remembered to have heard of a lady, very fond of at eroding
auctions, who bought, amongst other things, a secondhand
brass knocker, bearing the name of "Henderson * She ev
plained that her husband might ale, she 7meh¡lmaxrj a Hender
son, and then it would come into play The story ran thather
husband did died, and she did mairy a Henderson But this
was not every body's luck It was wise, then, fer tho^e who
had such speeches ready, not to Uust to the future Theie
was, indeed, a pecu'iar hardship on those gentlemen fiom
South Carolina who had gone ovei to their bitterest personal
a*d poli leal foes on this scheme, that it seemed to have disap
peai"d— o have been bunpd by the people at the Cioss Roado,
with a stakethiough its middle—before they had enjoyed an o"
cation to pronounce its eulogy, oi evento dsk for it the rights
ofdecentsepuhuie
One other remark of the gentleman claims a passing notice
He tellia u-* the money power' has been insubordinate, und
forgetful oi its appropuate character Let u^see how far the
denunciation sav"«& of consistency from that gentleman, oi
from the distinguished head of the school to which he belongs
[Mi Calhoun j It is now tgreed that the great danger from -t
National Bank i«, not that it will prove an antagonist ofthe ex
istmg Admimsuation, but tha* it may become a supple instiu
me it Thisis adoctune pressed at gieat lei gth by many Se
nator  Tney doubtless smile, in secret, at the notion of dancer
from a contest between tlie Government and a Bank, although,
as the clamor had been got up on that pi «text, they feclju->ti
fled m turning it toaccourt. Sutserviencj is the matter to he
rudlly dreaded And, undoubtedly, they are rightas to tbes) m
pathies e( money with power Faletaff describes hissoldieis as
"a commodity of warm slaves, that had as lief hear the devil as
a drum " bo it is with money Its habits are warm, its palm
moist and tremulous, there is no rufgedt vigor about it It
shrinks from contest, and will purchase safety by the most ab
ject submission ARd yet, sir, in reference to a signal instance
in which all these debasing tendencies were íesisted, m which
a BinL stood up manfully and braved the frowns and rage of
the Executive, rather than compromise KMiuet we he^r oi
danger to the country from that very unyielding perseverance
in the discharge of a high and solemn duty The Executive
triumphed, the Bank was prostrated Should a new Bank at
an> di-tance of time be created, it will go into operation, not
only with tí' the evjl tendencies btid to be inherent m Us na
ture, but with tht mpmonble lesson constantly in view, that its
predeceswoi fell a victim to stiffness in maintaining an indepen
dence of Executive dictation South Carolina, it eeems, row
holds, that the triumph of the Executive should be complete,
that it eughtnot to be disturbed by even a feeling of sympathy
for the vctim H >w is it, sir, that her proud and chivairoub
spirit can thus stoop to pluck the dead lion by the beard?
The gentleman t* lit- us that there has been a systematic v. ar
fare of the banks upon the Government, whilst the latter has
remained almost passive bir, there may be a satisfactory
reason why he is not very familiar with the history of that
period Whilst that war was in progress, another of a very
different ch trader was going on aeainst himself and his fellow
citizens At that period, as 11 em ember, it w*s the fashion to
introduce scurrilous paragraphs in the Globe, with "John C Cal-
houn, who could never speak the truth wh n falsehood would
answer the purpose,' &c The cry at Washmgton then was,
that John C Calhoun should be hunsr up on the first tree, anil
the gentleman himself was denounced as (he wortt of traitors
It may well be, then, that his remmiscerces of the subordinate
content are so newhat vaeue and shadowy Sir, I am not
now about to traverse that va^t field, but if he will take the
trouble to look over the official paper, which is now the organ of
his par y,he will find abundan materials for bet'er understanding
the history ofthe two contests simultaneously carried on With
outcome back mere than avear, he will findane^sayin the

And again, as to the employment of the State banks.
" Let those who now inveigh agaiost the employment of the
State bunks at that time, look back, and ask themselves whether
it was possible fot General Jackson to accomplish his ob-
ject by any other means If he had proposed a separa* on
from all bank?, he wuu d hare foandall tne State banks and
their friends m full and effective alliance with the Bank of the
United States—a league which it wae not desirable to encounter.
Neithsr Me public mind, nor the ojnnions. of the members of
Omgressj were then prepared* for a separation of bank and
State "
Sir, in these paragraphs you have a compendious view ofthe
warfare upon the Bank ofthe Umted States, as well as upon tho
Stae institutions We all know howattfuliy the latter were
played off upon the former Their cupidity was excited, tfaeir
pride, local, and personal, mflftmed, the influence of the Phi-
ladelphia institution represented as an injurious and mortifying
ascendency At length, the whole were thrown together into
the cock pit, with gafts fired by a dexterous hand, to tear each
other's eyes and pierce each other's hearts'
I turn, sir, to the chairman ofthe Committee of Ways and
Means, [Mr Cambksleno j Whilet urging the immediate
passage of this bilí as indispensable to save the national credit
irom degradation, he has introduced a medley of topics well «.al-
culateá to provoke the widest discussion If he deemed it ne^
cessary to connect them With this measure, notwithstanding the
pressure for time, how has he found it reconcilable with justice
or decorum to join in a pertinacious though unsuccessful ef-
fort to cut off all opportunity of reply?
We have heard, amongst otber things, a eulogy on the gene*
ral banking law of New York, as having broken the chains by
which chartered monopolies had so long fettered the energies
oí the great Empire State Of the mente of that scheme I am
not about to speak As the act of a sovereign State, it is enti-
tled, on this floor, to the highest respect, and, as an interesting
experiment about to be tiled by a leading member of the Con-
federacy, it rlaims our heartiest good Wishes for its success.
The only point of view, however, in which (he subject becomes
of national interest has escaped the notice of the chairman At
the commencement of the present sesión of Congress the Pre-
anient adverted to the great revolution m the State of New
York, which bad given a complete ascendancy to his political
oppo&ents He assured us that this result was brought about
by the influence of the banking corporations in that Stale Now,
sn, do we understand that t*us charge is persisted ml Are we
still meed to believe that a Legislatuie which has thus disen-
thralled the people from an odious bank monopoly came into
power as tho creature and instrument oí that bank in i opoly?
This part of the message has not been disposed of by the House
It has gone forth to the world as a stigma upon free institutions
It has been cited In the English newspapers to show how sordid
and venal is the *itaie which borders upon Canada and how lit
tlereason there is todread collision with a people ihus charac
tenzed by their own chief magistrate
It has pleased tiie chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means to mtioduce, in the most incidental way, a topic of the
deepest interest at the present moment—thatof the lesuaiption
of specie payments I am glad he did eo In every part of tho
countr> the eyes of the people are turned towards the banks
1 hese institutions have existed for **ome- time at bare sufferance
Popular opinion has thus far restiamed the pursuitof the rezne
dies against them which the laws already afford Ought for
bearance to be continued longer? This is a question which has
swelled toa magnitude that claims for it the attention of all;
and he ma\ he justly deemed a public benefactoi who lends his
aid to the formation of an enlightened and dispassionate judg.

Mr B had, therefore, hoped to learn from gentlemen on
this floor, whose reputation stood high fei fimncial knowledge
and experience, how they thought this resumption was to be
generally and safely effected and tontinued, particularly m th
interior, under the system which they had so long struggled to
fasten upon us For his constituents, at least, he could offer
a pledge that they would gi*e a fair hearing to argument, and
that they would sternly carry out the conclusion at w hich their
judgment ami ed They had no empathy with these metitu
uon* except as msirummts to promote the public benefit
They v.ere nw more wedded to the banks than the) were to the
pis works or the water wmks or any oiher m titution which
had demanded a larger investment than suited the mean*- or con-
venience of individual capitalists Mr B personally had the
same feeling He owned not a dollar ot bank -tock, and his
own eimp'e habits and pui^uits had preserved him from any
feeling of gratitude for Javors conferred, or of resentment for
their refusal
Sir, said Mr íí T well know that these institutions never «aa
be what is called 'popular   The berefits they render are
mwisible or unheeded, whilst causes of irritation are daily ad 
dreseed to the eager passions of men For one who receives
aid, how many hundreds are tht re who encounter denial—who
deem themselves injured or insulted—and clamorously de
nouneewhattheyrepresentasparnality or caprice? And, ifthts
be the en*** vtithin the immediate sphere of their accommoda-
tions, we know that m the country they h&\ e always been \ lewed
with dislike They are regarded as complex machines, by
which money is 'apidly made m th towns, through mysierjous
processes denied to ihoee whose hard earnings are derived from
direct toil—from the cweat of the harvest-field Long before
the great contest ot recent years, which hae drawn so largely
on this feeling, whodoes not recall the numberlessmstances in
y, hich he has seen it successfully invoked by «mall demagogues
toesrnacheapand worthless popularity'1 It is part, indeed,
of that jealousy between town and country which may be so
read!.y worked upon and inflamed Nn, sir • The public man
who exposes himself to tht4 chaige of being an advocate of
oanks, does so at imminent risk He must look for support
to the consciousness that he is called upon by duty to oppose
himself, at all hazards, to the artifices of designing politics!
knaves, and with a full knowledge tha* he becomes a mark for
the erG8f=e*t misrepresentation
Yet, sir I wo ¿VI ¡cm hope that the public mind is now pre-
pared for more just and enlarged news. It seems impossible
for any one of us not tosee the áesp stake Which the whole com-
munity has m guarding these institutions front wanton assault
or premature eondempatgon.    The capital which they hav
