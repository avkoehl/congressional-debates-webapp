The longer you wait the less originality and force there will seem to be in your policy. Please write me on the subject at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully, Governor, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., April 12, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel HYNES,

Pilot Knob:

The mail for your command goes via Sainte Genevieve, where you will receive it. The general commanding has concluded to postpone the placing of a company of infantry in the fort for a short time until other arrangements have been effected to admit of its being done. The detachment of Company F, Fiftieth Missouri Volunteers, now here has been mustered out. Captain Lindsay thinks he can reorganize it. The detachment of that company left at Mineral Point will be placed in charge of Lieutenant Moran, of Company E, Fiftieth Missouri Volunteers, now at Potosi. The orders have been issued and you will receive them in due time.

By order of Brigadier-General Wagner:

H. HANNAHS,

Major and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
