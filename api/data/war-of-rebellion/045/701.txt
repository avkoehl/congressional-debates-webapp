SANDY HOOK, July 15, 1863-2 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The bridge over the Potomac will now let troops pass into the Shenandoah Valley. It will take us till morning to repair the bridge over the Shenandoah. We are at it. I am patching up boats, so as to et, if I can, the number of boats necessary for the bridge at Berlin, even if the boats do not arrive from Washington by to-morrow night. The wheelbarrows were to be here at noon to-day. If they come, the canal will be done to-morrow evening. The canal is dry above the dam, 1 mile above Harper's Ferry, owing to a break in the aqueduct at the mouth of the Monocacy.

G. K. WARREN,

Brigadier-General.
