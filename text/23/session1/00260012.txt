12                                     THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                               Dec. 5,
by Congress without injuiy to the substantial m-
teiesu ot the country, there might be for some
yeais to come a surplus of moneys in the Treasu
ly, and that there was, m principle, no objection
to letu mi.; them to the people by whom ihey
were pat 1 As the literal accomplishment of such
an )ojectisr>bvi >usly impiacticable.it was thought
ndmi;>sibie, as the nearest approximation to it, to
hand them ovei to the State governments, the
moie immediate representatives of the people, to
be by them applied to the benefit of those to whom
they properly belonged The principle and the
ol jeet was, to return to the people an unavoidable
surplus of revenue which might have been paid
by them under a ■iyotem which could not at once
be abandoned, but even this resource, which at
one time teemed to be almost the only alternative
to save the General G ivernment from grasping un-
limited power over internal improvements, was
suggested with doubts of its constitutionality
But this bill assumes a new principle Its object
is not to return to the people an unavoidable sur-
plus of revenue paid in by them, but to create a
¡surplus for disti lbution among the States It seizes
the entne proceeds of one source of revenue and
sets them apait as a surplus, making it necessary
to raise the moneys for supporting the Government
•xnd meeting the genei a) charges from other souices
It even throws the entire land system upon the cus-
toms for its support, and makes the public lands a
perpetual charge upon theTieasury It does not
íeturn to the people moneys accidentally or una-
voidably paid by them to the Government, by
which they are not wanted, but compels the people
to pay moneys into the Tieasury for the mere pur-
pose of creating a surplus for distribution to their
State governments If this principle be once ad-
mitted it is not difficult to perceive to what conse
quences it may lead Already this bill, by throw-
ing the land system on the revenues from imports
foi support, virtually distributes among the States
a part of those revenues The proportion may be
increased, fiom time to time, without any depar
tuie from the pi inetple now asserted, until the State
govei nments shall derive all the funds necessary for
their su'port from the Tteasury ot the United
States, or, if a sufficient supply should be obtained
by some States and not by otheis, the deficient
States might complain, and to put an end to all
further difficulty, Congress, without assuming any
new principle, need go but one step further, and put
the salaries of ai the State governors, judges, and
othei ofiiceis, with a sufficient sum for other ex-
penses in then general appropriation bill
It appears to me that a more direct road to con-
solidation cannot be devised Money is power,
and in that Government which pays all the public
officeis of the States will all political power be
substantially concentrated. The State govern-
ments, if governments they might be called, would
lose all their independence and dignity The econ
omy which now distinguishes them would be con-
vened into a profusion, limited only by the extent
of the supply. Being the dependents of the Gen-
ei al Government, and looking to its Treasury as the
source of all then emoluments, the State officers,
under whatever names they might pas^, and by
whatever forms their duties might be prescribed,
would, in effect, be the mere stipendiaries and in-
struments of the central power
I am quite sure that the intelligent people of our
seveial States will be satisfied, on a little reflection,
that it is neithei wise nor safe to release the mem
bers of their local Legislatures fiom the responsi-
bility of levying the taxes necessary to support
their State governments, and vest it in Congress,
over most of whose members they haveno control
They will notthinkitexpedientthatCongiessshall
be the tax gatherer and paymaster of all their State
governments, thus amalgamating all their officers
into one mass of common interest and common
feeling It is too obvious that such a couise would
subvert our we'l balanced system of government,
and ultimately deprive us of all the blessings now
derived from our happy Union
However willing I might be that any unavoid-
able surplus in the Treasury should be returned to
the people through their State governments, I
cannot assent to the principle that a surplus may
be created foi the purpose of distribution View
mi this bill as in effect assuming the right not
only to create a surplus foi that purpose, but to
I divide the contents of the Treasury among the
I States without limitation, from whatever source
' they may be derived, and asserting the power to
rait,e and appropriate money foi the support of
j every State government and institution, as well
j as for making every local improvement, however
trivial, I cannot give it my assent.
It is difficult to peiceive what advantages would
accrue to the old States or the new from the sys-
tem of distribution which this bill proposes, if it
were otherwise unobjectionable It requires no
argument to prove that if three millions of dollars
a year, or any othei sum, shall be taken out of
the Treasury Tjy this bill for distribution, it must
be replaced by the same sum collected fiom the
people through some other means The old
States will receive annually a sum of money from
the Treasury, but they will pay in a larger sum,
together with the expenses of collection and dis
tribntion It is only their proportion of seven
eighths of the proceeds of land sales which they
aie to receive, but they must pay their due pro-
portion of the whole Disguise it as we may the
bill proposes to them a dead loss, in the ratio of
eight to seven, m addition to expenses and other
incidental losses This assertion is not the less
true because it may not at first be palpable
Their receipts will be in large sums, but their
payments in small ones. The governments of the
States will receive seven dollars for which the
people of the States will pay eight. The large
sums received will be palpable to the senses, the
small sums paid it requires thought to identify
But a little consideration will satisfy the people
that the effect is the same as if seven hundred dol-
lars were given them from the public Treasury,
for which they were at the same time required to
pay in taxes, direct or indirect, eight hundred
1 deceive myself greatly if the new States would
find their interests promoted by such a system as
this bill proposes Their true policy consists in
the rapid settling and improvement of the waste
lands within their limits. As a means of hasten-
ing those events, they have long been looking to
a reduction in the price of public lands upon the
finaj payment of the national debt. The effect
of the proposed system would be to prevent that
reduction. It is true, the bill reserves to Con-
gress the power to reduce the price, but the effect
of its details, as now arranged, would probably be
forever to prevent its exercise
With the just men who inhabit the new States
it is a sufficient reason to reject this system that
it is in violation of the fundamental laws of the
Republic and its Constitution But if it were a
mere question of interest oi expediency they would
still reject it They would not sell then bright
prospect of incieasing wealth and growing power
at such a price They would not place a sum of
money to be paid into then treasuries in compe-
tition with the settlement of their waste lands and
the increase of theirpopulation. They would not
consider a small or a large annual sum to be paid
to their governments and immediately expended,
as an equivalent for that enduring wealth which is
composed of flecks and herds and cultivated farms
No temptation will allure them from that object of
abiding interest, the settlement of their waste lands,
and the increase of a hardy race of free citizens,
their glory in peace and their defence in war.
On the whole, I adhere to the opinion expressed
by me in my annual message of 1832, that it js
our true policy that the public lands shall cease,
as soon as practicable, to be a source of revenue,
except for the payment of those general charges
which grow out of the acquisition of the lands,
their survey and sale. Although these expenses
have not been met by the proceeds of sales here-
tofore, it is quite certain they will be hereafter,
even after a considerable reduction in the price
By meeting in the Treasury so much of the general
charge as arises from that source, they will here-
after, as they have been heretofore, be disposed
of for the common benefit of the United States
according to the compacts of cession I do not
doubt that it is the real interest of each and all the
States in the Union, and particularly of the new
States, that the price of these lands shall be reduced
and graduated, and that after they have been
offered for a certain number of years, the refuse
remaining unsold shall be abandoned to the States,
I and the machinery of our land system entirely
withdrawn. It cannot be supposed the compacts
intended that the United States should retain for-
ever a title to lands within the States which aie
of no value, and no doubt is entertained that the
genei al interest would be best promoted by surren-
dering such lands to the States
This plan for disposmg of the public lands
impairs no principle, violates no compact, and de-
ranges no system Already has the pi ice of those
lands been reduced from two dollars per acre to
one dollar and a quarter, and upon the will of
Congress it depends whether there shall be a
further reduction While the burdens of the East
aie diminishing by the reduction of the duties
upon imports it seems but equal justice that the
chief burden of the West should be lightened in
an equal degree at least It would be just to the
old States and the new, conciliate every interest,
disarm the subject of all its dangers, and add
another guarantee to the perpetuity of our happy
Union
Sensible, however, of the difficulties which sur-
round this important subject, I can only add to
my regrets at finding myself again compelled to
disagree with the legislative power, the sincere
declaration, that any plan which shall promise a
final and satisfactoiy disposition of the question,
and be compatible with the Constitution and public
faith, shall have my hearty concurrence

ment under similar circumstances, and was ad-
dressed to the public ear through this body, &c.

marks made by Mr. Clay, and in vindication of
the course pursued by the Chief Magistrate.
Mr CLAY rejoined
Mr BENTON then withdrew the motion to re-
sume the consideration of the message

of the message were ordered to be printed
[The incidental debate above alluded to will be
given in full hereafter ]

day next, ask leave to introduce a bill " to appro-
priate, for a limited time, the proceeds of the sales
of the public lands "

Monday next, move for leave to introduce a bill
to repeal the act of last session entitled •' An act
to amend the several acts providing for the collec-
tion of duties on imports "
Mr BENTON submitted the following resolu-
tion-
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be directed to report to the Senate—1st A state-
ment of the amount of public moneys in the Bank
of the United States at the end of each month for
