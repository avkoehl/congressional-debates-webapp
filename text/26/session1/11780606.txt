APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
26th Cowg« ««1st Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Parrish.
June, 1840.
H. of Reps.
these facts as they are recorded in the history of this
country, and found in Congressional documents, I
ask the committee, and through it -the American
people, to remember, first, that neither of these
banks was chartered until the Government was
loaded with debt. I ask that it may also be re-
membered that neither England nor France, that
have been held up to us as patterns, nor any other
Government on earth, ever created a National
Bank, without first having a heavy national debt.
Secondly, that the debt of this Government in boih
instances constituted much the largest part of the
capital of those institutions; such has been the case
in England, France, and all other countries having
National Banks. Thirdly, that this Government now
has no such debt. It has virtually none. lis nomi-
nal debt cannot amount to $5,000,000, and pro-
bably not exceed two millions; and this arising
from the suspension of the banks in 1837, and de-
positing the surplus revenue with the Sates. Now
is it doing justice to the memories of Washington and
Madison, ths tenor of whose opinions throughout
were in opposition to the banking system, to say,
or suppose, if they were now present under such
different and more favorble circumstances than
those of 1791, and 1816, that either would
be in favor of creating another National Bank;
or that either would be willing to plunge this Go-
vernment into a much larger debt than it has ever
owed, for the parpóse of making a greater bank
capital than any that has heretofore existed? I
think such assumptions an abuse of the memories
of those great men. I have shown the system
of taxation under different tariffs from the time
the Bank was created, and the manner by which
it and the other banks profited by the use of the
public money, and will now examine what effect
was produced upon sommerce, manufactures, pro-
duce, labor, and the currency during its existence.
For this purpose I have prepared the following ta-
ble from the report of a committee appointed
by this House to inspect the books and examine
into the proceedings of the Bank, made in 1832.
EXHIBIT of the amount of specie drawn from
each of the Southern and Western offices to the
Bank at Philadelphia, and to the branch at New
York, from 1819 to 1832, a period of twelve
years:

This table shows the regular system with which
the Bank extracted specie, and concentrated it in
its own vaults, or sent it abroad—that this extrac-
tion was from the producing, and more especially,
the provision growing sections of the Union. The
amount drawn from New Orleans evinces this.
During the same time, in addition to the amount
drawn from that place, the Bank exported from
thence) direct to England'and France, an additional
 um of $947,325, making the whole amount drawn
from ihat port nearly equal to two-thirds of the
whole amount which it gathered in eleven years.
I have before shown what proportion of the spe-
cie which comes into this country, arrived at the
port of New Orleans. By the report of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury in 1839, it amounted to
$2,178,348, nearly one-third of all that came into
the United States, in other years, but which will be
much more this and the succeeding year. Of tlm,
the largest portion was from South America and
the West Indies, in exchange for provisions. This
was the case during the existence of the Bank,
and must continue to be. This specie would na-
turally, if uninterrupted by paper issues, find its
way, as much of it does now, to the sources where
fleur, bacon, and beef are raised, in Missouri, Illi-
nois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Western Virginia,
and the western part of Pennsylvania. There it
would constitute the circulation, pay for the public
lands, and be a basis for, trne commercial credit,
and find its way into other sections of the Union, in
return for the merchandise consumed in the Great
Valley of the Mississippi, where it would again
perform the same offices. But, by the Bank of the
United States and the State banks, inflating the pa-
per circulation, the ?pecie was kept out of view^ by
which the Bank was enabled to draw from New
Orleans, Kentucky, Ohio, and Pittsburg, such large
amounts.. It shows, also, the rapid increase, un-
lti it had amounted to moie in ea^h of the two last
years, than is estimated to be received from the
sale of public lands this year.
Whilst this piocess was regularly carried on by
the Bank, the taxing power was aho going on; and
how did the paper of the State banks stand with this
institution? It will be seen by the following table,
prepared from the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, made to Congress in 1838.
A TABLE showing the rate of discount at Phila-
delphia on the paper of the best banks of the
Southern and Western States, from 1821 to
1831, inclusive, a period of eleven years during
the existence of the Bank of the United States;
and also the rate of premium paid by the Bank
lor gold and silver, from 1824 to 1831 inclu-
sive:

This table shows how the Bank of the United
States influenced the paper circulation of the States.
The depreciation of the pap«r of the best State
bankt, and in the same sections of the Uaion from
which it drew such large amounts ot specie, is con-
clusive as (0 the way in which it regulated the cur-
rency. It proves that the paper of the Bank was
the standard by which all the paper was tried, and
that when the Bank had somewhat recovered from
its difficulties in 1820, &c after 1824, it kept receiv-
ing gold and silver as it increased the quantity
drawn from the States. These two facts, prove
conclusively the demand it had for fpecie, and that
its paper wa  gradually sinking below the value of
gold and silver, until, in 1831, it was five per
cent. Add this difference between gold and silver
and the paper of the Bank, to the difference be-
tween the paper of the Bank of the United States
and the State banks, and you have, as in the last
column, the true discount of the paper of the State
banks from gold and silver, in 1831, at the counter
of the great regulator. This was the condition of
things, in the moot prosperous existence of the
Bank, and before the public deposites were re-
moved.
What was the price of produce during these
Bank operations? I refer to the following state*
ment for an answer:
