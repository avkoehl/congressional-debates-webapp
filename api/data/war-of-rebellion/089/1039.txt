Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Scouts from Richmond report, via City Point, that on Friday and Saturday of last week Rodes' division, of Early's command, passed through Richmond on the way to Petersburg; cannot say that it is destined for Petersburg or farther south; also that Jeff. Davis is very sick, and was not expected to live. Early has still left in the Valley Wharton's division (Breckinridge's old), and Rosser's and Imboden's cavalry. Two refugees from Petersburg that came into the lines of the Ninth Army Corps, near Battery No. 1, last night, report that a division of infantry passed over the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to Petersburg on Friday last; cannot say that it went farther south than Petersburg; also report that Jeff. Davis died on Saturday evening last at his residence in Richmond. This was currently reported in Petersburg yesterday, and generally believed. No news from Savannah, except a report that it had been occupied by Sherman.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. BABCOCK.
