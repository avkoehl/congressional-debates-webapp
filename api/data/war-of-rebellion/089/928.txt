General MEADE:

General Spaulding with his regiment, is at his camp near Fort Clarke. Colonel Tippin, with the other troops, including the Regular Engineer Battalion, is with General Miles. I have just sent to have them brought in ahead of everything. The stragglers of the Second Corps are with General Gibbon; those of the Fifth Corps are in the intrenchments on the front of the First Division. I will send word to Colonel Spaulding what you want and direct him to report at once in person at your headquarters.

Major-General MEADE:

A detachment of the cavalry went down the Vaughan road this morning as far as Mrs. Hargrave's, near Quaker road; found considerable force of cavalry there. About 9 a.m. he heard artillery firing. The people of the country said they had heard it since daylight. For half an hour it was quite rapid. The report states that the direction was that of Dinwiddie Court-House, but a staff officer who has just returned gives me information that makes the direction about that of Hicksford, or that vicinity. The staff officer informs me the cavalry report having heard the firing continuously with intervals since then.
