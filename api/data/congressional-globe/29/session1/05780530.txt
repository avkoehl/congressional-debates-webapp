THE OHIO RIVER BELOW THE FALLS,
Mr. TIBBATTS demanded a separate question, j
and the yeas and nays, on the following item;
which were ordered:
" For the improvement of the Ohio river below 1
the fails, at Louisville, and of the Mississippi, Mis-
souri, and Arkansas rivers, $240,000." :
Mr. G. W. JONES inquired of ihe Speaker !
whether it would be in order further to divide the j
item, so as to take a separate question on each '
river?
The SPEAKER said it would not bo in order.
Mr. G. S. HOUSTON said he thought that the
Speaker had misapprehended the purport of the
new rule.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks not. This
is one item m the bill—one appropriation. If the
gentleman will designate how much of that appro-
priation 13 to be applied to one river, or how much
to another, the Chair would then be disposed to
decidc that a further division might be made. As
it is, the Chair decides that it is not in order again
to divide the item.

sulted as follows:
