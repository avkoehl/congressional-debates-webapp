respects. As the case now presents itself, it sems to me more appropriate to await your pleasure and to appear at the head of my troops, but if there be any matter on which you desire to see me personally I will hasten upto see you. I have marched from Fichmond slowly on purpose to spare the men and by reason of the very hot waether, but I can assure you all are in good order and condition for serenade, reviews, or fighting.

With sincere respect, your friend and servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report my arrival at camp near the Washington road, three miles north of Alexandria. All my army should be in camp here by to-day. The Fifteenth Corps, the last to leave Richmond, camped last night at the Occoquan. I have seen the order for the review in the papers, but Colonel Sawyer says it is not here in official form. I am old fashioned and prefer to see orders through some other channel, but if that be the new fashion, so be it. I will be all ready by Wednesday, though in the rough. Troops have not been paid for eight or ten months, and clothing may be bad, but a better set of legs and arms cannot be displayed on this continent. Send me all orders and letters you may have for me, and let some one newspaper know that the vandal Sharman is encamped near the canal bridge half way between the Long Bridge and Alexandria to the west of the road, where his friends, if any, can find him. Through in disgrace he is untamed and unconquered.

As ever, your field,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, May 19, 1865.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN, U. S. Army,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I am just in receipt of yours of this date. The order for review was only published yesterday, or rather was only ready for circulation at that time and was sent to you this morning. I will be glad to see you as soon as you can come to the city. Can you not come in the evening or in the morning? I want to talk to you upon matters about which you feel sore-I think justly so, but which bear some explanation in behalf of those who, you feel, have inflicted the injury.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
