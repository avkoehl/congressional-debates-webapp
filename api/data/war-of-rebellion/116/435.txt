Assistant Secretary of War.

NASHVILLE, TENN., April 9, 1862.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN:

Several prominent disunionists have been arrested. It would exert a decided influence to send them beyond the limits of the State. Where shall I send them? All is working well beyond my most sanquine expectations.
