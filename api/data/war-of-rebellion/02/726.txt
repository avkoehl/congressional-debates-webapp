HAGERSTOWN, June 26, 1861.

[General McCALL:]

MY DEAR GENERAL: If I can get permission to go over into Virginia, I intend to cross the river and offer battle to the insurgents. As the regulars and Rhode Island regiment and the battery have been taken from me, I will require all the force now here, and must leave the Pennsylvania line unguarded. Please inform me how many men you could throw forward and how soon.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

R. PATTERSON,
