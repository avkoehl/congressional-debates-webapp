HDQRS. TROOPS FROM FIRST SUB-DIST. OF SOUTH KANSAS,In the Field, Hickman Mills., Mo., October 14, 1864.

Captain GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: In compliance with instructions from the major-general commanding the District of South Kansas, I have left 800 men at Fort Scott, including the stragglers, and 200 at Mound City. I am satisfied by reliable information received that the rebel force which captured the train at Cabin Creek is at the present time between Forts Gibson and Scott, and I would suggest that as soon as the interest of the public service will admit of it a force be sent to Fort Scott, as there is a large amount of Government stores at that post that may fall into the hands of the rebels if not properly attended to.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. JENNISON,

Colonel Fifteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, Commanding.

PAOLA, KANS., October 14, 1864.

[Major-General CURTIS:]

GENERAL: I am here, having come the sixty-miles from Fort Scott in twenty-four hours. My stock is pretty tired, and I propose to rest till daybreak to-morrow morning, unless I get orders to move. I think I shall reach the front quicker by this delay, as both horses and men need rest. I have 900 men and six pieces of artillery, two 6-pounder field pieces and four howitzers. My command is all mounted, well armed, have plenty of ammunition, and is freezing for a fight under our old once again. In haste.

Truly, your friend.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel, &amp;c.
