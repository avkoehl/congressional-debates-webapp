Commanding Second Corps:

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 5, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

I think a little change in the disposition you suggest would be desirable. Instead of two brigades in rear of Fort Rice i would suggest one in rear of Fort Morton, where the ground is favorable, and the same reserve available for Haskell, and the other brigade in rear of Rice, this last to furnish garrisons for the rear line. With the second line at Fort Sedgwick occupied Fort Rice could be readily re-enforced.

Major-General.
