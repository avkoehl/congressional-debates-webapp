twenty-six million dollars and a loss of coin
amounting to nearly eight million and a half.
During this period the country was almost bank-
rupt, but our foreign indebtedness was consid-
erably increased by sending stocks abroad to
pay for goods.
The passage of the tariff of 1842 was not
effected without a struggle, and its salutary
operation only began to be manifested in 1843.
'' Polk, Dallas, and Shunk and the tariff of
1842" carried the State of Pennsylvania in
1844, and the tariff of 1846, the Walker tariff,
destructive and anti-American in its provisions,
was the result. The repeal of the bill of 1842
was a blow to the industry of the country that
might have been fatal to its life. It retarded
the development of our industries; butthe fam-
ine in Ireland, which called for a large amount
of our breadstuffs in 1847 and 1848, and the
discovery of gold in California, warded off the
blow and saved us from its evil effects until
1850 and 1851. In these two years fully onethird
of the manufacturing establishments built up
under the tariff of 1842 fell under the hammer
of the sheriff. In the six years following 1842
our imports and exports compared as follows :
Imports. Exports.
Goods. Coin. Goods. Coin.
81,078,230,388 $73,211,715 $1,118,010,752 $42,637,056
42,637,056 1,078,230,388
$30,574,659 $39,730,304
Showing an excess of exportations of our
products amounting to nearly forty million dol-
lars and a gain of over thirty and a half mil-
lion dollars in coin. It is well known that the
country was never so prosperous in its history
as it was during the operation of the tariff of
1842. Wealth was created rapidly. It was
under the protection this bill afforded that the
manufacture of railroad iron was established
in the country, aud many other branches of
industry sprung up. Labor was adequately
rewarded ; a market was created for our sur-
plus produce at home, and all kinds of manu-
factured goods were cheapened by the intro-
duction of machinery in their production,
foreign imports increased from $98,258,700,
in 1840, to $148,638,704, in 184&
In 1850, under the operation of the bill of
1846, the check in our progress commenced,
and from 1850 to 1861 the balance of trade was
uniformly against us. The large production of
gold at home aided us considerably; but even
that, wonderful as it was, could not save us from
the impending crisis which culminated in 1857,
spreading ruin broadcast over the land. During
these twelve years the imports and exports were
as follows:

•5176,928,616 $121,551,979
Showing an excess of imports in goods of
nearly four hundred and seventy-seven million
dollars, and a loss of nearly four hundred and
twenty-five million dollars in coin in a period
of twelve years, making an average of upward
of thirty-four million four hundred thousand
dollars annually. We all know the total pros-
tration of all branches of business except shav-
ing from 1857 to 1861, the years immediately
preceding the rebellion. But what else could
be expected from such a disastrous govern-
mental policy? And yet, sir, our Special Com-
missioner of Revenue has had the audacity to
print in his reports, as one of his philosophical
deductions, that governmental laws or govern-
mental policy has no effect upon the industry
and progress of the country. Let us hope, sir,
that we have done with his philosophizing, and
that his reports will soon become as obsolete
as his Treatise upon Familiar Science.
Mr. Chairman, the review of the operations
upon the trade of the country of the several
tariff laws has now brought us to the period
of the rebellion. During the four years from
1862 to 1SG6 our workshops were in full opera-
tion and wealth was accumulated very rapidly.
But in the absence of the usual articles of
export, among which cotton had held the lead-
ing place, and because of the large supply of
labor drawn into the Army, the balance of
trsidc was necessarily very largely against us.
We lost all the gold produced at home and
nearly three hundred million dollars in national
bonds beside. This result, while the life of
the nation was at stake, could not be avoided.
The imports and exports, calculated in coin,
as near as the variable premiums in gold would
permit, in four years were as follows :
Imports. Exports.
Goods. Coin. Goods. Coin.
{.1,045,933,8S7 846,330,146 8583,499.534 $224,782,920
583,499,534 46,330,146
§462,434,353
$178,452,774
The excess of importations here shown was
balanced by a loss of nearly one hundred and
seventy-eight and a half million dollars in coin,
and nearly two hundred and eighty-four mil-
lion in bonds. This was a heavy drain, but
under the circumstances quite unavoidable.
But notwithstanding this drain, which took
place during the rebellion, all our workshop®
were busy day and night. Every man was at
work. The great destruction of property in
some sections only served to create a demand
for more in others, and the nation at large
never created wealth so rapidly as during that
unhappy period; and it was this fact that
enabled the country to take the bonds and
furnish the means to sustain itself.
Had the tariff been revised in the interest
of our home producers immediately upon the
close of the rebellion, the logical conclusion
must be that the stagnation of business through
which we have passed and are passing would
not have occurred, the prosperity of the coun-
try would have continued unchecked, and we
should have been richer by $300,000,000 than
we now are. Further, the outward flow of
coin would have been checked, which would
have brought about resumption of specie pay-
ments ero this."
We have now readied the last four years,
during which the steady decline in gold has
operated much as the compromise tariff of 1832
on its downward scale operated on the trade
of the country of that period. Our duties are
found to be less and less protective as the price
of gold declines. Manufacturers have econo-
mized, producers have cut off every possible
expense, and nothing is left to attack now but
the wages of labor. Premising that the figures
I now give are from the Bureau of Statistics, let
us see how the last four years settle :
Imports. Exports.
Goods. Coin. Goods. Coin.
81,605,515.981 $66,766,811 $1,139,519,549 $264,280,094
1,139,519,549 66,766,811
$465,996,432
$197,513,883
We have here an excess of imports, valued
in coin, of nearly five hundred million dollars,
and a loss of nearly two hundred million dol-
lars in gold. This is what is going on at this
moment; and while our great production of
the precious metals has saved us thus far it
has only postponed inevitable trouble unlsss
the balance of trade be turned in our favor at
once, or kept within the limits of the bullion
we can spare. We do not wish to keep all our
gold at home, but we must retain a greater
portion of it than we have heretofore, or give
up the hope of a resumption of specie pay-
ments that will last.
Sir, it is an admitted fact that the universal
stagnation in business that prevailed through-
out all commercial nations during the past two
or three years was caused, in a great measure,
by the failure of crops. ;
Lest I be called to account by a close observer,
let me briefly allude to the effect that the failure
in crops, experienced since the rebellion, has
had upon international trade. In Europe the
want of cheap food was felt more keenly than
in this country. Especially in England was
this the case. In lhat country the high price
of food necessitated the practice of great econ-
omy^ especially among the working classes,
Previous to these failures only about one half
tho wages received were spent in purchasing
food, but when provisions advanced in price
food required full two thirds of the earnings.
Thus the high prie3 of food, by cutting off the
ability of the masses to purchase and use the
ordinary manufactures of England, caused an
accumulation of those articles and a, general
prostration of business. To. such an extent
were prices cheapened by this accumulation of
stock that in some branches of business nearly
one half the factories were closed for a time, or
worked on short time. In the1' black district''
more than half the iron establishments were
closed, and up to one year ago but little more
than half were in operation. In fact, hungry
Europe produced a large surplus of manufac-
tures over their own wants, and these famine-
cheapened fabrics, owing to the want of ade-
quate protection to our American industry after
the close of the war, flooded this country, caus-
ing almost the same stagnation that existed
abroad.
The high price of food did not increase wages
in Europe as it did in this country, and our
manufactures at once felt this disadvantage
also. Under such circumstances it was im-
possible for European nations producing largo
surplus manufactures to retrieve themselves
until more abundant crops reduced the price
of food and gave the people the ability to con-
sume more largely of their products. The
United States were differently situated. Not-
withstanding the discharge of hundreds of thou-
sands of men from Army and Navy who were
ready to work if work had been provided them,
we imported hundreds of millions of the abso-
lute necessaries of life, which we could have
produced at home had the tariff been adjusted
to the interest of our productive industry. To
have produced at home only one half these im-
ports would have filled our workshops and fac-
tories with these idle hands, and our country,
notwithstanding the high price of food and
labor, would have been three years ago, and
would now be, enjoying a degree of prosperity
unexampled in the history of nations.
* Sir, it is an undeniable fact that all suspen-
sions of specie payment that have occurred in
time of peace in this country arose entirely
from a drain of coin caused by excessive im-
portations under free trade or low duties. It
is also an undeniable fact that the banks have
never resumed without causing a great pros-
tration of business, unless the drain of coin
was checked by first giving adequate protection
to our industry, and causing at least a portion
of the coin we lost to flow back again. Con-
sult the financial history of the past fifty years.
Take the protective periods, from 1825 to 1838
and from 1843 to 1849, twenty-one years, and
compare the imports with the exports of coin.
The imports were $210,435,170, while the ex-
ports were $110,136,533, leaving a gain for
the twenty-one years of $91,298,637. During
the period of twenty-one years, under free
trade and low duties, our exports were
$798,146,637, and our imports $188,180,925,
showing a loss of coin to the country, chargeable
to free trade and low duties, of $609,965,712.
This brings us up to 1862, during^vhich and
the three years following we lost $178,452,674,
by reason of the rebellion ; but adding this
loss to that caused by free trade^ we have a
grand loss of coin amounting to $788,418,380,
together with not less than $700,000,000 ol
national and other bonds, making the
aggregate of no less a sum than $1,448,418,dot)
lost to tho country for the want of adequate
protection to our industry; of ^ch °n'y
$178,452,674 in coin, and
in bonds, in the aggregate $462,4d2,674, ai t
chargeable to the rebellion. The Special Com-
missioner of Revenue estimates tJle ®®ou" . ,
bonds held abroad at $1,000,000,000, wmch
would make it $300,000,000 worse.
