GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA,, ARMY OF THE OHIO, Numbers 84. Raleigh, N. C., June 13, 1865.

The time has arrived when I must bid farewell to many of my old comrades of the Army of the Ohio, and doubtless the time will soon come when we all must separate. It is a farewell tinged with no feeling of sadness, save for the loss of our brave comrades who have fallen. Our throughts at parting are of duty faithfully done, of hardships and dangers bravely met, of batters fought and victories won, of our glorious Union saved from destruction and more firmly re-enstablished on the basis of freedom for all, of dear homes and friends to which we are returning, rendered tenflod more dear by the price it has cost us to preserve them, and of the grateful welscome that awaits us among our friends and contrymen.
