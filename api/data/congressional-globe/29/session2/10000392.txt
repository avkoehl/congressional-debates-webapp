APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Feb. 13,
29th Cong 2d Sess.
The Mexican War—Mr. Seaman.
Ho. or Reps.
eventually to be divided, defining their boundaries,
and fixing the number of inhabitants that should
be required antecedent to the admission of each
into the Union, it provides " that the constitution
" and government so to be formed (in any of the
' States of the territory) should be republican, and
'in conformity to the principles contained in these
'articles." If the State of Virginia was dissatis-
fied with any of the provisions of this ordinance,
here was the time for her to manifest it. But in-
stead of this, the fifth article, which in its scope
embraces all the others, is solemnly ratified. This,
sir, is not the only evidence of the assent of this
State and the whole Union to this organic law. On
the 7th day of August, 1789, among the first acts
of the first Congress under the Constitution, is to
be found one giving full effect to it, and adapting
the same to the Constitution of the United States.
At the ensuing session, m 1800, the Indiana Ter-
ritory was organized, and a government establish-
eu, (without dissent on the part of any member,)
in alt respects similar to that provided by the or-
dinance of 1787; and the inhabitants of the terri-
tory were entitled to, and enjoyed all and singular
the rights, privileges, and advantages granted and
secured by it. In 1805 the Indiana Territory was,
by an act of Congress, divided into two separate
governments, the one retaining the old name, the
other denominated the Territory of Michigan. All
the provisions of the ordinance were ingrafted upon
it. In 1809 the Indiana Territory was again di-
vided into two distinct governments, the one re-
taining the same name, the other being called the
lerritory of Illinois; and the principles of the or-
dinance were incorporated into the act making this
division. These several acts were sanctioned by
southern members, and approved by Presidents
Washington and Jefferson, both Virginians, per-
fectly conversant with the conditions of the ces-
sion, the rights of Virginia and the South, and the
provisions of the Constitution. In 1836 the ter-
ritory of Wisconsin was established, and the con-
ditions of the ordinance, without opposition from
any quarter, were imposed upon her people. Thus
it will be perceived, that on this subject, so far as
the Northwestern Terntory is concerned, the action
ot Congress has been stable and uniform. But
notwithstanding this array of fixed facts, we are
told, at this late day, that " the ordinance was in-
consistent with all the conditions of the cession
of Virginia, was inconsistent and proscWptive to
hei and the southern States, and was an assump-
in.u F?wcr- Gentlemen have not carefully j
read the history of the country, or they would not I
have fallen into such errors, It is perfectly clear i
that the anti-slavery feature originated with Mr. '
Jefferson, that the ordinance prevailed by southern
votes, and that it has ever since been sustained by
southern men. It is too late to question its consti-
tutiona lty; too late to doubt the correctness of its
principles. Let western men sustain their treat
ciarter, and extend its benign influences to other
w'if"eS' ,US,lncrcase prosperity and
happiness of the whole nation, and not subserve the
interests of any particular section of the country.
Momlfr ?n°e Aidu?,ed by the gen'leman from
South Carolina, [Mr. Burt,] to show that the ordi-
wi«h!7arStiT0t ®°U?lstent with the interests and
wishes of the inhabitants of the northwestern ter-
thnsJ'-,! ent're.'y different conclusions from
men?aHtyVofC,h fflrnVed' through the instru-

, / na Terntol7>'<■ appears that, in 1804
lesolutions were adopted asking a qualified sus-
pension of the anti-slavery proviso in the ordi-
nance, the movers believing, as they assert that it
the territory°dAfLVe °f ,benefif and advantage to
territory. Afterwards resolves of similar tenor
were adopted by the legislative council of theTer-
fn S'l, forwarded to Congress, but the prayer
in neither case was granted. It is a notorious fit
that in the early stages of the territorial govern-
ment, notwithstanding the prohibitory character
of the ordinance, slaves were imported into In-
diana and retained there in service. We know
how easily our sympathies are enlisted in behalf
W ft i! ^ we constantly associate, and
whTn0[heni^eSefylrPathies-v"lrP the judgment
areinvolveH Wi ,°Ur fncnds and neighbors
aie involved. What else could have, in this in-
Xtory >e,The ^ W ?d authorities of this
temtoiy ? I he climate and the country forbade
slavery, and yet many of the most intelligent of
its citizens appeared to favor it. But, when the
attention of the people was directed to the evil,
and their sober judgment appealed to, what was
the result? The contcst, (as we have been in-
formed by the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Pet-
tit,) arose in the election of delegates to Congress
from that Territory. Mr. Randolph, from Vir-
ginia, and attorney general of the Territory, sus-
tained by General Harrison, the governor, was
the candidate of those desiring the suspension or
entire repeal of the slavery portion of the ordi-
nance. Mr. Jennings, from Pennsylvania, was
the candidate of the opponents of this contempla-
ted suspension or repeal; and, although the attor-
ney general was supported by the influence and
patronage of the Government, yet he did not re-
ceive one-third of the votes given. When the
gentleman from South Carolina was presenting
these, slavery movements of the inhabitants of the
Territory to our consideration, I was forcibly struck
with the danger of leaving this question open,
undetermined, until the territory'was acquired,
and a State organized for admission, and Congress
should be called on to establish a territorial gov-
ernment, or admit the State. More especially if
what we have learned be true, that there are slaves
there already.
I will not stop, Mr. Chairman, to combat the
argument that we are attempting in advance to
forestall public opinion, or endeavoring to bind a
future Congress. It is not improper, nor unfre-
quent, for Congress in advance to declare its opin-
ions upon great and important subjects, and, judg-
ing from the tenor of the State resolutions that
have been presented, we are forced to believe that
public opinion upon this question is m advance of
us. If it is a mere abstraction, our southern
friends should not, on that account, find fault
with it.
Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to institute in-
vidious comparisons between theNorth and South,
nor to attempt to portray the evils of slavery. I
will content myself with reading from the October
number of the Southern Quarterly Review a table
carefully compiled from the census returns from
1810 to 1840, inclusive, to show the comparative
increase of population in the non-slaveholding
States, and decrease in the slaveholding States.

The comparative decrease in the slaveholding
States is very great. It requires no comments.
To what cause can it be ascribed ?
I do not subscribe to the opinion advanced by a
northern member that the question of political
power is alone involved, and that we care not how
many slaves are carried into this territory, provi-
ded the political power is not thereby increased.
I believe the general happiness, prosperity, and
advancement of the whole Union, morally and po-
litically, forbid its expansion, it might be detri-
mental to the best interests of the nation, if the
Government was controlled either by the East or
the South; and perhaps it is wisely decreed that
the West should hold in its hands the balance of
power. It is not for our interest that eithershould
command the Senate, because we know the power
of patronage too^ well not to fear it. It is most
wise to let the different sections of the Union re-
main as they are, neither having a preponderance,
and each, to some extent at least, checking the
other.
. The South should be satisfied with the admis-
:j sion of Texas into the Union, with power to form
j four more States in her territory. This in time
will be done; and where is the counterpoise in the
North or ^Vest? One State may be formed in
Oregon, one west of Iowa and Missouri, and one
north of Wisconsin and Iowa, and all the free ter-
ritory that is inhabitable is exhausted. Upper
California we ought, and in all probability will
have, and it should be free. Besides other con-
siderations, it is far better adapted to the pursuits
of northern men than to slave labor. Then, why
exclude free labor? Admit the slave, and you
expel the free laborer; for it is folly to think that
our northern men will emigrate to the most invi-
ting territory in the world, where they know they
will be compelled to labor side by side with the
slave.

SPEECH OF MR. H. I. SEAMAN",
OP NEW YORK,
In the House of Representatives,
February 13, 1847.
The Three Million Bill and the Wilmot Proviso
being under consideration in Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union 
Mr. SEAMAN said; Mr. Chairman: Some of
the measures of this Congress are as extraordi-
naiy as they are important. The acquisition of
territory by annexation and compromise—a change
in our system of keeping and disbursing the pubhc
moneys—an entire remodelling of our revenue
laws—a war of conquest, and a national debt, are
among its prominent features. We have escaped
a war with England, and are engaged m a war
with Mexico. Some of these measures are crave
and great questions. As I have and am to°take
my part, with others, in disposing of these meas-
ures, I claim the right to give my views to this
House and to the country upon some of them.
i do not expect to bring to the discussion of these
^P1.?3 anything that is new or interesting; but I
shall speak freely, and, I trust, honestly.
The objects contemplated by this bill are of mo-
mentous importance. It is said by some of its
friends, that it involves the grave question of peace
| or war, and by others that of freedom or slavery.
;j £<ever, since the organization of the Government,
• have subjects of a more grave character than
j these been presented to the consideration of Con-
i gress. And I believe that posterity will point to
1 the twenty-ninth Congress as an era in our na-
