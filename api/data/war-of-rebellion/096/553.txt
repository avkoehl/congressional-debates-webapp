CITY POINT, VA., February 13, 1865-10.30 a. m.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Winchester, Va.:

I do not care your moving until the weather and roads are such as to give assurance of overcoming all obstacles except those interposed by the enemy.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

MARTINSBURG, February 13, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Can't you let me have the Eighteenth Connecticut here? My force is very weak, and the duty hard on the men.

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, February 13, 1865.

Brigadier-General SEWARD,

Martinsburg, W. Va.:

Will send you Eighteenth Connecticut as soon as I have troops to relieve them.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,February 13, 1865.

Major-General CROOK,

Commanding Department of West Virginia:

Every particle of information which I have goes to show that the rebel cavalry, instead of contemplating any movements, are being furloughed to go home on short leaves. It is so in all this country, and in the mountains in the west. Echols, I think, is at or near Dublin Depot collecting supplies. Would it not be best to put some one in the place of Wilkinson? He is certainly unfitted for his position. I think Kelley would like to have General Sullivan.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that the Secretary of War approves of your recommendation of February 7, 1865 (made upon General Butler's report), that what is known as the Naval Brigade be turned over to the Navy, and the officers and men with it be returned to their regiments as soon as their places can be supplied by the Navy, and that the two chartered vessels now with this brigade be discharged.

I am, sir, &amp;c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,
