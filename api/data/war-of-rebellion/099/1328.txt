RALEIGH, March 5, 1865.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President, &amp;c.:

Mr. PRESIDENT: This military department having been merged by the General-in Chief as a natural consequence of the present condition in the command of General Johnston, it fairly terminates the temporary command to which you mind as forcibly as I could express them, I beg that you will relieve me from the embarrassing position. I seek no command or position, and only desire to be ordered to await assignment to duty at some point in Georgia or Alabana. The circumsatates constaining me to make this request are painfoul in the extreme, but I cannot blindly disregard them. You will find many abler servat to fill my place, but I feel the country has had none more sincerely devoted.

I am, dear sir, as ever, you friend and servant.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
