CUMBERLAND, December 13, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Kernstown, Va.:

General Kelley reports that Major-General Rosser, with 2,000 cavalry, is now at Moorefield. He came up in the vicinity of Romney, but was driven back by the storm. His men are shod and carry two extra shoes, evidently prepared for a raid here or hereabouts. This information comes from various sources and is apparently reliable.

GEORGE CROOK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 13, 1864.

Major-General CROOK:

Granting that the information is true, how many men would be required by General Kelley? A scouting party was sent to Moorefield this morning. Rosser's command was at Timberville on Saturday last, according to reports of deserters. Please answer at once.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Kernstown, Va.:

Two regiments will be sufficient, one of cavalry and one of infantry, sent to this place. Or a brigade of cavalry sent from Winchester to the vicinity of Moorefield will accomplished the same thing. Charges have been preferred against Colonel Latham.

Major-General.
