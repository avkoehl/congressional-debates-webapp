Mr. FERRY, ot Michigan. I move that
the Senate proceed to She- consideration of the
House bill No. 2942. I will state that bili has
passed the House and been leferred to the
Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
and they have reported it back, and it is on the
Calendar. The cliauinun of the committee
holds a letter of the Secretary of the Treasury
Stating its object. I ask that the bill be read,
and that, the letter of the Secretary of the
Treasury also be read.
Mr. BLAIR. I move to take up the con-
ference report on the steamboat bill.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I hope the
Senator from Missouri wi!l pause for one
moment.
The-PRESIDENT pro- tempore. The ques-
tion is on the motion of the Senator from
Michigan to proceed to the consideration of
the bill indicated by him.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 2942) for,the con-
struction of a custom-house, bonded ware-
house, and postoffice at Port Huron, Michigan.
The Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds reported the bill with an amendment
to insert after the word "completed," in liue
ten, the words "upon plans to be previously
made and approved by the Secretary of the
Treasuryso as to read :
That the ijeoretary of the Treasury be, and he
hereby is, authorized and directed to purchase, at
private sale or by condemnation, in pursuance of the
statute of the State of Michigan, a suitable lot of
ground in theeity of Port Huron,Stateof Michigan,
and to cause to be erected thereon abuitding suitable
for the accommodation of the custom-house, bonded
warehouse, and other<3overninent offices in that city ;
the lot of land and the building thereon, when com-
pleted, upon plans to be previously made and ap-
proved by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall not
exceed the cost of $200,000: Provided, That no
money to be appropriated for this purpose shall be
available until a valid title to the land shall be
vested in the United States, and until the State of
Michigan shall cede its jurisdiction over the same

thereof.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. 1 will state
that this bill and one other for Nashville,
Tennessee, were reported, as the last bills
acted on by the Committee on Public Build-
ings and Grounds, without recommendation,
but with the statement that if any more bills
should be passed at this session, these two
were, in the opinion of the committee, of the
highest merit. Since that report was made
the Secretary of the Treasury has sent a letter
to the committee which I ask to have read.
The Secretary read as follows:
Treasury Department,
Office oi' the Seceetary, June 7,1872.
Sir: It is now about two years sinco the subjeei of
erecting a custom-house at Port Huron, Michiga n,

mended as one of the places at which work shnuM
be undertaken without much delay. Up to^ thu
time nothing has been done. An officer of the
Department has been at Port Huron recently, and
reports that the business is rapidly increasing, while
the accommodations for its proper performance .no
very meag-er. Upon this report aad or.her fact*
known to me Tffel it to be inyduty to so far depan
from the view heretofore expressed as to advise au
appropriation for the construction of public build-
ings at that place. She estimated cost, as heretofore
given, is $200,000-.
