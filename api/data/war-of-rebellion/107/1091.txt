Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

The scouts from Morrisville Post-Office and Stafford Springs report no enemy, except a small squad of about seventy or eighty men going to Dumfries day before yesterday. The patrols to Greenswich and Buckland Mills met no rebels. The patrols to Warrenton, however, met a squad of twenty-five guerrillas near Auburn Mills. Watching them closely they saw then unite with another squad of about thirty rebels about three miles this side of Warrenton and followed them up to that place. They learned that Mosby is well again and in command of these guerrillas. There is a rebel signal station opened on Watery Mountain, but I have no office who understands the code of the enemy.

Major-General.
