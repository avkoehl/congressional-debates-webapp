Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A rebel deserter from Eighth Alabama Regiment, Sanders' brigade, Mahone's division, who left his picket-line last night and arrived here this morning, reports no changes in the enemy's position. Mahone's division is posted in the trenches from their right to left in the following order: Wright, Mahone, Sanders, Harris, Finegan. The brigades of this division are very much reduced in number. This man states that it is well understood that there are but 500 men in Sanders' brigade, and that it is as large as the brigades of the division will average. They have lost severely in the recent battles. The informant also states that Anderson's and Law's brigades, of Field's division, are lying in a ravine between the lead-works and plank road. General Butler reported these two brigades gone from his front several days ago.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. MCENTEE,

They do not know the strength of guard with train, or whether they run regular or not. They think that most of their supplies are brought by South Side and Danville railroads.
