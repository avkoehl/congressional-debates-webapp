THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 22,
this it appears that Lieutenant Stanley, of the
United States steamer Wyandott, captured the
bark William, with about five hundred and fifty
African negroes on board, on the south side of
Cuba, near the Isle of Pines, and brought her
into Key West, on the 12th instant. Those ne-
groes have doubtless been delivered to the mar-
shal; and, with those captured on board the Wild-
fire, will make the number m his custody about
one thousand. More may be daily expected at
Key West, which, both on account of a deficiency
of water and provisions, and its exposure to the
yellow fever, is one of the worst spots for an Af-
rican negro depot which could be found on the
coast of the United States.
JAMES BUCHANAN.
The message was referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary, and. with the accompanying doc-
uments, ordered to be printed.
The SPEAKER also, by unanimous consent,
laid before the House a message from the Presi-
dent of the United States, in answer to a resolu-
tion passed on the 20th of March last calling for
a detailed statement of the expenditure from the
appropriations made during the first session of the
Thirty-Fourth Congress, and the first and second
sessions of the Thirty-Fifth Congress, for legal
assistance and other necessary expenditures in the
disposal of private land claims in California, and
for the service of special counsel and other ex-
traordinary expenses of such land claims, amount-
ing ill all to $114,000, transmitting a report of the
Attorney General, withaccompanymgdocuments,
containing the information required; which were
laid upon the table,and ordered to be printed.
Mr. SHERMAN moved that the rules be sus-
pended, and that the House resolve itself into the
Committee ofthe Whole on the stateof theUnion.
The motion was agreed to.
The rules were accordingly suspended; and the
House resolved itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of theUnion, (Mr. Joiin Coch-
rane in the cluur,) and resumed the consideration
of the
LEGISLATIVE, ETC., APPROPRIATION BILL.
The CHAIRMAN stated the pending question
to be on the motion to strike out, in line one hun-
dred and four, (the clause providing for station-
ery for the House of Representatives) the word
" fifteen," and to insert " three " in lieu thereof;
so as to reduce the amount from $15,000 to §3,000.
Mr. Q.UARLES. Before we proceed, 1 desire
to ask n question ofthe chairman of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means. Ill the portion of the
bill relating to the employment of clerks at $1,800,
which we have passed over, I see that there are
but eleven provided for in the bill. I see, also,
that there is a clerk provided for at §1,800, for
the purpose of taking charge of books voted to
members; and I understand that he is employed
under the law of 1853 and the joint resolution of
lti54. Now, sir, we have no hooks voted to us;
and I desire to ask the chairman of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means whether he has provided
in this bill for the payment of any such clerk'
Mr. SHERMAN. There are fourteen clerks
at |1,800 each, and the bill provides for eleven.
It is usual to pay two or three out of another
fund, which will be under consideration by and
by.
Mr. MAYNARD. I would call the attention
of the committee, in reference to the pending
amendment, to Miscellaneous Document, II. R.
No. 25, of the present session, which is the re-
port of the last Clerk upon the disbursement of
the contingent fund of the House. By reference
to exhibit B, it will be seen that the amount of
stationery furnished during the last session of
Congress to the Postmaster of the House, for the
use of members, was within a fraction of §5,000,
of which nearly J],000 was returned to the Clerk.
It will be seen that the amount furnished for the
Clerk's office was §463 65. The object of the
amendment, reducing the amount from $15,000 to
$3,000, is simply to supply the Clerk with the
means of furnishing stationery for the use of his
office, leaving members to draw commutation in
money, and purchase their own stationery.
To show to what extent this has been done
heretofore, I wilfask members to look at the same
document, page 80. I will not call the names of
members, because I do not wish to be invidious,
and it would not be just to do so; but it will be
seen that, during the last session of Congress, one
gentleman drew money, in commutation, to the
amount of ^14 61, and another $22 25, taking
only $1 95 in stationery; another drew $19 57,
andanother$15 07,and so on. The report shows
that, in point of fact, members drew a very small
portion of the amount in actual stationery; and
at the end of the Clerk's term the surplus sta-
tionery brought here is piled away, as useless lum-
ber, in some room about the Capitol. The object
of the amendment is simply to furnish stationery
enough for the use of the office, and let members
commute stationery, as they do newspapers, in
money, and get the quality that best suits them.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to state the facts
in regard to this stationery matter. By a resolu-
tion of the House, each member has forty-five
dollars for a long session in stationery or money,
and half that for a short session. I prefer to take
it in money, because I can buy better stationery
than they furnish here. Then the various com-
mittees are supplied with stationery. Since the
discussion took place upon this subject the other
day, I have had a formal statement, made out of
the amount of stationery drawn by each commit-
tee during the long session for three Congresses,
and I find that the committees of this House have
been more economical and have drawn less than
was drawn at either of the two preceding Con-
gresses. We have drawn only between seven and
eight hundred dollars; whilst at the previous ses-
sions the amount was between one thousand and
eleven hundred dollars. I send the statement to
the reporters for publication,so as to correct any
misapprehension which exists upon the subject.
It is a small matter.
The following is the statement handed to the
reporters:

* Charged to Hon. J. C. Burch.
The amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. BURNETT. I move to strike out the
whole of line one hundred and four, which is the
appropriation of $15,000 for stationery.
There is a great deal said about stationery here.
I do not intend to reflect upon any member of the
House, or upon any committee, but to speak
merely to the merits of this appropriation of
money. In my judgment, the whole thing is
wrong:. I believe that there is more corruption
and more favoritism connected with these small
funds around the House of Representatives than
perhaps with any other branch of business con-
nected with the entire departments of the Federal
Government. I do not charge it upon any par-
ticular party. When you come to examine the
mode and manner in which this fund is disposed
of, you find that the whole system is wrong, and
it ought to be abolished at once. A  d the reason
for it is this: if we are determined to have this
appropriation here for the benefit of members, in
addition to their present compensation, I say let
them draw the money, and buy their own station
cry wherevor they please; but I say there is no
reason whatever why we should continue, at the
expense of thuF'ederal Government, to supply the
members and employes of the House with sta-
tionery. Then, if we could adopt that system,
let some officer be designated to purchase the sta-
tionery required for the Clerk's and other offices
connected with the House; let him go into the
market and purchase such an amount as may be
necessary, and render his account to the House-
But I hope this appropriation of §15,000 for sta-
tionery for members will be stricken out. I be-
lieve it to be wrong, and I have invariably voted
against it.
The amendment was not agreed to.
Mr. LEACH, of North Carolina, moved to
strike out the one hundred and fifth line, as fol-
lows:
For horses, carriages, and saddle-horses, £6,000.
Mr. LEACH. I move that amendment in good
faith, and I hope this line will be stricken out.
Mr. GROW. Why, that is to carry your
mails.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will state that the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means have reduced this
appropriation from $7,500 to $6,000. This is to
carry our mails, and the cartage is to carry your
books to the Post Office. It is for the purpose of
distributing our mails; and if gentlemen want to
come here every night and get their own mails,
they may then strike out this appropriation.
Mi. BOCOCK. I desire to ask the gentleman
for what purpose these saddle-horses are em-
ployed ?
Mr. SHERMAN. When the gentleman wants
to send an urgent message to the Treasury De-
partment, a messenger will be sent with it on one
of these saddle-horses. Two or three horses are
kept for such purposes.
Mr. BOCOCK. Let me make one remark. In
the last Congress, in some parts of the country,
U was said that these horses and carnages were
kept for Democratic members of Congress to ride.
I know nothing at all about what these horses
and carriages aie for. The gentlemanfromOhio,
however, seems to know all about it, and that is
the reason why I ask him this question.
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes, sir. I did not know
but what members of Congress might be entitled
to use these horses and carriages, and therefore
I inquired about it.
Mr. MOORE, of Kentucky. Did the Demo-
cratic members m the last Congress have these
horses too ? [Laughter.]
Mr. SHERMAN. The appropriation was
larger last year than we have made it in this bill.
Mr. MAYNARD. 1 see the appropriation
here for hordes and carriages is £6,000. It strikes
me that is pretty cxpensne riding.
The amendment was not agreed to.
Mr. BURNETT. I move to strike out line
one hundred and nine, as follows:
"For newspapers. .$'12,500.''
Mr. Chairman, every member present under-
stands how this abuse originated, and why it is
continued; and I deem it unnecessary to repeat
all the reasons why the motion winch 1 have just
made ou^ht to be adopted by the committee.
When the pay of membeis of Congress was eight
dollars per day, the members of this House
adopted several expedients by which they mdi-
