J. A. KENNEDY,

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, August 27, 1861.

JOHN A. KENNEDY, Esq.

Superintendent of Police, New York.

SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two communications* of the 24th instant and to state in reply that your course with regard to the cases of Guthrey and Miles is approved.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, August 28, 1861.

Lieutenant General WINFIELD SCOTT, Washington.

GENERAL: I have the honor herewith to return the papers in the case of Miles and Guthrey which you yesterday referred to this Department and to state in reply that John A. Kennedy, esq., superintendent of police at New York, has represented to this Department that he had caused to be deposited with Colonel Burke at Fort Hamilton the sum of $200 to defray the personal expenses of Miles and also a like sum to defray those of Guthrey which seems to supersede the necessity of making any further provision at this time for those objects.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD.

FORT LAFAYETTE, New York Harbor, August 31, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.

DEAR SIR: I am a tobacco manufacturer of the city of Richmond whose whole business has been done with Nothern commission merchants. At the commencement of these troubles I had a shipment of tobacco seized on the schooner Mary which was afterward released. Feeling some uneasiness about the safety of my goods I went North and was kindly received and well treated.

On my return home I was solicited by Mr. Thomas, a wealthy manufacturer, to return and wind up his business in the Northern cities.
