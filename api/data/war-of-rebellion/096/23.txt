Major General S. W. CRAWFORD,Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

An order was sent by telegraph last evening to Major-General Warren directing that 100,000 pounds of grain be transferred from the Fifth Corps to the Second Cavalry Division. It appears that only forty sacks were transferred. The commanding general desires to be informed why the order was not complied with. It is absolutely necessary that the grain ordered be furnished the cavalry with the least delay practicable.
