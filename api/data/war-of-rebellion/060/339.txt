Several of the regiments of the Second Brigade have made winter quarters at Bealeton. One regiment of this brigade is camped on the railroad between Warrenton and Warrenton Junction. Good camps at that point for a brigade.

Brigadier-General GREGG:

Your division remains at Warrenton until further orders. The orders sent you last night are countermanded. You will please direct Colonel Taylor to send a report by telegraph of the state of the roads and whether it is practicable to send a pontoon train to the Shenandoah River, and also the condition of his command, whether able to return to the Shenandoah or not.

By order:

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Bealeton, January 4, 1864 - 5 p. m.

Captain PARSONS,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Cavalry Corps:

Colonel Taylor has returned to Warrenton. A staff officer just arrived reports for Colonel Taylor that it is utterly impracticable to take pontoons to the Shenandoah. The roads are almost impassable for horsemen. The command is much broken down, and could not move again for a week. The Second Brigade, having left their property at Bealeton, is much exposed in this storm.

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General.
