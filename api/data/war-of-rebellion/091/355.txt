Washington, D. C., October 13, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

(Care of General Augur.)

If you can come here a consultation on several points is extremely desirable. I propose to visit General Grant, and would like to see you first.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Copy to General Augur, who will communicate to General Sheridan if he comes over to Rectortown.

CEDAR CREEK, VA., October 13, 1864-9.30 a.m.

(Received 9.20 a.m. 14th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Your telegram dated 12 m. October 12 received. If any advance is to be made on Gordonsville and Charlottesville, it is not best to send troops away from my command, and I have therefore countermanded the order directing the Sixth Corps to march to Alexandria. I will go over and see General Augur and Colonel Alexander, and communicate with you from Rectortown.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 13, 1864-5 p.m.

(Via Rectortown and Harper's Ferry.)

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Cedar Creek:

The Secretary of War wishes you to come to Washington for consultation, if you can safely leave your command. General Grant's wishes about holding a position up the Valley as a basis against Gordonsville, &amp;c., and the difficulty of wagoning supplies in the winter, may change your views about the Manassas Gap road.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
