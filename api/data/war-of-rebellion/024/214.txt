You need not occupy Kossuth Bridge, but occupy Smith's Bridge with a good regiment until we hear whether any of the enemy have retreated by that route.

Tell the regimental commander to examine very carefully and tell you of the marks. Lee's cavalry has gone to Kossuth and will reconnoiter thence to Bone Yard.
