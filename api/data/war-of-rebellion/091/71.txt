Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you detail a strong guard to escort the army supply trains from Harper's Ferry to Charlestown. The officer commanding the escort will be held strictly to account for the safety of the train until he transfers it to the officer in charge of the escort from Charlestown to the front. The guard detailed from your command will, after the train has been turned over to the cavalry escort that will be at Charlestown, report back to you. The trains should leave Bolvar Heights at daylight to-morrow morning.

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

P. S.- The supply train that you send out here to-morrow will return immediately; it is then to be at once loaded up with three days' supplies, and will be parked inside of Bolivar Heights.

Respectfully,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,September 11, 1864 - 11.45 a. m.

Colonel SCHOONMAKER,

Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: One of General Sheridan's scouts who staid near Martinsburg last night reports to me that the enemy were engaged in tearing up the railroad between Martinsburg and North Mountain, and that he heard the report of small-arms, and that the Opequon is open below you. Please place your main body this side of the Opequon near the stone bridge, keeping light but vigilant pickets out toward Darkesville, North Mountain, and on the other roads. Picket the Opequon lightly down to its mouth. Keep your command strictly on the defensive, for the purpose of rest. Do not remain saddles unless in the presence of the enemy of in case of an attack. Your pickets should be so posted
