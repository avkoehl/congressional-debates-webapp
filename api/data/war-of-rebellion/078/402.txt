HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Knoxville, Tenn., September 18, 1864.

Colonel PALMER,

Commanding Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cav., Trundle's Cross-Roads:

COLONEL: General Manson directs me to inform you that the last seen of Dibrell and Williams they were moving from Big Springs toward Mulberry Gap. Have had no information from General Gillem to-day in reference to the movement of the enemy. We have a picket at Bean's Station and Cobb's Ford. Hope we will be able to give you full information by courier to-morrow morning. It is reported here that Wheeler left from 100 to 200 men in the neighborhood of Dandridge when he passed up on his raid. Probably you may be able to find some of them in the neighborhood of Sevierville.

Very respectfully,. &amp;c.,

N. A. REED,

Aide-de-Camp.
