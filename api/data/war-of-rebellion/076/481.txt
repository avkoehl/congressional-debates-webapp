HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 12, 1864.

General HOWARD:

Meet Generals Thomas and Schofield at my headquarters at 10 a.m. to-morrow. I am just from General Schofield's right. General Cox was out about two miles, and we could see the enemy trying to throw up fresh rifle-pits farther south. I will describe more fully to-morrow.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 12, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. R. TOWNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has occurred in my front during the day. Quite an artillery duel has been kept up, but I have sustained no damage by it. There was quite a heavy infantry fire in my front about 10 o'clock last evening, but I think the cause was more imaginary than real by both parties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

NEAR ATLANTA, GA., August 12, 1864-8 p.m.

Major T. T. ECKERT,

Assistant Superintendent U. S. Military Telegraph:

General Schofield felt forward again to-day for West Point railroad, south of East Point, but without success, finding enemy in earth-works on his front. It is evident that there are more rebels before us than we had supposed. Our artillery annoys them severely, causing their troops to remain in the trenches, as our shells reach over their camp near Atlanta. I have neglected to mention that the bridge over Chattahoochee is done, and trains run to our position. Nothing further from Mobile.

Cipher Operator, U. S. Military Telegraph.

Deserters from the rebel army required by standing orders to be sent north of the Ohio River and discharged, as well as refugees, male and female, escaping from the dangers of civil war at the South, will, on arrival at Cairo or Louisville, be forwarded at the expense of the United States, if unable to pay their own way, to Cincinnati or Saint Louis by water, or to any point not over 100 miles by railroad.

II. Commanding officers at Cairo and Louisville will, through the agents of the Christian Commission or labor agencies, endeavor to put this class of people in the way of honest employment as much as possible.
