THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 1,
rupted, nor was bis judgment obscured. All of
us, although born among freemen and living far
away from that influence which has so unhappily
disturbed our country, might take counsel from
his intelligent alacrity. While others hesitated
ho was prompt. "While others surrendpred to pro-
crastination, he grappled at once with the giant
evil. Such a man was exceptional, and now that
he is dead he deserves exceptional honors.
There are men in history who by a single effort
fix the public attention. A member of Parliament
in the last century was known as "Single-speech
Hamilton." Others have become famous from
the support of a single measure. Perhaps Mr.
Noell may find a place in this class. But no
" "Single-speech Hamilton" could claim the hom-
age which belongs to him.
There have been many in Congress from the
slave States, but he was 'the first in our history
who was inspired to bring in a bill for the aboli-
tion of slavery in a State. Rejecting the palpable
sophistries by which it was sought to postpone
an act of unquestionable justice, and discarding
the idea that wrong was to be dealt with tardily,
gradually, or prospectively, he proposed imme-
diate emancipation. Let it be spoken in his fa-
vor. Let it be carved on his tombstone. His
bill passed the House. It was lost in the Senate.
But it was not lost to his fame. He died without
beholding the fulfillment of his desires; but the
cause with which his name is associated cannot
die.
Among the human benefactors of Missouri, so
rich in natural resources, he mustalways be num-
bered, and his memory will be appreciated there
just in proportion as men discern what contributes
most to the wealth, the character, and the true
nobility of a State. And hereafter, when the pres-
ent conflict is ended and peace once more blesses
our wide-spread land,he will be mentioned grate-
fully with those who saw truly how this blessing
was to be secured, and bravely strove to secure
it. Better in that day to have been a doorkeeper
in the house of freedom than a dweller in the
tents of the ungodly; and what ungodliness can
compare with the ungodliness of slavery, whether
in the lash of the taskmaster or in the speech of
its apologist?
The resolutions were adopted nem. con., and the
Senate adjourned.
