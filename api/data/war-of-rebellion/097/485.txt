station reports 1,500 rebel infantry moving into Petersburg from across the Appomattox. General Wright telegraphs that he has moved down the rebel line to our left and is a mile from Hatcher's Run, and that his rear must be looked after. I do not see that I can do this in view of the above state of my own line. Is there no danger that they will concentrate on this part of their line and deprive Wright and myself of all we have gained?

The enemy have made a series of assaults upon my left advance, which have all been repulsed and we hold all we have taken .

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Rice, April 2, 1865-12.32 p.m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy have assaulted in heavy force, and forced back my left. I fear the whole line will have to fall back, and the enemy get between Wright and me. I should have re-enforcements at once.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

P. S.-We still hold most of the ground and may repulse his assault.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-2 p.m.

General WEBB:

Heavy column of infantry, one and a half miles long, west of lead-works moving northerly. Have been passing for forty minutes. Cannot distinguish whether our men or the enemy's; firing heard a little west of north.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

A column of infantry seven minutes long moved to our left on Pocahontas road. Think they came down on train on new road.
