Major-General GRANT,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

General Foster's condition is such that General Schofield must hasten to relieve him.

General-in-Chief.

NASHVILLE, February 1, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Knoxville:

Major-General Schofield is, by direction of the General-in-Chief, en route from Saint Louis to Knoxville to relieve you, that you may take the benefit of your leave of absence.

By order of Major-General Grant:

KNOXVILLE, February 1, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General GRANGER:

Give instructions for General Willich to watch all the roads from Sevierville to Maryville, and patrol the one by Rockford and Louisville; if he finds the enemy advancing in force on the latter road he will fall back to Louisville or some other secure position, so as not to be cut off. I have no information of any force being nearer to him that Boyd's Creek. I hope to attack this force as soon as possible. You will therefore order Hazen's brigade to march at once to this point, and Sheridan's division to march to Campbell's Station, and await orders.

Send orders to General Willich to guard the fords of he Holston between this point and Loudon, in case he has to fall back; he will

in no case, however, fall back farther than Louisville before he is forced back by superior numbers.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, February 1, 1864.

Major-General GRANGER:

The order directing General Sheridan to move to Campbell's Station and General Hazen to move here is countermanded. Inform General Willich that the emergency for this move is over.
