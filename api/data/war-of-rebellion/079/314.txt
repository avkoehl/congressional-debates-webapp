CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Ringgold:

Return to Chattanooga with one of your brigades at once. I sent you the order last night, but it appears not to have reached you. Answer.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHICKAMAUGA JUNCTION, October 16, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Left Ringgold at 6 o'clock with one brigade, as you directed. Will soon be at Chattanooga.

G. D. WAGNER,

Brigadier-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Whiteside's:

If it is true that the enemy was in Deer head Cove at 10 o'clock today the cavalry should have reported it by this time. That is a point to be settled. It will probably be best to send some scouts down the river. I understand General Bradley has sent a scout in that direction; if not, let it be done.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Commanding DIVISION, Whiteside's:

Send one of your trains to this place to-night to get the rations you need. The brigade with you and the one with General Sprague are the ones that move. The brigade at Bridgeport will not be moved at present.

By command of Major-General Schofield:

G. M. BASCOM,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864 - 6 p. m.

Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Whiteside's:

You will probably remain where you are for to-night. I have no information of the enemy later than this morning, when he was at La Fayette. Be prepared to march at daylight in the morning with all the rations your men can carry.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
