THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 6,
Mr. RICHARDSON desired to be informed by
the Speaker, whether the amendment of the gen-
tleman f<om Mississippi [Mr. Thompson] to the
substitute of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Schenck] proposed to strike out that substitute?
The SPEAKER. It does not. The question
is first on the amendment of the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Schenck] to the amendment of the gen-
tleman from Georgia, [Mr. Toombs,} and on that
question the yeas and navs have been demanded.
Mr. SCHENCK asked that the amendment
might be read. There seemed, he said, to be some
difficulty about it in some parts of the House.
Mr. JONES. I object to the reading. It has
been read often enough.
Mr. CONRAD, (to the Chair.) If the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Ohio should be reject-
ed, will the amendment of the gentleman irom
Georgia he open to amendment ?
The SPEAKER. Clearly not; because the pre-
vious qu'-stion is now in operation.
• Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas, said, there was
a great deal of confusion in the Hall, and many
gentlemen would acknowledge ih t it had been
found impossible to know distinctly what the prop-
ositions were. He desired to know upon what he \\
was about to vote. i
The SPEAKER. In the opinion of the Chair, [j
time will be saved by the reading of the amend- ii
ment. The Chair hopes that no objection will be !j
made. 1
The amendment was again read. j
Mr. WOODWARD moved that the House ad- j,
journ. i
Mr. CARTTER raised the question of order. !
The SPEAKER overruled the point of order, j
And the question having been taken, the House :
refused to adjo"urn. ;
The question then recurrcd on agreeing to the i
ameidment. i
The yeas and nays were ordered. I
The question was taken, and decided in the
affirmative—yeas 158, nays 25; as follow:

[Mr. McDonald declined to vote, stating that !
he had paired off.]
So the amendment was agreed to.
Thequestion recurring on the amendment of Mr.
Toomds, as amended—
Mr. HARALSON inquired of the Speaker if,
after the vote was taken on the amendment as
amended, he would then have the privilege of voting
on the original resolution separately.
Tne SPEAKER. The question is on agreeing
to the amendment as amended. After that ques-
tion shall have #een disposed of, and the substitute
and amendment to the resolutions shall have been
disposed of, if the House should not adopt the
substitute, the question will iefiur on agreeing to
the original resolution as amended, and the gentle-
man from Georgia, [Mr. Haralson,] by calling
for a division, can have the question taken sepa-
rately.
Mr. HARALSON. Suppose the substitute is
adopted ?
The SPEAKER. It is not a substitute, it is
only an additional resolution.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas, moved that the
House adjourn.
The House refused to adjourn.
Mr. JONES, (to the Speaker.) Do I under-
stand the Speaker to say, that when we come to
vote upon the adoption of the resolutions, should
the substitute be rejected, it will be in order to
take a vote on the resolutions separately ?
The SPEAKER assented.
Mr. -JONES. Will'it, in the opinion of the
Chair, be in order to take a vote separately on the i
resolution of the gentleman from Georgia, and ;
then on the proviso ? j
The SPEAKER. In the opinion of the Chair, \
it will not be in order, because it would be merely |
striking out what had been already inserted by the ;
House: . S
The question (continued the Speaker) is on j
agreeing to the amendment as amended. !

So the House refused to lay the whole subject
on the table.
Mr. WXLLtAMSjL moved that the House ad-
journ.
Tellers were ordered, and Messrs. Fowler, of "
Massachusetts, and Savage, of Tennessee, were
appointed.
And the question was'taken and decided in the
negative—ayes 64, noes 89.
So the House refused to adjourn.
The SPEAKER stated the question to be on the
amendment of the gentleman from Mississippi
[Mr. Thompson] to the substitute of the gentleman
hom Ohio, [Mr. Schenck.]
Mr. MARSHALL called for a division on the
amendment.
The SPEAKER. A division is called for. The
question will then be on the first branch of the
amendment of the ^entieman from Mississippi.
Mr. RICHARDSON rose to a question of or-
der. He desired t > know whether an amendment
to an amendment could b3 divided ?
The SPEAKER, overruled the point of order.
Mr. DISNEY inquired of tne Speaker, whether
the substitute of tile gentleman from Onto [Mr.
Schenck] was not identical with the amendment
as amended, which had just been voted do*vn ?
The SPEAKER. Tne Chair has not examined
the two piopositions closely, and cannot, there-
] fore, say whether they are identical or not.
I Mr. DISNEY. As the propositions fed upon
j my ear in the reading, the two are identical.
! The SPEAKER. Probably they are so. The
j Chair did not notice them very particularly, and
i cannot perceiye how a point of order is to be
| made.
| After a brief conversation between Mr. Preston
| Kikg and the Chair, (of which little was heard by
j the reporter)—
Asr. RICHARDSON inquired whether he was
! to understand the Speaker as having decided that
1 an amendment to «n amendment could be divided?
The SPEAKER assented.
Mr. RICHARDSON appealed from the decis-
: ion.
' . The SPEAKER stated the question. The gen-
| tleman from Ohio had offered an,amendment; the
I gentleman from Mississippi had moved an amend-
j ment to the amendment; the proposition of the gen-
; tleman from Mississippi contained two substan-
1 ttves, distinct propositions. A division of the ques-
tion ha'd been called forupon^the amendment to the
amendment; the Chair has ruled that it is divisible;
(rum this decision the gentleman from Illinois has
taken an appearand the question is, "Shall the
decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the
House ?"
The question was taken, and decided in the af-
firmative.
So* the decision was sustained, and the question
decided to be divisible.
The question then being upon agreeing to the
first part of the amendment of Mr. Thompson, of
Mississippi—
Mr. BURT desired to know if the proposition
moved by the gentleman from Ohio as a substitute,
was not identical with the proposition voted down
as an amendment a short time sincc ?
The SPEAKER. It is the same proposition.
Mr. BURT. Then i make the point of order,
that whether the gentleman moves it as an amend-
ment or a substitute, it is still an amendment, and
the House cannot be required to vote upon the
same amendment time after tune.
The SPEAKER stated, that if the point of order
were good of itself, it was too late to entertain it;
that, to have been received, it ought to have been
made when one or the other of the propositions
had been offered.
But the Chair will state to the gentleman from
South Carolina, and to the House, that the House
mi^ht, for reasons satisfactory to themselvfs, be
willing to adopt this as a substitute for all the res-
olutions, and yet he unwilling to add it to the
other resolutions reported by the committee. The
Chair must, therefore, have held the point of order
not to he good, if it had been made at the pioper
time.
The question was on agreeing to the first part
of the amendment of the gentleman from Missis-
sippi, [Mr. Thompson,] in the following woids:
'-'And con?«qu«ntty th:u thy H >usc al-o totally di*sent3

dent of the United Stat' to the Secretaiy or War, 'that
