aga will be repaired in about four hours. Everything is quiet, and no indications of the enemy in any force this side of Elk River. I have a small force of cavalry at Athens, which will be withdrawn to-night, and roads picketed with cavalry toward Elkton, and scouts sent out from here to advise us of any movements of the enemy.

Pulaski was abandoned day before yesterday, and our forces withdrawn to Columbia. There was skirmishing in the vicinity of that place yesterday and to-day. The wires are down between here and there now. It is supposed Hood's entire force is moving toward Middle Tennessee.

Major-General THOMAS:

The Eleventh Indiana Cavalry is here. My force is too small to establish a courier-line to Columbia. Would it not do to order a detachment of said regiment to do that duty?
