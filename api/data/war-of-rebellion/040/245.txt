that you will inform him, without delay, of the probably hour you will be able to resume your march. In marching you must require your men to keep together as much as in an Indian country. Send any officer to the rear who does not keep his command in head. You will lose every man and horse separates from his command.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, U. S. MILITARY RAILROADS

Washington, D. C., April 23, 1863.

The superintendents of military railroads in Virginia are instructed to forward trains with supplies to any point to which they may be ordered; but in cases where, from absence of insufficiency of military protection, trains are in danger of capture, the orders must come from the general in command of the department, and not from any subordinate officer.

H. HAUPT,

Brigadier General, in charge Const. and Trans., U. S. M. R. R.

CAMP AT WARRENTON JUNCTION,

April 23, 1863-12 m.

General S. WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The command is now separated by impassable streams, and I am unable to communicate with the different portions of it, owing to the small streams being swimming. The pickets are cut off by high water.

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General, Commanding Cavalry.

FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, April 23, 1863.

(Received April 23-10.50 p. m.)

Lieutenant-Colonel LATHROP, Assistant Inspector-General:

As General Stoneman is at Warrenton Junction with a strong force of cavalry, I would respectfully request permission to withdraw my regiment of cavalry from Bristoe, where it is now patrolling from there to Bull Run, as my forces are too small to have so many detachments, besides the long line our cavalry has to cover, and as I need force in case of any emergency.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.
