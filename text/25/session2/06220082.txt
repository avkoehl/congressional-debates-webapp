Making pvblic officers depositaries—Mr. TFrigh1
Senate.
of bank notes to the amount ot about twenty
millions ot dollars over and above those in circula-
tion, issued, to a certain extent, on the faith of the
United States and bearing a corresponding credit
There appears at least in many portions of the
country, a strong deposition on the pan of the
banks to resume specie payments, but the uncon-
trolled possession of this vast amount of paper
money will enable the present Bank of the United
States, if so disposed, to retard, peihaps to prevent,
them from effecting that laudable and desirable
object It holds in its hand, under the apparent
sanction of Congress, an immense fund, which it
cnn transport to any part of the country at its
pleasure, and puichase the notes of the State banks,
to be letumed upon them en masse, at the very
mstaut the> shall endeavor to resume. What is
there to prevent this institution from sending to
New Orleans one or two millions of these notes,
placing them in the possession of any local bank
01 its agents, and exchanging them for the notes,
ot banks preparing to lesume, so that they may
be u-ed to embarrass and retaid their effort* as
soon as they aie commenced? It cannot be said
that this ,s i pioceedmg arising from the laige
capital of the present Bank of the United States,
ana which is not consequent upon the issue ot
its old "ml uncancelled notes. It is the possession
of these notes which exempts it from danger in the
adoption oí such a course Independent ol the
additional credit attached to them from being made
under a na mini chanei, they die now circulated
v uhout the responsibility that attends those issued
under the chartet ot the State, and it is to this
cause that may be attubuted the remaikable fact,
disclosed in the statement of the bank on the 5th
January last, that «hilcihey had on hand fifteen
millions eight hundred thousand five hundred and
seventeen dollars and seventy-thiee cents oí the old
notes, one million four hundred and three thou-
sand ninety-two dollars at their State bank agen-
cies, and two millions seven hundred and thirty-
three thousand nine hundred and ninety dollars in
transitu, making altogether no less a sum in their
actual possession and under their control thin nine-
teen millions, nine hundred and thiuy-seven thou-
sand five hundred and ninety-nine dolíais and
seventy-three cents of these old notes, when the)
had, also, m ououlation among the commumlj,
the further sum of six millions two hundied and
twenty thou andfoui bundled and s vty-seven dol-
lars and seventeen cents of these same old notes,
htm i an aggr-gate oí the notes of the expired cor-
poration, ot twenty-six millions one hundred ami
fifty eght thousand and sixty-six dolíais and
ninety cents, yet, at the same time, the whole out-
standing circulation ot their own notes, (exclusive
of post notes,) only amounted to five hundred and
forty-seven thousand six bundled dollars and
forty five cents, or about the fortieth part of thf old
notes in their hand? and in circulation
On eveiy note issued under the presort Slate
chaiter of Pennsylvania, the holder jias by the State
law a summary proceeding, if it is not redeemed
on demard, more than this, the bank is bound, in
case oí refusal, to pay the high mtciest oí 12 per
cent , and if such leiusal be continued beyond a
stated period, there is a provision for the speedy
forfeiture of its charter
But how is it with these notes of the late bank,
of which it has obtained possession' To them none
of these penalties of the law of Pennsylvania will
apply, u has received them, and promises to redeem
them as a mere trustee, and, in case of refusal, the
holder, it is presumed, is to be driven to the tedious
process of a suit m chanceiy, or some other form
ofprotiac'ed legal proceeding, to obtain that pay-
ment which he could enforce if the note had been
issued by a State bank, in the most rapid and com-
pulsory mode Thus it is, that so long as Con-
gress peimits this institution to keep and issue
these notes, it gives it the power ot circulating a
paper currency, free from the restrictions and sa<e-
guaids -vhich the State that chaitered it meant to
impose, u enables it to control the efforts of other
banks for tne resumption of specie pay ments, and
eaves the citizen who takes or circulates these
notes without any speedy protection and redress.
*  ' agam This voluntary trustee of the Na-
tional Bank received its new ch irter from the
¡átite of Pennsylvania, on theexpiessed condit on
that i' should is\ne no bank note of a less denomi-
nation than ten dollar*. It is presumed to be pait
of the policy of that wise State, that the circula-
tion ol so large an institution should be so limited.
The neglect of Congiess has defeated this <n-
lutary pohcy, it has given to the trustee the
means and power of doing that which the Slate
of Pennsylvania intended should not be done, fue
dollar notes are largely issued by the Bank ol the
United States chattered by Pennsylvania, though
the Legislature of that State, declared they* should
not be Congress cannot be justified in permuting
this It is due to the State of Pennsylvania that
they should respect her laws, that they should not,
by any omission on then part, permit a power
del i ved from them to be so exercised as to thwait
hei designs Wnde it is the solemn and evident
duty of Congress not to interfile with the institu-
tions of the States, but to leave them to pursu. the
pol c) of the Legislatures by which they wtre i ie-
ated, and t > answer to those authoiilies ibi eveiy

SPEECH OF \1R   WRIGHT,
(>*  Nfw York,
hi'Senate, Jsiiweiiy 31, 1838—Upen the bill " to im-
pe>se additional duties, as depositaries, upon cer-
tain public officers, to appoint ReceiversGe-neral
of public money, and to regulate the safe-keep-
mg,  Uansftr, and disbursement, of the  public
money s of the United States "
Mr  WRIGHT said he regretted that it would
be neccssaiy for him to impose a more severe tax
upon the time and patience of the Senate, than he
had evei befoie been compelled to impose, since ho
had been honored w,th a seat in the body   He had
In ped, theieiore, that he should have been able io
reach the subfct atan eailiei houi in the morning,
but, as it was, he would endeavor to conclude with
th   sitti íg oí the day
He said he e ii ired n| on the debate vvjth a pain-
ful consciousness of h s inability to do justice to the
positiem he held m lefetence to the measure upon
the table The discussion oí it must involve ques-
tions ol the highest importance in politics, of the
most pervading interest in finance, and, as he
thought, of equal magnitude in the morals of Go-
vernment These questions were to be discussed,
<1(liberated upon, and decided by the Senate, and
upon him had fallen the duty of opening such a de-
bate beloie that high tribunal
Could he call to his aid talents, experience,
hammer, powei of argument, and perspiauity of
I ii'ms", siuli t- were possessed and at the corn-
il in 1 11 mam ol the distinguished Senatois whom
he knctt bt must tmot in opposition io the bill, he
should Ie 1 a gritil/inB confidence that he could
' uiituid succe ssiully, <,i id could triumphantly refute
ewiy objection Ac it was, he was consoled by
the iciUc-tum that he sh uld be followed in the de-
lu i by other Senators equally able and equally
di unguishctl, an i who would only have occasion
lo i k of him that he should not injure a cause
which must i,u its defence with them He would
mem cheeifully promise them that he would not
intentionally throw obstacles in their way, and he
would entreat the Senate to judge of the bill from
its piovisions, winch ho consideiedsound and salu-
taiy, and not ftom the weaknesses they would not
fail to it scover in his attempt to support them
Justice to himself lequired another preliminary
tetn uk But a few months had passed since they
wen engaged there in the ehscussnon ot this same
measure, oi rather, perhaps he should say, of a
in. asm e precisely similar m its great leading fea-
lu-es In that discussion he had taken a part, and
if he should be found upon ih s occasion repeating
"It a , an! urging arguments, which he had then ad-
vanced, the reason and his apology must be sought
m the identity of the subjects, and not in a deposi-
tion on his part to trmble the Senate now with íe-
marks to wh ch they had once done him the honor
to listen
Tie said the bill was based upon two great lead-
ing principles, and that all its provisions, detailed
and numeious as they were, became necessary, m
the judgment oí the committee, to carry those pun-
ciptes successfully into prac tice     These pnnciples
