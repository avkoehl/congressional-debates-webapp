glad to change them for other troops. I had some of the militia, and I found them much better suited for the service and much more reliable. Will it be possible to relieve me of the brigadier-General?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

[First indorsement.]

NOVEMBER 7, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War:

I concur in the views of General Winder, as given within, and ask authority to order as requested.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

[Second indorsement.]

NOVEMBER 10, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

General Gartrell cannot be relived from command of his brigade. This complaint had better be communicated to General Cobb, and he asked to consider and removed it.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.

[Third indorsement.]

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

November 16, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Major-General Cobb.

His attention is invited to the preceding indorsement.

By command of the Secretary of War:

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, December 23, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Unless Wheeler's command of twelve so-called brigades can be properly organized into division, under good commanders, a large portion of it had better be dismounted forthwith; its conduct in front on the enemy, and its depredations on private property; render it worse than unless. I regret being unable to recommend for promotion any of General Wheeler's brigadiers, but hope that if two or three capable major-General cannot be had, promotions might be made for the purpose indicated from General Hampton's cavalry. Brigadier-General Dearing, of that command, attacked my attention last summer as a promising officer; I would be glad to have him.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
