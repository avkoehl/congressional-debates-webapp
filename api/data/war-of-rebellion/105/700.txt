until you can hear from me. I have sent 10,000 rounds of ammunition to you at San Diego by the Senator last night. Have it got at once. I have written to have stoves sent to you. I will soon send you some cavalry, say a lieutenant, a sergeant, a corporal, and twenty-five men, starting to-morrow or next day. Try and have shelter for the horses. The horses must be kept in fine condition if you have the hard service you anticipate for cavalry. Mr. Showalter and men of that stripe must be searched for expected evidences of treason, and at all events they must take the oath of allegiance besides. If they refuse, hold them securely and report all the facts in the case, as I have before written. We have had enough of the bullying and treason of such men. If Judge Terry tries to pass, he must go through the same ordeal. There must be no child's play with him. Keep your own counsel; act with great circumspection, but with firmness. Put yourself in en rapport with the Indians. They will give you much valuable information of little parties attempting to dodge by you. I have sent you a forge, muleshoes, nails, tols, and some clothing. You can now put everything in service order and keep it so. Be ready at a moment's notice to move on to the help of West. Your position is such at this ciritcal juncture that you must keep up a sleepless vigilance. Have your command in fighting order all the time, night or day. Keep me advised of all you do. Much is expected of you and all your command, officers and men. Drill, drill, drill, until your men become perfect as soldiers, as skirmishers, as marksmen. Keep the command in good health. Look after the messing every day yourself, and be sure the police and cleanliness of camp is perfect.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First California Volunteers, Commanding.

LOS ANGELES, CAL., November 4, 1861.

MY DEAR EYRE: I received your kind note of the 30th of October this morning. In case you find by a shrewd and careful set of traps, which you have the address to set, that the person alluded to in the copy of a letter sent by Lieutenant Cutler is playing false tot he Government (Doctor B---) - in case you obtain good evidence to this end (and if it exist you will obtain it, I am sure), then seize him quietly, search him and his premises throughouly for all peprs going to prove his disloyalty and hold him securely until you hear from me. Obey no writ of habeas corpus in his case after you have one seized him, as you will have in your possession evidences of his guilt strong enough to justify his detention. I will uphold you in resisting the writ until you hear from me. There must be no child's play in what we do in so flagrant a case as his will be, holding the position he does. It is said the mail-carrier and post-office people in your place are to be doubted. Is this so? If so, then all important communications to me must be sent in by an officer by stage, as you have no horses. Lieutenant-Colonel Davis has resigned. His resignation has been accepted by the Governor, and Davis has gone home on the Golden Gate. Keep every string drawing; practice skirmish drill, and (judiciously as regards ammunition) target practice. We may have use for your men at any day. It is not certain that an attempt will not be made to come across the desert. See Alta; see inclosed letter (Warner's). * Kee all these matters in your own bosom.
