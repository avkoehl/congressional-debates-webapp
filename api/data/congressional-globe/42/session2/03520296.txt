eight per cent.
At the census of 1870 the products of the mines and fisheries are not included with the manufactures,
as heretofore. In 1860 the products of the mines and fisheries amounted to about ninety million dollars.
Mr. John L. Hayes, in an address to the
■wool-growers and manufacturers in conven-
tion at Syracuse, furnishes these statistics of
wool:
"In 1850 our total wool production, according to
the returns of the census, was 52,516,359 pounds. In
i860, under a free-trade policy, it had reached only
60,5ll,343 pounds. The estimates of a Government
statistician place the product of 1865 at 115,000,000
pounds, an average ot 85,000,000 pounds per annum
for the first five years of the decade, and for the last
five years of the decade at an average of 130,000,000
pounds per annum. A private statistician in the
trade, of accepted reliability, estimates the total
wool production of the United States for 1867 at
160,000,000 pounds; for 1868,at 177,000,000 pounds; for
1869, at 162,250,000 pounds; and for 1870, at 163.000,000
pounds."
In coal, British growth in ten years was sixty
percent.; American growth, fifty per cent. In
pigiron, British growth was fifty-five per cent.;
American growth, one hundred percent. In
cotton manufactures, British growth was about
forty per cent.; American growth, about the
same. In woolen manufactures, British growth
was fifty-six per cent.; American growth, was
over one hundred and sixty per cent. In wool
our increase has been threefold since 1860,
and in steel our increase has been more than
fivefold since 1865. In the grand cycle of all
manufactures our production has more than
doubled in ten years. These are the results of
the work of those whom the gentleman from
Illinois [Mr. Borchard] sneers at aa "pen-
sioners upon the bounty of the Government."
He is not the first lawyer and not the first
theorist who has thus stigmatized the pro-
ducers of this country. The national invent-
ory, the growing wealth of the Republic, show
the independence, the creative energy, the crys-
tallized achievements of these "pensioners."
Observe particularly that the growth of
woolen manufacture is in the South and West.
Thus facts rebuke the attempt of my col-
league on the committee to excite sectional
prejudice. I regretted very much to hear his
language, and was surprised at his attitude.
Compare, too, how general manufactures
march with steady tread southward and west-
ward. Gentlemen will do well to consider how
many of those whom they so flippantly brand
as "pensioners" are the architects of all our
growth and progress.
This grand total of the manufactures of the
United States, more than $4,302,000,000, pro-
tests against disturbance by inconsiderate legis-
lation. The increase in the true valuation of
the real and personal property of the nation
from $16,159,616,068 in 1860 to the magnifi-
cent total of $30,068,518,507 in 1870, forbids
rash and presumptuous charges.
THE BRITISH FACT.
The earnings of capital have reached their
minimum in Britain. Wealth overflows; mere
commerce spreads; production has approx-
imated its maximum. British authors portray
the dangers of the situation. Mill may expose
the evils of overpopulation, Euskin draw
scathing pictures of poverty, Dickens and
Reade and George Eliot lift the curtain from
before toiling millions. Other writers—Sul-
livan, Grant, Hoyle, Byles—less known to
fashionable readers, probe even deeper. To
them belongs the work of warning and of
reform for Britain. I predict ro coming
storm, and fix attention on no muttering
thunder. With all its parade, the commerce
of Britain is hollow and unstable; its manu-
factures, grand as they are, no longer grow in
the old fashion; its agriculture is a secondary
and decreasing element in its wealth.
THE AMERICAS IDEAL,
My ideal for my country is far other. Com-
merce I will welcome when it is handmaid and
not mistress ; but America need follow in the
wake of no leader. Our mines, our fields,
our forests, incite us to grand success. All
the metals, cotton, wool, sugar, tobacco—
all the cereals, provide the means of a produc-
tive industry such as time has not elsewhere
illustrated; work for all and every man at
work! Ore sparkling in the fires of skilled
mechanism, fabrics for every human use,
wares forevery market, ought to be multiplied
to answer every demand at home, and enlarged
production will command the trade of the
globe. We must develop and utilize our great
resources. We can afford to leave to Britain
the device of attempting to reduce the prices
of wares in all the markets of the world. Out
mission is to raise the wages of labor and the
condition of humanity. For this the grand
gifts of nature have been ^bestowed on us, and
we must not dare be false to the solemn trust.
DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRY AND ITS KETDKSS.
The census proves that in some good meas-
ure we have developed the resources which
a bounteous Providence has bestowed upon us.
Such results indicate the thrift, the energy,
tbe success of our people generally. They are
the monuments of the ability and achieve-
ments of our producing classes. Advocates
of radical changes in our financial policy find,
however, that all is not perfect in our condition.
The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Pxxk-
elnburg] the other day drew to the light the
short-comings of Massachusetts. Every human
situation is open to criticism, and one step to-
ward improvement is to show the need of it.
My friend asserts that some men are poorly
paid in Massachusetts. Would it better their
condition to destroy the industry in which they
are engaged? Would it improve the situation
of other working people to throw the opera-
tives in New England factories out of employ-
ment? Quite the reverse. The gentleman
eloquently states that agricultural labor is well
remunerated in the valley of the Mississippi.
Why? Because a home market exists for
nearly all tbe product of our soil. Because
in so many mechanical pursuits are employed
consumers, who, but for those pursuits, would
be themselyes engaged in agriculture, and
therefore not purchasers.
See the general advantage here. No mat-
ter what the greater relative superiority may
be in agriculture, we ought not, as a people,
to prosecute that occupation solely. In farm-
ing only a part of the year is fully and profit-
ably occupied ; a considerable number of per-
sons in a purely agricultural district cannot
be remuneratively occupied at all. What-
ever may be our superior facilities in agricul-
ture, in order to utilize all of our labor we
must introduce other vocations. Add to agri-
culture a single handicraft, as shoemaking;
you will provide work for a part of those who
were not fully occupied before. As you add
to the varieties of employments, you reduce
the number of those who are idle by com-
pulsion ; you give scope to variety of taste;
you render profitable differences of strength,
of skill in manipulation, of taste and genius;
