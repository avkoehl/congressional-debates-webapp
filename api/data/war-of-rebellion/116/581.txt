Question. Did the shooting occur while you were on duty?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. Did you witness the transaction?

Answer. I did.

Question. Relate what you saw and heard.

Answer. Between the hours of 6 and 8 o'clock yesterday morning sentinel Numbers 30 and myself, being about five yards apart, were standing with our backs toward the prisoners. On turning around I saw a man in the act of committing a nuisance. I told him that we had strict orders not to permit that, that he must go to a sink. I heard sentinel Numbers 30 order him (the prisoner) away a number of times, but he still persisted in the act. Sentinel Numbers 30 threw a stone at the prisoner.

Question. After the stone was thrown did the prisoner leave?

Answer. No, sir; he sat there for about two minutes longer.

Question. What then happened?

Answer. Six or seven prisoners rushed to the scene, one in advance of the rest with a stick or bone in his hand. He talked angrily, but I could not understand all that he said. I told sentinel Numbers 30 if the prisoner made an attempt to force his beat to shoot him. I thought they meant to assault the sentinel. I heard the prisoner call the sentinel a damned son of a bitch. The prisoners kept advancing when sentinel Numbers 30 fired and the man with something in his hand fell.

Question. Were sentinel and prisoners facing each other?

Answr. Nearly so; the prisoner came up obliquely.
