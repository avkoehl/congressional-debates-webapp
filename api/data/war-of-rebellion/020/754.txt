and ordered, in case of attack, to co-operate with the military stationed in their vicinity. I think their numbers are sufficient for self-defense if they were properly supplied with means.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. FISHER,

First Lieutenant, Commanding Salt-makers.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS DEPT. OF S. C. GA., AND FLA., Charleston, S. C., January 18, 1863.

As a check on exaggerated reports concerning the enemy's forces which may soon be in your district, and to guide you and your officers when questioning spies, deserters, and others touching the enemy, a table is appended, showing the organization habitually in use in the Federal Army. Their brigades consist of four regiments, of 625 men, 2,500; divisions consist of three brigades, 7,500; army corps or wings not to exceed four divisions, or 30,000; cavalry, one brigade of four regiments, or 2,500; artillery in the proportion of three pieces would be 5 major-generals and 12 brigadiers, or 17 general officers; but brigadiers generally command divisions and colonels brigades in their service.

Should any officer of your command improperly or unduly exaggerate the force of the enemy in your front he should either be arrested or made to verify his information by a close personal reconnaissance of the enemy. Exaggerated rumors are apt to demoralize new troops, who incline to regard numbers as an indication of strength and of ultimate success, being ignorant of the decisive weight of discipline, mobility, and celerity of movement in military operations.

By command of General Beauregard:

THOMAS JORDAN, Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, S. C., January 23, 1863.
