APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
26th Covo.......1st Sess.
Cumberland Road-—Mr. Clay of Jila,
the survey and improvement of po ts, ri.'er«, an I
harbors, amounted to§121,094, in 1838, .tre-to^d
the very formidab'e amount ot #1 183,S76 And
you need only refer to the yeas and nay* to aler-
tan  which ot the nvo parties on this floor have
been most favorable to appropriations oí this dé-
se íption. Have they ever encountered opposition
here' It has been ehioflv from the friends of the
Administration My friend and co'league, the
former distinguished chairman of the Commiit-e
of Ways and Means, [Mr Cambreieng,] gene-
rally voted against appropriations for obje^i  of
(his description; and to «how that the policy of ex-
pending ihe public tieasure in the improvement of
harbor*, rivets, and ports, is a lavorue policy wi h
the Opposition, he needed only refer to demonstra-
tions vfery recently made bv two of h's Whig col-
leagues, [Messis Barvird and Marvin ] Both
hid proposed b lis for these purposes, and both had
made long speeches in favor ot annua y «-ettmg
apart large apptopnat oís f r objfo's ot this
description. Let me not, tnen, b" told that
the enormous ncrease und°r th s single lead,
from §121,094, to near'y two millions of
dollars, is the fruit of th-- policy of ih'«¡ or the past
Administration. Thc-e appiopna'ions have ever
found favor with Ftderal high-bank, high-tanM
Whigs. Though I plead gin ty to the charge o(
having voted for many of them, I am «wry to be
constrained to admit c con'end that (hey finí their
justification (if justified they can be) in the prin-
ciples of latuudinarian Whigery. Thev are the
favorite appropmt oris of th " Whigs, and if is a
little unkind, when ih-y rebuke us for the increase
of expenditures within the las  twel/e years, that
they should iemember to forget thit rrost of this
increase is attributable lo objects, for which ihey
not en'y voted, but wh'ch may be retried as the
offspring of their own principles and affect ons
Had not General Jackson vetoed the Maysville
road bill, and had nU the De nocracy sustain-d him
in this great step, could you unlertike to tell me of
the mad prodigality and reckless expenditures you
■would now have beheld and deploren Sir, it was
this veto that closed the largest, the most alarm-
ing outlet to the pub ic Treavury, a measuie no
less salutary than bold, for*which re received
from the new-fangled Whigs of the day, nought
but the most unmeasured derision and vi uperation,
A word as to your naval establishment, and I
shall have finished my comparison of expenditures
In 1828, the expenditure fir buiHine vest's of
war was $226,387 In 1838 it was <fjl,490 978
Will    you   taunt   the   Administration   for   this
ncrease? The party in power has generally
leen suspected of not he ng quife fr,endly enough
to th s arm of our national defence. Federalists
often claim it as their pel; as the ch Id of their own
peculiar nur-mg. Mr JerTer on was rtdict led for
his predilection for gunboats, as opposed to a navy.
You claim the merit, sir, of having early lak n V is
interest to your bosom     It has b en well, however,
ul not too well, guarded by the pnst and pn sent
Administrations, and is it ju f now, that you ¡.hould
make the fostering care which we have extended to
it a subject of reproach1! About as just, sir, as are
a'l the reproaches you are heaping upon us for the
increase of the expenditures of the Government,
exrenditur-s for wh ch you, as a party, have uni-
formly vo'ed, and for opposing which you woulJ
have rebuked us, as must faithless to the pub'ic in-
terest If the expenditures have been increas~d
since 1828, you are in >re tnan pariiceps crxmmis
Though the augmenta iin in the expenditures
has, within ihe la^t f íuitecn years, b°en c nMde-
rable, by means of'egislation, f«r which, as I have
shown, the Opposition are at least eqia'lj responsi-
ble with the fnen Is of the Administration, vet has

ods of our history, ner has it k pt pace with the
pngress of population and wea th In the annual
repott of the S cretary of ihe Tteasury, you will
find a very full and lucid exposi ion of the m-reas"
of expenditure as compared with the iticm-e of

attention of trie committee to on^ or two paragraphs

Thu~, sir, y >u peneive that, great as has le°n
ihe increase of expenses by means of the legisla-
tion of Congress, it has not yet been equal to the
increase of wealth and population. Then is an-
other cause which, in seme measuie, no doubt,
contributed to this increase of our expers~s, which,
I trust, w \[ nül very soon occur again. I reler 'o
the unwieldy surplus which flowed from the spirit
of ^pcuilaiion produced bv the expansion o! ihe
Bank of the United State-, in 1834, an 1 ihe pur-
^u t o I ihe same p hey by ihe S'ate banks Iiapo -
tauoijs of foreign goods swelled from one hundred
and < ne milium  of dollars in 1833, to one hun-
dred and ninety millions in 1836, and the sales of
your public lands at once swellel from three er
four millions per year to twenty fiur millions, m
the bloated year ot 1836 The djties upon this
unprec^den'ed y heavy importation, and the pro-
ceed  of this immense sale ot publ c lands, brought
into your Treasury more th-in ti rty millions of
dollars beyond trie ordinary wanis of the Oovern-
ment. Thr scheme of distribution among the
States was at once conceived by a paity in
Corgress; though thete was anotnei pa'ty
here who consc eniiously believed that this would
be the most mi^c nevous and alarming depo-
sition that could be mide of the surplus;
and not a tew thousht that it wou'd be better, far
belter, that it were sunk in the bottom of the ocean;
that it would be an example that would impair ihe
inde,endence of the Sta'e , create a reliance, on
their part, up in this g'eat Federal heal; and serve
to make this Government the col'et tor of laxes for,
and the dis ributor ot, largesses to the members ot
this Confederacy Many genilemen were thus in-
duced, no doubt, o favor appropi ations that would
not have received their sane ioa had not this
scheme of distribution been on lo it. They voted
for objects, that would not otherwise have com-
manded their support, because they looked upon
such dispositions of the public treasure as a lesser
evil than the alternative of distributnn Sir, 1 had
the honor of recording my vote against the depo-
site or distribution bill, and I look I ack upon it
with more pride and satisfact on than on any other
vete of my life A distinguí hed Senator from
Missouri proposed to app'y a cons derable poit on
of this surplus to the purpose of erect ng an ade-
quate li'ie of fortifications along our seaboard, and
well wou d it have been if this judicious and con-
stuu lonal disposiuon had been made. Then, sir,
woald the nation have no cause to tremble with
alarm for our large cities at the slightest pros-
pect of a conflict with a foreign power Then
voult ve have secured a guarantee for a long
peace, by exhibiting an adeqiate p eparttitn

Alabama to strike out ihe two per c nt clause,
Mr CLAY ' Kentucky addressed the Senate at
leng.h in favoi of the amen Iment, and the question
being taken ihereon, a was rejected—ayes 17, nays
19, as" follows
YEAS—Mes rs Calloun, Cla\ of Alabama,

Brown, Cuthbert, Fulton, Gran ly, Linn, Nicholas
Pierce, Robinson, Smith of Indiana, Sturgeon,
fdllmadge, Tappan, Wall, Whie, Wright, and
Youi g —19.
Mr CL-\Y of Alabama then propose], as an
amendment, to striKe out all a'ter the eincting
clause ot the bul, and insert ihe following as a sub-
stitute
"That the two per cent, of th1 n°it proceeds tt
t ie sales ot public lands in the several States ot
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Mis ouri, which may
accn e after the passage ot this act, and which wai
reserved by the several acts tor the admi-sion ot
said several Sta'es into the Union, to be applied to
the laying out and construction of roads leaiing to
the said States respectively, be, and ihe same ii
hereby, relinquished lo said State respectively, to
be paid over to ¡-uch pers n or persons as may be
autnori7ed to receive ihe same, to be applied by said
Sutes re pectivtly, to such roads or canals wihm
thtir several limits, as ihsy think proper Provuitd
the Legislatures of each nt said Sta es shall, before
receiving any part of the «aid fund, pa«s an act, ir-
revocable withe ut th  consent of Congress, assent-
ing to the previsions of this act "
Mr. C said as it seemed,from the vote just taken,
that we were to go on appropriating money for
this road, on the pretext that the Gemral Govern-
ment w¿s to be refunded out of the two per cent,
ar sing from t ¡e sales ot the public lands, in the
Siates t) and through vih ch it was to run, notwith-
standing that fund, present and pro«p ctive, had
been exhau ted more than three t mes tald, he
now proposed to put an end lo ih => enormous ar-
nual drain from the Treasury, bv giving up all
that was hereafter to accrue He said sure'y,
when it had been shown that the whole amount of
ihe two per cm! fun 1 of he foui Slates, (O i o In-
diana, Illinois, and Mi soun,) which had now
accrued, was bnt $1,096,012 18, and that we had
appropriated and expended $6,609,487 70—ei-
ceeding thp aimunt ihey had any rght to claim,
ihesjmot $5,513,395 58—they won 11 consent to
take all the fund which was hereafter to accrue,
and release us from any further expenditure. Mr
C said this must be regarced em all ha'dsasa
liberal propose on. The friends cf the road
claimed ihe appn prution, on the greundthatit
was either now, or would become, piyable under
the compic s with those S.a es reserving the fund,
andho.vc nil they reject ihis proposition, when
ro one dctiie I ihat we had gone far beyond fie
amount wh,ch had acciuied in pist expend.teff.
