LOOKOUT, November 22, [1863.]

General HARDEE:

No report from scout sent to Trenton. Cavalry ordered there last night. The enemy burned some houses in the night, and I think left at same time. Will report as soon as I ascertain definitely. Signal line has been removed from west side and communication is by courier only. It should be re-established.

C. L. STEVENSON,

Major-General.

I will attend to it.

NOVEMBER 22, 1863.

Major REEVE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have been unable to ascertain certainly whether there is any enemy at Trenton. I believe there is none. I have 2 scouts out now for that purpose. They will report to Colonel Butler on their return to Powell's Pass. Two other scouts were sent in that direction last night, who have not returned. I directed Colonel Butler to use the scouts on their return until further orders.

Respectfully, major, your obedient servant,

J. C. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Powell's Pass, November 22, 1863-2.15 p. m.

Major J. J. REEVE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Colonel Butler has returned and reports no enemy on the mountain. Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson occupies Johnson's Crook and had sent a scout toward Trenton.

I have ordered Major McConnell to take up his old position at Trenton and withdraw his picket from the Johnson Crook road. Not hearing again from you, I have ordered Captain Kuhn to move to position occupied by McConnell's picket on this road (10 miles distant), report to you from time to time, and to establish two courier stations for that purpose. He has neither rations nor forage. My brigade is in motion to its old camp, leaving Butler on picket, as before. I have ordered Colonel Butler to construct defenses at each pass of logs, &amp;c.

I am, major, yours, &c.,

J. C. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
