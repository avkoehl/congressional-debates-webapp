APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
15
31st Cong 2d Sess.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
the application of electro-magnetism as a motive
power in mechanics have been continued since my
report made in compliance with a resolution of
the Senate in September last, by virtue of the ap-
propriation of March 3, 1849, and he is now en-
gaged in preparation for a trial trip of a locomo-
tive on a railroad propelled by this power.
The meteorological observations of Professor
Espy, which are still jn progress under the ap-
propriation made at the last session of Con-
gress, will be detailed in his report to be presented
to Congress.
The course of experiments in gunnery, and the
preparation of ordnance and ordnance stores of
all kinds at the navy-yard in Washington, have
been conducted in a manner highly satisfactory to
the Department; and in consideration of the great
importance of this particular duty to the effective-
ness of our naval armament everywhere, and the
labor and responsibility of the officer charged with
it, I with deference recommend that his compen-
sation be made equal to that of a commander at
sea.
A board of naval officers has been convened,
agreeably to your instructions, for advice and in-
formation on the question of rank between officers
of the military and civil branches of the naval
service, and the relative rank of officers of the
army and navy when acting together, on which
the opinion of the President was requested by a
resolution of the House of Representatives at the
last session, and their report will be laid before
you as soon as received.
The joint board of officers of the army and navy,
who have been engaged in the examination of our
Pacific coast with reference to harbors, fortifica-
tions, light-houses, navy-yards, and docks, is ex-
pected to finish its work in the present month, and
return to the seat of Government. The selection
of a site for a navy-yard and dock on that coast
has been deferred until the reception of the report
of the board, and a personal conference with the
officers comprising it.
By virtue of the authority conferred on the head
of tliis Department in the act of Congress, approved
September 28, 1850, to purchase American water-
rotted hemp in open market, for the use of the
navy, provided the price shall not exceed that of
"the foreign article for the last five years," the
hemp agents at Louisville and St. Louis have been
instructed to make inquiries and receive proposals
as to the price of the article; but no sufficient in-
formation has yet been received to justify pur-
chases of the quantity required.
I subjoin the reports of the respective heads of
bureaus of this Department, and of the command-
ant of the Marine Corps, presenting estimates for
the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1852, to-
gether with an aggregate statement of the appro-
priations required for all objects under the super-
vision of this Department, the sum total of which
is $8,111,601
Prom this should be deducted the esti-
mates for extraordinary objects, as
follows, viz: Transportation of the
mail, improvement of navy-yards,
nautical almanac, &c.   2,210,980
I would contribute to a better understanding of the
I matters involved, perhaps to greater economy !
under each of these various heads, and would re-
lieve the navy from the charge of extravagant ex-
penditures.
The total amount drawn from the Treasury j
during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1850, as
shown by the statement of appropriations for the '
naval service, prepared b^ the Second Comptroller
of the Treasury, is $9,691,805 61
From which deduct repayments.... 1,799,913 67
And there is left the sum of. $7,891,891 94
as the expenditures on all objects under the con-
trol of this Department. Of this amount there
was expended for special objects the sum of
s$2,368,169 11, leaving as the true expenditures
for the support of the navy and marine corps the
sum of $5,523,722 83.
The unexpended balance in the Treasury of the
appropriations for the naval service, marine corps,
and special objects, under the control of this
Department, on the 30th of June, 1850, was
$3,839,253 84, all of which will be required to I
meet outstanding obligations due from the appro- j
priations made for that year. f
I commend to the attention of Congress the re- '
forms introduced in the supply of provisions by ;
the efficient chief of that bureau, and his sugges-
tions as to others which can only be affected by
legislation. Likewise to the statement made by
the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
that the number of effective medical officers in the
service is insufficient for its wants, and his recom- I
mendation that those unfitted for duty shall be !
retired and their places supplied by new appoint-
ments. I also concur in his recommendation that
the sum of $200,000, part of the JNavy Hospital j
Fund, be invested in stocks, as a protection against
loss and. to insure a regular income.
The augmentation of the marine corps, as pro-
: posed in the report of its chief, deserves likewise 1
i the early attention of Congress. By a revision of |
| the complement tables of ships-of-war it is be-
I lieved that the number of landsmen might be
! reduced, and that of the rank and file of the ma- !
! rines increased, so as to provide for the deficiency
I now existing in this corps, without detriment to
the service, or additional expense to the Govern-
ment. â€¢ 1
I am, with the highest respect, your obedient
servant, WILLIAM A. GRAHAM,
Secretary of the Navy.
To the President.
The increase of our mail service for the last
fiscal year over the year preceding, was about
9 4-10 per cent., and the increase in the total cost
was about 12 7-10 per cent.
The extent and cost of such service for the last
year, its division among the States and Territories,
and its comparison with that of the preceding
year, will more fully appear by the accompany-
ing Report of the First Assistant Postmaster Gen-
eral.
The number of postmasters appointed during
the year ending June 30, 1850, was 6,518. Of
that number, 2,600 were appointed to fill vacan-
cies occasioned'by resignations; 233 to fill vacan-
cies occasioned by the decease of the previous in-
cumbents; 262 on a change of the sites of the
offices for which they were appointed; 1,144 on
the removal of their predecessors, and 1,979 were
appointed on the establishment of new offices.
The whole number of post offices in the United
States at the end of that year, was 18,417. There
were 1,979 post offices established, and 309 discon-
tinued during the year.
The postmasters and other agents of the Depart-
ment have, with few exceptions, performed their
duties vith fidelity and promptness, and maintained
the credit of the Department for efficiency and
usefulness.
The failures of connection which have from time
to time occurred on some of the routes, have
caused much inconvenience and annoyance. It is
hoped, however, that the renewed requirement of
the returns of weekly and monthly registers of the
arrivals and departures, by the postmasters, at the
ends of each route, which are noyr regularly made
to the Department, and the efficient action of the
increased number of special agents, will render
these irregularities less frequent.
The gross revenue of the Department for the
year ending June 30,1850, was $5,552,971 48, de-
rived from the following sources:
From'letter postage, including foreign postage and
stamps sold, - - - -$4,575,663 86
From newspaper and pamphlet post-
. age, - 919,485 94
From fines, ----- 38 00
From miscellaneous items, - - 3,048 66
From receipts on account of dead
letters,  1,748 40
To show the amount proposed for the
support of the naval service, inclu-
ding the Marine Corps, for the year, $5,900,621
The above aggregate, it will be perceived, is less
by more than one million of dollars than were the
estimates for the present year. To it, however,
must be added the amount which may be required
for the floating dry-dock, basin, and railway on
the coast of the Pacific, of which an estimate will
be supplied as soon as a contract shall be made,
and the price of the whole work agreed upon.
I take the liberty to suggest that the appropria-
tions for the annual support of the navy should be
separated from those for fixed and permanent ob-
jects on shore, and more especially from those for
extraordinary objects under the supervision of the
Department, which, however important as subjects
of public interest, are not necessarily connected
with it. If, in analogy to the bills for the erection
of fortifications, and for the support of the Mili-
tary Academy, as related to the army, distinct bills
were prepared for navy-yards and docks, and tlje
Naval Academy, and for the mail steam service,
and ether objects of the class above mentioned, it
Report of the Postmaster General.

eign mail routes, of the aggregate length of 15,079
miles, and the annual price of the transporta-
tion thereon, payable by this Department, was

of the preceding year.
There should be added to the cost of transport-
ation, as above stated, the expense of mail mes-
sengers and local and route agents, (which expense
is chargeable to the transportation fund, and which
for the last fiscal year amounted to $107,042;
being an increase of $45,529 on the expenses of
the mail messengers, and local and route agents,
