beyond ten miles to-day. I think you can smash up McCausland easily if you can corner him. He will endeavor to escape by breaking up into small parties. Patrols from Hedgesville report no enemy there. Rebels thought to be falling back.

Brigadier-General.

HANCOCK, MD., August 1, 1864--11 p. m.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY, Cumberland, Md.:

McCausland's men are not fully armed. After you whip him at Flintstone, he may attempt to escape by the Orleans road leading south, or by Back Creek Valley to the north. Please inform me which way he takes if he succeeds in getting away from you.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

HANCOCK, MD., August 1, 1864.

Major-General COUCH, Chambersburg, Pa.:

I overtook and attacked the enemy at this place last evening. An iron-clad car had endeavored to prevent their crossing, but it was driven away with artillery. Enemy sent over a party and destroyed the railroad buildings. I found them in line of battle on a strong position on this side, from which they fled after a short engagement. Controlling the ford with my guns the enemy could not cross, but my small force could not prevent him taking the road to Cumberland, upon which he kept up his flight during the night, felling trees and burning bridges, rendering it impossible for my weary command to continue the pursuit with any chance of success. I sent a messenger to Cacapon to telegraph to General Kelley the course taken, requesting that a railroad train be sent to take up my command dismounted, but have received no reply. If my train has not been sent with supplies, please forward it to Hagerstown, notifying me by telegraph at McConnellsburg.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

General KELLEY:

Scouts in report the rebels having passed Mrs. Bell's at 1 o'clock this a. m., going briskly toward Cumberland. What shall we do?

Captain.

[AUGUST 1, 1864.]

General KELLEY:

The wire not working west of Great Cacapon. We started west and got this far to see what was up. Wires had been cut near here by McNeill's men, who have now gone back from the road. Shall we go east from here?

P. B. PETRIE,

Captain.
