are likely to be high, and the bridges over some of them are of a slight and temporary character, and more or less dangerous to be used as a means of transit for so many valuable animals. If reliable and responsible parties would offer to deliver them at Fort Snelling for $ 8 per head, it would be better to contract with them, as the lowest estimate of the cost in the mode you suggest will be $ 6.50 each, and is likely to be more, with the risk of losing some of the horses separated. Captain Carling, chief quartermaster of the district, concurs with me in these opinions. I will, however, send down a detachment of cavalry in a day or two, to bring up such horses as may be ready at La Crosse. Please reply to this.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MILWAUKEE, WIS., March 31, 1864.
