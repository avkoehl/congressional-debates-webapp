DREWRY'S BLUFF, May 12, 1864 - 5 p. m.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

My old brigade is now getting on the boat, sothe officer in command reports. Kemper's brigade starts at once, whioch makes the two brigades called for. The enemy have been in front of me all day in terribly strong force. Ihave been fighting them outside of the works during the day andhave repulsed them. Their movements on this line will certainly be developed by mroning, and then I hope to be able to spare more troops with safety. I have been on the frotnline all day, which has coused delay in the delivery of dispartches.
