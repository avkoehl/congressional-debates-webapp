They surrendered to General Shackelford at 5 p. m. last evening. i have seen them myself. I think the Fifth Indiana and Fourteenth Illinois will finish up to-morrow, if other forces do not. Boats should be sent up with infantry guards as soon as possible to these points and Cheshire for prisoners. I shall be here till daylight, perhaps longer.

General MASON, Columbus, Ohio:

Commanding Officer, Lancaster, Ohio:

Morgan has escaped with about 500 men. He seems to be heading for the interior. The following dispatch, just received here, will show his direction?

HAMDEN, July 21.

Couriers just in report Morgan going up Raccoon Creek. They will strike this road near Vinton Station. Another man just in brings prisoner from Morgan's band. They were at Valley Furnace, 4 miles south, some three hours ago. Other parties confirm report. All agree that Morgan is heading for McArthur. No one puts Morgan's force at less than 500.

HUMPHREYS,

Operator.

Get your forces in readiness, and make your arrangements that an attack may be repelled in case he should attempt it. Reports the number and condition of your forces here. Our cavalry in close pursuit.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

POMEROY, July 21, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

I dare not trust the prisoners going down with the Cincinnati six-months' men. I will wait for Manson's or other infantry. The Fifth Indiana Cavalry found roads obstructed. I have detained the regiment for the present. It is needed as guard to prisoners. Shackelford was last night at Cheshire.

H. M. JUDAH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
