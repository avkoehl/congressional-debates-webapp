Colonel Kenly's command of infantry and cavalry has been driven from Front Royal, with considerable loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners. The enemy's force estimated at 5,000 or 6,000. It is reported as fallen back on Front Royal; probably occupies that place this morning.

Cannot give details this morning of our loss. The force of the enemy was very large; not less than 6,000 to 10,000. It is probably Ewell's force, passing through Shenandoah Valley.

Enemy's cavalry reported on the Winchester road this morning by our scouts.
