modified it, as a substitute for the fonrth sec-
tion of the Seriate bill.
The Clerk read as follows:
Seo. 4. And be it further enacted, That to secure a
better distribution of the national bank currency
there may bo issued circulating notes to banking
associations organized in States and Territories hav-
ing a less national banking circulation th aa five dol-
lars per inhabitant, but the amounto! each eircjiUr
tioashall not exceed$14,QOO,000. And. the circulation
herein authorized shall, within one year, be wire-
drawn from banks having a circulation exeeeding
$1,OOMIOO organized in States having a «ireolation
Exceeding that provided for by the. act approved
larcb 3,1865, entitled "An act to amend an aet eri-
titled 'An aet to providea national currency-secured
by a pledge of U nited States bonds, and to provide
for the circulation aaid redemption thereof;aud
from and after the passage of this act no national
bank shall be entitled to a circulation exceeding
#1.009,000.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, the first na-
tional currency act, passed February 25, 1808,
provided that—
"One hundred and fifty million dollars of tire-en-
tire aaionnt of the circulating notes authorized to
be issued shall be apportioned to associations in
States, in the District of Columbia, and in the Ter-
ritories according to the representative population ;
and the remainder shati be ain>ortu>ned t)y the Sec-
retary of the Treasu ry among associations formed in
the several States, in the District of Columbia, and
in the TerriteSies; having due regard to the existing
banking eanited; atcsoarees, and busi ess of such
States and Territories."
This proviso was repealed by the aet of June
30, 1864, and was retinae ted Marek 3, 1865.
Between„the time of the aet of February, 1863,
and that of June, 1864, very few-national banks
organized, and no apportionment was made.
Between the time of its repeal and its reeoact-
raent hanks in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania had
organized and obtained an amount of circula-
tion much in excess of what they would have
been entitled to under the provision making the
apportionment, Massachusetts, whieh, under
the apportionment., was entitled to $21,795,000,
obtained $57,084,640, an excess of 835,289,-
640; more than one hundred and fifty per cent,
above the amount to which she would have
been entitled unde.r the apportionment. New
York was entitled to $53,473,500. and obtained
$68,853,736, an excess of.gl§,380,22©; nearly
thirty pes cent, more than -the amount to which
she was entitled.' Pennsylvania, being entitled
to $2O,527,0(X), obtained §38,772,102, an ex-
cess of 812,245,102; nearly fifty per cent.
Why the provision apportioning the circula-
tion was repealed by the act of June, 1864, and
reenacted in March, 1865, Iain not informed;
but the effect of its repeal was to give to the
three States named $164,710,468 of the circu-
lation instead of $101,795,500, to which they
were entitled under the apportionment provis-
ion. This large excess of the circulation taken
in the States named has been mostly appro-
priated by the cities of Boston, New York,
and Philadelphia, as will appear by the fol
lowing table, showing the relative circulation
of the banks in the cities named and in the
States outside of those cities under the Slq£c
and national bank systems:

An increase of nearly three hundred percent,
over the circulation uuder the State bank sys-
tem in 1863.
The increase of circnlation for the same period
in theStates of Massachusetts, New York, and
Pennsylvania outside the cities named, was as
follows:

lation, £863.

Au increase of lew Uiau thirty per e«ut. «r
twenty per cent, less than the avenge increase
of national over State bank circulation through-
out the country.
Thus we see that while those three States
obtained so large au excess of the national
bank circulation the excess was all in the three
great cities ! have naroed^the other cities and
to wag having had actually less than their fair
■proportion-of the i acreage of circulation under
the national bank aet.
Following this increased circulation atill
iartker,.'we find it mostly appropriated by the
large hanksin Boston, New York, and Phila-
delphia, Under the State bank system of
1883, five banks in Boston bad $1,014,758.
Under the national banking system those same
five banks have $7,87d,000, an increase of
$6,860,242. Ih 1863, uuder the State hank
system, eight banks in the city of New York
had $1,566,950. They have now under the
national bank system, $16,251,666, an increase
of $14,684,716. One of the large banks in the
city of Philadelphia bad, under the Slate bank
system, $289,140. Under the national bank
system it is now entitled to $1,500,000, an
excess of $860,860, The total circulation of
these fourteen banks under the State bank-
ing system was $2,820,848. Under the na-
tional bank system it is $25,626,666, an in-
crease of $22,355,818. It thus appears that
the increase of ciraulation in those three States
shas been nearly all in the three large cities of
those States; and the larger proportion of it
la the larger banks of those cities which, be-
fore the war, under a State banking system
which allowed them all the circulation they
could keep afloat, had but a nominal circula-
tion of less than three million dollars. The
countrr "janks have increased their circulation
less than the general increase of banking cir-
culation under the national currency act.
Mr. RANDALL. To what bank in Phila-
delphia does the gentleman tefer as having a
circulation of $1,500,000?
Mr. LYNCH. The Farmers'and Mechanics'.
The report of the Comptroller of the Treasury
shows that this bank has less than a million
dollars of circulating notes outstanding. I have
named the circulation to which the bank is
entitled.
Mr. RANDALL. The entire capital of the
bank is but $1,500,000.
Mr. LYNCH. Its capital is $2,000,000. Itis
entitled to a circulation of $1,500,000, seventy-
five per cent of its capital.
The figures to which I have referred show
that Massachusetts, New York, aud Pennsyl-
vania have $62,914,068 more than their share
of the national bank circulation, the large part
of which has been appropriated by the cities
of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and
by the large banks in those cities. A compar-
ison .of the present circulation of those banks,
with the amount of their circulation under a
free banking system, shows that this circula-
tion is not demanded by the business of the
communities where they are located, but is
issued as a matter of profit to the banks, and
supplied by them to other sections of the eoun-
j try which are deprived of the privilege by the
limitations of the currency aet.
Now, as we are providing fora redistribution
of this national bank circulation ia order to
equalize it in some degree, is it  ot manifestly
just and proper that we shonld do it by taking
first from those sections and those banks which
have obtained the largest excess? Under the
amendment which I propose most of the amount
withdrawn for redistribution would come from
the large banks in the large cities, where cir-
culation is least needed for the transaction of
business. Why should we withdraw the ex-
I cess of the currency now held by banks ia the
; several States pro rata, when, as 1 have shown,
| there was such a disparity in the original distri-
; button of it? The large pet eentag® of the
| excess of the circulation over an equitable pro-
! portion being held by a few of the States is in
| the large banks of the large cities. Why should
I wot the first withdrawal be. from those banks?
! r Speaker, under the amendment that I
have proposed the.amount witbdnurn kmM he
some thing over fourteen tn-illi on dollars instead
of $20,000,000 as propose^ by the Senate bill
and by the House amendment. .4 think that
$14,000,000 would be allthatwouW be required,
and indeed all that could be takpn up within
one year from the present time ; and as I .have
shown it would all be withdrawn from those
large banks that do not require it for the trans-
action of the buginess of the section in which
they are located. Under the distribution pro-
vided for by the fourth section of the Senate
bill and by the amendment that has been pro-
posed by the Committee on Banking and Cur-
rency, this circulation would be withdrawn from
all the backs in all the States without regard
to the question as to whether these States or
these banks had originally received an excess in
the distribution of the currency. For instance,
in the State of New York the circulation of
every country bank would be cut dosvp. The
circulation of all with a capital less than
$200,000 would be euWiown ten percent.; all
over $200,000 and not over $500,000, twenty
per cent. This would be manifestly.unjust to
the whole interior of the State of New York,
because these banks to-day have not their fair
proportion of the increased circulation. The
same is true of Massachusetts outside of Bos-
ton, and of Pennsylvania outside of Phila-
delphia.
The country banks in those States have no
more circulation than they are etuisled to under
the apportionment of the cufMsney *c$, Why,
then, should, we take fro® these small-country
banks ftam ten-to twenty per cent, of their
circulation-in order that the excess within the
States in which they are located may be cut
down 1 Why should not this excess be taken
off of the large banks whose circulation has
been increased more than three hundred per
cent, under the currency act over what it was
under the State bank system, which allowed an
uuiimited circulation?
The amount of circulation withdrawn from
these large banks does not work to the injury
of the sections in which they are located; it
only lessens somewhat the profits of the banks.
They do not require the circulation for their
business. TbSy could not keep it in circulation
under a free bankiug system.^ Tbe Bank of
Commerce, in the eity of New York, with
§10,000,000 of capital, had less than $2,000
circulation under the State bank system in
1863, which allowed a bank to circulate all
it could secure and redeem, and yet that
bank to-day has nearly $6,000,000 in circu-
lation. Now every one must know that that
circulation is not called for by the business
of that bank or of the community in which it
is located.
The amendment which X have proposed will
leave New York city with two hundred per
cent, more circulation than it had before the
war. It will leave Boston nearly three hun-
hundred per cent., and Philadelphia four hun-
dred per cent, more than they had before the
war. It will leave an excess in the States of
Massachusetts, New York. and Pennsylvania
of $36,000,000 over the amount, to which they
are entitled under the currency aet, which is
more than the excess in all the other States.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I ask the
gentleman from Maine to yield to me.
Mr. LYNCH. I yield the remainder of my
hour to the gentleman from Massachusetts.
Mr. BUTLiiK, of Massachusetts. I do not
propose to occupy the time ol the House at
this moment further than to offer an amend-
ment, and then, under an arrangement with the
chairman of the committee, to yield tor twenty
minutes to the geBtietnan from Pennsylvania,
