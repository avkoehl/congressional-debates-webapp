reported by the Committee on Foreign Relations,
and last session we passed resolutions just as '
strong, and what did they amount to? To nothing
The Bntish Government, instead of giving up i
their claims, had advanced the claim to exclusive
jurisdiction over the disputed lerutoi y, and threat-
ened to suppoit it with an armed force     Under
these circumstances, he was foi putting the coun-
try in a situation to meet the threatened contin
gency      He saw nothing al liming in the author
lying this volunteer foice to be raised     Thevwi'I

I would ask the Senator fiom New Jersey what
is there in this bill which is not precisely in con-
formity with the resolutions unanimously adopted
last night' Which was the most important of all
these resolutions Was it not that one which de
claied that, if the Bntish Government should, in
puisuance of its avowed determination, attempt,
by mihtaiy force, to take possession of the dis-
puted territory, that we would sustain the Presi
dent in defending tnc lights of the country and
leprlling this invasion J This is the single pun
ciple cleaily ind stiongly expiessed in the fourth
resolution What, then, do we piopose to do by
this Lill■" Meiciy to cany out this principle in
practice, and that, too, in the mildest form con
sistently with the safety of the counti v Would
ave not make ouiselves a ndiculous spectacle be
fore all mankind, if we should aujouui, aftei
adopting this solemn resolution, and leive the
President without a dollai to defend the countiy
m case it should be attacked * We fust pledge
ou i sel vis, m the most solemn mannei, to s t stain
htm and, when called upon to led eem our pledge,
we pioae lecieant to this duty which, but yestei
day, we imposed upon ourselves Is there a single
Senatoi heie prepaied to act such a ¡ art?
The b II ]•>, in fact, but little mou than a con-
tingent tppiopnation of 5>10,00U,000, placed at

1'ut this bill is called a threat A tinea*' To
prepue fai wai when an intuition to invade oui
terutotj has 1 een avowed, is a thitat which may
offend our powe-ful ntiglibii' Such was not
the opnuc i of Gencial Washington He be
heved tint to piepaie foi war was the best mode
of prese ing peace Weakness alwajs invites
agsiessioi Foitunately, oi unfoitunately, for
us, fiom the verj natdie of our institutions, we
shall never bo well prepared for wai, but foi this
very leason, when vve have cause to appiehend
immediate danger, out exertions ought to be so
much the moie vigorous     We now find that Sir
John Harvey is collecting and concentiatmg his
forces, which it is said will amount to four or five
thousand regular troops, with the avowed purpose
of making a descent on the disputed territory,
and placing it under the exclusive jurisdiction of
England When this dangei is impending, shall
we place oui selves in the contemptible position of
1 resolving that the State of Maine shall be de-
fended, and then íeresolvmg that it shall not be
defended, lest it might give offense to the British
Government' We can never avert war by base
submission and if we could, the people of this
countiy w ill n ver purchase peace at the price of
self degiadation ]\o, sir, nevei If the British
Government shou'd ever complain of this hill as
a threat, oui Minister can point with confidence
to the lettei and proclamation of Sir John Harvey,
in which he has fust tlneatened to take military
possession of the disputed temtoiy, under the
cxpitss command of his sovereign He can
snow that the menace fust came from hei Majes-
ty's Government, and that oui proceedings, have
beenpuiely d< fensive This bill contains no pro-
vision vmch goes fuithei than adopting the ne
cessaiy means of self defence, m case a foreign
foe should invade oui native land If my neigh-
bor should be in the v^ry act of attempting- to
deprive me of my pioperty by foice,and Ishouid
stand upon the defensive, he might, with the
same piopiiety, turn about and accuse toe of
thrtateiimg him
Whilst 1 aminfavoi of defending thejust rights
of Maine to tht last extremity, [ am also dis-
posed to lnfoim hei distinctly, that if, in viola-
tion of the Constitution, which confeisunon the
Executive of the Tjnnn the tieaty making power,
and in viol itnn of the clou subsisting under-
standing between th*. pai tits, she vv ill become the
aggiessei, and attempt nctmaiently to occupy
tin disp itt d tPiii ny by force, we are under no
constitutional ob'igatio i to com to lui aid,how-,
evei difficult it might be even m such a case, to
lesist her appeal In the 1 mgi agt of the amend-
ment made to the fouith res Mition,it is hei duty
to leave thi ultimate vindication of her lights to
the Geneial Goverim nt, to w Inch it rightfully
and constitutionally belongs Hands off from
this temtoiy on both sidis, while negotiations
aie pending Dining this period, the question
belongs exclusively to the General Goveinment,
It would be forever a souicc of regiet, both to
M une heis If and to the whole countiy, if she
should not withdiaw hi r foices fiom this tern-
lory, in case feu John Haivoy should set hei the
exampie, desisting fiom attempting its military
occupation
I depiecate wai but in a just cause I do not
dlead it If it should come now it will bo lnev-
l abl , and we may appeal to the world foi the
justice of our cause Oui couise has thitherto
bei n coriect in asseiting oui rights I trust and
believe that Mame will not embarrass us in pur-
suing it to the end That she has cause to com-
plain, I cheeifully admit, but let hei continue to
rely upon the Genual Government, and when
the crisis shall anive, if ainve it must, she will
find the countiy as one man rushing to her
lescue On the contrary, should the patriotic,
but excited, feeling which now seems to pervade
hei citizens, duve thpm into acts of aggiession,
and involve us in war, the best cause will be
vve kened by such conduct, and distiaction and
division among the citizens (t the othei States
may be tl e consequence Let hei be prudentas
well as film This contioveisy must soon be
ended, either by legotia'ion or by aims Let
her patiently and patnotiea ly await the tesult,
unless the teintory should be actually invaded
The question was heie taken on Mi South-
ard's motion to refer the bill to the Committee
