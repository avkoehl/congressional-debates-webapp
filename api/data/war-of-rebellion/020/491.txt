I do not, however, hesitate to say that in my opinion it is advisable that women and children should leave the city at once.

Major General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Charleston:

GENERAL: It is not in my power at this time to send you re-enforcements, and I wish the surplus transportation referred to in your letter of April 23 to be sent to this place as soon as possible. The Quartermaster-General advises that your surplus wagons be sent by Northeastern Railway to Cheraw, under direction of an officer, and proceed thence to Danville by the ordinary roads.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I learn indirectly from Captain R. M.

I have had batteries constructed on the bluff at the lower end of the city, for which guns of the heaviest caliber are desirable. Should the enemy succeed in passing the batteries on the flats below the city with these guns in position on the bluff the city itself might perhaps still be held.

I am, &c.,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
