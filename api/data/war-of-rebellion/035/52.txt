From cavalry reconnaissance made on south side of river yesterday, we find enemy gone to Columbia. We captured 8 with their horses, wounding 1 man severely.

S. D. BRUCE,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

NASHVILLE, February 9, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The First East Tennessee Cavalry have just returned from a hard expedition in with General Davis. Their horses are nearly all barefooted. Time should be given them here to get their horses shod, to put their regiment on an effective footing. I have consulted with General Mitchell, and he concurs in this opinion. I hope that Captain Abbott's battery, now at Clarksville, will be permitted to return here and join the rest of the Tennessee forces. I think I will come with General Mitchell. I hope a few days will be granted them, at least.

ANDREW JOHNSON,

Military Governor.
