U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, December 9, 1864-4.10 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

Orders relieving General Thomas had been made out when his telegraph of this p.m. was received. If you still wish these orders telegraphed to Nashville they will be forwarded.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., December 9, 1864-5.30 p.m. (Received 6 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

General Thomas has been urged in every way possible to attack the enemy, even to the giving the positive order. He did say he thought he would be able to attack on the 7th, but didn't do so, nor has he given a reason for not doing it. I am every unwilling to do injustice to an officer who has done as much good service as General Thomas has, however, and will, therefore, suspend the order relieving him until it is seen whether he will do anything.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CLARKSVILLE, December 9, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

I reconnoitered the river to-day as far as the best pilots thought practicable, but saw nor heard nothing of interest.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

NASHVILLE, December 9, 1864-8.30 p.m.

Admiral S. P. LEE,

Clarskville:

Your dispatch of this date is just received. If you have any gunboats at Clarksville with you, I will be obliged if you will send as many as you can spare to Smithland, to convoy transports with cavalry on board as far up the river as Clarksville. I have not heard from Captain Fitch since he started down the river this morning.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
