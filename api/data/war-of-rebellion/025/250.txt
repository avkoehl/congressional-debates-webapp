HEADQUARTERS NEAR CORINTH, MISS.,October 1, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.

For several days there has been a movement of the rebels south of my front, which left it in doubt whether Bolivar or Corinth was to be the point of attack. It is now clear that Corinth is to be the point, and that from the west or southwest. Price, Van Dorn, Villepigue, and Rust are together. Rust commands Breckinridge's forces, the latter having gone to Kentucky, by Mobile and Chattanooga, taking three regiments with him. My position is precarious, but hope to get out of it all right.
