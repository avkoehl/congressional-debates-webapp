WASHINGTON, August 30, 1862.

P. H. WATSON, Esq.,

Assistant Secretary of War:

SIR: General Halleck desires me to say that General Pope wishes ammunition, and especially for artillery, to be sent at once to Centreville. The general has communicated this to General McClellan, General Banks, the chief of ordnance, and the chief quartermaster at Alexandria, and requests that you will do what you can to hasten and facilitate this matter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. THOM,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 30, 1862.

Major-General BANKS, Manassas, Va.:

General Pope is in want of ammunition, particularly for artillery. We will send from Alexandria as soon as possible. Cannot you send some to him from Manassas?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

MANASSAS JUNCTION, VA.,

August 30, 1862 - 1.45 p. m.(Received 2.30 p.m .)

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch received. There is artillery and other ammunition in my train near Centreville. Sixteen wagons went up last night. I have many more wagons on the road now near this place, which can be moved directly to him if I knew where to send them. Please inform me.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, August 30, 1862 - 2 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

Yours of 5 a. m. is received. All matters have been attended to. Thirty thousand men are marching to your said.

Franklin should be with you now and Sumner to-morrow morning. All will be right soon, even if you should be forced to fall back. Let your army know that heavy re-enforcement are coming.

Yours, truly,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major-General BANKS, Manassas, Va.:

General Pope's headquarters were at Groveton this morning. You can judge best from the firing where he now is. The enemy this morning was said to be falling back toward the mountains.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
