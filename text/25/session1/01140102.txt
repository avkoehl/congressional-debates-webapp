traordmary attack of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts.
Sir, it tb peifectly well known, at least to some
members, that, upon this bank question—upon the
tariff question and upon the interference of this
Federal Government, or State Legislatures, with
the affairs of trade and money, I have been uniform
and consistent, ami, after seventeen years, Í have
the pleasure to find myself surrounded by gentle-
men from every part of the Union advocating 'he
same doctrines I advocated before I was a mem-
ber of this House
Sir, in. alluding to the gent'eman from Massa-
chusetts the other day, I did it m a pleasant man-
ner, and not for the purpose of provoking an attack
Upon me. Tke gentleman had alluded to I he pro-
position now submitted to the nation and to Con-
gress, I mean the proposition *o separate the affars
of this Government and our Treasury from all
connection with banks In alluding to that propo-
sition, he had reference to the published opinion of
the gentleman, who doubted whether the President
had the courage to piopose it, and if he had the
courage to do so, the gentleman left us in some
doubt, whether he v¡ ould help him out of the diffi-
culty.
Now, I liad hoped the gentleman would have
giver  us hts aid oa that bill, and why? Because
I did not think the gentleman would vote for a
proposition to incorporate an association of coun-
terfeiters, because I could not suppose it possible
that the gentleman could denounce all the presi-
dents, cashiers, and directois, of all the banks, and
afterwards come here and vote foi ?n association
of counterfeiters. The gentleman told us in that
letter that he doubted, as> well he might, the expe-
diency of employwgany bank of discountas an agent
of the-Government Now, there is no Government
upon earth which employs a bank of discount
Even the Bank of England is not a bank of dis-
count, according to its pneiice or its oigmvaliun
not a bank of commercial discount upon the plan
of the banks of t'ns country The public moneys
are not permitted to be employed m commercial ■
discounts, to be suddenly withdrawn. Sir, I rose
merely to remind the gentleman that on these
questions I wished him to remove all doubt—to toe
the mark on the resolution against chartering a na-
tional bank.
Mr. GLASCOCK was somewhat astonished that
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr Sergeant)
after occupying the time of the House on three
different mornings dur ng tV morning hour, should
move to commit the resolution to the Committee of
the Whole on the state oí the Union Jf he could
believe for a moment tnat any good could lesult
from it, lie would not interpose the objection he now
made, but so far as this question was concerned, it
appeared to him that every gentleman had a full
and fair opportunity offered him of making known
bis views to the House and to his constituents, in
relation to the establishment of a national bank, in
Committee of the Who'e, on tnc bills befoie that
committee This being the case, he v. as surprised
that the gentleman should have made the mo-
tion after he had finished his o\\ n lematks It was
also he thought very extiaordinary that the gentleman
from Massachusetts should have made the motion
to lay the resolution on Ihe table, pfter asimilar
motion had been rejected by a large majority of the
House He hoped the motion to commit mHit
not prevail, because we had but some tight or ten
davs to determine on pll the great questions be-
í -lie the House, and the morning houi, he took it

Mr   CLARK  was some\ hit  surprised  at the
gent'eman from Pennsvlvanit making this motion
at the present time, after the indulgence xvhieh had
b-en given bun by the House     It  seemed to him
that there mas business «nough before the House, ,

the public stomach is sick of it, and he hoped we j
would not ro  hear any more of this bank w ar
The battle has been fought and won, and why re-
new the contest' A charge has been brought agam^t
the Committee of Ways and Means for not
hiving read the different petitions and memorials
retcrred to it on the subject of a national bank
Why, sir, these petitions are as familiar to the
people of the countiy as household terms We all
know where they are got up They are sent from
tne punting offices of the eity of New York through
the country for signatures, and are all of the same
kind He hoped this question of a Bank of the
United States was not now to be fought over again
General Jackson had had the good fortune to
harpoon this leviathan, and he hoped the question
might be left at rest lo> the present
Mr. ROBERTSON thought it surprising that the
House should be called upon to vote on this impor-
tant question, without the opportunity of a full and
free discussion He thought the proper course
would be to commit it to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, so that eve-y
gentleman would have the opportunity of giving
his views upon it, and if there was not time to
dispose of it at the present session, it would remain
on the table to be considered at the coming session.
Mr. WISE concurred m opinion with his col-
league He said there were three distinct plans
before the country, suppoited by the thiee different
patties m the House One was the Sub-Treasury
sjstem, submitted by the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means as a positive plan, and
tne other was a positive plan, submitted by the
gentleman fiom Virginia, (Mr Garland,) who be-
longed to the conservative party jn the House, and
both these plans were refen ed to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union The other
was a negative proposition, introduced by the gen-
t'eman from New York, (Mr Cambreleng ) Tins
negame pioposmon the gcntlem-m sees fit to ke p
cenfined to a few minutes' discu«sion ever} morn-
ing, instead of giving lo it the same chanee
for free d jcussion w hicht he ther two plans have
in Committee of the Whol He objected to this
course, and he objected to having this issue present-
ed at this time, and in this form. He did not de-
sire this summary mode of execution for the bank.
He did not desire to see this vote, taken without
debate, held up to the country as another triumph
over the bank, but he wished to bee a clean avenue
for discussion, where he could meet the gentleman
fro n New York on the question in every point in
which it w?s presented, and this he hoptd th>y
would be able to obtain

TREASURY NOTE BILL.
The House, on meeting in the evening session
\vent into Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union, Mr CONNOR m the chau, and
resumed the consideration of the "bill to authonze
the issuing of Treasuiy notes," with the amend-
ment to, or substitute therefor, of Mr Rhett
Mr. DUNN bnely opposed the bill, and gave
notice of his intention to submit an amendment,
w hen it w as m order to do so
The amendment of Mi RHETT was dis-
agreed to
Mr WILLIAMS of North Caiolma, also op-
posed the b 11
Mr DAWSON moved an amendment to restrict
the number of clerks to four, and. limiting their
compensation to ^1200 to each
Mi CAMBRELENG had no objection to the
amendment
Mr McICAY suggested the introduction of the
words "per annum," uhich Mr D4WS0N accept-
ed as i modification, and so modified, ihe amend-
ment was icrped to
Mr RIVES moved to strike out the second
clause of the bill, which provides that the notes
should bear inteiest He explained, as the íeason
of his motion, that he was in favor of the bill as
originally reponed in the House from the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, that bill not providing
that the notes should bear interest [This was the
mam distinction between the House and Senate
bills, the latttr maknig the notes bear interest, the
former not ]
Mr SNYDER said he would vote for the amend-
ment of the chairmpm of the Committee of Ways
and Means, if we were under the necessity of is-
suing ten millions of paper money, for one, he
thought it important that the paper should be of
equal value with specie, unless it is, the conse-
quences will be fh.Pt the issue of fh'S paper will
adl to, in place of dimimshim;, the etil -"inch at
present exists, for, disguise this ?s >ou may, it is
a debt which we are involving the na* on m to the
amount of ten million of dollars I have been in
the habit of always legis'ating in a manner that my
constitueuts would understand my lets, hence I
would much prefer a loan of ten m IIions to the
present propose I mode of issh ng warrants to that
ami unt, ledeemible m one jear, for, depend upon
it, if we keep our faith with the States, we have
lenmtllions to pay them in 1839 Theie isnowa de-
ficit mlhe Treasury of two millions and upwards,
this, together with the ordinaly expenditure of the
Government, will consume all the contemplated
revenue of the next year, and at the end of that
time, the money must be raised to redeem the wai-
rants, and rest assured that the people will un-
derstand it, when they are called upon to pay it.
It is objected to, that if these warrants bear inte-
rest, they will be anxiously sought for, and being
more valuable than specie, the}' wi'I be locked up,
and withheld fiom circulation Admit this, it will
tike ten millions of specie or its equiva'ent to with-
draw from emulation the warran's, thus adding
to the means of the banks to resume specie piy-
ment Not only the wants of the people, but the
character of our Government, urpeiious'y de-
mands that we should issue none other than
a circulating milium which would íelievc the de-
ranged state of the currency, and hav e an equal
value with specie I repeat, sir, I wouid prefer a
loan to the o hum of issuing a paoer curr^i cv, not
based on a specie capital, and wnicb. tee taxes of
our constituents must m the end p?y
The amendment v. as further briefly discussed by
Messrs RIVES, HA YNES and CAMBRLLENG,
wne i
Mr CHAMBERS, of Kentucky, moved that
the committee rise, but mbsequentl} withdrew the
motior
Mr BELL suggested that the question be taken
on the several amendments, the bdl laid aside to bo
repoited, and th" fuither discussion be hid in the
House He v. as a'so willing that ail the hills should
be repoited eailj, except the last, (the Sab Trea-
siny b heme.)
Mr UNDERWOOD gave notice of a substitute
he intended to offer, containing two propositions
' 1 To authorize a sale, at par, of the bonds upon
the Pennsylvania Bank oí the United States, and
2 That if the Secrttaiy of the Tieasury cannot
sell those bonds, that he borrow the same amount
of money, (viz §6,500,000,) at a rate of mteiest
not exceeding six per cent per annum
Mr. RIVES modified his amendment by moving,
instead of striking out the second section,  to insert
