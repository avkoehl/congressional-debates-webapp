THE CONGRESSIONAL (ÍLOBE.
February 19,
•were enabled to make daily (settlements, and strike
daily balances, but the country banks had no
such opportunity He -would put a stroi g case
The Choctaw lands were in market, and the de-
posite bank at Natchc* had necessatily, at occa
sion&l times, a large amount of the public money,
and the roc ivers being compelled to receive, not
specie, but notes of the Batik of the United States,
how wouid the deposite bank be able to answer
the call iequired by the above amendment? In
September last yecr, the amount of public de
posttes m that bank was half a million or«iore,
and in January of the present year, it was neaily
nine hundred thousand dollars Some of this
was in notes payable in Philadelphia, some in
Boston, New York, and other cities, and of all the
branches, perhaps, in the Union, for it was required
to receive them and what dm the amendment pro-
pose ' Why, that they should not crJunt anything
as specie tl at was not metallic It would be com-
pelled instantly to transmit to Boston, Savannah,
.New York, and other places, the notes payable
there, and receive their balances back to Natchez
This would take months in transmitting, besides
running a great risk in the double transportation
Nor was this all Dunng the time the deposite
bank was lying out of all this money she must
procure specie, at whatever cost, so as to keep up
the requisite proportion, although the deposites
were made in notes of the Bank of the United
States In other words, you would be requiring
the deposite bank to receive the paper of the Bank
ot the United States, and not specie, while, at the
same time, you would require that bank to answer
for the same notes in specie, losing the interest
upon and use of the money, by the time consumed
m procuring the balances and returns from the
Bank of the United States He affirmed that at
no period since the Bank of the United States
came into operation could the bank, or any one
of its brioches, have stood up under such a
restriction as that proposed by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, nor was a provision of such a
character ever required before
Mi P had procured the several official returns
of the branches of the Bank of the United States,
which all showed that they could not ha\e existed
under such a restriction Take one, the branch
at Mobile On the 1st of A pul, 1833, before the
> public deposites were removed from the Bank of
the United States, it had of public and private
deposites, notes in circulation, &c , over and above
what was owing to the bank, $8,631 000 Now,
according to theamendment proposed, this branch
bank should have had #526 200, being one-fifth, so
fm from it, that it had only ¿136,000 in specie and
speciepaying banks The branch bank at Natchez,
at the same peiiod, had, of public and private
deposites, and notes in circulation, $1,531,000,
while of specie, and notes of specie paying banks,
it had only $76,000 to meet these liabilities, about
a twentieth, instead of a fifth This would be the
result of carrying out the punciple of the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, that it would be destruct
ive of the whole system of local depositories
Mr P would call upon all those gentlemen who
desired this system to be carried out, to examine
this point thoroughly, and they would see that if
this amendment was adopted, it would be imprac-
ticable, and would tend to dnve them out of the
public service, and thiow the public treasury
into the hands of receivers, or to compel the rees-
tabhshment of a national bank, a contingency
■which would inevitably follow The provision
was altogether a novel one, and had never been
imposed upon the Bank of the United States or
its branches It added no greater security for the
public moneys, it was no additional guarantee,
and the provisions of the bill offered sufficient
secunty Mi P here referred to several of them,
such as the limited powers with which the Secre-
tary of the Treasury was clothed, &e
There was another view of the matter The
Bank of the United States was not compelled to
take the notes of every other bank unless she
chose to do so, while the deposite bank was com-
pelled to take hers, and to keep a proportionate
amount of specie for it also By the amendment
they would be compelled to inciease their specie,
as money might be paid in, and to hold it from
circulation, however necessary it might be
Mr P said, without intending any disrespect to
the honorable member fiom Pennsylvania, [Mi
Bivnet,] and without supposing any such inten-
tion could have been entertained by thatgentleman,
yet theconviction forced itself upon Mr P 'smind
that the source of the amendment had been pre-
pared by that portion of the intelligent men in this
country who were most desirous (h e would not say
from improper motives) for the establishment of a
national bank The effect of all the amendments,
if finally adopted by the House, would be to
embarrass those new fiscal agents of the govern-
ment, and to bring them at least into disrepute
No plan could have been devised more effectually
than these amendments Why should these de-
posite banks be required to do what had never
been done by the Bank of the United States or by
any othei bank' He alluded now particularly to
the requisition that a monthly publication of the
affairs of each deposi'e bank thioughout the coun-
try should be made in three newspapers in the
city of Washington, so that then condition might
be exposed to the Bank of the United States and
to other banks, whilst the condition of the Bank
of the United States,and all theother banks, would
be concealed By doing this, the Bank of the
United States would be enabled to select then
victim, and by means of its extensive changes and
m otner way3, concentrate its immense power to
crush one of those fiscal agents, and thus, by pro
ducinga temporary interruption tobusiness,embar-
lass the whole country We were at no loss to
know what would be the effect of public clamor
The experience of the past year, especially from
the temporary suspension of two or three banks in
this District, proved what might be done Mr
P bad no doubt that there were those who would
have íejoiced to have seen every institution of the
kind in the counti y stop specie payments, reckless
of the rum that might be brought about theieby
You would first require a certain pioportion of
specie to be kept in each bank upon the amount
of its deposites, at the same time paying in those
deposites, not in specie, but in paper of other
banks Not content with this, they must publish
in the newspapers a monthly expose of all their
affairs' Where was the necessity for this' Under
the bill returns were to be made to the Treasury,
and every guarantee had been thi own around trat
was considered forcible and practicable at the game
time
What was the next provision } The first was
that of requiring a certain amount of specie in
proportion to the liabilities The second was
that throwing open the condition of each bank
And the third was that the deposite banks should
pay interest on the pub! c money in their hands
Mr P would ask, had interest eser been required
of any depositery from the foundation of this Gov-
ernment up to the present time' It was scarcely
necessary to go mt^this branch of the argument
The subject was also amply discussed at the last
■session of Congress Whatduties had these fiscal
agents to perform ' They would have to perform
the duties of pension agent, without any allow
anee or compensation, except for (¿ie actual cost
of books and stationery They had to furnish
the Government with facilities in collecting, re-
ceiving, and disbursing the public money, and in
this way alone, he would venture to affirm, there
wo%ld be a gieat saving to the Government Be
sides, how could interest bechaiged for the use
of money, the amount of which was hable to such
fluctuation ai the public deposites Mr P felt no
hesitation, then, in saying that if you imposed
such haid terms upon these banks, you would be
duven to select those of a second rate character,
instead of the best, the mostsolvent,and the most
efficient He hoped and trusted that the plan for
the employment of these banks would not be so
crippled with regulations as to make it altogether
impracticable
The gentleman from Pennsylvania thought the
system must fail Pe mit him (Mr P ) to say
that if the bill should have thrown around it the
provisions proposed by that gentleman, in his
judgment, those institutions would be so tram
melled and fettered as to render it very difficult,
perhaps wholly impracticable, for many of them
to succeed They would th en have to resort eith er
to the scheme of the gentleman from Virgima or
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, or be thrown
back again upon a national bank    Tha gentle-
man from Pennsylvania distinctly averred that
the system could not succeed, unless it shou'd
be conver'ed into a national bank, he also avowed
his hostility to this bill in any and -every form
or si ape in which it could be presente1, and he
informed the House at the outset that he intended
*o voteagamstit rhegemlemaii,a]so, furthertold
the House that if they passed the bill, the respon-
sibility wou'd be upon them, if they rejected it,
the responsibility would be elsewhere 1 he gen
lleman had predicted that the whole system must
fail, and that the scheme was altogether imp>-acii
cable Now, Mr P submitted to the gentleman
whether it was fair to that part of the House
who differed in opinion with himself, and who
thought it a practicable scheme, to embarrass that
scheme with these amendments, and strive to
render it wholly mopei itive' To put the pro¡ osed
piovision. into this bill, would, indeed, have this
effect
The gentleman from Pennsylvania further said,
that the success of theSti e banks as fiscal agents
of the Government, for the last six months, was
mainly to be attributed to the forbearance exer
jpised by the Bank of the United States during the
spring of 1834, and the effect of the panic For-
bearance of the Bank of the United States' Mr
P then knew not what forbearance was, but he
d d know that during the whole of last session
nothing was heard or seen but one general stream
of invective from the party sustaining the bank,
that that institution could not extend us accom-
modations, because, on account of the removal of
the deposites, they were compelled to make pro-
visions to pay off their own liabilities So far
from forbearing, we were again and again assuied
that the bank had been rendered powerless, and
could not relieve the country but as soon as Con-
gress adjourned wesawaconesponrtence between
the bank and a committee of merchants of New
York, in which the bank said, that as Congress
had adjourned without doing its duty, it would
then generously extend its loans Was the panic
got up by the friends of the State banks, or by
their opponents' By the fnends or enemies of
the bank' The whole country would give but
one response to this question
Mr P wished to set the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania right as to another fact The gentleman
had said that the effect of the panic had been to
dimmish the importation of foreign articles of
commerce, but he .must have overlooked the íe-
turnsfiom the Treasury Depaitment If he would
turn to them, he will see that, so far fiom our im-
portation trade having decreased, it had increased
to an amount of fourteen millions over any other
year
Mr B1NNEY explained He had referred to
the increase of importations in specie, and a dimi-
nution of other ameles
Mr POLK Still the Treasury returns showed
a great increase The argument of the gentleman
fiom Pennsylvania, that the panic had produced
an influx of specie into the country, was falla-
cious It was true that more specie was im-
ported during the year 1834, but then the amoui t
of imports of goods, or general fabrics, had not
diminished, and this fact was borne out by official
statements The country, then, has been pros-
perous, but she is indebted for that pros] enty
neither to the bark nor to the panic, but to the
new impulses springing out of the employment of
State ban',s as fi cal agents of the Government,
to which the*bank and its friends had been the
most inveterate enemies, and did all in then
power to sweep them from the face of the earth
They have stood up against the power of tl at
institution, and the effe"ts of the panic also, and
have been, so fai, successful The gentleman
said that the parallel case of those banks, as for-
merly exis'ing, vi? between the years 1789 and
1816, during which they were constantly employed
as fiscal agents, and did not hold good, because
(said he) there was then as much specie in the
country as now, and moreover, that the calamity
of their inability came at last But the gentle-
man's argument did not hold good, for the coun-
try was then only just liberated from an expen
sive wai, Tiie cause of their fai'ure ought to be
ascribed to their having made their issues too
large, many of them, he believed, from patuolic
motives, and were not able to meet the sudden
