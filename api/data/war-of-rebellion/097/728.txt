Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I find it impossible to have your orders to withdraw the troops belonging to this army at City Point executed, in consequence of the interference of Brigadier-General Patrick, who continues to exercise control over them in the face of my orders. General Patrick has also assumed to retain a battalion of the Fourteenth Infantry which I had ordered General Patrick has also assumed to retain a battalion of the Forteenth Infantry which I had ordered to the front. I understood the duties heretofore executed by these troops would now be performed by troops of the Army of the James. I have therefore to request you will instruct Brigadier-General Patrick to this effect and request him not to detain troops under my orders, or in case circumstances of these troops (that is, those formerly at City Point), the Fourteenth Infantry I desire to join me.
