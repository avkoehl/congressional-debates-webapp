River, and be employed in obtaining intelligence of the movements of hostile vessels and the landing of troops on either side of the river. It is important that you particularly watch the landings in the vicinity of Grove Wharf, on the left bank, and Stonehouse Wharf, on the right bank, below Jamestown, and endeavor to give notice to the troops on either bank. A body of infantry guard the former point, and a troop of cavalry, commanded by Captain Ruffin, patrol the country about Burwell's Bay, to convey intelligence to the troops at Suffolk. It is suggested that you establish a system of signals, as a means of communication with the troops, and taken every precaution not to jeopardize the safety of your boat by proceeding too far beyond the protection of the guns of the batteries. You will report to the commanding officer of Jamestown Island, to whom a copy of your orders will be sent.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.

Colonel J. B. MAGRUDER, Commanding Yorktown, Va.:

COLONEL: A requisition has just been made for eight 32-pounders, of twenty-seven cwt., and four 42-pounder carronades, for the defense of the land approaches to Yorktown; also for four boats, for service in York River, capable of transporting four or five hundred men each. These will be sent as soon as possible to Captain Whittle, at West Point, who will forward them to Yorktown. If Captain Whittle should think it expedient to do so, he is authorized to send to Yorktown the guns that are intended for Gloucester Point, and to replace them when the above-named requisition is filled, if they are not wanted immediately at Gloucester Point.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., June 18, 1861.

Colonel J. B. MAGRUDER, Commanding Yorktown, Va.:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 16th instant, addressed to General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General, C. S. Army, reporting the position of the troops under your command and the number of effective men, has been received. It always has been the intention to send additional troops to the Yorktown district as fast as they became available, and this arrangement will be continued until a sufficient number is obtained. As regards the guns which you report necessary for the land defense at Yorktown, they also have been forwarded for that and contiguous points as fast as they could be provided. I cannot learn of any requisition having been made by you for ammunition for the water batteries, but I take pleasure in informing you that fifty shells, properly fused, were forwarded to you yesterday. The laboratory at this point is so small that it does not furnish facilities for rapidly making fuses. More shells with fuses can, however, be sent you if desired.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
