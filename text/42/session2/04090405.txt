REPORTS OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. SHERMAN, from the Committee on
Finance, reported an amendment intended to
be proposed to the bill (S. No. 2) to regulate
the service in the collection of customs at the
various ports of entry in tbe United States,
and the disposition of fines, penalties, and for-
feitures incurred under the laws relating to
customs, and for other purposes ; which was
ordered to be printed.
Mr. WRIGHT. The Committeo on Finance,
to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 330) to
provide for the relief of sufferers by fire at
Chicago, have instructed me to report it back
with an amendment, striking out the second
section, and to recommend its passage as thus
amended. I will state that this report is made
tocnabl? the Senators from Illmoistobe heard
on this question now, or at such time as they
desire ; and after they are thus heard, if it is
their wish that the bill should be recommitted,
I do not think that the committee will object.
Mr. WILSON. The Committee on Mditary
Affairs, to whom was referred the bill (S. No.
07) for tho relief of the purchasers of lots, and
houses and lots, sold by virtue of an act of Con-
gress entitled "An act providing for the sale
of the lands, tenements, and water privileges
belonging to the United States at and near
Harper's Fen-}', in the county of Jefferson,
West Virginia," approved December 15, 18G8,
have directed me to report, it back without
amendment, and I should like to have it put
on its passage now.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut Let the bill
be read, subject to objection.
The bill was read.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. I do not
understand that bill, Mr. President. I see that
it speaks of West Virginia, and refers to some
matters in that State. My colleague, who has
had charge of the matter relating to the saie
of lands at Harper's Ferry, is not here.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This is a bill
reported by the Committee on Military Affairs,
allowing purchasers of Iqts at Harper's Ferry
further time for payment.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. I do not
desire to oppose it-
Mr. NYE. It had better go over, and let
us go on with the morning business.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will lie
over, and reports of committees are still in
order.
Mr. CAMERON. The Committee on For-
eign Relations desire to be discharged from
the further consideration of the request of the
Russian Government for the renewal of two
bonds of $1,000 eachâ€”a claim made try the
captain of the Russian steamer Kornileff.
The committee ask to be discharged,because
the Government has already provided a proper
tvuv of a redemption in such cases.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The particular
paper which the Senator from Pennsylvania
has sent to tbe desk does not seem to have
passed through the Secretary's office.
Mr. CAMERON. The committee ask to
be discharged from the consideration of a peti-
tion of an officer of the Russian service who
has a claim for bonds lost. There was no
evidence before the committee that he did lose
them, and besides that, the laws of Congress
provide a remedy for getting them if they were
lost. The committee desire to be discharged
from the consideration of that petition.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The petition
itself seems to have been mislaid. If t here be
no objection, the committee will be discharged
from its further consideration.
Mr. CAMERON. I am directed by the
Committee on Foreign Relations to report the
following resolution, and to ask that it be acted
on immediately:
Jtesoleed, That the President of the United States
be requested to transmit to the Senate, ifnotineom-
patiblo with the public interest, any information in
his possession concerning the seizure and retention
by tho revolutionary forces in Venezuela of the
American steamers Hero, Dudley Buck, Nutrias,
and San Fernando, the property of tho Venezuelan
Steam Transportation Company, an American cor-
poration, and tho virtual imprisonment of tho offi-
cers of these vessels, who aro American citizens.
By unanimous consent, the Senate proceeded
to consider the resolution.
Mr. EDMUNDS. It struck me in hearing
the resolution that perhaps we were assum-
ing too much to decide which are the revolu-
tionary forces. We can get the information
by calling on the President, to give us all the
information he has touching the seizure of
these vessels in the waters of that country
without undertaking to decide which are the
revolutionary forces there.
Mr. CAMERON. I have no objection to
the amendment.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the resolution will be modified in the
manner indicated.
The resolution, as modified, was agreed to.
