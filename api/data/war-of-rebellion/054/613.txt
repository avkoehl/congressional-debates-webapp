as far as practicable up and down the Hatchie,to watch all the crossings and destroy all the means of crossing that stream. I was further advised that the general commanding division would hold his command near La Grange for the present,in view of information relative to an attack from below. I was directed to remain in the vicinity of Bolivar until further orders,&amp;c.

I have the honor to report my arrival at Bolivar at about 6 p.m. I learned that night that the ferry-boat which Forrest had taken to the mount of Clover had been moved to Estenaula,some distance below,on the morning of December 24, 1863. I therefore sent two companies, F and M, to destroy a ferry crossing some 7 miles above Bolivar. Sent also A Company,to proceed to mount of Clover and destroy any means of crossing the rebels might have at that point. I then moved directly to Westville,12 miles west of Bolivar,thence in the direction of Estenaula,as you will see by the inclosed map.*On arriving within 4 1/2 miles of Estenaula,we came upon the rebel pickets,and immediately attacked three rebel regiments under command of General Richardson. We succeeded in driving these regiments to the Slough Bridge, 1 1/2 miles this side of Estenaula, at which point we were unable to drive them farther. We were, however, able to hold our ground without difficulty, and did so till about 8 p.m., when, to avoid being flanked, I retired my command in good order, not under fire.

About 10 p.m. the enemy sent about 300 mounted men toward westville, and attacked, with double the strength of my regiment,the line I had formed,but were repulsed; when,finding that the rebels were sending a heavy column to our left, I found it necessary to again retire,which was done in good order. The main force I sent into Somerville,and held the forks of the road 4 1/2 miles north of Somerville. The command arrived in Somerville about 5 a.m.having fought over four hours the preceding twenty-four hours,and having marched over rough roads a distance of 40 or more miles.

It is be remarked that Company C, detachments A, F, and M, were only able to join me after the fight. C detachment came in about 11 p.m., having carried dispatches to the general commanding division at La Grange. I remained in Somerville December 25, fed, rested, inspected, and cleaned arms, scouted west, north, and east to New Castle, and received orders about 12.30 a.m., December 26, to immediately move east to New Castle; that Major Burgh was at that point with 300 men and 12-pounder howitzers. I received, also, word from Major Burgh that he was that point. I immediately dispatched Major Burgh to remain at New Castle, unless he was forced back, and informed him that I would move east and join him; further directing him to send a scouting party toward Whiteville. At 3,30 a.m. I marched from Somerville, taking the New Castle, road and met the enemy about 4 miles from New Castle. We immediately formed, and pushed by hard fighting, both on foot and mounted, to about 1 1/2 miles from where Major Burgh was resting in line of battle.

I then dispatched messages, two in writing, to General Grierson, stating that I was fighting the enemy and where, and further stating that Major Burgh was not co-operating, and hence had probably been forces to retire. I have since learned that no written messages had come through.

The fight commenced about 9 a.m. and lasted till 12.30, when, the
