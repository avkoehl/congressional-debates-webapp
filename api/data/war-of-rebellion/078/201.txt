STRAWBERRY PLAINS, July 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General TILLSON:

By courier from Jonesborough I have been informed that Morgan had issued orders to his command about the country to meet him on the 30th this month at Waynesville, N. C., and that he (Morgan) would go down through North Carolina and burn the Loudon bridge, and that it would take from three to six days to get there. I send the message as it came to me for what it is worth.

MEMPHIS, July 23, 1864.

(Received near Atlanta 25th.)

Major-General SHERMAN:

Yours of the 20th received. General Smith has returned. He thinks you have a wrong impression in regard to his fight. He returned for lack of supplies. That he whipped the enemy very badly there is no doubt. I have ordered General Smith to put his command in order to again move against Forrest. He will so move as soon as he can get ready, unless you should think he had better go to Mobile.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
