[CHAP. XLIII.

advise him that it would be prudent to remove any non-combatants who might be still in Chattanooga. No reply has been returned, but, the combatants having been removed from this vicinity, it is probable that the non-combatants can remain without imprudence.

May I suggest that your visit to Louisville, with the measures there inaugurated, have done the cause in this quarter much good. It would be well to visit us here, and also for the President to review an army which has done so much for the country and which has not yet seen his face.
