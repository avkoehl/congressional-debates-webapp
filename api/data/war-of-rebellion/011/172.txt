BUELL'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I am not advancing to-day, but am working roads to my front, rear, and left. I am now in line in rear of Chambers Creek. Stanley on the left of the main Corinth, with my outposts and vedettes, within a half a mile of the enemy and 4 1/2 miles of Corinth. I have thrown Nelson off to the left to support Pope's reconnaissance, in accordance with your instructions. The ground everywhere is intersected by creeks and marshy bottoms, over which corduroy roads have to be made, forming perfect defiles.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

BUELL'S [HEADQUARTER],

May 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I have been out all day, and only now received your dispatch. I find that Pope is reconnoitering with his whole force, 20,000 men, and has to march 7 miles. I will endeavor to cover his retreat if he should come to that, but it is proper to inform you that in doing so I must move some 3 miles to the left, and thus expose my camp and my right flank.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

NEAR FARMINGTON,

May 8, 1862.

General HALLECK:

Deserter just in that left enemy's lines about daylight, near Farmington. He says they are expecting attack on their right, and have over 100,000 men at Corinth, receiving re-enforcements daily, and there is no intention of leaving, but will make a defense. Pope will be ready to move in about thirty minutes and reach their lines about noon. Have column ready for his support, if needed. I will advise you frequently from the field. We are extending telegraph to Farmington.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

FARMINGTON, May 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Slight skirmishing all afternoon. Our forces have pressed forward, and are now within 1 mile of enemy's works. Heavy cavalry and infantry force on the left, beyond the railroad. The woods appear to be full of rebels; they will not fight much outside of their works. A steady artillery fire in front for the past twenty minutes and still continues.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.
