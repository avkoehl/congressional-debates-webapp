NOTE. -The supply trains of infantry are supposed to carry, each wagon, 1,800 pounds subsistence, equal to 1,200 short rations and 600 pounds grain; each wagon of cavalry supply train, 1,500 pounds subsistence and 600 pounds grain. The loads of all other wagons will exceed 2,000 pounds. This memoranda does not include the army headquarters, provost-marshal-general's department, Engineer Brigade, nor the repair depot, all of which now have about 434 wagons.

At these headquarters there are 110 wagons, twenty-five for officers' baggage, mess stores, office property, and papers (generally over 50 officers on duty here); twenty-five wagons for subsistence; the balance for forage to feed about 800 animals, and for extra clothing and quartermaster's stores generally.

The provost-marshal-general has a train of forty-seven wagons for baggage, subsistence, forage, &c. He has several regiments on duty with him, and frequently has many prisoners.

Those at the repair depot and part of those at these headquarters are loaded for general use on marches, mostly with forage.

My last report shows about 3,600 wagons on hand in the army. The infantry corps average now about 760 wagons each.

If existing orders be so modified as to allow five wagons to each 1,00 men for small-arm ammunition, eight and one-half for supply train for subsistence, and only two to each regiment for baggage, mess stores, 7c., the means of transportation now on hand will answer to carry ten day's subsistence and forage in wagons.

In the Second Corps, for instance, one wagon is allowed to the field and staff and one to the line officers of each regiment for the purpose of transporting baggage, camp equipage, desks, papers, and mess stores. The balance of the regimental wagons are loaded with three day's rations of subsistence, quartermaster's stores, and forage, and the average weight of each load is from 2,800 to 3,000 pounds.

That is calculating pork for twice in seven days. The other meat will be driven on the hoof.
