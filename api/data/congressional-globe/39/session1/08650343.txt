all cases where property liable to distraint for
taxes may not be divisible, so as to enable the

whole amount of the tax, with all costs, charges,
and commissions, the whole of such property
shall be sold, and the surplus of the proceeds
of the sale, after satisfying the tax, costs, and
charges, shall be paid to the person legally en-
titled to receive the same : or if he cannot be
found, or refuse lo receive the same, then men
surplus shall be deposited in the Treasury of
the United States, to be there held for the use
of the person legally entitled to receive the
same, until he shall make application therefor
to the Secretary of the Treasury, who, upon
such application and satisfactory proofs in sup-
port thereof, shall, by warrant on the Treasury,
cause the same to be paid to the applicant.
And if any of the property advertised for sale
as aforesaid is of a kind subject to tax, and
such tax has not been paid, and the amount
bid for such property is not equal to the amount
of such tax, the collector may purchase the
same in behalf of the United States for an
amount not exceeding the said tax. And in all
cases where property subject to tax, but upon
which the tax has not been paid, shall be seized
upon distraint and sold, the amount of such
tax shall, after deducting the expenses of such
sale, be first appropriated out of the proceeds
thereof to the payment of said tax. And if
no assessment of tax has been made upon such
property, the collector shall make a return
thereof in the form required by law, and the
assessor shall assess the tax thereon. Arnd all

lector, under such regulations as may be pre-
scribed by the Commissioner of Internal Reve-
nue. And the collector shall render a distinct
account of all charges incurred in the sale of

sary expenses for making such distraint or seiz-
ure have boon incurred, and in ease of sale, the
said collector shall pay into the Treasury the
surplus, if any there be, after defraying such
fees and charges.
That section thirty be amended by striking
out all after the enacting clause and inserting
in lieu thereof the following : that in any case
where goods, chattels, or effects sufficient to
satisfy the taxes imposed by law upon any per-
son liable to pay the same shall not be found
by the collector or deputy collector whose duty
it may be to collect the same, he is hereby
authorized to collect the same by seizure and
sale of real estate; and the officer making such
seizure and sale shall give notice to the pet son
whose estate is proposed to be sold, by giving
him in hand, or leaving at his last or usual place
of abode, if he has any such within the collec-
tion district where said estate is situated, a no-
