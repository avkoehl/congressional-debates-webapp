PETERSBURG, May 11, 1864.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond, Va.:

I have not yet left here, my preenece being still absolutely ncessary. Will leave immediately after arrival of two last brigades- hourly expected from Weldon. General Hoke leads advance with six brigades and eight batteries. He commenced moving this morning to clear his front of enemy and from jucntion with Major-General Ransom, but having been informed after movement hd been ordered that enemy had retired to Bermuda Hundred, I rodered GeenrL hoke to make forced reconnaissance in that idrection to ascertain fact and press on enemy if he were re- emaabarking, when I would join him and assume command if necessary. About noon to- day the spirit of this order was objected to be Secretary of War, and consequently outermanded by me. An immediate jucnitonwith Ransom was ordered, but two hours aftetward the order to make forced recnnaissance was approved by General Bragg, and is now being executed. Please see plan of this movement. Enemy is now constructing works on northside of Appomattox at Cobb's, and occupying threatening atitude in that direction. Please inform me if my course is approved by you.

Your telegram of 12. 20 am. m. has just been received. necessary orders will be given. Make the diversion ordered by you but it may fail for want of proper organization. If enemy should make a strong resistance would it not be preferable to complete the organization given oin cipher, now repeated, a ndthen make a crushing attack on enemy!

Please answer.
