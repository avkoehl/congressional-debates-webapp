out of the Erlanger loan was pounds 544,976. Mr. McRae asked that warrants to cover this advance be at once sent to him in order that he might adjust the accounts of the loan between the War and Treasury Departments. Warrants to the extent of pounds 311,000 were accordingly sent to him and he was advised (November 30, 1863) that no more could be done just then, as the appropriations on this side could not stand any further draft upon them without embarrassing the operations of the bureaus. Other warrants were promised him as soon as our appropriations should be made by Congress, then so soon to assemble. This, however, has not been done.

In addition to the above advance of pounds 544,976 it was understood (see your letter of September 26 to Mr. McRae) that pounds 262,500 were yet to accrue to the War Department out of the Erlanger loan. After consultation with the chief of the several bureaus this amount was apportioned out by you (see your letter of October, 1863, to Mr. McRae) as follows:

Quartermaster's Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Pounds 85,000

Ordnance Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55,500

Commissary Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40,000

Medical Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30,000

Niter and Mining Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40,000

Engineer Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,000

Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 262,500

It would now seem, however, that these pounds 262,500 were predicated upon the further negotiation of bonds by Messrs. Erlanger &amp; Co. Said negotiation having failed, the funds are not in the hands of Mr. McRae to meet the warrants sent forward by the various bureaus under the apportionment.

As, however, a deficit of pounds 233,000 of the advance of pounds 544,976 was yet uncovered by warrants, the actual overdraft of the War Department on its proportion of the Erlanger loan is something less than pounds 29,000. But it is to be considered that while the amount actually advanced for the War Department is covered by drafts, such drafts are in favor of bureaus not properly chargeable expended.

It appears, further, that under authority from the Quartermaster-General, approved by you, Major Waller, quartermaster at Nassau, had drawn on Mr. McRae for pounds 20,000 at sixty and ninety. Mr. McRae has no funds in hand, but has accepted the drafts, hoping that he may be placed in funds before their maturity with which to duly protect them. These drafts are held by outside parties, but the warrants in favor of bureaus (above referred to) are in the hands of officers and agents of the Government.
