I think that either Harrisonville, Austin, or Dayton would be a much better place for I and L Squadrons than Johnstown. Independence will not be safe with one squadron.

JAMES H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., May 18, 1864-5.40 p. m.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Pleasant Hill, Mo.:

There should be at all times a scout from Pleasant Hill in the vicinity of Harrisonville. No necessity for any one leaving the place, as this will afford ample protection. What reason is there to believe, with the country well scouted, Independence cannot be held by the people, assisted by one company of cavalry?
