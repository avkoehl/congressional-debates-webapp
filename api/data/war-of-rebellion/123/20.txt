was based upon the estimate that their number would not exceed 500,000. The number of volunteers in the service is believed to be nearly 700,000. By reason of this increased force the whole appropriation for the payment of volunteers will be exhausted by the 30th of this month, and provision should be made to meet the payments until the 30th of June. Upon the report of the Paymaster-General, I recommend that an appropriation of $30,000,000 be made for that purpose. An additional appropriation of $100,000 will also be required to carry into effect the act passed 25th of March, 1862, to secure pay, bounty, and pensions to officers and men actually employed in the Western Department or Department of the Missouri.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient-servant,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
