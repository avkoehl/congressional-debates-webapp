take the one that had been printed and laid on their
tables—-he believed it came fromthe Senate—and if
the rules were suspended, ho would so modify it
Upon further examination, however, M W found
that it inateiially differed Irotn the object they both
seemed to have in view, and he, theiefore, notified
the gentlemin fiom Indiana that he should notofftr
it, adding further that,-as his great object was to do
awaj with all distinctions now existing in the kind
of moneys received for the public dues, he was de-
sirous of doing every thing in his power to accom-
modate all sides of the House He was willing to
make it a joint -evolution, and he then s>aid, and
again pledged himseif, that, if the rules weie sus-
pended, he would iratne the resolution, at the sug-
gestion of any gentleman, to aceomplibh the object
of those who uanted to see the specie circu.ar
repealed He would mike any modificat on that
would be thought geneially acceptable to the
House
Mr W explained the reason why he had not
called up bis resolution before, that he thought they
got along much better by taking up the business in
its regulai order, besides his resolution was submit-
ted only a day 01 two before the duelling repoit
came m, and, as a privileged question, that cut
off eveiy thing else, and took up two or three
■weeks, ind moreover he wis not disposed to an est
the public businc-s o£ ihe House Mr W then
sent his modification to tneChair, which Was read,
and he moved the House to take it up
Objection being made, Mr W moved a suspen-
sion of the rule, and asked foi the yeas and nays,
■which were ordeied
Mr BOON then asked leave to make a iurthcr
siatement, but it w?s objected to.
The question was then taken on suspending the
rules, and decided in the negative—yeas 104,

So the House refused
Mi NAYLOR, on leave, presented a petition
Mi HUNTKK, of Ohio, rrovtd to prut
Ihe repoit of the survey of the harbor of Sandusk),
in that Stale, which was sent m Irora the Topogra-
phical Bureau ypsteidaj, and the motion «as
agreed to r>em dm
Mr WHIJTTLESEY, oí Ohio, from the Com-
mittee on Claims, lepui'ed a bill for the reliet of
---------Keller
Ais i, d bill to continue in foice ihe act of 1837,
to ,iiovule for the payment of hordes and other pio-
p<r \, lost, or deslioj eJ, 11 the mihtaiy service of
th  United States
Mi W moved thatit be made the order for this
da\, which v\as agreed to, and the House went
mslantei into committee ihereon, Mi REED in
the chair
Mr WHITTLESEY having briefly explained
its piovisions and the necessity ot us passage
Mr GRAHAM complained that the bill did
not extend far enough, and that as meritoriou. a
class of claimants were excluded from its benefits
as that embraced m its provisions    Mr G then
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBJá.
moved an amendment, extending the benefits ol the
bill to the mounted rangers of Indiana and Illinois.
Mr WHITTLESEY said, if it was intended to
press this amendment, he should be compelled to
move the rising of the committee, s,o as to discuss
it another time, because the House agreed to go
into committee, merely to consider the original bill
as reported. Moieover, Mr W was prepared to
make a report on the subject referred to by Mr
Gruum, m respons to a resolution intioducsd
some time since by that gentleman
Mr   "iELL suggested to the gentleman fiom
Indiana,   as there were   other  States interested,
eithei to make his pioposed provision general, or at
least to mcluds Alkansas     It he did neither, Mi
Y should \ote against the adniendmenl.
Mr GRAHAM assented to the first buggesuon,
and made his amendment general, so as to include
all mounted i angers. Mr G then entered into the
details, and set forth the sei vices and claims of this
class of men upon the Government
Mr WHITTLESEY appealed to the gentleman
to permit the question to be taken, or suffer the
committtee to rise, for if he had thought a long de-
bate was to have spiung up, he most assuiedly
would not have asked the indulgence of the House
to go into committee upon this bill
Mi GRAHAM, however, d; clined lo v leld, and
went nti to advocate his amendment, and then be-
tore the quesnon was taken,
Mr HOFFMAN moved that the committee
rise, which being agreed lo, the committee lose,
reported progress, and had leave lo sit again
The SPEAKER then laid before the House the
following message, received from the Presideut of
the Unfed States
To the House of Representatives of the  United States
The accompanying copy of a communication
addressed to the Secretary of War by the Cherokee
delegation is submitted to Congress., in older that
such measures may be adopted as are required to
carry into effect the benevolent intentions of the
Government towards the Cheiokee na'ion, and
which it is hoped will induce them to remove
peaceably and contentedlv to their new homes m

The message having been lead,
Mi OWENS called for the leading of ihe ac-
companying documents, which being done,
Mr BELL moved the reference of the whole lo
a Committee on Ihe Union, and that they be
printed
On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG, the House
passed to the orders of the dav
After some conversation between Mr EVE-
RETT and Mr CAMBRELENG, the latter of
whom slating that the above papers involved a
new question,
Mr GLASCOCK moved a vote of reconsidera-
tion, so as to refer them to the Committee on Indian
Affairs, and gave his reasons thereror
Mr HATiNES was in favor of the latter íe-
lerence.
Mr EVERETT advocated a leference to the
Committee of Wajs and Means
Mr HOWARD prefened the oiigmal reference
to the Committee on the Unun, inasmucn as the
subject was already before that bodv, on the
amendments to the b 11 to prevent and suppiess
Tndian hos ihties
Mr HOLSEY advocated the reference to the
Indian Committee, for he could not consent to
emba-rass the above bill by bringing on a protracted
discussion upon the validity of the Cherokee treaty
Mr II apprehended hostilities, and alluded to a
murder that hadalready taken place.
Mr REED insisted that the reference already
made was the proper one, and he moved to lay lae
motion to reconsider on the table
Mr OWENS expressed a hope that die gent'e-
man would not press that motion
Mr HOLSEY asked for the yeas and navs, but
they were not ordered, and the motion was re-
jected—ayes 65, noes G§
Mr BELL knew nothing to be gained by the
reference ot the subject to the Committee on Indian
Affairs, for there was not ihe slightest ground to
beLeve that that committee would bring in any
proposition. They would do nothing, but say
"hands off." He was sorry the murder had been
alluded to, for there were no facts to show that it
evinced a determination on the part of the Indians
to commence hostilities. As to voting money, Mr.
B was willing to vote all that -was now and would
be necessary, even to-day if it was thought expedi-
ent, but it would be useless to refer it to the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs?, as the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union must eventually
act upon it.
Mr. CAMBRELENG adverted to the imp  r-
tance of the President's communication, which con-
tained several distinct propositions, all of whu.h
cama widim the province oí the standing Commit-
tee on Indian Affairs to inquire info, and gave
other reasons for giving the subject lhat direction
Mr. CUSHING expressed himself willing to
yield the floor on the Northwest boundary question
to go on \iiih the Indian hostility bill
The motion to reconsider u as then agreed to—
ayes 73, noes 69.
The question then again recurring on the com-
mitment to the Committee of the Whole on ihe
state of the Union, it was decided in the negative,
by tellers-^-ayes 72, noes 84.
On sending it to the Committee on Indian At-
faus,
Mr. EVERETT moved to add the following in-
shuctions
"And that said committee nave power to send
for persons and papers."
Mr DAWSON assured all parlies that if the)
expected to make any thing politically out of this
question thej were very much mistaken Where
could be the netíessily, or what good could result
out of sending for persons and papers to investi-
gate the validity of a treaty long since ratified and
confirmed1 What1 vere they to sailer John Ross
to airest and change the whole action of this Go-
vernment Mr D. had labored day and night to
bring thu man to a leasonable proposition, but he
had no sooner succeeded than in a hour afterwards
he withdrew, or changed his opinion
Mr D said the only proper course for the Hous 
to puibue was to disobey and disregard the Presi-
dent's recommendations, which were in effect to
declaie war against *he people of Georgia He,
therefore, moved to lay the whole subject on the
table, but withdrew that motion at the request of
Mr. WISE, who hoped this cojjimumcation
would be considered, and said he would pay the
first compliment to the President he had ever paid
m his lite, for his propositions were a virtual ac-
knowledgm nt that the pretended treaty was no
treaty, as Mr W had often before alleged He
rejoiced that the Executive ot the United States
had at last signified a wish to do justice to the
Cherokees Mr. W puisuant to hr pledge to
Mr Dawson, renewed that gentleman's motion to
lay the whole subject on the table, but withdrew it
by his assent.
Mr GLASCOCK addressed the House with
earnestness, insisting on tin. obligation ol the tri_uiy
ot 1835, and the sacredness of the vested rights of
Georgia under it, the certaintj that her citis-enc
would take possession of these lands, and the im-
minent danger of an Indian war Should the Go-
vernment attempt to oveiturn that treaty, Georgia
would never be found wanting to heiself^as she
had once before proved And he would sav to the
gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wisu] that h
bold threats about castigating his State into suo-
mission, had no terror for him oi the people he in
part represented This was not the first time tha*
such threats had been mide against Georg.a, glow-
ing out ot the Indian treaties, but she flwajs too',
her stand, and assumed her position under them, an 1
was not to be lorced from it She ever remi li'd
firm, a^she will now, amidst all the calumnies
and foul slanders which have been eagerly circu-
lated lo her injury, and unaued by e er> attempt
of those who, under the sacred gaib of religion and
humanity, seek to array against her public feeling
and indignation
Sir, said Mr G , she plan's herself upon those
rights secured and guarantied to her under the
treaty of 1835—a treaty solemnly ratified, pnd
having all  the sanctions and requisites requn d
