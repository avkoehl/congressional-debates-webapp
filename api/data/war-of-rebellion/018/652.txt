FALMOUTH, August 24, 1862.

General MORELL:

If there is no large force at Kelly's Ford push on to Rappahannock Station. Sykes will follow, and the whole corps will move on to join Pope near Sulphur Springs, at which point he attacked and drove the enemy over the river. Give aid to the telegraph operators; cut poles for them, and push it along. The artillery is in motion. Graham and Smead join Sykes for the present.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 24 [23], 1862.

Major-General POPE,

Headquarters Army of Virginia:

The railroad train from Harper's Ferry to this place was fired into and burned this afternoon; the mail captured, and telegraph wire cut. A few soldiers coming here were taken. With what mounted force I can muster I am trying to intercept the marauders. This may be nothing more than a raid of bushwhackers or may indicate movements of the enemy down the valley. I give you the facts, whatever they are worth.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WINCHESTER, August 24, 1862-9 a.m.

Major-General POPE,

Headquarters Army of Virginia:

The railroad train from Harper's Ferry to this place was captured and burnt by a party of the Ashby Cavalry last evening and the telegraph cut. I have had the latter repaired. Workmen are clearing the track and repairing the road. What mounted men I can command are in pursuit of the enemy. This road is under the control of General Wool. I respectfully suggest that the Government property transported on it would be safer if a proper guard were on each train.

I sent this dispatch by way of Martinsburg last night, but repeat it for security.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WINCHESTER, VA., August 24, 1862-3 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I deem it my duty to inform you that a brisk cannonading, apparently in the direction of Warrenton, has been heard here four hours.

The railroad train from Harper's Ferry to this place was destroyed yesterday p.m. by the enemy, who burned the cars and took the mail, and the telegraph wire cut. The road is in process of repair. Telegraph line repaired and working. I have advised General Pope, but also notify you, as communication with may be impracticable.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
