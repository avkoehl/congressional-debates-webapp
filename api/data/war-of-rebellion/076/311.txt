HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 31, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I do not know of a better cavalry commander in my army than Garrard. He is an excellent administrative officer, and I have no doubt you will find on inquiry that his ordered from Stoneman were indefinite. Garrard is much more judicious than Kilpatrick, who can knock up his horses as rapidly as any man I know. U think if you will bear with Garrard you will find in a short time he will be the best cavalry commander you have.

Major-General.
HDQRS. 14TH ARMY CORPS, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 31, 1864-6 a. m.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General"

GENERAL: Brigadier-General Davis expressed to Mr. Shaw upon the delivery of the order of the major-general commanding the military division his inability to understand the method of the proposed reconnaissance. He says his division is in line, the enemy being in position about 1,200 yards to his front, and the division of Brigadier-General Ward in position on his right. If he advances it amounts to an assault upon the enemy's position. If he withdraws with a view to passing to General Ward's rear he leaves a gap. As this is the fourth order from the headquarters of the military division imposing special duties upon Davis' division away from his corps, I do not feel at liberty to interfere even by advice; but as he still nominally belongs to the Fourteenth Corps, hope I will be pardoned for acting in the matter so far as to communicate his difficulties and in asking from the proper authority such further and more precise instructions as it may be thought proper to give him.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 31, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

It is going to be terrifically hot, but I must ask you to meet me at 10 a. m. at General Wood's, with your maps and any notes of observations of the enemy's works between your left and General Stanley's center.

W. T. SHERMAN,

General SCHOFIELD:

I have news from General Garrard. He camped eighteen miles from here last night, on the Peach Tree road, and is coming toward Buck
