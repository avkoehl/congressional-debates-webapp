THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 18,
and men in Mexico under a decree of the
Emperor Maximilian.
Mr. CHANDLER. I ask for the passage
of the resolution. It is only a resolution of
inquiry. I presume there is^no objection to it;
Mr. ANTHONY. I believe that resolution
declares in the preamble that'more than ten
thousand Mexicans were killed  â€¢
Mr. CHANDLER. It simply says that is
the allegation.
Mr. SPRAGUE and others. Let the reso-
lution be road.

PEACE WITH INDIAN TItlBES.
Mr. HENDERSON. I move that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration 
Mr. SUMNER. Before the Senate proceeds
with his bill I hope the bill which came from
the House will be taken up. There is tf1 bill
on the table just received from the House. Let
us have it disposed of.
Mr. HENDERSON. This is a matter of
much more importance. 1 desire that the
Senate should consider it. We can pass this
bill in a few minutes now.
Mr. SUMNER. But there probably will be
debate.
Mr. HENDERSON. I move to take up
Senate bill No. 136, to establish peace with
certain hostile Indian tribes. I have been very
patient about this matter. I desire to get
through with the bill, so that it may go to the
other House.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, resumed the con-
sideration of the bill, (S. No. 136,) the pending
question being on the amendment offered by

ment be read again.
