THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 1,
I have in this statement taken the report of the
Secretary throughout as correct, but in relation to
one very important element he appears, from his
own tables, to be clearly wrong.
In statement B, the amount of avails of treasury
notes, &c., for the quarter ending 30th Septem-
ber, 1847, is, as often before stated, the sum of
$6,915,078; "redemption of treasury notes and
interest," on the other side of the same account,
is $2,385,329 63.
B.—Statement of duties, revenues, and public expenditures, for
the first quarter of the fiscal year from Ist of July to 30th
of September, 1847, agreeably to warrants issued, exclusive
of trust funds.

Now, Mr. Chairman, it is quite apparent that
in this sum are improperly placed such portion of
the treasury notes as were funded during this quar-
ter, and for which stock was issued, and equally
apparent that it should not he so placed. That it
is ao placed, is apparent by referring to schedule
M of the report, which is a statement of the
"reimbursement of treasury note3 monthly, from
December 1, 184G, to December 1, 1847."
It also appears, by a reference to table ICK, that
the full amount of treasury notes received during
the months embraced in that quarter was:
From the '-u-.toins   £37.500
And by table X, from Hie public lands ' l's.>0
M9,350
Showing that the whole amount paid in for duties
and lands was less than $40,000.
This also appears from the article in the "Union"
to which I have already referred, as follows:
" In the amount given in table 13 (namelv, $-2,385,339 631
appeui-to lie included trensuiy noies redeemed byconver-
sion into stocks, as wi'll as by receipt for public dues and
payments of money."
This mistake is the more remarkable, because,
in deducting the amount of redemption of treasury
notes in the previous fiscal year, he makes the
deduction of those which were funded, and only
places the balance as the amount which is to be
deducted, as reducing the avails of the portion of
the loan available during the year.
This was clearly correct, because, if treasury
notes for a given atpount are converted into a loan,
the debt thereby only assumes a permanent instead
of a temporary character; but the operation m no
way diminishes the avuils previously received for
the notes.
Correcting this small error of over two and a
quarter millions, the following is the result, as ap-
pears from the Secretary's report:

year endiiii,' June 30,1817

According to these statement- of Hie S"crc-
tary of the Treasury, tiie amount available
for the residue of the year would be  2.808,469 62
$33.000.009 1 0
In -view also of these corrections, let us see to
what result the Secretary is reduced:
Avails of treasury notes and
loans, as above §25,679.169 45
Deduet redeemed  3,361,397 07
 $23,317,70S 38

 1—. 6,875,758 00
Estimated avails of treasuiy notes and loans <i,2S5.294 55
&3-j .478.724 93
Thi« amount will be varied only by the sum
which may have been paid in during the quarter
for other debts due the Government, aside from the
customs and public lands, which must be very
trifling.
It thus appears that the Secretary, with what he
has already received from the thirty-three millions
of treasury notes, and what he estimates for the
future, calculates upon about three and a half mil-
lions more than the whole amount. The history
of these errors is somewhat remarkable.
J. The depaitment, on the 19th January, say
that they had omitted, by mistake, a statement of
the actual receipts from tieasury notes for the first
quarter of tins fiscal year, $6,915,078.
2. By the report of the Sec
in the other. If the Secretary does not know the
amount of debt paid in the time named, he should
give place to some one who can find it out.
In view of these facts, it may lie useful to pause
and examine for a moment the financial labors of
the head of the Treasury Department. During the
last session of Congress he estimates the amount
required to meet all the expenses of the Govern-
ment to the 30th of June, 1848, and asks for a loan
I to meet the deficiency. All that he asks is granted;
1 but before one-half of the year is passed, he
|j informs Congress that his calculations were all
! wrong, and that an additional loan would be re-
j quired ofabout eighteen and a half millions of dol-
11 Jars to meet the expenses of the Government to that
[; time. This communication is made to Congress
'l on the 9th of December; but by the time that the
j communication is printed in full, on the 19th of
January, he informs Congress, through the Chief
! Clerk, that he had made the gross eiror of more
i than six millions nine hundied thousand dollars,
and that his receipts had been that much more
|| than he was aware of when he made his report,
j| and that the amount of the loan might be dimin-
ished to that extent. There is much parade of the
j mistake of a clerk in preparing statements, and
:• very unnecessary trouble is expended in showing
|i I1010 this error occurred. It is far more remarkable
that any man should ever be at the head of the
i-ftary, deducting the
receipts from the expenditures, it appears that the
mistake in under-estimating the excess of expend- i Jr"u m?n sllmilcl ever be at 'he head of tl
itures is about $1,132,000. |! 1 rea&iL!1T that could, by any possibility, make a
mistake in stating his resources at nearly seven
millions of dollars short of the true amount. What
kind of knowledge' must he have of the finances of
the country, if lie can lose this sum without know-
ing it, or, which is the same thing, in the formal
annual official communication to Congress, make
a statement of the actual receipts into the treasury
set en millions short of the amount. The error is
3. By the explanatory statement of the Register
of the Ti easury, it appears that this excess is about
$1,500.000.
4. By correcting the apparent error in statement
in table B of the redemption of tieasury notes, the
error in relation to treasury notea is shown to be
abon ti,3,500,000
There is another most serious and acknowledged
error, to which 1 wish to call the attention of the
House. It is in relation to the amount of public
debt paid duringeertain periods. Statement E, in
the report of the Secretary, is headed, " Statement
of the amount of the public debt paid fiom 1st
December, I84f>, to 1st December, 1847," and the
amount is }',9,04b,511 35; and below, and connect-
ed with it, " Statement of the amount of interest on
the public debt, fiom 1st December, 1840, to 1st :
December 1847." The amount of this is $1,433,-
850 29; being together the sum of ^10,460,362 14.
Thus showing the amount of debt and interest
paid during the twelve months ending 1st Decem-
ber, 1847.
Table Q, in the same report, is headed as follows:
" Table of payments made annually on account of
the interest and principal of public debt, from the
4th March, ;789, to the 1st December, 1847."
Fiom this it appears that the total amount of pay-
ments of public debt and inteiest from the 1st July,
1846, to 1st December, 1847, seventeen months,
and embracing the same months as in table E
is $9,261 250 08; that is, that the amount paid for
seventeen months is $1,219,103 0B less than the
other table shows to have been paid for a part of
the time.
It will be perceived that the object of both these
tables was only different in this respect, that the
first gave the payments for one year, and the other
for a seues of years; and yet, this enormous dis-
crepancy!
The " Union," in the article referred to above,
acknowledges this error as follows:
" Looking thiough the tables appended to the report, we
find two others, which may require explanation. Table E,
on page 43, contains it statement oi the amount ot public debt
paid tiom IWembei l, ls-46, to Dtcembei 1,1847, amount-
ing, principal rind interest, to $10,4^0.362 10 Table Q, on
page 67, contains, a statement ol the pavments made annu-
ally on account of the principal and interest of the public ;
debt, from the 4th of M.uch, 3 789, to the 1st of December, i
1847. Heie weiind that the payment-on the-e account-, from i
July 1,1810. to June 30, 1847, amounted to ,<6.720,0 5J 39 •
and from June 30 to Decembei 1. lfc'47, to $2,539,237 6°— 1
together, ,^9.2ol,259 08. ' ^ 5 ' • j
"How is this? According to table E, the payments on '
account of the public debt amounted, m twelve months to
nearly ten million* ai,d a half; while, according to table Q,,
the pajmentson the same account amounted, m seventeen
months, to litlle more than nine millions and a quarter*
while in thc.<-e seventeen months are included the verv
twelve mouths tliar are embraced in table F,  
embraced in table E.:
This attempted explanation is too long to be
inserted. Indeed it is no explanation at all, but
only amounts to a statement that the trouble arises
from the confused mode of keeping the accounts
at the treasury. This is 110 apology whatever for
these two conflicting statements in the same report
for the same materials were on hand in one case as
one which shows an utter lgnorsnee of the affairs
of the department and the state of the finances of
the coui'try which is truly alarming.
! In order, however, to show the incompetency
of the bead of this department more strikingly, is
| now appeals that his oiiginal mistake was not as
' g'eat as he supposed it was ; and m his eoneciion
| of the former blunder, he has made another of a
; very serious amount.
Mr. Chairman, a most serious question arises ;
j What confidence have we in the safety of the
j funds of the Government? I mean not to charge
, any dishonesty upon the head of that department;
tar from it. But where is the check upon the
large number of persons through whose hands, iu
■ one form or another, the money, and treasury
notes, and stock certificates pass.' What is the
system of accountability? Does the Secretary
I mean to issue, in violation of l.aw, the amount of
, treasury notes which he says will be available
j during the present fiscal year? How many mil-
j lions of treasury notes must be lost or stolen in
i order to enable the Secretary to discover the loss ?
I Why does not the public voice indignantly de-
1 mand that these matters should be explained, and
that the dreaming philosopher at the head of the
Treasury, with all his schemes, notions of free
1 trade, and his laborious trifling, should give up
his post to a^erson having some practical skill in
i the aftairs of life—some knowledge of the finances
of the country? The reason doubtless is, that
the millions upon millions which are squtftidered,
worse than thrown away in this miserable war
11 with Mexico, renders the public, quite indifferent
ji to minor matters. The repeated and successive
j; blunders and counter-blunders of millions of dol-
j Jars, which would, in any other period of our
history, have thrust any Secretary from office
; coveied him with disgrace, and made him the
: reproach and by-word of the whole land, is justly
considered as only one of the minor enormities of
tms Administration. This horrible war wi'h Mex-
! ICO. and, most of all, the nefarious and heathenish
! principles openly avowed by men occupying re-
: sponsible stations in the Government—the publicly
i setting at naught the eternal and unchangeable
principles of justice, of right, and of truth, and the
! f,011'™1 of,a superintending Providence, the law of
| the Almighty Ruler of the Universe, and worship-
i P1"?." destiny"■—relying upon superior power, in-
dulging in an unholy thirst for empire—these things
| may well, as they do, occupy the public mind, and
the extiemest confusion and disorder, if nothing
worse, in the finances, may well be considered
as of minor consequence.
It may be amusing to inquire what has occupied
