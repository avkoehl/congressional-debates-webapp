HEADQUARTERS POLK'S CORPS,September 18, 1863-8.40 a. m.

GENERAL: Robertson's Reserve Artillery was ordered to report to me at La Fayette, and I ordered it to report to General Hindman for the march. General Anderson (commanding Hindman's division) states that he ordered copy of marching orders of that division to be has not joined him and has not been found, although two couriers have been dispatched for him. The general commanding having subsequently informed me that he was not placed under my orders, but was only to march in company with my column, I thought it possible that other orders may have been given him from army headquarters. Please inform me. In the meantime I shall make further search for him and order him to follow General Cheatham's column.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General MACKALL, Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. POLK'S CORPS, ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Anderson's House, Two Miles from Gordon's Mills,

September 18, 1863-12.30 p. m.

GENERAL: This column found the enemy in some force (not large) a short distance beyond this point. I am now engaged in deploying my troops and posting my batteries with a view of pressing him. A few of my batteries have already opened. A citizen from the other side of the river this morning reports the presence of five generals (Crittenden, Wood, Van Cleve, Palmer, and a Dutchman, whose name was not remembered). A staff officer this morning reports the enemy's column moving down Chickamauga on the other side in quiet line.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS POLK'S CORPS, ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Anderson's House, September 18, 1863-5.40 p. m.

GENERAL: I have pressed down to a point immediately opposite Gordon's Mills, and find the hills on the other side occupied strongly with infantry and batteries. The ground on the other side is high and commanding, and covered with wood. That on this side is low, and consists of open fields. As Buckner and Cheatham are in possession of Hunt's and Thedford's Fords, within a short distance below, and I have a good road into their line of march, I shall continue to threaten this position and shall pass over below. I am just advised by one of my staff officers that the column above me was in the act of crossing as he left it.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General MACKALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
