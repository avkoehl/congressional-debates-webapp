You seii that Hi'e black list runs us high m
fin rubers us two hundred and eighiy-live and a
half. No wonder that Democratic Newspa-
pers andppeakors ot that day paraded this list
arid talked about the people being taxed from
the cradle to the grave. It was u-ue, and the
-appKai of eloquent gembrtien on ttie other
side was unheeded ouly because we had just
Emerged from the war with a country saved ns
lire, innl mem breathed IVi'Ct ill the convic-
tion that t.ht: immediate dtuign' lu tlio litis of
tin; Republic bad pasHw], mid lor the moment
h'fnsed to Coilsidev \Hml il Cost. But as soon
as ;neu begun U> look nbout <m<l rouko,ti the.
weight bt tlio load upon their shoulders it,
became evident ihat wo could not long go on
at the ex'iHting rate ol' taxation.
Mr. Bjiteakiii'i the responsibility of reducing
Or keying It(> ttie filW of tili'ation vested then
upon the Kopublicnn party. 1 do not seek to
avoid that ismus. As a party tha responsibility
Was upuu us; for we had two thiids of each
branch bf Congresn, and could adjust taxation
to suit oivrselveH. We could pass any tax bill
Over thfe veto of President Johnson.
The dbilfe'etion of the revenue when once
Imposed was quite another thing. That we had
very little aa a pttHy to do With. Mr. Johnson
spceiliiy freiit into opposition to the Republi-
can party, took his conlidantsaud advisers Irom
those who were outside ot its ranks, and put
into office whenever it was in his power men
in no way representing its policy or principles.
Now, I wish to shovr^ in as biief space of
time as may ha practicable, what the Repub-
lican party has done in the way of reducing
this internal revenue tax. 1. will have read
the following table, showing the amount of the
different, reductions and the dates of the acts
providing for them, with a note irom the Com-
missioner of Internal Revenue showing gen-
erally Mow the reduction applied.

"The reduction under act of July 13, 1866, was
effected chiefly by the repeal of the extra duty of
twenty per cent, imposed on manufactures by sec-
tion five, act of March 3, 1865, and by additions to
the free list; under act of March 2. 1867, by raisins
the exemption on income from $600 to $1,000, and
establishing a uniform rate of five per cent, in placd
bf the differential rates of five and ten per cent.
The list of exemptions was also still further in-
creased, and the rate of tax in sbme instances
reduced. The act of February 3,1868, repealed the
duty on raw cotton. By act of March 31,1868, the
tax was repealed on all manufactures then taxable,
enumerated in section ninety-four, act of Juno 30,
1864, except gas. The act of July 14,1870, repealed
the tax on gross receipts, sales other than sales paid
by st&mps, and sales of tobacco, spirits, and winks,
legacies, successions, articles in schedule A, pass-
ports, and special taxes, Except those relating to
spirit^ tobacco, and fermented liquors. Tho ex-
emption on incomo Was raised from $1,000 to $2,000,
and th6 rate reduced from five to two and a half per
cent. The number of articles on the schedule has
thus been reduced from nearly three hundred under
the act of March 3,1865, to less than sixty under act
of July 14,1870."
The act of July 14,1870, also provided for a
reduction in the tariff amounting to $30,000,-
000, making in all a reduction in annual tax-
fitioh of $258,000,000. Who will dare say that
the people have not been relieved as fast as
prudence would permit. I will show here by
way of illustrating this relief the shrunken list

nue tax:

And this Congress has followed steadily in
the same direction. The tax and tariff bill,
as sent by this House to the Senate and
amended by that body, still further reduces
annual taxation more than fifty million dol-
lars. So that when it shall take effect the
aggregate reduction of annual taxation will
exceed three hundred million dollars. And
yet our Democratic friends would have the
people believe that the Republican party has
been false to its trust and has neglected the
people's interests.
All this has been done in the seven years
that have passed since the war, wlnle the
doniinartt party has borne other responsibili-
ties that would have crushed any other polit-
ical organization that ever existed. It has
completed tile work of reconstruction. It has
passed, one after the other, as the need arose,
the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth arti-
cles of the amendments to the Constitution,
confirming all that we had gained by putting
down the rebellion, and establishing it that in
this regard no backward stops should ever be
taken. It has done all this alone, not only un-
assisted by the Democratic party, but always
opposed and resisted in CougresS at every
step by i hat party. As it may be good reading
lor my Democratic friends, who profess so
much Syhipathy with the overburdened, over-
taxed people, 1 will give the vote in this House
on the tax and tariff bill of 1870, which struck
off $80,000,000 of amiual taxation: yeas 144,
all but eight Kepuklicans; nays 49, all Demo-
crats.
I have not time to spfcak of the improve-
ments made in the excise or internal revenue
