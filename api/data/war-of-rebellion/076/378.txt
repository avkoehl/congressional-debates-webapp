(Received 7.20 a. m.)

General SCHOFIELD:

I want to hear more noise on your flank. If General Palmer will not go into action, and General Jeff. Davis be present, turn over the orders to him, but time is precious, and that attack must be pushed to-day all the time.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,August 5, 1864--7.25 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Palmer has this moment informed me of your refusal to relieve him, and his final decision to go on the field and carry out my orders. He is now starting. I have been trying nearly all night to get things in working shape, but with very little progress. I hope now to get started. Johnson reached the Sandtown road last night, and Morgan's skirmishers are on it this morning. He reports strong resistance. I will do all in my power to press the attack. Davis is not here, and if he were, Johnson is his senior.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

General SCHOFIELD:

Dispatch received. All right. Press that attack on the right. I will judge by the sound, and if I judge you are too hard pressed will order Generals Thomas and Howard to assault somewhere. Get some part of your command where you can reach easily the railroad with short-range guns, and then intrench a strong flank. It is worth a battle, and the closer the first advantages are followed up the better. The weakest point of the enemy must be mathematically at some point between Atlanta and East Point. Keep me often advised of progress, and I will come over any minute you say, but can better handle the whole army from here by the telegraph.

General SCHOFIELD:

Now is the time for you to push. General Thomas is hard at work well on the other flank.

Major-General, Commanding.
