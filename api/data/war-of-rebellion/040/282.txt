to that point. Both Maryland regiments are ordered to proceed to that place this morning.

Mr. Diffy reports the enemy gone west. No damage done, except the burning of the Youghiogheny Bridge.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

Grafton, Va.:

I was glad to know by your dispatch to General Kelley last night that you had reached Grafton.

I have from Pittsburg and Harrisburg reports this morning that the rebels were in possession of Morgantown last night. I wait anxiously to hear from you. Is it so? If true, it can be in no considerable force. Can you not get in the rear and cut them off? I have troops at Oakland and pushing on to Rowlesburg; all the works at Rowlesburg and Cheat River are still safe. Major Showalter has defended that point admirably. Endeavor by all means to open communication with Rowlesburg.

My greatest concern about the railroad now is for Kingwood tunnel. The entire force of the enemy on the line, I am satisfied, does not exceed 1,500-all cavalry.

Have you anything from Roberts?

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

New Creek:

Following just received from Colonel Mulligan, at Grafton:

The rebel force at Morgantown, about 700 or 800, intended to destroy the Fairmont Bridge. I have put it beyond damage. My advance has been pushing for Rowlesburg since morning. I will be in there early to-morrow.

General Roberts has just arrived at Clarksburg. He will quiet this region within the next forty-eight hours.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

CLARKSBURG, VA.,

April 28, 1863.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

Grafton, Va.:

The enemy is advancing on Webster, and the stores there will be destroyed. You must defend yourself at Grafton, and aid at Fairmont, if possible.

Take care that rolling-stock does not fall into the hands of the enemy, or subsistence of any kind.

B. S. ROBERTS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
