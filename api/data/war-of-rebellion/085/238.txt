PINE BLUFF, ARK., September 18, 1864.

Major-General STEELE:

My scouts have just returned from the vicinity of Monticello and Mount Elba. They bring the following information: Walker's division of infantry is at Monticello; also Parsons' division (three brigades) of cavalry. All of the infantry from Camden and Princeton are at Warren. Fagan's command is also at Monticello. A force of cavalry is at Mount Elba; probably a detachment from the cavalry at Monticello. This information they give as entirely reliable.

SIR: I have ordered the Twelfth Kansas Infantry to march as rapidly as possible for Fort Gibson. Send forward as many troops as you can possibly spare to re-enforce the train, or be within supporting distance of it. Make Gibson as strong as possible by throwing up rifle-pits and barricades. Send messengers to me often. Your dispatch of yesterday evening has just reached me.
