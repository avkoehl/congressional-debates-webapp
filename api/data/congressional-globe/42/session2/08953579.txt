extension of kej klux act.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 656) to
extend the provisions of the fourth section of
the act approved April 20, 1871.
Mr. SCOTT. I ask that the bill be read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Be it enacted, &c.t That the provisions of the
fourth section of the act approved April 20, 1871,
entitled " An act to enforce the provisions of the
fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of tbo
United States, and for other purposes," shall con-
tinue in force until the end of the next regular ses-
sion of Congress.
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, this bill pro-
poses to continue in force until the end of the
next regular session of Congress the provis-
ions of the fourth section of the act of April
20, 1871, which I ask the Secretary to read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
A, whenever in any State or part of a
State the unlawful combinations named in the pre-
ceding seotion of this act shall be organized and
armed, and so numerous and powerful as to be able,
by violence, to either overthrow or set at defiance
tne constituted authorities of such State, and of the
United Statos within suchState, or when the consti-
tuted authorities are m complicity with or shall
connive at the unlawful purposes of, such powerful
ana armed combinations; and whenever by reason
ot either or all of th,e causes aforesaid, the convic-
tion ot such offenders and the preservation of tho
public gaiety shall beoomo in such district impracti-
cable, 111 every such caso suoh combinations shall bo
tleemod a rebellion against the Government of tho
United States, and during the continuance of such
rebellion, and within the limits of the district which
shall bo so under the sway thereof, such limits to bo
proscribed by proclamation, it shall bo lawful for tho
President of theUnited States, when in bis judgment
tho public safety shall require it, to suspend the
privileges of the writ of habeas corpw, to the end
that suoh robollion. may be overthrown: Provided,
lhat all the( provisions of the second section of an
act entitled, 'An act relating to habeas corpus, and
regulating judicial proceedings in certain eases,"
approved March 3,1803, which rolateto the discharge
ot prisoners other than prisoners of war, and to tho
Penalty for refusing to obey the order of tho court,
snail be in full force so far as the same are applica-
ble to the provisions of this section: Provided further,
lhat the President shall first have mado proclama-
tion, as now provided by law, commanding such in-
surgents to disperse: And provided also, That the
provisions of this section shall not be in force after
the end of the next regular session of Congress."
^ Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President,1 these pro-
visions and the proposition to extend them
suggest the following inquiries :
First. Are there unlawful combinations or-
ganized and armed in any State or parts of any
State ?
Second. Are they so numerous and powerful
as to be able by violence to either overthrow
or set at defiance Ihe constituted authorities
of the State and of the United States witliiu
such State'/
Third. Are the constituted authorities in
complicity with or do they connive at the
unlawful purposes ofsttch combinations?
Fourth. Is the conviction of offenders or the
preservation of the public safety impracticable
by reason of all or either of these causes ?
Fifth. 1 f the conviction of offenders and the
preservation of the public safely be not at the
present moment impracticable, does the past
give such reason to apprehend such a state of
aifairs as will render them impracticable, and
as will require this power to be lodged in the
President for the protection of the public wel-
lax-e ?
These inquiries open a very wide field of
investigation; but I do not propose to follow
any ol them at great length, nor can I take
them up in their order, as the testimony which
I shall consider will bear upon them all. There
was a time when it might have been advisable
to dwell upon the evidence establishing the
existence of the iiu Klux Klan, the combina-
tion against which principally it is well known
this legislation was directed ; hut that time has
passed. its existence now stands confessed.
In speaking of South Carolina, in the views of
the minority of the committee upon the con-
dition of the late insurrectionary States, they
say this:
" Wo pass, then, tho negro testimony for whatever
it is worth. But while wo do this, we do not deny
that in that poition of South Carolina emninonly
known as the Piedmont region, embracing ihe
counties of iSpartanburg, Laurens, Chester, and
York, a broken and somewhat mountainous region
of country, largely populated by an ignorant, um'd-
ueated, and, when excited by wrong, a lawlerb class
of whito people, there have been within the last
eighteen months or two years numeious instances
of lawless outrage upon the black population by
disguhsed men known by the name of Ku Klux ,* but
that this state of things, to any considerable extent,
grows out of politics, in the ordinary partisan sense
of the term, wo do most emphatically deny."
Passing from the consideration of a single
State to the condition of the States generally,
the minority say:
" While we do notintondto dony that bodied of
disguised men have, in several of the States of the
South, been guilty of the most ilopcruntcrimes, crimcs
which we neither seek to palliate nor excuse, forthÂ©
commission of which tho wrongdoers should, when
ascertained and duly convicted, suffer speedy and
and condign punishment, we deny that these men
