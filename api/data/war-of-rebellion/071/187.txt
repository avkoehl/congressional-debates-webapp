GETTYSBURG, July 10, 1864.

Major-General COUCH:

A Union officer, who escaped from Frederick in citizen's clothing yesterday after enemy occupied it, states that a large force passed through the city from west. A rebel officer told him that it was Early's division, and Early had been made major-general; and that Bradley Johnson's division was then passing another road. The force he saw consisted of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, a long train of ambulances; he then left. Met frequent rebel squads taking horses as far north as Lewistown, and he came through by same turnpike on which we went. He heard heavy firing toward Frederick that enemy attacked us at Monocacy Junction yesterday forenoon. Fighting continued until evening, when we burned the county bridge and block-house on west of Monocacy and fell back. Bradley Johnson's division was reported advancing north of Frederick and upon the Baltimore turnpike. We need a few horses for scouts; are we authorized to procure them, and how?

YORK, July 10, 1864.

Major-General COUCH:

I can turn out an armed force 400 convalescents if you will send 100 arms and accouterments and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, caliber Numbers 58, Springfield rifles. I cannot procure sufficient horses for scouting without seizing them.

HENRY PALMER,

Surgeon, U. S. Volunteers.

BALTIMORE, July 10, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General COUCH:

Within is the copy of dispatch to Mr. Cameron*. The state of affairs in Baltimore is terrible. Bells were rung at 6. 30 a. m. calling loyal citizens together to form companies to man fortifications for protection of the city. My road is still intact, but scouts report rebels within seven miles of Cockysville.
