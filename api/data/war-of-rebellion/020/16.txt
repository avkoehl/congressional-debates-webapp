Numbers 1. Reports of Brigadier General S. R. Gist, C. S. Army.

NEAR BATTERY ISLAND,

[May 20, 1862]-1.15 p. m.

CAPTAIN: The largest gunboat has taken position near Grimball's Landing. One has anchored just opposite to Legare's; another is at Battery Island. Three only have passed the obstructions near Battery Island. They are shelling in all directions at intervals; have command of the roads leading to Cole's and Battery Islands. One is just opposite to the point where the general and myself thought of placing the rifled guns, within 400 yards of it. I would like to have another company of cavalry for a few days. One is not sufficient for the duties of guards, &amp;c., across this island and up the Stone. I would like to have Hampton's if it can be spared. The boats at anchor and have not fired for fifteen minutes.

Respectfully,

S. R. GIST,

Brigadier-General.

Captain WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ON THE ROAD NEAR LEGARE'S,

May 20, 1862-2.15 p. m.

SIR: Two of the enemy's gunboats entered Stono about 12 m.; passed along Goat and Cole's Islands shelling, and are now at anchor around Kiawah Point, in full view of Battery Island, throwing occasional shells in different directions. I have withdrawn the troops from Cole's and from Battery Islands and fired the building at both these places. The property saved. I will keep close watch and report further.

By order of Brigadier-General Gist:

CARLOS TRACY,

Aide-de-Camp.

Captain LEO D. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
