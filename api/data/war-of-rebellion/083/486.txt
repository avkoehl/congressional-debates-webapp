were not favorable and I left the farther movement of the right to Colonel Blair, who was soon after joined by General Deitzler. I was directed by an old man, a Missouri patriot of seventy-five years, through a narrow defile to Brush Creek with Dodge's battery and other forces. With trembling, sinking steps the old man directed us to a position where we immediately began to demonstrate against the enemy that occupied the inclined plain and wooded heights on the south of Brush. The weary veteran refused to ride, but sunk down with delight and exhaustion when he saw the success of our guns. Like many other brave Missourians of that day he saw the rebellion vanishing before him and his home and country free. Moving farther down Brush Creek to the left I found Colonels Ford and Jennison skirmishing fiercely and evidently successfully pressing the enemy back. Thinking it a favorable time I immediately ordered a cavalry charge, one by the main road, and another by a road leading to the left and front, supported by advancing skirmishers and second lines. At the same time I directed General Blunt to advance in support with McLain's battery, and other artillery. The cavalry charges led by Lieutenant-Colonel Hoyt and Captain Thompson dashed forward with a terrible shout, carrying the heights and stone fences, which were immediately occupied by our main forces, and I soon saw our line, extending far away on my right, emerging from the dark forests of Brush Creek.*

The enemy was soon overpowered, and after a violent and desperate struggle fell back to another elevation on the broad prairie and operated their artillery and cavalry to their utmost ability in a vain attempt to check our general movement. Our militia continued to come swarming out of the forest, displaying a length and strength of numbers that surprised me. Their movement was steady, orderly, and gallant. Every piece of artillery, especially the little howitzers, was in active fire, showing artillery enough to represent an army of 50,000. This display of force, rather than effective fire, seemed to cause the enemy to increase his distance before us, while we steadily advanced all arms over a beautiful prairie, where both armies were in full view. It was at this time, about 11.30 a. m., i telegraphed you and my anxious friends in the rear that the victory was ours. At about 12 m. the guns of General Pleasonton were heard on our left, and at 2 p. m. his lines were in full and successful co-operation on the left. The enemy's retiring movement was immediately changed to a complete rout and our troops took up the pursuit at full speed. I met with General Pleasonton at a farm-house on Indian Creek, where he related to me his movements, which had also commenced early in the morning and included active operations most of the day. To give a full detail of matters I submit the reports of my associate officers, but especially collate the following extracts:

General Blunt says:

All the night of the 22nd was occupied in getting ammunition and subsistence to my command, with the view of commencing the attack upon the enemy at daylight the following morning. Daylight on the morning of the 23rd revealed the enemy in force on the open prairie directly south of Westport and about two miles distant. Colonel C. W. Blair's brigade of State militia was ordered out from Kansas City at 3 a. m., and at daylight my whole command was in motion, moving in column through Westport and across Brush Creek, and soon after sunrise the First, Second, and Fourth Brigades were deployed into line of battle on the south side of the timber skirting Brush Creek, where Shelby's division, of Price's army, was advancing upon
