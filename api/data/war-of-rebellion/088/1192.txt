General R. E. LEE, Chaffin's Bluff, Va.:

Dispatches of 1 and 1.45 o'clock just received. Prisoners state that Second Corps has relieved Ninth Corps in the trenches. Signal station reporting movements of troops would seem to confirm this. Every available man who can be spared from trenches has been withdrawn. Shall try attack in the morning with all the force I can spare. I will call on Wilcox for a brigade as instructed.
