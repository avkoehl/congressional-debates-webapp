and prisoners paroled. Lists forwarded with prisoners to Captain Hatch. Use large clerical force. First detachment might be sent without delay and lists made for the rest.

W. M. GARNDER,

Brigadier-General.

GREENSBOROUGH, February 19, 1865.

General BRAGG:

Conflict orders received about prisoners. No prison or sufficient guard here. Advise me what to do.

J. C. HOLMES,

Major, Commanding.

CHARLOTTE, February 19, 1865.

Brigadier General B. J. JOHNSON:

Prisoners much excited about exchange. It would be very injudicious to remove Lieutenant Long just now.

H. FORNO,

Colonel, &amp;c.

SUGAR LOAF, February 19, 1865.

Major PARKER:

The supplies given the Yankee prisoners by the commissary are sufficient. You will give strict orders to Colonel Jackson to allow no communication with them whatever by citizens or soldiers, which must be carried out.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, February 20, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Hoffman reports, in answer to your telegram of the 15th, that there were then no prisoners of war in irons at Johnson's Island. On the 17th Thomas F. Berry was placed in irons for killing another prisoner, viz, Lieutenant Harlin Morgan.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

37 BLEECKER STREET, New York, February 20, 1865.

General W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: General Beall calls my attention to two requisitions for supplies for prisoners received from Johnson's Island and Fort Warren, in which bedsacks are included, and requests that these be furnished by the U. S. authorities. I am not informed as to the rule adopted by the War Department, but suppose the general will not be required to furnish the bedsacks. If I am right allow me to ask you to give the proper instructions in these cases.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. E. PAINE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
