Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, Fort Monroe, May 25, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commanding-General of Prisoners.

COLONEL: I inclose herewith copy* of letter from Mr. Ould. I telegraphed you this morning in relation to paroles. A fair construction of article 7 of the cartel requires all captures to be reduced to possession and delivered at the two places agreed on. The Confederates will accept Baton Rouge at the West (though they have not yet officially so informed me). City Point is of course already agreed on at the East. All questions relating to officers must be adjusted at City Point, and I hope that instructions will be issued to send all rebel captured officers to some place at the East to await disposition. I am anticipating much trouble in relation to officers, and am of opinion we should hold on to all we have, even if declared exchanged, to abide action on the part of the enemy. With this view I shall retain Colonel Morehead and others at Fort Monroe.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

P. S. - All our officers will be sent to Richmond.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, Fort Monroe, May 25, 1863.

Hon. ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

SIR: Your threaten retaliation in your letter of the 22nd instant in case certain parties whom you have demanded are not delivered to you. I beg leave to inform you that no deliveries of any kind will be made to you under such threats. If such threats are withdrawn deliveries can be made of parties properly entitled to release but not otherwise. Three-fourths or nine-tenths of the cases of which you have furnished memoranda have been released and delivered to you. If before the necessary investigations in the remaining cases have been made you put in practice retaliation either upon our officers or men I give you formal notice that the United States Government will exercise their discretion in selecting such persons as they think best, whether officers or privates, for the purpose of counter retaliation.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, Fort Monroe, May 25, 1863.

Hon. ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
