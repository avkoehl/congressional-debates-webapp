Johnson's life of CJieene íounily taxes Morns withineompe
tency or negligence in failing to furnish funds for the American
army in the last campaign of the Revolution Marshall, in his
Life of Washington, vindicates him from this serious charge by
a curiou-* explanation, derived, jie say* fiom Morns himself
In order to aid the distressed aimy of Greene, without dim>
mshing the General's exertions to deuve supp rt fiom other
quarters, by creating an opinion that supplies could be drawn
Irom Morris, he employed a secret agent to attend the Southern
army as a volunteer, unknown to the General, and to furnish
him with a draft on Morris, whenever Gieene'sembrrrassmcnts
became otherwise irretrievable—a striking picture of Amen
can finances and armaments at that crisis' Hundreds of
Gieene's soldiers fousnt the gallant Carolina battles, literally
staik naked, with no covering but rags round their lmas and
tufts of straw *o rest their muskets on their shoulders These
naked heioes had no pay but plunder, or seciet supplies wrung
from the slow leave of Morns'*, clandestine emissary Ihe
Indians m the British aimy were better Clothed and paid, but
their savage patriotism was not mote indomitable than that of
these rude forefathersof uneducated chivalry It has been said
by good authority that the Declaration oflndependence wascar
i led m Congiess by Morns'saccidental absence,he being of the re
spectable party not then altogether despairing of reconciliation
with Great Britain, and believing that memorable Declaration
premature If he had been present the votes of Pennsylvania
would have been equally divided, which would have left the
measure without a maiouty It in now understood that all the
signatures were not affixed the 4th of July, 1776 When duly
proclaimed, Robert Morris, like other patriots gave this great
event his cor lial support risking thioughout the contest, life, a
considerable fortune, and sacred honor pledged to it
The last fiscal endeavoi oi the Congiess, towards the close of
the Revolution, was an approach to the more peifect union
which the Constitution of 1789 afterwaids substituted for the
Confederation of 1778 Congress asked the States to empower
it to lay an impost on all imported goods, limited to five per
cent a<l valorem ind twenty five yeais, for the di«cliaige of ex
isttng debts By this impost, it was thought that about one mil
lion oí dollars might be got the first year, to be increased after
wards to tw© millions and a half, to be funded, and, with furthei
means from the States, applied to extinguish the continental
debt The pressure of war being removed, objection^ between
the consuming and objecting States frustrated this design The
letter of Congress to the States, recommending it, is oi e of Ma
dison's earliest State paper* the reply by a report of Congress,
to the objections of Rhode Island, is one of Hamilton's—both
members of Congiess and their similar style of chas'e, calm,
argumentative appeal is exemplified in thes° documents, which
are foretastes of their reasoning m the Federalist The letter
of Congress to the States computes the public debt at foity two
millions, strongly ui^mg the policy and jus'ice of paying it
Provincial disunion, languoi, impoverishment uneasiness pre
vailed from the era of almo&t valueless independence till the
Constitution of 1789 Neither peace, plenty, nor transatlantic
security, restored the finances or advanced the prosperity of the
United States, till good government developed their natural ad
vantages The Revolution debt, though large, was&acredly ob
iigatoiy Continental money was favoied by the aident oppo
sers of Englanl The gieatest patriots were the greatest suf
ferersby it as in the case of- the French assignats and man
dats, those who with most zeal promoted revolution, were most
attached to the paper substituted for money American royal
ists, like French loyalists repudiated and did not therefore
much suffer by it If, in 1783, con'mental money had been m
every one's hands, diffused throughout the wh le countiy, with
tolerable equality its dereliction as an act of national bank
ruptcy, wouldhardly have been so felt by a people, all oí them
participators in its advantages and disadvantages
Ño histoncal account of the currency of the Un ted States
can overlook the process of continual sttuggle between hard
and paper money foi mastery, before, during, and since the Re
volution    It was under the dire discipline of the continental
money school, that Washington   constitutionally avene to no
velties, systematic, circumspective, contracted aveisicn to pa
per, superadded to habitual attachment to the established mo
ney of all mankind    It was m the same school whose lessons
were then just beginning, that they who at ranged the Articles of
Confederation m 1778, learned the wisdom of, atlea*-tin theoiy,

< learly indicate     Finally   the «¡aces who   with  Washing on,
Franklin, Hamilton, Morn**, and Madison, from the Articles of
Confederation and the hard expenenceof Government without
good currency, as well ifter as during the Revolution, com
poseí the Constitution of 1789   plainly signify, by numerous
kindred clauses in that instrument, that paper money was no

that a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against pa

With the Federal Constitution, which gave the whole im

liberty, equality, and laboi let alone, to develope, advance and
mature then natural advantages with unexampled, prodigious,
and marvellous opontaniety    A palsying confederation sub

regulate commeice   encourage   manufactures,   md   produce
national wealth     The pieranous outset ol  commerce and
navigation, manufartuies, and even agriculture, needed exclu

and wretchedness, was the result Lady Mary Wortiey
Montague relates, that at Rome in 1740, there was an absolute
want oi all but paper money, occasioned by an adoption there
of Law's contrivance, when he was banished from France to
Italy Hei banker Belloni had but a few sequins "They go to
market, says she, with paper, pay-their lodgings with paper No
specie is to be seen, which brings everything to such extrava
gant prices, that nobody knows what to ask for their goods.
The Pope declares that while practising law, (he was bred
a lawyer) he never knew want, but, as Pope, he, together with
the tetate, is wretchedly poor The country ib almost annilu
lated with it " Swift's sharp pen was exercised on this infatua-
tion No foolish superstition was ever more absurd than the
supposition that bank paper is capital Alchemy, Sibyl's leaves,
Delphic oracles, Lleusimao mysteries, animal magnetism, were
not more irrational The wildest popular infatuation is not
more despicable than the imposture of irredeemable bank
notes, by which a small minority has governed the great ma-
jority of the people of the United States Vitiated admim3tra*
tion of a system, in itself vicuus, has betrayed Legislature*
into systtmatised infidelity, and communities mto masses of

Madison m the Federalist—make hanks the arbitrary govern

trenie'y questionable whether State Legislatures are authorized
to chartei banks at all, much less paper issue banks, by over
whelming action, usage, sanction, and habit, they have become
the craving apj etite of universal avarice, like food and fun
(panem et cm cpnsps) lo the Roman populace, a wantmsieted
on and at all hazards indulged Thousands of banks char
tered, mcorpoiated, pnvileged, dedicated, and gm with om.ni
potence to make paper money, is the most incredible
and stupendous practiaal infatuation the world ever wit-
nessed lso ancient superstition, Asiatic or other bar
banaii idolatry, is to be compaied with it It is the
same, only much woise, as incorporating a thousand State
distilleries to make whiskey, with peculiar privileges for the
dissemination of it throughout the community, and, crowning
them waha National Bank, also to make paper money, is the
same as il Congress were to mcorpoi ate a gi eat national distil
leiy, with branches m the States to regulate and conuol the
quantity and prices of the whiskey disposed of by the State m-
coi poiated distilleries,
The pretext for excessive bank paper and small bank notes
is the demonstrably false assumption that there are not gold and
silver enough foi ruculation Exclusively metallic currency,
which noboly contends lor is denounced as the companion ol
want, of slavery, and of barbarism, and not only the unthink-
ing butnumbetsot the intelligent, sharp wittedand most mte-
l toted m the expulsion of paper money, are clamorous against
specie The contrivance of New "Verkand Isev? England, by
small notes, to supplant and banish com, kem to nominal par
bysafety fundbor teuffolkbanks, is not quite as bad, though not
much belter, than the bank suspensions of other places The
<nly leal cmrency is where, without small notes, every bank
notéis forthwith redeemable m com lili that restoiation takes
place, American circulation must always keep down American
industiy, and those Sta'es which adheie to it will always enjoy
favorable exchange against those using small notes The act*
of Consress of 1834 regulating gold and silvei coins, and esta-
bhshirt" their propei standaids, restored them to sufficient quan
titymthe United States and at this time (1841) the difference
between specie and good bank notes is very hule There is
plenty of com for circulation, but hardly any m circulation,
owing to bank notes
Although rtstoiation of metallic currency is not to be ex
pected, it by no means follows however, that it is notdesira
ble losiead of diminishing, as is eironeously supposed, ex-
clusive coin cunency increases circulation It makes mot ey
more abundant, instead of scarce, as is the clamor of the incon-
siderate In Trance, for instance, the whole of the hard money
may be reckoned at about fivehundred millions of dollars, and
the whole of the paper money at about one hundred millions of
dolíais The whole of the com money and oí the paper money
of England both together, at about two hundred and fifty mil-
lions of dollars each, fivehundied millions together J his the
com cui rency of England is but about one half that of Fiance,
the paper cunency two anda half times more When the Bank
of England suspei ded coin payments, instead of increasing, it
diminished the total circulation One half of it, the com part,
or nearly so, di-appeared two hundred and fifty millions of
dollars At the same time the paper part depreciated, reduc
me the pound sterling eventually, during suspension, fiom
twenty to fourteen shillings The same effects, but aggravated,
tike I lace in the United States In this way panics are ex-
plained When France needs any thing she has not within
herself biead for instance, she takes of her metal money as
much &> will buy it abroad If she expend fifty minions
of dollars for bread, she has four hundred and fifty millions of
do lar., m com st 11 left of her own, together with the one hun-
dred millions of her paper circulation befoie mentioned five
hundred and fiity millions of dollars current, fiom which sum
the withdrawal of fifty millions produces no shock or panic
But whenevei England wants fifty millions of dollars worth of
bread, or any thing else which she h^s not oí her own, she
sends away so large a proportion of her com that it derange*-,
