Very respectfully,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, May 14, 1861.

Governor CHARLES S. OLDEN,

Trenton, N. J.:

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters of the 11th instant, presented to me by Colonel John G. Stevens, and it gives me pleasure to say that I believe Mr. Stevens' interview with the Department has been entirely satisfactory to him. Having fully advised him in regard to the troops yet desired from New Jersey, he has departed for home, and will be much better able verbally to inform you in regard to the inquiries of your letters than I can by writing.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 14, 1861.

Governor E. D. MORGAN,

This Department has accepted the Seventy-ninth Regiment, New York Highlanders, for three years' service.

SIMON CAMERON,

ALBANY, N. Y., May 14, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Advised you by mail yesterday that five regiments would be forwarded to Washington the present week. I intend to accomplish it. Nothing can prevent but equipments. Five others will follow, in all, next week. The above ten regiments will be for two years or for the war.

E. D. MORGAN.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 14, 1861.

Send on immediately over the Northern Central road through Baltimore three regiments, if armed and equipped and willing to be mustered into service for three years or during the war, of the troops which are in excess of the quota of your State, and could not be accepted by you under the first requisition of the President.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
