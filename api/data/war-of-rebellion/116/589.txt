FORT MONROE, May 24, 1862.

Honorable P. H. WATSON, Assistant Secretary of War:

Colonel Joseph Drake can pass into Virginia by Fort Monroe to Petersburg. Keep him a few days until the privatters come to this post for exchange with our hostages. I will send a flag of truce to-morroe to ascertain when the hostages can be forwarded for exchange. Seemy telegram of this date to the Secretary of War. It is reported that the rebels are leaving Richmond and reports say they are going North. More likely, if it is true, they are going to join Beauregard to overwhelm Halleck. General McClellan did not think they were leaving yesterday.
