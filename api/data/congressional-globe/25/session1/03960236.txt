This amendment will create confidence, ana when c rfil^nre
isreVived they will be able to resume That time is not fdi
di-itani, if The confidence of Government was not withdrawn
from them, but if the mi.asure of this bill i-, catned into effect,
it will be impossible foi them to resume
With respect to the subject of Lxecutive patronage it is
not my intention to detain the-senate with any remarks upon
this part of the scheme What the Senitoi fiom Virginia has
said upon it is forcible and conclusive on this point let us,
however bear in mind that we aie not now legislating cither
for the present or for the past but f r the future I ^ppre
hend no danger from the pre ent Executive In hin I have
perfect confidence I have known him from early manhood
walking within the bounds and limit-, of the Constitution
But the day may atnve when the chair of the Chief Magistrate
may be filled by in mlividual ready to abuse his trust and
then our action wilt have iurmshel him \vi h tht means and

Mr President, this is a most important crisis m the afFans

over us Sir, we are asked to adopt a system which 1 ftai
will prove most disastrous m its íesults if earned into execu

execute I will not attempt ti descrío? the consequences of
such a state of things I hope my anticipations may not be
realizea butT look foiward to the cotmm n atmn of this mei

SPEECH OF MR. LEGARE,
Op South Carolina
In Ifce House of Representatives, October —,  1837—
On the bill imposing additional duties, is deposi-
tories in certain cases, on public officers
Mr LEGARE said
Mr Chairman I do not know how I can more
appropriately begin the remarks I am about to
make, than in the very words with which a most
able English writer, addressing himself to the
causes and character oí the recent crisis, concludes
his- "The events, (says Mr Samuel Jones Lloyd,
in a pamphlet published last spring,) which have
occurred in connexion with the late pressuie upon
the moneyed and mercantile interests, aie full of
instructive illustrations of the effects both benefi-
cial and otherwise, of our present sv stem, and the
evil consequences of this pressure will be as nothing,
compared with its benefits, if, amongst these, ne
shall be enabled to reckon an increased degi ee of
intelligence upon subjects connected with cuuency,
and a nearer approximation to sound principles in
the management of out paper issues " The revul-
sion, it is true, has been far moie disastrous on this
side of the Atlantic than in England, and yet even
at its darkest period—now, as I confidently believe,
passed away to give place to returning prosperity—
I lound consolation in the idea, that detrlj as wc
were buying our experience in this important matter
the price would not be too high tor the benefits we
should ultimately derive fiom our reveises A na-
tional visitation ought to be considered as a great
providential lesson It teaches the most momen-
tous truths, and it teaches them m the most impres-
sive manner, and what we have recently seen and
felt Will dispose us—if any thing can dispose Us—
to look the difficulties, with which this subject is
surrounded, fairly in the face
Sir, it « sui rounded with difficulties Even in
England, a  you perceive from the cilation I have
just made, they are felt and acknowledged by the
most able men I have upon my desk many other
proofs of the same fact Tney abound, foi di-
stance, in the minutes of evidence taken before the
committee of the House of Ctirmons on the re-
newal of the charter of the Bank of England, in
1832 You will find theie, that wnile high authon
ties* agiee in thinking that the-e should be but one
bank of issue for the capital, at least, if not for the
whole country the representatives of the great
commercial and manufacturing interests, on the
contrary, protest against the co ltirmance of a mo-
nopoly to which they impute the most sinister in-
fluences ovci their immense business,! and demand
a system of joint-slock banks, regulated by pimei-
ples more agreeable, as the; contend, to the course
and policy 01 trade    A third party insists upon the

worthy of lemark, that these lemonotiauces we e admitted to
be well founded by the change which in consequence of them

necessity of compelling all banks of issue to give
adequate security to the public, (in Government
stock, ¡tc.) for the redemption of then issues,?
while every stockholdei or partner shall continue
to be, as at present, responsible foi all the debts of
the company, to the whole amount ofhispuvate
fortune A fourth, (and I have just íeceiv ed from
London a Utile volume in which that opinion is
most plausibly maintained,) urges the most un-
limited freedom in banking, and sees no more dan-
ger to society from perfect liberty m this, than m
any otnei branch of business, the supplying, for
example, the market of a great capital with the ne-
cessaries of lite § In this complexity and distrac-
tion of English opinion upon this subject, however,
all parties agiee in one thing, and that is, in adher-
ing to the paper 'jstem Nobody theie thinks of
any thing so extravagant as the overthrow of that
system, whatever defects maj be seen or supposed
to exist m it, or whatever projects may have been
imagined to punfy, to correct, and to improve it
Rut if such is tne s ate of English opinion m re-
gaid to this subject, how must n be vv ith us, when
to all the intrinsic difficulties of the thing itself, we
add those arising out of the complicated structuie
of our political institutions? It would be hard
enough to say what ought to be done, in the present
emergency, were tin  a simple consolidated Gov-
ernment, but how much harder is it to advise the
admimstiation of a Federal Government as to the
course it ought to puisue, where one happens to
doubt its possessing all the power necessary to give
complete relief, without a co-operation of olheis<
For, sir, at the risk of being set down m that cate-
goiy of " tiny politicians," of whom the gentleman
from Maryland, (Mr W Cost Johnson,) m a very
amusing speech, in the course of whiJi, however,
he uttered some grave and important trutns, «poke
last night with such profound contempt, I must con-
fess I agree with the Executive m the general pim-
cipks of constitutional l¿w involved in the mes-
sage In the division of the attributes of sove-
ieiBnty betuetn this Government and the States, n
may and must happen, that we should expeuence
sometimes i chasm, < nd sometimes a conflict of
powers More i  taken from the States, perhaps,
than has b<=eii given to the confederacy, neither
can do enough, while each can do too much, for
perfect harmony , defects, discrepancies, and con-
tradictions, e-s:ist in the scheme itself, detected only
in a long course of practice , and which nothing
but practical skill, the wisdom called for and called
forth in the management of great affairs, especially
pol tical affairs, can reconcile and reclifv tin
doubtcdly the task is an immensely difficult one—
but it must be undertaken, and it must be done
The subject befoie the committee is an example of
the high and difficult duties I refer to, nor can I
imagin" an occasion better fitted than this to
awaken the house to a lively sense of its infinite i e-
sponsibtlities to the country
Judge, then, sir, with what deep disappointment
and regret, I learned that the bill on the table was
to be pressed upon us at this short session It is
quite enough foi me, that it proposes a great inno-
vation upon the whole course of the Government,
from its foundation up to the present moment, and
upon all the hab Is of our people They who see
deeper or clearer into such matters thin I do, must
pa-don me for declaring that I cannot, conscien-
tiously vote for 'he measure in such haste If I
had no posiltic objections to it, it «ould be quite
enough for me, that I have not had sufficient time
ts reflect on it During this extraordinary session,
(for so it has been in eveiy sense of the word,)
fatigued, harra^sed, exhausted, by incessant at-
tendance, by night and bv day, in this hall, it has
not beemn my powei to infoim myself on any sub-
ject as I could have wished tobe able to do I
have had absolu'elj no time for minute research,
hardly a few hours for calm reflection Under such
circumstances, I cannot vote for the bill I must
go home to my constituents and talk with them
Many,  perhaps   most of them, understand these

matters better than I do, but when I left them, al-
though this subject bad been discussed, and ably
discussed, here and there, by an individual or two,
public attention had not been awakened to it, and
nothing like an opinion—certainly no opinion fa-
vorable to the punciple of the bill—had been
formed m regard to it
And here, sir, I might take my seat again, if I
had usen only to explain my own vote, 01 to in-
fluence those of others, on the proposed measure
But the true issue seems to me very far to trans-
cend, m importance, that single measure, impor-
tant as it unquestionably is It involves, in my
opinion, the whole credit system of the country
I do not say that the bill on vour table presents that
issue, still less that the Executive message presented
it, or piopounded any principle or opinion that
should lead to it But no one who has u atched the
progres  of this discussion, in this House or m the
Senate—-m or out of this Capitol—will deny that
it must soi n come to that Sn, if theie is any
truth, at all, in what has been urged with great
ability and all the zeal, I had almost said, the fa-
naticism, of the deepest conviction, by men ac-
customed to influence, na), even to control public
opinion m difFeient parts of this country—if they
have any idea of rigorously carrying out the pun-
ciples they profess, to their logical consequences,
in practice—if what they say in the highest places,
on the most solemn occasions, is not such idle de-
clamation as such men are not to be suspected of—
they mean that, and nothing short of that Doc-
trines bav e been uttered, with all the authority
which can be imparted to paradox from talent
ripened by experience, w hich seem to me inconsis-
tent with the constitution, not only of American,
but of all modern society, with its whole spirit and
tendency—with all its wants and all its ways I
have, sometimes, m the course of the debates,
looked around me to see where I really was—
whethei the shade of some old lawgiver, some
Minos or Lycurgus, had not been evoked, to bring
a degenerate age back to the stern principles of
Donan polity, to an agrarian equality of property,
ti iron money and black broth, or else, if it were
not, the splnt of Benedict or Bernard, returned to
the holy solitudes of Monte Casino, or Clum, or
Citeaux, to preach to a world lost m vanity and
pleasure, the blessings of poverty and mortifications
of the flesh Now, sir, it may be true that luxury,
according to the old saw, is the ruin of Slates, and
that sumptuary and agrarian laws are necessary to
maintain your true Spartan discipline But I am
excessively disinclined to try any such experiment
upon my constituents , at least without receiving
an express instruction, to that effect, from them.
I am afraid they have no taste for black broth ,
that Spartan discipline will be irksome, and even
revolting to them In short, sir, I have reason to
believe, that without being as deeply imbued, per-
haps, as other people are, with the spirit of the age,
they do still partake too much of it, to be willing
to forego the many agreeable objects that princi-
pally engage and excite it
Sir, I am far from denying, that m the eyes of a
stern reformer, with opinions of a certain com-
plexion, this generation is a perverse and crooked
one We love money, I admit, as much as men
ever did—certainly as much as they did in the
Augustan age, nearly two thousand years ago.
The committee w ill excuse mv quoting a very com-
mon piece of Latin to prove it, after the example
of other gentlemen in this debate
