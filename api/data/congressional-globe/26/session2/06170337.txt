will also find ihat £86 000 tas, within the last ycdr,
been expended for toe Cnmbeiland road m Illinois
and Indiana As to the Florida war, more than a mil-
lion of dollars (about §1 5r0,000) appears to have
been expended for it within tne last year, indepen-
dently of the pay and  subsistence of   yt ur  army
there   How much, in all conscience, do gentlemen
wish to have appropriated for  that purpose?    And
was it true that the Adrnims ration was blamed for
not naving brougnt this war to a close?    Had it
not employed the most gallant ana distingui^ned of
your   officer^,   including  even   one   ot  the pro
mjjent Whig heroes, upon wnom the eye  oí so
many of his party wete already fixed ¡or the b.ghest

and Lundy'o Lane, the Id ire of wno c wel -earn-
ed laurels, won m  bloody confl c t, with his coun-
try's enemies, so many of  his imprudent  fnends

politics, and attempting to elevate him to a stat on

still the Semiioie was there, still did he cling to the

[Mr. Monroe nere remarked that Gen Scon

Mr. V. said he b.3d nDt mentioned the name of
that gallant so dier, the friend of his coH^-g te, for
the purpose ot dravun^ in question Ivs military skill
or pro a ess, tar from it, he cs ■na ej to be the pergonal

he had a ngnt to claim, for the Admnistration that

ing this war which resulted from the use of the
most efficient means wi hm us command It was
for this purpose tha' he allad-d to the ill success
against the Seminóles which had attended the ef-
forts of the best and biavest of 5our officer'-.
Bat it is said, though u may be true tha' the Go-
vernment has got through the year 1840 by expend-
ing only twenty two mill oas of dollars lor ordinary
purposes, yet that thi> ha  been accomplished by
shuffling and staving oil i¡s obi ganóos, thus throw-
ing an undue bju'en upon us successor

forSU 000 without specifying the precise objects to which tha
money was to be applied Having every reason to believe that
he had at this late period already procured and paid for ail his
supplies, it was piesumed that tins sum was required to be
carried out in dollars to meet any incidental expenses that
might arise on her passage to Rio Janeiro, where she was or
dered to stop to replenish her supplies, for the payments of
which her commander was authorized to draw on Bafmgs,
Brothers, and Company of London
So large a sum was not, therefore, deemed necessary to the
purpose for which in was supposed to have been drawn, and
S5 000 was substituted that being deemed quite sufficient It
afterwards appearea tnat fhe purser had not yet paid for his
supplies, although all his requisitions had been promptly com
ptie 1 with, with this single exception, and was, it appears then
arrested by hio creditors at Boston, in the apprehension that the
vessel wasahiut to sail A delay of several days occurred m
c jnsequence It will thus be perceived that t£e state of the

this vessel                        *-

Very respectfully, sir,
Your obedient servant,

Honorable A  Vandekpool,
House of Representatives,,
Here, sn, is a true statement of ¡he circumstances
connected wi h the detention of the frigate constel-
'ation. But it was proper that he should state
another fact n regard to this purser, which would,
prob.ib'y, account ior the origin oí the complaint
which the honorable member from Maine had been
mstru ner tai m bringing before the House He
had been informed (and he had derived his mfor-
ma'ion fr'm   the h gaest   a d   most responsible
ource) that the stores which the pursers distribute
to the rrpws of ship*; of v ar, are divided mto "ne-
cesssr.es,' "comjmts," and "luxuries." Bread and
men come under tbe head of "necessaries." Tea
and coffee, according to the interpretation of the
Secretaiy of the Navv, fall under the denomination
of "comforty and tobacco, if you please, under
that of "luiunes," that the purser is authorized ts
charge a much larser pel centage of profitb upon
"comforts" than "luxuries," and that this purser
claimed the right to charge for tea and coffee as for
"luxuries " The Sfcretary of the Navy forbade
him to do =o, at which the purser took umbrage,
and wished to be detached from the vessel, but the
Secretary refused to yield to this wish This just
interference of the Secretary with the plans and in-
tentions of the purser had, no doubt, been the
means, direct or indirect, of bringing to the consi-
deration of the gentleman from Maine the in-
formation npon this subject which he had
felt constrained to lay b fore the House; and
he would n'iw submit it to the candor of that
gentleman whether he had treated th« Secretary
with perfect fairness. He would consider it as
doiiis great injustice even to himself, if, the strength
of ex parte representations, made to him by an em-
fa ttered man, who should come sneaking to him
with his tales oi abu«e, without the courage and
manliness to authorise his name to be given as
th"ir auihoi, he should here chargeahigh and most
respectable pubhc officers with official delinquency.
The honorable member from Maine will* perceive
that I have not forgotten his commamcation,
anonymous as to the Howe, about the "sedetUary
nnhha" of Florida
So, also, m regard (o the certificates for works en
the fortification , a'luded to by several gentlemsn,
on which, it was «aid, interest had been charged by
the banlts, to the prejudice of the poor laborers.
He understood ihe following to be the truth of this
matte' During the loDg session oí Congress, ths
anproations ar  not generally made, till the month
of June or July. Early in the spring, and m anti-
capation of he appropriations, laborers on the pab-
le work*, being oat ot employment, have genearl-
ly been m the habit of pressing the superintendents
of the works with lmpertumt es to permit them
t j commence working immediately, offenng to take
their chance of the appropriations being made.
Superintendents have frequently yielded to their
importunititi, and at the end of each week given
tl em certificates of the balance due them for the
past week, to be paid "when the approprtattonforthe
wo.kshouldbe «wit." ^hese ¡aboieis, pressed by
immed ate want, have always been more or less
in the habit of getting these certificates cashed, by
deducting an amount equal to the interest up to
the period when the appropriations would ptobably
