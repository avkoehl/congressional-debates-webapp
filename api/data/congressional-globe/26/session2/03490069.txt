Pre-emption Law—Mr. Smith.
Senate.
gtcss, mttmatel}' too much connected with the va-
rious affairs of the nation Tbeie seems to be a
universal disposition and c"esire to make changes,
either in the mannei of the admwis ranon of the
lands or m the dispoMtitn of the fundb proceed ng
from their sales Ihe debt of tne Revolu ion has
been extinguished tne lands ceded by the Sute=
have been Iibeiated frrm that charge, and a new-
state of the qaesuon has beea presented by these
considerauonsv
I propooe to no*ice tne d fferent propositions that
have been maje for the di^posi ion of these )and>,
an as brief a mannei as I can, and show how tbry
stand. At the commencement of the last Congress
of the administration of Mr Adams, I tcok my
seat as a member of the House of Representatives
At that time the q íesüons of graduation and pre-
emption weie the favorites for di.cussion Well,
sir, pre-emption law , m  ome shape, have been
parsed from thaf day to thi°, ind we now have one
before Uc, differing somewhat m character from
any former 1  w, of which I will «peak herí after.
Bat, sir, the graduation bills have shared a very
different fate Not a session of Congress has been
held without discussing or acting upon a gradu
anon bill in some shape oi other General Jack-
son came into power on the tide of unbounded po>
pulanty Ins friend were devo ed to his person,
and his parti«ans su«taired his measures with great
«inammity. He was mo4 decidedly in favor of
graduation he held it up, as did his adherents in
the West, as the antagonist -measure to the distribu-
tion principle, as carried cui m Mr Clav's land
bill, and when the Pres dent defeated that bill, he
proclaimed graduation as the proper measure
Well, sir, he held the s auon for eight yeais, and
at the expira'ion of his tern, Mr Van Burea came
into power Like his predecessor, he, too, recom-
mended graduation, the Secretary of the Treasury
favored it as a financial measure, his partisans m
the West held it up to the people as an Administra-
tion measure At the kst session of Congress the
bill passed ihe Senate about the same time ih  pre-
emption bill did, they went to th* House logethe ,
the pre emption bill psssed, and the gt?dua i in bill
■slept on the table Tnere was power enough to
pasa the Sub Trep^urj b II and the pre enipnon b'l',
but the graduation bill was forgo ten Tin--, sir,
twelve years, including tlie adiminaralion>ofGene
ral Jackson and Mr V.tn Buren, have pa sed
away, and the graduation bi 1 stands precipe y
whtt e it did when I came to Congrí fir^t From
this I am led to believe ei her that there never w<is
any serious intention of passing it by tho e who
clamored the loudest for it, that it wo. meiely held
tip to the gaze of the people as the opposition mea
sure to distribution, for ihe ¡purpose of defeating
«he latter measure, or the people were opposed to
it, and the do nmant party knew it, and were afra d
to pase i', and la in  siy to Senator  now, that I
have net the lea t idea it ever will pass, unless it
bhall be conrected with tn-1 pre-emption and dis n-
bution pnncip'es upon tetms of compromise of the
whole  abject
The objections that are utged against the gradua-
tion bill are, first, tha it unstt le¡> the land policj,
seconlly, it reduce-, ti e puce ot the real estate of
the country, thirdly, tte principle cf gradaatioi,
by the time the lands t a e been in walk t, is arbi-
trary and unj isi, ira mucn as the tables of *-ales
show that lands which have been long in mafktt
still find pvrcna ers at the minimum pr ce of one
dollar and twenty-Ive cen s per acie The^-e ob
jectionsare enti'led t" due cons deration, and al-
though I do not expec  to live long enough to see a
graduatian law standing upon its own bas s 1 will
briefly notice them As to the first object on, it
will depend entmly on a prior question, that i«,
would the change bo foi the bet'et1 It so, there
can be no okjection on that ground, as fnquent
changes have been made, and the land syslem Iras
been much improved by them Instance the sub-
divisions of the traes, the introduction of the cash
for the credit system, ihe reduction of the price
from two dollar , which was the minimum, to ons
dollar and twentj-five cent", the present min mum
The second position is, that it reduces the pnce of
the real estaie of the counlry. This assumption I
think rather  specious than substantial,  it would
cenamly lend to &ell the land, and cause it to be
improved at a much earlier day than it otherwise
would be, and as the value of the improved land
depends upon the state of the improvement of the
ctu^try it follows that the cultivation pnd improve
meat of these lands at an early day must tend to
increase rather than dimmish the value cf ¡he other
improved lands in the same section oí country, at
least, the «ffac would not be perceptible against
this view In the next place, it is contended that
the pnrciple oi graduation by time—that ic, the
lengih oí time lands have been in ma ket—is arfei
traty and unjust, because lands that have been
long m maiket still find purchasers at the mini-
mum price This matter is perfectly plain and
simple of solution. Lands have an intrinsic and
arelaive value. A graduation bill by time only
«applies to ¡he intrinsic value cf lands, they are sold
by their re'ative value, by which I mean that the
locality, quality of soil, water privilege*, timber,
and many other qualities, compose ihe intrinsic va-
lue of a piece of land, and for which it re4 eives an
early purchaser, while lands wanting any of these
qualities would be passed by the settler in the first
instance, but, after ihe country around becomes
«.ettled and improved, these lands, thus passed by,
become relatively valuable in consequence of their
locality, ind not their original intrinsic value; and
lhat relative value finds for them purchasers I
have no doubt but ihat at least one half of the
lands that are now called refuse may in a series of
years be forced upon purchasers at the minimum
price This is my view of the matter. It looks
very plain to me, and yet it has excited a long de-
bate ¡o arciunt for the apparent phenomena, how
could it be possible that these lands con'd be infe
nor land*, and still find purchasers There are
connected with this par' of the argument two im-
portant queMion* First, is it right for the Govern-
ment to hold up the e Urds at a price above their
intiins c value, until they are =o!d by their relative
value, and tnereby avail itself of the industry of
the purchases of the surrounding lands to give
that relative va'ue' Tne o her ]«;, should the set-
ti ment oí the country be retarded, and the Stales
prohibited from taking the lands, until that relative
value shall have been given to ¡hem by the sur-
rounding improvements? 1 hive heretofore thought
that both of these questions should be decided m
the negative, and have vote I accordingly, and, as I
hive heard no complaint of my vote , 1 --hall m
this ¡nstanc take the laiae course, though I feel
quu  ea«y about it, and would willingly conform to
ihe will oi my State by voting either way, or make
a reasonable compioiii'e oí the whole mat'er to
secute greater benefits in the final adjustment of ihe
land ques'ion
I come now, Mr Pie^dcnt, to the more impor-
tan* question of pre-emption as embraced by the
b 11 before ui As I have already said, laws < n
this subject have been passed from tmn<  to tim-s,
d ffenng in com<* particn'ars from the bill before
us, wh ch I will look into as I progress with the ar-
gument
But, before I give my views upon the question, I
de«ire lo say a ie  words in relation to my vole
rgainst an amendment to the original bill, which
exclud°d foreigners from the benefits of pre-emp-
tion It has been uraed by Senators that the re-
s'ricon -hould have been incorporated m the bill,
they e^n'ena t at persons who have no interestm
our Gavcrrmeot, and who owe allegiance to a fo-
161*11 rower, ought not to have ihe oenefib of
a law v h ch ihe/ contend grants exclusive
pnvileg s Tnere is much force m the ar-
gunerr, and were thcie not countervailing consi-
derauons I shou d be dspostd to go with them,
but,nr, let nbe lemembered ihat, previous to ob
tain ng tht benefit o( the law, residence, improve-
ments on and cultivation of ihe land, are requisite
on tne part of the p'e-emj.tor, this I con-idered tan-
tamount to a declaration of a bona fide mienuon
on the part ot the settler to become a citizen of ihe
Unikd State, udeed, it is one of the most conclu
sive evidences of that internum that could well be
concpi red of Still, I voted to require the declara-
tion to be made in vm mg before the pre emption
shall operate I cannot agree with Senators who
think there is great danger of this clasj of foreign-
ers overturning or injunrg the Government, by
their votes or otherwise Sir, let me tell Senators
that this is not the class of men from whom danger
is to be apprehended. These are honest, hard-
working, industrious men, who support themselves
and families by the sweat of their brows; men, who
atieud to their o-vn busine<s, and not the couaerts
of the public, they are not Ihe class of political fo-
reigner who hang around your seaports and &e
suburbs of your largo cities, making politics their
trade, preach ng agrarian and loco foco doctrines
in the daytime, and lighting Soco feco matches and
noting at night—the levellers down, because they
cannot level up Men who do not betake them-
selves to honest call n™s foi a livelmood, and who
are the enemies of thos.e who do, these are the men
you may watch, but when you see a foreigner take
his fam ly i"4to the Western country, settle down on
a piece ot wild Ian'1, commence his little improve-
ment, sui rounded and aided by his wife and chil-
dren, you may re^t satisfied that you have nothing
to fear from him, he is of ihe usef u I class of foreign-
ers lhat ultimately become our best etizens. The
spirit that prompts him to acquire property will in-
duce him to protect and defeud it The other class
are not affeu-d by pre-emption laws, for ihey would
not cultivate and improve the new lands if you
would give them the privilege fier of cost. I hare
seen many of this class m the West as we^Ias m
the Eist, and I have never seen one of them ■*
claiming pre-emption privileges The other class
usually apply for the bn.efit of our naturalization
law?, and become citizers at the earliest period
possible, they are good members of society, and I
desire to give them all encouragement I can con-
sistently with the provisions of ihe Constitution.
Daring the d'scussion of this ques*on, the ar-
gument was pushed further than was called for by
the provisions of the bill, and ne* questions were
staned, or ra'her sprung upon u-, one of wlrcb,
being an important one, I am not dis.pos°d to let
pass without a brief nolics. It has been contend-
ed that the States nave the power to confer the
righ's of citiz ns, or, m other words, citizenship,
on foreigners, notwithstanding the Constataron of
the Uni ed Slates on that subject. Others have
contended ihat this can only be done in the ab-
sence of the exercise of the power of passing na-
turalization laws on the part of Congress. I heard
these op mons advanced by distinguished Senators,
and I confess I thought at the time tha both were
wiong—tlut those who contended for the first of
these positions were clearly and w1 oily mistaken,
and iha t*>o->e who admit the po ser in the States,
in ti e absei cc of the exercis  of the power by the
Federal Government, had taken ground that could
not be msnUrwd I supposed the whole power to
be exclusive m Congress, and that m no case, un-
der no cucumstances, cou d the States, or either of
them, exercise it, and I find, on corsultiag a high
authority, (Story on t! e Constitution,) that I was
right I will read to the Se iaie what that learned
commentator says on in  subject 3d vol. Com-
mentaries, chap. 16, he says
