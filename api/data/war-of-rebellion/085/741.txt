Major-General CURTIS:

I give you the first reliable report of the trouble immediately east of us. Twenty-five men and engine were sent to Otterville and the La Mine bridge to-day. Track all right; bridge burned slightly at one end, so as to fall; can be easily replaced; tank and depot and one or two houses burned; three citizens killed, two of whom reside in Sedalia. Our casualties not reported. Enemy, under command of Captain George Todd, numbered 108 men; moved northwest during the night. Were marauding excursion. I have sent men from the bridge to go east till they meet men from Jefferson City or are stopped by force.

Respectfully,

S. T. TRACY.

Thanks for your news. There is a force reported between Lexington and Independence, near Independence. It could hardly be the same. Lexington reports all right there. Am anxious to hear from Jefferson.
