CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Capitol two armed steamers, and one of them, as I am informed,
nearly disabled, so that she will need in a great measure to bo
rebuilt So that, in case of immediate hostilities, we have one
entire steamer, and with that we are to burn London, and though
the gentleman reauily admitted that it was possible, nay, very
probable, that New York would be burned too, yet as London
was two or three tiraes as large, we should have a great balance
oí burning on our side \ es, we weie to conquer threat Britain
and barn London and that it would be a very cheap puce for
all this to have-the city ol Newark burnt in turn, or burntfirst
And this was an argument for peace'
What else did the gentleman sayl (and what did he not say?)
He made a great argument in relation to the right of search
Oh that—that was a point never to be surrendeied Never'
No right of search existed, not even in time of war, and none in
time of peace Well, I do agree with the gentleman, partially,
on that one point, so far as to believe that there is no need of
our coming toan issue with Great Britain on that point—and
we have not as yet After reading, as Í have done, and care
fully examining, the papers put forth on both sides, I asked
mvself, what is the question between usí and I have heard men
of tbe very first intelligence say that they found themselves in
the very same situation The gentleman was guilty of a total
misrepresentation of the demand of Great Biítainia the mat
ter She has never claimed the right to search American ves
seis—no such thing on the contrary, she has explicitly dfe
claimed any such pretension, at  d that to the whole extent we
can possibly demand What is it we do demand? Not that
Great Britain shuuli dsclaim the right to search American
Vessels, but we d ny to her the light to visit and to boaid pi
rateswho hoist the Amencan flag, yes, and to search British
vessels, to , that have been declared to be pirates by the law 
of nations—pirates by the laws of Great Britain—pirates by
the laws of the United ¡states Now, it happens that behind ail
this exceeding great zeal against the right oí search is a ques
tton which the gentleman took care not to bring into view—and
that-is,the supportandperpetuation ef thcAfncan slavetrade
That is the real question between the mimsteis of America and
Great Britain—whetherslave traders, pirates by merely hoist
ins; the American flag, shall be saved from capture
I say there is no such thing as an exemption from the right of
«earch by the laws of nations, and I challenge and defy tbe
gentleman to produce the proof Thensht, in time of war, we
never have denied Nay, we have ourselves exercised the
right and the decisions ot the Supreme Court have sustained
«s in doing so and we should have a bad chance indeed with
Great Britain were it otherwise What is the right of search m
time of peace? And how has Congress, and how has the Ame
Mean Governmentfelton that subject? In 1817, when I was
about to return from England to the United fetales, Mr Wil
berforce, then a membei of the British Parliament, very cele
brated for his long and persevering exeitions to suppross the
African plave trade, wrote me a note req testing an interview
1 acceded promptly to his request and in conversation he sta
ted tome that thf* British Government had found that without
amutuil nght ofseart-h between this eountty and that upon
the coast oí Alnca it would be impossible to cany through
the s) stem she had fo-med in connection with the United States
for the suppression of that infamous tnihe I had then just
signed with my own hand a treaty declaring " the tnffic in
slaves' (not "the Atncinslave trade ')"unjustand inhuman,"
and in which both nations engaged to do all in their j>owf r to
suppress it Mr Wdberforce inquired of me whether I
thought that a proposal for a mutual, restricted, qualified
righfof search, would be acceptable to the American Govern
itient?
I had it that moment a feeling to the full ai strong agamst
tht light ot starch as it had then been exercised by  British
earner^, as ever the gen leman from Pennsylvania [Mr In
gersoll) had in ill  Ins lift    I hid been myeeif  somewhat
involved wi the question as a public man    It constituted tne
of the grounds oí my unfortunate difference with those with
whom. I hil long leui politically associated    and  it wai for
the exi rtiuns  I had mid« against the admission of that n<*ht
that 1 forfeited my plut-m the other end of the Capitol, and,
which wis >uf mteiy inore painful to me, for this 1 had differ
ed with men long  leai t > me and to whom I  ha 1  also  been
dear, insomuch that for a time it interrupted all friendly re
lations between us    Tne first thing I said, in reply to   Mi
Wilberforce   was    ' N >, you may as  well save yomselves
the trouble of making any proposals  on that subject    my
countrymen, 1 am vety sure novel wilt assent to any such
arrangemert "   He then entered into an argument, the full
force of which 1 felt, when I said to him    '^ou may, if you
think proper, make the proposal, but I think some other mode
of getting over the difliculty must be resorted to, for the pre
judicesof my country are so immovably strong on that point
that I do not believe they ever wi I ass^&U^ I returned home,
and held the situation ef-SeCTeteyy-tii&tate under the admini
stration of Mr Monroe, and was the medium through which
the proposal of the Butish Government was afterwards made.
I resisted and opposed it in the cabinet with a I my power, and,
though not a slaveholder myself, I had to resist the slaveholding
memoers of the cabinet, as well ab Mr Monroe himself, for
they were all inclined to concede the right    I maintained my
ground a-t long as I could foi there wa<; at that time a strong in
clmation m Congress also t  assent to the piof osal     Notases
sion passed but there wasa proposition to request the President
to negotiate for the correos on of thib ught oí seaich     I resist
eau to the utmost  and in private company words pa*srd be
tween mj self and a distinguished gentleman frun Virginia of so
watmakmd, that he thought it propel to allude to them in a
letter t lhisconbtituenls in which he opposed my election to the
Piesidcmy   and onf of the grounds taken aga ii«t  me at that
time was, that I was a determined   enemy t> the suppres
sion of the slave trade ant1 ai elaborate argument was made
m support of that chaise   in which reference was hid to  my
votes on  this question of a qualified ngnt of search    I state
this thaf I may set myself light tn th s subject    A gentle
mfn  who was at that time t íe leadei ol one of the parties in
this flou^e had en leav red  from yeai   tovear to | levail with
theH hi c to rcqutie of the President a conce^un of ti e right
asked  1 name him t) honor him  for he was one of the most
tal nted  I ibonous e'oqucfit  and useful men upon this floor—
I allm'e to Charles   lemon  Meicer    of \irs[inia      Sest>ion
aftei sessien he brought forwird hi^ reunion   and he con
tmued to press it until, finally in 1S32 he biou^ht the t ouse,
by yeas and nays, to vote their *>^ent to it   and strange to say,
there were but nine votes agamaf  it    The same thins; took
place m the other House, the joint resolution went to the Freei
í   aen^and he, accordingly, entered into the negotiation    It was
* utterly against my judgment and wishes, but I was obl.ged to ^
submit, andl prepared the requisito despatches to Mr Rush, then
our Minister at the Court of London^ whcrfhé made his propo
sal to Mr Canning, Mr Canning's reply was, ( Diaw up your
convention, and I will sign it "   Mr Rush d>dso,and Mr Can
mug without the slightest alteration whatever, without varying
the dot of an t, or the crossing of a t, did affix to it his signa
ture, thus as&enting to our own terms;-m out own language
The convention came back here lor ratification, but, in the
mean while, another spirit came over the feelings ol   this
House as well as- of the Senate, a party had been formed
against the administration of Mr Monro , the course of the
Administration was no longer favored, ai d the House came out
in opposition toa convention drawn m conformity to its own
previous views    In the Senate, however, all that co«ld be got
was the modification of one article     The Senate ratified the
neaty,giving the right of search in the fullest manner, to Great
Btitain, with the exception, I think, of one ^article  which ex
tended the right to the coast of the United States, that was re
jected
[Mr Ingersoll There were several changes made by the
Striate, One article was altogether struck out, another wasal
tered, and the word 'of America" were rejected, s > as to leave
only the coastof Afncaand the West Indies m the treaty
Mi I said that although a majority of the senate voted to
ratify the treaty (as altered by the Senate,) yet there was a re
Pf ectable minority opposed to it altogtther    Mr   Macon made
H*|t motion foi its rejection
"Mr Stanly    He opfosed every thing
Mr  Ingersojl     Other distinguished Senators voted   with
him, among therest, Mr Van Buren
Mr Stanly So muchthe woiseforMr Macon to be caught
in such bad company 3
I cannot say as to a word or tw o, and I am willing to take the
gentleman's statement as cotrect    Ot one thing I an sure, no
no exception was taken to the right of search, that was conce
ded fully    In consequen e of these alterations, further negotia
tion became necessaiy and, finally, the treaty was not ratified
But, as to the right of search; m the bitterness of my soul, I say
It was conceded by all the authorities of this nation    I say this,
because I am not now ftir conceding it  I hope the negotiations
now about to take  place  may be carried on without any
such concession     There has been blustering and bullying far
more than in my opinion was necessary on the subject but no
issue has yet been come to, and far less have we cometo war
about it
In this very pamphlet, of which the gentleman from Pen^yl
vama has spoken with so much honor, (and I shall treat it wi th
honor, too, as having proceeded from a public minister of ihe
ÍTnneá "States at one of the most important couitsof Europe,)
there isa proposition made which I do not say we ought to
concede As a political question involving the peace oí iwo
great countries and the suppression of the African slave trade
(for which I cannot bring myself to almost any concession ) it
might ha\e «tiong claimsto consideration, but, asa politician,
as a statesman, as a negotiator, I doubt if this expedient of Ge
ne alCassbenoleven moreobjectionablethan thf* right of search
itself
The proposal is that the cruising vessels of eithernation
should have on board a naval officer (a lieutenant I suppose)
b longing to the other and that he shall make theiequisite
search in person This is held lorthby wayofcompromist.be
tween the two parties, and as a mode of avoiding the difficulties
which embarrass the question I will not say that if the nego
tiatioo shall concentrate on this, as the only practicable expe
dient, it should be rejected, bull will say this If the gentleman
from Pennsylvania or the Senafe, or this Hsu^e shall
be so pie«sed as to concede that very little ground will
be left them foi refusing the right of search as heietofore pro
posed
But as to this question itself of the right of search, when
before was the question made a mater of such infinite ím
poitancui When, in the history of this nation was the pre
tension raised that no such right existed on the high seas'* I
will ask the Clerk to read the 54th section, I think it is of the
collection law of the United States, passed, I believe, m 1/98
oi '99
Tbe point, «aid Mr A for which I have cited this act is,
that it it here assumed that upon the high seas at four leagues
distance from the coast of the United States, you pussess and
may freely exercise the right of search This is assumed in
your revenue law, and, either by your revenue cutters or
or your véasela of war, you may search any vessel of any na
tion approaching within four leagues of your coast Look to
your laws for the suppression of the slave trade, and you find
the same thing You exercise that right now If a British
vessel freighted with slaves should come to morruw within four
leagues of any pomt of the coast, your vessels may search her,
and bring her in foi adjudication, and all the slaves on
board of her would, on then coming on shore, at once be free
Now, if this be so, what becomes of the doctune that up
on the high seas thensht of seai ch does not exist to all If,
indeed, the question should be whether the right should not
be refused to be extended beyond the distance of four league^,
and such an anule should be inserted in the convention it
would le effective, and no obiection whatever could be made
to it Give Gieat Britain tins right of search within four
leagues of the coast of Africa, and what would become of she
question about the ' Lights of nations'*" The position is fal^e
]So such light exists between nations, that they shall be ex
empted from the right of search in time of peace ' he only
authority for such a position is a declaration of Sir William
Scott, in the case of aPrench ves&el called the Louis, but even
that solitary declaration was made hypotheucalJy, and extra
judicially, it was amere dictum of that distinguished man and
not deliveied in a case which he was called to decide wmle at
the same time there is another declaration of Sir William
Grant, an authority fully equal to that of Sir William Scott
lirectly to thecontniy And this is the gentleman s authority
frtm the law of nations
I will take this occa-snn to gay in reference to the decisions
of Sir William Scott-, ti at in cases where the West Im'ia slaves
ate concerned hib decisions m recard to the n?ht of search ar^
very different from those whi^h he was in the habit of
making at the pern d of the French Revt Union He was
then a perfect scouige to oui merchants He extended his
construe ion of the law even to vessels under convoy But,
as smn as the peace took placp, and the West India plan
ters' interest was concerned, his decisions were very greatly
changed I say this with no purpose of reflecting on the
memory of that able and upright Judge a man with whom
I formerly had the happmes.  to be peisonally acquainted, as I
had with his father befoie him He was a highly amiable
manm pnvatel ie, and in conversation one of the most chaim*
mg of companions Yet, tiuili demands from me the declara-
tion, that, while all were revolted by his decisions on the bench
during the war, I have myself been quite as much so by those
made since ttr* wai in cases of West India «laves In some
cases he has gone even beyond the severity of the laws of our
own'^outhe'-n States, form one case he decided that a slave
who had once become free by having landed in Eng'and, if he
returned to his fonnei master returned at the same time to his
bondage as a slave—which is a step further than the slavehold
eis of our country have ever yet gone All his decisions, how-
ever, have snee been annulled—nullified (I do not like the
word, but it ia here appropriate) by the universal emancipation
proclaimed hy Great Britain m all her West India colonies
The deci ion of Sir William Scott is, theiefoie, no authority
and I =ay there exists none other for the gentleman's position
about the law of nations Yet, m alUhe discus, ions I haves ei
upon the subject this opinion in the ca«e of the Louis is tne
eternal burden of 'ne song, while no notice whatever is taken of
the opposite op'oion of Sir William Grant, a judicial authority
of atlea^t is mu h weight
What have I brought this question before the committee for
in this form'1 And why have I quoted the revenue law? To
show that there is no grounl whateverfor this attempt to blow
up a flame about thensht of search, for declaring that this is a
question neve -, never to be given up and to make it the burden
ot a pacific wai speech.    [A laugh ]
I do apprehend that the noble negotiator, to who«e character
and merits the gentleman from Pennsylvania has paid a just and
very h morable tribute, and who to me is an acquaintance of
nearly h ilf a century's sfandin?, whom I formerly knew as a
young man of distinguished ability then scarcely of Bge, as I
had known his father with whe m I was en the most friendly-
footing—I apprehend, I say, that this British Minister will not
take his infraction  from the honorable gentleman from Penn-
sylva n If the mode pointed out by that gentleman is the only-
mode of settling the delica e and difficult questions subsisting
between the two Governments, I think he will not take it If,
inieed I could believe that the only alternative between taking
this advice to acknowledge at once that his country has been the
aggressor on every one oí the "disputed points, and yield every
thin* that is demanded on every one oi these questions, anda
de ohtmg bloody wa~, however light sucha war may appear
in the gentleman's eyes, (which he protests it does not, but
w hich all his arguments show that it doe*,) wny then I should
despair and go honn and die, if I could Tor the gentleman may
may make as light of it as he pleases, this is no light question
with me Should the resort eventually be to war, 1 certainly have
rs lfUlepersonal interest tn Has any human being for my career
at all events, must soon close, whatever calamities may grow,
out of it either to this coun íy or to other coun tiles, (andl have
learned to feel that all my sympathies ought not to be absorbed
in one, however dear ) I can have no interest in them, looking
to myse'falune lobthute a¡> to th it amnb e little process
of the burning of L-ondnn. and New York, what interest other
gentlemen may feel in it I ctnnot piet^nd to say—and there is
many aman in this House who has a far deeper interest in it
than I have or can have but this I will say, if there is a man in.
this Hou^e who could hear the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
with that cold indifference which animated his entire speech,
(if indifference can be said to animate any thing )put the case uf
the burning of the city of I ondon as a revenge tor the previous
burning oí the city of New York without feeling a thrill of hor
ror I should wish to have liule further intercourse with that
man The burning of I > don' and the hope of that is to be a
motive foi our assuming such an a utude and pursuing such
a course as must infallibly bring us into a war' Would it
much comfort the three hu dred thousand men women, and
children who would be turned homeless m the world by the
bum ng ofNew Yoik to know that Lonc'on, with a population
four tires as gi eat, was to burn too? A fiend could hardly
bring his mind to contemplate such a thought without horror
Would it be nathmg to the people of the United States, nothing
to the civilized world nothing to the human race that two such
cities were swept from the face of the eanhi Yet the gente
man very coolly spoke of sucha consummation as by no means
impossible or improbable—he admitted that, in the event of a
war this might be one of the results
[Mr Ii.ftFRsoLL What 1 said was that a distirguished na
val officer had assured me that it would be justas easy for us
to burn London as for the British to burn New York ]
Well and that was stated as an argument why we ought to
take sut h a «nand with Great Britain as would bring us into war
wi h her I suppose the naval officer who said this was him
self eager for the distinction of sucha deed—and distinguished
he assuredly would be
[Mr Ingersoll Ye% he was, he «aid he would undertake
to do it, it necessary, and he is a man who does more thau he
says ]
Mi A resumed I remember that one of our most celebra-
ted naval officers once gave this toast ( Our country may she
be always rights but, whether right or wiong, may she always
be saccessful " This might be a very good toast for an officer
of the ni\ y Military men I admit, are not bound to enter into
the moral questions which may arise between nations, by their
commissions they are bound tn take it forgianted that their
country is in the right, when tho&e departments of their Go-
vernment to whom the right of ludgmg is consigned have so
letermmed The question of right and wrong in war, is a
question for such an assembly as this notf r the deck ef a man
of war I do not therefore disapprove of tne toast, as one to be
taken by a naval officer, but ao a moral question, to be deci
ded by a vote in th a TÍouip within ty, o months' time from this
day, 1 never would adopt the sentiment I would rathei say,
1 Our country may she a ways be successful, but, whether sue
cessful or not, may she always be in the right ' Thatisthesenti
ment wr- ch I thmk e /ery man should bung home to his heart
o qiestions so weighty and so delicate as those involved m
cur \ recent i elation*, wi*h Great Britain 'f war we must have,
oh'etu bav3 it fo*-thought and let u<? not expect the God of
bal'lesto give us success when we aiein the wrong
I hope that the idea of ourdefencelessstate, of which the gen-
tleman seemed to make so light, as being of little consequence,
and as presenting no obstacle to our going to war, because, if the
Iintishburn New York, we can burn London, will be very dif-
ferently viewed by this House, and that arguments of such a
description will have no weight here
Still less ought another argument which that gentleman pre*
«enteu to our consideration   He said that m reference to thp
