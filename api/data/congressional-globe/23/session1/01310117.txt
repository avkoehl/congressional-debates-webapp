conform their opinions to those facts and prin-
ciples   He could not say with the gentleman from
Virginia who preceded him, [Mi  Moore,] that
he belonged to no party   He d J belong to a party
which the President is supposed to have prostrated
in the dust     He had be onged, also, to the Jeffer
eon party which produced the glorious political
Revolution in this country     He belonged to that
S ate-Rights party which was said to be prostrated
in the dug', but which, like Amaius, had arisen
from the eai th with fresh strength for the struggle
The proclama'ion he considered as akm in princi-
ple to the alien and sedition laws, and fiaught with
the most high-toned Federal sentiments   But what
ihegentleman disapproved in thePresidenthe [Mr
JoMts] entirely approved—the veto of the bill re-
newing the bank chaiter   This act was the bright-
est plume in the crown of the President's glory
He had magnanimously thrown himself into the
breich, and won the approbation of posterity    It
was not his belief that the Government was in-
tended to act upon the States    He referred to the
fable of the wind and sun striving which would
strip the traveller of his cloak    1 he wmu blew,
but served only to induce the traveller to wrap his
cloak the closer around him   The sun's mild rays
toon oveicame him, and induced him voluntarily
to lay aside whatcould not be forced from him  The
moral he drew from this was, that the Government
of the United States should only be felt in kindness
by the States     Thus much he was compelled to
say to  show wherein  he agreed and disagieed
with the gentleman from Virginia   Before he pi o
ceeded to discuss the question in the mannei he
had proposed to himself, he would ask leave to
attend to a few of the preliminary remarks of the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr Dinkey ] The
gentleman informed us that but a short time ago,
from the influence of the United States Bank, the
country was in a state of unparalleled piospeuty,
commerce, agriculture, and manufactures, were all I
flourishing     But suddenly, as if touched by the '
magic wand of a wizard, all this prosDenty dis- l
appeared, and fortunate for the countiy was it, in I
Mr   Jones's opinion, that the country was so i
touched
Under the Circean enchantments of the bank, '
the country enjoyed a rl etmg and delusive pros- ]
penty     But suddenly the spell was dissolved, and
we had awakened to the  sober realities oe our I
¡situation     We found ourselves slaves, and those J
to whom the bank belongs we found to be our ,
lords and masters   He would read a few remarks |
made by a man who was now gone, but who would
long live m the veneration of his countiy, [Mr  .
John Randolph,] in his speech on granting the i
original charter of this bank    He then read fiom I
that speech a passage in which Mr Rardolph re-
marks that, if he must have a master, he would
have something 'hat he could respect    fie would i
prefer a master with epaulettes to one with a quill
behind his ear     We were to'd by the gentleman I
from Pennsylvania that, if the bank was engaged
in political schemes, if it aided in putting forth
scurrilous publications against the President, he
would be ready to join m the denunciation of the
institution.   Without stopping to inquire whether
those charges weie true or not, he would nsk the
gentleman how far, in that case, he would join in
the denunciation'    Would he simply say to the
bank, this is your only offence, and we will there-
fore overlook it for the sakeof tne good you have
done, or would hejon us in punching the bank
for malversation'   Another  observation  of the
gentleman from  Pennsylvania did  credit to  his
understanding and his heart, he referred to the
remark that, if the bank was not to be rech irtered,
nor one like it, the deposites might as well be re-
moved now as some time hence, that the bank and
the coun'ry were as well prepai ed for the removal
now as they ever would be   Mi  J hoped that no
consideration of the convenience of the bank to the
countiy in cai rying on exchange, nor any reasons
whatever would induce us to recharter the bank
if the bank wab not to be «chartered, this was the
best time that could be taken, he believed, for re
moving the deposites, and he would admit that, if
the bank was to be rechartered, this was the proper
time to restore the deposites   The restoration and
the recharter was one and the same question, for
if we restored tne deposites, it would be vainto
resist the recharter.   He, therefore, attacked the
measure at the threshold He would defend the
outposts, and then he would know that the cradel
was safe He here called the attention of the
House to the figures and calculations of the gen'le
man, which weie produced by that gentleman for
the purpose of showing the magnitude of the opei -
ations of the bank, and showed, at some length,
that the sum of the operations was greatly exag-
gerated by the enumeration of the same opeiation
several times He then passed to the argument
urged by thegentleman from Pennsylvania in favor
of the course taken by the bank to meet the pay-
ment of the deposites He tells us that the bank
was obliged to keep its specie to sustain its circu-
lation What was that circulation ? Only eighteen
millions, less than double the amount of the specie
retained in the vaults of the bank Now, he
recollected that the president of the bank said, on
oath, when the paper circulation was twenty two
millions, that live millions of specie was sufficient
to sustain it, and hence the bank had sent a part
of its specie to Europe Fie believed, with Mi
Biddle, five oi six millions in specie was sufficient
to support a cu rrency of twen' /-two millions, and
he could not believe that it nowi equired ten millions
to sustain a currency of eighteen He thought,
therefore, that the bank hid not acted solely with
a view to self-defence We aie told that the in-
dustry of the country must stop unless the deposites
be restored But there were othei causes which
had, in his opinion, contributed more to the general
distress tl an the íemoval of the deposites The
cash payment of duties, added to the reduction of
the currency by the bank, was sufficient to account
foi the pressui e upon the money market We are
told, from high ruthonty, that another cause was,
the want of confidence in the stability of the present
state of things W ho cieated this uncertainty, but
the advocates of  he restoration of the deposite '
The capital exists, whether in one bank or another,
and every one knows that the State banks are
willing to lend money on their deposites Could
any bank do moie'
M> J peifectly agreed m the opinion that
want of confidence in the permanence of the pres-
ent state of things, was the mam cause of the con-
tinuance of the pressure Let this House act,
then, and confidence will be restored Let this
House declare that the deposites shall remain
where they are
Mi J said he would call the attention of the
House to the nature of the contract made with the
bank, and, in answer to an argument put by Mr
Moore, of Virginia, contended, from the conduct
of Mr Secretary Dallas, that it was no part of the
bargain between the Government and the bank,
that the bonus of $1,520,000 was paid as a con-
sideration foi the bank having any right to the
public deposites It appeared, that in 1815, a
communication had been made by the President to
Congress, on the bubject of the currency, in con-
sequence of which a committee was raised, having
at its head Mr J C Calhoun After some de
liberation as to what remedy should be applied
to restore the currency to a sound state, the com-
mittee came to the conclusion that it was necessary
for that purpose to establish a Bank of the United
States, and the chanman was directed by the com-
mittee to ascertain the opinions of Mi Dallas,
whose financial abilities were duly estimated Mr.
Calhoun accordingly addressed him a letter, re-
questing information to which his reply was given
immediately, with that opinion upon the six foi
lowing points, viz On the amount of capital neces
sary for the bank, its government, privileges,and
duties, organization, the bonus to be paid for
granting the charter, and, lastly, such measures
as shou'd be taken by Government to aid in the
establishment of the insftution Foi the present,
it was not necessary for him to íefer to more than
what was stated in the opinion in reference to the
bonus Upon this, Mr D expressly stated " that
'it was to be paid lor the exclusive privileges to
' be gramed to the stockholders for the space of
'twenty years," and there was-nothing in it to
warrant a supposition that the right to th  depos
ites was one of the considerations for which the
bonus was paid They were rather considei ed as
an incidental benefit, for fuither on, with a pro-
phetic eye as to futunty, it would be seen that he
had expressly stated that the deposites were abso-
lutely, and almost in terms, excluded from being
so considered, for he includes,amongst others, as
advantages to be derived from the bank, the col-
lection and transfer of the public revenue, and that
of the keeping of the deposites, and there was no
claim of right, therefore, as to them, inserted in the
charter, although there was a clause by which the
bank was bound to transfer the public money as
the exigencies of the Government should make it
neeessaiy.    It might be abked, in leference to this
obligation to transfer, how could the money be
trans eired,tf there was not thereby an implied
obligation that the deposites had been previously
secured ' But he thought that this could be effected
by the Secretary of the Treasuiy—in whom the
control l y, and wanting such a transfer much—
presenting a check on tne State banks for that
purpose, and that the Bank of the United States
weie bound, under their stipulations, to make the
transfer    He, and everybody who knew Mr Cal-
houn, would acknowledge the keenness and accu-
racy with which he undeistood these matters,and
it was clear that he had not thought that the de-
posites were a part of the bargain for which the
bonus was paid, or it would have been inserted in
the charter    From this omission, he argued at
length, that the bank had not, by thecontiact.any
right to them, and contended that they would not
have been named in the charter at all, if Con-
gress had not in their discretion, by a subsequent
clause,  determined  that they  should put  some
limit to the power given by them to the Secretary
of the Treasury     It was admitted by the advo-
cates for the bank, that the Secretary had the right
to remove the deposites upon the failure of the
bank, in complying with their stipulation to trans-
fer, or to pay over the public money when demand-
ed     But if the objection to the Secretary's acting
was closely canvassed, it would appear from this
that he could not act, until after the commission of
an act by which the charter itself was violated   for
how was he to ascertain that the depository was
unsafe until he had established it by proof   Mr.
Webster, who drew the clause in the charter, never
understood that the bank had the right to hold the
deposites until proof had been made that they
weie man unsafe institution, or he would have
used other language than he did     He could not
i assent to the doctrine that the Secretary was bound
1 to satisfy the bank for the exercise of the power of
I removal vested m him by the charter, for the Sec-
| retary was only bound to satisfy the representatives
of the people, and if they were satisfied, that was
sufficient for him, as it would be altogether useless
for him to endeavor to satisfy the bank that the
deposites ought to be removed from it.  He trusted
that they would come to the conclusion that he
did, that the Secretary had the right to exercise
this power, in pursuance of the discretion vested
in him, and that the reasons rendered by him for
so doing were sufficient   He contended that there
were othei reasons  than those admitted by the
friends of the bank, which would justify the action
of the Secretary, and these were, whenever the
bank should do any act having a tendency to in-
jure the Government, to destroy the purity of elec-
tion , prevent the Government of its due influence,
or sought to make unconscionable gams at its ex-
pense, and above all, when the interests of the peo-
ple should require it    To sustain his views as to
the construction of the charter, he called the atten-
tion of the House to the recorded opinions of Mr.
Secretary Crawford, in 1817, 1818, and 1823, on
this subject, as he was, if not the ablest, certainly
mfenoi to none of his predecessois or successors
in office, and hefelt ita high gratificaron, as he had
been the fuend of his boyhood, as well as of his
maturer years, to find that he was quoted on all
sides, as one of their ablest f ranciers     These
opinions, as to the powei of the Secretary and
upon the constitutional law, had been so recently
given, it was not necessary foi him to do more
than remind the House of them     Mr. Crawford
was not alone in his opinions, for they found Mr
Secretery Ingham had reiterated the same opinions,
and 'hat he told the bank, if they should mterfeie
with the Government, or with the elections, that he
would exeicise the power now claimed     He told
Mr Biddle, in tei ms, if the bank entered the politi-
cal arena, he would exercise the power placed in
his hands    Did Mr Biddle then deny that right'
Not at all    It had been urged that this po*ei
vested in the Secretary was too great, that a ¿cite
