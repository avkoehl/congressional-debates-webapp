APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August, 1841.
Sfrfi Co*f&. .. 1st Sess.
Veto Message—Mr. Rives.
Senate,
ceded, with a high degree of probar íhty that if the dissent were
expressed no branch would be introduced
The last proviso to which ihe President l&fers is in these
words "And provided, nevertheless, That whenever it shall
become necessary and proper to  carrying into execution any
of the powers granted by the Constitution, to estab ish an office
of offices in any of the States whatever, and the establishment
thereof shailbedirectedbylaw, itsfiallbetheduty ot the said
directors to establish such office or offices accordingly "
This proviso was intended to reseive a power to Congress to
compel the Bank to establish branches, if the establishment of
them should be nec*«sary to the great purposes of this Govern
ment, notwithstanding the dissent of a Sute If, íor example,
aState had once unconditionally dissented to the establishment
of a branch, and afterwards assented, the Bank could not have
been compelled, without this reservation of r owei, to establish
the branch, however urgent the wants of the Treasui y might be
The President, I think, ought to have itcn m the form and Ian
guage of the proviso, the spirit of conciliation m which it was
drawn, as I know It does not assert the pow er, it em ploys the
language of the Constitution itself, leaving every tne free to
interpret that language according to his own sense of the in
str u ment
Why was it deemed necessaiy to ''peak of its beu g "the Ian
guage of the master to the vassal," of this iron rut ," that
Congress wills, and submission io demanded']" What is this
whole Federal Government but a mass of power  abstracted
froai the sovereignty of the severa! mates, and wielded by an
organized Government foi their comm n defence ami general
welfare, accoidmg to the giants of die Constitution? 1 hef e
powers are necessarily su pi erne, the Constitution, the arts <f
Congress, and treaties, beinffbo deilared by the expiess words
of the Constitution Whenever, therehie, th.s Government
acts within the powers granted to it by the Constitution, sub
mission and obedience are due fiom nil fmrn States, as well as
from persons And if this present the midge of a master and a
vassal, of State subjection and Congressional domination it is
the Constitution, created or consented to by the Scatea that or
daios these relations Nor can it be said m tho contingency
supposed, that an actof Congress has íepeiiedan act oí Mate
legislation undoubtedly, m case of a c~  flirt between > State
Constitution, or State law, and the Constitution of the United
States, or an act of Congress passed in p irsuance of it the
State Constitution or Stale law would yield Hut it could not
at least be formally or technically said that the tetare Constitu
tion or law was repealed its operation would be suspended or
abrogated by the necessary pi edominanceof the paramount au
thorny
The President seems to have irgirded as obitctmnalle that
provision in the clause which declaies ihu % hianrh üein oí ce

val'eJ virtues and everglonous pub'ic services of George
Washington, I must be perin* cdto say iba'he has not gene-
ia!ly been considered as helor sing to that "Uepubhcan" party
to which the "Resident all jd?
We are told however, ot the example of Afr Madison, which,
it is said, Prf 1 lent Tyler must have had p trticularly in mind
when he penned this passage I have already adverted to
Mr ^ladiso 1 a views in íelation to a National Bmk m 1791,
views which never were retracted by him till 1S15 but the Se
nator ttlis-us the í resident raferred to his conduct m sant tinn-
ing by his signature the charter of the second Bank of the United
State  as t! it example by wh|ph he was himself to be go
veined How does that example apply to the present case?
Look at the letter wn ten by JWr Madi&on to &r Ingets >II in
explanatu n of that act, and let any candid man say what is
the deducuon fanlv to be drawn from it It is this that Mr
Madisun had changed his opinion Not thathestnl believed a
Bank unc ui« tutional and so Relieving, signed tie bill, but
that his o[ imon a5? to 119 un< onstituiiona iry had undergt ne a
change foi, in the very first piragiaphoi that letter hesajs
that l c co isidered 'the constitutionality of the Btnk as sus-
tained bv the con^i leration4?' which he proceeds to detail I
refer the Senator to the let er itself But that is not all Be-
fore we condemn President lyler, undei existing circum-
¡stances, fot pu un" hito negative on wlnt he bel eves to be
against the. Constitution he las sworn to support, let those
circum«taores be compaied with the cneumstances under
which Mi M^dism actel In the letter to RIi ingpisoll, Mr
Madison s i\>5 trie obh^atoiy force of preceder "* in nierpretmg
the Consu ution,dtnends amongothei things, on the prospect
wh ch thcie may be of a change of constiuction by the public
ot k* aeent& " Th  consutuuonahtv of a Bank had, at the
time of Mr Madison's ac ion upon it bten aonually recogmsed,
as he says, for twenty years successively—the whole nation
hid acqu esced m it arid th< re was no prospect of any change
of opinion I yield to no one in profound inspect for the prtn
ciph s and t haracter of Mr Madison and I hive ever been dis
#osed to make every alhuatKo íor tho course he ft it it hisdu y
to pursue L^ÉjÉne read a &e iteiue or two from us letter to
Mr In^ersoll   fW^
