OFFICE OF THE CHIEF QUARTERMASTER,

June 13, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER,

Warrenton Junction:

The Reserve Brigade got 375 horses yesterday. I sent 160 men, Second and Third Divisions, as escort to Reserve Artillery. Colonel Gamble is receiving orders from Colonel Devin direct, or should have cleaned out Stafford, Point Pleasonton, and First Division camps to-day and to-morrow. Have requisitions in for ordnance stores sufficient to equip every dismounted man at Potomac Creek, now 500, which stores should be at hand to-day and to-morrow, and it horses arrive as freely as for some time past, a few days will place all these people with their commands.

A. J. COHEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

General Hooker will change his base of supplies from the road to the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, with depot at Alexandria. The Aquia Creek depot will be abandoned so soon as the sick and wounded and public property can be removed - say by Monday next. The pontoon bridge over the Rappahannock will be withdrawn to-night, and the corps not already on the march will be put in motion. The general headquarters will be at Dumfries tomorrow night. Colonel Sawtelle will superintend affairs at Aquia Creek, and take all employees and property to Alexandria. I shall go with the trains when not with General Hooker. Though the movement will be hurried, and our forces somewhat scattered at first, I still apprehend no loss. I will keep you advised.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac.
