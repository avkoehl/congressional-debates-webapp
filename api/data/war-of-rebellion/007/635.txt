in working order. Colonel Smith, of the Thirteenth Ohio, reports the locomotive on the track, which was struck by one of our shells, can be repaired in a single day. One or two others I hope may be found worth repairing.

LOUISVILLE, February 19, 1862

Major-General HALLECK;

I have seen message to General Buell. Do you mean that his whole command should go from Bowling Green to Clarksville, or that the general in person should go to the Cumberland and take command of forces now there, his own column from Bowling Green to co-operate with Cumberland column, in such manner as he (Buell) may decide, to clear out the Cumberland, including Nashville? Answer definitely, the points as stated in this message. The general desires to meet your views fully. Answer immediately.

Assistant Secretary of War.
