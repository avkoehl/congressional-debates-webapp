lion of the Senatot fion Kentucky was, nni that
we should now act ,11 obedience to the will, and in

the people on this subject, but that the pe iple
should have ano h-=i oppor unit) ofexnressn-o t e r
sentiments, by leavirg the qt.estion of bank o, no
bank untouched for the piesent, so that b, again
agitating and investigating the subject, pubhc *ci,-
t'ment might, at some future peuod, le mou ded
into, and assume a diffeient shape, a id be more
favorably inclined to a bank But his cpnuon
was, that that periol would nevei occur, ano ich
an event would never happen, when a imj ity of
the peop'e would be m favor of a United Slates
Bank. To adopt the resolut on voild be, m
eifee*, to undertike to etpiess an opm on as

He had de*erm ned to vote aga list the propos tton
of tne Senator ficm Kentuckj, andas this niicht
have the appearance of giving a vote aga nst the
voice oí the people, he w as desirous of accompam -
ing his vote with his reasons fur it lie had risen,
for the puipose of giving his opinion frank'y, and
he would now slate, that he was wholly and en-
t íely, on constitutional grounds, oppo;°d to a Bank
of the United States It was his deliberate opinion,
too, that the people did not want a bank. lie
would, therefore, vote against any pro¡ osdion which
stated that it now \va=, or would heieafki be, ev-
pedient to establish a Bank of the United Stat"s
Mr ROANE said that the moment had inosi
unexpectedly air'ved vihsn he found himself con-
Stiouned to say a few won's to the Senate, lie
was as jet but little acquainted with tne rules oí
that honoiablp bidy, nor was he veis^d in pari a-
mentary law. The subject as now piesented to

The amendment now before us lequnes us to
declare that a majority of the p op!e of the United

He, foi one, declaitd that he knew not what weie
the opm.ons of the people of the United States on
this subject That bodv had not, in his opinion,
that question, in any maimei, befoie them, and it
thej had, had not, a,s Le conceived, the *p=timony
to enal le them to pass a solemn ji dginent on it.
He did not himself believe that such is their opi-
nion—veij farfiomit Whenever theie was a large
majoi itj of the people of the United Slates df mann-
ing a national bank, he had no douM but that thev
wou'd have one, but not «.th his consent given heie
or e'sewhere and this bungs me, Mr Picsident,
to declare, that a"5 long as I occupv a seat on this
floor, I shall nevei acknowledge but two cideua
by which my vot s aie to be controlled The one
is thr will—the known, asceitamed will—of a
majority of those who sent me here—my
constituents The other, the dictates of i,iy
ov n conse ence The opinion, then, ot tne
majo.ity—naj, of all the people oí the Unded
States, and oí all the Senavois en this floor—
wou'd not control hun, as loig as his const tu-
ci is were opposed to a ba lk In Older th t
he might not, b possibility , be m sunder->tood bj
any of the votes le might give on Ihe amend
rrents now offti<>d—lest he m,u fall mto seme
oí the "traps ' w men had leen spoken of, if indeed
anv 1 ave bepn set—he would lie oceasion to go
furthei, and declaie thai if, instead of being a mem-
bti of the Senate of the U.11 ed St lies, adrmi'^eim"
I end cemsimwig oui present Coostitutio", he w as a
membei of a conv enüon of the people of the U'ntPei

a bank, as composing one of its features Ne, sir
ne-ver, with my consent, shall a powe- so potent,
ei hei foi good or evil, constitute a feature in thj
Republic under which I live.
Mr Piesidenl, if there aie any pai'iamentary
" traps" set—if th«re is any unfairness going on, I
•know nothing of it.   What is the state of the ease ?
