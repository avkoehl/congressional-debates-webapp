come to the State of Tennessee or Kentucky if their homes are in those States. Will send your telegram of this date in regard to vegetables, &amp;c., to Sanitary Commission. Also have telegraphed Paymaster-General in regard to pay. He says that the whole army will be paid up to date as soon as he can get the funds. General Grant does not approved of sending the whole of your command to Texas, but the designs that you should remain in Georgia with about 2,000 cavalry and some infantry (he does not say how much) in command of the State, I take it. He also mentioned that you could send about 1,000 cavalry to South Carolina, but has not given the order. The remainder of your cavalry is to come to Tennessee, to be mustered out and reorganized-those whose term expires before 31st of October to be mustered out, the remainder, to be consolidated into maximum regiments, taking men from the same States to fill up regiments. A portion of these will be turned over to General Sheridan and the remainder distributed to aid in restoring law and order in Kentucky, Alabama, and Mississippi.
