anchor in position below so as to command the railroad? The operations of the enemy in the vicinity of Columbus should be closely watched and care taken to prevent a surprise.

Major-General.

PADUCAH, KY., March 6, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

General Grant right. I have just learned that a large force of rebels have collected at Eastport or at the bridge near there and also at Corinth. Force estimated at 20,000; engaged fortifying at both places. Now he says has boats enough for whole grand command. I will send for General Smith to Savannah all the Paducah garrison. When am I to go? I prefer General Smith's column.

Brigadier-General SHERMAN, Paducah, Ky.:

Major-General GRANT, Fort Henry, Tenn.:

General Sherman may join General Smith's column. General Smith must advance with great caution. If the enemy is in force at Corinth or Eastport, our landing must be below. I agree with General Grant that water batteries at Fort Donelson should be dismounted and captured field artillery sent to Paducah or Cairo.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

PADUCAH, KY., March 6, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Captain Rawlins, General Grant's adjutant-general, says General above, sixteen regiments, four broken regiments at Fort Donelson, two regiments at Clarksville, but will be at Fort Henry to-day. Plenty of boats at Fort Henry. I send up six more steamers to-day, loaded with troops, and will have as many more to-morrow. Three regiments are coming around from Clarksville to Fort Henry by water. There are ten batteries with General Grant's army now. There is one battery here; shall I send it up also?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General.

CAIRO, March 6, 1862-12 m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

March 4, the enemy had 20,000 men at Corinth, Miss.; 10,000 at Henderson, 25 miles from Corinth; and 8,000 at Bear River Bridge, near Alabama line, and where daily receiving re-enforcements from Columbus, from Louisiana, and from other points. They will probably make decided stand there, and require a large army well managed to beat them
