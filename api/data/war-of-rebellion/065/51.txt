Troops were all landed during the night,and advanced a mile and at half to Legare's plantation, where we remained until daylight, July 3, when we advanced, skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry for about 5 miles,when they retreated across the bridge, taking it up behind them. Our lines were immediately advanced to the bank of the creek and attempt made to cross. I was ordered by General Birney to the left of the line to communicate with the fleet and General Foster. The following are the messages received and transmitted:

---- ----:

Anything to communicate?

---- ----.

---- ----:

We have found a battery of rifled guns. We are trying to flank it.

---- ----.

---- ----:

How is it going?

---- ----.

General FOSTER:

They have a squadron of cavalry, with a light battery on the other side of deep creek; only approach commanded. We are trying to flank them. Your shells are bursting in our lines. Lengthen your fuses. Our whole force is on right side of road. Shall cross if possible. All bridges destroyed. Ammunition most gone for howitzers. Our skirmishers are as near as we can get. Two wounded.

BIRNEY,

General.

General FOSTER:

We have a boat and will cross creek as soon as possible.

BIRNEY,

General.

General BIRNEY:

Cross if possible.

FOSTER,

General.

General FOSTER:

I think I shall be ready to storm the battery by 10 o'clock. Troops are thrown to the right seeking a place to cross.

BIRNEY,

General.

General FOSTER:

Crossing impossible, except directly in face of battery, six guns; creek 10 rods wide, mostly swamp; boats useless; could not trust these troops to make the assault. We are on an island and cannot flank. Advise the withdrawal from this point.

BIRNEY,

General.

General BIRNEY:

Keep your present position and do all you can all day. You will withdraw under cover of the night. I will place the guns-boats to cover your embarkation.

FOSTER,

General.

We retained our position until after day, when the troops were silently withdrawn and were all embarked by 1 o'clock a.m., July 4,and we moved from the river inside the bar. At daylight crossed the bar and proceeded to Stono River and moved up the river opposite James Island, July 4, 1864.

General BIRNEY:

Land you troops as fast as possible, using all your boats, and join General Schimmelfenning.

FOSTER,

General.
