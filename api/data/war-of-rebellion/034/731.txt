down. I think you will have a good chance to catch Morgan at last. Hobson ought to be close onto his heels. Telegraph often and fully.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 12, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

There are no troops at Lawrenceburg, and no officer of rank. I have sent steamers there to take on the soldiers for Madison, but have telegraphed them not to leave there until I telegraph. Will telegraph you more fully soon. What time will the troops now leaving for Lawrenceburg be there?

A. E. BURNSIDE.

JULY 12, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

I have just sent the following to Governor Morton, in answer to a dispatch:

JULY 12, 1863.

Governor MORTON, Indianapolis:

Dispatch received. As soon as General Love is satisfied that General Hobson has arrived in the neighborhood of Vernon, in pursuit of Morgan, he should move his forces east, by rail, to Vernon. If 500 re-enforcements have gone to Madison, as Willcox telegraph, and Wallace about to start with 2,500 more, that place will be amply strong, and Love would be better at Vernon than any other place, because he could the move east, west, south, or north, as circumstances require. I have so telegraphed Willcox.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

If you are satisfied that the whole of Morgan's force is all east of Vernon, Hughes should be ordered up to Seymour with his main force, leaving guards at the bridges.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

General BOYLE:

There is a report from the operator at La Fayette that a large force of rebels had crossed again at Brandenburg, marching on Corydon, and that Palmyra was in flames. Is not this bogus?

I have to report that one of my regiments is engaged with the rebel force at Sumner, on the Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad, which is probably same detachment sent to burn and cut road. The last reliable information of their main force was that they were marching on Aurora.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

JULY 12, 1863-1.45 p.m.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

Send on to Lawrenceburg the other regiment at the earliest possible moment; we will communicate with them on the road. Have the four guns loaded, and I will telegraph you, before 5 o'clock, whether to send them or not.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
