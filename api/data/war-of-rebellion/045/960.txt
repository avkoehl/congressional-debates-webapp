SOUTH ANNA BRIDGE, July 3, 1863.

General ELZEY:

They are said to be advancing from Littlepage's Bridge in large cavalry force, for which I am ready. Colonel Cunningham was sent up here yesterday with 300 men without ammunition, and have but little yet. Please have some sent up.

The Secretary of War telegraphs me he would send 500 men to re-enforce me; hurry them up. I wish to give Colonel Spear, if he comes with cavalry only, a coup de main.

E. D. HALL,

Colonel, Commanding.

JULY 3, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War, C. S. A.:

Since writing to you, I have received the inclosed from General Elzey.
