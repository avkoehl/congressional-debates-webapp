GENERAL: Two deserters from Perry's brigade (now Finegan's), Eighth Florida Regiment, came into our lines about 7 o'clock last evening. They bring no important information. As far as they know the enemy's position remains unchanged. They report that the enemy are sinking shafts, either mining or countermining, at a point very near the Jerusalem plank road and on the part of the line occupied by Finegan's (Florida) brigade.
