By order of the Secretary of War:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SPRINGFIELD, February 8, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Volunteers are coming in rapidly from all parts of the State. This morning Colonel Oakes informs me that the Government will not pay transportation because second Lieutenants have not been mustered conditionally to enlist recruits before arrival here. I do hope

you will remove this difficulty, as it is of the first importance to the State to go on collecting troops. Three thousand are now in camp; as many more waiting transportation. I call your attention to a communication from Assistant Adjutant-General McKeever, dated December 19, 1864, received to-day.

RICHARD J. OGLESBY.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, February 8, 1865.

Governor OGLESBY,

Springfield, Ill.:

Your telegram of this date is very gratifying. Colonel Oakes has been instructed as you desire. I have called for McKeever's communication and will see to it. Let me know if any Government officer obstructs or hinders you, or fails in his duty, and a prompt remedy will be administered.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., February 8, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Your dispatch is entirely satisfactory. Colonel Oakes is very cordial and accommodating; aids me in every what that he can.

R. J. OGLESBY,

Governor.
