From the commencement of the campaign the troops under my command marched and fought almost cosnstantly. They had npot had a single day's rest since the 2nd of May. Their conduct was such as to merit the highest praise. They encountered the dangers, privations, and fatigues incident to such arduous and perilous services with unshaken fortitude and intrepid valor.

Major-General Birney, commanding Third Division, and Brigadier-General (now Brevet Major-General) Barlow, commanding First Division, are entitled to high commendation for the valor, ability, and promptness displayed by them during the operations included in this epoch of the campaign. The magnificent charge made by their division, side by side, at Spotsylvania, on the 12th of May, stands unsurpassed for its daring, courage, and brilliant success. Brigadier General (now Major General) John Gibon, commanding Second division, and Brigadier-General (now Brevet Major-General) Mott, who commanded the Fourth Division until it was consolidated with Birney's division, merit high praise for the manner in which they handled the troops commanded by them. Brigadier-General (now Brevet Major-General) Webb, commanding First Brigade, Second Division, was severely wounded whole gallantly leading his troops at Spotsylvania, on the 12th of May. Colonel (now Bvt. Major General) John R. Brooke, Fifty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers, then commanding Fourth Brigade, First Division, performed marked and conspicuous services during the battle of the Po, May 10, and at Spotsylvania, May 12. Colonel (now Brevet Major-General) Milles, Sixty-first New York Volunteers, performed marked and distinguished services, especially at the Catharpin road on the 8th, at the battle of the Po on the 10th, and at Spotsylvania on the 12th and 18th of May. Colonel Coons, Fourteenth Indiana Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel D. L. Stricker, Second Delaware Volunteers, and Lieutenant-Colonel Merriam, Sixteenth Massachusetts Volunteers, three brave and able officers, were killed while leading their men into action during the storming of the enemy's works at Sportsylvania on the morning of the 12th of May. Many other gallant officers and soldiers of my command exhibited rare and conspicuous valor and devotion during the battle described in this report, whose names are unmentioned here, owing to the almost total absence of detailed reports from my subordinate commanders. Lieutenant Colonel (now Brigadier General) C. H. Morgan, my chief of staff, deserves especial men-
