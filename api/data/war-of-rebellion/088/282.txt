HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,August 18, 1864-9 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that nothing unusual has transpired on my front during the last twelve hours. General Potter, commanding Second Division, reports the enemy's picket-line strengthened during the day. The left of my line was swung rotund this p. m., as ordered. It was found impossible, on account of distance, to connect with the Fifth Corps. There is an interval of a mile, which is picketed by the Third New York Cavalry. General White, commanding First Division, reports that the commanding officer of his right brigade reports the enemy's force in his front moving to our left, they having been relieved by troops from the right.

General Mott's division is between 5,000 and 6,000 strong. The commanding general desires you to send that number of your troops to General Warren. General Ord has some 1,500 men in reserve that can dispense with. I will telegraph him to send them to you at once and that will relieve more of your troops that should go to Warren as soon as practicable. Please let him know where he shall send them.
