APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

41st Cons....2d Sess.
Finance—Mr. Ingersoil,
IIo. of Reps.
become a law; and now it would give me equal
pleasure, and I doubt not the country also,
should my substitute to the pending bill be-
come a law, which provides for the issuing of
$44,000,000 of greenbacks to take the place of
those which were "contracted" and burned
under Secretary McCulloch. Thiswould afford
great relief to the languishing industries of the
whole country.
At the close of the war the people were pro-
fitably employing not less than $1,000,000,000
of currency. Within two years the suicidal
policy of contraction had reduced this sum to
about seven hundred and fifty million dollars,
and this reduced sum was required to answer
the additional demands ?s a circulating me-
dium of the ten States, with their eight million
people lately in rebellion. Is it any wonder
then, Mr. Speaker, that under such a policy
that tlieie should have been a universal shrink-
age of production and prices, and a general
feeling of "goneness" in all portions of the
country ?
In addition to the evils of contraction, the
people have been compelled to submit to the
additional evils imposed upon them by the
policy of the Treasury Department, as admin-
istered by Mr. McCulloch and Mr. Boutwell
in forcing down the price of gold by their
unwise and injudicious sales of coin and the
purchase of bonds with the proceeds of such
sales.
Notwithstanding it may be true that by the
figures of the Department it can be shown that
the interest-bearing debt has been reduced
about $100,000,000 within the past year, I am
firmly of opinion that this reduction of the
debt, and in that way, has cost the producers
of the country at least §200,000,000 in the
decreased price of their products. While the
Treasury may be $100,000,000 better off, the
people are at least $200,000,000 worse off.
Those at the head of public affairs have too
much solicitude for the condition of the Treas-
ury and not enough for the condition of the
people. If they would but see to it that the
condition of the people be prosperous the
Treasury will take care of itself.
These two policies to which I have referred
must be reversed, and the people have it in
their power to reverse them; and I believe and
trust the day is not far distant when it will be
done. Our population is constantly increasing
at the rate of three per cent, per annum, and
the power of our producing capacity is increas-
ing iti a much greater ratio, owing to the many
labor-saving inventions of our ingenious peo-
ple, while the currency of the country is con-
stantly decreasing. The people are required
under this condition of things to get along as
best they can with less money, while their de-
mands and uses for money are daily increasing.
The result of this condition of things must
inevitably be hard times. The great mass of
the people must be the sufferers. There are
always a few who fatten upon the misfortunes
of the many. Capitalists who have money to
loan want money scarce and the rate of inter-
est high; and if money is scarce it must be
dear and the rate of interest high. Those who
are the fortunate possessors of the gold inter-
est bearing bonds of the United States, and
from this source derive an income, would be
benefited by "hard rimes;" for then their gold
would buy double the labor and double the
amount of the farm products that can be bought
for the same amount of money at the present
time. These money-loaner3 and these men
who live on fixed incomes all belong to the
party of " on to specie payments." There is
but or.e way to thwart their schemes, and that
is to have the Government issue more money,
more legal tenders, to make money plenty.
Then the rate of interest would bo low; the
occupation of the Sbylocks would be gone;
the whole country would then resound with
the hum of industry; an era of general pros-
perity would dawn upon, us, and this grand
Republic would move grandly on to fulfill its
sublime destiny.
Any narrow, pinched, and niggardly financial
policy will inevitably dwarf us. Money, like
any other commodity, is governed by general
laws. Tts value is regulated by the supply and
demand. Money in the single city of New York
is abundant; hence on call loans it is quite
cheap—from five to seven per cent.; while
almost in every other section of the country
the demand is great, while the supply is very
limited; hence ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five,
and even higher rates of interest are obtained.
Money—and when 1 speak of money I do not
mean "wild cat," or such paper money as was
at the same time the disgrace and ruin of our
people but I mean that kind of money issued
by the Government and indorsed by the whole
people—the best money, in my judgment, ever
created by the genius of man. This kind of
money should be issued by the Government
until the interest on money in all portions of
the country on undoubted and unquestioned
security should not rule at a higher rate than
five or six per cent, per annum.
The demand for money in our country at
this time has, perhaps, never been equaled in
any other country. France, with comparatively
small extent of country and well developed,
employs of circulating medium twenty-seven
dollars per capita of its entire population.
Great Britain, with thirty millions of population,
with less extent of territory than E'rance, and
even more fully and perfectly developed, em-
ploys of circulating medium, not including
bank credits, checks, or bills of exchange,
twenty-two dollars per capita for its entire
population; while the United States, with a
population of about forty-two millions, with
an almost unlimited extent of territory, and
that, too, in the infancy of its development,
employs of circulating medium or currency not
above seventeen dollars per capita.
The building of our railroads from the At-
lantic to the Pacific and from the great lakes
and the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico;
the development of our resources in all the
States and Territories by an active, intelligent,
and energetic people, requires, in my judg-
ment, more money per capita than any other
nation on earth. We have, and are capable
of producing, the raw material for almost all
the known industries. We have everything,
except a suffieent supply of money, and in that
we are lamentably deficient.
Mr. Speaker, when I reflect upon these facts
and the general condition of our country I am
amazed that the people, in whom all power
resides and from whom all the powers of our
Government spring, should suffer this condi-
tion of things longer to continue. They will
not always be deceived and controlled by those
whose interests are directly antagonistic to
their own. They will "reason together," and
take counsel of their own judgment, and they
will drive the " money-changers " out of their
temple. There are those among us who believe
in the policy of keeping money dear and mak-
ing labor cheap. This is a heartless policy;
and tends to make the " rich richer and the poor
poorer." I believe in the reverse of this. I
believe in making money cheap and labor dear;
and this policy, while it will not make the rich
poor, will elevate and alleviate the condition
of the poor; and while I have a voice in pub-
lic affairs I shall vote and work for this. Money
under this policy can never be the master of
the people, and labor will be emancipated from
the control of capital.
Before quitting this branch of the subject I
desire to submit for the consideration of the
House a table which shows the amount of
currency, including bank notes, legal tenders,
and specie, in circulation in 1830, and in each
year from the year 1836 to the year 1869, which
I send to the Clerk's desk to have read.

Mr. INGFRSOLL. From a careful examina-
tion of this table, Mr. Speaker, it will appear
that in 18S0 the circulation amounted to $7 20
per capita for our entire population, and that
the circulation was gradually increased to the
year 1837, when it amounted to fourteen dollars
per capita. This period will be remembered as
being one of commercial activity and general
prosperity. Then followed the panic of 1837,
and from that period to 1843 was one of contrac-
tion, at which time the circulation amounted to
only $6 90per capita. It is hardly necessary
for me to remark that this period, from 1837 to
1843, was one of great depression. From 1843
to 1857 the currency was an expanding one, and
by the year 1857 had risen to §10 70 per capita.
This was a period of activity. Immense strides
had been takem in the extension of our com-
merce, both internal and external, and in the
extension of our railroad system. In fact, it was
a period of general development and improve-
ment. In 1857 came the great crash, which
prostrated almost every interest and cost the
country hundreds of millions of dollars; and
this retrograde movementeontinued until 1861,
when the rebellion broke out, at which time
the currency amounted to only $13 70 per
capita.
The necessities of the war compelled Con-
gress to pass the legal-tender act February 25,
1863, and soon thereafter several hundred mil-
lions of this legal tender was added to the cur-
rency of the country. On the 25th of February,
18G3, the act providing for the establishment
of national banks became a law; and through
this agency a vast increase was given to the
volume of the currency. So much had-the
currency been increased that we find, in 1864
and 1805, the currency of the country amounted
to over twenty-eight dollars per capita. From
the commencement of the war to this period,
it will be remembered, was one of unexampled
activity and prosperity, and, barring the war,
it may be said that these were the most glorious
days of the Itepublic. From 18GC to the pres-
ent time has been one of contraction; hence
it has been a period of general depression. We
are on the "down grade," and the down grade,
if continued long enough, ends in bankruptcy.
Mr. Speaker, I have dwelt thus long on these
facts because 1 desired to establish beyond
controversy that without exception periods of
expansion are periods of activity and progress,
and that periods of contraction are periods of
lethargy and depression. I have been asked, it
periods of expansion are so beneficial, why
have they ended in financial panics? To this
I answer, it was not because of the expausion
