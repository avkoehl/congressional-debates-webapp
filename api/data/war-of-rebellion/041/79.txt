JUNE 6.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The shelling of the mortar-boats on Thursday night was reported to have seriously inconvenienced the enemy. Beef-cattle killed, and wounded many, and rendered a regimental camp untenable. The bulk of the shot passed a little to the left and beyond the main magazine. The sleep of half of the garrison was prevented.

BANKS,

General.

General BANKS:

I have him under my control. The minute he opens, I silence him.

Admiral.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Your note of yesterday received. The sextant has arrived; it will be taken care of and returned safely. Much obliged with your offer in regard to the boats in Bayou Sara. We heard of their safety yesterday, but would like particulars. Thanks for the hand-grenades.

BANKS,

General.

General BANKS:

Hammering and building is reported at the mouth of Thompson's Creek. Can you account for it?

FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

We have men near by the creek, and will report to you. All going well.

BANKS,

General.

SPRINGFIELD LANDING, June 9.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Colonel Prince has been to-day to the mouth of Thompson's Creek, on the east bank, and reports neither hearing nor seeing anything of the enemy in that neighborhood. Our picket line is complete to the captured steamboats, whence it is extended by frequent patrols beyond the steamboats to the river. The crossing of Thompson's Creek is reported impracticable. We burned the enemy's store-house this afternoon.

BANKS,

General.

JUNE 9.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Opened fire at 11 a. m. from the heavy guns and mortars, and fired slowly during the day, with good range and excellent effect, driving the enemy away from the parapet. Our fire was, except in one or two cases, unanswered. The navy guns were admirably served. Please keep up your mortar fire during the whole of the night. We shall fire slowly all night. We will send you a report of the operations at the mouth of Thompson's Creek this evening.

BANKS,

General.
