troops on the line of the Arkansas, and every blow that we attempt to strike him on this line in its and the troops' present condition costing the Government fully three times as much as the damage to the enemy could amount to were it with results most favorable, I shall abandon all further efforts at present, unless otherwise ordered by yourself or General Curtis. It is by belief that General Shelby's command, nearly 10,000 men, have gone back to the White River, near Batesville and Jacksonport, from whence he started on his raid with the view of spending the winter there. It is certain that a very large number of his men have gone there. A military post should be established and maintained at Batesville or Jacksonport. Either position is more important so far as this department is concerned than Little Rock.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Cassville:

Mrs. Bond has very little to tell. She left Yellville October 31. A few of Schnable's men were in the White River valley. Harrell's men were in Rolling Prairie; Thompson's men in Carroll County; says there were no more than 400 men in the whole country. None of Price's army had returned from Missouri save a few stragglers. Heard when she left that Price was going into Texas, and that Cooper and Stand Watie, with 1,700 men and three small cannon, were to join him at the river. This is all I can learn from her and she is very indefinite and knows but little. Says her horse was taken from her. No news.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Cassville, Mo.:

Major Cosgrove reports that one of the Seventy-third Enrolled Missouri Militia has been hung by Confederate soldiers with a log chain, and recommends retaliation. May I order one of the prisoners here into close confinement and refer the matter to the general commanding? Major Cosgrove is quite unwell, and Captain Chitwood commands at Lebanon at present.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Captain Chitwood reports that the home guard companies at Lebanon and at the Gasconade are breaking up and going home, and that he has not men enough to follow them. He desires instructions. One company of the militia is deserting also.
