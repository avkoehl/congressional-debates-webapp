CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY,

Savannah, November 21, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

DEAR SIR: Every car at this time is engaged bringing prisoners from Camp Lawton. The very instant I can command cars I will place a train at Numbers 13 for Government stores, and I will give directions immediately thereafter to bring down the stores at Millen. Our road is not injured as yet from Gordon down. I received the following from Augusta, from our operator at Gordon, written yesterday:

The lumber train was captured at Griswoldville and burned today. Negroes all safe. Destroyed the machine shops and foundry and Georgia Chemical Works. Road burned at Griswoldville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. R. CUYLER,

President.
