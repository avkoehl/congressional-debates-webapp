Ferry, where it will cross the Tennessee to co-operate with Hooker.

The force which will cross at Brown's Ferry to occupy the mamelon, at the mount of Lookout Valley, will consist of three brigades, of which the first,under Hazen, will proceed to the spot in the pontoons, of which the bridge to be thrown across there will be composed. The other two march, the distance being about 4 miles, and all are to be on the ground before daylight Tuesday morning.

This expedition to Lookout Valley will probably be commanded by General Smith. Reconnaissance yesterday showed the rebels have only a cavalry picket at Brown's Ferry, and no force on the mamelon. Cold; cloudy; no rain.

CHATTANOOGA, October 25, 1863-11 p.m.

Careful inquiry through the army discloses nothing but general satisfaction at recent changes. Officers generally feel that continuance of Rosecrans in command was the destruction of the army, and no men could be found in whom all would feel so much confidence as in Thomas and Grant.

Howard now occupies Shellmound, and has found one locomotive and three freight cars on the railroad there in working order. We have rebel papers to the 23d. Jeff. Davis was at Selma on the 18th. He unqualifiedly sustains Bragg. Returns from Georgia election show that in 105 counties only 25,800 votes were cast, including the army vote. All complain loudly of scarcity of provisions, and predict terrible suffering among the poor during the coming winter. Pleasant.

BRIDGEPORT, October 26, 1863-2 p.m.

The movement for the occupation of Raccoon Mountain and Lookout Valley was to have begun this morning. Everything is ready at Chattanooga,and Palmer will be at Rankin's Ferry in season, but Hooker is behindhand and it is postponed till to-morrow. The forces sent from here are Howard's two divisions and Geary's, 10,000 men in all.

Our advices from Lookout indicate that the rebels have withdrawn from the valley and from the top of the mountain, keeping only a small force at Steven's and Cooper's Gaps and Nickjack Trace. Their pickets were also much diminished last evening at the foot of the mountain on the Chattanooga side. They have gone up the railroad after Burnside on the west. The steam-boat building here will be ready to run within three days. Cloudy; rain threatened.
