ISSUE OP TREASURY NOTES.
Mr, CHANDLER. I move to take up the joint
resolution offered by me yesterday morning.
The motion was agreed to; and the joint reso-
lution (S. No. 91) prohibiting the further issue of
Treasury notes, and for other purposes, was read
the second time, and considered as in Committee
of the Whole.
Mr. CHANDLER. I did not intend to move
in this matter when the recommendation firstcame
from the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the
amount of Treasury notes now in circulation, but
to await the action of the House of Representa-
tives. The effect, however, of his recommenda-
tion has been so disastrous that I deem it my duty
to offer this resolution at this time, and I hope it
will be passed. The effect of his mere recom-
mendation, without any action of Congress on the
subject, has created such a panic and has so con-
vinced the moneyed center of the world that we arc
to be flooded with this paper, that gold has risen
in price from two and three quarters to seven per
cent, premium.
Mr. President, national credit is precisely like
individual credit. It is based first on the ability
to pay, and second upon the high and honorable
principle which would induce the payment of a
liability. When the proposition to issue Treasury
notes was first mad*, it was received with great
apprehension by Congress and by the nation. As
early as March, 1861,1 urged upon the Secretary
of the Treasury the ubsolute necessity of such an
issue, and gave at that time as a reason for it the
vacuum which had been produced in the North-
west by the depreciation of southern stocks. There
was at that time a vacuum, in my estimation, of
about fifty million dollars that must be filled from
some source, and I then urged most strenuously
upon the Secretary of the Treasury the recom-
mendation to Congress of this currency. 1 then
believed that $100,000,000 was requisite, and that
$100,000,000 was enough. I believe so now.
When you issue §100,000,000 of currency, you
must either find a vacuum or you must create one
for it. A hundred millions in addition to the ex-
isting circulation would at any time create great
disturbance in the financial condition of this coun-
try. The vacuum at that time existed in but one
portion of the United States, and that the North-
west. The East was full. Still I believed that a
vacuum could be created for the other $50,000,000,
and that §100,000,000 could be used with advant-
age to the Treasury and to the nation. The work-
ing of the bill allowing an issue of §150,000,000
must have proved highly satisfactory not only, to
the Secretary of the Treasury but to the nation at
large. The suspension of specie payments did not
materially affect the value of coin, and, even in ad-
dition to the suspension, the derangement caused
by furnishing $150,000,000 of irredeemable circu-
lation only affected the price of gold to the slight
extent of two and three fourths per cent.
The average bank circulation throughout the
United States is a fraction under thirty days. The
entire bank circulation of the United States does
not average quite thirty days. In the agricultural
districts it averages more; in the large moneyed
centers it averages much less. The Government
of the United States can expect but very little
more circulation for its issues than the banks can.
Thus it will be seen that if the circulation of the
$150,000,000 averages thirty days, that amount
will perform the work of $1,800,000,000 per an-
num, and no one pretends that we shall require
one third of that amount.
If 1 were to touch the already authorized issue
of demand Treasury notes, 1 should reduce it from
$150,000,000 to $100,000,000, because I believe
$100,000,000 would perform all that is requisite for
it to perform; but having authorized $150,000,000,
1 am not disposed to interfere with it. But, sir, the
momentyou authorize the issue of $300,000,000, to
be used to be sure at the discretion of the Secre-
tary, the fear that it may be thrust upon the banks
and bankers of the land, creates at once a panic,
it creates a surplus of circulation, it creates a fear,
a dread, a distrust; and your notes will depreciate.
I care not whether you call it notes depreciating
or coin appreciating; the moment you authorize
the issue of $300,000,000 your coin will rise to ten
on twelve percent., or your notes will fall to ninety
or eighty-five. The result will be that the Govern-
ment will be paying just so much more for every
article it purchases than it would if you kept your
circulating notes at or about the value of coin.
Again, sir, the momentyou reduce the value of
these notes, even to the point at which they now
stand, even to seven per cent, discount, you diive
out of circulation the coin of the countiy. The
temptation is too strong to be resisted, to use
something else besides coin for change and for
small circulation. But, sir, at two or three per
cent., the price at which it stood before, it does
not thus affect the circulation; it is a small matter,
and change continues in circulation. Arc we to
be reduced to a shinplaster circulation, as is the
case to-day all through the South ? That will be
the result if you force upon the country an amount
of circulating notes beyond its requirements.
My proposition in this joint resolution is that
the amount of legal Lender Treasury notes already
authorized by law shall never be increased; and it
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to iseue
§100,000,000 of Treasury ten days' certificates,
bearing five per cent, interest, in addition to the
$50,000,000 already authorized by law. The
chairman of the Committee on Finance will re-
member that when he first proposed to issue
$50,000,000 of these demand certificates, I moved,
as an amendment, that it be made $100,000,000,
and told him and the Senate that I believed that
the Treasury required $100,000,000, instead of
$50,000,000. The Secretary and the chairman of
the Committee on Finance thought otherwise. I
hold in my hand a table showing the working of
the first $50,000,000. The week ending Febru-
ary 11, 1862, the whole receipts into the Treas-
ury, from these five per cent, certificates, were
$934,630; the following week there was received
$1,359,760. You see that they increased gradu-
ally. The thing was not at first understood, and
I desire to show the Senate, and particularly the
chairman of the Committee on Finance, the work-
ing of this great savingsinstitution which we have
established as a Government institution. I there-
fore go a little more into detail than is perhaps
interesting, but 1 deem it necessary.
For the week ending March 4, there were re-
ceived $5,018,455; and in the next week the first
draft was made upon this fund. The following
week there was deposited $4,527,693, and at that
time there had been received in all $10^775,618,
and the whole amount withdrawn up to that date
was $593,200—only five per cent. Understand,
this was from February 11 to March 11. That
was the working of one month. The receipts had
been $10,775,000 in round numbers, and the whole
amount of draft from that but $593,000. The
following week there was) received on deposit
$2,706,386, making the amount in all received
$15,303,312, and the draft for that week was
$665,965. I give the balances simply. The fol-
lowing week there was received $552,675 and the
amount of drafts was $65,550, making the whole
amount $18,009,698. The following week theie
was received $914,488, and the amount of draft
was$167,797;the wholeamount$l8,562,373. The
following week the receipts were $2,371,105; the
drafts $622,300; the whole amount, §19,476,862.
The following week the whole amount had risen
to $21,847,967. The receipts for that week were
$7,266,130 and the drafts $206,905. The follow-
ing week there was a still larger sum received;
$9,164,055. The whole amount then on deposit
was $29,114,097. The whole amount of draft that
week was $487,700. The following week the
whole amount on deposit had risen to $38,278,152.
The receipts were $7,544,500, and the amount of
draft $192,400. The following week the amount
on deposit was $45,822,652, and the amount of
drafts was only $63,500. Thus you see it was
increasing very rapidly, and rapidly concentrating
the idle capital of the nation into the Treasury of
the United States. On that week the receipts were
so heavy, and the Secretary being authorized to
issue but $50,000,000, he reduced the amount of
interest from five to four per cent.; and from that
time the appreciation of course was not large with
the five per cents. The next week it amounted to
$47,275,122, and the whole amount of draft was
$269,530. After that he paid five per cent, no lon-
ger; he reduced the amount on all deposits there-
after received to four per cent. On the 24th day
of April the first $100 were deposited in the Treas-
ury at four per cent., and up to yesterday, the
17th of June, the whole amount of money received
on deposit by the Secretary of the Treasury at
fourpercent.was$12,042,076. Thewholeamount
on deposit yesterday in the Treasury, at five per
cent., was $44,025,074; thus making the whole
amount now on deposit $56,067,150.
