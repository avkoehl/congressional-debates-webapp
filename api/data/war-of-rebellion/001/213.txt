(Received A. G. O., March 28.)

Colonel L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. A.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that everything is quiet around us, and that we do not see any work being prosecuted except that at the new battery at Fort Jackson. They are practicing this morning with shells from the columbiads at Fort Moultrie and from a mortar battery between Nos. 9 and 10.

I inclose herewith a report of the condition of our fort. It will be seen that a great deal of work has been done since we came in. We are now about finishing the closing of the openings in the gorge-a measure first suggested by Captain Doubleday.

I have not noted the different operations we have been engaged in from time to time, as I did not deem them of sufficient importance to require it.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
