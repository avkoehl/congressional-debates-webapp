of that stream. The remainder of the command might come to Jefferson Barracks and take post on the Carondelet road so as to be free to move in the direction of Kirkwood or the city. Will have a militia regiment from Carondelet to guard the Meramec railroad bridges, and the advanced brigade of your command can then occupy a position in front while you command the road to Kirkwood; but keep your railroad trains ready till we see what the cavalry develops to-morrow, and let the operator stay with the advance brigade at the Meramec bridge.

ROLLA, September 28, 1864-8.50 a. m.

Colonel DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

You should send me at once by extra train ammunition for my two guns. I must get it while the road is open. The train from here will reach Franklin in three hours. If you can make the connection it will be all right. Charge the conductor that he must keep a good lookout at Knob View, for that is the nearest point to Potosi. I have not got enough ammunition at the fort to stand protracted siege.
