CAPTAIN: I have the honor to make the following report of the Fourth Regiment, Pennsylvania Reserve Volunteer Corps, in the actions of Antietam, September 16-17, 1862:

The Fourth Regiment, Pennsylvania Reserve Volunteer Corps, marched from near Keedysville, on the Williamsport road, on the 16th of September, 1862. When near the Williamsport and Sharpsburg turnpike the enemy was discovered to our left. We immediately advanced toward the enemy, marching in column of division, until we arrived at a woods directly in front of the enemy's position, where we were deployed in line under cover of the woods, and where we lay on our arms for the night, throwing out a few men as pickets. Early next morning we were marched in column of division to the front and deployed in front of the enemy. We were then marched by the left flank under a very destructive fire from the enemy, when the regiment gave way, but it soon rallied and advanced to the front, maintaining its ground. Shortly after the enemy gave way. Being relieved by Sumner's corps, fell to the rear, where the regiment was again formed ready for action, but was not called upon. A list of the killed, wounded, and missing has been furnished.+

On Sunday, 14th instant, my regiment was ordered by you to take a position on the north side of a hill, a spur of the South Mountain, in the good old State of Maryland, near the Monocacy, and charge the enemy through a corn-field on the northern slope, go to the top of the hill, and hold it, and be sure to kill some of the rebels. In the march my regiment was the fourth in the brigade. I followed the skirmishers of the
