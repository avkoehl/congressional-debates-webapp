You will organize the mounted men of your command into a battalion and the dismounted men into another battalion. This organization is merely temporary. You will inform the brigadier-general commanding at what time you will probably reach West Point. The ordnance officer of your brigade has drawn some guns and accouterments for your command which will be sent up on the train to-day. I send you seventy pay-rolls. You will have them filled out, and the funds will soon be in hand to pay the troops.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. GOODMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CHALMERS' DIVISION OF CAVALRY,Macon, Miss., April 24, 1865.

Colonel J. C. DENIS,

Commanding Brigade Mississippi Reserves, Scooba, Miss.:

COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you move with your brigade by the most practicable route to West Point, where you will go into camp. You will probably find the road by Starkville the best, but you will use your discretion in the selection of that to be traveled. You will notify the brigadier-general commanding of the time you leave Scooba, when you will probably be at Starkville, if you move on that road, and when you will arrive at West Point. Division headquarters will be at this place for a few days and will then be removed to West Point.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. GOODMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Organize the dismounted men of your command into a company and send them to this place to report to the commandant of the post for duty.
HEADQUARTERS ROSS' CAVALRY BRIGADE,Canton, Miss., April 24, 1865.

Captain PERCY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAPTAIN: Your communication containig instructions in regard to funds and property captured from the streamer Union has been received and I have the honor to report that I will have the funds turned over to my quartermaster and also as much of the property as can be found and collected. Lieutenant West is now collecting the funds, which I believe is still in the hands of the men, but the goods and chattels have been disposed of by sale, divided out and appropriated by themselves, and it will be difficult to get at the captured articles. A portion of the funds has already been used by the men in buying horses to mount themselves, but they will also be held with the remainder of the money.

Very respectfully,

DUD. W. JONES,

Colonel, Commanding Ross' Brigade.
