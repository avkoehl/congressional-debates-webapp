Messrs. JOHN SLIDELL, JAMES M. MASON, GEORGE EUSTIS and J. E. MACFARLAND.

GENTLEMEN: Your letter dated the 9th instant was handed to me yesterday. I shall transmit it agreebly to your request to the honorable Secretary of the Navy with my report of the transaction to which it refers.

In reply to your wish to have any inaccuracies it may contain pointed out I deem it my duty to say that the facts differ materially in respect to the time and circumstances.

First, the facts in my possession are derived from the log book (the official record of the ship); and second, from the reports in writing of all the officers who visited the Trent, all which will form a part of my report.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES WILKES,

Captain, Commanding San Jacinto.

She has on board Messrs Slidell, Mason, Eustis and Macfarland, all of whom she took out of the English steamer Trent on the 8th instant. The moment she gets through with taking on board 100 tons of coal she will start for New York.
