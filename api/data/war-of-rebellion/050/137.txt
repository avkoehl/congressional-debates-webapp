HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND, September 19, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The enemy, re-enforced by Joe Johnson, and Longstreet Virginia, doubtless intended us all the mischief in their power. It is of the utmost importance that you close down this way to cover our left flank. Your cavalry ought to be in the vicinity of Tyner's now. We have not the force to cover our flank against forces [Forrest] now. He could cross the river above us before we could discover it, having to mass the three brigades to cover the gaps and Will's Valley, on our right and rear, and are massed in Chattanooga Valley, from 15 to 20 miles south of Chattanooga. The enemy's main force at La Fayette, and thence toward Dalton and Ringgold. We may want all the help we can get promptly.

Very respectfully, you obedient servant,
