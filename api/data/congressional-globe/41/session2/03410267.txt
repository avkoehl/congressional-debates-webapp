APPENDIX B.
Extracts from testimony taken by Committee of Ways
and Means, Boston, October 25,1869.
Testimony of E. B. Bigelow.
By Mr. Maynakd:
Question. How long have you been engaged in the
business of manufacturing ?
Answer. In various forms since 1837.
Question. Since that time how have the profits
upon capital engaged in manufacturing compared
with those on capital engaged in commerce?
Answer. I cannot make the comparison, not hav-
ing been engaged in commerce myself. I may say,
however, that the profits on manufactures have not
exceeded the legal rate of interest. You may go
back thirty or forty years, and take the whole period,
I presume the profit will not exceed that rate of
interest.
Testimony of Enoch R. Mudge.
I would indorse most emphatically the statement
of Mr. Bigelow that the profits derived from manu-
facturing have not exceededthe legal rate of interest
so far as my experience has gone, and it runs back to
1846 in manufacturing, and in business to 1832.
By Mr. Hooper:
Question. Then you would say that where manu-
facturing has been eavriod on without capital—that
is, upon borrowed money—therehas been no profit?
Answer. I should say so decidedly. I should say
that has been almost Ihe invariable result. Almost
the only manufacturing establishmentsthataro able
to live at all are those which have a large capital
over and above the amount invested in machinery.
Testimony of Amot A. Lawrence.
A good many years ago I made up a table up to
that time of the fosses of the Lowell factories and of
several other corporations well known here. I went
to then* treasurers and took the dividends back
fifteen or twenty years, and the result showed a very
low rate of interest as profits; and these, bear in
mind, were not unsuccessful concerns, but were
among the most succcssful. The rate was not very
much more than 6 per eenr., certainly not more than
7? percent., and if 1 had included the establishments
which had been destroyed and lost, the rate would
have been less than 6 per cent.
Mr. Mudge: There has been a very great misap-
prehension in this respect, arising fiom the fact that
many of the largo concerns which commenced oper-
ations without an adeauate cash capital to operate
them failed in business, and tfcese properties have
been purchased at a very great sacrifice. This has
in some instances enabled the parties to make largo
gains upon their actual investments. I recollect
that the sto^k of an establishment, which 1 repre-
sent os agent, which cost #1,000 par, was sold as low
as $140. This was the Chicopee establishment, and
one of the oldest in the State. The Washington
mills were bought for $500,000, although they origin-
ally cost over $2,000,000.
Mr. IIoopkr inquired how foreign manufacturers
particularlv engaged in manufacturing cotton were
now doing?
Mr. Lawrence: I should say they are in very bad
condition. They have always had their "ups and
downs," as we have, but now there docs not seem to
be any prospect of their corning up, as in former
years. Some of them are now coming here as active
manufacturers, and if this state of things continues
they will, many of them, come to this country and
bring their machinery with them.
