Public Lands—Mr. Hnrrison.
Ho. of Reps.
would probably decide the fate of tho bill, he must
ask the House to indulge him in making a brief
explanation of its piovisions, and the peculiar
claim to relief the individuals had for whose ben-
efit it was intended. He was never disposed to
waste the time of the House, especially when so
little remained in which to transact the great
amount of important public business, and would
promise not to consume as mucli in stating the
menta of the bill, as the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr Lincoln] had in the technical ob-
jection he had made to its consideration at this
time.
After the treaty with the Creek Indiana, these
•settlers- had temoved into the territory acauired,
«and made valuable improvements on fertile land
Indeed, he had been informed that they are much
the most valuable improvements in the country
At the passage of the preemption law in 1834,
they were completely embraced within its provis-
ions; and, at the time of the first land sale in the
Oeek country, (in January, 1834,) they were
«dually settled on their improvements At that
time, tfie chiefs' and orphans' reserves, authoi-
ized by the Creek tieaty to be selected, had been
already located by Colonel Bright, the agent up
pointed for that purpose, but upon unnnpioved
though fertile land. After this, and while these
settlers were peaceably residing on then own im-
provements, not even subject to be divested by
these contingent locations, (for they had been se-
lected by the agent,) that agent was prevailed
Upon to remove the locations he had at fust made
for the chiefs and oiphans,and placo them on the
valuable improvements of these settleis, only ren-
deied more valuable than the lands before located
on by the labor and expenso of these industrious
and enterprising citizens. Mr C. said it was not
certain but that these injured settlers might have
successfully resisted the authority and binding
effect of the change of locations, but ihoy were
too poortoundertakoaeontiovcrsy so expensive,
-arid were forced togivouptheu homt s,and, with
their families, seek shelter elsowherp, relying on
ibejustiae of this Government to make them com
pensation for their losses.
Mr. C said, that veiy soon after he had the
honor of holding a seat on this floor, he had
brought this subject before Congress, and made
a repoit, accompanied by a bill (01 the lehtf of
these settlers That bill bad been again and ngam
reported by him to this House, but, like many
other important measures that propose to relieve
only one class of citizens, he had found it impoi
sible to get it duectly considered. The bill In
had repoited proposed nothing moie than lhn<n
individuals were justly entitltd to But still it
proposed much more than this That bill pio
posed an absolute fpant to those settlers of one
quarter section df land, subject to private entry,
by paying the fees of office only, 01 a quui ti i si c-
tion of othei ¡and not settled upon, at Govt m-
ment puce Tlus bill proposes no giant, but only
authorizes such settlers who establish the facts I
have stated as thegiound of their clum by pioof,
to enter arty land at Government price not settled
opon.
The advantage this bill proposes is inconsider-
able indeed, for m the country to which they uro
confined, I assure the House, but little landwoith
More than Government price can be found, if
any, not now settled upon But still they propose
to take this bill, rather than submit to fui ther de
lay, or get nothing.
Mr. C. sa«l he could show precedents for a
grant, without price, of three hundied and twenty
«eres to each settler in Arkansas, under sirmlai
ciroumataneBs, but for these citizens no such ben-
efit m asked, nor, indeed,-anything that can pos-
«íbly prejudice the Government, for no land sells
for more than a fr-action over the mimmumpnce,
and they are required to pay that much.
Mr C.saaid that on several occasions this bill
has passed the Setiate, and has been lost in this
House, either for want of time, or for some ob-
jection made to it here One objection has been
heretofore that, under its provisions, a great
many might claim who are not entitled This
bill guards against any such frauds; however,
since the last session, proof has been made of all
«who are entitled, which is now on your table,
«nid the whole number does not exceed -sixty or
sixty-five. He knew most of them personally,
and moie honest, mdustiious, respectable citizens
cannot be found in any country, nor none more
meiitonous. He was conscious of having most
earnestly piessed the claims of these citizens,
since he had been a member of this body No
oppoitunity had been suffered to pass unim-
proved, to obtain for them that justice he had
been satisfied they were entitled to, before he had
a seat hcie He had been less fortunate in this
House than the able and efficient Senntois from
his State, in the other, had been in their efforts,
and consequently some had insinuated a want of
zeal on his part, in pressing this measuie, but he
would not regard such insinuations, and should,
in despite of them, contmue to urge then claims
Pending the motion of Mr Lincoln to com-
mit, Mr WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, moved
to lay the bill on the table; which motion pie-
vailed.

Mr HARRISON said
Mr Speaker In the invest'gation which I
propose to make of the doctrines and pnneiples
set forth in the resolutions which I submitted to
the select committee to whom the subject of the
public lands was refeired, I deem it proper to
state, at the thieshold, that no extraneous influ-
ence whatever induced me to introduce these les-
oluttons, which have been so unceiemontously
denounced as " startling, monstrous,and extiaoi-
dinary " I consulted no human being on the
subject. 1 had no secret or disguised object m
view, either personal or political It was not my
wish or intention that the resolutions should be
connected with any party, or any máuence that
was now agitating the country, noi did I look
forward to an v feeling of popular favor that might
be attained by their introduction, since it is my
unalterable determination not to apply again for
a seat upon this floor upon the expiration of th,e
UWM I have yet to=*erve.   I have btep actuated
by higher motives, and influenced by considera.-
tions of a more comprehensive and patriotic chai -
acter. It is my sober and dehbtiate conviction
that these resolutions contain a true exposition
of the relative powers and lights of the new
States, and advmce no (lóenme that is not sus
tamed by the   Constitution, by the eaiiy docu-
I mentary lustoiy of the countiv , and by all the
fundamental punciples and analogies of the Go\-
e. nment
Tne gentleman from Vngmid [Mi Robert-
son] and myself differ widely on the questions
involved in this subject Were I to admit Ins
premises, I should be foiced to adopt his conc'u
sions But I go behind all the positions lie has
taken, and contend, and shall endeavor to show,
that the compacts made between the General
Government and the several States that made
the cessions, upon which he seems to rely with
so much confidence, do not give the power to
bind and restuct us, as has been oxctcised to-
wards us, that they cottM not give the powers
claimed, because, having been made during the
existence of the Ameles of Confedeiation, that
liistuimcnt positively prohibited, and the Con-
stitution ot the United ¡Mates, coining into exist-
ent p upon the dissolution of the Ameles of Con-
federation, nowlieie authoiizetl, ihe exeicisc or"
such povveis I go fuither I not only main-
tain the doetune that these compacts do not
give the poweis which are claimed, and if they
did, ill it thpy are void, because against the ex-
piess It tter of the Aiticles of Confedeiation,
which were the paramount law of the land at the
time these compacts weie made, but also, that it
nevei was the intention of those who fiamed
those anieles that the rediralGovernmentshould
1 have the power of owuu g the lands lying within
j   the limits of a State   m fact, sir, so fat iiom en
tcttaimn^ any such idea, that they did, in the
I  most positivt and unequivocal manner, expiess
' a contuny intention And this I will piove ftoro
facts that of cm led at that penod, constituting a
poitiou of tht  history of that day, winch cannot
I   be met, coi ti ulicted, oi denied
In the examination ol these lesolutions we
must look clost ly nt the natuie and chat ictei of
oui Govi linnent, its Constitution, the object and
t \tent t f the powers granted, and oí   the lights
| and poweis oí the sevei il Stites anteiioi and
subsequent to the formation of the Confetleiaey
I It is in this way th if 1 mi an to examine the sub-
ject, and ende n oi  to establish all the punciples
|  which I have advanct d
The Fulcial Government is the creature of the
States, made by them for their common benefit,
and the Consti ution of the United States the great
chaitci of Pideial powei The beauty oí the
system is, that the Federal Government, having
been eieated ioi cei tain great nation il pui poses,
which could not have been attained so well with-
out a common Union, denvmgall ltspowns from
the Slates that formed it, can exercise none but
such as aie specifically gianted and enumerated
in the instrument that contains these powers
And if we desno to know whether the Geneial
Government can exercise a particular powei,the
only guide that we have in making such inquiry
is the Constitution The poweis, therefoie, of
the General Government are binding, so far as
they aie given, and all laws, compacts, treaties,
and ordinances, made without authonty from the
Constitution, aie void
In section thud of article fourth of the Consti-
tution of 'he United States, we find the power
that is given for the admission of new States It
is contained in one short line It says, "new
States may be admitted into the Union " The
language is plain and simple No power is found
connected with the power to admit which authoi
izes the Geneial Gov crnment to impose conditions
and lestnctions upon the new States when ad-
mitted into the Union Now, as the Constitution
is an instrument containing delegated powers only,
authorizing the Federal Government to exercise
such alone as are specifically granted and enu-
merated, I call upon gentlemen opposed to me on
this subject to inform me how, and fiom whence
they "et the power to impose conditions upon the
new States, which weie not and cannot be im-
posed upon the original thirteen. Is not the
-power for the admission of the new States full
