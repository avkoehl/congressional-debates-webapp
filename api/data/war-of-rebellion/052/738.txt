Brigadier-General GRIERSON:

A citizen, K. M. Harden, who lives 6 miles east of Purdy, reports this afternoon that Colonel Wilson, rebel, crossed the Tennessee River at Saltillo on Tuesday, the 15th instant, with about 500 men; swam their horses. On Wednesday Colonel Wilson passed near Purdy, going toward Jackson. His avowed purpose is to conscript.

They shot the father of one of the officers of the Sixth Tennessee Cavalry. That regiment asks permission to go after Wilson.

Your obedient servant,

L. F. McCRILLIS,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Brigade.

COLLIERVILLE, September 19, 1863.

Brigadier-General GRIERSON:

We were delayed at Corinth on account of horse equipments;

nearly all of ours were condemned. We cannot move from Memphis without them. At least 250 saddles are needed; those in use are ruining the horses; we have 200 dismounted men. A complete set of harness for forge; good horses for same. Many complaints to make, but will be in Memphis by daylight, God willing.

F. W. BENTEEN,

Major Tenth Missouri Cavalry.
