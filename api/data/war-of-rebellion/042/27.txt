OBSTRUCTIONS INSIDE OF DOG RIVER BAR.

These are completed, excepting the rafts for closing channel openings left in the lines of obstruction. The two rafts are now being built.

BATTERIES AT CHOCTAW POINT, PINTO'S ISLAND SPIT, AND SPANISH RIVER.

These batteries are complete.

APPALACHEE BATTERY, AND BATTERY AT HEAD OF BLAKELY ISLAND.

The first named has been finished for some months, and the guns of both are mounted. It is hoped that the last-named work will be wholly completed in the current month.

OBSTRUCTIONS AT APPALACHEE AND BAKELY ISLANDS.

Operations on these were resumed about the middle of the month, and will be prosecuted through the month of June.

BATTERY AT CHACTAW SPIT.

Being deficient in transportation for carrying on this and the Blakely Island Battery at the same time, operations on that at Choctaw Spit were suspended. It is proposed to resume the work as soon as practicable.

TORPEDOES.

By order of the commanding general, 150 torpedoes have been procured. A few have been placed at Grant's Pass and in the narrow channel east of Spanish River Battery. The remainder will be held in readiness to be placed when necessary.

CITY INTRENCHMENTS.

Fourteen redoubts have been built around the city, a few of them not yet wholly finished, but defensible. Two more remain to be built, and also two or three small intermediate flanking works.

The Governor of the want of labor for agricultural purposes, the force employed here during the months has been very small; sometimes it has been reduced to 150 hands at the city intrenchments, and at other points in proportion. The total number procurable, and now employed in this department, does not exceed 700, of which 450 are engaged on the city intrenchments. Guns have been mounted on nearly all the redoubts around the city.

BATTERY AT OVEN BLUFF, TOMBIGBEE RIVER.

This battery is in good condition, with the exception of some repairs required for magazines.

A small force of carpenters has been engaged in framing the river obstructions at this place. Half of the stones required for anchors have been quarried, and the work will be prosecuted during the current month.
