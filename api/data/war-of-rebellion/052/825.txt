CRUFT'S HEADQUARTERS, Pan-Coupe, September 24, 1863-11 p.m.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

SIR: Since 10 p.m. the pickets in front of Wood and Palmer have been firing, and a report has come in that our pickets were driven to the railroad. I have seen the fire from that line. No pickets have come in, and at this moment all firing has ceased in my front, with the exception of an occasional shot from Grose's cannon. The firing has just opened on my right, but it is not heavy, principally from our cannon. As I approached the front I noticed a white rocket followed by a red one.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 24-11.30 p.m.

Major General T. L. CRITTENDEN:

The general commanding directs that you immediately forward a report of the reconnaissance made by your command this afternoon, which has not yet been received. He also directs me to inform you that it has been reported to him that several shots fired from the lunette occupied by Colonel Grose's brigade fell in the rear of our own men. This should be corrected.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,WM. L. PORTER,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
