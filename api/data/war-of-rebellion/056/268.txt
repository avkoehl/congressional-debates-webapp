HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, November 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Buckland's battery will be sent you by morning train. If you move forward take everything that can fight and push these marauders hard. I hardly think yet that they will come, but they may, for Lee is bold.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, November 28, 1863. (Received 29th.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

I have no troops west of here but Buckland's brigade. I have just ordered him to be ready. If that is wrong, please send him word immediately.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

It was an error; should be east. Buckland will remain where he is.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, Tennessee, November 28, 1863.

Brig. General A. J. SMITH,

Columbus:

The enemy under Stephen D. Lee are demonstrating in such force on Corinth that I find it necessary to recall Hatch and his cavalry from north of the railroad.

I still think they mean to get into West Tennessee, but they will be followed closely.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, November 28, 1863. (Received 10 p.m.)

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Nothing more from Mizner. General Tuttle telegraphs his scouts report enemy moving from Jackson, Tennessee, east. I think there is but little doubt there is to be a combined attack on this post. If possible, I should be strengthened. I am desperately weak. The Engineer battalion are the only really reliable soldiers here, in my opinion. They number but about 400. I have countermanded the order of General Webster for their removal. I shall hold the post to the last extremity if attacked.

JNumbers D. STEVENSON.
