April 22,
142 East Thirtieth street,
â€¢ New York, April 12,1869.
Dear Sir: How far the interest ofayoung man and
a stranger, one totally opposed to your political
tenets, in your recent statesmanlike ana decided
action in the Senate may be acecptable to you I
have no means of judging, but to know tnat your
appeal for the people, and your just rebuke to their
pretended representatives meet with responsive ap-
preciation from those who have studied earnestly
tho problem of successful republicanism, and hoped,
until despair came to watch with them, for some
fearless advocate of right and honesty, must be a
source of high gratification to you as a man, and of
encouragement in the unthankful office of censor to
jour compeers.
A man who would shrink from the course you have
adopted because of the sneers of foes and the faint
praise of friends, would deserve the ignomy which
would be sure to overtake and overwhelm him. ^ A
courageous persistence carrieswithitaweightofsm-
cerity which wins its way in spite of place andpower.
The school of politics in which I was brought up
always left me at liberty to admire the patriotic
course of any man, no matter what his party, arid
taught me to adopt as my own all the good I could
find in whatever creed. What tangible^ result mav
be obtained by a steady adherence to principle? and
a continued exposition of the mal-administratmn
of affairs at Washington and elsewhere, it would be
too soon now to inquire, but I might build a well-
grounded hope that the veto power of justice would
not be entirely suspended if the integrity and fear-
lessness of purpose in the future of Senator Sprague
were a sure sequel of his past course. In conclusion,
I would ask for a copy of your speech.
Very respectfully, LEWIS SANDERS.
Senator Sprague.
Chelsea, Massachusetts, April 13,1869.
Dear Sir: I have tried to find yourreceot speeches

Dear Sir: Will you be good enough to send me your
recent speeches in the United States Senate on the
subject of loaning the public money ? I should like
to understand fully your ideas on that subject, which
I cannot very well do from the reports sent to the
Associated Press. ,

lic documents besides your speeches that are of great
or general interest.

of you the favor to send me your speeches, which

Hon. Senator Sprague.
Lowell, Massachusetts, April 14,1869.
Dear Sir: I take the liberty of asking you to send
me a few copies of your speeches recently made, and
I do so the more readily from the fact that Cranston
was my birth place, and I am anxious to see what it
is that has been said by one to the "manner born"
which causes the "galled jade to wince."
Very respectfully, GEORGE HOBSON.
Boston, April 1G, 1869,
My Dear Sir: 1 am daily asked by Boston mer-
chants for copies of your recent speeches in the Sen-
ate, and I trust that you will send some at your
earliest convenience.
The men of common sense in tbis section of the
country indorse what you have said.
Truly and respectfully, vours,

New York, April 16, 1869.
Senator: Will you excuse a stranger for this intru-
sion on your official time? lamwellawarethatyour
time and attention are engrossed in your duties and
official labors; still I can hardly suppress the utter-
ance of my sincere and heartfelt commendation of
the noble, dignified, intelligent, and patriotic stand
you have recently taken in your place in the United
States Senate. 1 congratulate you, sir, and the coun-
try that we have one man in the Senate, though from
"little Rhody," who dares behonest, intelligent, and
patriotic. It is mortifying to us New Yoikers that
we have no one inthe Senatewhohastheabilityand
independence to throw himself into the breach be-
tween the country and the party and yield his devo-
tion to tho former rather, if needs be, than the latter.
Rhode Island, through one, at least, of her repre-
sentatives, deserves well of the Republic, and I doubt
not, will sooner or later receive her reward.
I have been doubting for some years whether or
not ail of our great and patriotic men had not left the
councils of the country, but thank Heaven there is
hope yet for our beloved country anditsinstitutions.
Allow ine again to thank you for your able and
judicious and independent speeches lately delivered
in the Senate. I have read them as they have synop-
tically been presented through the journals.
If it is not taxing you too much, would you do me
the favor to send me a few copies if they are to bo
issued in pamphlet form ? JL would like to distribute
them among my friends. In the course you have
taken you will have, I doubt not, the support and
concurrence of your honored father-in-law, our
worthy "Chief Justice." God bless him, he ought to
have been now President.
Pardon the liberty I take, and allow me to sub-
scribe myself, your obedient servant,
,, CHARLES S. GOODRICH,
Late UnitedSfate& Consul, France.

Dear Sir: The writer wishes to congratulate you
on the truth of your remarks in the United States
Senate of late in regard to the corruption of public
men. It is the same in private life, in a business
way. The writer has had a long experience in this
city, and am sorry to say that it seems to grow worse
and worse. It is time for some one to speak out, and
I I am glad to see you are not afraid to do it.
I I have never had the pleasure of seeing you, but
' if vou should ever happen to think of it when home
i ask my old friend Whipple, the hatter, in your city.

Dear Sir: Will you permit me to add ray mite of
praise in behalf of the good work that you have
undertaken? I know but of two epochs m history m
which public men were as corrupt as theyaie now.
The first immediately after the proscription of Svlia ;
the second under the French Directory. You have
put your hand to the plow; see that you drive the
share deep down until you shall weed out all the
corruption in Oongress. Will yon be kind enongh
to send me a cony of your speeches when you have
them ready? I know several gentlemen who will be
glad to get them. The corruptionists hatoyou. You
must expect to be abused, villified. and misrepre-
sented. Do not flag; you will have God, the people,
and a good cause to sustain you. _
