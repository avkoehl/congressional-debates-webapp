H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., [February] 5-7 p.m.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL, Louisville, Ky.:

Halleck telegraphs that report says 10,000 men left Bowling Green by railroad to re-enforce Fort Henry, and asks for regiments from Ohio. If report true, can you not assist by a demonstration in direction of Bowling Green? Communicate with Halleck and assist him if possible. Please reply.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 5, 1862-7 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Have telegraphed Buell to communicate with you, and suggested demonstration on Bowling Green. Have just moved eight regiments from Ohio into Western Virginia. Cannot well spare more thence from Buell unless absolutely necessary. Please communicate fully with Buell and with me.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, February 5, 1862-12 p.m.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

I am communicating with him [Halleck]. Bowling Green is secure from any immediate apprehension of attack by being strongly fortified behind a river, by obstructions on the roads for nearly the whole distance between us (40 miles), and by the condition of the roads themselves; can only be threatened with heavy artillery. No demonstration, therefore, is practicable. I will send him a brigade.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, February 5, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

I will re-enforce your column by a brigade from Green River if you find that you absolutely require it; otherwise I have use for it. Do I understand you are moving up the Tennessee River only? You must not fail.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, February 5, 1862.
