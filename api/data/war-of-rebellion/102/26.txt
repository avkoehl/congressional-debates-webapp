C. S. CHARLOT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST, Keokuk, April 3, 1865.

Brigadier General H. H. SIBLEY,Saint Paul, Minn.:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your favor of the 26th ultimo* containing a letter from Captain Howe, commanding at Fort Ripley, expressing apprehensions of hostilities on the part of the Chippewa Indians as soon as spring fairly opens. The cause of hostilities represented by Captain Howe is not, as your letter implies, attributable to rebels, but "dealers in substitutes; " and your immediate exertions must be manifested not only to prevent outrages such as the captain names, of running off "their young men in considerable numbers and much against their will," but also to show these Indians our resentment of such conduct. If possible, you will also ascertain where such young men may have been sent and the circumstances, so that they may be released if, as stated, they have been abducted and improperly made to endure our service. In the meantime it is proper to prepare for the threatened resentment, whatever may be the cause, and I have forwarded your communication to division headquarters, calling attention to the necessity of retaining or substituting the troops proposed to be withdrawn. I must also express my hope that State authorities will see to the organization and arming of the frontier militia, so as to secure convenient co-operation from that great national reserve if occasion seems to require assistance.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
