Your telegram just received and all is quiet. I do not believe the enemy is in any force in this vicinity. My command is well in hand.

BUDD'S FERRY, March 28, 1862.

General WILLIAMS:

I am informed by contrabands just in from the Rappahannock that several regiments have left their camps about Fredericksburg for the South. It is stated that they left for North Carolina. Almost all the rails have been removed from the road between Aquia and Fredericksburg. The common talk is that the rebels intend to burn the bridges at Fredericksburg on our advance.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS OF THE ARMY,Warrenton Junction, March 28, 1862.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I received during the night and this morning your telegrams of March 27 and March 28-12.30 a. m. I took possession of this junction yesterday afternoon, and immediately sent you the following dispatch by telegraph:
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,Warrenton Junction, March 27, 1862.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I hold Warrenton Junction. The enemy abandoned the position on my approach. His force I have not ascertained. A reconnaissance in force will march to-morrow morning toward the Rappahannock Bridge. The reconnaissance will be commanded by Brigadier-General Howard, and will consist of two regiments of cavalry, one battery, and three regiments of infantry. There has been some slight skirmishing, but we have suffered no loss. If I am to remain here for any length of time I would be glad if my other division could be sent to join me.

E. V. SUMNER,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding Second Corps.

General Howard will move immediately to make the reconnaissance toward the Rappahannock bridge. I should have much preferred to advance with my whole command toward that point, but as your order of March 24 expressly directs me not to proceed beyond this place with the mass of my command I shall await here you further orders. I can take Warrenton without difficulty. Shall I do so?

E. V. SUMNER,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding Second Corps.
