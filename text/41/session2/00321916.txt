THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 12,
This estimate of population is very low,
Washington and Wyoming Territories being
omitted. Eight millions would be nearer the
truth, It was made for 1868.
This table shows the estimated population of
each State. It shows the estimated amountof
circulation given to each one of these States.
But, sir, when the law was first, passed author-
izing the establishment of the associations to
furnish tbis national currency it was provided
that half ofthe circulation, $150,000,000, should
be distributed according to wealth, and one half,
$150,000,000, should be distributed according
to population. And here, sir, I have a table
showing the amount which should be appor-
tioned, under that law, to the sev.eral States
and Territories. In this table it is shown that
while Connecticut is entitled to $7,720,300, she
received $18,225,115, this being an excess of
apportionment to her of over ten million dol-
lars. Massachusetts would be entitled to
$21,795,000, and she received $65,404,170,
being an excess of $43,609,370. New Hamp-
shire has an excess of over seven million dol-
lars. New Jersey has an excess of over three
million dollars. New York has an excess of
overtwenty-two million dollars. Pennsylvania
has an excess of over fourteen million dollars.
Rhode Island has an excess of $8,747,850;
and others of the States have an excess.
Mr. Speaker, this table shows the apportion-
ment according to the estimate of population and
wealth, the excess and the deficiency, to the
several States and Territories. It is as follows :
The following table exhibits the apportionment of currency according to the foregoing estimate,
and the apportionment as it actually exists, as shown by the table on page 23 of the appendix

1 have thus shown some of the evils which
have arisen in the adjustment of this currency.
But we are told that you have here $400,000,000
of Treasury notes, that you have ยง400,000,000
outside of this circulation, and with that it
would seem that you ought to have a fairer
distribution. Well, sir, how is that distributed ?
A portion of the Treasury notes, you are aware,
is locked up in the vaults of the banks. Another
portion of these notes is locked up in the vaults
of the New York city banks to furnish a re-
demption fund there for the country banks ;
and the balance of those notes for the most
part is under the control and within the grasp
of the money operators there. But little of it
circulates at the extremities; but little of it
goes beyond the immediate vaults of the banks
where it is locked up.
In my portion of the country there is none,
or scarcely any, of the Treasury notes in cir-
culation, and the money that is used for the
transaction of business, for the moving of pro-
duce, for all that enters into the transactions
of the business community of the West, is
mainly made up of the national bank currency.
How 'is that currency furnished there? We
have got, as you see, but a very small amount
of banking facilities. It is furnished by pri-
vate bankers, who go to the city, and there
borrow the money upon call, bring it home to
the community in which they reside, and there
lend it to business men; and all who are en-
gaged in business, or who need banking accom-
modations, borrow in that way the money upon
which their business is transacted.
They are required not only to pay a rate of
interest which is sufficient to pay to the New
York bankers the amountof interest paid there,
but they are required to pay also a sufficient
amount of interest to make it profitable to the
men who invest their money in the business
of private banking. That is the way that busi-
ness is transacted there. We pay from twelve
to twenty-four per cent, all over that country
for the necessary money to transact our busi-
ness ; so that we are paying a tax to the East,
we are constantly paying a bonus to the East,
and it is a grievous burden upon the business
interests of the West. I do not wish to be
understood as saying that all private bankers
get money in New York on which to do busi-
ness. They of course have money of their own,
besides using a large line of deposits as else-
where ; but enough money is thus obtained to
regulate the rate of interest to the customers of
those dealing with the country bankers.
According to the report of the Comptrol-
ler of the Currency, the loans of the banks of
the city of New York amount to $160,000,000.
Seventy million dollars of that amount are for
call loans, and about eighty million dollars only
are for legitimate commercial transactions. An
additional amount of inflation is given to the
currency of the city by what are called certified
checks. According to this report $112,000,000
was the amount of certified checks which, in
1868, entered into the business of the city of
New York. That shows us the evil. That
shows us the cause of the burdens under which
we labor in the West.
Now, what is the remedy ? How are we to get
out of t-his difficulty ? That is the question
that addresses itself to us as legislators. That
is the question that at this time interests the
people of this country more than any other.
How are we to get out of the difficulty? Can
we do it by standing still? Can we do it by
permitting an irredeemable currency to float
over this country, say to the amount of
$400,000,000 ? It seems to me that the only
road out of this difficulty is to take such meas-
ures as will secure the refunding or payment
of the greenback circulation in Treasury notes
of the country. We must take the necessary
steps here. The Secretary of the Treasury
needs authority to go forward to redeem this
currency, and it must be redeemed. Well, how
are we going to do it? I know that almost
every member upon this floor has his own plan.
I know that the Senate has to-day sent us a bill
which has been perfected in that body after
long and elaborate and searching discussion.
The plan which the Senate has matured look-
ingin this direction proposes tofundthenational
debt and extend the national currency.
Now, it seems to me that we can get out of
this difficulty without a contraction of the cur-
rency on the one hand or an inflation on the
other. We have in this country, I believe,
a sufficient circulating medium. It is large
enough in volume ; it will transact the busi-
ness of the country. What we want is not so
much money as banking facilities distributed
throughout the country, in the West and in the
South, in Missouri and in Illinois, and in all
the other States where they are deficient, where
they have not got, the necessary circulation, or
the money with which to transact the business
pertaining to those sections of the country.
Now, it may be done in various ways. It is
said that if we should authorize the Secretary
of the Treasury to redeem the greenbacks in
gold it would retire, so far as lie had the means
in his hands, a portion of this currency; but
there is not gold enough in the Treasury to
take steps for immediate resumption. A par-
tial resumption would be safer. If we should
authorize the collectors of customs at the
different ports where our importations enter
to receive a portion of the duties on imports
in greenbacks or Treasury notes, take them
into the Treasury and cancel them, that would
get out of the way a portion of these Treasury
notes. If we should authorize the Secretary
of the Treasury to fund in whatever bonds wo
deem best at a low rate of interest a portion of
this circulation that would get out of the way
another portion of it.
The national banking system has been so
successful, has furnished a circulating medium
so uniform the country over, that the entire
paper currency should be turned into that
channel. Banking is a business like any other
business, and should be engaged in by the cit-
izens under proper restrictions imposed by law;
and Government ought not engage in it, nor
should it furnish any portion of the circulating
medium drawn from banks. The Treasury
notes were put in circulation by force of ex-
traordinary circumstances, circumstances of
war, and should now be replaced by the usual
circulating medium of the country in time of
peace.
