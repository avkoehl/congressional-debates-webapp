I am apprehensive of a movement from the Kanawha, if the troops now under me move much farther in Tennessee. Please keep me fully advised of General Bragg's movements.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. WESTERN VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE, Zollicoffer, September 26, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS,Richmond:

The indications in front of Jonesborough yesterday were such that I did not think it necessary to withdraw to the line of the Watauga and Holston, being reluctant to yield any more ground. I have tolerably reliable information that the main body of the enemy's force left Cumberland Gap on the 12th. Do not know where they went. There are indications that it is coming by Rogersville toward Blountsville. If so, I must return from Jonesborough. From two to four regiments reported occupying Cumberland Gap. General Corse telegraphed me from Bonsack's this morning that his orders from General Pickett were to go to Wytheville, and if the reports of the enemy's advance were false, to return without further orders to Petersburg. Was that your intention? I had ordered him here. If he can be spared it is important to retain him. I cannot withdraw any more troops from Lewisburg or Princeton without exposing too much of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. I left Jenkins' cavalry brigade on the Staunton and Parkersburg turnpike near Monterey. Can I withdraw it with safety to Staunton?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
