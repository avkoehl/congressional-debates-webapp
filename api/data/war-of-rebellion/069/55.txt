HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 21, 1864-9.30 a. m.

General WARREN:

What road do you intend to withdraw by? The ford over the Ny near the Anderson house is very bad-almost impassable from holes. If you move in that direction you had better keep down until you reach the roads and bridges made by Wright from the Myers house.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.

[Indorsement.]

General HUMPHREYS:

I have made crossing places myself. I expect to keep between the Ny and the Anderson house-out of sight. I shall begin promptly at 10 a. m., if General Russell gets out of my way. I relieved him at once on receipt of your order this morning. No demonstration by the enemy yet.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 21, 1864-9.45 a. m.

General WARREN:

The major-general commanding directs that instead of the route indicated to you, you will proceed to Guiney's Bridge by way of Massaponax Church and Giney's Station, instead of taking the Telegraph road from Massaponax Church. Report your arrival there and what you meet. The bridge is now held by the enemy, supposed to be cavalry.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General.

MAY 21, 1864-10 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

General Russell got his orders one hour and forty minutes ago and yet he has not begun to pass. As his road crosses mine I have to wait for him. I am all ready to move.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 21, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The cavalry assigned to you, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Pope, is at Massaponax Church. If you do not go to that place, you will please send an officer to Colonel Pope with your instructions for the cavalry.
