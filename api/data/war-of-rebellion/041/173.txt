ON THE FIELD,

June 10, 1863.

The mortars of the fleet, the mortars of the land batteries, the Parrott and Whitworth guns, opened on us at dusk yesterday evening, and kept up a furious fire through the night. The practice was good and the scenic effect splendid. At 2 o'clock this morning the 8-inch shell gun joined in, and delivered her raking fire along my entire left. Three men were wounded severely during the night. Lieutenant-Colonel [M. J.] Smith's fire was without effect on these pieces, his range being short and his aim inaccurate. Lieutenant-Colonel Smith's guns can only do good by moving one or more of them out to the line. It is for you to determine whether it is politic and practicable to place in position on the outer line his 8-inch gun and 42-pounder. They might silence the enemy's heavy batteries. They are of no value, except for river defense, where they now are.

During the entire day the enemy have been shelling my lines. The men, I am proud to say, bear it like horses, and I think will make good the defense against any assault.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

In addition to the casualties mentioned in my report of yesterday, I have to add four more who were not reported to me until after my report was sent in. None of the wounds serious, however. Last night, on my extreme right, where Lieutenant-Colonel [Fred. B.] Brand commands, my picket was surprised, Lieutenant [J. A.] Taylor, in command of it, seriously wounded, 9 privates and 2 non-commissioned officers captured.

To-day, Captain R. M. Boone (Boone's battery), while at his post directing his guns, was seriously wounded in the thigh. One other man has been wounded to-day.

The enemy has opened some additional guns on me to-day, placed in a new position between Troth's road and the river. He has kept up a tremendous fire during the day from all his guns and mortars, and the small number of casualties would seem to indicate that a special Providence is protecting us.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Last night the guns and mortars from the fleet, as well as the guns and mortars from the numerous batteries on shore, kept up a brisk fire upon us, resulting in no loss of life, or wound, even. During the day
