APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
4i
30th Cong 2d Sess. Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Senate U Ho. of Reps.
Hasten emigration, it issubmitted, whether it would
not be proper for Congress, in advance of our
general legislation, and at an early period, to dele-
gate authority to the department to appoint a su-
perintendent, with a corps of surveyors, to make
a preliminary reconnoissance of the mineral pre-
cincts, and to survey them off into small tracts, to
suit persons desirous of making mineral explora-
tions; say, in lots of ten acres each, being one-
fourth of the present smallest legal subdivision.
Then to fix a reasonable mimimum, with a right
of preemption to the first occupant or discoverer,
and, after exposure to public sale, under such in-
structions as may be given by the department, to
lay open at private entry at the minimum, such
lots as may not be disposed of at public sale.
A measure like this will create a proper relation
and legal connection between the people and their
Government; will afford an opportunity to individ-
uals to obtain a legal title to the lands; and instead
of the irregularity and confusion likely to arise in
the pursuit of ore, will establish system and order,
and insure to every one whatever he may honestly
obtain by his labor, within the limits of his own
lot; whilst, at the same time, the Government, by
an adoption of some such policy, will doubtless
eventually be well reimbursed.
In relation to the issuing of grants for—
III.—Indian Reservations,
Which belongs to the " Private Land Claim"
branch of this office, I have the honor to report,
that the business is steadily progressing, and the
General Land Office is prepared, on demand, to
issue patents in all cases where the requisite evi-
dence of elementary title has been rendered to this
office.
Under the Choctaw treaty of 1830, patents are
issued to the Indian residents for" reserves, under
the 14th article, and under the 19th article or sup-
plement, either to the reservee, where he has not
sold his interest, or to the"first purchaser from
him, when the sale has been approved.
In respect to the numerous reservations under
the Creek treaty of 1832, there are some instances
in which grants issued to the reservees themselves,
but by far the greater portion are cases in which
the reservees have sold their rights, and under the
act of Congress it is required that the patents shall
issue to the last purchaser, in virtue of regular
assignments.
This requirement has devolved mnch.laborupon
this office, in the examination of claims of title,
not unfrequently complex and embarrassed, grow-
ing out, in many cases, of purchases made by
companies from the Indians, and afterwards trans-
ferred; and, in others, of rights which have been
the subject of controversy, oY of judicial inquiry
and determination.
In several other treaties with Indian tribes, in
which the reservations are less numerous than
those ^bove mentioned,such as the Pottawatomies,
Winnebagoes, Miamics, &c., the form of patent
has of course to be adapted to the peculiarities-of
sucfi treaties.
For the more numerous reservations under the
Chickasaw treaties of 1832 and 1834, the grants
issue to the reservees themselves, and purchasers
from the Indians hold in virtue of such grants,
and of approved deeds by the Piesident.
In regard to the Chickasaw cession, the United
States, as you are aware, undertook the sale of the
lands for the benefit of the Chickasaws, and in
1833, and subsequently, " regulations" on the
subject were adopted, and approved by the Presi-
dent.
Pursuant to those regulations, this office was
charged with the general direction of the surveys I
and sale of the land, with the auditing and adjust- j
ing of the accounts of the principal surveyor, and j
of the receiver of public moneys in the cession, (
and with ihe issuing of patents for the reserves and
general sales.
The cession embraces, as heretofore reported,
six millions seven hundred and eighteen thousand
five hundred and eighty-six acres, and twenty-
seven hundredths. After satisfying the reserves,
which cover over a third of the cession, the residue
of the land has be^n exposed to sale, the "land
office section" excepted; including all the isolated
tracts which, at the date of my last annual report,
were unoffered, they haying since been brought
into market in the manner then proposed. More
than nine-tenths of the land which was liable to
^ale in the cession have been sold, leaving less
than one-tenth of it now in market unsold, the
most of which has graduated to the lowest rate
specified in the treaty, being 121 cents per acre.
There have been made out for sales in the ces-
sion, and for reserves, twenty-three thousand eight
hundred patents; and semi-annual reports as to
the progress of the business up to thirtieth June
last, have been regularly communicated from this
office to the Indian Office, War Department.
In the 11th article of the treaty of 1834, refer-
ring to the periods of graduation therein specified,
it is provided as follows: " But as it may happen,
' in the fourth and after years, that the expenses
' may prove greater than the receipts, it is agreed,
' that at any time after the third year, the Chicka-
' saws may declare the residue of their lands aban-
' doned to the United States; and if so, they shall
' be thenceforjli acquitted of all and every expense
' on account of the sale of the same;" and in the
5th article of the supplement to that treaty, it is
declared, that "whenever the President shall be
1 of opinion that the services of any officer em-
1 ployed under this treaty for the sale of lands can
' be dispensed with, he will, injustice to theChick-
' asaws, and to save them from unnecessary ex-
' penses, discontinue the whole, or such as can be
' dispensed with."
Under this last stipulation, the services of all the
officers at Pontotoc, Mississippi, connected with
land operations at that place, which is the seat of
the local office in the cessitin.have been dispensed
with, except the register and receiver, whose com-
pensation is fixed by the treaty; and therefore the
sales and general management of the business will
necessarily procced as at present, until either the
cession is sold out, or the contingency alluded "to
in the aforesaid 11th- article of the treaty of 1834
shall occur, or other measures shall be prescribed
by further treaty stipulations or by legislation.
IV.—Proclamations of Land Sales.
Since the last annual report from this office,
there have been proclaimed for sale; exclusive of
school lands:
In Ohio, the unsold, improved Wyandot lands.
In Michigan 2,662,218 acres.
In Wisconsin  877,963' "
In Iowa 1,928,317 "
In Missouri 1,410,049 "
In Arkansas  937,864 "
In Louisiana  281,961 "
In Florida 1,361,369 "
Making a total of. 9,459,741
The quantity now surveyed and prepared for
market, but the greater part of which cannot be
offered for sale at present, for the reasons men-
tioned in the details and notes of exhibit, is
4,716,375 acres.
The quantity of land estimated for survey, the
township plats of which are expected to be re-
turned during the year 1849, is 9,113,400 acres;
which is about the usual average quantity annually
i surveyed and brought into market for several years
| past.
Numerous sales of detached tracts have been
ordered, under the authority conferred on this of-
fice by the fifth section of the act of 3d August,
1846; and measures have been adopted to offer the
balance of these lands at the earliest practicable
period. There is a ciass of these detached tracts,
however, over which this office has no control;
and settlers; consequently, are frequently prevented
! from entering them, and thus securing their homes
j and the fruits of their industry. Reference is here
made to lands which have been reserved for mili-
tary and naval purposes, and which are no longer
! needed or useful for those purposes. Under the
actof:3d March, 1819, the Secretary of War is
authorized to dispose of lands which have been
reserved for military purposes, and which become
useless for those purposes; but no authority of
law exists for the sale of those which have been
reserved for naval purposes. Except where valu-
able improvements are situated on these lands,
they will not yield more than the ordinary mini-
mum, and hence will not justify the expense of
sending a special agent to dispose of them. It
is therefore respectfully recommended, that this
office be authorized to dispose of those lands in
the ordinary mode, or under such regulations as
may be required for the interests of the Govern-
ment so that the value of the improvements shall ~
be secured to the United States, in addition to the
price of the lands. '
v.—Sales of Public Lands, Locations of Choc-
ta* Certificates, Late War Warrants,
Mexican War Bounty Land Warrants, etc.
During the calender year 1847, there have been
sold of the public lands, exclusive of the errone-
ous entries, 2,521,305.59 acres; for which there
was received in payment, cash $3,201,284 08, in
treasury notes $20,452 01, in treasurer's receipts
$73, in military land scrip $5,196 81, in forfeited
land stock $92 68, and in Choctaw certificates
$69,306 50, up to the 30th June, 1847, when they
ceased to be received as money, making the gross
amount of purchase money $3,296,404 08: and
during the first, second, ana third quarters of the
calendar year 1848, there were sold 1,448,240.51
acres, for which there was received in payment,
in cash ^,2,018,032 71,-in treasury notes $8,094:95,
and in military land-scrip §4,540 64, making the
gross amount of purchase money "§2,030,668 30.
There have been located with " Choctaw certifi-
cates," distinct from the ordinary sales for cash,
from the 1st of July to the 31st December, 1847,
55,903.79 acres; and during the first, second, and
third quarters of 1848, 42,083.44 acres; and in
October, 1848, as far as the returns have been re-

There have been located jvith bounty land war-
rants, under the act of May 6, 1812, for services
rendered in the late war with Great Britain, during
the calendar year 1847, 37,440 acres; and for the
first three quarters of the year 1848, 3,84$ acres.
The number of outstanding " certificates of loca-
tion," issued upon warrants of this class, under
the above recited act, which have not as yet been
returned as located, is 137, embracing 21,920 acres,
being for 160 acres each:
The act of July 27, 1842, entitled " An act to
provide for satisfying claims for bounty lands, for
military services in the late war with Great Britain,
and for other purposes," which had expired by its
own limilation, has been again revived by the act
of June 26th, 1848; and the time for issuing this
class of warrants extended to the 26th of June,
1853:
.With Mexican war bounty land warrants, under
the 9th section of the act of February 11, 1847,
during the year 1847, 250,320 acres; and foi; the
first three-quarters of the year 1848,1,525,200 acres:
Making the whole amount of the public lands
disposed of by sales and locations, for the periods
aforesaid, 5,887,550.11 acres.
According to a statement from the Commissioner • 
of Indian Affairs, dated November 30,1848, 3,832
Choctaw certificates have been issued under the
act of"Congress of August 23, 1842, calling for
700,240 acres, and transmitted for delivery1 to the
claimants; of which, according to the latest re-
turns, 1,843 certificates appear to have been deliv-
ered. Of the amount thus issued and delivered,
1,559 certificates, calling for 279,140 acres have,
according to the latest returns to this office, been
absorbed in the location of 277,376.14 acres of
land in the four States of Mississippi, Louisiana,
Alabama, and Arkansas, in which only they are
by law receivable, leaving 421,100 acres yet to be
located.
The first Mexican war warrant issued from the
Pension Office, a branch of the War Department,
under the 9th section of the act of Congress of the
11th of February, 1847, for 160 acres of land, is
dated the 19th of March, 1847, and was registered
m this office March 20, 1847. The first warrant
for 40 acres bears date the 7th of April, 1847, and
was registered April 8, 1847.
Since that time, and uplo November 30, 1848,
warrants have been issued for 160 acres each, to
the number of 39,825, for 6,372,000 acres of land;
and for 40 acres each, to the number of 3,349, for
133,960>acres; making the whole number of Mex-
ican war warrants issued, up to the 30th of No-
vember, 1848, 43,174, embracing 6,505,960 acres
of land.
Of this number, 10,793 warrants for 160 acres
each, and 1,216 warrants for-40 acres each, calling
