General Rosecrans on the one side and General Curtis on the other will render it impracticable for Price to send troops far north on the Missouri River without rendering it certain that they would be destroyed, or to separate his army in the face of the concentration on both sides against it.

MAJOR: I beg leave to transmit the report of Captain R. C. Olin, assistant adjutant-general, who was ordered by me to investigate the facts in relation to the departure of the men of the Eighth Minnesota Volunteers, who have absented themselves without leave. it appears that the whole movement was kept entirely secret from the officers and was carried out in the night with probably feeble opposition, if any, on the part of the guard. I have no doubt the men who have thus rendered themselves amenable to military punishment were advised to take the steps by citizens who were in and about the camp during the previous day, as many of them expressed their opinion quite freely of the hardships of sending the regiment South after a long and wearisome campaign without any opportunity being afforded officers and men to see their families. Measures have been taken to collect the stragglers as speedily as possible, so that I have good reason to believe they can begin their march in six or seven days. I have the pleasure to state that Companies C, G, and K have behaved admirably; they are all in camp, but one man of the last-named having absented himself, and he has since returned. I need not state that the unexpected breach of discipline which has occurred in a regiment heretofore distinguished for good conduct and obedience to orders has mortified me not a little, and causes deep regret and humiliation to the officers, who seem to have been thus placed in an exceedingly embarrassing position by a manifestation of confidence in their men, fully justified heretofore in similar cases, but which has been in the present instance grossly abused.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
