at Newport News or at other points I can make good use of them in case the rebels cross the Nansemond. Had you not better order the One hundred and eighteenth and One hundred and thirty-ninth [New York] temporarily here?

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S. -It is said to be a movement in concert with that on New Berne. How about the artillery from Fort Norfolk?

COMMANDING OFFICER SIXTH CORPS:

Dispatch from Major-General Birney states that the pickets of his First Division report a considerable body of infantry moving in their front to his right. The pickets of his First Division are on the right of your pickets. Has any report of the kind reached you?

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 15, 1864-3. 45 p. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER SIXTH CORPS:

I think there must be some mistake in the report from the pickets of the Third Corps. I telegraphed General Pleasonton at once. He has received no information of any kind. I have just sent directions to General Merritt to send out a force to ascertain what the report means. General Pleasonton is at Stevensburg reviewing cavalry. General Meade has returned.

Have you received any dispatches from patrols respecting such a movement as that reported from General Birney's pickets?

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General MERRITT:

General Birney reports that his pickets report a considerable force of infantry passing the front of his First Division toward his right. His First Division pickets unite with those of the Sixth Corps. The major-general commanding directs that you send out a force immediately to ascertain the truth of this report.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
