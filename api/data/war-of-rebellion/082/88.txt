Brigadier-General RAWLINS,Chief of Staff, City Point:

More than one week since I had the honor to forward certain papers for the consideration of the lieutenant-general commanding the armies of the United States. These papers had reference to the condition of the negro troops, and I deemed the suggestions of importance to the service. I have, therefore, respectfully to request that the major-general commanding the Department of Virginia and North Carolina may be called upon to forward those papers, which were sent to the headquarters of the armies through the headquarters of the department.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

Is it not possible to send me some troops to relieve a portion of my line? My troops are so exhausted it is very difficult to make them work.
