Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Departments of Arkansas, Little Rock, Ark.:

SIR: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to request that you will be pleased to relieve the Fourth Brigade of the Reserve Corps (or such portion thereof as you think can be spared with safety) from duty on and at the mouth of White River, and order it to proceed to this with the least possible delay. The senior officer upon each transport to stop at Morganza for the purpose of telegraphing to these headquarters the probable hour of arrival and the strength of his command. A small portion of the funds due the troops in the pay district of the Gulf is about to arrive, and the Fourth Brigade will probably receive four months' pay immediately upon arrival here. The good news from Tennessee obviates the necessity of keeping any portion of the reserve Corps in General Dana's department, and the First and Second Brigades have therefore been ordered down. If your can possibly spare the whole of the Fourth Brigade be pleased to do so.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
