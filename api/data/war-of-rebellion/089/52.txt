[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Inclosed report of deserters from Thirty-fifth North Carolina was forwarded to you yesterday and returned again unknown to me until this moment.* A deserter from the same regiment has just been forwarded who came in on Saturday night. He reports the position of Johnson's division unchanged, lying from the Appomattox to the Burnside mine. He is certain that Hoke's division went across the Appomattox last Thursday, but knows nothing about their returning.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. BABCOCK.
