C, First California Volunteer Cavalry, is already at Hart's Mill, as you had doubtless heard previous to my arrival. There are many matters of moment which required my attention, as I have heard, in the neighorhood of Fort Bliss.

[Inclosure K.] GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. COLUMN FROM CALIFORNIA, CAMP ON RIO GRANDE, Numbers 16. Near Fort Quitman, Tex., August 22, 1865.

I. At 12 m. to-day Captain John C. Cremony, with his company (B, of the Second California Volunteer Cavalry), will proceed to Fort Quitman and hoist over it the national colors the old Stars and Stripes. By this act still another post comes under its rightful flag and once more becomes consecrated to the United States.

II. Captain Edmond D. Shirland, First California Volunteer Cavalry, will proceed without delay, yet by easy marches, to Fort Davis, Tex., and hoist over that post the national colors. If Captain Shirland finds any sick or wounded soldiers there he will make them prisoners of war, but put them upon their parole and let them proceed without delay to Texas. If they are unable to travel, captain Shirland will report to these headquarters by express what they need in the way of surgical or medical attention; what they need in the way of food or transportation, and all other essential facts connected with them which it may be necessary to have known to have them properly cared for. If the fort is abandoned, Captain Shirland will retrace his steps and report in person to these headquarters.

III. Twenty effective men will be ordered from Company B, First California Volunteer Cavalry toreport to Captain Shirland for detached service to Fort Davis, Tex.

By order of Brigadier-General Carleton;

Many of the horses beng unfit to proceed farther, I thought it best to go on from here with twenty men and picked horses, taking the ambulance with me.
