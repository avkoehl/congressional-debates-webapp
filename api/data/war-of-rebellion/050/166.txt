September 22, 1863-4.10 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

I have just counted four rebel regiments of infantry and one battery coming down Mission Ridge at a gap south 80 degrees east of this point. There are also other forces on the ridge that have been standing in the road for two hours.

I am, captain, very respectfully,

W. LEONARD.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, September 22, 1863-5 p.m.

General MITCHELL,

Commanding Cavalry:

The general commanding directs you to pass to the north side of the river with all your force except Minty's brigade. You will carefully watch all the fords and ferries above as far as Harrison's, and down as near Bridgeport as you may deem necessary. Mass your force at some convenient point, so that you can defend any point at which the rebels may attempt to cross. Use your artillery to assist you in holding any threatened point. Look out for corn and let us know where it is. Patrol the road from here to Bridgeport, on north side of the river, frequently. Send scouting parties above Harrison's daily-and oftener at irregular intervals, if you deem it expedient-to watch for any attempt of the enemy to cross. Colonel Wilder's command is now over the river on duty similar to that you are ordered to perform. Until further orders it will report to you. Report frequently.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
