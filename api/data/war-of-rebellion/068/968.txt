MAY 7, 1864-12 m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL:

GENERAL: I have reached the Germanna plank road at Beale's house, having possession of Beale's house. I shelled about two regiments of cavalry away, much the larger portion traveling rapidly toward Fredericksburg along the plank road, and the balance fleeing down the same road toward the ford. I have seen nothing but cavalry. I have thrown out a line of skirmishers toward the Spotswood house. This position can't be held, except with a large force. With the present force I can't hold it.

Very respectfully,

A. L. LONG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

PICKET-LINE FIRST NORTH CAROLINA CAVALRY, May 7, 1864-2 p.m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL:

The enemy about an hour go took up their pontoon bridge at Germanna Ford, and moved off hurriedly in the direction of Ely's.

W. H. CHEEK,

Colonel First North Carolina Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, May 7, 1864-7 p.m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: General Lee directs me to say that he has instructed General Anderson to put Longstreet's corps in motion for Spotsylvania Court-House as soon as he can withdraw it from its present position. He will proceed either by Todd's Tavern or Shady Grove Church, as circumstances may determine. The general desires you to be prepared to follow with your command should it be discovered that the enemy is moving in that direction, or should any change in his position render it advisable.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-General Lee will be at Parker's Store to-night. Rodes is closing in to Hill.

MAY -, 1864.*

General EWELL:

Fitz. Lee reports the enemy within 5 miles of Fredericksburg. We must try and attack his rear. Move your corps along as far as prudent. Is Early ready to follow? Cavalry will replace your pickets. Let me know what opposes you.

LEE,

General.
