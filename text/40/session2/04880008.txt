APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[November,
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
Report of the Secretary of War.
40th Gong....2d Sess.
The amount of "abandoned land" now in
possession of the bureau is 215,024 acres, much
of which is swamp land, and scarcely any afford-
ing revenue. The number of pieces of town
properly is 950.
The business of adjusting the claims of col-
ored soldiers has greatly increased in good
results. The total number of claims presented
during the year is 5,535, of which 755 have
been finally adjusted, and 4,266 are now await-
ing action in the Treasury Department. The
amount collected apd paid to claimants has
been $64,494 29; certificates received by the
Commissioner and ordered paid, under act of
Congress approved March 29. 1867, amounting
to $890,712 99.
Transportation has been furnished to 778
refugees, and to 16,931 freedmen to enable them
to reach places where they can. provide for
themselves. Teachers and agents have also
received transportation. Railroad accounts for
transportation have been audited amounting to
$102,093 99, and the amount paid by the dis-
bursing officer has been §227,754 63.
Hospitals are being rapidly closed and dis-
pensaries substituted as a more economical
mode of giving relief to the sick. The number
of refugees treated during the year ending
August 31, 1867, is 8,853, of whom 196 died, or
2.2 per cent. The number of freedmen treated
is 135,296; died, 4,640, or 3.4 per cent. The
number of commissioned medical officers and
private physicians employed by the bureau has
been 178, of whom 105 were on duty at the end
of the year. No adequate provision has been
made for the insane, either by State or munici-
pal authorities, but they are cared for in sepa-
rate wards of bureau hospitals. The average
cost of furnishing medical attendance and
medicines during the year has been §2 73 for
each patient.
The total expenditures for the medical depart-
ment have been $301,800.
Commissary supplies have been issued to a
limited extent. It has been found impracti-
cable to discontinue such issues altogether.
The average number of rations for the year
ending September 1, 18G7, was 11,658 per day.
In the latter part of winter the destitution be-
came so great that urgent appeals were made
for a more general distribution of supplies.
The total amount of supplies furnished by means
of the ''relief fund" has been 850,388 pounds
of pork and bacon, and 6,809,296 pounds of
corn. The number of persons receiving relief
is reported to have been 233,372. The average
number has been 58,000, the largest number
being, in July, 82,000. The whole expense has
been $445,993 36, i. e., nearly $8 to each
person for the period of four months, or $2
per month. This special relief was discontin-
ued in August, the funds and supplies remain-
ing on hand being reserved for those who may
require help during the coming winter.
£he Schools have increased in number and
usefulness. Normal and training schools are
well attended. The total of day and night
schools reported, including industrial, but not
the Sunday schools, is 2,207, with 2,442 teach-
ers and 130,735 scholars; an increase of 40,000
since the last annual report. Of these, 1,056
schools are sustained wholly or in part by
freedmen, and 391 buildings are owned by
them. Of the teachers, 699 are colored and
1,388 white.
The average amount of tuition paid per
month by the freedmen has been $14,555.
Ft nances.—-Appropriation for the year end-
ing July 1, 1868, $3,836,300.
Total expenditures from October 1, 1866, to
August 31; 1867, eleven months, 53,597,397 65.
The principal items of expenditures are:
for schools and school buildings, $553,9)5 79;
subsistence stores, $1,460,326 28; for trans-
portation, $227,754 63 ; salaries of agents,
clerks, &c., $521,421 44 ; medical department,
$331,001 21; quarters and fuel, $135,098 64;
elothing, $110,688 80.
The balance of the expenditure, $251,-
190 86, has been for printing, postage, and
other contingencies.
The surplus from the unexpended appropri-
ations of 1866, with the balance of the appro-
priations of this year, will be sufficient for the
purposes of the bureau during the present
fiscal year ending June 30, 1868. In addition
to the above proper expenditures, the disburs-
ing office.1 has paid back to colored soldiers,
or their heirs, retained State bounties to the
amount of $51,720 83, and has paid claims of
colored soldiers, under joint resolution of Con-
gress approved March 29, 1867, to the amount
of $350,870 96.
Apprenticeship in Maryland still holds large
numbers of colored children in virtual slavery.
The evils and cruelties resulting from this sys-
tem, sanctioned by the State laws, are mat-
ters of constant complaint. As many as two
thousand cases have been presented in a single
county.
Education.—In all the schools in the Dis-
trict of Columbia and West Virginia there
have been 7,998 scholars and 229 teachers.
In West Virginia the schools have been sus-
tained in part from the public school fund,
where an impartial system of free schools
exists. In the District of Columbia the col-
ored schools are also entitled to a proportion-
ate share of the public school fund, but the city
authorities have not yet paid the entire sum
claimed. It is probable, however, that the
trustees of the colored schools will recover all
that is due, and in future receive an equitable
share of the public funds, in which case the
colored schools will be independent of the
bureau. Several institutions of higher grade
than common schools have been established,
and have made a good beginning. Among
these are the National Theological Institute,
in Washington, under the auspices of the Bap-
tist denomination ; the normal school and col-
lege at Harper's Ferry, conducted by the Free-
will Baptists, and the Howard University, in
the District of Columbia, which is designed to
be national and free to all. The normal and
preparatory department has been opened with
about sixty scholars, and buildings are now
being erected for other departments.
To provide cheap homes for industrious col-
ored men, a farm has been purchased, surveyed
into acre lots, and sold at cost. The lots have
been taken up rapidly, and payments upon
them promptly made.
Expenditures have fallen below the original
estimates. No further appropriation of funds
is asked for. As the bureau will expire next
J uly, unless extended by Congress, no funds are
estimated for for the next fiscal year. In case
the bureau is not extended, it is recommended
by the Commissioner that proper arrangements
be made with the State authorities for the care
of indigent classes ; that the educational woik
be continued under the direction of the Bureau
of Education or other United States agency,
with full power and means to maintain and
extend the present system ; and that the Claim
Division be continued in connection with the
War Department as long as it may be deemed
necessary by the Secretary of War.
This is but a brief abstract of the report of
the Commissioner of Refugees, Freedmen, and
Abandoned Lands. Special attention to the
report itself is respectfully invited. No recom-
mendation is made at the present time respect-
ing the continuance or discontinuance of this
bureau. During the session of Congi ess facts
may develop themselves requiring special
legislation in the premises, when the neces-
sary recommendations can be made.
ADJUTANT GENERAL.
The report of the Adjutant General of the
Army shows the organization and present
strength _ of the Army, the force stationed in
each military department and district, the num-
ber of recruits enlisted, and desertions from
October 1, 1866, to September 20, 1867, and
the organization of the colored troops.
On the 30th of September, 1867, the aggre-
gate strength of tho Army (officers and men)
was 56,815; the number of recruits, 34,191;
and desertions, 13,608.
The recruiting service has been very success-
ful, and men have been supplied as fast as
needed.
The greatly enlarged numbers of the Army
and of the military posts occupied by it render
it necessary that some change should be made
in the present system of courts-martial and of
punishments. The organization of "compa-
nies of discipline'' is recommended. It is also
recommended that, for the good of the service,
the term of enlistment be changed from three
to five years. In the cavalry it is five years,
but the other arms of the service only enlist
for three.
At the date of the last report 11,043 volun-
teers still remained in service. That number
has been reduced, and now only 203 commis-
sioned officers remain, and no enlisted men.
These officers are kept by special acts author-
izing retention of volunteers in Freedmen's
Bureau.
The mustering and disbursing officers have
all been discontinued, except at Albany, New
York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Columbus,
Ohio; Louisville, Kentucky; St. Louis, Mis-
souri ; Santa F6, New Mexico; and San Fran-
cisco, California. No appropriation is required '
for the volunteer disbursing branch for the next
year.
Attention is called to the great number of
desertions, and the necessity for a change in
the present system of courts-martial and of
punishment to abate the evil.
I would recommend an increase of three
assistant adjutants general. This would en-
able the assignment of one to each of the major
generals and brigadier generals of the Army,
and avoid the necessity of detaching officers
from their legitimate duties to act as assistant
adjutants general.
INSPECTOR GEN EE All.
During the year there has been no change
in the inspector general's department, except
that two of the assistant inspectors general
have been promoted from majors to lieutenant
colonels, under the provisions of the act of
Congress approved July 28, I860. The num-
ber of officers in this branch of the service is
too small to properly make the required special
and stated inspections, whereby manv abuses
and irregularities have crept into the" service.
The immediate organization of an inspection
department, composed of competent, active
officers, is respectfully recommended to the
attention of the authorities.
THE CHIEF OF THE BURE4.U OF MILITARY JFSTICE
reports that in the Bureau of Military Justice,
during the past year. 11,432 records of mili-
tary courts were received, reviewed, aud regis-
tered ; 2,135 special reports made as to the
regularity of judicial proceedings, the pardon
of military offenders, the remission or commu-
tation of sentences, and upon the miscellaneous
subjects and questions of law referred for the
opinion of the bureau. The only change made
in the conduct of the bureau and the status
of its officers during the year has been in the
detailing, by the order of the Secretary of War,
of the assistant judge advocate general and
four judge advocates for service at the head-
quarters, respectively, of the five military dis-
tricts established j;y the act of Congress of
March 2, 1807. From official reports of tho
district, commanders and other communications
it is bclmved that the services of these officers
nave been of an important and valuable char-
acter. The satisfactory manner in which they
arc_ represented as having performed their
duties, which have been both of an advisory
and judicial character, is deemed especially to
vindicate the policy of Congress in retaining
