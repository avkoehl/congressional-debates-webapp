chases the tracts he wishes to buy, and pays for it
in proportion to its value, or as there may be bid-
ders who come into competition The proceeds of
this sale are divided amongst the company, and thus
the speculators realize all the profits of your auc-
tion system. This is your^ auction system This
is the system which has been so much and so con-
stantly lauded in this chamber, as one which could
not be improved, and ought not to be changed
Whilst those who advocate the pre-emption system,
which has dohe so much towaids the opening and
settling of your wild lands, are bitterly com-
plained of as promoters of the most lawless
course of conduct on the part of men who
are denounced as criminals of the worst description1
Why, sir, these criminals, as they aie called, would
compare, m point of worth, integrity, and enter-
prise, with the very best or. those who denounce
them. They are not known to Senators, or they
would pot be thus spoken of. Arkansas was or-
ganized as a Territory when nearly all her citizens
were settlers upon the public lands Go to your
land offices, and you will find that men who have
been members of Congress, and have filled the
highest stations in the old States, have settled upon
public land, and have proved up and got a title to
their lands as pre-emptioners For g"nero iiy, ca-
pacity to endure hardship, and noble daring, no
people are equal to the pre-emptioners who seme
upon the wild lands of the West ¿nd South They
go there poor and penniless, (having expended
every thing in reaching the wiHetnes*,) with their
wives and children, and in a year or two, you find
them occupying a snug cabm, with a cultivated
field, and surrounded by every thing necessary to
support life. Prom ilus humble beginning, with
industry and perseverance, they soon become inde-
pendent, and in time become the best and worthiest
of the inhabitants of a new country. It was to se-
cure a home to such settler  as he had described,
that the commitiee had reported the original bill.
It was to save all such from falling into the power
of the speculators in the public lands that he telt so
anxious for the passing of ihe bill. He since, ely
trusted that if nething would be done to give free-
dom, sovereignty, and independence to the new
States, the Senate would, as a simple act of justice,
protect the settler against t'-e power of the specu-
lator.
He did not see how any Senator could vote
against the pre-emption bill. They had all voted
for it, some as a separate measure, others when m-
corporatedin the distribution bill, and others when
it was included in the bill ior ceding the lands to
the new States. A great deal had been said against
it as a distinct measure, and its evils had been de-
picted in the strongest language. It had been de-
nounced as an attempt to seize upon the public
lands; and the enterprising settlers had been com-
pared to public depredators He had listened to
these assaults upon the honest and ínilu'tiious citi-
zens of the new Stales with pain and mornfleation,
and he felt assured that no such language would
have been used towards them, if they were known
to Senators as they were to him. He felt assured
that they would not be regarded as the less worthy
and respectable by their neighbor  and friends, on
account of such denunciations. But what struck
him with much force, was the circumstance that
those who had thus abused the settlers on the pub-
lic lands, had voted for the distribution amendment
which offers to the settlers double the quantity of land
which is secured to them by the pre-emption bill.
He still hoped that the amendment which pro-
poses to cede the lands to the new States, would
find favor with the Señale. If not, he felt sure
that the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. Crittenden] would be rejected, and that the
simple pre-emption bill of the Senator from ^Mis-
souri [Mr. Benton] woald pats the Senate by a
decided vote.                                                      ,

Mr.  President  The question now before the
Senate is one of great importance to the country.
ms
Senate.
The bill reported by the chairman of the Committee
on the Dis net of Columbia proposes simply to re-
vive and continue m iorce the expired charters
ef six of the banks of this District, without any
change in ihe powers and privilegts granted by
those charters. The amendment I have offered, ana
upon which the question is now to be taken, pro-
poses to place the banks of this District upon the
same foundation of equal privileges and equal
competition with every other establishment, cor-
porate or not corporate, in the District; it propo-
ses, in fact, to introduce the punciple of free trade
into the banking business of the country; to with-
ho'd from the business of trading in money or
credit what is withheld from all other business ear-
ned on in the community—its monopoly character;
and, while the busmesss itself is permitted to re-
main under the protection of the law without other
restraint ihan the public safety requires, to with-
hold from its conduc'ors any special public recog-
nition oí their exclusive fitness for the business,
and the endorsement of the legislative power that
they, and they alone, are worihy of all trust and
confidence in conducting their manufactories.
This bill is brought in upon a petition of the
bankers of this Distuct and ih ir friends and de-
pendents; the petition is signed by about two hun-
dred names, the population ol this D strict is com-
pu.ed to be upwards of 60,000, probably it is
80 000, so that not one eightieth part of the adult
male population ask for the passage of this bill.
And what, Mr. President, are the powers and pri-
vileges these people ask lo have revived and con-
tinued1 They ask, first, the power of making and
putting afloat the whole (irculatmg medium of the
District, wi'h tne privilege of levying a tax en Jhe
community ol Le'ween six and seven per cent, for
us use, aid, a  ihe power to issue papei in the laws
sought to be revived is unlrmited, so the power to
levy a tax tor its use is lo be unlimited. Second,
they ask that their money may, by our legislation,
be enhanced in value to as great extent as they
think proper, or rather that their stock notes (for
they ate not bound to have a specie capita') may
have an unlimited value given to ihem over the
gold and «ilver of then lellow-cmzens And, last-
ly, they a«k to be formally, and, by anticipation,
exonerated from all liability to pay any debts they
may eon'ractin ihis highly favor<d business.
It, s r, wc now approached this subject for ihe
fii"5' ume—if ihe e manufacturers of paper money
now were for the first t me, m ihe world's his'ory,
asking us lo bestow upon them thee privileges, io
the cxcluson oí all others, it would strike us, not
merely wnh astonishment at toe audaciiy of iheir
ímpudenc , but wpha strong sense of the ludicrous
lhat ihey «bould calculate so largely upon our un-
bounded simplicity. Suppose (hat gold and silver
had formed the enlue circulation oí the country
from time immemorial, that no oiher had been in-
vented, and some scheming John Law were to ad-
dress a memorial to you, setting lor h, m ihe style
of ohr bank ora'ors, he great sipmurity of paper
over goid and silver for a cpcuUtmg medium, and
praying for the exclusive privilege of manufactur-
ing such papes and puit'tig it m the hands of every
body—of levying a tax tor the use of it equal to
six per cent ptr annum, payable every sixty days
m advance—that this paper might be allowed to re-
piesent credit, not money—and, finally, that the pe-
titioner might be expressly exonerated by law from
any lability frr the payment of his debts, beyond
the money he should p ace in his own chest for that
purpose—with wnat go«d humored surprise, sir,
you woaid receive sucl an application'
Nothing pro\eo more conclusively that indivi-
duals and nat'ons aie governed by habit, than our
use ot the paper oí incorporated companies. We
have acqu red this habit by slow and imperceptible
degree', and now ¡hire are intell gent and dismte-
reste I men who really believe, not mer ly taat this
manufactory ought lo be protected, but that it
ought to be p« t>cted by a monopoly and by exemp-
tion from liability upon its obligation . I am not
so visionary as to a ie npt to change the habit of
u> ng paper for money, but, be'itvi )g that this ha-
bu is becoming injur ous 11 the public interest and
subversive of morals, Í \ra for taking from the mo-
ney power its tendency to evil, while all its capacity
