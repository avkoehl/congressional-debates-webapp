They will be in readiness to move immediately, and will take the cars for Clarsburg, W. Va.

CUMBERLAND, September 27, 1864-10 p. m.

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling:

Colonel Wilkinson reports Weston and Buckhannon both in the possession of the rebels, and a force of 1,500 near Philippi. I have stopped the Seventeenth at Grafton, but the colonel advised me he left Wheeling without ammunition. Will send some by morning train. I have sent all the force I can raise, which is very small, being left with this extended command almost without troops. I fear for the worst results.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.
