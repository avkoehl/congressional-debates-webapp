Lieutenant Colonel T. T. CRITTENDEN,

If the steamer Cora is at Boonville send her to this place. If not, leave an order to that effect, and move at once with your command to this post. The general commanding does not understand why you failed to report from Tipton or California, as directed.

By command:

Colonel J. D. CRAWFORD,

Will send you ammunition and provisions by the first train. Have no arms to send. You must gather all arms that can be had.

By order:

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 1, 1864.

Major E. S. FOSTER,

Warrensburg:

The enemy are reported moving toward this place. Measures are taken to give them a fight. I think they will be broken up before they get west of Sedalia. Collect every armed man in the country and be prepared to harass them. Don't let the enemy get the arms or horses of the citizen guards. If the enemy move west you know how important it is that I should have information of their movements. Chester will report to you.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
