Managers on the part of the Houhp.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on agreeing to the report ot* the com-
mittee.
Mr. SHERMAN, This is what is com-
monly called the funding bill. Senators will
remember that as it passed the Senate it con-
tained four sections. The first prescribed the
classes of bonds; one at twenty years at five
per cent.; one at thirty years at four and a
half per cent.-, and one at forty years at four
per cent., in which the debt of the United
States was to be converted. The second sec-
tion provided for a sinking fund of $135,000,000.
The third section legalized gold contracts. I
The fourth section prohibited the payment of
percentages or commissions on the exchange
of bonds. The House of Representatives
added several new sections. They struck out
the section in regard to gold contracts, and
changed the first section so as to provide for
the issue of bonds running forty years, at an
interest of three and sixty-five hundredths per
cent. This disagreementcamo before the com-
mittee of conference extending to nearly all
parts of the bill. The result of the conference
has been that we report a bill of three sections,
providing for the second and third classes of
the bonds prescribed in the Senate bill, omit-
ting the first class; so that the bill provides
for bonds running for thirty years at lour and
a half percent., and forty years at four per
cent., principal and interest payable in gold,
and of precisely the legal character stipulated
in the Senate bill, free from all tax except the
income tax levied upon other incomes m the
United States.
Mr. YAN WINKLE. Are they redeemable
before maturity?
Mr. SHERMAN. They are not redeemable
until after maturity, payable at the pleasure of
the United States after thirty and forty years.
The second section, providing for the sinking
fund, is led as it passed both Houses, the
amendments of the House being verbal in char-
acter.
The third section provided for gold contracts.
The House disagreed to that, and the Senate
conferees, with great reluctance, finally yielded
that section.
The fourth section is substantially as it passed
in the Senate, simply adding the word ''re-
demption" alter the word u negotiation."
The House rccede from all the other sections
that they added to the bill. There were four
of them, I believe, making new provisions in
regard to the public debt. If Senators wish
any further information about it 1 have the
bill as it will stand according to the report of
the committee, and as the matter is of great
importance, I will ask the Clerk to read the
bill, as it is short, as it will stand if the report
is adopted.
The Chief Clerk read us follows :
An act providing for tlic payment of tho national
debt, and for the i eduction of ilio rato of interest
thereon.
Be it ouictcrf, That the Secretary of the Treas-
ury is hereby authorized to issuu coupon or r> gis-
tered bonds of the United States, in t-uch loim as ho
may proscribe, and of denominations ot S1UU, or any
multiple of that &um, redeemable in com at tlic
pleasure of the United States alter thirty and forty
years, respectively, and beuung the following rates
of yearly interest, payable semi-annually in coin,
that is to say : the issue of bonds tailing due in thirty
years shall bear interest at four and a halt per eont.;
and bonds falling duo in forty years shall bear in-
terest at four per cent.; which said bonds and tho
interest thereon shall be exempt trom the payment
of all taxes or duties to the United States other than
such income tux as may be assessed on other incomes,
as well as from taxation in any form by or under
State, municipal, or local authouty, and the s>aid
bonds shall bo exclusively used, par lor par, lor the
redemption of or in exchange for an cjual amount
of any of the present outstanding bonds of the Uni-
ted States known as the live-twenty bond-, and may
be issued to an amount, in the aggregate, sulheient
to covcr the principal of all such live-twenty bonds,
and no more.
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That there is
hereby appropriated out ot the duties derived from
imported goods thesum of $135,000,000 annually,which
sum, during each fiscal year, shall be applied, to the
payment ot the interest and to the reduction of the
prmcijjal of the public debt, in such a manner as may
be determined by the Secretary oi tho Treasury or as
Congress mny hereafter direct; and such reduction
shall be in lieu ot the sinking fund contemplated by
the fifth section of the actentitlcd " An act to autnoi-
ize the issue of United States notes, and lor tho
redemption or funding thereof, and funding the float-
ing debt of the United States," approved i'ebiuary
25,1862.
Sec. 3. AndbeitfurJicrenacted, Thntfrom and after
the passage of this act no percentage, deduction, com-
mission, or compensation ot any amount or land
shall be allowed to any person for the sale, negotia-
tion, redemption, or exchange of any bonds or securi-
ties of the United States, or of any coin or bullion
disposed of at the Treasury Department or elsewheiu
on account of tho United States; and all acts and
parts of acts authorizing or permitting, by construc-
tion or otherwise, the Secretary of the Treasury to
appoint any agent, otherthan some proper officer of
his Department, to make such sale, negotiation
redemption, or exchange of bonds and securities, are
hereby repealed.
Mr. CORBETT. I wisli to make an inquiry
of the Senator from Ohio. I notice that the
committee have stricken out the words '' at the
option of the holder." 1 desire to inquire
whether or not the Secretary has a right to
compel the present holders to receive these
bonds in exchange for the five-twenty bunds
that have matured, the five years having
expired?
Mr. SHERMAN. I will answer that simply
in the negative. There is no such power in the
bill or anywhere else. We do not make these
bonds legal tenders in the payment of debts.
The exchange must be voluntary.
Mr. CORBETT. " Par for par," as I under-
stand it, and it seemed to me there might be
such a thing as exchanging tbera not at the
option of the holders, but compelling them to
take them. It is very difficult to judge of the
precise character of the bill from hearing it
read in this way. I should like to have it
printed. It is a very important matter.
Mr. SHERMAN." I will state that no change
has been made in the legal effect of the section
referred to as it stood in the Senate, and as it
was agreed to in the House. The House have
inserted some words and stricken out others.
It is to be a voluntary exchange par for par
between the present bonds and the new bonds.
Mr. CORBET P. To test the sense of the
Senate, I move that the bill be printed as pro-
posed to be amended by the conference com-
mittee.
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senate can do as
they please about that. Asa matter of course
that would defeat the bill, because the House
of Representatives meet at nine o'clock in the
morning, and we shall have no time to got the
bill and report printed. The Senator, with his
known sagacity and shrewdness, I have 110
doubt can see exactly the provisions of the
bill without having it printed.
Mr. BUCKALEW. I do not understand
how much of the existing public debt may be
putinto the bondspioposed in this bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. The five-twenties ; none
others. About sixteen hundred millions will
be the aggregate. •
Mr. BUCKALEW. Then it is substantially
as now presented by the committee, a bill to
change the five-twenties into four and a half
and four per cent, thirty and forty year bonds,
free Irom all forms of taxation.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I notice thatth e last sec-
tion of tho bill prohibits any compensation
being allowed for the transaction of this busi-
ness by any outside agent of the Government:
but there was in the old conversion a fruitful
source of income in permitting the bonds of
the Government to lie on deposit in the hands
of the agent. This is not remedied. I am
not willing to let the matter pass without the
Senate understanding that if the old practice
is carried out of the Treasury Department, per-
mitting these bonds to remain out 011 deposit
prior to their being sold, one half per cent, or
one per cent, could very easily be made by the
parties negotiating them.
The report was concurred in.
