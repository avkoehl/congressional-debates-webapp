APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 25,
Ho. op Rips.
The Tariff—Mr. Kelley.
41st Gong....2d Sess.
officially to the knowledge of Parliament. I
have before me the report of a parliamentary
commission which proves, that notwithstanding
our duties on iron and steel, our knives and
forks, horseshoe nails, &c., are crowding Eng-
land out of general markets, that our hoes,
shovels, and axes are bought, by the people
of all her colonies; and that our locks, sew-
ing-machines, and other productions of iron
and steel are underselling hers in the streets
of London and Birmingham. There is the
"report from the select committee on scientific
instruction, together with the proceedings of
the committee, minutes of evidence, and ap-
pendix," ordered by the House of Commons
to be printed 15th July, 1868. It is a ponderous
volume and replete with instruction.
I find on page 479 a paper handed in by
Mr. Field, containing a "list of some articles
made in Birmingham and the hardware dis-
tricts, which are largely replaced in common
markets of the world by the productions of
other countries.'' The author states that'' this
list might be immensely extended by further
investigation, which the shortness of time has
not permitted." Among the articles enumer-
ated are hoes—and I ask the attention of the
gentleman from New York [Mr. Brooks]—
"Hoes: for cotton and other purposes, an article of
large consumption."
On this article the report remarks:
"The United States compete with us, for their own
use and to some extent for export."
Then we have the following:
"Axes: for foiling trees, &c., an article of large con-
sumption. The United States supply our colonies
and the world with the best artiolo."
Then there are:
"Carpenters' broad-axes; carpenters' and coopers'
adzes: coopers' tools, various sorts; shoemakers'
hammers and tools."
With regard to these "Germany and the
United States" are mentioned as the countries
" whose products are believed to have replaced
those of England."
Speaking of cut nails, the report says :
" United States export to South America and our
colonies."
And, with regard to horseshoe nails, which
we protect by a duty of 5 cents per pound, and
the manufacture of which under that ample
protection has been cheapened and so perfected
that this parliamentary report announces that
they exclude the English from common mar-
kets because they are—
"Beautifully mado by machinery in the United
States."
Mr. WINANS. Will the gentleman allow
me to ask him a question?
Mr. KELLEY. Not at present. I will be
glad when I have got a little further into my
subject to answer, but not at this point.
Mr. WINANS. My question comes in prop-
erly here.
Mr. KELLEY. I will hear the gentleman.
Mr. WINANS. I understand that the pur-
port of what the gentleman has been reading
is to show that the United States, notwith-
standing the high tariff 
Mr. KELLEY. I do not yield to the gentle-
man for a speech. If he has a question to put,
let him put it squarely.
Mr. WINANS. I merely wished to make
a preliminary remark. But, without any pre-
liminaries, my question is this: If, under the
operation of our tariff', American manufac-
turers could compete with British manu-
facturers in British markets, why should the
high tariff be maintained to oppress our own
people?
Mr. KELLEY. The gentleman's question
will be abundantly answered as I proceed.
But I may remark here that if by protection
you secure to your capital and industry a cer-
tain market, capitalists will invest in the erec-
tion of workshops, purchase of machinery.
and by high wages will induce skilled and ingen-
ious workmen to leave their homes and accept
employment on better terms among strangers.
Thus under protection capital has been invested,
and skilled laborers gathered, and our inventive
geniushasimprovedthemethods of production,
until we have come to be able to make the arti-
cles mentioned in this list cheaper than free-
trade England. But withdraw this protection,
and you will enable foreigners, with the im-
mense accumulations of capital they possess,
to combine and undersell our home manufac-
turers for a few years, and thus destroy them.
The purpose of a protective tariff is that of the
fence around an orchard in a district where
cattle are permitted to run at large. I believe
I have answered the question of the gentleman.
The gentlemanfromNew York [Mr. Brooks]
said that his heart glowed with pride when in
a distant foreign land he saw a camel robed in
American muslin. The value of the kind of
muslin used for such a purpose is almost all
in the cost of the raw material; it is woven of
the coarsest yarn. I wish he had been in
Abyssinia in 1867 ; how his pulse would have
quickened and his heart expanded as he saw
that while England was wreathing the latest
glory around her brows by moving an army
into the heart of Abyssinia for the relief of a
few of her subjects, the ingenuity and protected
industry of the United States was providing
that army with water from day to day.
For proof of this I turn again to the Parlia-
mentary report. It says: " Pumps of various
sorts largely exported from the United States.''
Note, "an American pump finding water for
the Abyssinian expedition." Those pumps,
unlike the coarse cotton, the sight of wnich so
rejoiced the gentleman, involved a preponder-
ant percentage of labor—labor for the digging
and carrying of the coal, ore, and limestone,
and on through successive grades of labor to
their completion, so that probably 90 per cent,
of their cost was labor. I submit the list en-
tire for the gentleman's consideration.
