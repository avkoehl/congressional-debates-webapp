SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 29, 1863-4 o'clock.

General GRANT,

Vicksburg:

Flag of truce not yet in. General Asboth reported and assigned to the Third Division, late Tuttle's. Nothing new. All quiet.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 29, 1863.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant adjutant-General:

At what time to-day will the general leave? I expect the flag of truce back to-day, and it might be well for him to hear what news they bring in. The party with the flag was ordered to go to Clinton and thence to Canton, the point from which Jackson dated his last letter to me. From their absence I infer they met no lines of the enemy at Clinton. I ordered them not to regard any scouts or patrols, but to demand unobstructed passage up to the enemy's real lines.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 29, 1863.

General McPHERSON,

Vicksburg:

Dispatch received. I have ordered the matter inquired into, and, if true, to send a couple of regiments out 2 miles east of Baldwin's to burn the house of some known secesh. They must stop these marauders. Did you receive my dispatch yesterday inquiring about Judge Marshall, of Vicksburg, his house, &amp;c.?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 29, 1863.

General DENNIS,

Railroad Bridge:

General McPherson says a negro reports that a squad of guerrillas crossed at Baldvin's Ferry, killed a negro, and returned, proposing to come again. Have the matter inquired into, and, if true, send a couple of regiments across and out a couple of miles, with orders to burn the house of some known secesh, and give notice it will be repeated as often as they please. I will be down to-morrow.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
