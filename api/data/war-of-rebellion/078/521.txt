General GRANGER,

Decatur:

A strong DIVISION has gone up the road, and will act against Forrest, either from Huntsville or Decherd. General Thomas will also be on hand, and will give all orders. Only don't scatter too much or try to hold too many points. We will have some heavy re- enforcements from the North.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

DECATUR, ALA., September 29, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Telegram has been received. I have left only fifteen men in a block-house, just enough to prevent their being burned by guerrillas or bushwhackers. I have kept all my available force constantly on hand to operate wherever threatened. I think I can hold any important point. Athens could not have been taken if Starkweather had gone there, as he promised, or if Campbell had not been a dammed coward.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, September 29, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Following telegram has just been received:

NASHVILLE, September 29, 1864.

The enemy has gone to the Nashville and Chattanooga road. General Rousseau's cavalry follows.
