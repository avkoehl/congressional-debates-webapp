THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

was worthy of being brought out in the debate to
be commented on
But, as the gentleman  seems to challenge a
compauson of the degree of information which
we íespectively possess, I will run the parallel a
little furthei     I have shown that neis as ignorant
as I am (boriowing his phraseology) of facts    I
now propose to convict him of an ignorance of a
more important character    Unless he has better
reasons to assign for his declaration that the Sec-
retary of the Treasury ought to be impeached
than any urged here to day, he is ignorant of the
principles of morals and law by which the con-
duct of that officer should be tued     The proof
he has adduced is to be found in document No
297    It furnishes in many, if not in all cases, par-
tial testimony only   We learn from it that certain
public officers stand chaiged in the books of the
Treasury Department with laige sums of money,
placed mthen hands foi disbursement and, also,
that the Secietaiy and other officers of that De
partment have made repeated calls in vain upon
these disbuising officers for a final settlement
of their accounts     But this document does not
give us the letters of those officers in reply    We
know not what apologies they have offered for de
lay     They may have unadjusted claims against
the United States  to set off    They may need
vouchers for e%.pcndituies yet to be procured
With this state of facts, the gentleman under-
takes to charge the Secretary, not only with neg-
ligence, but with willful misconduct, with mal-
feasance of a grade justifying impeachment, be
cause he has failed to dismiss all those officers
Surely this proceeding is in violation of all law
and of sound morals     No man who has been in
public employment could have escaped impeach
ment, if the gentleman has to day madt out a
case justifying such a proceeding    In support of
this, cabes innumeiable could  be produced      I
will content myself with one known to the whole
counüy     Por many years, the late James Mon
roe,  whose   peisonal  integrity   wis  never  mi
peached  stood  charged upon the  books of the
Treasmy  with  about eignty thousand dollars
According to thp record, he could have been ai
raigned as a defaulter
Mi    WISE     Mi   Monroe never was a de-
faultei
Mr THOMAS íeplied, I know that, and am
about to refer to facts in proof of it But while
his accounts were unsettled, and a balance of
public money was m his hinds unaccounted for,
he could have been styled a defaulter with as
much propnety as that epithet can be applied to
many who aie now anaigned Mr Monroe in
the course of time, settled his accounts, when he
satisfied the accounting officer that the United
States weie in fict indebted to him Was Mr
Monroe, on account of this tiansaction, excluded
fiom office' Did he not,on the contiary.subse
quentlynse from giade to grade of public appoint
ment, until he reached the presidential chair>
And were the men who promoted him guilty of
high crimes and misdemeanors' Let it not be
supposed that I am justifying the proceeding of
the Secretary of the Treasury, or pissing judg-
ment upon those men who are said to be public
defaulters I am doing no such *hing I have
undertaken simply to show that the gentleman
fiom Virginia is ignoiant of the pnnciples upon
which an impeachment should be based, unless he
has othei evidences of guilt besides those exhib-
ited to day But is it not time to be done with
declamation and invective (for which the gentle-
man has much talent) upon this subject'
If the Secretary bt guilty, let the gentleman
bring foiwaid a specific, tangible chaigc Let
him submit a icsolution declnmg that therein,
and then the Secietaiy of the Treasmy did in act
calling for his impeachment, and therefore I ar
íaign him befoie the bar of this House and before
the bar of public opinion Let this be done, and
I pledge myseK solemnly to do justice in the
matter I know that I have party attachments
They are strong I cannot but feel a partiality
for men with whom I have fought miny a haid
battle in what we esteemed a good cause But I
know that I can divest myself of all piejudice,
and give an impartial vote, when the issue is made
up in due ftim between the Secretary and his
ae useis
Befoie I close my remarks I desire to saya
very few woids m reply to the gentleman from
South Carolina, [Mr Thompson ] He much
mistakes m supposing that I intended to palliate
the defalcations of the friends of the Administra-
tion by showing that their opponents were no
better
In repelling the assertion that the friends of
this Administration dreaded the publication of a
list of the names of these defaulters, I referred
to the known fact that there are on the list men
of both political parties now existing, and of all
parties which have ever existed in this country
These men were not put in office by General
Jackson and his successor alone Some of them
have been appointed by each of the other Presi-
dents of the United States This circumstance
was adduced to show that no particular party has
cause to dread the publication and republication
of these documents Let them be published, and
let us, instead of criminating and recriminating
for mere party purposes, profit by the past, and,
looking to the great and vital mteiests involved,
guaid, if we can, against a recurrence of similar
evils hereafter But let not the fi 'ends of econ-
omy now, or any time hereafter, be driven or
dragooned into a lavish and extiavagant expend-
iture of money by printing an unreasonable num
ber of comes of any document whatever Gen-
tlemen tell us there are three hundred and seventy
thousand votéis in New York, and nearly an
equal numbei in Pennsylvania Well, what then ?
Are we to publish one copy of these documents
for every voter in the United States > No man
has pioposed a measure of that monstrous char-
actei Then, if that is not to be done, some
medium between no publication at all and the
printing of millions of copies of large documents
must be adopted, md that medium seems to be
to print a sufficient number to furnish with a copy
each editor of a penodical or newspapei each
legisiitoi, and each pu jlic library in the Union,
a id leave a few copies to each member of this
House for "eneral distiibution When that has
been done we should touch the public money no
fuithei If a more gencial diffusion of mfoima
tion than is to be hid heie is desirable, each
membei can, out of lus own piivate funds, get
the means and in expenditures of that ehaiactei
my constituents have nut had, and will never
have, cause to tharge me with parsimony
Mr  MERCER had heard with gi tat regietthe
name of Mr  Momoe introduced m this debateas
having been a defaulter to the Government     It
I might, pei haps h iveansen fiom the circumstance
that he had mentioned, at his seat, that, as far
back as the administration of Mr   Madison, it
had been the piactice to publish the names of de
faulteis  and that Mi   Monroe s name hid been
so published     He might hive added  the name
of limothy Picketing also  which was published
under i simihr cha ge     The ¡ ubueation of Mi
Momoe happened in a singulat manner     A box
of public  account books  had been wheeled, on
its wav to another place, into the office of Bcrja
I mm Franklin Bache    of Philadelphia, editor of
the Aurora, who had copied the debit side alone of
' Mr  Monroe's account with the Government, in
which it appealed he was dtbtoi to the amount of
<>80,000, and  puohshed  it in  that panei     Mr
Momoe was then sick in Albemarle county, Vir
gima, yet he arose from Ins bed and mounted
his horse, drew out his account and immediately
had it settled     This was a different matter f om
the final settlement of his account after leaving
j the Presidency      Kwas  he custom of the Tieas
[ ury to chaige a pub'ic officer with all the sums
paid him on account of his  salirv, and not to
ciedit him by hi  sei vices  hence he stood on the
books as a debtoi, w hen he did not owe a far-
tlnno-     This migl t occasion some oí the state
I ments in Document No   111   which had created
such amazement     Mr  M  sud he had no idea
that these cases had the slightest analogy to those
of these land receivers   and he would undeitake
to say that a moie scandalous conespondencehe
| had never listened to in his life than that which
I had taken place between these men ard the Sec
I retary of the Tieasuiy, and he was prepared to
1 sustain an impeachment of that officer whenever
it should be moved in the House
| Mr BOON said the epithet of "corruption '
had been so long and so often charged upon the
late and present Administrations of the Genual
' Government, ooth in and out of this Hall, that it
had now become an old song, stripped of all the I
influence upon the public mind, for which so
I many unfounded charges had been made, and ten
I thousand times reiterated, without ever one of
them havinf been sustained by even the shadow
of poof    Mr   B  said this system of chaigmg
upon the Administration coiruption by wholesale
had been persevered in for years past, m every
possible manner, and what, he would ask, had
been the íesponse from the people in eveí y quar-
ter or section of this Confederacy >   I (said Mr
B ) have been listening to hear some reference
made by those who originated those charges to
the recent general elections which have taken place
in some twelve States of this Union since the ad-
journment of the last panic making session of
Congress, to show that those charges are believed,
and that the Administration is condemned by the
people     But, Mr Speaker, I have not heard the
first allusion made by the Opposition to the late
popular elections which have taken place in those
States, and where the measures of the Admims
tration were made test questions in the election of
Representatives to the next Congress > Sir, these
vague charges of corruption, made against the
Administration, have been passed upon by the
people of twelve States since tne last adjournment
of Congiess, and they have said, by their late
I election for Congressmen and other offieeis, that
they do not believe one word of all that has been
said and published against the Administration and
its leading measures   A gentleman near me, fiom
Kentucky, [Mr Williims,] mentions the State
of New York as  not having given a favorable
response at her late elections to the measures of
the Administration     Be it so     Yet eleven other
States, in which general elections have been held
since the panic making session of Congress, have
I given unequivocal demonstrations of their entire
j confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the
1 Administration, and of then approval of its gen-
eral polity, including the independent Treasury
measure
I     With a full knowledge of these uneiung facts,
| the eloquent and talented member from Missis
I sipppi [\Ii   Prlmiss] declared in his place, but
a tew moments since, that he will continue to ring
I m  tnc ears of the Administration paity the cry
of " coriuption'" " corruption '" " corruption '"
so long as he is a member of this House, and
aftci his public services shall have closed here, he
j will still cry •'conuphon'"   This cry of coirup-
tion has been loud and long proclaimed in this
I Hall of the people's Representatives, and he had
supposed that no gentleman could be elected to a
seat on that floor whose word would not be taken
j as liuth by his constituents, yet it would seem
I tint some gentlemen wished their word to be m-
doised by the publication of a document from a
1 Goicinment officer'
|     Mr B said he would vote against the printing
I of an ttha, number of these documents, which
had been once printed by order of the House,
i simply because the only possible good that could
or would be obtained by the punting of an exit a
number of them would be a useless and extrava-
gant expenditure of the public money, which
could in nowise benefit any person save the Pub
lie Pnnlti     To him it would be a fat job, and
then it would be charged by the Opposition as
I ano'lier item of wasteful and extravagant appro-
puation of the public money on the part of the
Administration     In reference to the oft lepeated
charse of coirupuon on th<> part of the Admims-
ti ation ,why, I ask, do not gentlemen thus vaguely
chaieing, bring forward specific cnarges with a
view to have those who may be found guilty pun-
' ¡shed and lemoved <"iom office by impeachment
or otherwise '   Until this shall be done, the cry
! of coiiuptwii here oi elsewheic will fall dead upon
[ the public ear   As to the "pickingand stealing"
' fiom the puohc Treasury, charged by thegentle-
I man fiom Vnginia, [Mr  Wise,] Mr  B  said he
| somewhat suspected   from íecent developments,
I that before all was ov er, it would become matter
of dispute whether theW'/iigsor Conservatives had
I "picked" or stolen most from the public Treas-
I ui y     They seem to be the great whales in this
business of "picking and  stealing" from the
Treasuiy, as has been charged by the gentleman
fiom Virginia, [Mr Wise ]  That there has been
public de faulteis under the present and former Ad-
ministrations, was not to be denied, and the like
ma) be e ipected so long as there shall be public
I money collected and disbursed, whether through
