objects; whilst every antagonist policy will render
their attainment less and less hopeful, and will be
productive of eril, and that continually.
This policy is not only the most effectual to limit
the revenue and avoid a surplus; but—
It will operate to diminish the indirect patronage
of the Executive, without increasing the direct.
The former is more t  be dreaded than the latter,
because it is more hidden and lets understood.
The bill supersedes the agency of all banks, and
keeps the Government funds at command of the
people's Representatives, to be used when they or-
der it, without danger of a spasmodic effect on the
currency.
It will tend to make the paper money sounder,
by temo\ iog from the banks the pretext or most
fioiuul cause of irredeemable issues; consequently
to ibai extent it will prevent convulsions in money
matters, changes in the reUtions of property and its
owners, and will produce more uniformity in
prices, and soundness of pay to labor and its pro-
ducts.
It cannot injure any of the Sute banks, because
it can only take and withhold from them what is
not theirs, and deny them the power of abusing
what they ought never to use—the public money.
For the same reason it can never injure the pru-
dent and honest merchant or trader of any de-
scription.
The benefits of this measure are not addressed
peculiarly to any leading interest whatever. They
are to be diffused more especially amongst the
planters, the farmers, the day laborers, and me-
chanics; because the permanent circulation rests
habitually in their pockets. Every loss on it is
their loss, and the saving of a loss is their gain.
Whatever, therefore, diminishes the use of the ar-
ticle on which they most lose, and substitutes that
by which they cannot lose, is interesting to them.
This measure does that.
It does not address itself to the interest of the
shaver and broker, as some, for effect, have de-
e'ared. They fatten on a multiplication of credits,
and the derangement of currency. Hence, in such
times, every bank has its broker. Reduce the for-
mer, or make uniform the latter, you cut off
their speculations, and make their business and
profits as regular and unform as those of the mer-
chant, the banker, or the planter.
If I be asked, sir, how I arrive at these and other
conclusion, which 1 shall presently state, I answer,
by inquiring into the nature and objects of modern
banking.
First, I find the object to be to make money
without the use of money.   How is this done?
1.    It is done by using the corporation credits to
the most unlimited degree, consistent with the safe-
ty of the stockholders.
2.    By getting possession of as much of ano-
ther's money as possible, keeping it as long as
possible, making the best use of it for the time,
and finally paying for it in any thing but money.
Hence, he who can get hold of the most money,
keep it the longest, make the most of it, and in-
vent the most ways to return it, without giving up
the thing itself—maintaining all the while a repu-
tation for fairness, prudence, and safety—is esteem-
ed the best modern banker.
The keeping, receiving, and paying out the pub-
lic money (independent of banks) is the subject of
this bill. The keeping and using of the public
funds by the banks, or through tbeir agency, is the
policy of the Opposition, to wit, the Whigs.
The public deposites constitute the bone of con-
tention. I beg the committee to fix tbeir eyes on
this single idea, and follow it in all its applica-
tions; for sartling remits will be exhibited to some
at least, when I shall have fully answered the fol-
lowing inquiry:
Why is it that the friends of the banks are so
hot in pursuit of the deposites, raising a great hue
and cry when they are removed, charging Govern-
ment with all the evils resting on the land, in-
duced by superabundance of irredeemable cur-
rency?
Do not the people believe that bank notes are
based on, and tbeir circulation governed by, the
capiat or money of the banks, a reasonable por-
tion of which is supposed to be specie?    They do.
Hence the universal idea with the mass that a bank
is a strong, a safe thing. Hence the planter or far-
mer who has no borrowing to do, puts his money
on deposite for safekeeping.
What will be the surprise of this confiding por-
lion of community, when I assert, and prove, that
the entire circalation of the Union is based on, or
governed, not by the specie in the vaults, not by
the amount of capital paid in, but by the average
deposites held by the banks?
That this is not only true of the United States
Bank, but that its aggregate annual circulation,
during the twenty years of its existence, was go-
verned by the aggregate amount of publio money
held by it.
This, sir, is literally true. And the average de-
posites during the period of that Bank's existence,
was as true an index to the circulation as the dial is
to the sun's course, when no cloud obstructs its
shining—as just, sir, as the thermometer to indi-
cate the heat—swelling as they increased, and con-
tracting as they diminished. I will prove this by
witnesses not to be distrusted, the Bank's own con-
fessions, which are to be taken always most strong-
ly against itself.
This will furnish a true development of the real
cause of all our distress and suffering, and may
serve to suggest the appropriate remedy.
Now for the proof. Ii is taken from the Bank
returns exhibited in the public documents. In Se-
nate doc. 2d sefs. 25th Cong. No. 128, p. 208.
The proposition is, that the circulation of the
United States Bank, from 1817 to 1836, was go-
verned, not by its capital, not by its specie, but by
the average amount of public money on deposite.
Here is a semi-annual rtatement of that Bank
for January and July of the several years, taken
from that document, under the respective heads of
capital, specie, deposites, circulation, loans, and
discounts:

By this statement it appears that from 1817 to
1833,
The annual average circulation was -   #9,341,246

You will remember, sir, in 1833, the deposites
were removed.   That was a crisis with the Bank
and the country.   Hence our estimates are made
to that date, and from that date to the expiration of
the charter.
From 1833 to July, 1836, the time it expired,
The annual average circulation was - #20,294,903
Do.      do.     deposites           -     2,639,580

Now, Mr. Chairman, the universal complaint is
the derangement of the currency, pressure, and hard
times. Whence arise these waitings, and how
shall their true causes ,be shown? 'Tis a vexed
question, out of which politicians expect much
profit to arise. The paper money has been aptly
styled the circulating medium, from analogy to the
blood in the human system. The expansions and
contractions of the former correspond in effect with
the diminution and stagnation of the latter. As
you would place the fingers on the pulse to test the
superabundant action in the arterial system or ap-
proaching state of collapse, so you may now
place your finger on the column headed circulation,
and tracing its action from year to year, mark the
coincidences.
The experiment will prove what I have said—
" That the average annual circulation of the United
States Bank for the time it held the deposites, was
governed by, and based upon, the public deposites;"
not by its capital, not by its specie.
How stands the case? The circulation was nine
millions, the deposites eight millions, and the
specie was five millions, in round numbers.
The amounts, therefore, of the two first
most neaHy correspond. But, it may be
asked, cannot five millions of specie sustain
nine millions of circulation? It may be. But who
knows but the five millions of specie is part and
parcel of the eight millions of deposites, and so far
is identical? I do not say it is, but have very lit-
tle doubt, because, in addition to the eight millions
of Government deposites, the bank bad an average
annual private deposite of five millions during the
same time. But this is wholly immaterial. I do
not deal in surmise, for I will now show by the
tabular statement, that the circulation expanded as
the deposites increased, and contracted as they
diminished; whilst, in reference to the specie, the
circulation expanded when the specie was low, and
contracted when it was high. This will prove, be-
yond the power of contradiction, that the public
deposites governed the circulation of this Bank.
The Bank started cautiously. In 1817 the range
from ten to twenty-four millions was so wide, as to
furnish no criterion. During this and the next year,
the circulation ran up to 9,045,448, on a specie
