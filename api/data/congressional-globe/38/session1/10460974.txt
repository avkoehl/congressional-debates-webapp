THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 7,
Treasury, not one single cent was asked for by
the Secretary of War for a deficiency in Ins ap-
propriations. And yet now, when all the facts
relating to deficiencies must have been just as well
known to the Secretary of War in the beginning
of the session—and now that Secretary comes be-
fore the Senate, and through the Senate before this
House, without any estimates whatever being
submitted to this House, and asks an additional
appropriation of over ninety-eight millions to
make up a deficiency in the appropriations for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1864.
Why, sir, the whole expenses of this Govern-
ment in the year 1815, during the last war with
Great Britain, that contest which this then compar-
atively feeble nation carried on with the greatest
Power upon earth, were but §48,244,495. The
expenses of the Army for that war were, in 1813,
$19,662,013 02; in 1814, $20,350,806 86; in 1815,
$14,794,294 22; and yet the deficiency asked for
by the Secretary of War for one single year
amounts to four or five times the cost of any one
year of the war of 1812.
The whole appropriations of this Government
in 1847-48, the years of the Mexican war," were
but little over sixty millions per annum. The
actual expenses of the War Department were, in
1847, $35,776,495; in 1848, $27,838,374. And
that war, which was not upon our own soil, but
was costly in the transfer of troops from our own
country to a foreign country; that war in which
our troops, landing at Veia Cruz, passed on
through the tierra caliente, the hot region of
Mexico, to its mountains, to Churubusce and
Chapultepec, on to the Gareta of Mexico; that
glorious war in which we humbled Mexico and
brought the Mexicans to our own terms, cost
this Government but $35,776,495, the highest sum
in the year 1847; and yet here is a war deficiency
bill of over ninety-eight millions for the War
Department alone for one year, or over sixty-
three millions beyond what the war with Mexico
cost a year.
There is something wrong in all this; there
must be something wrong; and hence the House
should not abandon its functions, butshould look
into these expenditures, and see when, how, and
where this money has been appropriated, and
where these enormous sums of money have gone,
who have had them, in what quarters they have
been paid, why they are called for, and what they
are to effect. Sir, if these disbursements for the
War Department are to go on for three, four, or
five years longer, it will be beyond the power of
this country or of any other country on the face
of the earth to endure them.
The Secietary of War in his estimates for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, (see Treasury
Report, page 30,) asked for and had appropriated
$885,479,511. The Secretary of the Treasury,
when he submitted that report to Congress, felt
sure in his own mind that $885,479,511 was ample
and enough for all the expendituies of the War
Department for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1864, and hence not a single cent additional was
then called for either by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury or by the Secretary of War himself. And
yet here in February and March we propose
to add to this already appropriated sum of
$885,479,511, a deficiency in this bill of $98,500,-
000. What calculations are all these ? Can man
thus carry on war, or provide the men and means
for carrying on war?
More than that. Recall a little of the past his-
tory of our legislation during this session. At an
early period of the session, before the Christmas
holidays, there went through this House,in twenty
minutes by the clock, a deficiency of $20,000,000
for bounties—a million a minute—uncalled for by
the Secretary of War, or by the Secretary of the
Treasury in his estimate. I made some quiet
remarks on that occasion. I called the attention
of the other side of the House to the subject, but
I found that my remarks were not pleasant to the
other side, and I refrained from discussing the
subject at length, leaving the responsibility with
those to whom it belonged.
In a few days after the Christmas holidays, the
Secretary of War called upon us to change that
bounty appropriation of $20,000,000, ami in a
very few minutes, opposed only by an honorable
gentleman from Ohio, on the other side, there
went quietiy through a bill for bounties, which I
said then had in it $100,000,000. Now, under the
continuance of the bounty system to April 1, that
bill has in it at least $124,000,000 to be added
to the estimate of the Secretary of War. Take
not my word for it. I quote from the chairman
of the Military Committee in the Senate:
" I suppose that we have, since tbe 17th October, paid
anclagreedto pay for these bountiesirom ninety to one hun-
dred million dollars. It must be over ninety millions, for
we have paid bounties, I think, to very near three hundred
thousand men." *   * * *
" I suppose if the payment of these bounties ia extended
and we go on raising men at lbe rate we are now raising
them, that we shall raise during the coming month some-
where from sixty to eighty *iou.sand men,payings portion
of them $400 and another portion §300."
Which, counting seventy thousand men at the
average of $350 per man, will make §24,500,000;
so that if you take the actual expenditures and
appropriations of the Department as now put upon
paper as recorded in the Treasury report, at
$885,479,511, add to that $98,500,000 deficiency
and $120,000,OOOfor bounty, there will have been
appropriated for theWar Department of this Gov-
ernment alone, for the fiscal year ending30th June,
1864, the gigantic sum of $1,103,979,511.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Michigan. I wish to cor-
rect the gentleman in one respect, if he will per-
mit me.
Mr. BROOKS. Certainly.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Michigan. The payment
of these bounties is extended over the whole term
of enlistment, and only a small portion is to be
expended this year.
Mr. BROOKS. Not a small portion—a consid-
erable portion.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Michigan. One fourth, I
think.
Mr. BROOKS. What I am speaking about is
the appropriations for this year. I do not suppose
that the bounties will be all expended in the year.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Michigan. Aboutafourth
of the moneys to be expended m bounties will be
expended this year.
Mr. BROOKS. More than that. But, never-
theless, it4s the sum of money appropriated that
I am speaking of—the appropriations of Congress
for the fiscal year .ending June 30, 1864. The
more money that is saved the better; but all these
bounties are to be paid in some time or other.
I hold in my hand a record of the expenses of
the British army from 1810 to 1816, in each year
—those terrible years of struggle in which the
little island of Great Britain and the lesser isle
of Ireland were coping against the gigantic power
of Napoleon, who had taken the French armies
in triumph from the sands of Egypt to the snows
of Moscow—that little island which was subsidi-
zing all the other Powers of Europe to fight her
battles against that mighty Napoleon. The ex-
penditures of the British army in the year 1810
were $84,415,000: and in 1816,on the closing scenes
of the battle of Waterloo, they were $171,035,000.
The aggregate expenditures for the seven years
from 1810 to 1816 inclusive were $906,730,000.
The details were thus:

| But, sir, for the single fiscal year of 1863-64 we,
I who are coping with no Napoleon, with no cora-
! bination of powers for our overthrow—but when
a few rebellious States, started without resources
and full of all the elements of weakness, arc lightly
opeiated upon—we have appropriated more money
in a single year to subdue this rebellion than was
' appropriated for the whole British empire in the
six years from 1810 to 1816 to subdue the august
Napoleon, at one time combining all the conti-
nental nations of Europe for British overthrow.
I do not allude to these things for the purpose
of creating alarm or exciting the feai s of the coun-
try, only to arouse the countiy to comprehend
the magnitude of this war, and to begin now to
lay the necessary taxation to support it, so that
we may not in the future find ourselves unable to
sustain the credit of the country. That is my
object and intention in calling the attention of the
I House to the enormous expenditures of the War
! Department.
A thousand million dollars per annum, Mr.
Chairman, a billion dollars—I do not know how
ft is with others, but 1 must confess that to my
humble mind these sums are so appalling that I
caiv.,hardly begin to comprehend their gigantic
magnitude when we are called upon to transmit
them to our children as a public debt. I confess
that I often turn back to the olden times in the
history of this Government. I was here in this
House in a time when the expenditure by this
Governmentof forty-four, forty-six orforty-ejght
millions was regarded as an enormous extrava-
gance, and that was not long ago, in 1849-50,
1851-512. I recollect when the then chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, then an hon-
orable gentleman from Alabama, well known to
the present chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, educated in a country where cotton
even was not raised, but in northern Alabama,
where corn and wheat were the productions, and
where a dollar was estimated by the price of a
bushel of corn or the price of a bushel of wheat—
I recollect well how appalled he was at the enor-
mous magnitude of the expenditure by this Gov-
ernment of forty-four, forty-six, or forty-eight
million dollars. Indeed, he had a mind so consti-
tuted that members who served with him upon
the floorof the House will remember that he could
not comprehend anything above half a million
dollars. Whenever a sum came up in our appro-
priations of as much as a hundred thousand dol-
lars he was wont to be confused, but when it ran
up to half a million dollars he would often aban-
don his appropriation bill and exclaim, " Good
God, what is the country coming to?" Why, sir,
if he was here this day he would be lost in inex-
tricable confusion by these enormous .appropria-
tions for the War Department only.
Indeed, we in the great cities who are some-
what accustomed to figures, and who represent
millionaires, will soon be compelled, if these ex-
penditures go on, to bring to our aid something
more than mere arithmetic, the science of geom-
etry or mensuration say, and measure a million
by an inch, a billion by two inches, a trillion by
three inches, a quadrillion by fourinches,a quin-
1 tillion by five inches, and so on, or if that does
not present numeration or measurement sufficient
to enable us to understand these sums we shall
have to resort to the science of algebra, apply
x as an unknown quantity of expenditure, and
work with that. An equation raav be stated
thus: AB + CD X EF=X YZ=LMNOPQ..
[Laughter.]
Sir, it is becoming beyond the power of arith-
metic or the power of simple mathematics to
I compute these appropriations, or to undeistand
I the loans or systems of loans on which they are
| being founded. The whole concern anon wiil be
more puzzling than the consols or exchequer of
the debt of England.
The estimates of the War Department for 1865
are, m round numbers, $536,000,000. Sir, it is
evident from these appropriations for 1863-64 we
are now making that if this war is to continue
I these estimates for 1665 are not worth the paper
they are written upon, for the actual expenditure
of the present fiscal year for 1S64 of the War De-
partment will amount to ahnost if not quite, a
thousand million dollars—certainly, if v.-e pay up
the war warrants of the quartermasters, their cer-
ji tificates of obligation, and the great debts now
j! due to the States for money and troops advanced
i1 to the Federal Government for military services
;! rendered.
i j Now, Mr. Chairman, is it right, is it proper, is
!i it a legitimate mode of coming before the country
<■ with an estimate in December of only $4,160,581
;■ deficiency and then before the bill is perfected re-
, quire, as sanctioned by the Senate, a deficiency of
^105,000,000? I repeal, sir, is it n^ht or just to the
,, country thus to throw dust in their eyes? Is it
not wise, is it not now our duty at the start to look
this war with a!! its consequences fully in the face,
and to provide for this enormous ex pi nditure and
these enormous appropriations the oolv means
by which, if the war is to be persist! 4 in, tbe
, credit of the country can be sustained, a system
, of taxation winch shall be piopoi donate to our
expenditure? Is it just for us to kavt for pos-
tenty the full payment of tlu'se loans r Sir, un-
der a concoukuu Cabinet, oi any tiisii adrumis-
tiatior, of the Government, these discords between
estimates and appropiianons could not occur.
