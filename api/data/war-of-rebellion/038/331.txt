CAIRO, ILL., May 19, 1863.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy, Cairo:

The War Department proposes to send a force up the Arkansas River. In the absence of Commodore Porter, give all the co-operation in your power and necessary instructions.

H. W. HALLECK,

I answered it as follows:

MAY 18, 1863.

H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

I have no control over the movements of the naval forces below this station. Admiral Porter has left his instructions with Lieutenant-Commander Breese, at mouth of Yazoo River. In regard to the disposition of naval forces above Vicksburg, will forward your telegram for co-operation to him by earliest opportunity.

A. M. PENNOCK.

The dispatch has been forwarded.

A. M. PENNOCK

Fleet Captain and Commandant of Station.

BIG BLACK, May 20, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Commanding Department, &amp;c.,:

GENERAL: Since receiving your order to defend the bridges (which arrived this morning), I have just this instant (4 p. M.) received an order from General McClernand to hasten my DIVISION to the front. I am bound to presume that this is in accordance with your orders, and I shall be with General McClernand before midnight. This leaves the bridges entirely unguarded. Colonel Wright, of the cavalry, ordered by you to report to me, has up to this time failed to do so. Before receiving your order, I sent my cavalry escort out to make a reconnaissance down Big Black, but they have not yet returned.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant.

ALVIN P. HOVEY.
HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, near Vicksburg, May 20, 1863.

Major General J. B. McPherson, Comdg. SEVENTEENTH Army Corps:

GENERAL: I propose to make a charge upon the enemy's lines within an hour or two. The point of attack is on my right, and I think not far from your left. If the enemy should move out to attack my right flank, I trust you will feel justified in undertaking to prevent him from doing so.

Respectfully, yours, &c.,

JOHN A. McClernand.
HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, near Vicksburg, May 20, 1863-8 a. m.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Comdg. Department of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that General Hovey, with his DIVISION, is now about 2 miles from here; the general himself is here. My order to him was written in ignorance to him to remain at Big
