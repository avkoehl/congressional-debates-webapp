HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 1, 1864-4.15 p. m.

General MEADE:

Major Roebling sends me word that it was McLaws' division that lef the neighborhood of Woody's on the road to Cold Harbor this morning. He took a South Carolina prisoner, who says they left Shady Grove last night. I am trying to feel around the right of the force in my front, but it seems to be slow work. The ground between here an the road from Old Church to Cold Harbor is very bad and swampy, and the enemy have such a chance at our right in my front that it would be improper to attack them as long as there is any hope of avoiding it.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Bethesda Church, June 1, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

I do not believe General Smith will be up in time to take any part in an attack to-night. I will try and send in a column of a division on my let if Wright and Smith begin, and will demonstrate on my whole front. Major Roebling thought in his note that General smith could hardly do anything to-night. They will have to move out quite a piece from Cold Harbor to find the enemy's right unless it is thrown back from my front and prolonged toward Gaine's Mill. The enemy remains firm in my front, and his musketry and artillery have a fine range across a clear field, somewhat [like] our last position at Spotsylvania Court-House.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General WARREN:

I have joined my men on the left of the Fourth Maryland. They are now skirmishing with the enemy. Baldy Smith is forming on the right of the Sixth. Our left is considerably in advance of Baldy's and there is a gap of at least half a mile.

W. A. ROEBLING,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

JUNE 1, 1864-6.30 p. m.

General MEADE:

There is very heavy firing now with General Wright. I have extended well toward them, and am in communication, though I don't know how masters are going. The firing seems to be near us. Roebling just sends me this dispatch from my left 6.15 p. m.: "We are now skirmishing with the enemy. Smith is forming on the right of the Sixth. Our left is considerably in advance of Baldy Smith, and there is a gap of at least half a mile." I am skirmishing heavily on my right, and preparing to move forward at the first opportunity.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
