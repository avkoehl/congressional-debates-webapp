WARREN'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 19, 1864-7.10 p.m.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I had two engineer companies come down the Fredericksburg road during the firing. The musketry has ceased, and I shall soon have a report from Colonel Bankhead and Major Roebling, who have gone to the place. On my right on this side of the river the skirmishers pressed my line a little, and the cannon you hear is being fired at them.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 19, 1864-7.30 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

It has all quieted down with the repulse of the enemy. I have ordered a strong line of skirmishers to push out.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-8 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

You will to leave Crawford to support Kitching to-night, as Tyler's division must be withdrawn to move with Hancock. Give directions to Crawford to make his dispositions as soon as possible to permit of Tyler's withdrawal. I will allow Wright to send troops to this point to sustain Crawford in case of a renewal to-morrow of to-day's proceedings.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

General CRAWFORD:

I forward you this for your guidance. Take command of all the troops of this corps in your vicinity; they are Colonel Kitching's command, the Maryland Brigade, and two batteries. Let the battery horses have all the rest you can to-night. A negro has just come into our lines; came from Gordon's brigade, which he says are all that went over there this afternoon. Send a report back.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
