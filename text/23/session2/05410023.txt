Mi   C   udid, that it was his peisuasion, after
leading these debates, and recollecting that we
had the whole weight of theCio-vn and the Cabi-
net tluown into oui scale, that the ult mate decís
ion would be what we asked dirt \> should be
But thcic was another asocct ot the subject,
and a ve. y si nous one It was this that,should
we go to wai at this time, we must d 1 it upon a
deficient Tieaimy Noi 01 ¡y was the Tieasuryof

But it \ as plain that, if we went to wai, it would
be, in effect, with all the woild The field of
battle would be the high scs, aid tnere we nad

niiiiiueiing thirty millions of pi opio, but it w ould

suppose him to be unwilling to nsk all this, yes,

I      Ihe nation was now said to be out of debt,
'  and the fact was the envy and "dmnation of other
Governments, and the pride of oui own      But if
I   we went to war, we must instantly plunge into a
1 now debt And what would be the furthei con
se quenco' 4.S oui commerce must be destioved,
the natu'al couise of things would be to turn

it had happened dining the last wai Oui citi-

the difficulties between the northern and semthern

tleman look at such consequences, and not feel a

I Mi C observ ed that it had been his purpose
to say much moie, but that he was physically
unable He had not usen with my desire to
make a floilush, but to lccall to the consideration
ot the House the pacific lelations which had sub
sisted between thiscountiy and France for forty
five yeai's The Piesidcnt seemed disposed to
huiry Congiess into a couise w Inch must forfeit
at once all this mutual good understanding It
was not his wish to íecall scenes that were past,
although one of the Fiencli Deputies had done
so, and had adveited  to the time when the flags
I of France and Ameyea were flying in the same
field, and joined in the same cause Ho would only
ask the House to look on tint pietuie, [pointing
to the poitiait of Washington,] and then on that,
[pointing td the likeness of Lafayette ]
If the pictutes of those gte .t men could speak

I was engaged in dchbciatmg on a w ar with Tiance,

I Mi CLAIBORISL, ofVngn a, said he 1 ose to
support the motion made by die gentleman fiom
Georgia, [Mr  Ci aytox ]    He s ud he could not
! letiam fiom minting 111 the discussion of a qucs
tion so vually nitciest ng to his constituents, and
! to the woild Weie he dumb, he wouid make
an effoit to bieak the b mds of s lenco, to give ut-
teianci. to   his feelings  upon this all mipoitaiit
1 subject.    Mi. C  said he spoke on tins question
without piemeditition, relying upon the sponta-
neous feelings of Ins heait, and the best niteiests
of Ins constituents, to dneet both the matter and
manner of his addiess.    He said the winds of
heaven at tins moment weie wafting the Piesi-
dent's message to every portion of the civilized
world     It has been asserted that the message
j contained no menace—no tin eat    But I feai (said
I Mi   C ) it may bo differently undcistood by the
Tienen people, and that they may look upon it
1 as having teceive 4 the sanction of the American
nitioii     He said he believed the nation wanted,
if possible, to live 111 peace with all foro*gn Pow-
eis     It was then interest as well as duty     He
I said he had no hesitation 111 asserting that, as far
, as he had been able to ascert un public opinion,
it was aveisc to wai      The people were disposed
to hve m pcvcewith all the woild, and especially
with then ancient friend and ally, Fiance   Fiom
tins dctcimination they could not depart, as long
as they could adhere to it without a sacrifice ot
national honoi
Mi   C asked, what did the President íecom-
mc id'   He lecommended, 111 the event of a cer-
tain contingency, to wit   the French Chambers
not making the necessary appi opi íaüons eo carry
into efiect then tieaty with us, that then, and in
that event, he, the Piesidcnt, should be «luthoi-
i¿ed by Congress to make repusals on Fieneh
1 íopeiiy, to the amount of the sum stipulated to
be paid the American Goveinm«nt in (he treaty
of the 4th of July, 1831     Yes, (said Mi   C ,) to
aim him with power to seize upon the property
of innocent ai tl unoffending individuáis    Jf this
power bcconfeiied upon him, it will be virtually
conferring upon the Piesident  unconstitutional
powei—a powei to declire wai     For, disguise
the fact as gentlemen may, I can view it m no
othei light than a dcclaiation of war    Is thcie
j any gentreman on this floor who does not believe
that wai will be the inevitable consequence of the
Imcasuic    Yes   sn    it will follow with the cer-
tainty tl at thopealof thundei succeeds the electric
flash 111 the gathei nig storm     Sir, I am not afraid
to express my sentiments on theprcsentoccasion.
I am one of the íepiescntatues of the people,
and a ft ec m in     I come hei e to advocate the peo-
ple's inte est    This is the goal that I diiectall
my effoits to.   I will suppoit themeasuies of the
Admimstiation when I think them  light, and
oppose them when I believe them wiong     I am
no paitisan, and if an imputation of that  sort
should be made against me, self poised and self-
sustame d, I will s and conscious and erect     Gen-
tlemen  have lead history to little effect, if they
aie ready to clothe a single individual with the
powei   of making war     If we are to  dente
wisdom from the experience and fiom the ad-
monitions of history, we will withhold it.   The
gi anting of this powei impiovidently has earned
l  the svvoid through the fairest piovmces of the
.  woild, and biought íuin to the doois of millions;
I   When cause of war shall exist, and the honoi of
j   the nation shall demand a dcclaiation, I will, as
j   the lepresentativc of a pioud and clnvahous peo-
|   pie, join  in  meeting its honors, but, until dire
necessity shall leqmre it, I shall use all my efforts
I  to avoid it    Policy, sound moials, eveiything,
I   tells me th's is the piopei determination
But, Mi   Chan man, does the existing differ-
1 enee between the United States and Fiance pre-
sent such a case ?    In my humble judgment it
does not    AVI at,  sn,  is the state of the fact'
1 Is   not the   executive  Government  of   France
making use of evury cxeition to obtain fiom the
! Chambeis the necessaiy appropnations ?   Does
■ it 'lot already appear  to every gentleman, who
j  has given himself the tiouble to read the debates
|l in the Chambeis, that a íespectable poition of
'i that body do not rcgaid the  treaty as binding
until latifud by them, the only constitutional
powei in the Piench  Government to  levy a tax
upon the people >    We should, in the examina-
tion of this question, 1 ave some regard to the
I existing state of affairs m that countiy.    What
I would be oui si'uation, if the President and Sen-
ate were to make a treaty, and in that tieaty to
stipulate to pay a sum of money, and Congiess
j was to refuse to grmt the appi opi rations'   The
' Piesidcnt would suiely, 111 that case, recommend
the disappointed nation to stay then hand a little,
and give time to eflect a change of public opinion
