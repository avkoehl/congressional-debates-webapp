NOVEMBER 6, 1861.

I regret you did not cross with your forces yesterday. Do so as soon as practicable. Indications are that we shall make a move in force up that creek; therefore you will establish yourself solidly on that position. Men up the creek must have their tents; your supplies of provisions must be ample, and Paint Creek must be kept well scouted by hired countrymen. Offer them liberal pay for good work. maps and letters by messengers..

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT WESTERN VIRGINIA,Camp Gauley Mountain, November 6, 1861.

I do not consider you crossing the river in the rain-storm with your command practicable, but it is desirable to have them over and well and warmly encamped, with every attention to their comfort, as soon as possible. This should be done with all you troops, and with caution and secrecy. At Loop Creek it may require only cautions and careful picketing. you know what the object is, and I leave that to your judgment. The roads should be in such repair that we can send provisions if needed up Look Creek. Couriers just started with written instructions and map..

The commanding general directs me to say, in reply to your dispatch Numbers 2, that it is now too late to make crossing very practicable to-night. You have instructions as to the object of crossing, and know what the general desires to accomplish. He excepts you to use your discretion, and holds you responsible for the results. Here it is distinctly stated that he considers it too late to cross to-night. As to position in Loop Creek, it is excepted to be at or near place, so as to command its month.

The commanding general has no objections to your remaining on this side to-night. Make sure preparations to communicate with this side. Have a boat for that purpose and other arrangements made with that view. McMullin's battery goes down to-night.
