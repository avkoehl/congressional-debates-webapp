Fayette. Cleveland is evacuated. There are 15,000 troops in Chattanooga. General Schofield was commanding last night. All our forces between here and Chattanooga have gone to the latter place. I shall proceed from here to Nickajack Gap, having already sent a scout there.

Respectfully,

L. D. WATKINS,

P. S. -One hundred and eighty-seven wagons and five batteries took the left-hand road at La Fayette to Falling Water (Whiteside's) and Bridgeport. Will endeavor to destroy bridge at Whiteside's, and then make through Alabama to Atlanta. The rebels are living on parched corn. This information is obtained from James G. Brown, General Thomas' chief of scouts, who was with them, dressed in rebel clothing.

RESACA, GA., October 15, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: Hood's army left Villanow at daylight this morning in the direction of La Fayette. He has very little cavalry but plenty of artillery. He has some cavalry on Rocky Face Mountain. There are no troops between Nickajack Gap and Villanow. Inclosed I send a copy of the dispatch I sent General Schofield. I left in Nickajack Gap 100 men and the remainder of my command at Dalton. I will await further orders at this place. As I am familiar with the country around La Fayette and Summerville I can perhaps be of service to you.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

LOUIS D. WATKINS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade Cavalry.
