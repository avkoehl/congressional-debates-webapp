BALLOON CAMP,

Near Doctor Gaines" House, June 13, 1862-6.15 a.m.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS, or

General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

I ascended at 5.15 this a.m. and remained up one hour. The cannonading during the time I was up was from James Garnett's house (according to Allen's map), and directed to one of our camps to the left of General Smith's. Owing to the dense fog and smoke a view of all the roads not be obtained, but on those that were visible I could see no movements whatever. I will ascend again as soon as the fog clears a little.

Respectfully,

T. S. C. LOWE.

Brigadier General A. A. HUMPHREYS, or

General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

I have just completed another observation from the balloon. The enemy's artillery remains at the same point (James Garnett's), and, with the exception of two or three squadrons of cavalry and the usual picket, there are no other troops in position or on the visible roads. During the time of my observation the most of the enemy's shots fell short. There was no respons from our side during the time.

Respectfully,
