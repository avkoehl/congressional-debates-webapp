my right as quite strong, but would advise General Gibbon to advance during the night a strong skirmish line connecting with my right, to guard against an attempt on my artillery. This line should be withdrawn at daylight, by which time my pits will be complete.

I have seen General Birney and made the arrangement suggested by him, so that everything is now all right.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.

JUNE 17, 1864-11 a.m.

General MEADE:

I have General Cutler's division on the extreme left, with two batteries, and I believe he connects with the troops of the Second Corps. I have the other three divisions massed near the center. General Burnside's troops are all being arranged for assault. I am ready for whatever is to be done, and have been some time.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 17, 1864-12 m.

General WARREN:

Your dispatch received. I would like you to extend your skirmish line as far as possible to the left, and also to make reconnaissance, so as to ascertain the position of the enemy and the character of the ground in their front, to guide us in future operations; also send an officer and escort to examine the Blackwater Swamp, to your left and rear. If you are in reasonable distance yet, and if you want a small force of cavalry, I can send you a couple of hundred. I send them anyhow.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
