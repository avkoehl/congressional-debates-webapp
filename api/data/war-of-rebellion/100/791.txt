man's main body camped last night near Shallow Ford, on the west bank of the Yadkin. May not this column now move down that river either to Yadkin bridge (railroad) or Salisbury? Would it not be well to send, say, 500 men, under General B. T. Johnson, who is still here, to Salisbury?

JOHN M. OTEY.

[Indorsements.]

Order General Johnson to repair forthwith to Salisbury. I am surprised at his delay. Send 500 men with him by cars to break, and 500 more soon as practicable after. Order trains from Salisbury to meet troops across the break.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Yadkin bridge should be well guarded on both sides, especially on south side now.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Inform Generals Fergusion and Johnson of inclosed news.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

GREENSBOROUGH, April 12, 1865-1. 35 p. m.

Colonel OTEY:

Order the troops sent to Salisbury to leave here by any trains which may be here. Let them start as soon as possible. If no trains be here or can be had before the troops could march to the first break in the road, let them march forthwith to that point. Expedition is important. They must move with one or two days' provisions.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

RALEIGH, April 12, 1865-1 p. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON, or

I am reliably informed Vance is sending Graham and Swain to Sherman with proposal for armistice and assembly of legislature, and that Hardee g. t. l. r. t. y* them. I have telegraphed General Hampton not to let them pass till he hears from you.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GREENSBOROUGH, April 12, 1865.

The President is informed that a deputation is going to Sherman. He directs that cavalry arrest and hold the members of it for the present. No intercourse with the enemy permitted except under proper military flag of truce.
