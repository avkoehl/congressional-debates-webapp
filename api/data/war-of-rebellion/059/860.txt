HDQRS. DETACH. FIRST AND SECOND MISS. CAV.,En route Tuscaloosa, April 30, 1864.

Captain T. B. SYKES,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Inspector General:

CAPTAIN: The undersigned officer, detailed with a position of the First and Second Mississippi Cavalry and assigned to Fayetteville Fayette County, Ala., begs leave to submit the following report:

Pursuant to orders, one company of detachment was left at Wyndham Springs four days; the others sent by companies to all parts of the county. None of the parties found or heard of any armed bands of tories or deserters. There are, from a summary, between 250 and 300 deserters in county, the majority of them lying in the woods in small squads near their homes.

There were 7 captured by the detachment and turned over to the commandant of post at this place, the time not being sufficient to pursue them to their hiding-places; also 6 horses and 2 mules found belonging to deserters in the woods.

The citizens of that county, in the opinion of the undersigned, are generally loyal, but are not aiding the Confederacy, on account of inability.

The soil is poor and the people generally have nothing more than will subsist their families. A force of cavalry of any size cannot be subsisted there for any length of time without impoverishing the county. Corn is being hauled now from the prairies to make their corps and maintain the families of soldiers.

Respectfully submitted.

J. J. PERRY,

Major, Commanding Detachment.
