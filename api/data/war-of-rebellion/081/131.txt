HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 17, 1864-10.20 p.m. (Received 10.30 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

After conferring with General Terry and Colonel Abbot, and after examining the best surveys of the locality, I am of opinion that while we may carry the line in front of Battery No. 4, now occupied by the enemy, it is doubtful whether we can hold it. The advanced positions of the enemy take this line in flank, and those positions we can hardly hope to get to-night. A successful assault will therefore probably be finally repulsed. Whether or not this risk should be undertaken depends much on whether the movement is offensive or defensive. If the latter, my judgment is against it; if the former, and it can be instantly followed up by an adequate force, I should advise that the risk be undertaken. My troops are still held in readiness to move. My own opinion is that this advanced position should be taken and held only when we are prepared to take and hold the whole line on the right and left to the two rivers. Please instruct me as to what you decide in this matter.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
