HEADQUARTERS BUCKNER'S CORPS,August 30, 1863-8.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General PEGRAM,

Commanding Brigade:

GENERAL: The orders which you received to-day from Brigadier-General Forrest will not interfere with your previous instructions to fall back on Loudon.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-Colonel Hodge's command is marching in a westerly direction on the south side of the river.
HEADQUARTERS,Loudon, August 30, 1863-9 p. m.

Brigadier General N. B. FORREST,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Colonel Sheliha notified you of the orders I had received to-day, which required me to bring my cavalry to this point. The intelligence you send me does not change the imperative nature of the instructions to me. Please direct General Pegram to fall back to this point without delay.

I received no special instructions for you, but your movements should conform to those I am directed to make; that is, you should guard the Tennessee River below Kingston. The movement is a general one, and we Tennesseeans and Kentuckians will, I think, soon have an opportunity to strike for our homes. Order your trains across to the south side of the river as soon as possible. No enemy at Jacksborough. They have returned across the mountain at that point.

Respectfully and truly,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

P. S.-I am directed to send the steamers down the Hiwassee. They will go down to-night or in the morning. I will have a small guard on each, which orders to destroy them if necessary to prevent falling into the hands of the enemy.

S. B. B.
HEADQUARTERS BUCKNER'S CORPS,Loudon, August 30, 1863.

Colonel McMAHON,

Commanding Third Brigade:

COLONEL: Move at once with your brigade, artillery included, to Loudon.

By command of Major-General Buckner:

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.
