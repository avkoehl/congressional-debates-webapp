HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,Santa Fe, N. Mex., October 13, 1864.

His Excellency JOHN N. GOODWIN,

Governor of Arizona, Prescott, Ariz. Ter.:

GOVERNOR: From being obliged to muster out of service the California volunteers, it became necessary to recall from the southern portion of Arizona all the troops, except one company of cavalry at Tubac, one company of infantry at Fort Bowie, Apache Pass, and one company of cavalry and one of infantry at Fort Goodwin. Until I receive additional troops it will be impossible for me to prosecute active operations against the Apaches of Arizona as vigorously as I wish, yet I will do all that can be done with the limited means at my command.
