Respectfully referred to Major-General Stanley, with instructions o carry out so much of this order as relates to his corps.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

HENRY STONE,

Assistant Adjutant- General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 17, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch directing the movement of the cavalry has been received, and the necessary orders given Garrard; also orders to keep the enemy fully occupied to- morrow and next day.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General/
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 17, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

General Kimball report that the enemy appears to be massing in front of his Second Brigade. I have directed him to be on the alert and endeavor to detect what movement is attempted as soon as possible. Should he mass on my left it will offer a favorable opportunity to Kilpatrick.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Maj-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field,near Atlanta, August 17, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I would be glad to know the enemy is massing against General Kimball, but your signal officer at the Howard hose reports 10 a. m. that but few troops appear on the line there; that the front line seems almost abandoned, and but few people can be seen in the city; but let us watch them close until all is ready. I expect General Kilpatrick here this p. m. when I will make distinct and final orders. If General Kilpatrick starts from General Schofield's right, General Garrard's two brigades could move by the road this way, saving six or eight miles by moving by moonlight.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Near Atlanta, August 178, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Kilpatrick is here and gives me a description of his position at Sandtown that convinces me he can, in connection with 	Schofield, so effectually destroy the Macon railroad that it cannot be used in two
