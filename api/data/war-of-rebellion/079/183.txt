ALLATOONA, October 10, 1864.

General John E. SMITH,

Carteresville:

I have ordered the Army of the Ohio to and beyond Cartersville, about the bridge this side of Cass Station.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CARTERSVILLE, October 10, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

I give it as my opinion that Hood intends to capture Resaca. With bridges being gone from Rome, General Corse [is] unable to scout the country west. The garrison at Resaca is only 500, including all. Cavalry troops could be sent there by railroad to-day.

G. B. RAUM,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

RESACA, October 10, 1864 - 11. 30 p. m.

(Received 11th.)

General RAUM:

The block-house will not hold more than seventy men. Captain Seymour has 40,000 rations. Captains Coffman and Roper have not yet returned. Have no reports from citizens. Have notified Colonel Hall. Please send the detachment of cavalry up from Adairsville. Send us a map at first opportunity. No more than seventy men can be used at Tilton to advantage.

C. R. WEVER,

Colonel, Commanding.

ROME, GA., October 10, 1864 - 6. 25 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Negro just from Coosaville reports Hood crossing his army by pontoon bridges to WEST bank of Coosa. His pontoon trains arrived there last night about dark. Negro says infantry, artillery, and cavalry have all passed over it during the night. He thinks from what he can learn that they are coming to Rome. The prisoners captured say they are going to Kentucky, smashing our road as they go.

JOHN M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Allatoona, October 19, 1864.

General CORSE,

Rome:

All our armies are here ready to march at an hour's notice in case Hood crosses the Etowah. Generals Garrard and Kilpatrick are hanging about his rear, and in the present stage of water I doubt if he will attempt the Etowah, but he may. Fight your men well behind parapets,
