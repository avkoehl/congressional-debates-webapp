LEXINGTON, July 12, 1863-4.30 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

I think Judah's cavalry ought to be brought by railroad to Paris and Cynthiana to check Morgan, if he succeeds in crossing the Ohio above mouth of Kentucky River, until Sanders and Hobson can come up. Sanders will check him if he crosses below, until Judah can go by rail to Nicholasville or to some point on Louisville and Lexington Railroad, as may be deemed best. All the transportation of both roads ought to be ready and at our disposal until he crosses one of them. Cavalry is not necessary to protect Louisville with the infantry that is there now. Have you news of Morgan to-day?

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

Morgan is evidently making for Aurora or Lawrenceburg, and may possibly make this place a visit. Notify the gunboats.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 12, 1863-8.45 p.m.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

Please have all the light-draught gunboats hastened up to this part of the river at once.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, July 12, 1863.

General Commanding at Louisville:

A courier has just arrived from Captain McCormick stating that General Wallace has met Morgan between Madison and Lexington, Ind., and General Morgan was falling back in this direction. Colonel Sanders has left here with most of the command on boats for Madison. Captain McCormick thinks that Morgan would try and cross the river at Grassy Flats, 5 miles below here. Answer.

JAS. I. DAVID,

Colonel Ninth Michigan Cavalry.

GLASGOW, July 12, 1863.

General BOYLE:

I understand my regiment goes to Louisville to-morrow. Can I be relieved here, and with my men here, and with my men here go with them? Force sufficient here to defend the place without my detachment. Can place Major Quigg in command.

S. HARNEY,

Colonel Thirty-fourth Kentucky Infantry.
