HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,Whittemore's Ranch, N. Mex., January 5, 1865.

Brigadier General MARCELLUS M. CROCKER, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding at Fort Sumner, N. Mex.:

GENERAL: The general commanding the department directs me to write to you as follows: Send all men belonging to Company A, First Cavalry New Mexico Volunteers, to Fort Stanton. It is supposed that some are at you post unless they left with Lieutenant Hubbell for Fort Stanton. The general saw a Navajo woman having with her a Navajo girl, aged about twelve years, about three miles from this place. They had evidently followed an ox train which had brought flour to Fort Sumner from Mr. Moore a few days since, and this evening another Navajo woman, aged about eighteen, came into this ranch form the direction of Fort Summer. This last one he had asked Mr. Whittemore to return to Fort Sumner by the first opportunity. The general is under the impression that a great many Navajo women are inveigled away from Fort Sumner by Mexicans who come there with supplies, and that other are perhaps wandering away toward the settlements. This must be effectually stopped at once, and he leaves it with you to adopt the means. It is understood here that Doctor Steck told Mr. Taylor that the Navajoes are going off by fives and sixes every day; that the Indians told him so. One or two movable pickets commanded by a determined officer could soon ascertain whether this is true and put a stop to it. An officer and half dozen men stationed at this point to search trains might also deal of good. In conclusion, the general suggests whether in would not be better to not permit any Indians to leave the post without a written passport, these to be delivered up on their return.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ERASTUS W. WOOD,

Aide-de-Camp.
