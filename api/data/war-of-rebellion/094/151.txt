I have the honor to state, for the information of the brevet major-general commanding Cavalry Corps, Military Division of the Mississippi, that I visited the ground assigned to my division on the right of Major General A. J. Smith to-day. It is my impression that the rebels have retired their line, from personal observation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Asst. Adjt. General, Cav. Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi:

MAJOR: In compliance whit circular of this date, I have the honor to state, for the information of the brave major-general commanding, that the effective men of my command will undoubtedly be mounted to-morrow. The Sixth Illinois Cavalry is still out pressing horses, and will probably obtain a large number. The regiment is expected in to-night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Edgefield, December 11, 1864.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT:

I have the honor to report that, in obedience to your orders, I have had the Eighth Michigan and Fourteenth Illinois dismounted, and with their horses fully mounted the Sixteenth Illinois and Seventh Ohio. By this arrangement I will have about forty horses surplus, but our men are returning from hospitals, &amp;c., every day, and I think it advisable to retain them. This arrangement will leave about 750 well mounted men in the First (Harrison's) Brigade. In the Second (Biddle's) Brigade the Fifth Iowa only is mounted, about 590 men; total, 1,340. Their battery is fitted out with eight horses to each carriage, ten cannoneers, all mounted, and is in good condition for service. I have the following regiments dismounted: Eight Michigan, at Edgefield; Fourteenth Illinois, at Edgefied; Fifth Indiana, at Louisville; Sixth Indiana, at Edgefield.
