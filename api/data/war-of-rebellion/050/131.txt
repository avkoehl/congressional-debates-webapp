A telegram from Burnside, dated the 17th, just received, says my orders to move down to re-enforce you will be obeyed as soon as possible. The chief quartermaster and commissary at Saint Louis were directed to arrange for the transportation and supply of the troops sent up the Tennessee River to support your right. Burnside's cavalry ought to be near or with you by this time. I expect more definite information to-day or to-morrow.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

GENERAL McCOOK'S HEADQUARTERS, September 19,[1863]-2.15 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding:

GENERAL: General McCook had heard from a staff officer of the movement of Wood to the left. Anticipating your order, he ordered Sheridan forward to hold the position occupied by Wood. General Negley has been ordered up from his position by General McCook and a staff officer sent to conduct him. General McCook will retain General Negley here until further orders, as this position is of vital importance and is the key to our right, as the fight is now.

Very respectfully,

ARTHUR C. DUCAT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Inspector-General.
