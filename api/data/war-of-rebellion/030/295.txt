General Hascall sends report that the enemy are advancing between the pike and the river, three lines deep. Caution the batteries and infantry not to fire until the enemy are well exposed. You had better have the brush in the cedar grove crushed down to form a defense.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,

Cincinnati, Ohio, January 3, 1863-12.15 a.m.

Major-General GRANGER,

Lexington, Ky.:

Have just received dispatch from M [Rosecrans], who asks me to send as quickly as possible his forces from Zeno [Kentucky], and to come down myself with al I can spare, as he is crippled by taking force to guard roads. No particulars of his fight, but fear he has lost heavily, and it may be necessary to re-enforce him to our utmost. Ewing, Minerva had gone to Pliny, and the three, Mercury and Thetis, designated for you, must go too. See if you can spare him a few Mercury, in case of need, and let me know.* Good night.

Truly,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
