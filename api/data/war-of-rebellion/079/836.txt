HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER OFFICE, DEPT. OF ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, AND EAST LOUISIANA,Selma, Ala., October 19, 1864.

Memorandum report of Captain P. Robinson, engineer in charge, on condition of fortifications in District of Central Alabama:

Defenses at Demopolis. -Partially completed; no work going on.

Defenses at Selma. -Complete; effective against cavalry raids.

Defenses at Coosa Bridge. -Complete.

Defenses at Montgomery. -Work about one-quarter done. About 240 hands engaged. I expect to receive more implements, and to increase the force to 500 immediately. The circle of line of defenses, about 9,000 yards in length, includes eighteen redoubts and some lighter works to cover the entire ground.

Defenses at Upahaufee Bridge. -Complete.

Defenses at Opelika. -About 200 hands engaged, perhaps more by this time. The projected works are eight redoubts, one lunette, and one redan, besides one interior redoubt (complete). These works will all be in a good state of defense, if not entirely complete, by end of the present month, as I expect them to be.

Respectfully submitted.
