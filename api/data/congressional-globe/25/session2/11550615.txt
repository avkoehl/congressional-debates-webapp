tion*. I s ncere'y regiet dial, m the act^efore me, I can per-
ceive noneofthobemolncatumsof the oank charter which are
necessary, in my opinion, to make it compatible with justice,
with sound pol c- , or w th the Constitution of oit country "
'Thata Bank ol the united States, competent to all the dunes
which may be lequtred by Government, might "be so oigamzsd
as not to infringe upon our own delegated powers, or there
served rights oí the States I do not entéitain a doubt Had the
Executive been called upon to furnish the project of such an
institution, the duty woutd have been cheerfully performed
In theabsenceof such a call, it is obviously pi oper that he should
confine himself to pointing out those piomment features in the
act presented, which, m his opinion, make it incompatible with
he Constitution and sound policy "
President Jackson admub, m the citation which has just been
made, that a Bank of the United States is, in many respects,
convenient for the Government, and reminds Congress that he
had, at an early peí íod of his admmisti ation, called its attention
to the practicability of so organizing such an institution as to
secure all us advantages, without the defects of the existing
Bank It is perfectly manifest that he alludes to his previous
recommendations of a Government—a Treasmy bank In the
same Message he tells Congress mat if he had been called upon
to furnish the pi o¡ect ot buch an institution, the duty would
have been cheeiftd y peifoirwd Thus it appeals that he had
¡not only setilea m his mind the general pnnc pie, but had ad
justed t je details of a Gov f rnment bank, to be subjected to Ex
ecutive contiol, and Congies3 is even chided fpi not calling upon
him to piesent them The bill now undei consideration, beyond
all contioveisy, is the ver> pioject which he had in view, and is
to consummate the wot k which he began I think, Mi Presi
dent, that you must now concur with me in considering the first
proposition as iuliy mamtamed I pabs to the second <md third,
which, on account ot their intimate connection, I will considu
together
2   That, with a view of establishing a Government bank, it
was the settled aim and mtentio i ot the late administration to
oveithiow the whole banking bybfern of the United States, as
existing in the Um'eel States when that administration came
into power, begi mmg with the Bank of the United States, and
ending with the fetare banks
3    'l hat the attack wa* fust confined, from considerations of
policy, to the Bank of the United States, Out that, after its over-
thiowwas accomplished, it was then directed, and has since
been continued, a gainst the ^tate bank1*
We ate not bou id to inquire into the motives of President
Jackson for de=itmj to siuveit the established monetary and
financial system which he luund m oreiation, and yet some ex-
amination into tnoo-1 which piooably ínüuerced hib mind, is not
without utihry 1 he^e \\c to be found m his peculiar conbtitu-
tion and chiractei IT s ego ism and vanity piompted him to
subject every ti i o jftill lochui^e, to leirnutl, nul ie
to ich pvpiy thii g Hti re the piosuiption whichchaiactenzed
his administration, the universal expulsion from office, at home
and abroad oí all who were not devoted to him, and the attempt
to lender the Executive Department of Government, to use a
favort'e tvpiession of his own, a complete " unit " Hence his

My acquaintance with th?t cxtiaordmarj man commenced m
this city, i'i the fall of 1815 oi 1816 It wa« short, but highly
re>pectlut, and mutually cordial I beheld in him the gallant
and Miceeasfnl seneial, who hy the glorious victory of New
Oilean^ h d honoiably c^sed the second wai of our indepen-
deré and I pnl him the homage due to that eminent seivite
A íevv y pus aiiet, it became my painful duty to animadvert, m
the Hou e of Repiecentatives, with the independence which
belongs to the iepie«entative chaiacter, upon some of his pro-
ceeding in the conduct of the Seminole vvai, which I thought
illegal and contrary to the Constitution and the law of nations
A non mtercoia&e between us ensued, which continued until
the fall of 13*4, when, he being a member of the Senate, an
accommo íation between us was sought to be brought about by
the principal p*nt of the c'elegation- from bis own State Foi
that purpose, we weie invited to dme with them at Ciaxton's
boarding house, on Capitoi hill, where my veneiable fnen 1
from Tennessee [Mi \\hitr ] ind his colleague on the Spanish
commission were both piesent I retired early from dinner,
and was foi'owe 1 to the door by General Jackson and the pre
sent mm¡ tei oftl e Unfted'-Uate att1 e Court of Madrid They
pressed me eaine-üy to take a seat with them in their carnage.
My faithful servant and fcciid, CharTes waa standing at the
door, waiting for me, with my own I yielded to their urgent
politeness, directed Charles to fellow with my can lage, and ihey
eat me down at my own door We afterwards frequently met,
1 with mutual respect and cordiality, dined seveial times togethei,
and reciprocated the hospitality of our respective quarters
This friendly intercourse continued until the election, in the
House of Representatives, of a President of the United States
came on in February, 1825 I gave the vote which, m the con-
tingency that happened, I told my colleague, [Mr Critten
den,] who sits before me, prior to my departure from Ken
tucky, in November, 1824, and told olheis, that I should give.
All intercourse ceased between General Jai kson and myself
We ha\e never since, except once accidentally, exchanged
salutations, nor met, except on occasions when we weie per-
forming the last offices towards deceased merrbers of Congress
oi other officers of Government Immediately after my vote,
a rancorous war was commenced ajramst me, and al! the baik
nig dogs let loose upon me I shall not trace it during its ten
year 'bitter continuance Cut I thank my God that I stand
here, firm and erect, unbent, unbroken, unsubdued, unawed,
ready to denounce the mischievous measures of In* Administra
tion, and leady to denounce thi-*, ns legitimate offspring, the
most pernicious of therr all
His adminií-tiation consisted of a succession of astaundmg
measuies which fell on thft publn eai ¡ike lepeated bursts of
loud and appalling thunder Befoie the reveiDerations of one
peal had ceased, another and another came, louder and louder,
and moie terrifying Oi rather, it was like a volcanic mountain,
emitting frightful eruptions of burning lava Befoie one was
cold and crusted, before the voices of the inhabitants of buned
villages nd cities were hu>h> d in eternal «uleiice, anothei, more
desolating, was vomited forth extending wider and wider the
circle of death and destruction
Mr President, this is no unnecessary disne^jon The per
sonal character of such a chief as I have been describing, his
pasbions, hispiopensities the character of hi1* mind, should be
all thoroughly studied, to comprehend clearly his measuies and
hisadmimstiation But I will now proceed to moreduect and
strict proofs of my second and third propositions That he was
reserved to break down the Bmk of the United States, is
proven by the same citations from his messages which I have
made, to exhibit luspmpo e to estab'ish a Tieasiny bank, is
proven by his veto message, and by the fact that he did destroy
it The war against ail other banks was not originally an
nounced, becaube lie wished ÜV State banks to be auxihanes m
overthrowing the Bank of the United states, and because such
an annunciatior would have been too resh and shocking upon
the people of the United btateb foi even his tremendous influ*

foie President Jackson seriously entered upon hisneweareei
of hostility to the State banks At the commencement of the
session of Congress in 1834, he imagined a sufficient calm had
been produced, and, m his annual message of that year, the
war upon the State banks was opened In that message he
bays
" It seems due to the safety of the public funds remaining in
that bank, and to the honor of the American people, that mea-

favorable condition oí the country, we cnunt (ake an effectual
s'and against this sj xtxt of moiopolj- and pracacaily prove,
in respect to the cunency, as wtlias other important interests,
that there is no necessity for so extensive a resort to it as that
which has been heretofore practised "
* * ''It has bcen^een that without the agen
cy of a great moneyed menopoly tne revenue can he collected,
and conveniently and safely applied to all the purposes of the
public expenditure It is also ascertained that, instead of be.-
ing necessarily made to promote the evils of an unchecked pa-
per system, the management of the rev«rme can be marfeauxi
liary to the reform which the Legislatures of the different States
have already commenced in regard to the suppression of small
bills; and which has only to be fostered by 'proper regulations
on the part of Congress, to secure a practical return, to the ex-
tent required for the security of the currency, to the constitu-
tional medium."
As m the instance of the atta«k upon the Bank of the United
States, the approach to the State banks is slew, cautious, and
insidious He reminds Congress and the country that all cal-
culations of temporary convenience must be set aside; that we
must recur to first principles, and that we must see what it is
that has prevented the legislation of Congress and the ¿States
on the subject of the currency from satisfying public expecta
tion He declares his conviction that the want of success has
proceeded from the undue countenance which has been afford
ed to the spirit of monopoly All the serious dangers which
our system has yet encountered may be traced to the resort to
implied powers, and to the use of corporations We have
felt, he says, but one class of these dangers m the contest with
the Bank of the United States, and he clearly intimates that the
othei class is the State banks We are now to see, he proceeds,
whether m the present favorable condition of the country, v e
cannot take an effectual stand against the sp.rit ofmonopov.
Reverting to his favorite scheme of aGoveinaienthank, he sajs
it is asceítained that, instead of being made necessary to pro-
mote the evils of an unchecked paper system^ the manage'
■merit of the revenue can be made auxiliary to the reform w hich
he is desirous to introduce The designs of President Jackson
against the State banks are more fuhy developed and enlarged
upon in his annual message of 1836, from which I heg leave to
quote the following passages
"I beg leave to call your attention to another subject inti-
mately associately with the preceding one—the currency of
the country
"It is apparent, from the whole context of the Constitution,
as well as the history of the times that gave birth to it, that it
was the purpose of the convention to establish a currency con-
sisting of the precious metals These^from theirpeculiar pro-
perties, which rendered them the standard of value m all other
countries, were adopted in this, as well to establish Us commei
cnl standard, m reference to foreign countnes, by a permanent
rule, as to exclude the l°c of a mutable medium of exchange
such as of certain agricultural commodities, recognised by the
statue ot ^omeSta'ts asatendei tor debts, or the sail moie
permeioub expedient of a] ip^i cuirency "
" Vauableness mustev* i 5 <- tn* cnaracteristic of a currency
of which the precious me t = &>p not the chiel ingredient, or
which can be expanded oi e mtrarted without regard to tne
principles that resulate the v ame of those metals as a standard

that tha receipts arising from the ea^s of public lanas weie ip-
