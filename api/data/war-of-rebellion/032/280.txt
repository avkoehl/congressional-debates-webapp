SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General VANDEVER, Fredericktown:

Will move toward you in the morning. Gunboats will reach you, from Cairo, to-night. Be ready, with your cavalry and light artillery, haversacks filled, to fight or pursue, as occasion may offer. My chief of artillery says you can, with your troops and guns, resist 15,000. Instruct your gunners always to try to hit enemy's guns cool and steady.

General, the God of battles be writ you.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

(Same to General McNeil, Cape Girardeau.)

SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 25, 1863.

General VANDEVER, Fredericktown:

General McNeil expect to be attacked at daylight to-morrow on both Jackson and Bloomfield roads, by two columns. I am sending him troops by water. If you can cut your way into Girardeau, to help, I think it would be well.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 25, 1863.

General VANDEVER:

I would not, under the last information you have, leave Pilot Knob, for I have reports just in from McNeil. He says the enemy is moving on him from the southwest, 4,000 strong, and have driven in his outposts on the Frederickstown road and on the White Water.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO.,

April 25, 1863-9 a. m.

General VANDEVER, Pilot Knob, Mo.:

Have you moved against the enemy? Official report from a reconnaissance sent by boat to the Cape shows the enemy at three points on the river: Neeley's Landing, 20 miles above the Cape; at Saint Mary's and near Saint Genevieve. The idea seems to be that they want to seize boats for their stores, while they get off the lead at Fredericktown. It is left to your judgment whether you had better move on them with your cavalry and artillery, via Fredericktown.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., April 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General VANDEVER, Commanding:

From what you can learn below, do you suspect the existence of co-operation in this city with Marmaduke by a plan to rise here coincident with his approach? I have warning of such, and have taken precaution.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.
