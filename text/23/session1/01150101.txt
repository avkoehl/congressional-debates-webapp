ORDERS OF THE DAY
The resol uion of Mr  ROBBÍNS, renprocat
mo- on   the  part of Congress an  exchange of
copies of proceedings, olc , with the British Parlia-
ment and the Fiench Chambers, was taken up,
and adopted
The resol «ion of Mr  Clay of yesterday—
" Tnat the Com mtcee on Finance be directed to
inquire into the expediency of affording tempoiary
relief to  the community from  the present pecu-
niary embarrassments, by prolonging the payment
of revenue  bonds as they fall  Sue, the obligors
paying interest, and giving satisfactory security,"
being under consideta ion-
Mr  CLAY observed that the resolution just
read sufficiently explained its ob|ect—it proposed
to instruct the Committee on Finance to inquire
what relief can be afforded to the community by
delaying the co lection of revenue bonds    He
was not sure tnat the object desired to be accom-
plished could be attained, he was notsu-e tr-it the
state of the Treasury was not such as to require,
for the unavoidable calls of the Government upon
it, the immediate possession of all Us means     If
we were to )jdge of that Depar ment of the Gov
ernment by the situation of one of the other De-
paitments—he meant the Post Offi"e—it was cer
tain we could not do what the resolution contem-
p'ated, because the Government will want all its
available means     But the subject was worthy of
inquiry, and he hoped it might appeal that the
Tieasury could do something—could giant some
re'ief by delaying the collection 01 the revenue
bonds     As regaided the distress existing in the
community that was what no ore could deny
What was the situation of the country four months
ago?   Then, every interest, every branch of trade
was flourishing    In the section of country from
which he came every production of agncal ure i
and manufactures was n demand, the most unex
ampled prosperity pfevai'ed, and what was true
of that section was equally t ue as respecte 1 oth r
parts of the Union   the same unexampled pros
peri'y o'cai'ed     What was the condition of the
countiynow? What blanch of industry vas there
that had not received a most serious fall ?    In one
week, as h«  had been credibly i ifoined, the great
staple commodity of the Sta*e of Pennsylvania
had been reduced from 1'5 cents to 90 cents per
bushel   an extraordinary depression in the south
ern staple had also taken place     Everj thing was
falling and going down, and  it would continue
unless something was dore   Ihei inWiate caj"
of all this distress was now unier discussion in
the Senate, he did not mean to take it up  but if
the deposites should be restored relief ciuld not
be produced by it immediately    When the public
credit is destroyed, and corfidenre shaken, it le
quires a long tine to restore it     But if it should
take place, and if it should be found practicable to
do what is proposed, something would have been
done to restore our foimer prosperity, and at «some
future day he hoped to see a peimanent r°s ora-
tion of it     By adopting the resolution and the
purpose it contemplated relief wou'J beafoided
to some classes of thecommum v    The presume
was ocasioned by the want of money for the pur-
chase of the produce in market    The resolution
proposed an l iquirv, and he hoped the Committee
on Finance w ml 1 find that the Government were
able to s ve some íehef
Mr BliOVfN was opposed to the resolution,
because it was entnely inexpedient for Congress
to hold out to the community the idea of re'ief u i
less they intend that relief to be permanent B it
he was oppo ed to it on another ground It was
thepractice, whentheGovernmentgianted íehef to
those who weie indebted to them, for their debt-
ors to look for farther relief It w as tiue there might I
be distress m tne community, bu' he did not be
heve that it existed to the extent which had been I
represented, he believed it had been greatly exag
gerated   A great depression in tne southern staple,
cotton, had been spoken of, but he would ask, .
tould this measure have reduced the mice of cotton I
in England and in Europe?   The general price of i
cotton anu of tobacco wa  higher here now than it
was this time last year    But the cause to which l
it has been referred is intimately connected with
the true cause, and he would remark, that if an in
stitution is capable of exerting a power such as is
given to the Bank of the United States for such
purposes, jt is time for the people to pause     If a
remedy for the distress be necessaiy, it should be
the removal of that power which is canableof ex
ercising such deleterious influence     lie had been '
told that the maikets and produce of the coun'ry,
and the diminution in the puce of cotton, were to
be attributed to the íemoval of the deposites, and
if any other great phenomenon should happen, no
doubt that, too, would be ascnbed to the same
cause   This excitement got up on this iloo- might
have its poll  cal effects   he di 1 not attubu e po
litical eiFec* as the design of gentlemen—fu, very
far, from it but he was opposed to the íesolution
of inqui-y, because it wa   er' rely mexped ent
Mr FORSYTH hadpoob) ction to the resol-
ution, or to an inquiry, oi to legislative aid, if any
were necessary, but he proposed to amend the íes-
olution—to strike out all after the word " resolv-
ed," and insert the following
"That the Committee on Finance inquire into
' the ext°nt and causes of the alleged distress of
' the community, and into the propi ety of legis
' lativé interference to relieve them "
Mi CL \Y observed, that as compromises had
become fashionable, he would be willing to accept
it, not as a subsMtute, but as an addition to his
resolution He did not know of any other mode
of giving consutuuonal relief, e\cspt that contem
pla ed
Mr SHEPLEi intended to rote against both
the amendment and the resolution We live in an
mte'hgent commun ty, and among a people who
know what their dist. esses are, and what relief is
necessary They have asked no interference on
the part of Congiess, nor petitioned for relief, and
they were as compe ent to say what relief they le
quired as merchants were He should wait ti'l we
were asked to legislate on the peti ions of the peo-
ple Much had been said of the distress of the
people, but he thought there was more in imagin
a'ion than in realitj—a distress which did not
make itself known, except in chaml ers of com
merce and 11 bankn g institutions But so far as
his own St-te was concerned, he could say that

Butif thevhad been indeb ed to the Goveri m nt,
a most mere less credi or, the oebt must hive be n

templated by the íesolution
Mr PRESTO"f wou'd stvo a «mode fact He
had lust leceived a letter fiom a gentleman in
South Caiolma, a large plantes and for many
yea's a director in the Bank of Colombia lie
states that the effect of the recent public measuies
1 is, to hate brought cftnvn the price of cotton so
low, as to be within three to (i.e cents of what the
prices at Liverpool would authorize, and in fact,
ihat such is the pressure that it is impossible to
furnish such facilities to the plantel as are neces-
sary to carry on the business, and no money can be
got from any quarter to pay for the cotton which
is brought theie The gentleman from Maine
says that the c lesof distiess aieonly fiom cham-
beis of commerce and banking houses And what
are chambers of commerce ? Do they not repre-
sent the vast commercial mteiests of the country'
And what are banking houses ? Do they not reg-
ulate and íepresent the whole fiscal affairs of the.
nation? And are they under the influence of this
institution, which it is so desirable to look into >
But, if so, we ought to look further^—we ought to
look to that power which has seized on the bank
and disorganized the country He spoke with
some knowledge of his own part of the countiy
He knew that the staple there had fallen greatly
and suddenly A great many people had em-
barked in the business, and they did not believe it
possible that the Executive could so inteifereas to
reduce their property from twenty five to thirty per
cent There was another matter South Carol,na
held more of the stock of the Uri ed States Bank,
in proportion to her means, than any other State—
it amounted to about five millions, and by one fell
s loop of the Executive, one million of this sum
was lost—the people of the South were losing
daily from three to five cents per pound upon their
gieat staple article, not positively, but relatively,
to the price in the Liverpool maiket The ex-
change was struck down and money was not to be
had to purchase anything He heartily desired
that if it was in the power of Congress, as general
a relief in ght be granted as was piacticable
Mr rORSYTH had no objection to the amend-
ment, either as a substitute or an addition There
was nothing unfan in the resolution, but it was
not necessary His general inquiry included the
gen'leman's [Mr Clay's] particular inquiry All
he seemed to desire was that the specific mode of
relief might be under the inquiry of the commit-
tee He (Mr F ) had no objection that the Corn-
il mittee on Finance should take the general welfare
into cons deration, and he had no wish but that
I u constitutional remedy should be aophed He
believed that distiess did exist in the community.
It had been alleged that the distress was very
great This he believed was incorrect, he thought
it greatly exaggerated For we had been just told
by°a distinguished gentleman, lately one of the
¿rectors of the Un ted States Bank, that the mere
removal of the deposites did not and could not
have produced the distress Whence, tnen, doea
it arise' Fiom the conflict, the war which the
institution is waging to get back the deposites
The deposites having been removed, it stands still
to see what may follow, and it stands still, too,
that us power may be felt in every nerve and fibre
of the community—that every man shall feel the
nccessi'y of the institution As to the wisdom or
policy of this course of conduct, he would leave
tha to tne gentleman to settle The relief con-
tennlated, he thought, could at best only benefi
the importers
M" CLAY asked if the gentleman did not see
th-t if the inqiiry proposed by himse'f were
adopted, Mi F 's would not be excluded? Had
the gentleman suggested any other mode of relief
thai tnat? In regard to relieving the importer 
only, v hat is if, he would ask,that the Executive
has done ? What has the Secretary of the Treas-
uiy in 1 is late edict said? Give r lief to the im-
poite-s And what did his resolution ask "but an
inqui > with a view to relieving the same c'ass'
II  should vote asramst the amerdment
Mr SPRAGJE <iaid,aa it had been argued
th t the distress produced was not the effect of the
re noval of tne deposites, it was not of much mo-
mei t whf t reso'ution v as adopted
[Mr FORSV TH observed that the gentleman
al' ,ded to m his speech had said that the mere re-
movil of the deposites could not have produced
the piesent di tre^s ]
If so, then the answer does not meet the ques-
tion It was tne manner of the removal, and the
 ent'°m"n in his speech attributed the distress to
t e e^ ecution of the  ct That the way in which
it was done impelled the bank to a course of seIf
detence    The issuing of contingent checks, to be
