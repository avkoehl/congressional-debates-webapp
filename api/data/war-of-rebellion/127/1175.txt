to make it an object. The small-arms and accouterments can readily be made serviceable, whilst the cannon are in good order, and the carriages, harness, &amp;c., mostly in a condition to be rendered available. Besides these some mustard and medicine was bought, the whole of which Mr. Lafitte intends shipping by a schooner, this mode of conveyance being justified by the low prices at which the various articles were bought. We paid for the six cannon $125 each; for the small-arms $1. 50 to $3 each; accouterments $1. 50 to $3. 50 per box, &c. If you should desire to take this shipment for account of the War Department please advise Messrs. John Fraser & Co. on receipt of this. Otherwise the venture will go forward at Mr. Lafitte's risk.

A Mr. Hart, who acts here for S. Isaac, Campbell & Co., of London, has applied to me to know whether the Government would feel disposed to purchase certain shipments by the steamer Columbia, now daily expected, and the steamer Sylph, due in about three weeks. The former has two batteries of eight guns each complete, and the latter a similar cargo. It appears that these guns are from the Vienna Arsenal, and were approved of by Captain Huse. The London parties made a contract to deliver them into the Confederacy at a certain price, but are now apprehensive of the danger of running the blockade, and would sell them here at a proportionately low figure. You may well imagine I did not hold out the slightest encouragement that a proposition which strips their agreement of almost every risk would be entertained, but at the solicitation of Mr. Hart I submit the matter to your consideration. The Oreto still remains under seizure, but the proceedings instituted for her release are now complete and will be pushed forward vigorously. Our complaint was filed in court this morning, and the libel may be put in to-day or on the 30th. On the 1st of July our counsel will argue on the law points, and his opinion is that the case will be thrown out before going to trial. There is no doubt that we shall gain the case, but hints have been thrown out that the captain of the Greyhound will appeal from the decision to the admiralty court in England. This would result in serious delay, but I am of the opinion that he will hesitate to involve himself in a proceeding which, if adversely decided, must entail on him most serious injury, both professional and pecuniary.

The Thos. L. Wragg, which sailed hence on the 20th, was compelled to return yesterday to Turtle Bay, about forty-six miles from here, short of coal. She was discovered making for Charleston Harbor and chased back by three steamers for twenty-four hours. The requisite coal will be dispatched this afternoon, and she will try it again on the 1st of July, I hope with better success. I have transmitted by this opportunity to the State Department copies of three communications from Lord Lyons to the Governor of these islands in relation to the capture of the steamers Bermuda and Ella Warley. I have shipped by the steamer Herald the following goods ex Melita:
