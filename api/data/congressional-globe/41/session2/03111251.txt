Whereas the tenth article of the Cherokee treaty

! COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION.

the part of the Senate shall hereafter be known
and designated as tho Committee on Education and
Labor.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent.
Mr. HOWARD. I should like to bear some
explanation of that.
Mr. CRAGIN. I will say that the committee
in the House is so designated. It has often
| occurred, since I have been in the Senate, that
| there has been great doubt to what committee
I petitions and other matters on the subject of
labor should be referred. Such matters have
often been referred to the Committee on Naval
: Affairs, but we did not quite understand how
j they should go there; and as petitions and
! memorials are coming into the Senate, and are
| likely to come in, on this subject of labor, and
j as the Committee on Education have very little
i to do, taking the precedent of the House, I
thought it very appropriate that this change
should be made.
The resolution was agreed to.
DISTRICT COURT IN VIRGINIA.
Mr. JOHNSTON submitted the following
j resolution; which was considered by unanimous

Whereas tho judge of the district court for the dis-

Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary
inquire whether any amendment of the law or any
legislation is necessary in regard to said terms of the
said court.
JOINT INDIAN COMMITTEE.
Mr. HARLAN. I move that the Senate
take up for consideration the concurrent reso-
lution of the House of Representatives in rela-
tion to raising a joint committee to consider
matters pertaining to Indian affairs.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the following concurrent
resolution, adopted by the House of Repre-
sentatives on the 15th of March, 1869 :
Resolved by the House of Representatives, (the Sen-
ate concurring,) That a joint special Committee on
Indian Affairs, consisting of nine members, three
from the Senate and six from tho House, be ap-
pointed, to whom shall be referred all matters relat-
ing to treaties with Indian tribes, payment of annu-
ities and examination of claims referred to Congress
from the Interior Department relating to Indians,
with power to consider all questions arising under
said treaties, andwhetherthesamemaybe abrogated,
annulled, or modified; and whether any further
treaties shall be made with Indian tribes, and if any,
under what restriction; and whether any and what
revision of the several acts providing for the organ-
ization of the department of Indian affairs may bo
expedient or necessary; and also whether any and
what further provision may be necessary for auditing
accounts, examining vouchers presented in relation
to feeding and caring for tho Indians, and in what
manner and to what extent they shall be subsisted,
and what lands shall be reserved and set apart for
them, aud how the same may be secured by law to
the use of the Indian tribes; and finally to consider
the expediency of determining by law what shall be
the legal status of persons of Indian descent under
the laws of the United States, and what course shall
be taken toward them which shall best tend to their
civilization, Christianization, and ultimato citizen-
ship; and to report thereQn by bill or otherwise.
Said committee shall have power to employ a clerk
and examine witnesses, if necessary.
