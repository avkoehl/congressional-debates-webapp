beany relief to him, or would 1'remove the Secre
tary'd responsibility ' The P esident was not
authorized, under our Cons'ituuon and laws, to
take oiF the responsibility of ary officer of the
Govein mentón whom Congress has imposed such
responsibility He would suppose a case Sup-
pose an officer of the Govei nment to violate a law,
by order of the Piesident will his responsibility
be removed' Cei a nly not There were onlyÉ
two modes by which the responsibility could be
taken off One was by the power of an aimed
force The other, wheie a man says a thing and
it is believed where he does it, and is applauded,
be the act what it may Populnn'y may justify
assuming the responsibility, but it is a mostoanger
ous experiment Mr S said that the whole result
in his mind was, that if there was a single power
which could relieve any officer of h's whole íesron-
sibility, it was an unmitigated despotism What,
he would inquire, is a despotism, but that one man
should say to another, you are to act onjny respon-
sibility' Could the Autocrat of the Russias, could
the Sul'an of Tuikey, do moie' If one man can
take upon himself the whole responsibility of every
agent of Government, it is a revolution alreadv,
which, although bloodless, yet, in the emphatic
language of the gentleman from Kentucky, may not
continue so when the people, m their throes, shall
begin to feel the chains riveted upon them He
had always thought the Constitution of the United
States exp-essly designed to keep the Executive
apart from the Treasury of the nation At the
time of the formation of that instrument the subject
engaged the attention of some of the most enlight-
ened men of our country, and the cry of eveiy
patnot was to keep them far asundei, and accord-
ingly the Treasury Depaitment was established
for the purpose of preventing the Executive from
having the control of the money of the ration
Mr S here read at length from the laws of the
United States the manner in which money was to
be drawn from the Treasury, tl at the Tieasurei
was to give bond, and asked why was tneTreas-
urar to give bond if the Secietary was authorized
to draw the money, put it wheie he pleased, and
select his own agents' Why was not the Secie-
tary himself required to give bond' Tnere is not
aman in the Government, a disbursing officer,who
is not oohged to give bond, and why is it that the
Treasurer is to give it, and not the Secretary him
self There is but one so'ut on to the question—-
that he alone is the officr appom'ed to receive
and keep the moneys of the United States Before
Congress had prov ded the place for keeping the
public money theTieasurei was obliged to keep
it safely But when a place was provided by Con
giess for its reception, the Tieasuiei was not held
responsible, but the guaidians of thatplace, it was
only when no place was provided foi it that the
Tieasuier was bound to keep it ltwasthe olject
of Congress to remove the Treasury as far as pos-
sible from the Executive, oi o'heiwise Congi°ss
would not have requued the S cre iry to makehis
communications to Congress only If it had been
otherwise, why was ne not lequired to make his
repoi s to the President,! ke the Seei°taiy of War
and Navy J- But it is said that all this i easoning is
of no validity, because the President retains the
powei of dismission, and, theiefore, tne inference
is, that this power of dismission is to give to the
Piesident the entire control ovei our who'e polit-
ical system Is this, can this be true' Hedidnot
deny the power of dismission That was a ques-
tion which had been agita'ed and set led at a very
earl} day, but then it was nntdesigned to beexei-
cised is it now has been The celebrated Eibnd0e
Gerry, a prophet, and more than a piophet, foie-
saw the result of an abuse of this power, for he
fixed the period at the year 1829 At his day
there was not a man in Corgi eus of the Un ted
States that ever dieamed 'hat that power could oi
would be exercised for party puiposes, oi foi ena
blmg the Executive to obtam the control over the
Tieasury of the Union They went no fuither
than to admit that it might be done It was a
power that was to be exeictsed under the control
of the laws, and it has always been so exercised,
until very lately Where theie is a powei and a
duty to be exercised agi ecably to law, and there is
a m ntal or othei physical incapacity to exercise
the duty, Mr S admitted that there was a power
reposed m th° Executive to see that the act enjoined
should be either done or forbidden, as required
by law, but then only until the legislative action
could be brought to con'rol both tne act and the
cause of the act Cou'd the Pipsident urdertake
to say how a man should perfoim his duty under
the laws ' The legislat ve powei has dnected its
agent to perform a certain act accoiding to his dis
cietion How, then, can he do so, if the President
can interpose' and if he can, how is there anything,
either of judicial or legislative power, left' There
is none, the President possess the whole judicial
power of the country If it be so, he can direct
the marshal to bung before your courts all and ary
person, at his pleasure or his enmity, and where,
then, is your trial by jury, that sacred guarantied
right, which is the lite and soul of this country '
lie would ask, then, if Senators were prepaied to
sanction such powers' Ifthey veie, they were pie-
pared to be slaves He was not prepared to say
the Pres dent would abuse his power But if he
did not, who cou'd know who his successor, or the
successois of his successor, might ne' Pie (Mi
S ) would not tiust any man on earth with such a
power The conclusion of his mind, then, was,
and he had come to it on anxious reflection, that
it was a high abuse of power in the Executive to
disolace an officer because he would not execute
his duties by the Executivestandard He regarded
the dismissal of Mr Duane, not as a triumph
over the Secietai > oi the bank, but over the people
and over the law of the land But to return to
the preexisting pow er If the Treasurer is to le
ceive and keep the money, does it not follow that
he shall select the place where it shall, on lnsown
respotisibil lJ; be safely kept' But suppose we
should admit the powei claimed by the Secietary
What is his leasonin^ upon it' He says it was
leseived in the sixteen h section of the bank chat-
tel but if it is to he found nowhere else, it is a
useless provision, for it will not bear him out in
his position
Mi   S  having again argued at'eng'h upon the
contract entered into between the Government ard
the bank by thecharter, and also upon the geneial
nature and [ ropei and legal constiuction of con
tracts, s„id tl is contiact was a voluntary act or
offer on the piit of the Government, the formation
of it was not called for by the bank or the individ-
uals who were to be concerned m n     It was not,
however, uncalled for by the Government, for the
Government was foiced by the necessities of the
nation to oiler the charter, and  it p^escubed the
terms of its own accord— tm¡ de a voluntary ofler
to the people, which, having been embraced, tne
contract tS sealed, and the nation would disiegaid
its own honoi if it si ould now stand by and see it
violated by the officers of the Government     At
the tune the Govemment made this offer the evils
of the countiy weie great, and  it was wished to
create a fiscal sgent for its own use     It, therefore,
preset ibecl the terns on w hich it should act    True,
it might have left this to the State banks, but  it
had passed an act on the 15 h of January, 1815,
which created such an agent, the Piesid nt, how-
ever, vetoed the bill, but, let it be remembered, not
on constitutional giounds     But at the next ses
sion Congiess saw the immense difficulties upon
the coun'iy  which they were compelled to cut
through, ard being on the eve of chai terms the
present bank, they required of it the performance
of certain teims, the payment of specie, the resto
íation of tne currency  to art as the fiscal agent of
the Government to keep safely tne public money,
and  tiansfe- it to any place wheie it mignt be I
requ red, without any expense to theGoveinment
On the other hand, Coi gresshad given it an actof .
mcoipoiation, had  subsc ihed seven millions to I
its slock, had m tde it i s fiscal agent, and held
out mvitatiors to 'he people to subscribe the re
mimder of the stock     All this was the act of
Congress, and it was dishonoral le now to violate
acortiact which was the resu't of itsown piopcsi
tion   It was nota question of this man oi that man
at that day     The b\nk was required to peí foi m
certa n duties, and if it fa led to do them the char
te- piescnbed a remedy     But when it had ) er
formed all the duties requi ed of it, it had a light
to piofi  for themselves— o heat) up as much as it
could for the stockholders     Wl at was the sub
scnption of Congiess to tl e stock'   Was it more
that a subscupuon of the people, whose interest in
the bank the Government directors wereappointed
to superintend and watch over' Sir, these direct-
ors were not sent to act as spies and informers
upon 'he bank, but to represent one of the parties
m the concern By the acceptance of the terns
by the people, whi"h weie dictated by the Govern-
ment, it had no light to travel out ot its terms and
require others Mi S was no friend to the bank;
was not a stockholder, and never had been, he did
not know ten of its directois, and had en]oyed as
little of its benefits as any other man, but it had
peifoimed the terms required of it The Secretary
admits that the deposites are safe, the bank did
restore the currency of the country, and in doing
so passed millions into the Tieasuiy which would
otherwise have been lost From a depreciation of
twelve or fifteen per cent it had raised the paper
money then in the hands of the Government to
par, by which it was enabled to pay nine millions
of the national debt years sooner than it would
have been paid Everything which had been ob-
tained by the Government through the Bank of
Columbia (and it had not lost a single cent) had
been saved by the branch here, at a loss to the
bianch of at least $150 000 And yet the Secie-
tary says that although the bank may have per-
formed all the terms oí its stipulation,'he may
violate the teims oftered by the Govei nment, and
remove the deposites No matter what aie his
reasons or motives—no matter how vile they may
be, he contends that he is the agent of the Govern-
ment, and can remove them whenever he thinks
fit If this could be, Mi S thought it proved a
deep and degraded otate of both public and private
molality. But he says, further, that he may do it
whenever,in Ins judgment, the puplic interest and
convenience in any degree require it—the slightest
notions of convenience are to justify him in tramp
ling down a contract which the pledged honor of
the Government requued him to uphold Con-
venience was a stale apology, which usurpers
could readily grasp hold of for the assumption of
power Did Congress, when t adopted that sec-
tion in the bank charter on which this assumed
power is founded, behe\e that it was conferring
such a powei ' Did the honorable Senator ftom
Massachusetts now hei , but then a member of
tne House of Representatives, who penned that
section, understand at the time that it was con-
ferí mg such a power'
Mr WEBSTER    No, no, no
Mr S then continued, by reading at length an
extract from an opinion given by Mr Taney when
Attorney General of the United States, foi the
purpose of showing that he held opinions on the
doctrine of poweis and delegated trusts dtffeient
from those on which he acted m the removal of
the deposites Mr S then went into an examin-
ation of the opinions imputed to Mr Crawford
by the Secretary of the Treasury, m relation to
the removal of the Government deposites He
read the resolution of Congress from Story, thi-d
volume, page 161b, upon which he contended that
M>" Crawford's correspondence was founded, and
that it proceeded from the anxiety of Congiess to
i estore specie payments 1 eiore tne Bank of the
United States went into oneration, and to with-
hold the laige amount of Government funds m
State bank papei from the United States Bank, to
protect them fiom that bank Mr S had just
concluded his aigument on that point, when he
yielded the flooi to Mi SPRAGUE, on whose
motion the Senate adjourned
