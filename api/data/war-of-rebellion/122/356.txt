This acceptance is with the distinct understanding that this Department will revoke the commissions of all officers who may be found incompetent for the proper discharge of their duties. Adjutant-General Thomas, at Washington, must be promptly advised of the date at which the men will be ready for mustering, and he will detail an officer for that purpose.
