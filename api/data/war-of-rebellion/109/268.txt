Sunday last. Infantry and artillery had been leaving by Mobile road for a week previous. General Prie in command of troops left at Tupelo. This corroborates reports a day ro two since. Small force of cavalry at Moulton last Friday. No force at Russellville. Guerrilla parties reported in the hills to the south of Town Creek bridge. The Forty- second Illinois, at Courtland, well fortified and have a strong position. Colonel Harrington, commanding First Brigade, went west along the line yesterday. W	hen he returns I will be able to report you fully of the condition of things at the several stations on that portion of our line.

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Mississippi:

Nothing of importance to communicate to- day. The railroad completed and train run through to Decatur. I have ordered the troops of my division stationed at Bear Creek bridge and west of that point when relieved as follows: The Twenty- seventh and Beebe's battery to oproceed to this place; the four companies of the Twenty- second Illinois one company at Buzzard Roost, one at Cherokee, one at Cane Creek bridge, making three companies at each of these stations, and one company at Little Bear Creek, relieving a company of the Tenth Michigan, who will be ordered to Tuscumbia as an additional company to the provost guard. It may be well to send the Twenty- seventh Regiment and Beebe's battery to Courtland. The health of the troops is improving rapidly and some few absentees coming up.

Brigadier-General, Commanding First Division.
