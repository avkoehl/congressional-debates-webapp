HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, May 18, 1865-7 p. m.

(Received 10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

General Weitzel is directed to reduce his wagons one-half and the mules he takes three-fourths, with the expectation of gathering in Texas the additional animals he may want. I think the reduction of animals might bestill greater. All he would want at first will be mules enough to secure about four good teams to 1,000 men. The white men connected with batteries may be detached and sent here for muster out, or detained if you have use for them. One guns to 1,000 men will be sufficient for Weitzel to take with him.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, May 18, 1865.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

Your very kind dispatch placing your house at Mrs. Grant's disposal during her stay is received. I have not seen Mrs. Grant since, but known she will be delighted to get out of the hotel for the few weeks she remains here.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., May 18, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Armies, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: The Potomac at the Aqueduct Bridge, Georgetown, is narrow, and if the armies, after passing in review, are to return to the south bank of the Potomac, I advise that, to prevent all possibility of accident to the Aqueduct Bridge, a pontoon bridge be laid to Mason's Island from the docks of Georgetown, and that they return by this route. It is impossible to know the precise condition of every stick of timber in the Aqueduct Bridge, which is old and has frequently been repaired. Its main timbers are concealed by sheathing.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General and Brevet Major-General.
