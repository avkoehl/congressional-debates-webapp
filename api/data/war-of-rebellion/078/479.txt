CITY POINT, VA., September 26,1 864-6. 30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Jeff. Davis was in Richmond on last Thursday. This, I think, is beyond a doubt. I have evidence that General Sheridan's victory has created the greatest consternation and alarm for the safety of the city. I will give them another shake before the end of the week.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 26, 1864-10 p. m.

(Received 3. 15 a. m. 27th.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, City Point:

GENERAL: I have your dispatch of to-day. I have already sent one DIVISION (General Newton's) to Chattanooga, and another (Corse's) to Rome. Our armies are much reduced, and if I send back much more I will not be able to threaten Georgia much. There are men enough to the rear to whip Forrest, but they are necessarily scattered to defend the road. Can't you expedite the sending to Nashville of the recruits that are in Indiana and Ohio? They could occupy the forts. Hood is now on the WEST Point road, twenty-four miles south of this, and draws his supplies by that road. Jeff. Davis is there to- day, and superhuman efforts will be made to break my road. Forrest is now lieutenant-general and commands all the enemy's cavalry.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

(Received 2. 30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

General Newton has started for Key WEST and will go, via New Orleans, to see General Canby, and explain much that cannot as well by done by letter. I would like to know by telegraph when Captain Audenried reaches Washington with my dispatches, that I may know that you and General Grant are in possession of my views. I want the recruits sent forward as fast as possible. I know my line of communication will be attacked. Forrest is now lieutenant-general and in command of all the cavalry.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, GA., September 26, 1864.

(Received 2. 50 a. m. 27th.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I have re-enforced my line back as far as Chattanooga; but in Middle Tennessee we are weak, on account of the number of regiments out of time. I would like to have any regiments in Indiana or Ohio sent to Nashville, or recruits would do. Jeff. Davis is on a visit to Hood at Palmetto.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
