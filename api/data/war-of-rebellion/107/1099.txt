the pursuing enemy with the bayonet, crossing two walls on either side of Martinsburg pike, reserving its fire the regiment had crossed both walls, when the enemy were driven from their batteries. Colonel Smith, commanding the Third Brigadse, Third Division of this Third Corps, commanded the First Ohio at the battle of Shiloh, and was tendered, by the Governor of Ohoi his regiment-the One hundred and twentyu-sixth Ohio. The general now commanding the corps of Hooker, Sickles, Berry, and, as his near friend, dares to raise the shround of the chivalric Kearny, needs nothing further to convince the brave and intelligent soldiers of this corps that the efforts for preference are unjust over the repulation of brother soldiers, no matte what State or what army may claim them; when they have proved themselves true and faithul to our Union, to our glorious flag (these troops), ought and must be admitted to the position to which by their gallantry they are entitled.

It has just been signaled that Stuart's entire cavalry force is on the other side of the Hazel River, and that he has established pickets opposite to our own. Division commanders will make such a dispositiobn as will prevent a surprise in that quarter. The regiment at the church (Third Division) should place itself in position and be on the alert.
