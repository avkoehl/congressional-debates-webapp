is conditioned and graded by their neighbors. This should not be. All men must unite in an earnest love for and a desire to maintain and preserve the union of the country, an their respect for the civil law of the land should induce them to unite and put down the murder, theft, robbery, arson, and other kindred crimes that under the name of bushwhacking are so prevalent at present. Until all good men, loyal and disloyal, unite against wrong and robbery, theft and murder,a nd by every means in their power seek to put it down, there will be no peace to our distracted country. Bad men will make trouble always in any community.

The general does not know when he will be able to come and see you in Chariton County, but "Tom" shall have the opportunity to visit home soon.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Whole department force, 6,562, Am all right, but troubles with bushwhackers and Indians increase. Need another infantry regiment, which could probably be raised as 100-days' men. Would like to have permit to raise negro battery, officered with negroes to be commissioned by yourself.
