CHANCELLORSVILLE, VA., May 2, 1863-9.30 a.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

The general commanding desires you to instruct General Sedgwick, if an opportunity presents itself with a reasonable expectation of success, to attack the enemy in his front. We have reliable information that all the divisions known to us as having belonged to the army at Fredericksburg, except Ewell's, are in the vicinity. It is impossible for the general to determine here whether it is expedient for him to attack or not. It must be left to his discretion.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.

MAY 2, 1863-9.45 a.m.

General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Left Wing:

General Hooker telegraphs that you are all right. You have but Ewell's division in your front; balance all up there.
