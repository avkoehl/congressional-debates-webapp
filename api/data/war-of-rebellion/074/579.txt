Etowah River at railroad bridge. Here, in accordance with orders received from you, I left one regiment, the Third Iowa Infantry, as guard to the road. On the 8th marched five miles, reaching the main army at Acworth, Ga., and taking position on the left. In passing through Allatoona this day, in accordance with orders received through you, I left the Second Brigade, Colonel George C. Rogers commanding, as guard to the road. On the 10th moved forward to Big Shanty, striking the enemy just beyond the station. Took position as reserve to the corps. On the 11th moved out on a reconnaissance, meeting the enemy one mile from camp; slight skirmishing all day. From this time until the 16th we were advancing our lines slowly, continually driving the enemy. On the 16th we moved forward and threw up a line of works, the enemy disputing every inch of our advance. Our loss this day was 46 killed and wounded. From this time until the 19th heavy rains prevented active movements. On the 19th the enemy evacuated their line and fell back to a position near Kenesaw Mountain. The division advanced at once and took position before them. On the 27th an assault was made on Kenesaw, an official report of which has already been made to you.* It resulted in a loss to this division of 97 killed and wounded.

On the 2nd of July, at 8.30 p. m., the division started for the right of the army, reaching our position about 6 p. m. of the 3d, after heavy skirmishing, and bivouacked on Mrs. Marble's plantation. On the 4th we moved forward, and drove the enemy into his rifle-pits about four miles from the Chattahoochee River, and, after heavy skirmishing, threw up works within 1,000 yards of his line. The enemy here attempted to shell us from our position, but we soon silenced his guns. On the 5th we charged his works and carried them, driving him into his fortifications on the south side of Nickajack Creek, with a loss to us of 6 killed and 48 wounded. An official report of this affair has been forwarded to you.+ On the 6th we threw up works on Nickajack Creek, within 900 yards of the enemy, who had a very strong position, with three redoubts, in our immediate front, mounting fourteen guns. At 6 o'clock on the evening of the 7th the enemy opened their battery, concentrating their fourteen guns on our front, and delivering for one hour a terrific fire, though doing but little damage. Our loss was 1 killed and 3 wounded. The fire was returned with equal vigor, and we succeeded in silencing him. During the night of the 9th the enemy abandoned his position and fell back to the south side of the Chattahoochee River. We immediately occupied their works, and remained within 600 yards of the river, skirmishing with the enemy on the opposite side until the 16th, when we started for the left of the army, encamping that night near Marietta. On the 17th we passed through Marietta, crossed the Chattahoochee at Roswell Factory, and encamped three miles south of the river. On the 18th we moved to and encamped on Peach Tree Creek near Cross Keys. Moved forward on 19th and encamped within two miles of Decatur, Ga. On the 20th moved forward and met the enemy about 12 m. In accordance with orders from Major-General Blair, I took a position on the left of the Fifteenth Army Corps. After some skirmishing I was directed to move forward and occupy a ridge near the enemy's works, which order was executed with a loss in this division of 51 killed and wounded. Just as my
