THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 19,
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I will not ask it to be
read in full. I propose if it be sent to the
Speaker's desk that it shall be considered as
having been read. I do not intend that the
gentleman shall get off on the question of time.
Mr. VV. R. ROBERTS. Mr. Speaker, we
desire that document shall be read to the
House, or shall be ordered to be printed, so
that every member may be put in possession
of the detailed information which it contains.
If the appropriation be proper itself to be made
by this House out of theTreasury, there ought
not to be the slightest objection to spreading
upon our record the items which go to make
up this large expenditure of the public money.
Mr. MAYNARD. W'e only provide for the
actual travel of witnesses under summons from
the committee, actual and necessary travel. I
think that action has been observed through-
out in reference to witnesses.
Mr. CAMPBELL rose.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Garfield] has the floor.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I demand the
previous question.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. The gentleman said that
he would allow me to have that paper, and if
he will, I will send it to the Speaker's desk
and have it read.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. You can do
that if we do not second the demand for the
previous question. I demand the previous
question 011 the passage of the bill.
Mr. LYNCH. You can -have it read on
Thursday, which is devoted to general debate.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I ask the Clerk to read
the document now.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands
the gentleman from Ohio to say that he de-
mands the previous question, and that whether
the House seconds the demand for the question
or not will be taken as an evidence whether
the House wants the paper read or not.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. 1 will not insist 011 its
being read in full if it be considered as having
been nead. That is all I ask of the House.
Mr- VAN TRUMP. Let it go into the
Globe.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. That is all I ask. I
will not detain the House if it be allowed to
go into the Globe as a part of the remarks.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I do not object.
The SPEAKER. In whose remarks is it
to be incorporated?
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Let it be printed in my
remarks if the gentleman will not consent to
have it incorporated in his, and let it go as
coming from the gentleman from Ohio, the
chairman of the Conitnitlee 011 Appropriations.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman has leave
to print his remarks. [Laughter.]
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I did not quite ask that:
but I will not gainsay the Speaker, as my only
object is to get the paper before the House.
The paper is as follows:

edness of the joint select Committee on Alleged Out-
I'ci'jeti in the /Southern States.

The Attorney General placed in tho hands of the
chairman of the joint committee $12,500, out of the
appropriation for the prosecution of crimes, made
by act of March 3,18<1. Of this amount $10,000 has
been applied to the payment of the expenses of the
sub-committees while in Georgia. Florida, Alabama,

$2,500. to be returned to the Department of Justice.
This $10,000, borrowed and expended, is also to be
returned, and is included in the amount of indebt-
edness, as stated. It is not additional thereto.
The Attorney General considered himself war-
ranted in furnishing the committee, under the terms
of the act referred to. with the amount he placed at
their disposal for the purposes of the investigation,
expecting it, however, to be replaced  by a future
appropriation.
