EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, C. SA. A., Richmond, Va., December 19, 1864.

General R. E. LEE, Petersburg:

The following dispatch just received from General B[eauregard]:

SAVANNAH, December 18, 1864.

General Sherman demanded the surrender of Savannah yesterday of General Hardee, which was refused. The city must be evacuated soon as practicable. The loss of Savannah will be followed by that of the railroad from Augusta to Charleston and soon after of Charleston itself. Cannot Hoke's and Johnson's divisions be spared for defense of South Carolina and Georgia until part of or whole of Hood's army could reach Georgia?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

I cannot realize the consequences as portrayed, but General Bragg, who has just returned, if you can have a conference with him, may furnish you facts with which yo can better judge. Let me have your advice, and, if you choose, communicate with General Beauregard.

General R. E. LEE, Commanding, Petersburg:

Your dispatch* of 11.45 last night is received and General Hoke's division is ordered to be ready, as I have no better troops. I cannot suggest any change, unless Wilmington is garrisoned strongly enough to allow us time to try and get at the enemy here. It may be necessary, too, to be more prompt in our movements, to meet those of General Grant, than we have been heretofore.
