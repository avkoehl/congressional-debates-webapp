HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, May 27, 1864-8.45 p. M.

Major-General SHERMAN,Commanding Military Division:

GENERAL: Inclosed I send you a sketch of our position at this time.* We have advanced some little distance, with some pretty live skirmishing. The enemy contest our advance clear round from the north Marietta road to the Villa Rica road, obliging us to front east, northeast, and southeast. The country is very broken and wooded, so that we cannot see any distance in advance, and have to develop the enemy's position cautiously. I have sent orders to General Garrard, now near Pumpkin Vine on the map, to push up to this place if possible, taking the left of the enemy in flank and rear.+

Very respectfully,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, commanding.

Major-General SHERMAN,Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Our skirmishers advanced this morning as soon as it was light enough to see and found only a light of the enemy's skirmishers. These they drove out of the works and have followed them half a mile beyond New Hope Church, and are still pressing on slowly. General Harrow, who is on my left, has infantry skirmishers opposed to him and Morgan L. Smith, on his (Harrow's) right, has struck nothing but cavalry. We have not ascertained yet where the enemy has gone to, and are following cautiuosly. Have captured a lituenant and
