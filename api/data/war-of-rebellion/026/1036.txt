9 a. m. this morning I proceeded to execute the order, and have destroyed two wharves-Cox's and Aiken's. The destroying of landings, as ordered by General Longstreet, I do not understand. To-morrow the working party will proceed to Deep Bottom, Curtis' Neck, Turkey Island, and Ladd's, destroying all the wharves as low down as we can reach. Will you please say by return courier how low down I must go? The order embraces all the wharves on this side of James River. It will require more force than I have under my command to execute it. Shall I proceed as far as I safely may to the mouth of the Chickahominy?

General, permit me to say this is a vain expenditure of labor. The enemy can land any 5 miles as well without as with the wharves. I say this under a sense of duty.

Very respectfully and respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY A. WISE,

Brigadier-General.

Major General D. H. HILL, Commanding, Kinston, N. C.:

GENERAL: Your favor of the 29th ultimo has been received. Two regiments of Clingman's brigade left here yesterday for Wilmington; the other two will probably leave to-day. You have also been telegraphed to that effect. I will also be happy to assist you to the extent of our means, so soon as I shall know positively the departure of the balance of Foster's troops still on Folly Island, near the mount of the Stono, and on Seabrook's Island, North Edisto. The enemy's iron-clads are still as already report-one on Port Royal and five in North Edisto. What he proposes doing with them is more than can now be determined; probably he has not done so himself.

Wishing you ample success in your future operations, I remain, yours, very truly,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
