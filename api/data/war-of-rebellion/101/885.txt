this department and returned to District of Vicksburg is received. These regiments constitute the garrison of the post at Saint Charles. They will be relieved in a few days be troops expected from the vicinity of Fort Smith. The recent forwarding of detachment of the Seventh Army Corps to New Orleans, as also the Thirty-fifth Wisconsin and Ninety-sixth Ohio Regiments to same destination, deprives me of any possible means of reliving the garrison at Saint Charles immediately. Orders for the Twenty-third Wisconsin Regiment to report to the commanding officer of the Reserve Corps have issued.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, &amp;c.,
