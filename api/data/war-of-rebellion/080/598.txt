Colonel Forty-eighth Regiment Pennsylvania Veteran Vol. Infantry.

BEFORE PETERSBURG, VA., July 31, 1864.

No. 213. Report of Colonel Henry G. Thomas, Nineteenth U. S. Colored Troops, commanding Second Brigade, of operations July 30.

HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, FOURTH DIV., NINTH ARMY CORPS, August 2, 1864.

SIR: With regard to the fight of July 30, 1864, I have the honor to state that soon after daylight in the morning this brigade entered the covered way leading to the front of that part of the line occupied by the Ninth Corps, following the First Brigade of our division. We were held about half an hour in this way, and then went at double-quick into the exploded fort and into the rifle-pits on our right.

Here Lieutenant Pennell was killed and riddled through and through. He died with the flag in his hand, doing everything an officer could do to lead on the men. His appearance and actions were splendid-I might say heroic, sacrificing deliberately and knowingly his life in the hope of rendering his country some service. A partially successful attempt was then made to separate the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Regiments U. S. Colored Troops from the white troops of one of the brigades of the First Division, Ninth Corps, previous to attempting another charge. I then sent word that unless the enfilading fire on my right was stopped, by the moving of a force in that direction at the moment in which I moved, that no men could live to reach the crest. Immediately after this I was ordered by Brigadier-General Ferrero to advance in concert with Colonel Sigfried and take the crest. I ordered the Twenty-ninth this time to lead, which it did gallantly, closely followed by the Twenty-eighth and a few of the Twenty-third, when it was at once engaged by a heavy charging column of the enemy, and after a struggle driven
