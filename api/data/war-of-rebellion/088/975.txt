Major Michler, Engineers, who arranged the garrisons for the field-works, is at present absent from camp. I will lay your dispatch before him when he returns and let you know whether there has been any error with regard to the garrison assigned to Fort Morton.

Major General D. B. BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Corps:

Major Michler, acting chief engineers, states that in assigning 800 men as the garrison of Fort Morton, it was designed that this garrison should also occupy Battery Numbers 14, on the right. If the garrison cannot be accommodated in the fort and redoubt, it can be placed in the covered way adjacent.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
