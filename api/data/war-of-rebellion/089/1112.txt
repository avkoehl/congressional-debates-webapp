daylight. With the exception of one officer, a second lieutenant, who has just entered the service and had never before heard an enemy's shot, I believe all the troops concerned behaved well, and thwarted a well-formed plan of the rebels to accomplish very much more that they succeeded in doing. The attack on my front was immediately after the attack on the Third Division front. The conduct of the officer referred to above will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. He is reported to have come to our main line and stated that all the division pickets were capture. He, however, returned to his post immediately after.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that six privates Thirty-fourth Virginia came over last night. They report that they have had no meat ration for two days, and that it is the camp rumor that Fort Fisher and Bald Head Island have fallen into our hands.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

We propose to employed the heading of Duth Gap at 11 a. m. to-morrow. I should be happy to see yourself and friends at headquarters. We must be near the time because of the tide.

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,December 31, 1864.

General TURNER:

The state of the roads is such that [it] is almost impossible to move troops and the weather such as to make them most uncomfortable on arriving in a new camp. I, therefore, suggest that unless there are strong reasons why General Harris' brigade should come from Bermuda to-day that its movement should be postponed.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
