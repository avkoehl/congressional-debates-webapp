HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Milliken's Bend, La., April 2, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Comdg. Department of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: Among the letters found with the mail carrier yesterday is one signed by Sergt. A. Myott, and dated on the 27th ultimo, at Vicksburg, in which the writer says that all the force lately at Vicksburg, except his own regiment, has gone up to Yazoo to meet the Yankees. This, I think, is proximately, but not literally, true. Since then, doubtless, several regiments have returned to Vicksburg.

In the Vicksburg Whig, of the 31st ultimo, an order of the same date is noticed, requiring all persons to bring all skiffs and other craft to Vicksburg and deliver them to the military authorities and obtain payment for the same. I mention this fact because it may import something desirable to be known.

Your obedient servant,JOHN A. McClernand.

Very respectfully,

U. S. GRANT.
