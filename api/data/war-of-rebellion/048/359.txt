by his brigade commander for a daring charge through a column of rebel infantry. Cols. J. Irvin Gregg, Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and J. P. Taylor, First Pennsylvania Cavalry, commanding, respectively, the Second and First Brigades, were in these engagements all that could be asked. Their well-established reputations as brigade commanders are too well known to require other mention.

In these engagements my command was so dispersed that the duties of staff officers were very severe. It is with pleasure that I call the attention of the major-general commanding to the excellent conduct of my own staff and those of my brigade commanders.

Lieutenants Martin and Cutler, of Colonel Gregg's staff, were both severely wounded at Sulphur Springs.

The total loss of the division at Sulphur Springs and on the 14th is as follows: Officers, 3 killed, 13 wounded, and 6 missing; enlisted men, 14 killed, 101 wounded, and 426 missing. Of those reported missing at Sulphur Springs, very many were killed and wounded.

Accompanying is a nominal list of casualties.*

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. MCM. GREGG,

Brigadier General of Vols., Commanding Second Division, Cavalry Corps.

Captain C. C. SUYDAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
