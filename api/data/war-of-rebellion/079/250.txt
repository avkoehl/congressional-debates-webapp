Garrard is pushing on finely, my infantry in close support. He has driven Armstrong's cavalry the last two miles. Captured two pieces of artillery and a number of prisoners. Citizens report a larger force of cavalry (Harrison's DIVISION) ahead. I leave one DIVISION of infantry to cover the roads coming in from Summerville by Texas Valley, and push the other forward.
