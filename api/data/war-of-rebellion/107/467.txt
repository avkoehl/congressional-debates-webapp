troops under my command. The corps consists of five regiments of infantry, Ricketts' battery (six pieces) and the New York Ninth Regiment battery (four pieces) of artillery and Chambliss' troop, Second Cavalry. The main body of the Fifteenth Massachusetts Regiment is posted on the common in Poolesville, having two companies on picket duty near Conrad's Ferry. The main body of the Tammany Regiment is posted one mile from Ppolesville on the road to Conrad's Ferry, having four companies on outpost and picket duty at and above Conrad's Ferry. One wing of the Second Regiment New York State Militia is posted one mile from Poolesville on the road to the Monocacy, while four companies form an outpost at the mouth of the Monocacy and throw pickets up the river to meet those of the Pennsylvania Twenty-eighth, and down the river to meet those from the Tammany. The Minnesota regiment is posted two miles or two miles anda alf from Poolesville on he road to Edwards Ferry, having its outpost at Edwards Ferry and throwing pickets up the river to meet those of the Massachusetts Fifteenth, and down the river to meet those of the Thirty-fourth New York. The Thirty-fourth New York is stationed at Seneca mIlls and throws out pickets up the river to meet those of the Minnesota, and down the river to meet those of General McCall's command at Big Falls. The artillery is posted according to circumstances from time to time, by battery, by section, or by piece, but has its camp on the common at Poolesville. The cavalry is posted near the camp of the Second Regiment New York. The following sketch* will give an idea of the positions.

From the above I hope Major-General Banks will be enabled to gain a sufficiently clear idea of the disposition of my forces in his vicinity. There seems to be no change in the positions of the hostile camps since Wednesday last.

Very respectfully, I am, captain, your most obedient servant,

Numbers 4.]

General W. S. ROSECRANS:

Have received nothing form you since your Numbers 1. I have a party pushing up toward the rebels at Cross-Lanes. I begin to fear they have suspicion of their danger and are getting back across the Gauley. They have ceased giving us a chance in skirmishes and hold their strong points in too great force for the department I can afford to send. This makes it harder to get at them and learn their movements. I expect some information to-night.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
