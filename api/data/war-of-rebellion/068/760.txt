HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-8.40 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS.

The enemy made but little to our regaining Jett's house. The force that attacked Upton came from the south, from the road between Guiney's Station and the Court-House. The country between Jett's house nab this road is mainly open, with a belt of woods intervening. The ground at the house is as high as the Court-House and descends to the southeast. I will send you a sketch. There is no road from here to Jett's for artillery. There can be one got between it and the Anderson House. Jett's place is known as the Bleak Hill. he is a temporary occupant. Troops have been moving to the left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
