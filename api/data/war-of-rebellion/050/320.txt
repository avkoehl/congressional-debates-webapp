battalions were replaced by the Fifteenth U. S. Infantry, I taking the position lately held by it in the second line. Here my command remained, after changing front slightly to the right, until after sunset, after every brigade on my right had retired, when I was ordered to do so.

Over a wide corn-field, under a terrific fire of musketry, canister, and spherical case shot, my men steadily and slowly followed their color, when, gaining the woods, they faced about, fired, and moved to the rear, where, as ordered, I reported to the general of brigade.

I desire to recommend for brevet, for gallant and meritorious conduct, under my own eye on both days, the following officers: Captains Henry Haymond and Anson Mills, with Lieutenants Townsend, Powell, Bennett, and Harding, with Lieutenants Hutchinson and Davis, Second Battalion. I recommend for promotion for gallantry Sergt. Major Isaac D'Isay, and for mention Color Sergt. Rowland W. Evans. I append a list of casualties in the First Battalion.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. W. SMITH,

Captain, Comdg. Detachment Eighteenth Infantry.

Captain JAMES W. FORSYTH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Brigade.
