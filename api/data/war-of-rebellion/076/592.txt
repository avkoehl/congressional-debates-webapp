LOUDON, August 18, 1864-9.05 p. m.

Captain W. P. AMMEN, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Having only supplied Colonel Byrd with 6,000 rounds, we have plenty of ammunition. Colonel Patterson wishes me to say to you there are only for pieces of artillery here, and thinks if they are crossing with eight he should have more.

N. A. REED,

Aide-de-Camp.

LOUDON, TENN., August 18, 1864-9.25 p. m.

Captain W. P. AMMEN:

Passenger train just arrived; report nearly the same as previous dispatches, and about as uncertain. Colonel Patterson wishes me to state that from conductors and passengers he learns that Humes' division crossed the railroad at Riceville, between Charleston and Athens, and feeling some alarm for Kingston, has dispatched courier. The conductor states the remaining divisions are said to be following Humes', which has the advance, but no account of their having crossed the road has been received. The rebels burned the depot at Athens last night and inflicting much damage on town. Train has just left for Knoxville.

Aide-de-Camp.

LOUDON, TENN., August 18, 1864.

Captain W. P. AMMEN, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Courier from Colonel Byrd states that he had arrived all right at Philadelphia. Citizen from that place writes by same courier that he had heard this morning from ten miles below Philadelphia and there was no trouble. Two men fleeing with their good from Athens report a force from Chattanooga as having engaged the rebels near Athens last night. They know nothing for certain, but only heard it.

N. A. REED,

Aide-de-Camp.

LOUDON, TENN., August 18, 1864.

Captain W. P. AMMEN:

As all the scouts sent out have now returned and have failed to report any enemy, and sufficient times has elapsed for Colonel Byrd to have reported any disaster, I think all chances for attack at this point to be past, and so, unless advised to the contrary, I shall return on first rain that appears.

N. A. REED,

Aide-de-Camp.

LOUDON, TENN., August 18, 1864-11 p. m.

Captain AMMEN, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Courier just in from Kingston. Major Reeves reports two regiments of rebels in Meigs County at 12 m., twenty-three miles from Kingston, moving in that direction.

M. L. PATTERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
