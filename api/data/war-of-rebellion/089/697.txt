Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Beside the rebel deserters already reported six have been received from Fingan, two from Ransom, and one from Lane, making in all twenty-two received at this office to-day. They report nothing additional to what was already reported. Colonel Sharpe writes me that yesterday's Richmond papers report General Sherman to be operating in all the country on the railroads between Atlanta and August and Atlanta and Macon, and on the Georgia Central Railroad. he has taken Milledgeville, and it is supposed Macon also. A body of his cavalry was within a short distance of Augusta. Wheeler fought him on Sunday last and was beaten.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. McENTEE,

Captain, &amp;c.

Stations report all quiet. Jansen reports one train of cars as having passed toward our left on railroad across the Appomattox. As some have expressed doubts about a road being there, I will try and ascertain positively to-morrow.
