HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., february 14, 1865.

Major General J. HOOKER,

Commanding Northern Department, Cincinnati, Ohio:

GENERAL: I have the honor to call you attention to the following facts: When the conspiracy was organized last fall in Indiana and Illinois for the purpose of releasing the prisoners at Camps Douglas and Chase, a lady who resides in Boyle Country in this State, and is a rebel in principle, received letters from an escaped prisoner who was secreted in Chicago, informing her that such a plot existed. These letters came into possession of her husband, who made known their contents to the military authorities. Subsequent events verified his statements. The same party now gives information that his wife is in receipt of letters from the same source as the former, which disclose the fact the General S. B. Buckner, of the rebel army, is now in Chicago perfecting plans to attack Camps Douglas and Chase and release the prisoners. I have reason to believe the statement of the gentleman reliable, and deem it my duty to inform you, that proper action may be taken to thwart their plans.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General.
