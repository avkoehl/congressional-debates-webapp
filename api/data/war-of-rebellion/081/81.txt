Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Per A. T[ERRY].

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 15, 1864-9.20 p.m.

General TERRY:

They are still here and are marching to front. I think they are going with Ames to center. Won't the Second Hampshire make Turner strong enough?

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

GENERAL TERRY'S HEADQUARTERS, June 15, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:

If the Ninth New Jersey and Twenty-third Massachusetts come with Ames it will be just what I desire. Upon General Ames' arrival I shall shorten Turner's front and thus make it strong enough.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

TERRY'S HEADQUARTERS, June 15, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to forward the following report from the lookout station:

From great amount of dust that has been rising from the road between Chaffin's Bluff and Richmond for the last hour and a half it is apparent that there is quite a body of troops moving there, and from the way the dust rose I think they are going toward the river. It is very seldom a man can be seen on the bluff. There is a long line of smoke in the northeast which indicates the burning of much powder.

Later.-A part of the troops and trains have crossed the river. Are coming in this direction.

TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL TERRY'S HEADQUARTERS, June 15, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:

The lookout reports to me that the great clouds of dust heretofore reported seemed to have been caused by two brigades of infantry and about 200 wagons and ambulances crossing Chaffin's farm.

TERRY,

General.
