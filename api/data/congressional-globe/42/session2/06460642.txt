THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 27,
eminent with its business or the acquisition of its
property. Our company has been 'fuictiy pursuing
for the past six years the sarno object which the
British Government has been accomplishing since it
acquired thecontrolof the lines, namely: the unifica-
tion and enlargement of the telegraph system, accom-
panied with an important reduction in the rates for
transmitting messages- With the exception of half
a dozen comparatively small connecting and com-
peting lines, this company controls the whole tele-
graphicsystem of the United States,its lines covering
a territory embracing twenty-five degrees of lati-
tude andfifty-fivedegreos oflongitude. Within the
past fiveyears the telegraphic facilities in tho United
states have been increased by tho construction of
thirty thousandmiles of line, theerection of seventy
thousand miles .of wire, and the opening of over
three thousand telegraph stations, and the annual
increase is constantly augmenting. During the same
period the average rate of tolls has been decreased
fifty per cent. Is it probable that the telegraph
would have made greater progress under Govern-
ment control during the same period ?
The various telegraph companies transacting busi-
ness in competition with the Western Union Com-
pany own about ten thousand miles of line, and are
represented by an aggregate capital of over sixteen
million dollars. It is not probable that these com-
panies have earned enough to cover their current
expenses, and it is well known that some of them
have already incurred debts for a greater amount
than their property is worth. There is every reason,
therefore, why these concerns should look with favor
upon a Government purchase, and I presume that
their managers are actively at work to bring about
It is a fact worthy of mention that although tho
land lines in Europe are almost exclusively owned
by tho various Governments through which they
extend, the submarine lines, over which all the
important communications with Asia, Atrica, Aus-
tralia, and America are transmitted, are owned by
private companies. The length of the submarine
lines now in operation is thirty-six thousand three
hundred and two miles, for the construction of which
upward of sixty million dollars of private capital
has been expended, of which at least one quarter has
boen devoted to the construction of cable lines in
Europe for the express purpose of avoiding the Gov-
ernment land lines, where important communica-
tions were subjected to such serious errors and delays
as to render them comparatively useless. One of
the most marked instances of this kind was the con-
struction of a submarine line from Falmouth, Eng-
land, to Malta, a distance of twenty-eight hun-
dred and sixty-four miles, in order to avoid using
tho Government lines in France. These private sub-
marine telegraph lines can scarcely be overrated in
their relation to the commerce of the world. They
extend beneath the Atlantic and German oceans,
the Baltic. North, Mediterranean, Arabian, China,
Japan, and Red seas, the Persian gulf, the bay of
Biseny, the straits of Gibraltar and Malacca, and
the Gulfs of Mexico and St. Lawrence, thus uniting
the whole civilized world in one continuous chain
ot telegraphic lines. Messages from tho United States
destined tor India, China, Japan, or Australia,
would not pass over a rod of governmental telegrap h
line.
