So tlie House refused to adjourn.
Mr. CLARK, of Missouri. Mr. Clerk, unless
it is the purpose of the House, as has been inti-
mated to me, to adjourn after taking another vote
to-night, in case 110 Speaker is then elected, I pro-
pose to submit some remarks now.
Several Members. Go on.
Mr. BURNETT. I rise to a question of order.
The point of order is this: there is no question
before tho House, and the gentleman from Mis-
souri cannot, therefore, take the floor to deliver
any remarks.
The CLERK. The Clerk having no power to
decide the point of order which has been raised,
will submit it to the House.
Mr. CLARK, of Missouri. There is a ques-
tion before the House—whether we shall proceed
to lake another vote to decide which of the can-
didates for Speaker ought to be elected? My re-
marks will go to show that some of the candidates
ought to be elected, and that others ought not.
They will, therefore, be pertinent to the question
which we have before us.
The CLERK. Shall the gentleman from Mis-
souri be allowed to proceed with his remarks?
[Loud criqg of " No !"' " No !"]
Mr. BURNETT. I withdraw my question of
order.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I renew it.
The CLERK. The question again recurs,
Shall the gentleman from Missouri be permitted
to proceed with his remarks ?
