Major-General AUGUR:

SIR: I have the honor of reporting that previous to receiving your orders to-day I received orders from General hardin to move my command to the front, and along the River road as far as possible, and I have complied with his orders by moving as far as Muddy Branch (commonly known as Major Thompson's camp), and meeting with none of the enemy I have returned to my camp. The enemy's rear guard had left Muddy Branch about one-quarter of an hour before my arrival at that place, and on my return I reported what information I had gained to General Wright, whom I found at Offutt's Cross-Roads.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
