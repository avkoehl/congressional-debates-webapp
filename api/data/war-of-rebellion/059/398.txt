CULPEPER, April 18, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN, Nashville, Tenn.:

General Smith has made requisition for 30,000 cavalry horses. It will be impossible to supply half the number. Use dismounted cavalry to guard depots and stations, and relieve infantry to go to the front. I have sent General Prince to command West Kentucky. He will report to you.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., April 18, 1864-11.30 p.m.

(Received 3 a.m., 19th)

Lieutenant -General GRANT, Culpeper, Va.:

General Sooy Smith made his requisition for horses without consultation with me. I did not expect half the number you name, and indeed had already ordered the dismounted cavalry to be used as you suggest. I have full accounts from General Thomas up to date. None of Johnston's army have gone east. There was a talk in Johnston's camp about Hardee's corps going east. Mere camp talk and nothing more.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, April 18, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

Will the 3,000 head of cattle you require at Cairo be wanted to start with the expedition? The number is so large that I fear I shall have to pay a very high price if I purchase at once. They can be procured, but at not less than 7 cents gross, delivered here. If necessary to have them at once, I will furnish them.

T. J. HAINES,

Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 18, 1864.

Colonel HAINES,

Chief Commissary, Saint Louis:

The price is nothing. I want the Army of the Tennessee to have beef-cattle on the hoof at or near Huntsville by May 1. The easiest way is to send them up to Clifton, on the Tennessee, and drive across. They should come up the Tennessee at the same time with the troops from Cairo.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, April 18, 1864.

General W. T. SHERMAN:

Telegraphed you on the 16th, directed to Moscow. Am using prompt, and I hope successful, means to get the cattle to Bridgeport
