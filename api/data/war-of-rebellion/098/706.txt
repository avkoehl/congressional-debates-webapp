then took position to cover the road leading to the bridge from the enemy's side of the swamp, in a rifle-pit hastily thrown up. The bridge had been so thoroughly destroyed as not to permit the passage of the stream, which at this point was about sixty feet wide, deep and rapid. A small boat, capable of holding two persons, was the only means at hand to cross it. After about twenty men, with Lieutenant-Colonel Kirkup, had crossed, and their efforts at driving off the enemy proved abortive, it was deemed advisable the capture of the enemy, who did not appear to be more than ten or twelve strong. An advance was made and the other side of the swamp nearly gained, when, to the astonishment of all, the enemy opened fire on the party from a section of artillery, causing them to beat a hasty retreat. The men took position behind the barricade, and retained their position on the enemy's side of the stream. Three companies of the One hundred and forty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers were placed in the rifle-pits on the west side of the stream to cover the party on the other side. Darkness having set in no further attempt was made to effect the crossing. A slight fire of musketry was kept up during a party of the night. At 4 a.m. the following morning the crossing was effected without resistance. The bridge was completed during the night by the Michigan Engineers. At the junction of the Edgefield and Orangeburg road with the Columbia road, about one-quarter of a mile from the bridge, the enemy were met in small numbers again. The advance was momentarily checked, the enemy having partially destroyed a small bridge. This was soon allowed to halt again until we had advanced about three-quarters of a mile from the bridge, when I received orders to halt from the general commanding division. The line of the brigade was then formed, covering the Columbia road (the one the enemy had taken), the right resting on the creek and the left near the Edgefield road. In this position we remained until 9 p.m., when the train having passed we brought up the rear to camp, three miles and a half distant.

The casualties in the two skirmishes were Colonel John Flynn, Twenty-eight Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, slightly wounded in foot; 3 enlisted men killed and 9 enlisted men wounded. A nominal list I attached to this report. * Distance marched, February 12 and 13, sixteen miles and a half. Tuesday, February 14, marched in the direction of Lexington. The brigade was distributed as guards along the train; distance marched, six miles and a half. Wednesday, 15th, the Twenty-eighth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Fitzpatrick commanding, and three companies of the One hundred and forty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers formed the advance guard, the brigade being in the advance of the corps. Slight skirmishing occurred at the crossing of the Congaree Creek and at the Two-Notch Cross-Roads. Although the firing was quite brisk at each of these places there were no casualties in the command. The brigade went into camp at the Two-Notch Cross-Roads, our position to command the Columbia road; distance marched, eleven miles. February 16, the brigade was to-day in rear of the train of the corps and acted as rear guard. Marched to within four miles of Columbia; distance marched, seven miles. February 17, marched four miles to near the Saluda River at Leaphart's Mills. February 18, crossed the Saluda River at Leaphart's Mills, and marched in the direction of Alston
