FORT MONROE, VA., July 7, 1863-8 a. m.

Via WHITE HOUSE, July 7.

SIR: Brigadier-General Getty has returned. He found the Fredericksburg Railroad bridge over the South Anna guarded by about 8, 000 men, with fourteen pieces of artillery, under Major-General [Brigadier-General] Cooke. Deeming an attack too hazardous, he proceeded to destroy the railroad track between the bridge were torn up, and the rails burned and twisted. The track was also destroyed at intervals of 3 miles. At Ashland, the depot burned, telegraph instrument brought off, and the trestle bridge destroyed. The communication with Richmond by way of the South Anna over both railroads is effectually destroyed, and the enemy is driven to the Danville, Lynchburg and Charlottesville Railroads to reach the Shenandoah Valley. The force at the bridge is believed, after General Getty left, to have marched back to Richmond. I am sending off three Pennsylvania regiments to Washington. Shall send more troops to-morrow, unless you have other orders. Please reply.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-Genera.

SIR: We feel a good deal chagrined at the slight results of the late operations in your department. General Getty in all probability
