generals in the field and all the departments of the Government. In the case of enrolling officers they are sometimes well founded, and active efforts are made to remedy the evils. In general, however, these complaints are the results of ignorance, or the baffled endeavor to escape the service, or of malice, because the duty of the officers of conscription requires them to exempt certain persons for sufficient legal reasons. I can congratulate you on the assurance that the chief officers in the enrolling service discharge their duties with as much zeal, intelligence, and efficiency as any officers in the Government. There may be defects in the administration of the conscript laws and dereliction among the officers, but I have no hesitation in asserting that the country and the Government has just reason to be satisfied both with the system and the officers. As to the officers of this Bureau immediately under my eye, I have, without undue assumption, great pride in testifying to their zeal, their apt intelligence, their untiring industry and absorbing devotion in the public service.

In view of the important and delicate service you have confided to my administration, I cannot refrain from the expression of my grateful acknowledgment to you and to the eminent public servant who acts as your assistant for the patient and courteous consideration you have given to all and for the enlightened, judicious, and prompt instructions by which you have authorized and enabled me to execute your orders. Of the nature, the extent, the intricacy, and the delicacy of the duties to be performed by the conscription authorities, you have, and what is extremely rare in the country, a full and clear comprehension, and in their performance you have generously permitted me to avail myself habitually of your direct and minute counsels.

JOHN S. PRESTON,

Colonel and Superintendent.
