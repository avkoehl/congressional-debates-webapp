U. S. STEAMER CAMBRIDGE, Newport News, Va., November 18, 1861.

We the undersigned officer of the U. S. steamer Cambridge were attached to her at the time of the capture of the Louisa Agnes and Revere, British schooners. We would hereby testify that the captains of the above vessels and their men had good

accommodations - all that the ship could afford; were regularly served with rations, and upon their departure from this steamer spoke in high terms of approbation of their treatment. At all times on board they appeared perfectly satisfied and made no complaints. The above-mentioned parties had free intercourse with the crew of the Cambridge both and below decks, and in all respects were passengers. The absence of Lieutenant William Gwin's name to this paper is accounted for by his being detached from this vessel and ordered to the brig Perry November 12.

Superintendent of Police, New York.

SIR: I inclose several letters* belonging to parties in New York which have been examined and appear to contain nothing objectionable. I will thank you to visit the persons to whom they are addressed, viz, Messrs. Charles Le Cesne and Ceasar August Robert, and tell them that the Government has conclusive evidence that they have suffered themselves to be made a medium for the transmission of correspondence between the insurrectionary States and Europe some of which is treasonable in character, and require them to engage upon honor that hereafter they will desist from their practice, and if any letter of the character mentioned come into their possession they will voluntarily deliver them to you for examination. If they do this you may for the present discontinue the surveillance over their correspondence.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
