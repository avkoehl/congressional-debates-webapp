serving with Major General Fitz. Lee, viz: Johnston's and Shoemaker's batteries-seven pieces. These batteries have lost heavily in killed and wounded horses in the operations against Sheridan, and the horses are in very bad condition. In Johnston's battery 28 have been killed, or wounded so badly as to make it necessary to abandon them; 5 others wounded are with the battery. Of the other horses 6 are in very bad order, with painful galls on back and neck, and greatly broken down. Two of the gun-carriages have only 5 horses apiece and two others only 4 apiece. Shoemaker's battery is in worse order still; 16 of the horses are covered with sores, and so much broken down by heavy marches as to be unfit for active service. In this battery 4 have been killed, 6 wounded and abandoned, 2 broken down and left on the road, and 2 strayed or stolen. Thirty horses are needed to put this battery in efficient condition. Three mules in ordnance wagons are broken down and unfit for service.

The order directed an inspection to ascertain the number of horses unable to "work in harness." The horses reported are in such an exhausted condition that they are unfit for severe marching or rapid movement, but are still worked in harness. Under these circumstances, I have not directed them to be turned in. A few days of rest would make some of them efficient again. Others are totally unfit for service as horse artillery horses.

Recapitulation.

Johnston's battery:

Horses killed, or wounded and abandoned................. 28

Wounded slightly........................................ 5

Sore-backed and broken down............................. 6

-----

Total (cannoneers and gun horses) deficit..................... 39

Shoemaker's battery:

Killed, or wounded and abandoned......................... 10

Broken down and left..................................... 2

Strayed or stolen........................................ 2

Sore-backed and broken down.............................. 16

Total......................................................... 30

Thomson's battery: Killed, or wounded and abandoned........... 16

Hart's battery (1 piece inspected):

Sore-backed and broken down................................... 2

McGregor's battery:

-----

12

----

Aggregate................................................ 99

Many of the cannoneers have been dismounted to supply the teams. One hundred fresh horses is the least number with which the batteries will be able to perform efficient service.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. ESTEN COOKE,

Captain and Assistant Inspector-General.
