HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,August 25, 1864-4.30 p. m.

General BIRNEY,

I have ordered Graham to send up his boats and request Captain Smith to send up boats. It looks as if rebs intended making an attack on our front.

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-6.20 p. m.

General BIRNEY,

Tenth Army Corps:

I telegraphed General Meade to know if his necessities on the left made more men necessary to him, and he replied that he is not posted as to the result of this evening's battle, but as General Hancock has repulsed several attacks to-day he thinks the last must have resulted the same. As Hancock can do no more damage to the railroad he will be withdrawn. For this reason I have ordered General Paine to report to you with his troops (three regiments) as soon as they could be relieved and march over. You can place him where his services will be most needed.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

OLD HEADQUARTERS [EIGHTEENTH] ARMY CORPS,

August 25, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

Upon reflection I think that 3,000 colored troops are more needed on this front than yours, and shall keep them unless I receive information from General Meade they will not be needed. A severe battle has been going on all evening on our extreme left.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
