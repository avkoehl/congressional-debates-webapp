DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS,

March 29, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

Deserter from Finegan's brigade, Mahone's division, on Bermuda front, says that yesterday at 12 m., when he left, everything was quiet and no movements. Sheridan's cavalry were heard plainly when they crossed the James. That accounts for Fitzburg Lee's cavalry moving yesterday.

FRED. L. MANNING,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Provost-Marshal-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF BERMUDA HUNDRED, VA.,March 29, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL,

Commanding:

Name of battery here is Seventh New York Independent Battery, commanded now by First Lieutenant M. V. McIntyre. Following dispatch just received from Cobb's Hill tower:

A column of about 5,000 cavalry passed on the turnpike going toward Petersburg. The enemy has apparently diminished his force in front of this tower, as very few men can be seen.

I would have sent it to you, but suppose it had been sent direct. Is there any discretion permitted you about moving on the enemy's works in any contingency?

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

HATCHER'S FARM, March 29, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL,

Commanding:

No change on the right. Had a reconnaissance on left last night; result not yet known; will inform you immediately. Two deserters from beyond the river near Petersburg think there is a change on left. Do you know where the terrific cannonading was last night, its objects and results?

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.
