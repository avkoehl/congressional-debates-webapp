at least 600; prisoners, 105, of which over 50 are wounded. We lost one gun, without caissons; 25 mules and 6 horses, belonging to the Eighty-third, were killed and wounded. Flood's battery lost 41 horses killed and disabled for service. A barge containing a large quantity of hay belonging to the United States was destroyed.

Many soldiers lost their blankets and clothing, which were taken from their quarters by the enemy. I have no accurate list of arm captured; some have been turned over and some have not. I have ordered all to be turned over to the post quartermaster. As soon as I can obtain a list of our loss of arms, I will send to you a report of the same.
