sion and wrong suffered by them from the usurped authority imposed on them serves but to render their remembrance of the olden time the more to be valued by them. I think a local force should be raised there, loyal and true, sufficiently strong to guard themselves if arms were furnished them and an opportunity given them to organize.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., February 27, 1865.

MAJOR: I have the honor to make the following additional report, omitted in my report of this date, and herewith inclosed.

While in Northern Arkansas and Southern Missouri large numbers of Union refugees immediately prepared to avail themselves of the opportunity thus presented of escaping from the despotism and dangers oppressing them. They were nearly all of the better class of citizens, many of them wealthy farmers, but they owned that if they remained longer there they would almost certainly be conscripted into the rebel army, or, resisting that, be killed. They stated that to attempt to escape, excepting under protection of our forces, would be certain death-a statement, incredible as it may seem, I found to be only too true, as one of them, moving a little too quick, and being in advance only about four miles, was shot. There were about thirty families, and I could not abandon them to their fate. I did move slowly, and so arranged my force as to protect them and their teams and household goods and what little stock they had along with them, occasionally taking teams of oxen for one day to assist their jaded teams (with the consent of the owners), all of which were returned to the owners. I obtained and gave some of the more destitute meal to subsist upon, paying for same from my own money, and at other times obtaining it from wealthy rebel citizens. It was a case of stern necessity. It was starvation or food for women and children. It delayed my return a few days, but humanity demanded the delay. I could not abandon them ; they had already suffered incredible hardships. They will not become a charge upon the Government, but will all be able to earn a livelihood. Although this may not have been strictly military, I confidently rely upon the well-known charity and kind feelings of the commanding general toward these unfortunate victims of this accursed rebellion to justify me in thus acting toward them.

I am, major, very respectfully,

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding Expedition.
