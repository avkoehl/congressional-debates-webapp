(Received 3. 40 p. m.)

Major-General POPE:

General Mitchell's district headquarters are at Omaha. He has been on the plains all winter. He meets the troops at Kearny. his presence at Omaha was necessary to get out our supplies. I have had to send all our forage from that point and subsistence stores from here. Colonel Moonlight is moving down from Denver, and I can keep the line open. The troops going forward, with those I can spare from the forts, will make a campaign against the Indians immediately.

G. M. DODGE,
