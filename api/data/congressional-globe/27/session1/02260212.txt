A.nd the reason why competent officers ha^^ been remored,
and incompetent men, of bad character, appointed in their
places "
Mr BOTfS declined the suggestion
Mr CLIFFORD asked a division of the lesolution, so as
to take the question on Mr Davis's and Mr Botts's sepa
rately.
Mi STANLY moved to lay the whole subject upon the table
The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr AD \MS called for the reading of the resolution
Mr TURNEY of Tennessee asked if the reading of the reso
lution was in oidei, it having >een read once
The CHAIR said it was in order
Mr TUR.NEV said hehad no objection to the reading, but
he desuedtohavea uniform rule The other day he asked to
have a bill read on its final passage, that had not been read at
all and it was refused He theretore appealed from the deci
aion of the Chair
The question was then taken, and the decision of the Chair
sustained The question was then taken on the motion to lay
the resolution on the table, and resulted in yeas 05, nays 114.
So the House refused to lay the resolution on the table
Mr ALFORD of Georgia rose to a question of order He
said the subject wag not embraced m the Pi event's message,
and was therefore not in order under a late rule of the House
Mr WILLIAMS of North Carolina asked the Clerk to lead
the rule

[Mr Pickens] had held a hffeient opinion and use 1 very dif
feient language m his celebiatel repoit as chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Rela ions in that dicument it had been
tieattd as a solemn matter, and as presenting an i^sue of
peace or war How lar that repoit might or might not have
contributed to hasten or to produce «uch an issue, Mi C
would not undertake to say   but the question between the two
Governments was certainly a serious question during the for-
mer Administration.
Mr CLIFFORD here interposed, and called upon Mr Ccsu-
iNGtosay whether there was any thing in that report [Pick-
ens's] which he then denied or now denies1?
Mr CUSHING said it would not be m order, nor would it be
delicate toward the committee, to go into any thing that had
passed there on that occasion
Mr CLIFFORD again called upon hism to affirm or deny
Mr CUSHING said he did not choose to answer that question,
as V was not now before the committee When he thought it
material he would answer it Mr C expressed his high grati
fication at the patriotic and honorable tone of th° remarks of
Mr Rhett, in regard to his readiness to stand by the country
whenever her honor should be assailed, and he regretted that
the question should ever have been mooted a3 to what Admi
nistration it was under which a national difficulty should have
arisen But as the question had been raised, he desired that the
facts should be accurately stated and understood Should a
solemn public question grow of the existing state of things, he
trusted the Committee on Fereign Relations would continue to
present as on all such questions it had hitherto presented, an
undivided front.
Mi RH& 11 disclaimed any intention, in the remarks he had
made to impute blame to the present Admimstiation, or com-
mendation to that which had lately been m power as to thib
McLeod controversy And under which of them the question
had become so serious a matter was perfectly immaterial His
only intention in alluding to it had been to repei the accusation
made by a gentleman from Ohio, [Mr Mason,] that gentlemen
attachedto the late Administration, and who were now very
violent in relation to the honor of the nation, as connected with
that question, had formerly submitted with all patience and qui
etness to insult and outrage on the American peeple It had
not been his intention to censure either Administration All he
had meant to insist upon was, that the McLeod case, with ua
sutroundmg difficulties, on¿u<att;d, m its present ominous as
pect, under tl is rather than under the last Administration As
to its first commencement, indeed, every body knew that it had
originated thiee years ago It was true that Mi Fox's letter
had been written it Deccmbci, bu in saying it had been written
hut a fpweeks befoie the fate Administration went out o*" power,
he had spoken loosely and goneially, but correctly enough, with-
out aiming at exactnesb Now, as to the tone of that Adminis-
tration as thib question, had they, as soon as Mr Fox's letter
was leceived, taken exiieme giound m íegard to the demand it
contained, it would have been said that they had vapored in se-
cuuty, knowing that the results would 1 ave to be met and car
ned out by others who weie to succeed them
Mr R insisted that there was a wide and obvious difference
between the tone of Mr Fox when addressing Mr Foisyth
and his late letter to Mr Webster, and he quoted the former
letter to show this In the first letter he had spoken without
full authority It was a ' cal] on the Government of the United
States to interfere to obtain the release of McLeod," but the lat
ter "the demand of the immediate liberation" of McLeod, was
made after communication and instruitions received from
his Government at home It was this letter and Mr Webster's
answer t > it which const tuted the issue hetween the two na-
tions and in relation to mat i sue it was his own opinion that
one of the two nations must iccede, or else a íesort to war
seemed inevitable Now «¡uch an issue had not existed under
the last Adminibtiation it had been pioduced by the corre
spondence which had recently passed since thepiesent Admi-
nistiatiun bad come into power Whether McLeod should
be hung or acquitted, there still remained a demand upon Great
Britain for satisfaction for the invasion of our teintory and the
destruction oi the Caroline lor no Administration would ever be
¡sustained by the Ameucao people which showed a willingness
to bow at the feet of any ioieign powei The gentleman from
Massachusetts insisted that the question had been a serious one
befoie the late Adm nistration ^ave up the reins, and he lefer-
red to the fact of the printing of his colleague's [Mr Pickens's]
leport bntthe mere punting oí a re port inferred no sanction
oi approval of all it contained it was a mere act of of ordinary
courtesy to a standing committee of the House Gentleman
contmuilly voted to punt report-, to every line of which they
were utteilv opposed Mi R had voted to print the late re-
port ol the "iecietaty of the lieasuiy, though he believed it to
bo stuffed wi h errois fiom one end of if to the Other True, the
report [Mi Pickens's] had pioduced some excitement m
Lurope, but there had been no action of Ccngress upon it
The excitement arose not from its deuflsastu the Caroline
affair, nor the positions it assumed with respect to it The
details were familiar, and the same position had been assumed
before, in Mr Forsyth's communication, when our Govern-
ment was first informed that Gieat Bniam acknowledged
the ao t to be done by hei authority It was not the case of the
Caroline that created the excitement, but it was the ani-
madversions—the report con amed on the ambition and ar-
íogance of England, hei ambition m pretending to universal
dominion, in pushing her conquests into all quarters of the
world, and her insolence m tiebpas¡=mg, whenever it suits her
interests, on the rights of other nations It was this which was
calculated to awaken all nations to her asgie«sions—which ir
ritated and enraged hei people li such suggestions make af-
fairs 'serious" with Great Bntam, it only showed that we at
least a«s an independent nation, should be still more jealous of
our righto Concession was not the way to security with such
a power
After a word or two of explanation by Mr   Cushing to Mr
Rhdtt—
Mr PICKENS said that he was glad that an opportunity had
at length been presented to him ofmakms some explanations
in reference to the histoiy of the report to which allusion had
been made He had not been present yes erday when the re
marks of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr Mason] had been
made From this morr ing'g repor m the Intelligencer, it ap-
peared that that gentleman had evinced a disposition to consi
dei Mr P as the author of the leport intended to excite agita
lion on both sides of the water, and to throw the lesponsibih
ty of the consequences upon the present Administration Mr
P should say as little as possible on a subject so delicate, as be
did not consider this the proper tribunal for the discussion of
high and delu ate questions of diplomatic intercourse It would
be recollected (hat a resolution had been introduced into the
House by the gentleman from New York, now chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, [ \Ir Fillmore] at the close
of the last session calling on the President for the correspon
dence with the British Government m relation to the burning
of the steamboat Caroline, in which the demand had been made
