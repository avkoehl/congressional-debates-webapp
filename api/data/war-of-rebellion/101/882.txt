New Orleans, La., February 17, 1865.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Your note of yesterday is received. In accordance with Special orders, Numbers 41, current series, from your headquarters, the Seventh Vermont Volunteers was ordered on the 13th instant to immediately move to Dauphin Island. It has not yet gone, and I am informed the reason is that they can gt no transportation. I have not yet ordered away the other regiments, as they are to move with an interval of two days, in accordance with the same order. I have directed the Twentieth U. S. Colored Infantry to come down and replace one of these regiments, though I wanted to retain it at the Parapet to furnish a force for putting the works there in repair. The Indiana heavy artillery furnished a large force for guard duty, and this regiment is likewise ordered away. It will therefore be necessary to have another regiment detailed for guard duty in the city, and in order to be sufficient it should be a large one.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. W. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, La., February 17, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER CARROLLTON:

Send Twentieth U. S. Colored Infantry to this city to relieve the Seventy-seventh Illinois Volunteers. They will encamp until Wood's Press is vacated. They will march down.

By order of Brigadier-General Sherman:

FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
