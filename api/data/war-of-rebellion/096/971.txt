HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 14, 1865. (Received 10.45 p.m.)

Major-General WEBB:

Several deserters in from McRae's brigade report that two of Gordon's divisions moved last night to intercept Sheridan, and that when seen last were moving across South Side Railroad to cross Appomattox by pontoon bridge. Learned this from one of their men returning from North Carolina who met the troops and who said it was reported when he left home that Sherman was at Fayetteville; that their troops had been driven from Kinston; had afterward abandoned Goldsborough; that Johnston's headquarters were at Raleigh, where he was concentrating, and intended to make a stand. These reports are doubtful, as the dates given don't correspond with dispatches received from Schofield. Other deserters from First South Carolina know nothing of the movements of the two divisions of Gordon's corps, but say that Johnson's division was relieved to-day by a division from their right, and that a letter dated the 9th says that Sherman was in Fayetteville.

Major-General.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

All quiet along our lines this a.m. The cannonading of yesterday was commenced by the enemy opening upon some of our troops drilling near the Avery house. No reason for the yelling along the rebel lines and increased picket-firing has as yet been ascertained. Nine deserters came in during the night, all from Johnson's division.
