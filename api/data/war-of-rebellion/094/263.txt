this campaign. If Lyon's mounted troops have not recrossed the Cumberland during the late thick fog, they will be captured. The country people along this river confidently expected Hood to drive the Union forces out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The great disappointment at General Thomas' victories will probably cause the Kentuckians, Tennesseeans, and North Alabamians to desert and disperse Hood's command. I shall immediately shift sufficient force to destroy Hood's pontoons at Duck River and Florence, and cut off Hood and Lyon's retreat, if stage of water in the Tennessee is sufficient. A full report of successful naval operations on this river will be sent-made as soon as detailed reports are received.

CLARKSVILLE, December 18, 1864-1.15 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I thank you for informing me that Hood has a pontoon bridge at Florence and is reported building one at month of Duck River. I will ascertain, as soon as the existing fog on this river allows us to push a suitable naval force up the Tennessee River, if there be water enough in that river, under Lieutenant Corner, to destroy these bridges and cut off Hodd's retreat, and prevent Lyon recrossing Tennessee River, should he now recross the Cumberland under cover of the fog.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding.

I am hopeful that the Tennessee River of the iron-clads and gun-boats will be able to reach Florence within six days from the present time, as that will be just about the right time. I shall be much obliged if, in addition to the movement on the Tennessee River mentioned above, you will be s well prepared as possible to convoy either form Johnsonville or Clifton a fleet of transports with troops up the Tennessee River to Florence. I speak of this simply that you might be prepared in case I make he request. Your telegram of 6.20 p. m. [17th] is just received.
