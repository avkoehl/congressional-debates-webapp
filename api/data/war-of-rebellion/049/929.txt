HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,November 29, 1863.

[Captain C. C. SUYDAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:]

SIR: There is northing new to report. I will move my headquarters to-day to near Ely's Ford, and will throw one brigade over the river to scout the country there.

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,November 29, 1863-3.20 p. m.

[Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:]

SIR: A strong attack of about one brigade of cavalry, and possibly infantry, is being made on the brigade near New Hope Meeting-House. The First Brigade, at the Wilderness, has also been attacked and communication cut between the two. These points are very important, and so assailable that considerable force will be required to hold either. The road from this point back to Robertson's Tavern is blocked with wagons, which do not move beyond this point. With my division here I could hold this point. The brigade here has been hard pressed, but I think we will hold. I have communicated with General Warren in front.

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

I think it probable General Warren will send some infantry here.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1863.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

I do not think our position has been discovered. They evidently know of some movement near here by their random firing over the troops. Your P. S. is noted.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,November 30, 1863.

[Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:]

In answer to your dispatch just received, I respectfully report that I do not believe the enemy's works can be carried in my front by an assault without numerous sacrifices. I regard the chances as three to one against the success of such an attack.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
