Major MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your telegram received. I will send an officer to investigate and report in regard to the capture at Springfield yesterday. I fear it will turn out a great disgraceful affair. It is reported that the men had turned out a great disgraceful to graze, and a large number of the men were in the river bathing when attacked. It was, as I expected, McNeill's and Harness' men, under command of McNeill himself, who had just returned from the Shenandoah Valley. Loss about 60 men and 100 horses, with equipments, &amp;c.

I supposed this order had been executed, but this a.m. I received the following telegram from Colonel Wilkinson. May I suggest that the two companies now at Clarksburg be permitted to remain there for the present instead of proceeding to Parkersburg, as they may be required to expel guerrilla bands in that neighborhood.

CLARKSBURG, June 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

Two companies of the Eleventh Virginia Infantry are at Parkersburg and two will arrive here to-night from the interior. I ordered Major Simpson to start by rail to-morrow and take up the companies here for Martinsburg. He answered
