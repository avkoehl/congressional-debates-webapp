Memorandum for Lieutenant-General Hardee:

First Maxey's brigade has just been sent to Mobile. Gregg's at Enterprise, and McNair's at Meridian, are at those places to be ready to follow whenever Mobile is threatened. In such an event the two brigades at Newton are intended to follow also, and that here if there should be time. If not it should guard railroads.

Second. The chief commissary has been instructed to draw everything possible in the way of subsistence from the northwest, collecting it a Canton. The quartermaster's department has had similar orders, and to transport in wagons to Brandon.

Third. Major-General Lee is instructed to transfer Colonel Logan's command to some other part of the frontier. Some other troops to replace it, and to investigate the circumstances of the reported murder of prisoners near Jackson, La. Also to have Du Monteil's regiment organized when convenient. Mullen's company, however, which is on outpost duty for Mobile, not to be moved, but to continue on that duty.

Fourth. I took quarters in Brandon yesterday, and have ordered the removal of my office to that place.
