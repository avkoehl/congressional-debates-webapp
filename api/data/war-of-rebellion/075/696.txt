HEADQUARTERS CLEBURNE'S DIVISION,On Sugar Valley Road, May 11, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: My pickets on my old picket-line have not been relieved since Sunday morning. I fear they will suffer for rations. If it is still necessary to maintain the picket, I respectfully ask that my detail be relieved from some command near to the point; at this distance it is impossible for me to relieve or supply it with rations, or even to know in what condition they are. I would also call your attention to the fact that when General Lowrey was ordered to Dug Gap he left a company from the Thirty-third Alabama Regiment on picket on the Cleveland road. I respectfully ask that it be relieved and ordered to report to General Lowrey. I am ordered by General Hood to move at sunrise this morning to a point on the Sugar Valley road, five miles south of the point where the road turns to go to Dug Gap, to threaten the enemy and under certain circumstances to attack him.

Very respectfully,

P. R. CLEBURNE,

Major-General.

I am informed that General Govan's brigade has been ordered to join me.

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 11, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General HOOD,

Resaca:

General Johnston wishes all the freight trains to come up. You were directed to prevent any train to come this side of Tilton till the troops got down. As the troops are not going, remove the restriction and set the road free.

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CLEBURNE'S DIVISION,May 11, 1864-5 p. m.

Lieutenant General J. B. HOOD:

Have not yet heard from or found General Cheatham. He is not on the Sugar Valley road, so all persons report who have come up this after-noon from Dalton. The enemy seem to be moving everything in this direction. This is the impression of every one, but whether their destination is Resaca or not, I am unable to say.

Respectfully,

P. R. CLEBURNE,

Major-General.
