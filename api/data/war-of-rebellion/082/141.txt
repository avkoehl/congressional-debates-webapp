HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Va., July 10, 1864.

Colonel J. B. HOWELL,

Eighty-fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers, Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: I am directed by the brigadier-general commanding to send you the inclosed* statement of the percentage sick among the troops of this division and to call your attention to the fact that each of the four regiments of your brigade is in a worse sanitary condition than any other, with but one exception, in the command, and that the average of the First Brigade is nearly 19 per cent. as compared with 15 per cent. in the Second Brigade, and 7 per cent. in the Third Brigade.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT POWHATAN, July 10, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

I have had the telegraph wire repaired below here, and I have got reason to believe that the inhabitants along the line protect and harbor the men that destroy it. My officer reports they were fired upon three times from houses on Cabin Point. What course shall I pursue in regard to citizens along line?

G. S. INNIS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
