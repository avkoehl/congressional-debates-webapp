CORINTH, October 10, 1863.

General HURLBUT:

The following just received:

The cavalry which have returned from the have exhausted their ammunition, owing to which fact I shall not be able to move upon the enemy until the morning of the 11th October, 1863, which I will try and do before daybreak. I think the enemy will move east. Would respectfully suggest that a force sent in the direction of Ripley to co-operate with me would aid very much in crushing or capturing the enemy. Nothing new from the front this evening.

Respectfully,

T. W. SWEENY,

Brigadier-General.

There must be some mounted men with artillery, and I think he should take Spooner's brigade and attack.

CARR,

Brigadier-General.
