■ ven worth.

chandise exported" in the original packages to Chi-
huahua and Sarite Fe, in Mexico.
An act for the organization of a company of sap-
pers, miners, and pontoniers.
Mr. BURKE stated that one of the tollers ap-
pointed on the part of the House [Mr. Joseph R.
Ingersoll] to count the votes of the electors for
President and Vice President was unable, from in-
disposition, to attend; and he therefore moved that
another teller be appointed in his place.
This motion being agreed to.
The SPEAKER appointed Mr. J. P. Kennedy
to serve as teller in place of Mr. Ingersoll.
COUNTING THE VOTES FOR PRESIDENT
AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
Mr. BRODHEAD said that the hour having
arrived which was set apart by a joint resolution of
the two Houses for counting the votes for the elec-
tors for President and Vice President, he begged
leave to oiler the usual resolution. Mr. B. then of-
fered a resolution that a message be sent to the Sen-
ate to inform that body that the House was now
ready to leceive them, and proceed to the opening
of the ixrtilicutcs and counting the votes given by
the electoral colleges. The resolution having been
agreed to, a message was accordingly sent to the
Senate by R. B. French, esq. the clerk of the
House.
The Senate soon after entered the hall of the
House of Representatives, two abreast, preceded by
their Seigcant-at-arms, who was succeeded by their
President, the Hon. Wiue P. Mangum, and Secre-
tary, Asbury Dickins, esq. The senators took
seats prepared for them in the central area of the
■' House, and the President of the Senate took the
chair of the Speaker, (the Hon. John W. Jones,)
the last-named officer being seated on his left. The
tellers (the Hon. Robert J. Walker, of the Sen-
ate, and the Hon. Edmund Burke and the Hon.
John P. Kennedy, of the House of Representa-
tives) took their seats at the Clerk's desk, assisted
by the Secretary of the Senate and B. B. French,
esq., the Clerk of the House. L. Machin, esq.,
principal clerk of the Senate, and D. Gold, esq.,
principal clerk in the office of the clerk of the House
of Representatives, acted as recording clerks, being
seated in front of the clerk's desk at a table prepared
for their use in the central area.
The galleries were densely crowded in every
part, a large number of the auditors being la-
dies.
The PRESIDENT of the Senate rose when the
members of the House and the senators were all seated,
and stated the object of theii' thus assembling to be
to count the votes cast by the electors of the respec-
tive States of this Union for President and Vice
President of the United States; and handing to Mr.
Walker (one of the tellers) a sealed packet, he
said, "I deliver to the gentlemen tellers the votes of
the electors of the State of Maine for President and
Vice President of the United States, in' order that
they may be counted."
Mr. WALKER received the packet; and having
broken the seals, the tellers examined the votes,
which were announced to be nine in number, all of
which were given for James K. Polk, of Tennessee,
as President of the United States. The same num-
ber of votes for the Vice President were given for
George M. Dallas, of Pennsylvania.
The PRESIDENT next delivered to the tellers
the votes of the electors of New Hampshire, and of
all the other States of the Union in succession in the
same manner, and they were examined by the tel-
leis, and the result was announced with the same
formalities.
The final re?ult stood thus:

ry, accompanied by statements of the accounts of

Mr. FAIRFIELD presented the following reso-
lutions, adopted by the legislature of Maine, in rela-
tion to the annexation of Texas and the occupation
of Oregon:
Revolved, That obedience to the will of the people is  .
fundamental principle ol democracy.
y Resolved, That the question of the annexation of Texas tc?
the United States was appropriately and directly presented
to the people for their consideration, and after full discus-
sion has buen decided aftinndtively; and it now becomes the
duty of the government to take immediate and effectual
steps lor the consummation of the measure at the earliest
practicable period.
Jiesohed, That the governments of Texas and the United
States have a right to make tioaties and stipulations, and
enter into alliances and compacts, and that the government
of Texas,in ceding hertemtory. and the government of the
United States, in accepting the cession of said territory, ex-
ercise powers which no other government or people should
be suffered to impair or deleat.
Ib-solvcd, That the questions of the annexation of Texas,
and the occupation of Oregon, are great national questions,
and as such have been ^canvassed and passed upon by the
peeple, and any attempt to place them upon sectional
grounds and to make them subservient to local interests, is
calculated to endanger the success of those measures.
Resolved, That the Territory ol Oregon, extending, on the
Pacific ocean, from the forty -second device to fiftj -four de-
grees and forty minutes north latitude, belongs to the
United States; and it is the imperative duty of the gov-
ernment to occupy the same, and extend its sole jurisdic-
tion over said territory, without unnecessary delay.
Resolved, That our senators in Congress be instructed,
and our representatives be requested, to use their best ex-
ui lions to secuie the annexation of Texas to the United
States, and the occupation of Oregon, in conformity with
the foregoing resolutions.
Resoh ed, That the secretary ot state forward to each of our
senators and representatives in Congress, a copy of these
resolutions.
Mr. FAIRFIELD availed himself of the occa-
sion to say that he fully recognised the democratic
doctrine of the right of instruction on the part of
the constituent, and a corresponding on the part of
the representative to obey; and that his course in
the Senate upon these great Texas and Oregon
questions would be in accordance with these
views.
The resolutions were read, ordered to lie oil the
table, and be printed.
Mr. ATHERTON presented a remonstrance from
inhabitants of the town of Uicenficld, in the State
