A large number of men not belonging to the Army of the Potomac were received fat the Depot Field Hospital, Virginia, and sent forward immediately to Point of Rocks, Va., by transports, but, in consequence of the great number of these patients and their rapid arrival and departure, the surgeons in charge of the corps hospitals failed to register their names, and they are not borne upon the records of the depot hospital.

The number of patients treated in the hospital after the removal to Alexandria, Va., amounted to 1,446.

The supply of water for the depot hospital at City Point, Va., was received from flowing springs found under the bluffs of the Appomattox. The water was raised to a reservoir, at a proper elevation, by two stationary engines, conveyed by pipes to the respective corps hospitals, some of which were half a mile distant, and an abundant supply kept constantly on hand. the general sanitary condition of the hospitals was invariably good; neither gangrene or any epidemic appeared; good order, discipline, and cleanliness were constantly maintained. There was ever an ample supply of all medical and hospital stores, and every luxury and comfort required by the sick and wounded was furnished by the medical department with the least possible delay, and in concluding it is proper to refer to the efficiency of the following-named surgeons in charge of the respective corps: Actg. Staff Surg. John Aiken, Second Army Corps; W. L. Faxon, surgeon Thirty-second Massachusetts Volunteers, Fifth Army Corps; Asst. Surg. J. Sykes, esq., U. S. Volunteers, Sixth Army Corps; W. O. McDonald, surgeon, U. S. Volunteers, Ninth Army Corps; C. A. McCall, U. S. Army, Cavalry Corps; H. Bendell, surgeon Eighty-sixth New York Volunteers, in charge sub-depot at Burkeville, Va.
