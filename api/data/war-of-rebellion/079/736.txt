DECATUR, November 10, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

The river is still rising, and all the small streams are very much swollen. Everything quiet here. No news from any quarter which indicates a movement of the enemy.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, November 10, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

The line has been cut both sides of us and is just repaired. We need cavalry to keep it up.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

HUNSTVILLE, November 10, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Telegram from Major-General Wilson ordering two battalions of Eleventh Indiana Cavalry to Nashville for remounting is just received. I am carrying out the order. That portion of the Eleventh and Thirteenth Indiana Cavalry now mounted I respectfully ask to be retained here as I have no other mounted force to keep off the guerrillas who are constantly about us, rolling rock on the track and tearing up the road. It is indispensably necessary that this mounted force be kept here as I have none other to patrol the river.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, November 10, 1864-2 p. m.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Huntsville, Ala.:

Your dispatch of this a. m. received. You can retain the mounted men of the Indiana cavalry regiments to patrol the road and keep off guerrillas, as you suggest.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

TAYLOR'S SPRINGS, ALA., November 10, 1864-10. 05 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch of the 9th, 3 p. m., just received. Scout from below Florence, on Tennessee River, reports one corps and Roddeys' cavalry at Florence; the other two corps occupying Tuscumbia and Iuka. No troops at Eastport and they believe none at Corinth. All the streams high and the Tennessee River rising rapidly. As soon as Shoal Creek and Cypress admit of crossing I will push in their pickets and try and camp nearer the enemy's command.

Very truly, you obedient servant,

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.
