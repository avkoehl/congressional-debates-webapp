RESOLUTIONS AS TO ORGANIZATION.
Mr. DUNN. I now move the adoption of the
resolutions which I have sent to the Clerk's desk,
and demand the previous question. .
The resolutions were reported, as follows:
nrSeSnrteH^,,Tilat/CT?anl"lS the political complexion of the
present Hou-se oi Representatives as indicating tile un-
doubted seiituiicnto ot a large majonty of tlie people of tile
United States against the act of the last eoagrci ren«al-
mg the lestrietlOii against slavery ill the Teiutones of Kan-
sas and lVebra&ka imposed by the eoinpioinise of 1820, no
l? ,bo choscn Sicker of this body who does
not tuhy and heamly harmomza with that sentiment, or
who Will hesitate to exert himself earnestly foi the restora-
tion oj tiiat restiiction, m teims or in substance.
Resolve;?, That said restriction ought to be restored as
an aet ot ju-Uce to ail the p-jople of the United States, as a
piop^i vmcication oi the wisdom, patuotism, and plighted
honor ot tne groat statesmen who unpo-sed it, and"as a .
ne.essay i; ant! certain means ot reviving that eoneoid and
haunonv among tile States of the American Union which
are essential to the weliaic of our people and the pei netuitv
oi our m^tmitions. 1 J
Resolved, That a useless and factious agitation of thB
slaveiy qacstipu, m or out ot Coiujicss, is u.iwise, uniust
to a petition ot tne Amaicaii people, and, to some extent,
llijuiious to every section ot our country, and therefore
should not he countenanced; but unul the Mi^ouu restne-
01 1820 sliall have been ie tored, 111 lact or 111 sub-
s.anco, to tne said Terutoiies of Kansas and Nebiaska,
fdU/ and completely, to tnat.estent and for t,nt puipose it
!3 oil! solemn duty to thj past, the present, and tiie futule,
