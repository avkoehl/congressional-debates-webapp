1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Met
Mountains served by the Department at the same rate of
expenditure with those on the west, it would require an-
nually $126,893,394 for its support, instead of $14,934,493 33
now actually expended by it."
It strikes me, sir, with all due deference to the
Postmaster General—a gentleman of great intel-
ligence and ability—that this is a very improper
view to take of the expenditure of money for the
benefit of the great West. If, sir, our postal sys-
tem is to be framed and considered solely with a
view to the amount of money received by it, and
to the number of persons to be supplied with let-
ters, why, then, not only its' founders miscon-
ceived, but its whole management has been con-
ducted upon a plan illy adapted to achieve these
results. J t would be far better for the Govern-
ment to abrogate entirely the whole Post Office De-
partment, if this view of its mission is correct.
You would not only destroy a vast amount of pat-
ronage and all its corrupting influences, but save a
vast cost to the Government, and at the same time
would, through the instrumentality of express
companies, hove your citizens more expeditiously
and quite as economically supplied with tlfeir
mail matter.
The entire scope of the general mail policy of
ourGovernmentis,that it gives the sanction,aid,
and power of the Government, not only in carry-
ing your mail matter, but, at the same time, a gen-
- eral governmental protection is given to citizens
throughout an immense extent of country where
you have no army to prevent violence or insure
safety of property.
Rut, beyond this, the whole system cements
and binds together, through the instrumentality
of the Government itsclf^all portions of a widely-
extended and diversified country.
If, sir, the question of receipts is to determine
the extent of postal facilities which you would
give the great West, then, indeed, they would be
so limited that you had better abrogate them en-
tirely, and thus stop all expense to the Govern-
ment. You have got, by the expenditure of money
as proposed by this great overland mail system,
the benefiting of two important States upon the
Pacific, with a population of six to eight hundred
thousand souls. In less than a decade you will
have along these very routes an almost continuous
chain of sovereign States—Washington, Arizona,
Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Nebraska, and other pres-
ent and contemplated Territories will be organ-
ized, and in less time than ten years will be States
of this Confederacy. These great overland routes
become national highways, over which the. emi-
grant with his property passes with a feeling of
security to himself and family, to such home as
ho may select in any portion of yourvastwestern
domain. This whole overland system will be but
a valuable auxiliary to strengthen your Govern-
ment, people your Territories, and develop the
resources of our now virgin soil. Other enlight-
ened Governments pursue the same policy winch
it is intended to carry out by this great overland
system. 1 need but cite you to one—our moihei
country England, who has extended her power,
her commerce, her territory, by a postal system,
which, like a net-work, covers the civilized world.
Her enterprise is continually finding new chan-
nels for trade and commerce, regardless in then-
inception as to the cost, knowing full well that
they will be amply reimbursed ill the end. I!y
this increase of mail facilities through her steam-
ers, she has almost monopolized the commerce of
the Indies, South America, China, Mexico, and
othei countries, hich, from our natural advan-
tageous position, a far-seeing policy would have
enabled us to control.
I bog the attention of the Senate, for a moment,
while 1 give an epitome of tile several ocean malls
put in operation by, under the control of, and paid
for, by the English Government. It shows the
liberality and extensive system of that power-
ful and enlightened country. The mails for the
British American possessions are conveyed from
England—
1. By the Cunard packets; for which, includ-
ing the branch services between Newfoundland,
Halifax, Bermuda, and St. Thomas, the British
Government pays ^101,040, or $,955,200, per an-
num .
2. By a line of packets between Liverpool and
Portland m winter, and Liverpool and Q.uebec in
summer, subsidized by the Canadian government.
3. By a line of packets between Gahvay and St.
John's, Newfoundland; subsidized by the govern-
ment, of Newfoundland.
The sea postage derived from the correspond-
ence between England and the North American
possessions (British Columbia and Vancouver's
Island not included) amounts to about <£11,300,
or $56,500, per annum.
Letters for Vancouver's Island and British Co-
lumbia are sent to New York, and are conveyed
thence either overland "or by United States mail
packets as far as San Francisco; from there they
arc forwarded to their destination by the first op-
portunity that offers.
Transit and sea postage is paid to the United
Statps Post Office on the correspondence so for-
warded, at the rate of twenty-five cents an ounce
for letters, and one penny each for newspapers.
But the amount paid on letters for Vancouver's
Island and British Columbia cannot be distin-
guished from that paid on letters for California.
The amount paid for the mail servicc to and
from Australia and New Zealand is i!94,000, or
§970,000 per annum, one half which is repaid to
the British Government by the several Australian
colonics.
The sea postage collected on letters sent to
Australia is retained by the Post Office in Eng-
land, and amounts to about <£29,000, or $145,000,
per annum.
The sea postage on letters from Australia to
Great Britain is collected and retained by the Aus-
tralian colonies.
It will be at once perceived, in this wonderful
chain of mail routes, how disproportionate the re-
ceipts are to the bonus paid by the British Gov-
ernment. With such an example set byourgrent
commercial rival, I trust that we will no longer
'bo insensible to the necessity of such action upon
our part as will secure for our people that com-
merce and trade by mail facilities which our nat-
ural position enables us to command. This over-
land mail system will be but the precursor to the
building of the Pacific railroad, and then follow-
ing close upon it we will have our steamships
controlling the commerce of Japan, China, Mex-
ico, and South America. Nothing but sectional
jealousy and blindness to the true destiny and
interest of our country will prevent the consum-
mation, in due time, of all these great results.

Mr. HALE. Mr. President 
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Bigi-eriii
the chair.) It is the duty of the Chair to announce
the special order for this hour, which is the bill
(H. R. No. 23) for the admission of Kansas into
the Union. That bill is now before the Senate.
Mr. HALE. I rise simply for the purpose of
proposing to make some disposition of this mat-
ter, and fixing some time at which it may be re-
sumed.
Mr. GWIN. Let us fix Saturday, and go
through with it then. To-morrow we are to have
an executive session, and next day is private bill
day. Let us fix this for Saturday.
Mr. HALE. If it is the pleasure of the Senate
to make this the special order of the day for Sat-
urday, it will suit roe.
Mr. GWIN. Fix Saturday, at half past eleven
o'clock.
Mr. HALE. I move that the farther consider-
ation of the overland mail bill be postponed until
half past eleven o'clock on Saturday, and be made
the special order of the day for that time.
Mr. DA VIS. Say twelve o 'clock, and give us
an opportunity to get through with the morning
business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will
suggest that that is not the business before the
Senate. _ _
Mr. HALE. By common consent it is. I will
say twelve o'clock on Saturday. •
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. I do notagree,
for one. • '
