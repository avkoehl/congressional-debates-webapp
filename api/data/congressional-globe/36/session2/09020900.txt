THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 14,
Such financial management as this would bank-
rupt any Government on the-face of the earth.
We have in the Postmaster General, at the head
of the Post Office Department, an officer who, ac-
cording to the state of our present laws, can plunge
this Government into debt almost at his pleasure.
He can increase the expenditure on a route; ho
can " order up "the service, as they call it. There
is scarcely any practical limit to his discretion as
to the amount in which he can involve this Gov-
ernment. He is not limited by the receipts from
postages; he is not limited even by the appropri-
ations in the, annual bills, but he increases this
expenditure at pleasure.- Now, sir, unless we
do something to restrain this discretion, unless
we do something to regulate this Department,
instead of adding thus immensely to the imposts,
as it is proposed to do in this bill, we shall never
succeed in rescuing the Treasury from its financial
embarrassments. I believe that something might
be done, that one great step might be achieved, if
we were to put out to contiact not only the trans-
portation, but the delivery of the mails. I believe
we could thus arrange a scheme which would not
only cut off a great and unwholesome source of
patronage from the Executive, but which would
add greatly to the cheapness and efficiency of the
Post Office service itself. But, sir, without refer-
ence to that which is theoretical, it is certain that
if the Post Office Department were managed as it
was managed up to the year 1851, and made a
self-sustaining Department, so as to relieve the
Treasury from these vast embarrassments, and if
the proceeds of the public lands were applied to
the payment of the public debt, if trade and com-
merce were to revive, the tariff as it now stands
would yield us an abundance for the just wants
of the Government.
But, Mr. President, suppose that in the present
condition of the finances of the country now, since
the debt has been increased, it was desirable to get
more money than the tariff of 1857 would give:
we could easily make additions which, on the im-
ports of the lust fiscal year, would giva us some-
thing like $6,000,000 more of revenue than we re-
ceived for that fiscal year; and that, too, without
interfering with the business of the country, with-
out imposing any burden which it would be griev-
ous to anybody to bear. J had a statement made
out at the Treasury Department, showing the
details of such an amendment of the present law.
Without reading the tables, I will state in general
terms, that if wc were to raise the 4 per cents to
10, the 8 pur cents to 10, the 12 per cents to 15,
and carry up the spices to 30, we should have got,
in that way, an increase of revenue for the last
fiscal year of a little over $2,000,000. The im-
portations of articles on the free list, exclusive of
specie, were about $72,000,000; and if we had laid
upon them a duty of 5 per cent., we should have
got something like #3,500,000 or $3,600,000; that
- is to say, the two together would have given us an
addition of nearly $0,000,000, and we should have
had, with these two additions, a revenue of nearly
$ GO ,000,000 the last fiscal year. I say these addi-
tions and changcs in the tai iffof1857, which would
not bear heavily on any one, would yield us, if any
tarirt could yield us, an abundance of revenue.
Why should we not, then, bo contented with
making small additions of that sort, which would
bring us in much more money, as I think I am
prepared to show, than the tariff which it is now
proposed to pass, and which would give us this
additional amount of money without embarrass-
ing any branch of trade, without impairing the
operation of any of the great divisions of our in-
dustry r We know, from statistics, that the oper-
ation of the tariff of 1857 upon the industry of the
country has been eminently beneficcnt. I have
turned to the various great branches of our indus-
try to see. I took the iron; and that is a matter
about which we hear most complaint. I com-
pared the imports and exports of iron and of iron
iriaEmfactures under the last three years of the
and tho tllree years tlle tariff of
li_o7. I he average annual import of iron and
lion manutactures for the last three years under
the tariff of 18-16 was $22,781,000, and for the
three years under the tariff of 1857, §10,060,800;
thus showing- that the imports had diminished
actually §6,000,000, or nearly one third. On the
other hand, the average annual export of iron and
iron manufactures for the last three years of the
tariff of 184C, was equal in value to $13,799,000,
or an average of §4,266,000. The average annual
export under the tariff of 1857 for three years
were $15,936,000, oi an average of $5,312,000;
thus sho wing an increase of one fourth in that re-
gard.* We see that the average yearly import,
under the last three years of the tariff of 1846, was
much greater than for the same number of years
under the tariff of 1857—thus showing a diminu-
tion of the importations under this tariff on the
one hand; and on the other, that for the same
period there was a large increase of the exporta-
tions of iron and manufactures of iron. YvHiat
does this prove ? It proves that a duty of 24 per
cent, is in factmore protective now than a duty of
30 per ccnt. was at the time the tariff of 1846 was
passed. It is more protective, becausc the differ-
ence between the relative cost of producing iron
here and in England at this time and then, is so
much less now than it was then; and the very
fact that the importations of iron have fallen off
under this reduction of duty to 24 per cent, shows
that, probably, to reach the revenue standard, in-
stead of increasing, you ought to diminish the
duties. If these facts do not prove this conclu-
sion positively, they go far to establish its prob-
ability. To show, too, the effect the present tariff
has had upon the general interests of the country,
we find that the yearly average exportations of
iron and manufactures of iron are increasing from
$4,000,000 up to $5,000,000 a year, increasing at
the rate of nearly 25 per cent.; and that in the
short space of three years.
How is it in regard to the general manufactures
of the country ? I have compared the last three
years of the tariff of 1846 and the three years of
the tariff of 1857 in regard to the exportations
of domestic manufactures. I find that the aver-
age exportations of domestic manufactures for the
last three years of the tariff of 1846—in 1855,185G,
1857—were §10,702,000. I find that for the last
three years of 1858, 1859, I860, the average was
$13,999,000, say §14,000,000, thus showing a
rapid increase of the exportations of domestic
manufactures under this tariff of 1857.f
Is not that evidence of the beneficence of its
operations ? Have we not evidence of it from the
assertion of all the newspapers? Are there any
petitions here from the manufacturers for an in-
crease of the tariff? Have we not seen, lately, that
the Massachusetts mills have resumed full work?
Is there any other interest in the country aspros-
perous ? Why, sir, I heard a shrewd man from
Massachusetts say two years ago that wherever
they had new machinery they were doing well;
and that those who were running old machinery
in Rhode Island, instead of altering their machine-
ry, were seeking to alter the tariff; and that if
they would introduce the new improvements, and
keep up with the progress of the age in manufac-
tures, they would not require an increase of the
tariff; and I say these statistics prove the fact, for
they show a general improvement and increase
and advance ill the manufacturing interest of the
country.
The difference between the tariff of 1857 and
that now proposed, so far as manufactures are
concerned, is this: the tariff of 1857 made the raw
material, to a great extent, free; it diminished the
expense of manufacturing, and, at the same time,
it reduced the duty on the textile fabric, thus
enabling the manufacturer to make a profit, and
* iron.

yet sell his product at a lower rate. That gave
him a larger circle of consumers and customers.
Thatplacedliim at issue and at war with nobody.
The customer was pleased, because he got the
article cheaper; the manufacturer was contented,
because, being enabled to produce cheaper, he
could furnish the article at a lower price, and thus
satisfy the consumer. This tariff now proposed,
while it increases the duty upon the raw material
of some species of raw wool and upon iron, en-
deavors to compensate it by laying duties almost
prohibitory upon the manufactured articles, so
that, in order to enable the manufacturer to make
a profit, the consumer must be forced to pay a
larger price; and thus the manufacturer, under this
tariff, will have a smaller circle of consumers, be-
cause there must be fewer who will consume at
high prices than at low, and he will find himself
at war with the consumer, and every other inter-
est, as long as this tariff remains on the statute-
book.
But, sir, allow me to proceed with a review of
the operations of this tariff upon the great inter-
ests of the country. 1 have shown you how it
acted upon manufacturers of iron. How is it
upon raw cotton? For the years 1855,1856, and
1857, the average exports of cotton—those were
the last three years of the tariff of 1846—were
$116,034,000, and the average price 10.26 cents.
For the years 1858, 1859, and 1860, the average
yearly exportation was $161,542,000, at an aver-
age price of 11.76 cents; thus showing a large in-
crease of the quantity exported, and of the price
which it brought.*5 Does this say nothing for the
tariff of 1857? I am looking now to the produc-
tion not only of the manufacturer, but to the in-
terest of him who produces the raw material.
How is as it to tobacco? Why, sir, I find that,
in the last three years of the tariff of 1846, the
average exportation of tobacco was §15,865,000.
In the years 1858,1859, and I860, the average ex-
portation of tobacco was $17,996,000; thus show-
ing a large increase in these items.f
Mr. President, if I had time—but I know I shall
be forced to weary the Senate more than I desire
to do, with every effort that I can make to con-
dense and compiess—I should like to go into a
review of the operations of this tariff on the for-
eign trade of the country. I would like to show
how it has been increasing our direct communi-
cation with Europe; how it is that, under its op-
eration, we havebeendecentializingourEuropean
commerce from Liverpool and England. Before
that, most of our French and continental goods,
with the exception of Bremen goods, which come
here directly in steamers, used to go through
England; but from the time the tariff of 1857 was
passed, and we reduced so largely the duties on
wme, brandies, cloths, and the continental prod-
ucts, our direct trade has been increasing. As
a consequence, our ships have gotten a larger
share of freights; as a consequence of it, our mer-
chants have had a larger share of profits upon
these exchanges; and we ourselves have been able
to consume upon cheaper terms. As another con-
sequence, we have not been forced to depend so
much upon a commercial center in Great Britain.
We have been building up one of our own; and
New York, but for these political troubles—and ..
if you will not crush it down with this monstrouM^
bill which is now proposed—may soon become^^^
the center and emporium of the world.
_ put, Mr. President, I have no time to enter now
into that field of inquiry. Whoever will look into
it will^find that, under the operation of this tariff
of 1857, an impulse has taken place in that direc-
tion, and we have been conductingour commerce
* cotton.
