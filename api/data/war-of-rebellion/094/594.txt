HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Eastport, Miss., January 15, 1865.

Major General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Mil. Div. of the Miss., Waterloo, Ala.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you detail a party of twenty men to escort a flag of truce to the rebel lines, and that they be crossed to the south bank of the river at this place. It is desirable to send an officer in charge of the flag who is shrewd, observant, and has a good eye for topography. You will detail this officer, and, when ready to start, direct him to report at these headquarter for his communications and instructions. The party should go prepared for a trip of several days' duration, say ten, as it will not be sent by way of Corinth, and might not be halted for several days on any other road upon which it may be sent.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
