HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 30, 1862. (Received 10.45 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The Fourteenth Connecticut Regiment has two field officers and one captain, who came from the First Connecticut Heavy Artillery, and are good artillery officers. I recommend that this regiment be assigned to duty as parts of the garrison, as they will soon learn the use of heavy guns. If it were placed for a short time with the First Connecticut it would soon be efficient. The Fourteenth is now, I think, near Chain Bridge.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I learn that there are 5,000 new troops at Forts Marcy and Allen besides two regiments and a battery from Sumner's. The last I have ordered to join their corps. Five thousand are more than required for the immediately defense of the two forts. A part could be used to advantage between Chain Bridge and Tennallytown, where the garrisons are entirely too weak. I leave one brigade of Sumner's there, but if you judge it unnecessary, they can follow their corps. I think we are particularly weak on north side and none too strong on south side. Have suspended the departure of the four regiments to Fort Monroe.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Have sent an aide to Alexandria to direct that all the available transportation be sent at once to Aquia, and that Burnside be informed by telegraph how much is sent and asked how much more he requires. Will inform you the moment I hear of Couch's arrival. Will do my best to push out ammunition and supplies. I learn from Fort Monroe that bad weather has sadly delayed the embarkation of cavalry.

A tow-boat broke loose last night from five schooners loaded with cavalry, and they were obliged to put back to Fort Monroe. I still hear the artillery firing.

Major-General McCLELLAN, Alexandria:

I think couch should land at Alexandria and be immediately pushed out to Pope. Send the troops where the fighting is. Let me know when Couch arrives, as I may have other information by that time. Use the Connecticut officers and regiment as you propose. Send transports to
