Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Deserters from Wallace's Ransom's and Gracie's brigades have just been examined. They report that orders have been issued for all surplus baggage to be sent to the rear or disposed of, hospitals to be struck, and sick sent away. A captain told one of his men that the men must be in very light order, so that they will not encumber the train. Batteries are moved away from their fronts, and light pieces placed in their stead. In one battery where there were five guns are small pieces now put in to replace them; this on Wallace's front. The tobacco and cotton were being moved to the depot of South Side Railroad.

Lieutenant DILLINGHAM,

Ninth Corps:

Deserters report the enemy sending their hospitals, surplus stuff, heavy guns, &amp;c., to the rear. Please instruct your stations to keep a sharp lookout for any indications of this, and to keep a night watch for what they may see or hear. Instruct the Walthall station to watch closely the Richmond railroad and the point on the Richmond pike bearing north 50 degrees west, seen that station.

CHAS. L. DAVIS,

Captain, &c.
