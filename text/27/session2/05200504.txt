CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ílTh& band west of us have also killed some of the stock of
Mr. Harvey, near the Ocklocknee "
A presentment of the grand jury of Madison county, re-
ceived by me since the message -was communicated, states
"The ciuirens of this county have suffered greater loss, and
been attacked moie frequently, by the Indians, within the last
month, than they evei have been since the commencement of
the war "
So far, then, fro n there having been any change which could
justify a chanse of policy, the same cause existed for the rejec
tion of Col Worth's suggestions, so far as a termination of hos
tilities was concerned, as at first
The scheme proposed, is said by the message to have been
corroborated by the Governor of the Territory, and by many
Of its mo=it intelligent citizens Who those citizens are, I have
no means of knowing Idonotclaim the quality of intelligence,
but I at least am one of the citizens of that Territory, who have
never sanctioned s ach a scheme, not been consulted upon a move
xnent so interesaos tothe people of the Territory Whether the
representation of Georgia, a State alsi interested m the subject,
baa been consulted, they can best answer But, so far as the
sanction of the Governor of Florida is concerned, I cannot but
believe that some mistake has occurred I have here, with me,
a. letter from Governor Calí, dated the 20th. of January, m
which he tells me sf the rumor oí Col Woith'a purpose, and
puts me urjon the alert The letter evidently hadreference to
the very same propositions which are contained in Col Worth's
letter of the 14th of Februaiy, and which is the basis of this
late move of the War Department X íequest that tha Clerk
will read the extract
' I am very apprehensive, from what I have heaid within the
last few days, that a roport will be made to the Government,
representing the war at an end, while there ate yet bands of In
(bans prowling in the country entirely unsubdued Should this
be the case, and the troops are withdrawn, the frontier settle
inents will be greatly exposed and the Governor of the Tern
tory has no means whatever to afford them protection You
may depend on it, (he war will nof be closed this wmter, and
should the army retire from Flouda, many of the advanced
settlements will be destroyed You will, perhaps, obtain early
intelligence ol the Intentions of the Government, and I am suie
you will use every eff>rt in your power to provide for the secu
rity of the frontier You will find me at all times ready to co
operate wi h you for the accomplishment of this or any othei
measure to promote the interest of Florida "
Now, then, I cannot suppose that the Governor would blow
hot and cold upon such a subject, and that while he invited me
to one position, he placed himseii, in his communications to the
War Department, upon another
These remarks, it will be observed have reference to the dec
laration that the war is ended, and the announcement of the
scheme of ceasing hostilities
I have said, sir, that this permission to Colonel Worth to de
Clare a cessation of hostilities was a virtual abandonment of the
"whole pulpase and fiuit of the Fonda war and of the policy
with which Us continuance had been maintained up to this
time The object which the Government proposed was the ie
movaloflhu Seminóles from Florid i Then lémoval was nof
only thepomtol honor, but, after hostilities mice commenced, it
became the point of safety and necessity When a cessation of
hostilities was proposed by the Indians ihemsclves in 183q, with
out a stipulation for their emigration, the reply was prompt
and decisive that the policy of removal could not be aban
doned That reply is to be found m the leiter of the War De
partment to General Jesup, dated July 25 1857 Doc 78,21
session, 25th Congress The Clerk will please to lead the ex
tract
"It is true that, m tha contest which ensued, they have dig
played, in an eminent degree, the savage virtues of consistency
and courage, and that, aided by the climate and nature of the
country, they have, so tar, successfully defended themselves
against superior force*, directed by biave and skilful officers
but the conduct ana courage of the enemy do not alter the in
ture of the war, nor dimmish oui obligations to subdue them,
and compel them to fulfil their engagements To abandon the
settled policy of the Government, because the Seminóles have
proved themselves to be good warrior , and rely lor the protec
tionof our fiontiersupon the faith of treaties with a people who
have given such repeated proof? of treachery, would be unwise
and impolitic We cannot desist from piosecutingthe war on-
til the Seminóles, consent to remove from riorida, without an
abandonment of theonlv measures whicn canpreseive the in
dependent uiá even existence of thp Imhan tribes, and mvi
tmg; the resistance of all those who now remain east of the Mis
sifiuippi To withdraw our forces now, would betray sieat
weakness, and not only tarnish the bono  ofoui arms, but vjo
late the sacted obligations of the Government of the Unite 1
8 ates to protect the persons and property of the citizens of
riondifrom the savage aggression of the Indiana i am per
suad il this obligation c m be fulfilled without seeking to extei
mínate the **emmoles and am grateful to find, that aftei hav
mg had time for further examination and reflection, you com
cidem this opinion "
Herí* then, wa*uhe deliberate announccm nt of the pm poses
of the Government And now without the consent or conceit
of thelnhan-* after ñve yeaism >io of expenditure and con tin

sequence of this st«p ? Why, sir, the peninsula of Honda
your most assailable and vulnerable point in the South will
remain inthe possession of an untamed, ferocious, and tri
umphant c-einy \ou aoandon the ¡strong ground ot the tieaty,
which requires theiremigration and if they choose to temaiu
quiet, you never can renew me tsures of force 'or their removal
Ij not tms <*n abandonment- of the whole fruits of your Ion "

aivdthe enemy fted Can any thing be m re ridiculous—more
er^ell No, sir,itis idle fo think of inducing set lement under
Such, circumstances This idea of a forced peice, of an armed

B^B6oiwultcd about it it would not have been so bad; but qyq i
then u would have been an unjustifiable arrangement llave
we not had evidences enough of the faithlessness of the Semi
noles  to have learned by this time moie wisdom? Ana yet
those who now remain are the most faithless, leckiess and
rascally of that vagabond race If there was any virtue among
them, thcat virtue has departed with those that have ermgiaie 1
The faithlessness of the Honda Indians is not of recent dis
covery Aj& fai back as 1609 their character was depicted by a
Portuguese traveller in terms of wonderful prec eion The ex
tract I read is m the quaint language of the tianslatur, and
furn sues a peifectpictuie of their race at*" presentday
"But, for all then faire and cunning speeches, they aie not
overmuch to T e trus ed, for they are (he greatest traitors of the
world, as their manifold, most erartie, continued and blooJy
tieasons heteset downat large, doe evidently prove They be
also as imonstant as the weathercock, and most readie
to take all occasions of advantages to doe rmschiefe They
are great liar* and drssemblers, for which faults oftentimes
they had their desei ved paiments And many times they gave
good testimonleof their great valour and resolution So handle
them gently, while gentle courses maybe found to serve, it will
be, without comparison, the best but if gentle polishng will
not serve then we shall not want hammeiours and rough ma
songeHow,Imeaneour oldsoldiours tiamed up in the INethei
lands, to square and prepare them to our preacheis' hands "
Ihesame character was given them m 1323 m an of he lJ
commun nation to Congre&s, and the same character has been
found in the history of this war to be still impressed upon
them How, then can you expect to ie tain them within the
same limit-* with the white man in peace?
But if they íefrainfoi the present fiom aggression, they will
remain thcte as a&anctuary and refuge to the fugitive p aves
of the Suitb, until, bythe increase of numbers, and the aid
they will receive from the British islands nei^hhonng to the
peninsula, you will have a band of maroons more teinble and
dangerous than the Semino'es have ever been

Mr C no such declaration in the me& aee Tbere was no uar
in Florida ÜNo legal war had ever existed in that Territory
I In all the acts of Congress on the subject, and all the documents
¿J  of the Government and its departments, the declaration that u
was a war that was going on m Florida had been carefully
avoided It nad been con tantly spoken of as "hostilities " It
was not a legal war, norwab it proposed to declaie that any
war had ended He (Mr C) entered his piotcst against such a
teim being a^phul toit 1¡ it wert, =0, what woul1 be the state
of ¡acts? The United States, an enlightened nation of 17,000,000
mhab tants, declann? w tr against 8d Indian ' 1 here were but
80 ccording to ,[ie officidl document , and 120 or 130, according
to ths gentleman fi >m Florida [Mr Levy ] Thus, there would
be a war between 17,(J00 000 of people anil 80 poor fuemve In-
dians f He (Mr ^ ) disdained to call it war It was not a war.
It was what the President had called it, and it had always been
called—'hostilities "
Mr LEVY sa1(i he ohjer'eá to the message of the President,
because it declaied that hostilities ha I ended He had not said
war It was however once te\m°d officially a war by the At-
torney General, upon the application r í General Jesup m 1837.
He (Mi L ) had not looked upon it otherwise than as a rebel-
lion
Mr GUSHING wa*> understood to remark that he heard the
gentleman frequei tly use the term war in the course oí his re-
marks He (Mr G )couilfeeero hinss objectionable m the decla-
ration that hostthUes had *-t. ased when no war had been declared-
Wha^ htn was tleo jeciion to the message of the President?
Hal * recommendtd that the Government snould cease to af*
feid its protection to thn peo} Je ot l onda? This was the
only piac ical question that could be biojght mtodiscussion.
It was immaterial whethei the House concurred or not with the
President m the opinion he had expressed The only practical
question was, what should be dore in Florida"* He repeated,
that, according to the testimony on file m the department, there
werebu eighty Indians lemaimng in Flonda Hid the gentle'
man [Mr Levy] wish thiee or fom regiments oí the army to be
emplojedagaiiibttrose few Indians'? Did he wi*h them to be em-
ployed so long as a smg t Indi in remained in F onda? That
w<ib his proposition, and he protested that ho^tiiifies should not
be cot «ideted as having ceased whi «t there was a single Indian
remaining m tt e Ten itory Had the President proposed that
there shoi Id be no more military niotectson to the people of
riorida? He proposed, in the first place, that hostilities should
cea^e, unlets agTes^ions si ould be madefy tlielndians, see-
on'ly, that r egotiations should be entere 1 into for a voluntary
suuenderof all the Ina ans, and thinly, that the inhabitants
should be prutecttd by the armed oct npation of the Territory,,
What furil ei than this did tte gentleman from Tlonda [Mr
Levy] piopose? Two regiments were to be kept there He
(>li C ) U101 ght them enoush, lOietber with the people of the
Territory, to afTbul ample protection dgamst eighty Indians.
"No fdJÍt could bt found with the fo ce to be employed The
reg ments Aould be theie as armed setters—(he Government
fuimshii g inland prpMsions Was it not notorious that for
yeaisit bid been argbcd n the Sena'e that the lest, safest,
mo t economical, and in fact, the only method to terminate the
Floti a w-ir, was by an armed occupation-oí the Territory?
Mi LEVY explained He had &a¡d that tne propositionscon-
tamed in the Pres deo's message weie communicated to the
House, by the Secie ary of War at least twenty áays before the
Pie&i Lilt's mecsage wasiecuvf ! an i that, therefore, so far as
If"! 1 ition w is cot cemed the ircssase was uncalled for This
hem the ci-se The President could have no other object in view,
thin that oí announc ngtbt termination of the wai
Mr CU-'IIIN'G sud the P evident di Í not announce the ter-
mn atlon of the war, but his message contained a specific rec-
ommendation of mil taiy protection tithe people of Florida
Then aeco dingtotbeexplanat'onof thegemlemaii from Flon-

aid contamea what had aheady been communicated tothe
House 1 he gen leman had not said that two regiments were m-
pufficKntto 1 rotea the ptop e noi it uthearmedoccupation of
the fern tory was improper all that he complained of
was, the eclaiation of the Piesident that hostilities had
eea=eJ If it weie now «n 1 sue before the House whether the
new system of operations proposed was proper, he (Mr U )
ftou d join issue upon it He believed it was time that the
parade, the marching and countei marching of troops, the
pro ecution of a system of opeiationsat anenoimous expense
to the Treasury, should cease—provided a=t he believed was
the fact, there were othei means of protection The practical
que«ti<mwas what is the best mode of terminating the difficul-
ties o^irducmg the Indians to suirender—making them emi-
grate by foice or otherwise? He would not sro into the ques-
tion whethei the people of riorida wished hostui íes tocontinue,
or not, but he believed that pacific means were now required by
the hoitor of the com try, is well as the condition of its Treasu
ry, no only as oesf for the people of the United States, but also
for the people of riorida
Mr COOPrit of Gcoigia af er a few remaiks, observed that
