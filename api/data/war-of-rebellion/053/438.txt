CAMERON'S HILL, October 17, 1863-6.10 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

Rebel camp-fires extend from east to a point 25 degrees east of south in one unbroken line, being most numerous east-southeast and southeast, at which two points there are more troops than at last report. Should think there were two brigades additional at the point southeast.
