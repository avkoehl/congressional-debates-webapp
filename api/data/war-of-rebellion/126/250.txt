the fiscal year 1864, the accounts for

disbursement of which had not been

received at this office..................$31,317,806.00

A large portion of this, although

remitted during the fiscal year,

could not have been received before

its termination and could not,

therefore, be accounted for during

that fiscal year; the grater portion

had doubtless been accounted for direct

to the proper accounting officer of the

Treasury Department, as required by the

act of Congress approved July 17, 1862.....44,311,512.88

made to officers for disbursements

during the fiscal year 1864, not

taken up in the accounts received

The greater portion of this had

probably been accounted for direct

to the proper accounting officers

of the Treasury Department, as

required by the act of Congress

before referred to. The remainder

was distributed among the officers

disbursing at the various posts and

stations and in the field, and was

Easton, who had accompanied the army in its march from Chattanooga to Savannah, remained on the coast, taking charge of the fleet loaded with supplies. The fleet and supplies were transferred to the harbor of Beaufort. Fort Fisher fell in January and the Cape Fear River was opened to our transports. The troops which had captured, with the aid of the navy, the defenses at the mouth of this river, re-enforced by the Twenty-third Army Corps, which in January was transferred from the Tennessee to the Atlantic, captured Wilmington and advanced toward Goldsborough. The two railroad, each ninety-five miles in length, from Wilmington and from Morehead City to Goldsborough, were repaired by the Construction Corps. They were stocked with cars and engines, and when the Right Wing of General Sherman's army entered Goldsborough on the 22nd of March it met supplies of provisions brought by the railroads from the transport fleet on the cost, and found Goldsborough occupied by a corps which on the 15th of January had been encamped on the banks of the Tennessee.

Again was the army supplied with full equipment of clothing, shoes, and of all the various articles of necessity for itself and its trains, worn out it long march from Savannah, and by the 10th of April, the appointed day, fully equipped, it moved against the enemy at Raleigh.
