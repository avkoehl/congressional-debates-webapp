HEADQUARTERS,Mrs. McDaniel's, July 12, 1864-2 p. m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Major Barney, of Washington City, just from the front, brings a report from the officer commanding the cavalry on the Baltimore pike that he had been driven in, and that the enemy are in force two miles this side of Beltsville making for railroad. I learned unofficially that General Meigs is in command of the line in my front. I ought to know whom I may have to support, and everything calculated to aid defense by mutual action and co-operation. The sailors and employes mentioned in your dispatch of this a. m. have not reported yet, nor any more of the Nineteenth Corps. I want 50 axes and 100 shovels.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

MRS. McDANIEL'S, July 12, 1864-4. 05 p. m.

Major-General AUGUR:

The enemy are just beyond Bladensburg. Fugitive citizens are coming in. I have carefully examined the line of works from Fort Bunker hill to Fort Lincoln. More troops should be on this part of the line. I saw eight brass field pieces in Fort Lincoln not in use. They ought to be put in position, I think, with men to man them. I am not in command of the line in my front by any orders from you or any one else.

Respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The assignment of Captain Lodor to the command of Fort Lincoln meets my approval. He has just reported to me. Everything is quiet on my front. I think the enemy have fallen back a short distance from the position they had in front of Bladensburg. I do not believe there was any infantry there.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
