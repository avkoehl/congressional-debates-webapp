left of General Hinks' position was from the fact that after my interview with him he had advanced and in the darkness it was difficult to communicate.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General of Volunteers.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 6, 1864.

The order of 9.15 a. m. was sent, but I judge it failed to reach by signal telegraph. Colonel Morgan went over in a steamer, but it got aground, which was the cause of a half hour's delay, as he carried a verbal order to march and was to conduct the column.

CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, June 13, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,Richmond:

SIR: A dispatch just received from Major-General Hampton states that he defeated the enemy's cavalry near Trevilian, with heavy loss, capturing 500 prisoners, besides the wounded. The enemy retreated in confusion, apparently by the route he came, leaving his dead and wounded on the field. At daylight this morning it was discovered that the army of General Grant had left our front. Our skirmishers were advanced between on e and two miles, but failing to discover the enemy were withdrawn, and the army was moved to conform to the route taken by him. He advanced a body of cavalry and some infantry from Long Bridge to Riddell's Shop, which were driven back this evening nearly two miles, after some sharp skirmishing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
