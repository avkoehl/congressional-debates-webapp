a regiment should be withdrawn. General Wright is strongly of that opinion. If absolutely necessary I can send Russell's brigade, which has suffered the least.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

My breast heights are nearly up, except in some places where the men cannot work without drawing too much fire. I think I can dispense with Morris' and Upton's brigades. I do not think it would be safe to reduce more. Captain Michler has just been through the lines. Will soon send a sketch.

CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, SIXTH CORPS,

May 6, 1864-11 a.m.

Brigade commanders will throw up works for the position of their first lines, making any slight changes in the position of the lines that my be necessary to secure proper ground. Tools will be brought up on the road in rear of these headquarters, where they can be obtained by the working parties. Details of working parties will be made so as not to weaken the front line, which will be always held in readiness to repel an attack. Probably most readily constructed will be breast-works of timber. Captain Michler, Engineers, has. The pioneers will be employed on the work, forming a part of the working parties.

By command of Brigadier-General Wright:

Lieutenant-Colonel GRANT:

Burnside has gained 1 1/2 miles to his left to connect with Wadsworth, and now moves at once toward Hancock's firing, with Potter's division deployed, supported by a brigade. I should think Hancock's firing a mile away.

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.
