be brought by details, under guard, to my office, and the articles there distributed under the joint supervision of Captain Whytock and myself.

The business completed, I would at the proper time and place return him through the lines. If desirable, the affair could be further fortified by requiring him to take a parole of honor. I have conversed with Colonel Jones, commanding post, and he has no objection to Captain Whytock being brought here, as I have suggested. Please answer this by telegraphic dispatch to Major James R. Curell, agent of exchange at Mobile, Ala.

I shall leave here to-day for Mobile, Ala., to receive and forward the supplies to Cahaba and Meridian, and your decision would reach me at Major Curell's office.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. A. M. HENDERSON,

Captain and Agent.
