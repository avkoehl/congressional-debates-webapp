CITY POINT, VA., July 27, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

If you can possibly spare any troops from Bermuda for to-morrow's operations send them to General Hancock. Any that you can send should commence crossing as soon after daylight as they can.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JULY 27, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I will order Foster to make as vigorous a demonstration as possible on the right of the enemy from Ruffin's house, which he now holds, to employ all day at least as many of them as will equal his numbers. I take leave to suggest that a division, moving with celerity as far at the left as possible, says on or near the Weldon road and toward Petersburg, if the enemy has weakened his left to send troops to the James, might at least effect a diversion and perhaps achieve an advantage.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

JULY 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I will order Brigadier-General Birge with his brigade, of the Nineteenth Corps, 2,900 strong, to report to Hancock, crossing the bridge at daylight. I do not know how to spare them in case of attack, but I do not hope for any attack on our lines.
