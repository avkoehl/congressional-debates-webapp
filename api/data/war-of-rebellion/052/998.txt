Major-General PALMER,

Commanding Second Division:

SIR: Your dispatches of 7.05 a.m. and 1.45 and 4.20 p.m. are received.* The general commanding directs me to say that he is waiting for further orders from the general commanding department; that he may not get any, but that you will proceed in the morning on your original order, unless you receive counter orders. Unless some change occurs during the night, the general will leave here to join you early in the morning. I send you copy of the latest dispatch from Colonel Wilder. The general hopes that he has, are this, communicated with you. If not, some effort should be made at once to do so, as also with General Hazen. We have heard nothing from General Hazen since his dispatch to you. Of course this order to continue on embraces the three divisions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Write to the general on receipt of this, if Wilder has reported.
