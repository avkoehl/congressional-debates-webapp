and Opelousas road. I posted from this command infantry pickets at the different bayou crossings, both in their front and rear. The cavalry picket-line remained unchanged through the day, although 2 miles on our right of the junction there had been light skirmishing in its immediate vicinity between 200 of our cavalry and a small force of the enemy. It being late in the night when I left the vicinity of the line of the Opelousas road, I was not able to visit all the posts between the road and the river below the town.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
