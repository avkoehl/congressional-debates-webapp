the opinions ot Mr Gallatm and Mr Dalias ¡ and
in furthei illustiation of my own views,, allow me
to advert for a moment to the period at which these
opinions were entertaired and expressed, and take
a brief review of the circumstances m which the
countrv was p'aced at the time tins measure was
opposed by these gentlemen Did you then want
tempoiaiy means only' No, sir the war was fast
d'awmg to a close, leaving us involved in a debt
of many millions oí dollars beyond our existing or
immediately piospective resources to pay, and with
all the talents and energy of preceding Adminis-
trations, has nevei been discharged till within the
last fom }ears But because it was then detraed
nexpedient by Mi Dallas to issue Treasury notes,
doe^ it necessarily follow that it is never proper to
do so1 That would seem to be the argument
Wny, to have issued them then would indeed h tve
been as has been remaiked by my colleague, [Mr
Mason,] borrowing from hand tohano. lie, how-
ever, is of opinion that, if we have to bonow,
we should nev^r borrow like "mendicants,''but
do it like men of capital and credit, taking a good
lound '•um, and holding on to it for a good long
times and I think he gave ns some account of
what should in like circumstances be done by us
in private lite Sn, illustrations diawn iiom pri-
vate life, often afford us principles ana guides lor
public policv, and let me ask, what should we think
of a man who wanted a thousand dolíais for six
months, and should go on my colleague's scale of a
man oí credit and fortune, to borrow double that
amount for an indefinite period, when he hid no
eaithly «so for it lot 0ei than lor six monthsl I
doubt if any of us who consider ouiselves prudent
men wouldcver act upon th?t principle in ourown
case II re the amount will only be required tor
six, ant, 01 twelve months at iailhest, and ve
aie told that the only mode in which this should be
done is to act "above board," and borrow the mo-
ney for six years or a longer period, almost as
many ycais as we need it months, so that we may
have the giatifjing leflecuon of keeping in mind
that we have got the interest to pay on it for years
af er we hive no possible need of the principal,
and when it has even become a burden upon our
hands'
My lolleague [Mr Mason] ure s another objec-
tion to this bill, on the ground of expense It
is saul that it will be more expensive man the nego-
tiation of a loin How does he make that out'
Why he undertakes to show that the appropriation
made m the bill of the last session for the purchase
of phtes and the hire of clerks is more than would
be required to effect a loan I suppose the most ex-
pensive item, that of engraving the plates, need not
be incurred again, for the old ones will answer the
put pose, and the remaining expense will be the hire
ol four cleiks But if a loan be adopted, suppose
it should then turn out that the money cannot be
obtained and we have very recently heard deep
lamentations to that effect from almost every qnar-
tei I say, suppose u shall turn oat that we sha'l
not be able to procure, in this country, ten mil-
lions of dollars in specie, or its equivalent, what
then1! Why, we shall have to send a ícsponiible
«■gent to England, or to the continent of Europe, to
negotiate a loan I know not what such a gentle-
man's services would be worth m our Government,
for among our plain Republican people we know
very little about these matters, hut I apprchend the
Bank of the United States could give lissom" infor-
mation on *ho subj ct, as that has occasionally sent
persons to foreign countries on such business, but
what is the rate of compensation foi such service I
have no Knowledge, though I should think a good
round lumping fat fee If then this account be
balanced on the score of economy alone, it will, I
think, be found decidedly m favo" of the measure
proposed by the bill now under consideration
An honorable gentleman from Pennsy lvama [Mr
Sergeant] objects to this hill, on the ground that it
proposes another issue of continental paper money,
and to sustain that objection, a fac simue of the ac-
counts of that great and good man [General Wash-
ington, ] whese memory still lives in the grateful
recollection of a grateful people, has been exhibited
before us, with a view to present not only a sample
of what was then ¿«nominated money, bat also to
show the point to which it was depreciated, being
five hundred for one. This continental money the
honorable member compares with the Treasury
notes proposed to be issued by this bill, and at last
brings his ow n mind to the conclusion that the
continental paper is best, for the reason, among
others, that they had a latin motto stamped upon
them' That látm motto is exitw m dvbw; in plain
English, ihat the issue of the contest m which we
were then engaged was doubtful, and consequently,
that the redemption of this continental paper money
was also doubtful Then, sir, how do they
compare with Treasuiy notesl The gentle-
man has shown that csntinental paper was, at
the tune just referred to, at a deprec ation
of five hundied to one, his Latin motto shows that
their redemption was doubtful, and we all know
that, in the hands of the present holders, they aie
not worth the paper on which they ara written
And how is it with Tieasnry notes issued under a
bill identical both m principle and details «ith the
one now under consideration? We have the cheer-
ing intelligence, received by this morning's mail,
that in the cities of New York and Philadelphia
they are at par with specie; while in the South and
Southwest they aie at a premium of from one to
two pel cent above specie And how many gen-
tlemen are tneie now sitting atound ine (1 mean
not, of course, to include the honorable member
iiom Pennsylvania) who have their pockets pretty
well lined with these much abused Treasury notes,
and which have been received by them (all theif
abuse of them to the contrary notwithstanding) in
prelerence to gold and silver1 Nay, mote an hono-
rable gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr Ctjsn-
ivo] has stated the lact, that the notes which boie
an mtetest of one mill to the dollar aie at the same
pine in the Northern cities with those that bear six
percent interest Not a very intons'derab'e item
to be set off against the aigument of my colleague
[Mr Mason] on the score of expense, or unsatis-
factory to those who have emptied the vials of
iheir wrath upon the measure, because they say
that those «no receive notes at an interest of one
mill to the dollar, get less for the same demand up-^
on the Government than those who receive them at
a higher late of interest
But, sir, is the aigument of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania sound? I hold, that in a sound state
of the cufency, Tieasury notes shoilld never de-
preciate while the amount authorized is below the
amount of revenue intended for their redemption,
in other words, if they be based either upon reve-
nue or upon a specific tax for their redemption,
there will be no depreciation. We are informed
by Mr Jefferson, in his correspondence, vol 4,
page 1()9, that in the year 1755, the State of Vir-
ginia issued paper money, bottomed on a specific
tax fonts retlemptton, and to increase its credit,
bearing an interest or five per cent and that, in a
very short time, not a bill of this emission was to
be found in circulation, that they were locked up
in the chests of executors, guardians, widows, far-
mers, &c. That Virginia then issued bills bottom
ed on a redeeming tax, but bearing no interest
these, he mtoims us, were readily received, and ne-
ver depreciated a single fai thing
Now, sir, what was the character of the continen-
tal money which the gentleman from Pennsylvania
has compared with, and pronounced better than,
the Treasury notes proposed to be issued by this
bill? In the revolutionaiy war the old Congress,
and the States, issued biUs without interest, w ithout
tax, and without revenue to redeem them They
occupied the channels of circulation freely, till
those channels were overflowed by an excess be-
yond all the calls of circulation—the amount in
1781 being- $357,476,541—and having been issued
without tax, and without revenue to redeem them,
they continued to depreciate, until they beeame
worthless in the hands of their holders. B it let us
extend the comparison a little further, and inquire
when it was that the continental money, of which
the honorable member speaks, was issued? Sir, it
was during the war of the Revolution, when the
Government possessed neither money, nor credit,
at a time when no man could look forward to any
probable period when the Government would be
able to redeem its obligations.    But how is it with
us now? I have attempted to give some account
of your Treasury; and even those gentlemen who
represent its condition much worse than many here
know it to be, tell us we have nothing to do but
to set on foot a loan, and that ten millions of dol-
lars can be raised m the course of a few days'
pretty conclusive evidence, I take it, of the high
credit of the Government. Bat how stood foe
credit of the Government at the time to which the
honorable member refers of continental paper mo-
ney memory? it was literally without money and
without credit. Still the gentleman miists that the
comparison is good1 Tne reasoning may be con
elusive with the honorable member who urges it,
but I must say it does not cany conviction to my
mind
But there is still another objection urged against
the passage of this bill, and it is not the 'ess singu-
lar, considering the quarter from which it comes
Failing in aigument, gentlemen have conjured up
"hydras and chumeras dire," as if to frighten and
alarm the good people of this land Thev insist
that the issue of these Treasury notes looks so much
like a bank, that they cannot, for a moment, endure
the thought of seeing one Sir, in my anxiety to
avoid splitting upon such a rock, I began to cast
around me and see who were those so terrified and
alarm&l at the idea of a bank that they Could not
even hear its name mentioned without being horror
struck' Who are they? Why the very men who
are, to use a homely but expressive phrase, "up to
the hub" for a bank, one that can control and re-
gulate all the other banks m the country, and upon
a scale which may God in his mercy long avert,
Sir, 1 am myself, m good faith, so utterly opposed
to this Government's chartering a bank, that I can-
not contemplate its establishment without real dread
and alarm, aad, ll I could bring myself to believe
that, in the issuing ot Tieasury notes, we were ap-
proximating to -.uch an institution, I would avoid it
as I would "war, pestilence and famine " But,
before we give mío the opinion that it is a bank,
let us satisfy ourselves what the functions of a bank
are its principal funeuons are, under an act
of incorporation, to issue money, receive de-
posites, discount notes and bills of exchange,
and make dividends among its stockholders.
But what are the features of this pretended bank?
No act of incorporation, no power to issue any
thing other than the obligations of the Government
to pay its honest debts; no power to loan money, or
to receive money on deposite, nopowerto discount
notes, no power to deal m exchanges, ir a word,
no one feature of a bank whatever, but you simply
confer upon the Government the power to perform
an act of common honesty when it is unable to
pay its debts at sight, by giving its creditor a sim-
ple evidence of his debt. I had almost forgotten
another feature that was lacking in this bill to
make it a bank, Mr. Speaker, m has no powei to buy
ot speculate m cotton, no authority, undei cover of
its corporate powers, to enter into the market and
compete with the honest industry of the people, un-
der legal enactments and legal protections, devised
by itself it has none of these alarming traits about it
Mr Speaker, I had intended but for a moment to
have detained the House with a few remarks on
the constitutional question involved m this measure,
but the argument on that branch of ths subject has
been presented so clearly, so forcibly, and so con-
clusively by my friend from South Carolina, [Mr.
RuFTr,] that he has left nothing to be added
I have, however, sir, one other branch of the
subject to touch upon, and hut one, and that is to
examine the scheme which these gentlemen them-
selves recommended in p'ace of that proposed by
the bill under consideration What is their scheme*
A loan for four years we are told [Mr Robert-
son, in an under tone No time was mentioned, but
it was to be at the pleasuie of the Government ]
Well, sir, redeemable then at the pleasure of the
Government, I suppose, for there have been so
many propositions offered, that I have been unable
to keep pace with them I am now informed by my
colleague that the loan he proposed is to be redeema-
ble at the pleasure of the Government 1 would
thank my colleague to tell me who it is that
would lend money on such terms? Where will he
find capitalists in this country, or on the other side
