HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK, April 15, 1862.

Colonel McCALLUM,Manassas Junction:

The order concerning the rebuilding of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad is so far modified that you will rebuild so much of it as will make the connection with the Warrenton Branch road. For this purpose you are authorized and directed by the Secretary of War to call on Brigadier-General Abercrombie, at Warrenton Junction, for as many men as may be necessary to accomplish this in the shortest possible time and will draw off the least number of your regular railroad builders from the work to be done on the Manassas Gap road. Let some competent person superintend this work.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, April 15, 1862-4 p. M.

(Received 9 p. M.)

Hon. EDWIM M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Nothing has occurred since my dispatch of this morning to disturb the quiet then represented. The fine weather is very favorable to the operations at Yorktown, and it is probable that General McClellan will soon be able to open his batteries on the fortifications of the enemy. The French minister honored me with a visit this morning. He has gone to Norfolk, and will go to Richmond. On his return he will dine with me. On entering the fort I gave him a salute of thirteen guns. I have not heard from Franklin's division.

JNO. E. WOOL,

Major-General.
