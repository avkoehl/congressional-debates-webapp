MAY 9, 1862-4 a.m.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Commanding Forces:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Failing in my hopes of dining with General Pope to-day, as he seems to decline our company, I suggest a point for your consideration. My scouts, who captured the prisoner in rear of the enemy yesterday, report the trains of Pope's command moving in both directions between Hamburg and this side of Chambers Creek, and without escort. Roddey suggests that his men can lead a cavalry force of several hundred men in there by a route entirely south of Pope's command; seize their trains; turn them south across Chambers Creek; burn the bridge, and bring them off. If there was not time for this, fire would do the work. Wirt Adams, with some addition, would do the work.

Yours, truly,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, &amp;c.,

P. S.- I send you my map and will try to supply its place.*

Major General EARL VAN DORN,

Farmington Road, Miss.:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I have sent orders immediately to hold troops in readiness, considering it as well to develop the enemy; but these

orders harass our troops, and commanders should be careful how they report, and be sure of their correctness.

Yours, truly,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

P. S.-

CORINTH MISS.,

May 9, 18620-5.30 a.m.

The movement of this morning, suspended on your dispatch of the enemy falling back, will be resumed as soon as my troops can be ready- say 7 a.m. By 8.30 or 9 o'clock we ought to be well on to Farmington, and you can correspond. I send you two good guides to show the route by Potts' across Seven Mile Creek to Utley's, so as to get to the enemy's rear if he be not too strong. Of this we will judge after feeling him.

Yours, &c.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

Approved.

G. T. B.

MAY 9, 1862-(Received 8 a.m.)

General BEAUREGARD:

The enemy's pickets are in front of Farmington. Smokes are seen beyond. I shall move toward the right, as agreed upon.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
