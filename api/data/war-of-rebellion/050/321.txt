with the enemy on the 19th and 20th instant, on Chickamauga Creek, Ga., a few miles south of this place:

On the morning of the 19th instant, after marching all of the night before, the battalion took position on the right of Battery H, Fifth U. S. Artillery. At 10 a. m., by the order of the brigade commander, I marched to the front and joined the First Battalion of the Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, then already engaged. Shortly after doing so, the command was attacked in rear by an overwhelming force of the enemy and compelled to retire to the crest of a adjoining hill, from which position the enemy were repulsed.

The battalion bivouacked with the brigade, 1 mile from the field.

Early on the morning of the 20th instant, line was formed on the east side of the Chattanooga road. At 9 a. m. a severe attack was made upon this position. My command was ordered to the support on the First Battalion, Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, and at once became warmly engaged. The troops on my left soon gave way, and, my position being flanked and the command being exposed to an enfilading fire, I fell back to the timber in the rear, and there continued engaged until the enemy was repulsed. I afterward, in connection with Captain Smith, commanding the First Battalion, Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, assisted in driving the enemy from the open fields on the left.

The command being much reduced in numbers, I took position in the breastworks, near the place of our formation in the morning.

About 5 p. m. a severe attack was again made upon this part of the line, I remained until ordered to fall back, suffering considerable loss in the movement. I then, by order of the general commanding brigade, marched to Rossville, and remained in position near that place until the morning of the 22nd instant, when the command marched to this place.
