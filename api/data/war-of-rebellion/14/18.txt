
SEMINARY, VA., March 19, 1862-11.55 a. m.

General WOOL:

The First Division of Heintzelman's corps left here yesterday about 1 p. m. in steamers for Fort Monroe. It is important that they should be disembarked as rapidly as possible, that steamers may at once return for other troops. General Barnard goes down to-day. Cannot a boat run to telegraph station every hour or so?

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

SEMINARY, March 19, 1862-11.20 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I think we have now well systematized the arrangements for embarkation. The troops in splendid spirits. Please have an immediate decision upon the letter which will reach you to-morrow morning in regard to co-operation of the Navy.* That matter is very important. There will be a review of two divisions of First Corps here to-morrow at 2 p. m.

All goes well.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

MARCH 19, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Alexandria:

In order to determine the precise co-operation you want with the Navy the President will go immediately to alexandria, and desires you to meet him at the wharf.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of war.

SEMINARY, March 19, 1862-12 m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The transfer of the large force under way and under orders for the Peninsula between James and York rivers at and above Rivers at and above Fort Monroe will render a available for active offensive operations the greater part of the troops now under command of Brevet Major-General Wool, who have hitherto been on the defensive. We cannot dispense with this force, and to render it available I have to request that such orders may issue as shall place it at my disposal and shall enable me now to have it formed into division, under the command of Brigadier-General Mansfield.

In this connection I beg to submit that, being the senior major-general commanding the Army whenever the forces now under my immediate command come in contact with those of other generals I should have command of the whole.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
