sense alone, and he should vote for the amendment, but not in
the spirit which had been imputed to him
Mr PRHSTOV respectfully asked the gentleman to withdraw
his amendment. The fact was that it did not meet the purpose
of the resolution The only question was with regard to the
word "slaves," and if the Constitution was to be adhered to,
tpsissi/na verba, the amendment should read "persons held t 
labor " Bit even th s would not make the point for the South,
jfit shou d be made at all, let the word be "slaves " This was
n^ces^ary at the present time, judging from the resolutions
which hai this mosnng been laid upon their tab'e fot in one of
them, m speaking of a revolt of the slaves, it was observed that
those fro "n whern these resolutions emanated woula not feel
hound to aid m extmgu =shing the sacred fire, but in the woids
of Leggett, pray lktiat the victory of the battle might go with
the oppressed " He called the earnest attention of Senators to
This^nhjpct, especially as their Uvea were threatened by infernal
fanaticism
Mr. JUNG requested the Senator to real the fhs' resolu
tion.
Mr PRESTON did so, and it was to the effect that the slaves
ori board of the Cieole acted in accordance witn the deci&mn of
tbe Supreme Court in the case of the Anm ad, a id proved
themselves worthy of their fteedom, and trusted that their ex
ample would be imitated under simnar circumstances He
hopM that the toenatoi from Michigan would not persist in his
amendment
Mi PORTER observed that the Senator fram South Caro
Una had called his attention lo the tesolution, which he had
never seen before The fcenator objected to the term ' per
son , ' because there weie ftpe peis^ns as well as slaves on
board of toe Creole, and a murder had there been committed
Now, they only knew, from the newspaper, that a murder
had been committed but might it not have been co nmitted by
persons otner than slaves?
Mr PRL^roN remarked that they contended fortherecla
mation of the slav es
Mr RIVE^ gave dup credit to the Senator fiora Michigan,
as he hdd disclaimed any sinister design in proposing his amend
ment He thought, however, that the Senator had mduged in
a need'ess degree of fastidiousness as to the term applicable to
the subject in controversy The Senator would admit mat sla

did he not s^e the beaimg of hs own remarfc&í The
Bnti3h Government was exceedingly fastidious on the
issue is to calling saves persons, and in all us

motive had not been fan'y appreciated He was aware that
the term' falaves" h dbeen used n common parlance, but his
objection to us us 1 here was, tha^it was an unnecessary word
m the languige of legislation, ind, in sug^e-tmg the amendment,
he ha<l had no other object m view but a conformity with the
Constitution He had expiessed no opinion, but had merely
vindicated his course His  motive was to íecegnise that ''ort of
decoium which belonged to theit deliberations, and which was
sat clioneú! by the Constitution The term "slaves" wis not
known to the federal Government, and he thought that it was
very pioper to avoid the expression
Mr C&AHAM remark, d that, since the discussion had
been going on, he had looked at nine or ten laws on the sub
ject, and almost eveiy one of them recoguibei the teim
slaves
Mi WOODBRIDGE took the opportunity to add his own
request, that his colleague would withdraw the amendment, es
peciaily as the term m toe re olution confirmed nothing and
concluded no hing
Mr PORTER said that he had no wish to stand single and
alone on ihi& bubject He could not, however, withdiaw his
a nendaient, except by tne unanimous consent of the feenate
It this should be given, he would have no hesitation in do

with which the report ol the Sectary had been prepaied It
was but justice tj say that it was grawn up with extraordinary
ability—with as much, if not moie, ability, than any document
which had emanated hom any Secretary of that Depaitment,
and this was no oidinary conpiiment, considering those who
had pieceded the present ¡secretary It was the woi k of a ma

of tlidt report knuvung the purity of his chdiauci, he knew
that the ¡secretary would tcoi 11 to \ lace las name to, andal pt,

I rom patuotic and tbepuiest motives that the Piesidentand

No Senator had yet declared him&elf m lavor of trie plan,

ofthatde«cnption,hewould votefor it He had, at the extra
session, suggested a plan somewhat similar, based on the sug-
gestions of Mr Jefferson, in a speech, extracts from which he
read to the Senate as follows Mr Jefferson has told us, in his
fetter to Mr Gallaun, in 1803, to be lound in the fomfh volume
of his works, page thirteen, in which, after denouncing a Bank
of the United State-., he advises 'an independent use of our
own money, holding ourown bank mail the deposites where
ttisreceived, and letting the 7Vefl&«rergivehis draftor note
for payment at any paiticular place, which, n a well conducted
Go\ernment ought to have as much credit as any private
draft, or bank note, or bill, and would give us the same factli-
fteswhichwe derive from the banks" Here, then, was Mr.
Jefferson's sy-tem, proposed by him when President, to his Se
cretary of thp Treasury, in 1803 Let, then all these receivers
in all the States, thus placed under the control of Congress, and
not of the Lxecutive be permitted to receive on deposite gold
an! silver to the estimated amouUofthe public revenues, in-
cluding the lands from year to year say twenty three millions
of dolíais, in sum3, say never less than fi'ty dollars and when
this gold and silver is deposited with these receivers for the
lagiumate and constitutional purpose of being u^ed in pay-
ment oi thp pubhedues, and so receivable everywhere through-
out the Union, let these receivers give these certificates of de-
posites of actual specie with them, let them be siened by ihe
ireasurer in advance, and tobe fi led up by the leceivers with
whom ihe deposite is made íedeemable m specie at the place of
deposite and receivabieeveiywherempajmentofpubhedues,
and let them be limited to the amount of revenue, and the
cheapest exchanges and currency of uniform value would he
furnished, much better than cou'd be lunched by this Bank,
and free from the ruinous fluctuations and dteadful frauds and
abu es which wpieirherent in the banking system State or Na
tional Tht  too, wou d keep the «pecie in .he country, to
guaid against convuKons, instead of driving it out of it, as was
done by the banks, it would furnish an exchange currency,
founded on no loans of money or discounts in any form, but re
presented, dollar lor dollar, tby actual specie Or, if thought
desirable, the amount thus to be deposited might be limited by
the Treasurer each year to one half or one third of the revenue
of the preceding \ear, and for the remainder of the revenue
each year, the public creditors, who preferred it to specie,
might be permitted to íeceive in payments to them, m sums not
less than fifty dollars, the bills of he Government, receivable
everywhere, in payment of pubhedues, and the drafts of dis-
bursing officers might also be pei muted to en culate as a medium
of exchange This would separate altogether the Government
from the barks and the public moneys fiom the Executive
p wei It would be what Mr lefleison called "our own bank
