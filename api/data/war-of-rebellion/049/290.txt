Major-General STONEMAN,

Chief of Cavalry Bureau:

I ordered General Scammon to direct General Duffie to hold himself in readiness for an important movement. The following telegram just received. Will you please issue an order authorizing Captain Gardner or Captain Stealy, assistant quartermasters, to purchase the horses?

General KELLEY:

General Duffie needs 200 horses at once. So many are unserviceable that his command be efficient without this number in addition.

SCAMMON,

Brigadier-General.
