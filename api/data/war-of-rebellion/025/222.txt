J. H. HAMMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 17, 1862.

Major-General GRANT, Corinth, Miss.:

Do everything in your power to prevent Price from crossing the Tennessee River. A junction of Price and Bragg in Tennessee or Kentucky would be most disastrous. They should be fought while separate.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

ROSECRANS', September 17, 1862.

General GRANT:

Stanley's division marches to-night for Davenport's Mill, near Jacinto, where all the regiments meet. Hamilton moves forward to-night. I will not leave here until 8 a. m. to-morrow, in order to get all the news. I will then move to Jacinto and connect my headquarters with Burnsville and Rienzi by lines of vedette posts for prompt and rapid communication with your headquarters. Du Bois could and ought to send a couple of companies to occupy and keep Jacinto in order. The Seventh Kansas will watch the front. It seems our flag-of-truce bearers did not see the troops they report at Baldwyn.

Brigadier-General.

ROSECRANS', September 17, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Hamilton has sent out Mizner with a regiment of infantry and all our cavalry, under Mizner, toward Barnett's, on the Jacinto and Iuka road. The only thing we can do to prevent Price passing through the defiles of Bear Creek east is to push that division on him and follow it with all Stanely's force while Ross makes a strong demonstration on his front. This is safe for a day or two if we can keep spies from running to Breckinridge and Van [Dorn and] Price and you can hold your hand against [them]. I can pursue with my entire force, which, including Du Bois and Danville, will be about 13,000 of all arms.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

ROSECRANS', September 17, 1862.

General GRANT:

Mizner's dispatch just in reports that the cannonading of our reconnoitering party ceased at 4.40 last evening, and that about 8 o'clock last
