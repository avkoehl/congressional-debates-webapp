half of the fine so imposed shall be for the

That section eight be amended by striking
out of said section all after the words "until an
appointment filling the vacancy shall be made.''
That section fourteen be amended by striking
out all after the enacting clause, and inserting
in lieu thereof the following: that in case any
person shall be absent from his or her residence
or place of business at the time an assistant
assessor shall call for the annual list or return,
aud no annual list or return has been rendered
by such person to the assistant assessor as re-
quired by law, it shall be the duty of such as-
sistant assessor to leave at such place of resi-
dence or business, with some one of suitable
age and discretion, if such be present, other-
wise to deposit in the nearest post office, a note
or memorandum, addressed to such person,
requiring him or her to render to such assist-
ant assessor the list or return required by law
within ten days from the date of such note or
memorandum, verified by oath or affirmation.
And if any person, on being notified or required
as aforesaid, shall refuse or neglect to render
such list or return within the time required as
aforesaid, or if any person without notice, as
aforesaid, shall not deliver a monthly or other
list or return at the time required by law, or if
any person shall deliver or disclose to any as-
sessor or assistant assessor any list, statement,
or return which, in the opinion of the assessor,
is false or fraudulent, or contains any under-
statement or undervaluation, it shall be lawful
for the assessor to summon such person, his
agent, or other person having possession, cus-
tody, or care of books of account contain-
ing entries relating to the trade or business
of such person, or any other person he may
deem proper, to appear before such assessor
and produce such book, at a time and place
therein named, and to give testimony or answer
interrogatories under oath or affirmation re-
specting any objects liable to tax as aforesaid, or
the lists, statements, or returns thereof, or any
trade, business, or profession liable to any tax
as aforesaid. And the assessor may summon,
as aforesaid, any person residing or found with-

And when tlfe person intended to be summoned

district where such person may be found, and
there make the examination hereinbefore au-
thorized. And to this end he shall there have

be found, by an attested copy delivered'to such
person in hand or left at his last and usual
place of abode, allowing such person at the rate
of one day for each twenty-five miles he may
be required to travel, computed from the place

assessor shall be evidence of the facts it states
on the hearing of an application for an attach-
ment; and when the summons requires the
production of books, it shall be sufficient if
such books are described with reasonable cer-
tainty. In case any person so summoned shall
neglect or refuse to obey such summons, or to
give testimony, or to answer interrogatories as
required, it shall be lawful for the assessor to
apply to the judge of the district court or to a
commissioner of the circuit court of the United
States for the district within which the person
so summoned resides for an attachment against
such person as for a contempt. It shall be the

such application, and, if satisfactory proof be
made, to issue an attachment, directed to some
proper officer, tor the arrest of such person,
and upon his being brought before him to pro-
ceed to a hearing of the case ; and upon such
hearing the judge or commissioner shall have
power to make such order as he shall deem
proper, not inconsistent with the provisions of
existing laws for the punishment of contempts,
to enforce obedience to the requirements of the
summons and punish such person for liis de-
fault or disobedience. It shall be the duty of

ing that derived from the evidence elicited

own view and information, such list or return,
according to the form prescribed, of the prop-
erty, goods, wares, and merchandise, and all
articles or objects liable to tax, owned or pos-
sessed or under the care or management of such
person, and assess the tax thereon, including
