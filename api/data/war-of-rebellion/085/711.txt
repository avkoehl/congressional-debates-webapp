JEFFERSON CITY, October 8, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have the honor to report the enemy massed against our right in force this morning, but withdrew without making an assault. Our cavalry are now pounding the rear of their column. The enemy were badly punished in the fight yesterday. A large number killed and wounded. We dismounted and captured one piece of artillery and hold several prisoners. We spent the entire night in strengthening our works. Never have men accomplished more in the same period of time then the fragments of district commands, militia and citizens, who have gathered here for the defense of the capital. The command deserves great praise for their industry, energy, and determination. We were less than 7,000 strong, all told, soldiers and citizens. Price's army is much larger than you have estimated it; only a portion of it was at Pilot Knob. General Cabell is along and commanded his brigade in the action yesterday. General Pleasonton has assumed command and will give you the situation as he finds it.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
