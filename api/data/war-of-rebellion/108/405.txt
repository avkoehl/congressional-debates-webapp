HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Goldsborough, December 4, 1861.

Brigadier General J. R. ANDERSON,

Commanding, &c., Wilmington, N. C.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 3rd instant has been received. I am fearful that we will find it difficult to replace the troops sent to South Carolina. I have been instructed to relieve the Third Georgia Regiment at Roanoke Island by a North Carolina regiment and to send the Georgia regiment back to Norfolk, so that the Secretary of War must have been misinformed in regard to matters when he suggested that I might furnish you a regiment from that island. The Governor has but a part of a regiment at Raleigh armed, but it is not yet equipped. When is is equipped I shall be compelled to send it to Hude County to rpelace the regiment sent to Roanoke. He gives me no encouragement in expecting any other troops; his plea is that he has no arms for them. In regard to the battery at Huggins' Island, I don't exactly see where the troops are to come from. I had hoped that I might have been offered artillery companies, but none have offered. I will write to the Governor on the subject, and will again address you in regard to the matter.

In haste, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
