HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Nashville, Tenn., April 13, 1864.

General HURLBUT,Memphis:

In my dispatch of the 8th the mistake is with the telegraph operator, who will correct.

Let the command come round by Cairo and the Tennessee River. I ant Mower's command, because of Mower in person. The three regiments can have their furloughs from Cairo. I write fully by mail through General McPherson.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

APRIL 13, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville:

It is reported that Forrest was crossing the Tennessee River yesterday near Hamburg. The information came from Colonel Rowett, Seventh Illinois, stationed near Florence. Forrest is reported to have 6,000 men; only 100 had got across when he received his information. The Seventh Illinois, mounted, and Ninth Ohio Cavalry have been ordered to push rapidly over in that direction to ascertain the facts and watch the movements.

General Garrard, at Columbia, and the regiment of State troops at Clifton should be notified.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Nashville, Tenn., April 13, 1864.

General McPHERSON,Huntsville:

Forrest can hardly attack Columbus and cross the Tennessee at Hamburg the same day. Let him develop his design. I want him to stay up in that pocket till your two divisions get together at Cairo. Go on getting your command ready for the big move.

W. T. SHERMAN.

Major-General.

HUNTSVILLE, April 13, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I presume General Brayman has made use of all the available forces at Cairo. There must have been 700 or 800 men, composed of detachments of the Seventeenth Army Corps, at Cairo, and possibly one or two regiments going or returning from furlough. If the commanding officer exercised proper vigilance and did not allow himself to be surprised, I do not think Forrest can take the place.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
