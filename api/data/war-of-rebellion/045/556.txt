Major-General BUTTERFIELD,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The dispatches just read and forwarded indicate the enemy moving from Fairfield, through Jack's Mountain. He might pass through Jack's Mountain to Mechanicstown, moving on Frederick, or through the mountain toward Hagerstown. In either case, ought I not to move on Emmitsburg as quickly as possible? As such movement might conflict with operations based on Sedgwick's information, which caused you to order me to halt, I will await your orders. Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
