foreign nations and their subjects, $2,000,000,000,
and it makes an aggregate of public debt of
$4,000,870,928. This vast, astounding public
debt 1ms been created within the past four years,
while the debt of Great Britain, which the people
of the United States have heretofore contemplated
with amazementand revulsion, is$3,914,037,634,
and lias been aggregating for neai ly two centuries.
In 1856 her total of property was $33,402,720,000,
is now more than $35,000,000,000, whih- that of all
the United States, in 1860, was $16,159,616,068
It is thus seen that our public debt on the 1st of
July next will be upwards of twenty-eight per
cent., or more than one fourth of the aggregate
property of the whole people of oil the United
States in I860; and that of England is less than
nine per cent., and less than one eighth part of the
aggregate of her property. The ravages of war
have greatly reduced the productiveness and value
of our property; and one of its great classes,
3,953,587 slaves, worth more than $1,800,000,000,
has been rendered worthless by the unjust and
unconstitutional measures of the President and
Congress. It may be safely assumed that our
public debt to-day amounts to one third of the
present value of all the property of the United
States. When the war terminates, and the coun-
try returns, as it must return, to a gold and silver
circulation, and that becomes the measure of the
value of all property and all production, how
greatly will those valuesshrink toward theamount
of the public debt, and how proportionably oner-
ous will it become to the people of the United
States \
The Secretary of the Treasury has been able
to keep the great machine, the Government, run-
ning for some time, by issuing an average daiiy
irredeemable paper currency of over $2,500,000.
Let us examine how he will get through the next
fiscal year, and what will be the probable increase
of the public debt at its close, it has been said
by Senators who know, that there are now in the
military service over 1,000,000 men, and that
700,000 have been putin the field since 17th Octo-
ber last. It was a generally received fact at the
beginning of this war that the whole cost of our
ai mies, including every thing except ordnance and
fortifications, could be proximately asceitained
by allowing $1,000 per head per annum for the
whole number,and that it was in truth something
above that rate. That cost has since been ma
terially augmented by increased pay and, by the
enhanced price in a depreciated currency of all
military supplies, transportation, &c. The Sec-
retary's estimates of demands for the next year
are, estimated balance of former appropriations,
un<jxpend''d, §350,000,000; for the civil service,
$27,973,194; tm pensions and Indians, $9,631,304;
for the War Department, $536,204,127; for the
Navy Department,$142,618,785; forinterestonthe
public debt, $85,387,677, making an aggregate of
$1,151,815,088; but as usual he is largely under
the true nuuk. The greatness of his under-esti-
mate will be undeniable and striking when it is
considered that the estimates were made about
the 1st of December last, and in the interim the
pay of the soldiers has been increased, one hun-
dred thousand hundred days' men have been ac-
cepted by the President from the Governors of
several of the States, and more than fifty thou-
sand negro soldiers, m addition to over five hun-
dred thousand white troops, have been mustered
into the service. The amount of the Army ap-
propriation bill for the next year, that has already
passed the Senate, foots up $518,725,716, and
Slaving gone back to the House it will probably
be increased to $520,000,000; and another mili-
tary appropriation bill of $25,000,000 for the hun-
dred days' men has passed.
The Secretary's estimate for the military ser-
vice of next yearhaseven now been transcended
more than $9,000,000. If we estimate for the
heavy increased expenditures in that branch, and
remember that the deficiencies voted for it at the
present session amount to near $100,000,000, and
that the present strength of the Army is over
1,000,000 men, costing an average of more than
$1,000 per head, and that his under-estimate for
this year is $741,092,037, the Army expenditures
for the next year c.nmot be fairly estimated at
less than $800,000,000. It will be above that
mark by many millions. The Secretary's esti-
mate of $6,129,042 for Indian affairs and pensions
will prove greatly inadequate. The number of
our killed and wounded on every b.attle-field since
the beginningofthe year is unquestionably above
100,000,and befote its close will swell to 150,000.
We will have the Iargestand most costly pension
roll that the sun overlooked downupon. I would
advance that item of the Secretary's estimates to
$30,000,000, with the certainty of a largely pro-
eressingand mournful increase. He also deducts
$400,000,000 as the estimated amount of appro-
priations that will not have been called for at the
end of the fiscal year, 30th June, 1865. The
Secretary's item of $85,387,677 forinterestonthe
public debt also must be advanced. In his ex-
pose of 14th May, he states the amount of inter-
estupon the publicdebt payable in legal currency
to be more than $20,000,000, and that payable in
coin to be $49,472,714, which will be increased
about$4,000,000 for interest on his advertised loan
of $75,000,000. He will have to borrow other
large sums and pay the interest in the same me-
dium, as he can get money only on that condition.
I will then set down $150,000,000 in greenbacks
for the payment of interest on the public debt the
ensuing year, and that amount will prove in-
sufficient. The requirements for the whole ser-
vice will be as follows:
For the War Department   §800,000,000
For the Navy, SecrU.ny'se&tirnate  142,618,785
For civil service, Secretary5*, estimate  27.973,194
For pensions and Jnd.au department  30,0u0,000
Inteies-tan public debt  150,o00,000
For dcficicuciets    100,000,000
$1,230,591,979
The Secretary's total estimate for the next
year's service is $1,151,815,088; mine is $1,250,-
591,979. He includes $350,000,000 of appropri-
ations that he had in his previous estimates as-
sumed to be uncalled for at the end of this fiscal
year; I excluded it, because I have already com-
puted it as a part of the public debt. He states
the amount for the next year's service for which
it will he necessary to provide by loans to be
$544,978,548, which will be that much added to
the puhhc debt; but he deducts $400,000,000 for
uncalled appropriations. This sum will not only
exist in the form of unsatisfied demands against
the United States, but will actually be voted by
laws of Congress to be paid out of the Treasury,
and therefore show the publicdebt to be that much
more.
According to the principle laid down by the
Secretary, that half the expenditures of each year
should be raised by taxation and other resources,
and the other half could be safely boriowed,
$625,295,989 have to be raised by each of those
modes, and $1,250,591,978 by both of them for
the next year's service. Let us examine how
nearly all the sources of our revenue are likely to
realize this required amount. The customs on
the importation of goods, the internal taxes, sales
of public lands, and some few miscellaneous
sources constitute the streams of our national
revenue. In all times of heavy public disburse-
ments the uniform infirmity of the Treasury esti-
mates is to overstate the anticipated receipts and
to understate the expenditures; and under this
Administration this infirmity has increased pro-
portionably with the enormous demands upon
the Treasury. The last branch of this proposi-
tion I have already established. The Secretary's
estimate of receipts from internal revenue for the
year ending 30th June, 1863, was $85,456,303,
but the amount received was only $37,640,787.
His estimate from the same source for the pres-
ent year was $150,000,000, but in his annual re-
pot t he informs us that the actual receipts for the
first quarter ending 30th September, 1863, were
$17,599,713. I have seen no statement of the
produce of either of the succeeding quarters; but
at the same rate the total for the year would be
$70,398,852, less than one half of the amount esti-
mated by the Secretary. But suppose it to be
true, as it probably is, that the first was the least
productive of all the quarters, in the absence of
all information, it would be liberal to allow for
the whole year $100,000,000. This would bhow
that notwithstanding the Secretary's experience
of the workings of the internal revenue system,
for one year he had overestimated its fruits
$50,000,000, or that when he had expected tjifee
dollars from it he had received only two. s
But these estimates of theSecretary were made
1st of December last, and the supplies are about
to be enlarged by the passage (if the bill under
consideration, and of a new tariff bill; in both of
which there will be some addition to the subjects,
and considerable increase in the rates of taxation.
There will certainly be a large augmentation in the
produce of both bills over that of the existing laws,
but what will be the proximate amount of either,
and particularly of the internal revenue law, will
hardly admit of conjecture. But guided by the
lights of experience a limit may be reasonably as-
sumed for both, which they will not transcend, at
least for some years.
It must not be forgotten that the business and
consumption of the people are the life-gj ving forces
of our revenue system; and that business and con-
sumption is always measured and limited by pros-
perity and ability to purchase. The continuance
of the war, though it may individually, and even
locally, by the large production of war supplies,
stimulate these elements of a teeming Treasury,
will greatly weaken and reduce them generally.
The inevitable consequence will be a largely di-
minishing business and consumption and receding
revenue. The supplies are to be derived largely
from heavy imposts upon the consumption of
spirits and tobacco, in all their forms; and also
upon manyother articlcsof luxury. TheeXtrav*
agance, bad habits and vices of the people form
the corner-stone of our financial edifice, and their
general and radical reform would overthrow it
irretrievably. The use of spiiits and tobacco
wastes more of health and morals than even pe-
cuniary means. They could fall into almost total
disuse with various and immense advantage to
their devotees; and the confidence expressed by
some that the enormous taxes about to be imposed
upon them will not materially reduce their con-
sumption will turn out to be a great delusion.
How facile and effective too could party oppo-
sition be made by combinations both for total ab-
stinence and restricted use.
" Man wants but little here below,
Nor wants that little long."
Under our almost universally burdensome and
grinding taxes the truth embodied in this couplet
we will see verified in our country as we have
never seen before. Limited resources, inability
to purchase, inexorable necessity will compel an
economy with the great body of our people to
which they have heretofore been strangers, and
that will tell with power on the Treasury of the
United States. "Experience will prove that the
increased rates of the new revenue laws will be
essentially neutralized by restricted consumption,
in the light of these considerations, and of the
facts that the produce of the existing tariff law
was for the fiscal year ending 30rh June, 1863,
$69,059,642, and for the first quarter of the pres-
ent year was $22,562,018, and the Secretary's
estimate for the remaining three quarters are
$50,000,000, the maximum of revenue from the
new tariff bill for the next year may be assumed
to be $100,000,000. And the receipts of inter-
nal revenue having been during the last year
$37,640,787, and their actual and estimated re-
ceipts for the year that expires with this month
being $100,000,000, the produce under the new
bill cannot reasonably be estimated for the next
year as large as$200,000,000. But^I will concede
even that high figure, and the resources of the
Treasury will be:
From internal revenue  $'200,000,000
Fioin customs  100,000,000
From lands, estimated by the Seert'tmy  1.000,000

Amount or public debt, 1st July, 1864 2,000,870.926

This will be less than the indisputable, the
recognized public debt, besides which there will
be the vast amount of unadjusted claims against
