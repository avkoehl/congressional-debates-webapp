General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Your dispatch in regard to a small Alabama brigade for Mobile just received. I am ready to sent it if the necessary is great. Cannot, however, do so till day after to-morrow owing to the break in the road. Have telegraphed General Maury to know the condition of affairs at Mobile. The brigade ought not to leave here except in case of great emergency. Please answer.
