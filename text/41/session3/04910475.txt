DEPORTS 01' COMMITTERS.
Sir. WARNER. The Committee on Public
Lands, to whom was referred the petition of a
committee appointed by a convention of citi-
zens of Alabama, praying a grant of certain
lands to the Tennessee and Coosa railroad,
the same as originally granted by act of Con-
gress approved June 3, 1856, have instructed
me to report it back, and, the Senate having
acted on the subject, ask to be discharged from
its further consideration.
The report was agreed to.
VIRGINIA MILITARY DISTRICT IN OiltO.
Mr. WARNER. The Committee on Public
Lands, to whom was referred the bill (H, R.
No. 175) to cede to the State of Ohio the
unsold lands in the Virginia military district
in said State, have directed me to report it
back without amendment, and to recommend
its passage.
Mr. THURMAN. I ask the unanimous
consent of the Senate that that bill be put on
its passage now. I think there is no objection
to it whatsoever. 1 am personally acquainted
with the facts in the ease. These are wild
lands, the remnant of what is called the Vir-
ginia military district in Ohio, lands which
Virginia had retained for the satisfaction of
warrants granted to her soldiers in the Revo-
lution. The laws authorizing the entry and
survey of those lands for the satisfaction of
those bounties have all ceased for many years-,
and the lands must lie there unsurveyed, of
no use to anybody in the world, unappropri-
ated, vacant lands, unless some such measure
as this shall pass. I believe it passed unani-
mously in the House of Representatives, and
it has been referred to a committee of the
Senate and is now reported back. I hope, if
there be no objection, that it will be put on
its passage at once.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
reported for information, after which the Chair
will ask for objections, if there be any.
The Chief Clerk read the bill, which pro-
poses to cede to the State of Ohio the lands
remaining unsurveyed and unsold in the Vir-
ginia military district in that State, upon the
condition that any person who at the time of
the passage of the act is a bona fide, settler on
any portion of the land may hold not exceed-
ing one hundred and sixty acres so by him
occupied by his preempting the same, in such
manner as the Legislature of the State of Ohio
may direct.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Before that bill is taken
up for action, I should like to inquire what is
the particular haste about it which makes it
necessary to do the extraordinary thing of con-
sidering it now.
Mr. THURMAN. As I am so vffry familiar
with that subject, having lived in that district
a gieat part of my life, i can answer the ques-
tion of the Senator from Vermont. There is
no haste about this at all. Virginia, by her
deed of cession of the northwestern territory,
reserved the lands between the Scioto and Lit-
tle Miami rivers, in the State of Ohio, for the
satisfaction of the bounty in land promised to
her soldiers in the Revolution on the conti-
nental establishment, that is, in the regular
Army. Those lands were taken up under a
system peculiar to that land district, what
were called entries for survey. They were not
surveyed into sections at all; but a principal
surveyor was appointed, who appointed depu-
ties ; and a person could enter the lands in
any shape he pleased and in any quantify he
pleased, and then the lands were surveyed
under the orders of the principal surveyor of
the district, and, upon the proper papersbeing
returned to the Department here, first the
Department of State, afterward the Depart-
ment of War, and finally the Interior Depart-
ment, if everything was found regular, patents
were issued. The consequence of this system,
not a very good one it is true, is that all the
good lands have long since been taken up, and
there is nothing left but a few sterile hills.
Mr. EDMUNDS. How many acres?
Mr. THURMAN. The estimate is that there
is not at the outside over one hundred thou-
sand acres of land.
Mr. WARNER. The report of the Com-
missioner of the General Land Office puts it
at not to exceed forty thousand acres. Other
parties are of opinion it will not reach over
ten or fifteen thousand acres.
Mr. THURMAN. There are not ten thou-
sand acres of good land left. Now, I wish to
say one word farther, and it is this: when
Congress passed the last scrip law to give scrip
to the Virginia claimants they required Vir-
ginia to relinquish all claim to that land, which
she did; that was perhaps twelve or fifteen
years ago.; and ever since then that land has
lain there unoccupied, the title being in the
United States; but there is no provision of law
