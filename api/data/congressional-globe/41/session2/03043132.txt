tors of General John A. Rawlins, for the ben-

Louise Garesch6, with the bill (S. No. 618)
increasing the pension of Mary Louise Gare-
sch6, widow of Colonel Garesch6, have in-
structed me to submit an adverse report. I
may say in presenting the report that the com-
mittee report adversely not from any waut of
sympathy with this lady, and a great many
others in the same situation, but as a matter
of duty, which we feel compelled to do on the
ground that there are hundreds and thousands
of ladies occupying precisely the same position
of necessity and of sympathy with respect to
the duty of the Government that she does.'
We thinfc that she and others like her will be
obliged to wait until "We shall be able to make
a general provision for them all alike, when
the country gets a little stronger.

objection the bill will be indefinitely postponed.

tion. We ask to be discharged from its further
consideration.
The report was agreed to.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The same committee, to
whom was referred the petition, of Margaret
C. Bell, praying foran increased pension, make
an adverse report. This petition stands on
precisely the same grounds that the bill in favpi
of Mrs. Garesch6 does. She is the widow of
Rear Admiral Bell, who very gallantly served
in the war; she'gets thirty dollars a month and
wants fifty dollars. Acting upon the same
reasons, the committee have instructed mo to
report adversely on this and to ask to be dis-
charged from its further consideration. If it
should be the will of the Senate to grant the
increase in this case, there are a great many
we shall desire to act on favorably.
The report was agreed to.

whom was referred the petition of William H.

pensions on account of being employed in the
civil service of the United States,have instructed
, me to report the same back, and ask to be
j discharged from its further consideration.
! We do not think it wise to enter on any legis-
lation upon that subject.. .
, The report was agreed to.
