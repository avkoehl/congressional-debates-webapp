River, so keep me posted most thoroughly of everything. Make sure by line of couriers to La Vergne, or else to Nashville, so that there can be no mistake.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, March 6, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Dispatch received. I have less than 5,000 infantry, raw and unorganized. To attack the enemy successfully, and hold this point, I should have at least 5,000 more of veteran infantry. Can [move] against him whenever such additional force is furnished. Two companies of cavalry started for Steedman as soon as your dispatch was received, to open courier line. It is hardly possible to hear from them yet.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, March 6, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Flag of truce in. Van Dorn replies that our dead are buried and wounded cared for; declines my request. Their force is about 12,000-mounted infantry, cavalry, and artillery; main body this side of Spring Hill; six generals (Van Dorn, Whitfield, Cosby, Wheeler, Forrest, and Armstrong).

Our loss in killed, 50; wounded, 200. Rebel loss, 150 killed; 500 to 600 wounded. Rebels say our men fought desperately, and only gave up when enemy surrounded.

We have ten days' rations. You can now judge whether it is judicious for our small force to attack double its numbers of old troops, in their chosen position, leaving our rear, for 30 miles, uncovered.

Respectfully,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, March 6, 1863.

General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Captain Merrill will be here to-morrow. Fortifications will be done in about one week. About ten days' rations, and one hundred and fifty to each man, on hand. No infantry coming in. Good night; am sick and tired out; had no sleep for a week.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, TENN., March 6 [7?], 1863.

General GARFIELD:

Received dispatch from Sheridan a few minutes since. Is on the march. He will be midway between this and Triune some time tomorrow. The roads are nearly impassable. No firing heard here, except our own, to clean up. Sheridan has only his division. I want six regiments from Mitchell; one of his brigades is ready to move.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.
