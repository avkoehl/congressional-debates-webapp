General THOMAS, or General WOOD:

General Grose has just ridden along and in front of the picket-line of my own and Beatty's division, and reports that there is nothing in front of my left for half a mile nor in front of the center of the Third for three quarters of a mile. The enemy have, he thinks, more fires than usual, and they were in motion. He could not tell what they were doing.

Orders of the day for the Fourth Army Corps for to-morrow, December 16 1864:

If the enemy is in their front at daylight to-morrow morning division commanders will advance at that time, attack, and carry whatever may be before them. If the enemy retreat to-night we will follow them. General Elliott, commanding Second Division, will cross to the east of the Franklin pike, then move southward parallel to it. He will deploy two regiments, connect with skirmishers, and the rest of his division will move by flank. General Kimball will follow, then General Beatty. The batteries attached to each division to-day will accompany them to-morrow. Ten ambulances and five ammunition wagons will follow each division.
