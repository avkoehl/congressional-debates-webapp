gun of her. General Bartlett [Barton?] is in command at Warrenton, headquarters, 1 1/2 miles from town, where they have three regiments between Warrenton and Vicksburg. General T. H. Taylor is SECOND in command.

The Confederate themselves burned the steamer Natchez, up the Yazoo River, to prevent her falling into the hands of our forces. They also blew up the Confederate gunboat Star of the WEST for the same reason.

I should like that Major-General Steele should have access to these papers.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MEMPHIS, TENN., March 25, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT, Memphis:

Scouts in from south bring dispatches from one at Mobile and Meridian up to the 17th. No movement of troops, except heavy guards have been posted along the railroad. Forces this side of Meridian same as before reported, except two regiments of infantry have come up to collect corn and everything in shape of forage, and provisions are being collected and carried south over Mobile and Ohio Railroad. Are pushing the bridges to completion to Tupelo, to enable them to take out the corn in Blackland County [?]. Gunboats Robb and Silver Lake [Wave?] went up Tennessee River yesterday; passed Pittsburg about 4 p. m.

The scout reports that it is currently reported south that two of our goats in Yazoo were captured, but does not consider it reliable; also that Banks had got to rear of Port Hudson, and that they all think it will fall, and that two of Farragut's gunboats had passed Port Hudson.

G. M. DODGE.
