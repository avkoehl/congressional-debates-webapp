Brigadier General U. S. GRANT, U. S. Army.

GENERAL: I have pleasure in returning to you Colonel Dougherty, the last of your command who was wounded in the battle of the 7th ultimo and who has so far recovered as to allow of his removal.

I also return to you Lieutenant Smith, who has been the attendant and nurse of Colonel Dougherty and whose devoted services may still be necessary to his comfort and ultimate recoverty. He is relased on parole.

The memorandum herewith sent you will show that in the exchange or release of prisoners heretofore made exclusive of that made through Colonel Buford in the first instance I have released 114 against 124 released by you.

I will send you so soon as the arrangements can be made the difference between these numbers with the understanding that henceforth those exchanged shall be made with a district regard to the numbers and grade of the prisoners exchanged.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Major-General, Commaning C. S. Army.
