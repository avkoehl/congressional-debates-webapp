WAR DEPARTMENT,

May 25, 1862-12.55.

Major-General DIX, Baltimore:

Four hundred and fifty-seven regulars started from Philadelphia at 10.20 o'clock to-night for Washington. They are parts of the Eighth and Twelfth Regulars, under command of Captain Pitcher. You will send them to Harper's Ferry instead of coming here. Arms will be forwarded to them at Harper's Ferry from here to-night. Please give his special attention. They will be useful in handling the artillery of position even before their arms arrive.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

GENERAL DIX'S HEADQUARTERS,

Baltimore, May 25, 1862. (Received 2.10.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Mr. Garrett is at my headquarters. Transportation is all ready for the battery, and one of my staff has gone to see it loaded. I send the only field artillery I have-six rifled cannon. The men well drilled and well commanded.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL DIX'S HEADQUARTERS,

Baltimore, May 25, 1862. (Received 4.35 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The Third Delaware Regiment, 750 strong, effective men, fully armed, provisioned, and equipped, will pass through here for Harper's Ferry about 5 this p. m., without change of cars. The light battery of six pieces is now loading up. Will dispatch it without delay.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, May 25, 1862.

(Received 5.50 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Before your dispatch was received I had ordered part of the force at Fort Federal Hill to be kept under arms to-night. I am sending the same orders to the other forts. I have no guns for the company ordered from Carlisle. Will you send them from Washington at once?

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, May 25, 1862.

(Received 8 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have just returned from Fort McHenry and Federal Hill. All is right at both. The two batteries you have ordered will quite suffice.
