WOOL.
In the bill it is proposed to bring the duty
down to a more reasonable sum. The rate
per cent, on combing wool is seventy per cent,
or a fraction uuder; while on the whole im-
portation it averages much too high. On some
kindsof wool it amountsto almostaprohibition.
This has a double operation. As raw material
it makes too high the cost of manufacture, so
as to injure both the sale and production ; and
this causes the demand for raw material to fall
off, and thus cuts off the demand for the wool
of the country. Hence, the farmer and laborer
suffers because of the high price of the wpolen
goods, and again by reason of the low price of
the wool he produces. The operation is readily
seen from the following table, (D,) showing
the amount imported, the rate of duty, and
the amount paid into the Treasury:

From this table it is seen that the largest
importation is of cheap carpet-wools, imported
for the purpose of making carpets in this coun-
try. Two thirds of all the wool imported into
this country is of this character, while half
the duties paid is upon this kind of wool.
This wool does not enter into competition at
all with our wool growers, and hence the duty
levied upon it is a legitimate duty, unless it
may be claimed that all raw material should
be admitted free of duty. But upon the other
classes of wools a lower rate of duty should be
fixed to encourage our manufactures by inci-
dental protection. The duty is now in the na-
ture of prohibitory; and this was fixed, as was
supposed, in the interest of the wool grower.
It, however, has had the contrary effect. Xhe
production of wool has declined ever since
the passage of the present wool tariff in 1867.
It has now had a trial of three years. During
the last two years wool has ruled lower than
at any time for a period of forty years ; sheep
have been sent to the butchers, the number
being gradually decreased until last year, ac-
cording to well-authenticated figures, the wool
clip was at least twenty per cent, below pre-
vious years. Some of the reasons for this de-
cline, as well as the statement of the facts, will
be found in the following article, taken from
the New York Commercial and Shipping List,
to which I call the attention of the House:
"The price of wool ruled remarkably steady
throughout 1870; but since the turn of the year there
has been an advance of five to seven per uent., based
upon an unusually light supply, the domestic clip
the past year, aside from California, having iallen
short, while the imports decreased some.thirty-
three and a third per cent, as compared with 18b9.
We commenced the current year with a stock ot
7.475.750 pounds of all kinds m this market against
11,964.800 pounds at the beginning■ of 18/0. It we
add the stock at Boston, about /.000,000 pounds, and
at Philadelphia 4,779,000 pounds, the total supply at
the three principal distributive centers was less than
20.000,000 pounds, or some twenty per cent, below
the quantity at the beginning of 18/0., Ihere is rea-
son to believe that the supply m the interior is also
smaller than it has been at this period for several
years. Meanwhile, with the goods market at length
freed from the glut of inferior woolens with which
it has been more or less incumbered since theclctse
of the war, and the value of the foreign staple in-
creasing at the sources of supply and in the chief
dependent markets, there would seem to be.a solid
basis for somewhat more remunerative prices lor
domestic wool. The comparatively low price ot
cotton and cotton fabrics, however, 13 likely to p re-
vent extreme prices. The prohibitive duty on nne
foreign wool has been partially compensated the
past year by heavy imports of wool on the skin, tne
arrivals at this port of the article in that shape last
year reaching 31,429 bales, against 8,841 bales in 1869.
Under the new tariff, enacted last July, a duty of
thirty per cent, is now exacted on sheep skins, ana
manufacturers are thus deprived of this source ot
supply. There is thus a possibility of an absolute
scarcity of wool when the mill-streams in.the east-
ern States become sufficiently swollen to enable the
idle factories to resume operations. And m view
of such a possibility a large number of the leading
woolen manufacturers of fehode land and Mm
saohusctts have issued an appeal to their ic'low
manufacturers of New England in fa\ or of the
importation of foreign wool and other raw mate
rials necessary to the manufacture of woolens free
" Tn this appeal, the ground is taken that protection
in tlie case of American woolen manufacturers costs
more in the end than it is worth, and that its cost
counterbalances the supposed benefits. The manu-
facturer, it is asserted, is obliged to pay duties in some
instances amounting to one hundred and ten per
cent, upon his wool, and duties correspondingly high
upon his other raw materials, while he is protected
upon his finished products by a duty which is dispro-
portionately low. Laboringunder the disadvantages
imposed by heavy taxes upon the crude materials of
their industries, the Now England' manufacturers
say they cannot compete on fair terms with foreign
manufacturers who receive their materials free, and
they are thus debarred from that measure of success
to which their capital, skill, and long experience
entitle them. They maintain that with the raw
materials free and a moderate dutyon foreign cloths
they can successfully compete with the foreign man-
ufacturer, while the wool-grower would at least be
no worse off than he has been since tho present wool
tariff went into operation. Thearginnentis certainly
plausible, and coming from experienced manufac-
turers, it should be duly considered by those who
m.ike our laws. The existing duty, as wo have seen,
amounts to a practical prohibition of foreign fine
wool, while it has not benefited the home wool-
grower. Our manufacturers have been deprived of
an essential quality of wool wherewith to produce
the finer kinds of fabrin which are made in Europe,
and, so ceasing to use the finer staple, other coun-
tries have been enabled to buy it all the cheaper,
and then sell it to us in a manufactured shape.
This appeal shows quite conclusively the futility
of efforts to reverse the established laws of political
economy."
Now, how does this effect the wool-grower?
By cutting off the demand for his wool. The
price of wool ruling low discourages the raising
of sheep and the growing of wool; and in this
way the number of sheep is reduced, and the
amount of the annual production likewise. If
wool-growing pays the farmer he turns his
attention to the business, increases his flocks,
and the annual production of wool is increased
with an annual gradual increase. Wool-grow-
ing will always pay in this country under a fair
demand with reasonable prices. We have all
over the western country large districts giving
as fine sheep-walks as can be found anywhere;
equal, if not better than the far famed Aus-
tralian sheep-walks. In Missouri, Kansas,
Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico,
California, and indeed the whole plain and
mountain country, is as fine a wool growing
region as the world produces. The hardy
varieties of sheep, producing the coarse wools,
are almost indigenous to all this country, and
in most of this vast region the annual cost of
keeping one of these sheep will not exceed
twenty-five cents; and yet the growing of wool
languishes all over this country. Why? Only
because of the present wool-tariff act of 1867 ;
and that that is so will require but a short
argument to establish.
In order to make a demand for wool, and to
make wool-growing a flourishing business,^there
must be establishments to work it up. Unlike
cotton, we have but little demand for wool
abroad. Our cotton supplies England with raw
material for her vast cotton manufactories, with
but a small supply from any other source;
while she draws her wool supply from the whole
world. Our wool, therefore, must be worked
up at home. But we do not raise it in varieties
sufficient to do this. We grow but little fine
wool, and on the fine wool necessary to work
up our coarse wool we have almost a prohibit-
ory duty; so that our manufactories cannot
run by importing a portion of their stock at so
high a rate of duty. Our mills can only work
on a narrow line of goods. The demand, there-
fore, is small, and our wool-growers suffer in
consequence. It there was but & small duty
on fine wool, so that our manufacturers could
import and buy it, they would then manufac-
ture the finer cloths and cassimeres from our
native wools mingled with the foreign finer
wool, and in this way create a greater demand
for our own wools, which would increase the
price and cause the business of wool-growing
to revive.
If we should import one hundred million
pounds of fine wool m a year it would more
than double the demand for our domestic wools.
It would have the same effect upon wool-grow-
ing in this country as the same causes did in
