27th Cons""1st Sess.
there weie unequivocal manifestations of public
opinion m its favor I think, however, the experi
mjent should be fairly tried to ascertain whether
the financial operations of the Government cannot
as well be carried on without the aid of a national
bank. If it is not necessary for that purpose, it does
not appear to me that one can be constitutionally
chartered There is no construction which I can
give the constitution which would authorize it, on
the ground of. affording facilities to commerce The
excitement which has been produced by the bank
question, and the number and respectability of those
who deny the right of Congress to charter one,
strongly recommend the course above suggested "
In some of the States of the Union, General Har
rison was supported on the ground that, if elected,
he would oppose a national bank m any form
Mr Chairman, I am admonished that " my hour
as almost run," and I will devcte the remainder oí
it to tracing some of 'the evils of the paper system
A national bank has, by expansion of its currency
and credit, and sudden contraction, produced re-
peated commercial revulsions, ani plunged the
country m univertal distress The lost bank was
chartered in 1816 It was wrung from a reluctant
people- by operating on their fears The war of
181$ had just ended The country was m distress
Some ot the State banks were m a state ol suspen-
sion, and were making preparation for an early re-
sumption, when the national charter was granted
Bui, fearing a dram upon them, they postponed a
resumption till February, 1817 The national
bank went into operation, and, by excessive expan-
sion of its paper issues, and sudden curtailment,
and dram upon the State banks for the precious
metals m 1819, it produced a commercial revulsion,
which was severe in its visitation upon the country
The distress was universal Every interest was
prostrate Agriculture, commerce, andmannfao
tures languished, laborers weie thrown out of em-
ploy , and the prices ot gram reduced Niks $ Re-
gister of August, 1819, thus describes the condition
of labor
"It is estimated that there are 20,000 persons
daily seeking woik in Philadelphia, m New Yoik
10,000 able bodied men are said to be wrndenng
about the streets looking ioi it, and if we add lo
them the women who desne something to do, the
amount cannot be less than 20,000, m Baltimoie
there maybe about 10,000 peisons in unsteady em-
ployment, or actually suffering because thty can-
not get into business We know several decent
men, lately ' good livers,' w ho now subsist on such
victuals as, two years ago, they would not hare
given to then servants in the km hen Heieare
50,000 persons in the thiee cities wholly or partially
idle, and m a state of positive suffering "
When Congress assimbled in thatyeu Mr John-
son, of Virginia, inttoduced i resolution m tie
House of Representatives, pioposing to annul the
national bank ( hirtei, on (he giound of foifcituie
fox repeated violation ot Us provisions, and tint it
had been the main agent in producing the universal
distress which then affluted the country The re-
solution was supported by Tohn Tyler, of Virginia,
in a speech of great eloquence and power , tnd I
beg leave to read a few extracts to the committee
" For, sir, (said he,) inasmuch as I believe the
creation of this corporation to be unconstitutional, I
cannot, without a violation of mj oath, hesitale to
repair the breach thus made in the constitution,
v hen in opportunity presents itself of doing so
without violating the public faith "

" For one, I enter mv protest against the banking
system, as conducted in th s country—a system
not lobe supported by anj correct principle ol po
litical economy. A gross delusion—the dream ot
a visionary—a system which lias done moie to
corrupt the moi<ils of society than any thing ike—
whi h has introduced i st nggle for wealth msiend
of that honorable snuggle w h ch governs the actions
of a patriot, andmaices ambi jon virtue—which has
made the husbandman spurn las cottage, and in-
troduced a spirit of luxury, at variance with the
simplicity of our institutions I call upon the warm
advocates of banking non to surrender their eirois
Shall I take them bv the hand and lead them
through our cities i Bankruptcy meets us at ev ery
step, ruin stares us everywhere in the face Shall
T be told of the benefits arising to commerce from
the coneentration of capita! "> Awav with the de-

ergy but for a moment, relaxation has followed,
and the torpor of death has ensued When you
first open your banks, muerMmstle ensues—a fie
titious goddess, pretending to be Wealth, stands at
the door, inviting all to enter and receive accom
modation Splendid palaces arise , the ocean is
covered with sails But some alteration in the state
of the country takes place, and, when the thought-
less adventurer, seated in the midst of his family, in
the imaginary enjoyment of permanent security,
sketches out to himself long and halcyon davs, his
prospects are overshadowed, and misery, rum, and
bankruptcy make their appearancp in the form of
bank curtailments If this be true—and I appeal
to the knowledge of all men fonts truth—I demand
to know if you can put down the system too soon '
Can we too soon escape the dangers by which we
are surrounded'' Sir, we actually possess the
lever ol Archimedes, and have a foot of ground on
which to rest it Our revenue amounts to upwards
of ¿20,000,000 annually Requne but a fourth, or
even a sixth, to be paid in gold or silver, what
would be the effect i The merchants would col
lect the notes of banks, and demand specie for them
and thus a test would be adopted, by means ol
which to ascertain the solvencj of each institution
The demand for specie, thus produced, would have
the beneficial effect ol introducing more of it into
the country, for money is like every other article,
and will find its way to the market where it is most
wanted The system might be enlarged gradually,
until your wishes should be consummated I know
the ground which I occupy, when I urge these con
siderations upon you A man regardful alone of
the fleeting and ephemeral popularity of the hour,
would hesitate in pressing them upon jou But I
should nothold myself entitled toyom countenance,
Mr Churman to the countenance of honest men,
ot, what is still more important, the approbation of
my conscience, if I could be operated on by such
motives or fears"

' There remains, then, to be considered but one
other point How would the Government he affect-
ed by a dissolution of this chart rl I piotest
against the idea that the Government cannot jet on
without this bank We arc not dependent on this
corporation Wretched, indeed, would be our
situation if such were the case Sir, I have every
confidence in the ability and talent of the Secretary
of the Treasury to devise some scheme as a substi
lute for the piesent We vJiall pay too much tor
the lacilmes which aie afforded the Treasury by
this institution '
Sir, if these are Virginia abstractions of which
pentletnen speak, I go tor them with moie than
Faslem idolatry, I embrace them with filial af-
fection, and, while life pulsates thevwtll animate
me to go forwaid, and commend them lo public
approbation They are principles which lie at the
foundation of public liberty in a free government
In their fn 1 operation, a concentration of wealth is
prevented, and anstocracy is shorn of i s power
to control ¿>nd oppress the masses ol the people, and
lob them ol the fiuits of well directed mdusti)
In l>-i2b the evils of the paper svstem were again
apparent By the operation of similar causes, ex
cessive paper iss íes and credits < n the part ol banks,
both State and national, aud sudden cmtailment,
another commercial revulsion occurred, w) ich in
volved the country in the deepest distress The
wheels of commeice were stopped—manufacturing
establishments closed—and laborers turned out of
employ The agricnltuial interest felt it with the
greatest severity, prices fell, and men were ruined
bj the depieeidtion of landed proptity This was
<l ii mg the administration of the venerable membei
fiom Massachusetts, (Mr Adams ) which \v is held
up the other clay by my colleague (Mr Barnard)
as the Augustine era of Ampncan fuslor} A na
tional bank was then m existence but it afforded
no panacea for the evils which then afflic ed the
countiy It served only to add fuel to the flame
which was <onsnmmg the vitals of public prosperi-
ty If it had not been armed with the public depo-
sites themons'er tself would have tumbled to rum
In 1826, the paper of all the New England banks,
including the New Ilampshne branch, \vas21 per
cent discount at New York, and is now onh three-
eights of onepercent The effects of this revulsion
ran through the years 1826 1827, and 182 > and
wcie felt with great severih particulaily in the
southern and western States The pros erny of
the country was m a state of partial eclipse until
General Jackson came into power    From the year
H. of Reps
1828 to 1833, business revived, the prices of all the
productions of the earth rose, the farmers and me-
chanics prospered In 1833 the deposites were re-
moved The bank determined on forcing a res-
toration, by carrying the country through the fiery
ordeal of public suffering, and opeiating on the
fears and distresses of the people Having ex- *
panded its issues and credits to an almost limitless
extent, it suddenly curtailed, and precipitated a
commercial revulsion as sudden as it was unexpect-
ed, and plunged the country in universal distress
This gave rise to the celebrated panicsession, when
lamentations issued out of the other end of this
Capitol, that "our canal was a solitude, and our
lakes a desert waste of waters," when the cry was
heard amid the fury oí the impending storm—re-
store the deposites '—restooethe deposites'—and when
the pensioned presses oi the country were charging
General JacKsou with being the author of all these
evils Sir, if t eneiai Jackson caused the com-
mercial revulsion of 1833, what caused it m 18261
\\ 1 at in 1819i In 1837 there was another explo-
sion, and the wrecks are still visible. And thus it
will be, under the exclusive paper system, as long
as-the constitution lasts If revived and continued
by a new national bank, we shall, as a people, ex-
perience periodical panics and revulsions—depre-
ciation of paper money—derangement of ex-
changes—'oss of confidence—bankruptcy—com-
meicial distress, and rum
Sir, I believe the people aie not prepared to eo
back and adopt the sjstem which has so oftei
wrought their mm lhey aie now engaged in
honest toil, the^ftnow not the chains you are forg-
ing , they think not that their representatives have
been assembled in ex raordinary Congress to|tas
ten upon them an institution which will control
their labor, their industry, their enterprise, and
their wealth,—an institution which has received
the frequent condemnation of the public "voice
But you may have the power and the will to do it
And ii you havifche power to charter a bank of
thirty millions fortwenty years, jou have the pow-
er to charter a bank of three hundred mill ons for
three hundred years Chatter vour bank, the peo-
ple will wage a constitutional, legal, interminable
war against it —a war of lepcal and extermination
agamst an institution not authorized by the consti-
tution, and hostile to public liberty.
