Mr TALLMADGE presente 1 a remons anee

He remarked that it was very numerously Mgn=d
by the most respectable business men of that city,
and he was glad to have this evidence, from tl at
quarter, of the favorable manner m wbioh this be-
nign measure had been received
He moved it referente to the Judiciary Coirmit-

it was a violation, rot rnly of tn  lei "', bu of t*> 
spirit cf the Constitution H" s* ou'd not now ha e
said a wad, nad not th s remons rarce from 8
Louis, the principal c ty of his State, been held
forth and appea'ed to as an evidence of the feelings
of the people of Missouri in favor of the Bankrupt
law now in operation He was in favor of a b 
mgn and benifcnt law operating equally and con
stitutionally But ih s law was very far from be
ing enutled to that cha acter He considered it a
mere sponging la^ for the abolition of all contraes
—a law n< t only impairing contracts, but destrnc
five of morals, and agrarian in its principles He
and the party to which he belonged, had been re-
peatedly alluded to as ag-anan m th"ir doc r nt*
Bat those wh i had passed this Bankrupt law, were
opposed by him and his friends on the very ground*
of its being agrarian m its principles d^strucive
of public morals, and unequal and iniquitous 11 its
optration
Gentlesren who have accused him and hi5frtends
of being agranan, ard have so repea'edlv said that
their acts have proved ínjun us to th  moials of
the people, and have prod ucea the distresses of the
country, will ven soon have to pa«3  the ordeal of
public judgment, and stand condemned themselves,
when  the mists have passed away which have
shroud d them    Then will be heard a different
ch?rac'er   of    the   measures   which   he   (Mr
Linn)  and his  friends have advocated, Ptid   of
those  of  the  gentlemen   who   have   denounced
them    The voice of the people will   be heard
in relation 10 this bankrupt law, as loud and de-
cisive as it was heard in relatnn to   their project-
ed tax on tea and coffee.    Gentlemen will have to
back out again, as they did then    The country is
going through a change something like a geologic?l
change.   It is going through a transition     It is,
geological y speaking, in a transition state    All he
desired was, that gentlemen would  ro longer de-
ceive them elves and others,   he desired that t! e
Senaie would investigate before it received the opi-
nions forced upon it as the opinions of the people
Was it not very well known that ooimons are mi-
nufactured by interested individuals to produce
certain results!   The greit mass of th  agricultu-
ral community,  sitting und r their own viae' an 1
under the shaJe of their own fig trees, or by  their
own fire = de>, know nothing of what is going on,
or what devices are  resorted to .in order to bnrg
the  nfluence of such opinions to bear  They knew

I      Mr TALLMADQE explain'd that hehil m«r -
lj smi", m present ng 'he remonstrar^e that i'vas
signed py some of the most re p e able c tizms, of
S   Loui   ?nd he was glad to have h'* e« d?^ce of
h  lavufble "eníime"ts pn'prt?m d m relat'on to
 h    law from that quarter    If pub ic c¡s nion was
>-pn ifa" u ed in t"at city m f^vor of the la   ,   t
v-is ii jt certainly by the signers cf th s r mon-
s >nrre
Hr LINN explaired th-t he had sail public
op iirn w?s got up for the ccwon, but did at t
y ty tn? «lgnpr Oi this reaionstrnrep Thevsy
in i hicti pub ic opinion is manufactured he woul j
explain. There are lithographic petitions prepared
bv in ere t \ nersons, who scatter them thnnghout
the who tountry, and obtain namps to them, by
j pajing the collector so much per name, as he has
heard, and believes to be true A cent apiede
will thus produce names m thousands, of those
who have not considered and discussed the merits
of the measure, and are perfectly unaware of its
consequences A great deal of public opinion has
been manufactured m th'S way. Ha did not say
it had been done m this instance—indeed he was
certain it had not, but that such is the way public
opinion has been got up generally in favor of the
Bankrupt law, is notorious Nojp he protested
against this sort of expression if opinion from
large cities b°ing enforced as the opmiGn of the
people It was a species of city influence on legis-
latum which he must protest against He pi o
testid against it as manufactured opinion to pass
for public op nion
As far as the remon trance now presented is
concerned, he b heved it was signed by many who
are in evry way respectable, and he was willing
to receive it as their opinion, but ceramly not as
the opinion of the ettiz ns of St Lnnis at large.
Mr TALLMADGE was very happy to Uatn
fiom the gentleman himself, that, althiu&h he be-
lieves such manufactures of public opinion as he
had described had been got up in other great cities
— here h?d been no such operation carried on in
St Louis. He was also glad to have his testimony
that the signers of toe íem nstrance from that cuy
were among its most resptctable inhabitants He
would see that this remonstrance was not one of
the lithograph petmons to which he had al uded,
and that it is not a mannfaciu'ed expression cf
opinion The Senator appealed to the experience
of the former Bankrupt law He also c mmented
in the stro"gest terms on the measures of the party
which passed this measure Yet, if gentlemen on
his (Mr. T's) side commented upon the measures
of their political opponents, fcrtat complaints were
made. Bat he would «ay that nothing shou'd pre-
vent him, on all occa ions be might think proper,
from commer ting with frppdom upon any system
of policy pre ented for his consideration He
would comment freely on the effects of measures,
and let the gentlem n on the other side do so too
Mr. LINN ob erved that he would readily ac-
cede to that As long as personalities were not
applied, there could be no abjection, to free discus-
sion and free comment And he was sure the
Senator from New York woul 1 not say that,
strongly ash  may havecommentelunon the mea-
sures aavecpted by thf Senator, he (Mr Linn) had
ever anphed personalities t   him
Mr TALI MADGE     Certainly not, sir
The memorial was then reierred to the Judiciary
Co*nmi tee
Mr SMiTH of Indiana presented a memorial
from cit zens of Wayne county, Indiana, remon-
strating against the amendment po tponement, or
repeal of the bankrupt law Mr S said he ti onld
take the cecis on to ^ay, that since he had, on a
farmer day, allud'd to the pendency of the bank-
rupt que tion m the Legislature of Indiana, that
b dy had acted upon resolutions instructing the
Sena'ors and requesting ihe Representatives from
the State to vote for tlie rep al of th  bankrupt
law, and the rc-sult, ss he p reeived from the pa
pe-s, was, hit the Sena e, composed of a majority
of Whigs hjd nassed ihe instructing resolutions,
vhi'> the Hoase of R presen'tiivps, compcs d of
a majority of Democr.- '•, had rcj-etedthtm—mem-
bers of path party voing differently By this it
seemed that that the bankrupt law ts?s rot a party
me sure in Indian? Mr S cou d, m all candor
say, that h- had never aivea a vote on tne mea-
sure as a par y vot* lie desired to represent the
wishes of ih3 pet pi  of the Sta   en all tccason*;
and he hid looked to the acti n of this Legsla'ure
wi h some colci ude, as h was no' certain «hat
th  opinion rf t e maj ray ci the peop e of the
State wa°, and op felt disposed 'o let t^e Legisla-
tuieso^e tie doubts that ren-d tn his mind.
Hence he had said tha> he vould co ¡form h « ac-
tion to f" instruction that ni gKt te g vpt He
had been called uprn to vo p on the qje tion of
repeal before th  final ae ton o! his Legislature wai

the action of the Sena e upon that question, the
friends of repeal bad chosen their ovn time for ac-
