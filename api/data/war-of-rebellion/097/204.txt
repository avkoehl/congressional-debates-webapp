HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS, March 27, 1865-10.30 a. m.

Major-General WEBB,Chief of Staff:

All is quiet along my lines. Picket firing, as usual, is kept up on portions of the line. Two deserters came in. One has reported from Fifty-third North Carolina. He has no news. The other is form a Louisiana regiment. The communication, under a flag, between General Hartrant and the rebel general Lewis ceased yesterday. They furnished us a list of our officers prisoners, and reported that there were none of our wounded at the hospital of Gordon's corps. A list of their wounded officers in our hands was furnished them, as was agreed on the day previous; also two more of their dead passed over to them, found after the truce had ceased of the day before. More deserters are now arriving at these headquarters, but have not yet been examined.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, March 27, 1865. (Received 11.45 a. m.)

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,Chief of Staff:

All of Hartrantft's regiments are now relieved and in reserve except one. This I propose having relieved to-night by the Eighteenth New Hampshire, which I have proposed assigning to Willcox's division, instead of consolidating with the Sixth New Hampshire, as was suggested some days ago. I will relieve the cavalry brigade at once and direct the commanding officer to report to General Davies.
