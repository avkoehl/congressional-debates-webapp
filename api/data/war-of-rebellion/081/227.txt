GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 19, 1864.

General BROOKS:

You can withdraw the troops, of you think best. As the dead are all rebels would it not be well to wait and let them ask. They will misrepresent it, and claim that we ask to bury our dead.

J. W. SHAFFER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS, June 19, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER,Chief of Staff:

It is doubtful if the enemy can see or know of the dead we want buried. They are close under our front, and will soon become very offensive to the men on picket.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.
