ment, and the only word or prov sion which
he had been abe to discover ia^ almost one. oí
ttie first in the instrument itself, and what is 1'
"The House of Representatives shall Le cimpo ed
of members chosen every second ytat by the peo-
ple of the several States " And they kt ew tnat,
up to this hour, no other than the people of the States
had had any part in the choice of members oí that
House they had quasi members, m the shape c f
delegates ftom the Temiónos, but they had no
' members" who did not come there by the ebc ice of
the people of the Sta cs The Constitution proceeds
"And the the elector in each State shall have the
qualifications íequisite for electors of the most nu-
merous braenh ot the State LegiJaturt"—and that
•was all there was it the wh le instrument on the
subject The electors of a member oí thp H m e

electors of members oí the most numerous br«>riih

people oí the State , whose representatives the\
are How aie they usually presented and denned'
in the Constitution of the State And uno «as
prepared to say that the j topic cl a s «rtjyn
gtate, forming to themselves a Constitution, can be
coHtrolled by this body in designam g tho e wiu
shall elect their offrers' The persons to represent
them at home, and here' For the argument goes to
that
He believed it had been an uncon idered po
sition of the hcrorable Senator—it must be a new
doctrine m this tountiy He admitted the Sta e 
usually confined the ngrt oí voting lo citizenship
Bat would it be said the people cf a Stale, m thp
formation of their Constitution and Government,
were compelled to do this' Where was the com-
pulsion' Suppose they did not do it or, suppose
they should say, in the Constitution of the Siate,
that an alum, with a residence of but one hour,
shall be a voter for the memb"rs of the moot nu-
merous blanch of the State Legislature, «ho was
to corree that decision' Where waa. mat h gh
court of appea s which could say that the Con t tu
tion ot a sovereign State v as unconstitutional' lie
believed it d d not exist in our irst tuuon , but that
the people, inhabiting a Territory, with a title
to become a Sta'e under this Government,
were sovereign, aid, m a legal sense, as inhabi-
tants of a State, were without Government, until
they made one for thtrrstlviis It his memriv
served him, they bad had a recent txampe, in-
volving this very pent, and if he misstated the
fact, he s^ou'd be corrected He believed,
at the formaron < f the Constitution for the
►Slate of Miemgan, free white inhabitant  if the
Territory were the per ins wno formed it, and who
elected delegates to the Coi vention is their age ts
In the Coi stitution adopted by that Convention a
mitauors and quahncations of voters were pr
scribed, but all tt e fret white inhabitants uf mat
State, at the time of ihe Convention, wcte made
voters within the Stale wnht ut rtgatd to cur na-
turalization 'avs He might be mistaken, but
such was his mpiession of tne facts Could any
body, or any power m this countiy, say that that
Constitution was void' Did it conflict with any
powers delegated to tins Government?
But for a moment, and n  did not intend to pro
tract the discussion, let them look at the condition
in which a State might be p'aced, and in which, it
a certa n period of our history, the States v o íld
have been placed, 11 this power had existed m the
Federal Government, and i s voice could have con
trolled the quatifications oí votéis for officers of
the State Governments At one tune, during the
existence of the old alien law, the Pies dejt oí th 
United States was authorized to remove, aliens
from this Union—to order (1 etr transporta-
tion beyond the Territories of the United States
At another period, a long rtsidence had been
required, to enab e aliens to bj naturaliz-d
under this Government By the natural za
tion law of '95, five years' residence was the limi1,
but by the law of '98—that period which a mo t
distinguished individual of this country once, in
his hearing, n, n therplace, (referring to the House
of Representa ive',) proaouncet hard, unconstitu
tional tniKs—a re^id"tce of fiurteen years was
lequired to enable a foreigner to become a cit zen
Such, then, hal been th  practical exercise of pow
er by this Government, over the matter of citizen-
ship of the United States And sull no man wc uld
question that tt s v as but a famt exerc se of the
power, m its plenary ex stence, this Government
misht repeal oil tre naturalization laws, and leave
the ftieigner forever unable to become a citizen
c f tin United Sta es, and consequently, according
to the Sena or's position, iiom ever becom
ing a voter m any State in the Union Was
it true thpt bis Goveirnrent held thst power
over the States, and that the States tonld pot, for
all practical ptirp sts, citi/en "e emigrants' It
v,as not true Tmy could p tsctibe, enher in th  if
sovereign or legislative capacity, the terms on
which a man wao to hold real esta'e, not only, but

evil must be firsf ducovrr J, ai d where it vvould

Tre people have the right to prescribe their own
pil cy, at d to judge cf their own ¡safety He had
now said all h  intended to say in reference to the
power to prescribe the qualification of voters, and
w.th a single reply to a very playfal rsmark of the
lionorab'e Senator, he would close The hoaora-
b'e Senator said that as a deleated party—as a retir-
ing Administration, it was indecorous and improper
in the friends of this Administration to bring forward
any new measures, or to adopt any new steps of
policy Wei!, t! at he (Mr Wrioht) believed,
and he had intended, in his heart, to be just as mo-
dest as possible for the >-hort remaining period in
whic'i his pol t tal friends were to hold powei m
that body, if they held ¡t then—to do what he be-
lieved the interests of the country required should
be done, and >-trict'y to refrain from doing what he
did not behtie to be necessary The bill before
tht Se tale—and it was but the opinion of a single
indtv ¡dual- he considered as part of a policy adopt-
ed and ¡ursued by the Congress of the United
Sta es nearly evei ince he had had the honor of a
seat in ihit body, or, at most, it was but a modifi-
cation oí that policy He view ed it in that light,
and he entreated the friends of the com ng m Ad-
m m tration not to Iook upon him as attempting to
tread in the steps of thpt powerful party.
Suppo e, ho we vet, the honorable Senator's ex-
aggeratioiii \iere real, and that they were attempt-
ing, at this late peaod of their political power, to in-
troduce new and unproved measures of principle or
policy, it would seem to him that the opportunity to
efieet a remedy was so near,that that pure and clear
'%'it, which was to '■hmp, on the 5th of March
nex , over all th " happy Unit n, could prevent any
grc it evi , vnle if, turn any mrtive, proper or
unnrtier, they houl malie a sad mistake, as
p rli ic \\ ] a ti ai s, it v ust be re «-embered that all
1 arti us did not deepiy regret such misfortunes,
when idling apon thtir opponrnts If however,
it <houM hapi n tint tSis m nsute runs across the
polit r oí tr-- tomirg Adminis rat od, and yet that
a heavy respon bum mly be devolved upon
those who feel c mpelkd to act mits repeal, then
complaint might not only bt expected, but received
wnh ínlulgentt In that aspsct < f the ca^e, he
cou'd leel no disp sttion to recriminate upon the
hoioiabc Sena or Such would have been his
