RELIEF OF LOYAL INDIANS.
Mr. WILKINSON asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a joint reso-
lution (S. No. 49) for the relief of the loyal por-
tion of the Creek, Seminole, and Chickasaw In-
dians; which was read twice. It proposes to
empower the Secretary of the Interior to apply so
much of the funds ot the Creek, Seminole, and
Chickasaw Indians as may, in his judgment, be
necessaiy to lclieve the immediate necessities of
the loyal portion of these several nations who
have been driven from their homes m consequence
of their loyalty, and provides that such expendi-
tures shall be regarded as legal and valid as if made
in accordance with the usage of the Department.
Mr.DOOLITTLE. I would ask the unanimous
consent of the Senate to have that resolution put
upon its passage.
Mr. WILKINSON. This resolution is to au-
thorize theSecietary of thelntenor to applysuch
funds as belong to these seveial tribes to relieve
tlu loyal poitionof the tribes which have been
dr-ven fiom their homes and are now in Kansas.
I have a letter from the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, which I will read,as it explains the whole
thing
Leavknwohtii. January 31. 1332.
Hon. C. I>. Smith, Sccrctfnj of the Interior
J a> rived here to d.i}. having been deiauicd on the load*
hy the Mcknoss of my wile, and mi-^iiur connections, i
find our alia as m a much wor^e condition than I antici-
pated ; seveial thousand Indians have been d> iven outot the
Indian tciutoiy. and aic now in tiic e-outh part ot Kansas
in a wictched'condiuon. hein  hteialiy without food or
clothing. Superintendent Coffin has on his own responsi-
bility-invested several thousand dollars for their relief mxt of
the lunds in his hands, and General Himterhas,sent to mem'
several wagon loads of provisions. Now what shall I do?
There is very little funds that is applicable to this case, not
enough to meet the amount already expended, and yet it
will not do to let those people, whose misfortunes have
been brought upon thein'm consequence of their loyalty,
starve and freeze to death. There is great justice in using
the funds of the whole tribe to relieve the necessities of
the Union portion of it; yet I do not see how I can do so
legally, except by authority of Congress, as the payment
would not be made in a regular way. There is a balance
left of the $50,000 appropriated last winter for destitute In-
dians, and that is all that is specially applicable. Will you
advise me immediately what is legal and proper for me to
do ? I pi efer that you telegraph me, as I shall be in consid-
erable suspense until I have your advice; and yon wiUalso
please lay the case before the President, and the chairman
of the Indian Committee. Accoiding to the best informa-
tion! can get, thcie are some five thousand of these starving
Indians alicady in Kansas, and more arriving dailv. If this
weiean ordinary case,as to nuinbcis and amount of suffer-
ing, I would take the responsibility of providing for xt with-
outtroublingyou with it; butitis very extraordinary. These
people have been robbed of every particle of their property
and driven from home.
1 send this direct to you to avoid any delay in its reach-
ing you that might by possibility occur in its pasing through
the Indian Office. The Indians belong to some five or six
tribes, mostly of the Creeks, Scminoles, and Cliickasaws,
***********
Yours very tiuly, WILLIAM P. DOLE.
The idea of this resolution is to make this a
regular and legal payment, it being made to a por-
tion of the Indians. Part of them are disloyal,
and have turned against the Government, and
these Indians have been driven from their homes.
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution was
considered as in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. If my honorable friend
will allow me, I have before mo a letter from the
Secretary of the Interior on the same subject, and
I think it is the Choctaws of which he speaks,
and not the Chickasaws.
Mr. WILKINSON. It is in the letter that they
arc " mostly of the Creeks, Seminolcs, and Chick-
asaws. " I suppose it would be as well perhaps
to put the Choctaws in, as the Secretary, on this
resolution, will not expend any more than is
necessary. I move to amend the resolution by
inserting Choctaws also.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Now let the resolution be
read as amended.
The Secretary read it.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I had drawn up a joint
resolution on this same subject, based on the sug-
gestion of the Secretary of the Interior, which is
before me, and perhaps the language ofÂ«it would
more clearly meet the views of the Secretary of
the Interior than the one now before the Senate,
and perhaps my honorable friend will accept this
as a substitute:
Resolved by the Senate, (the House of Representatives
concuning,)'That the Secretary of the Inteiior be author-
ized to pay out ot the annuities payable to the Seminoles,
Crook?, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, and whieh have not
been paid in conscqucnco of the cessation of intcicourse
with these tribes, so much oi the same as may be necessary
to be applied to the relief of *ueh portions of said tribes as
have lemamcd loyal to the United States, and have been,
oi may he rluven from their homes in the Indian Territory
into the State of Kansas or elsewhere.
Mr. WILKINSON. That will have precisely
the same effect. I have no objection to the sub-
stitute if it will suit the chairman of the Commit-
tee on Indian Affairs any better.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator ac-
cepts it as a modification. There having been no
vote of the Senate upon it, he has authority to do
so.
Mr. HALE. I noticed that as the Senator from
Wisconsin read it, the enacting part of that reso-
lution is not m the form prescribed by the Con-
stitution.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution will
be put in the usual form.
Mr. HALE. Very well.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate,
ordered to be engrossed and read the third time;
it was read the third time, and passed. Its title
was amended so as to read: a joint resolution for
the relief of the loyal portion of the Creek, Sem-
inole, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Indians.
