military organization. To agree to the proposition of Strickland would be the inauguration of a policy anything but humane. Its cruelty to the soldiers of the Confederacy now in the field, its cruelty to the cause in which we are engaged, forbid its acceptance. Your proclamation of the 18th instant offers everything to these men which the major-general commanding can conscientiously consent to in the way of leniency and pardon. With this understanding of the views of the major-general commanding, he feels confident you will proceed with such means as are at your control to act vigorously against these outlaws, leaving no efforts to capture, kill, or disperse them unemployed. While the difficulties in the way of accomplishing this end are admitted to be numerous, your energy, skill, and experience will, in the opinion of the major-general commanding, enable you to rid the country of this band, or at least to afford entire protection to the people on the border, whose interests are those of the Government.

The major-general commanding directs me to request that you forward as soon as practicable a copy of the communication of the 26th instant from Lieutenant-Colonel Capers to Strickland, to which the latter's letter seems to be a reply.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel R. H. ANDERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

COLONEL: There appears to be some ground for a suspicion that the enemy has weakened his force in Jacksonville lately, and the major-general commanding is desirous of feeling him a little, in the hope of eliciting some information on this point. For this purpose he desires that you organize a reconnaissance, in such force as you may consider advisable, to be made as early as convenient. Should you think an additional infantry support necessary, you will notify me what force you require, and at the same time communicate any information in regard to your proposed movement that may be requisite for the major-general commanding to possess.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel W. B. TABB,

Commanding, Waldo:

COLONEL: Two boats, supposed to contain troops, came down the river to Jacksonville last night. The major-general commanding directs that you make a reconnaissance immediately, with the view of ascertaining the condition of affairs at Palatka, and advise him promptly of the result.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
