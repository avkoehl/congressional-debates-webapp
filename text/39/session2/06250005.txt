APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
39th Cong....'2d Sess.
Beport of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Ho. of Reps.
promise, which, although evincing increased
liberality, has not been accepted by the United
States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in
Europe, and the present seems to be a favor-
able time for an assertion by Congress of the
principle, so long maintained by the exec-
utive department, that naturalization by one
State fully exempts the native-born subject of
any other State from the performance of mili-
tary service under any foreign Government, so
long as.he does not voluntarily renounce its
rights and benefits.
In the performance of a duty imposed upon
me by the Constitution, I have thus submitted
to the representatives of the States and of the
people such information of our domestic and
foreign affairs as th.e public interests seem to
require. Our Government is now undergoing
its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer
is, that the peril may be successfully and finally
passed, without impairing its original strength
and symmetry. The interests of the nation
are best to be promoted by the revival of fra-
ternal relations, the complete obliteration of
our past differences, and the reinauguration of
all the pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts
to the early accomplishment of these great
ends, let us endeavor to preserve harmony be-
tween the coordinate departments of our Gov-
ernment, that each in its proper sphere may
cordially cooperate with the other in securing
the maintenance of the Constitution, the pres-
ervation of the Union, and the perpetuity of
our free institutions.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
Washington, December 3, 1866.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Treasury Department,

In conformity with the requirements of law,

lowing report:
In his report under date of the 4th of Decem-

to the data furnished him by this Department
and by the other Departments, that the ex-
penditures of the Government for the three
quarters of the fiscal year ending June 30,1866,
would exceed the receipts $112,194,947 20.
The result was widely different. The receipts
exceeded the estimates $89,905,905 44; the
expenditures fell short of the estimates $200,-
529,235 30. The following statement exhibits
