GENERAL: Your letters of the 8th and 9th instant are just received. The Secretary of War must have reached Savannah by the 9th or 10th, and I presume has decided all questions asked in your communications.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

HILTON HEAD, January 15, 1865.

General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

Howard, with the Seventeenth Army Corps, crossed at Port Royal night before last without opposition. He had a skirmish a few miles out from the ferry. He expected to encamp at Pocotaligo last night. No news from him this morning. The Secretary is here and thinks he will start for Morris Island and the North this evening. I will go as far as Morris Island. The Fifty-fifth Massachusetts Colored were sent to Thunderbolt before the order to remain at Pocotaligo reached General Hatch. Shall I send and bring them back or suffer it to remain at Thunderbolt for the present?

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General.

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: The enemy abandoned his strong works in our front during the night. General Blair's corps now occupies a strong position across the railroad and covering all approaches to Pocotaligo. He has been directed to communicate with your forces. The boats had arrived at Port Royal Ferry when I passed, but not the rest of the bridge.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
