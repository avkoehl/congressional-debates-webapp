MEMORIAL OF DUFF GREEN.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee on Print-
ing, to whom was referred the motion to print
the memorial of Duff Green on the^ subject
of the national debt, currency, banking, and
finance, have instructed me to report in favor
of the motion, and to ask for its consideration
now.
The motion to print was agreed to.
Mr. THAYER. I move to reconsider the
vote by which the memorial of Duff Green was
ordered to be printed. I do not think we are
called upon to print that paper.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the motion to reconsider.
The motion was agreed to.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion recurson the motion to print the memorial.
Mr. THAYER. I simply desire to say that
I hope the Senate will not order the printing
of such communications, and I do not think
that one should be singled out, especially from
Duff Green, to receive consequence from being
printed by the Senate.
Mr. HO WARD. I should like to hear some
explanation of this report of the Committee
on Printing in favor of printing this memorial.
Mr. ANTHONY. As the Senate are aware,
it is not the custom of the Committee on Print
ing to recommend the printing of memorials-;
but it was represented to us by several Sen-
ators that this memorial contained a great deal
of valuable information that would be of use
ia discussing the subject of finances, and upon
their recommendation the committee advised
that the Senate should print it. It will cost
about fifty dollars to do it. There are some
tables accompanying it which are represented
to us to be very valuable and useful in the dis-
cussion. Of course it is impossible for us to
read every document the printing of which is  
submitted to us, and me must pay some regard
to the information of those who do know about
the contents of the papers.
Mr. CONNESS. It is not a question of
fifty dollars. It is a question of whether a
paper sent in here by a rebel, giving us advice
as to what we shall do upon public affairs, shall
be ordered to be printed, while the ablest men
of this country are engaged constantly in writ-
ing pamphlets and sending them to us at their
own expense upon the subject. Now, sir, I
hope that this man will be permitted to priut
his advice, and then he can have the privilege
of sending it here, but that the rule will not be
established of printing the memorial of every
person who sees fit to send one here, and of
his class particularly.
Mr. DIXON. As I presented the memo-
rial at the request of General Green, and made
a motion to print, which was my own motion,
I propose to say a word in reply to the Sen-
ator from California. With regard to General
Green being a rebel, I know nothing. He
may have been or may not. I never heard
and do not know. But I take it a rebel has a
right to petition. I did not know that the
right to petition was confined to any class of
men in this country.
But the Senator says it takes the form of
advice. I do not understand it to be advice
at all; and the reason why I moved to print it
was this: I found, in reading the document,
that it contained information which seemed
to me of very great value upon the important
question of the financesâ€”information which I
do not know can be obtained anywhere else,
at any rate, without very great labor, and I
thought it would be a valuable document; that
it would well pay for printing; that the inform-
ation contained in it ought to be spread before
the Senate and before the country. Therefore
I made the motion. I care nothing about it.
I feel no interest whatever in it.
Mr. THAYER. The honorable Senator
from Californiaanticipated my remarks entirely
as to the reasons which induced me to move
the reconsideration. He i3 correct, as I am
informed by other Senators, in characterizing
this Green as a notorious sympathizer with the
rebellion during the war; and I do not think
we are called upon to recognize him to th e
extent of publishing his voluntary communi-
cations to this Senate. He has been writing
these communications for some time back,
from before the flood almost, I believe,
[laughter,] and I do not think they are of
such an instructive character that they should
be entitled to be printed at public expense. I
move to lay the whole subject on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. THAYER asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 954) amending the preemption and home-
