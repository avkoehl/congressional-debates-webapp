CHARTER OF VESSELS, ETC.
Mr. COVODE. I wish to say to the House
that tiie Committee on Public Expenditures have
for some time had under consideration the subject
of frauds committed in the charter of vessels for
the use of the Government, and they have author-
ized me to report a bill upon that subject. 1 will
state that upon examining into the matter we find
that quite a number of vessels have been chartered
at one price and furnished for the use of the Gov-
ernment at another and a much larger price. We
have taken testimony upon the subject on board
of vessels, and we find that in this way extensive
frauds have been perpetiated upon the Govern-
ment. I have consulted the Quartermaster Gen-
eral, who has prepared this bill, and he has held
up a large sum of money claimed to be due for
vessels chartered under these circumstances. 1
have shown this bill to the Secretary of War, who
has filled it up with the proper officer to take testi-
mony upon the subject.
The SPEAKER.' Does the gentleman desire
to introduce the bill?
Mr. COYODE. I do.
Mr. HOLM AN. For what purpose?
Mr. COYODE. To put it on its passage. I
will state that the payment of a large sum of
money has been stopped at the Department, and
it is necessary that there should be immediate
action upon the bill.
Mr. COX. I will not object to the introduction
of the bill, if the gentleman will allow it, with the
testimony he has taken, to be printed, so that we
may vote upon it intelligently. If he has taken
testimony, he surely ought to have it printed.
Mr. COYODE. The testimony to which I
have referred was not taken by the committee on
the conduct of the war, but by the Committee on
Public Expenditures.
Mr. HICKMAN. I must object to the report
being made at this time.
Mr. COYODE. I ask Ifeave, then, to have the
bill printed.
Leave was granted, no objection being made.
Mr. HICKMAN. I move that the House ad-
journ.
The motion was not agreed to.
FINAL ADJOURNMENT.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I submit^the following
privileged resolution:
Resolved, (the Senate concurring,) That the Congress
adjourn on Monday, the 16th ot'June, 1862.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Michigan. That is no
privileged resolution. I object.
The SPEAKER. The Chair the other day
indicated his opinion that such a resolution did
not involve a privileged question, but the House
decided to receive it as a privileged question; the
Chair will therefore entertain the resolution.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I call for the previous
question upon its adoption.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put.
The resolution was adopted.
DISTRICT JAIL, PENITENTIARY, ETC.
Mr. STEYENS. I move that the rules be sus-
pended, and that the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended; and the Houcs
accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Strat-
ton in the chair,) and proceeded to the consid-
eration of House bill No. 470, to authorize the
Secretary of the Interiors in conjunction with the
mayors of Washington and Georgetown, to locate
and contract for the construction of a penitentiary,
jail, and house of correction in the District of
Columbia.
Mr. PIKE addressed the committee on the sub-
ject of the reciprocity treaty [His speech will be
published m the Appendix.] .t
Remarks general in their nature were then made
by Messrs. WARD, COX, and WHALEY.
[Their remarks will be published in the Appen-
dix.]
Mr. McPHERSON obtained the floor, but
yielded to
Mr. HOLMAN, who moved that the commit-
tee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Kellogg, of
Illinois, having taken the chair as Speaker pro
tempore, Mr. Strattok reported thattheCommit-
tee of the Whole on the state of the Union had,
according to order, had theUnion generally under
consideration, and particularly House bill No.
470, relative to the construction of a jail, peniten-
tiary, and house of correction for tiie District of
Columbia, and had come to no conclusion thereon.
PURCHASE OF ANNALS OF CONGRESS, ETC.
Mr. HUTCHINS. I ask the consent of the
House to introduce the following resolution, for
the purpose of reference to the Committee on
Printing:

IN SENATE.,
Wednesday, June 4,1862.
Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. Dr. Sunderland.
The Secretary proceeded to read the Journal of
yesterday.
Mr. HALE. I move that the reading of the
Journal be dispensed with.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no ob-
jection, the reading of the Journal will be dis-
pensed with. The Chair hears no objection.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to correct a state-
ment made by me in my remarks on the 9th of
May in regard to the Ohio volunteers. In vindi-
cating the seventy-first regiment of Ohio volun-
teers, I made this statement:
" It is cliaiged that the colonel, at the first fire of the en-
emy, left the field, and was not seen by his regiment duiing
the battle."
Injustice to the officer, whom I know person-
ally and whom I esteem highly, I feel bound to
say that recent official papers, and especially the
statement of Colonel Mason himself, certified to
by the officers of-the regiment, relieve him from
the imputation which I quoted. I did not intend
to sanction it by my quoting it; but now, in order
to do justice to Colonel Mason, I feel bound to say
that the published statement made by him shows
that he remained with his regiment and performed
his duty on that day. 1 will also state that the
official documents, which I had not then before
me, but have since seen, do not sustain the charge
I quoted.
EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Senate
a report of the Secretary of the Interior, commu-
nicating, in compliance with a resolution of the

which, on motion of Mr. Wilson, of Massachu-
