Lieutenant W. F. Harrison, Company A; Sergeant-Major Tansid and Color-Sergeant Mays, both wounded, and both of whom had distinguished themselves in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines; First Sergt. William Apperson, Company C, who was killed,and Private George Watson, Company F, who has also repeatedly distinguished himself for bravery, all of the Seventh Virginia Regiment. Captain James Mitchell, Company C, and Lieutenant Logan S. Robins, Company B, First Virginia Regiment, both of whom were wounded. Lieutenant W. R. Abbott, Company E, and Lieutenant E. T. Dix, Company K, Eleventh Virginia, both of whom were killed. Lieutenant Calfee, Company G, of the Twenty-fourth Virginia, who was killed within a few paces of the enemy's battery, and Captains Bentley and Nowlin, of the same regiment. I doubt not there are many others omitted in the reports who equally distinguished themselves. The lists of killed and wounded are made up of the very best officers and men of which my command could boast.
