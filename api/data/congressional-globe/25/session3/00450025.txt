apply, he had hoped that the gentlemen who
opposed it the last session would withdraw their
objections i this, and that the bill would be passed
without this amendment As, however, some of
the ftietias of the bill still entertained the same
objections to this lowest i eduction, he should not
now occupy the time of the session in discussing
its piop ltty, though the amendment operated
with fpcuhir haidships in some sections of the
new States, and paiticularly m his own He
agieed with his fnend fiom Mississippi, that if
theie was any hope of getting a final decision on
the bill by both Houses befoie the close of this
session, it was impoitant that the action of this
body upon it should be a speedy one and he in
dulled the hope that, inasmuch as the bill had
been passed by a large majority at the last ses-
sion, after an able and full discussion, that the
amendment would be disposed of, and the bill
passed now
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, íemarked that he
came to the benate this morning with no expect-
ation that this measuie, fraught with such incon-
ceivable importance to the public interests, would
occupy their attention to day, and he therefore
came without any sort of pieparation for its dis-
cussion He was not in the habit at any time,
not was it his purpose on thisoe <ision, to throw
any impediments in the way of a bill, so as to
deteat a fair «onsideration of it by both Houses,
but still he thought that a measure of this nature
should not be acted on without some time being
allowed for prepaiatory consideiation His im-
pressions as to the impolicy of disturbing the
existing land system, and still more as to the im-
policy of changing the price of the public lands,
were well known to the Senate and to the public
still he should have liked a further oppoitunity
for consideiation on this important measure,and
foi expressing his \iews with regard to it He
was awaie that the subject had been fully dis
cussed at the last session, and that the body, with
but few changes, was the same now as then, and
with r< spect to them a repetition of the discussion
was not impoitant, still he thought theie could
not be imposed on this great question too anxious
a consideiation, and he therefore hoped that it
would not be pressed now
Mr C then moved that the bill be postponed to,
and made the order of the day for, "Vionday next
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, said that he would
not object to the postponement, but for the fact
that the bill had been so íecently and so fully
discussed, and was so thoroughly jndeistood by
evei y member of the body It had been not only
fully discussed in both Houses of Congiess at the
last session, but had undeigone a considerable
discussion in the public papéis tlnoughout the
countiy The honorable Senator himsi If had been
heard in opposition to it, and, though he wished
for fuithes discussion, he had not intimated that
he had any new views to offer, or could throw
further light on the subject It dn! seem to him
that, as the bill had been lost at the last session
only from want of time for action on it in both
Houses, its fnends could not consistently consent
to delay it now He would not, he repeated,
object to the postponement asked for, if he ex
pected the gentleman to throw any new light on
the subject, but as the measure was one of \ital
importance to the new States, and especially to
the one he repiesenttd, he could not, undci the
circumstances he had adverted to, and he hoped
the friends of the bill would not, consent to its
postponement
The question was then taken on Mi Clay's
motion, and it was carried so that the bill was
postponed to, and made the order of the day foi,
Monday next
The bill for the relief of the hens of lohn Bra
ban, late receivei of public moneysat Huntsviile,
Alabama, was taken up and considered as in Com
nnttee of the "Whole, and, after being explained
and advocated by Mi CLAY, of Alabama, was
oideied to be engiossed for a third reading
The following bills were also read the second
time, and considered as in Committee of the
Whole, and ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading
The bill for the relief of William Jones, and
The bill to establish an additional land office m
ti e State of Alabama
After the consideration of executive business,
the Senate adjourned
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, Decembei 12, 1838
The first business in order was, the considera-
tion of the i evolutions introduced yesterday by
Mr  Atherton
As soon, however, as the Joilrnat was read,
Mr WISE rose and remarked that he did not
perceive entered on the record the fact that he had
refused to vote yesterday and, as he wanted his
constiiuents to see that he had not entertained the
subject of abolition of slavery in the States, he
moved that the Journal be corrected accordingly
The motion was disagreed to
Mi WISE inquiied if this motion would hot
go on the Journal of to day'
The SPEAKER lepbed that it would
Mr  WISE'S object was attained, then.
Mr CAMPBELL, of Tennessee, uiquned if it
would be in ordei then to move a reconsideration
of the vote for the previous question
The SPEAKER was of opinion that it would
not, as the vote was in progress of being taken
The second resolution was then read, as fol-
lows
Resohed, Pliat petitions for the abolition of slaverv m
the District of Columbia and the "I erntones of the Lmted
Sidles, and against the removal oí  l ives from one S ue to
mother are A parr of a plan of opi ration  set on foot to
affect the institution of Maverj in the sever U State , and
thus indirectly to destroy that institution within their limits
Mi BIDDLE asked permiss on to decline
voting on the second proposition, as wantonly
stigmatizing a mass of men While he could not
vote for it, he knew the reckless audacity with
which a vote against it might be used to eieate a
false impression Mi B referred to the stand he
had taken in his own distncton this sulject,and
the manner in which he had been sustained His
Vm Buren opponent had lefused to answer the
interrogatories propounded Mi B thought that
a body of honoiable men ought not to place him
in this filse light for the meit, transient purposes
of party, with a view to influence the elections
at the South, now that those at the Noith had
been got tinough with Mr B was pioceeding
further, but
The SPE AKER interposed, on the giound that
the gentleman was transgressing the rules
The House lefused to excuse Mr   P>iddle
The question was then taken on the second
resolution, and it was adopted—yeas 136, nays

Mr WISE, when his name was called,said I
refuse to vote
Mr GUSHING- raised the question of order,
that the gentleman was bound to vote unless
excused, and that, as the names must be called 1
alphabetically, the Clerk could not pioceed to the
next name and pass o\er that of Mi   Wjsf
The SPEAKER said the point had heen de
cided before, the ioII must be pioceeded with,
after being once commenetd
Mr CUSHING gave notice that he should
laise the question agajn.
Mr BRONSON, who stated that he was mo~
I mentaiily absent from his seat when his name
I was calleu, asked ltaxe to recoid his name in the
I affirmative, but leave was not giented
I As soon as the toll was gone through, and be-
' fore the vote was announced,
Mi CUSHliNG again raised the above ques
tion, but it was ruled to be out of older
The third resolution was then read, as follows
Rcsoh e ¡, Tint Congress has no right to do that indirectly
winch it cannot do directly, and tint the agitation of the
subject of slaver) in the District ot Columbia, or the Tern
tone  as a means, and with the view, ol disturbing Or over-
throwing ill it mslitution in the several States, is against
the true spirit and meaning of the Constitution, an infringe-
ment oí the rights of the Slates affected, and a breach of
the public faith upon which they entered into the Coufed
eracy
Mr BO is ¡J called for a division of the ques-
tion, so as to take the vote fiist on the folk wing
bianch only
Resolved I h it Congress lias no right to do that indirectly
winch it cannot do directly
The vote being so teken, resulted in the affirm-
ativi—yeas 173, nays 30, as follows.

So the first branch of the third resolution was
adopted
The second branch being read,
Mr GARLAND, of Louisiana, inquired if the
I mover himself could modify this resolution >
I     The SPEAKER said he could not after the
I House had seconded the previous question upon
it
1     Mr G VRLAND, of Louisiana    Could he not
do it by the unanimous consent of the House'
The bPE 1KER     Certainly
Mr GARLAND, of Louisiana, asked if, but
it was objected to
Mr  WISE called for sueh a division of the
question as would, in  the firot instance, omit
, the sentence after the word "Columbia " to the
I word " States," in the sixth line
The SPEAKER said the proposition was not
I susceptible of such a division, because that sen-
| tence could not stand by itself as a substantive
i proposition
1     The question was then taktn,and resulted also
i in the affirmative—yeas 164, nays 4t), as follows-
