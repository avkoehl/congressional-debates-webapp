MR  CALHOUN'S RESOLUTIONS
In ¿senate, Thursdiy, fanuaiy 4, 1838—The Senate
having resumed the consideration of the resolu-
tions offered by Mr Cílhovjn, il e thud ol the
series being beloie them,
Mr NORVELL rose to move that so much of
the third íesolutton of the hororable Senator from
South Carolina, (Mi Calhoun,) as pledged this
Government to give "inci cased" stabih y and secu-
rity to the domestic institutions of the States, and
as pronounced it t h- ib diuy to "strengiheii"
them, be erased from the resolution It would
then read "that tin* Governmcrt was instituted

Was it a religious duty, sir, to \ íolate tnc Con-
stitution of the United States'    Was it a religious
duty to commit a breacn of faith toward cur sister
States? Was it a religious dut} to mitigate the slaves
of the South to rise up to slaughter their owneis ,
to  perpetrate   mmder   in its  worst aspect,   the
midnight murdei, which spares neithei age noi sex,
of which female honor and helpless infancy  are
equally the victims?    Sir, this is the same religious
spirit which bound the human  body, the shrieking
mother and the innocent child, to the stake of per-
secution, and consumed them to death amid fire
and flame, for a mere difference of opinion on sec-
tarian points It was this christian spirit that
prompted civilized Europe to commence the s' ive
tiade, for the purpose of converting the pagan Afri-
can to the knowledge of the true and hvmg God
It was this religious spirit that, m the eaiher ages,
impelled half civilized Europe, in a mass as it
were, led on by fanaticism and frenzy, to engage
in crusades to the Holy Land, in order to re-con-
quer fiom heathen idolators the city of Jerusalem,
at the expense of the sufferings and blood of count-
less myriads of human beings It was, sir, a pro-
fmation of the name, an insult to the character, of
the Sivior of mankind, to call this arehgious spmt
It «as the spirit of Abolitionism It was a demo-
niac spirit, which instigates the destruction of the
enlightened half of one great section of our Union,
m the frail hope of rendering the other ignorant
and degraded Ifncan half fit subjects for the en
joyment of liberty, in the more wicked hope of ren-
dering them fit associates, companions, husbands,
and wives of our northern and northwestern women
and men of Saxon descent
He was thoioughly and unchangeably opposed
lo this entire abolition spirit We of the non-slave-
holdmjf States are fie~ from the evils of siaveiy
It is no grievance with us It is not our business
to intei meddle with it It is no part of our consti-
tutional right or duty to petition Congress on the
subject Congress have no control over it It is a
subject reserved exclusively to the respective
States w thm which slavery exists Before the
adoption of the Constitution, each State of this
Union was an independent sovereignty, with all
the rights and powers of independent nations
They aie equally so now with regard to all the
rights and powers not delegated to the federal Go-
vernment Nothing but the monstrous supposition
that tl is is a consolidate!, and not a federative Go-
vernment, could excuse oui petitions for the abo-
lition ol an evil which has no existence with us,
whu h is remote from us, which exists only m dis-
l int sistci Stales, whose citizens alone have any
right lo touch or mteifere with it
Slavery m this country was entirely a domestic
question. Congress could not touch it The States
in which slavery was still tolerated had never,
even 1 v implication, given up any poition of their
(xclisnc power over the whole subject. They
t m! I not with any regard to their own safety, per-
mit il to be diawn into question by their sister
c t ites, oi by the General Government It was
i it a sublet open to discussion with a view to le-
gislation any where but m the States rerogmsing
md suffenng the existence of slavery Nor could
Cc ngiess, in his opinion, either consti utic nally, or
c nsistently with the public fnth, abohih it in the
Distnotol Columbia, unless the people oftheDis-
tuct desued it, and pclitioncd for it The Dislnc
w is ceded to Congress by the States of Virginia and
Mirvlnnd on the condition that the rights of pri-
\ ate property, as befoi e existing, w ere to be held
- icred, and the United States received the cession
upi i that condition The power gianted to Con-
gte s, to "xercise exclu ive legislation, in all cases
uhitso"\ci, ovei the Uislnct,"conleircd no authori-
ty to % íolate the public faith, or to take from its in-
habitants their ptoperty without then consent It
simply and clearly meant, that legislative powers
could be excicis-cd by no other body than Congress
ovr the District It meant ro moie It did not
mean lhat Congress could pass any law dictated by
its arbitiary will and pleasure, in -violation of the
right of property, or of any other right asserted in
the acts of cession lo the United States If Mary
land and Virginia had imagined lhat this question
would have been here laised, they would never have
cede 1 the District He was w as no friend to slave-
ry He reprobated every appearance of it Though
bcrn in a slave State, he had, when, at the age of
n n teen lit left the paternal roof of his father, re
fused the offer of slave property made to him, and
as decidedly refused to receive the proceeds of the
sal" o such property He had, on two or three oc-
casions, subscribed money for the emancipation of
individual slaves He had, when a member of the
convention by which the Constitution of Michigan
was formed, introduced the resolution against
siaveiy, and reported the article, which was unani-
mously adopted into that Constitution, declaring
that "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
should ever be introduced into the State, except for
crimes of which the party shall have been duly
convicted " His own skirts were free from the
imputed sm of slavery , but he was not, because
opposed to domestic slavery, justified in engaging
in an unconstitutional crusade against the Southern
and sister States of Michigan, for tolerating an evil
which they did not consider as such, which was
entailed upon them, and which the compact of
union recognised their right to tolerate and to en-
dure. He was not justified in urging Congress to
violate that sacred compact, to put an end to the
peace and integrity of the Union, for the suppres-
sion of an alleged moral sin, from which he and
his fellow-citizens of Michigan were entirely ex-
empt, and for w Inch they were m nowise more
responsible than they were for the oppressions
under which the subjects of Great Britain in India
or Ireland suffered and groaned It was only upon
the absurd assumption that the General Govern-
ment was a consolidated National Government,
possessing all power within and over the States,
that any interference on its part in this subject
could be contemplated He had no hesitation in
affirming that such an idea had never seriously en-
tered the minds of the framers of the Constitution,
and that any interference of the kind would extin-
guish all hope of the peVpetuation of the Union
And what would the Abolitionists gain by a
result so disastrous to their efforts? Sir, not a
slave- would they emancipate Their fanatical ex-
ertions would thiow back for fifty years every hope
of emancipation Disunion, dissension, and civil
war, would ensue And would they in that case
take up arms to wage war upon the South' Would
they enter the armies of the North, even to defend
its soil, in case of Southern aggression1 Would
the non-combatant abolition clergy, the feeble wo-
men and children, who swell the lists ol abolition
petitioners, draw the sword for us of the North and
the Northwest, in the event of a civil war, brought
upon us by their gratuitous and maudlin shouts tor
negro emancipation'' What atonement could they
make to their suffering country for its Union split
to pieces—for its villages and towns laid in ashes
—for its safety undone—for its fields laid w aste—
for the seas of human blood shed in the unholy
and terrific civil strife, whichlthey had instigated to
effect tha abolition ot slavery in distant States'2
Sir, there is no foretelling the extent to which fa-
naticism, assuming the sacred garb of religion,
will carry its deluded victims The Abolitionists
commenced with petitions for the abolition of sla-
very m the District of Columbia, then they peti
tioned for the abolition of slavery in the Territo-
ries , now they are demanding the prohibition oí
the trade between the States, and their next step
w 11 be to íequire Congress to usurp the pow-
er to suppress slavery in ths Southern States
And all this they do in the name of humani-
ty' Their humanity only rivets the chains
of slavery still tighter. It only divests the
slave of all hope, and goads h s Soudiern owner,
foimerly and naturally inclined to loosen the
bands, to a more resolute determination to main-
tain the mastery over him, without any relaxation
He had heaid much said about the right of petition
as in danger of violation from the passage of these
resolutions What was the right of petition, ao
guarantied by the Federal Constitution' It was
simply that Congress should pass no law prevent-
ing the people from assembling to petition for a
redress of their grievance . Was slavery in dis-
taat States a grievance to the people of the Norfh
and the Northwest' If it was, the Federal Consti-
tution, the Federal Union, was to them a grie-
vance' Did the resolutions propose any such law
as to prohibit assemblages of the people to petition
for any grievance of their own, or for any
grievance not their own' Did they propose any
tning like if? But the liberty of the press and of
speech was in danger' The assertion was destitute
ol all foundation What was daily going on here,
what was daily going on in all the Northern States,
demonstrated the idle nature of the allegation.
The resolutions left the freedom of speech and of
the piess where the Constitution placed  them
