General R. S. GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala.:

I have dates from Memphis of the 4th. General A. J. Smith has started out from Memphis for Columbus, Miss., with 10,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, and will come to Decatur, Ala., from there. You may expect him. Give me any rumors that reach you from that quarter.

It is important that the forces of your command that can possibly be spared should be immediately sent to General Sherman, near Atlanta.

General WASHBURN,

Memphis:

After General Smith reaches Columbus he should march for Decatur, Ala., and thence report to me. I propose to send back the cavalry and all but the regiments that belong to General Smith's old DIVISION, and the fragments that belong to the SIXTEENTH and Seventeenth Corps. We cannot spare the force for Mobile and must be content with a feint, which Canby must make. Let General Smith impress on the people the fact that as long as Forrest lives their country is doomed to be harassed, and let him take freely of all food and forage and remount his men always. Now that General Slocum is promoted, and you have the whole of MISSISSIPPI to manage, you can better economize the use of troops. Is Forrest surely dead? If so, tell General Mower I am pledged to him for his promotion, and if Old Abe don't make good my promise then General Mower may have my place.
