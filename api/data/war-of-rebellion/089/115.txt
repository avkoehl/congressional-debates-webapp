Major-General WEITZEL:

Birney reports that he easily repulsed the enemy on his right, but that Pickett's and Field's divisions are going still farther to his right. If I take the offensive, what force can you spare to hold Birney's left?

Relieve as much of William Birney's [line] as you can. He is on your left. I believe that most of the force has been withdrawn from your front. I do not know any new troops that have come over.
