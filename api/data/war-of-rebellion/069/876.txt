HDQRS. DEPT. OF N. CAROLINA AND SOUTHERN VA.,June 5, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: General Winder having been relieved from command of the Second Military District of this department, I have the honor to request that a competent officer of proper rank be ordered to report to me, to be placed in command of that important district, which embraces Weldon, Goldsborough, Kinston, Plymouth, Washington, and other important points in the State of North Carolina. I would respectfully suggest that this be done with as little delay as possible, as serious difficulties might result from the absence of such an officer in the above-named district.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
