By command of the Secretary of War:

JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, Knoxville, February 10, 1863.

Colonel EWELL,Assistant Adjutant-General:

I inclose you a document from Brigadier-General Marshall,* which has arrived since I assumed command of this department. I respectfully ask that it be forwarded to General Joseph E. Johnston, for his consideration and instructions in the matter. Having just entered on my duties, and having no knowledge of the causes inducing the order, I have not thought proper to take action until properly advised.

I would further state respectfully, for the information of the general commanding, that, as far as my investigations have gone, I find the army here in the worst possible condition, on the score of discipline and efficient military government; no returns made, no reports of brigades, &amp;c., giving data upon which reliable returns made, no reports of brigades, &c., giving data upon which reliable returns can be made and forwarded to headquarters; great complaint in getting the necessary forage. The disloyal spirit of East Tennessee seems not to have been improved by the lenient course hitherto pursued. I am of the opinion more stringent measures should be adopted. I would advise that a reliable force be at once placed in the field, and conscript all persons of the proper age, and the disaffected disloyal portion be sent to our army in the extreme south, and their places supplied by troops from the south. In this way you rid East Tennessee of a population that always has and will give aid and comfort to our enemies. I would advise, further, that some of the prominent leaders be arrested, put in prison, and held as hostages to such men as Judge Marchbanks, of Middle Tennessee. The suggestions are furnished for the consideration of General Johnston, and such action taken as his better judgment may suggest.

Respectfully, yours,

D. S. DONELSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Department.
