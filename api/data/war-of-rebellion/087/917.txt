MAJOR: Colonel Goode, commanding Wise's brigade, thinks that the movement of troops observed yesterday evening was nothing more than a relief of pickets. His officer of the day reports that Indians are on duty in front of that brigade; they belong to the Ninth Corps. Several communications on the subject of ordnance have been received, and an investigation is now being made to endeavor to decrease the expenditure. A report will be made as soon as the matter is reported upon by brigade commanders.

The following casualties are reported: Gracie's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 2. Wise's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 1. Ransom's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 1.
