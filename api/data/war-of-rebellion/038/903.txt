The force at my command will enable me to prepare about thirty or forty arms per day, in ordinary or average amount of repairs. I have but few good gunsmiths or machinists, and none are to be had, since those who may be in the army are not detailed.

The laboratory will turn out about 25,000 or 30,000 cartridges per day when supplied with material. If disabled soldiers could be detailed for this latter work, and the supply of lead could be increased, the products of the laboratory would be likewise increased.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. L. WHITE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The enemy kept up incessant sharpshooting all yesterday on the left and center, and picked off our officers and men whenever they showed themselves. Their artillery fire was very heavy, and plowed up our works considerably and dismounted two guns on the center. The works were repaired and the guns replaced last night. The great question is ammunition. The men credit, and are encouraged by, a report that you are near with a large force. They are fighting in good spirits, and the organization is complete.

Very respectfully, &c.,J. C. PEMBERTON.

HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston:

Brisk musketry and artillery fire to-day on center. Three guns there dismounted will be replaced as far as possible. Officers suffer most from their sharpshooters. Incessant mortar firing from the river, and last night three of gunboats engaged the lower batteries.

Respectfully, &c.,

J. C. PEMBERTON.
HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston:

The enemy has continued a spirited fire all day; also his shelling from mortar boats. Our men have replied rarely. Two large transports came down loaded with troops. They are evidently re enforcing their present large force. Am I to expect re- enforcements? From what direction, and how soon? Have you heard anything from General Loring? Can you send me musket caps by courier?

Respectfully, &c.,J. C. PEMBERTON.

HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston:

GENERAL: During the past two days the enemy has passed up the river in transports in large force for a point not yet discovered.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
