Colonel Thoburn's report, who, with those who fought until the last with him, deserve particular mention for their gallantry.

Our loss on this occasion was 65 killed, 301 wounded, and 56 missing. I had no correct means of ascertaining the enemy's loss, but it is reasonable to suppose that it was heavier than ours.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE CROOK,

Brevet Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
