dollars and eighty four cents, ($27,528 84,) and to
the credit of the collector of the customs for the
district of Alexandna the sum of two thousand
eight hundred and nineteen aollars and thnty-four
cents, (#2,819 34 )
Tnere appears to be, however, no ground for
appreiiendmg that any part of this sum is in dan-
ger of being lost The bank, ltis understood,has
abundant means out of which the debt may be sat-
isfied, and measures will be taken to recover it, if
satisfactory security be not piomptly given by the
bank. But assurances have been given by the
cashier to the district attorney that the security
required will be placed in the possession of the
department without delay.
it is proper to add, that a few days before the
Bank of Alexandna stopped payment the sum of
$3,437 50 was deposited in the bank to the credit
of the Treasurer of the United States, by the cor-
poration of Alexandria, on account of the loan
made to the corporations of this District under the
act of May 24,1828 But as the draft of the Treas-
urer on that bank m favor of the Bank of the Me-
tropolis for this money was not paid, it is believed
that the United States are not responsible for it,
and it is therefore not included in the sum above
mentioned
The Farmers and Mechanics' Bank of George-
town had on deposite, to the credit of the Treasurer
of the United States, at the time it stopped payment,
the sum of sixty thousand dollars, (^60,000 ) But
a like sum has been advanced by that bank to the
paymaster of the Harper's Peí ry armoi y, to enable
him to pay the workmen and carry on the works
at that place, in anticipation of the regular appro-
priation. As that appropriation has now been
made, the Farmeis and Mechanics' Bank are en-
titled to receive the money they have so advanced,
so that there is nothing due from that bank, as
appears oy a copy of tne letter of the Secretary
of War, herewith transmitted
There was no public money on deposite, or
otherwise, to the credit of the Treasuier, m any of
the other banks in this District which have
recently stopped pavment.
The report of the Treasurer, hereunto annexed,
will show that §14,000, belonging to the navy pen-
sion fund, was invested in the stock of the Bank
of Washington, at the time that bank stopped
payment, and it appears by the letter of the Sec-
retary of the Wavy, herewith transmuted, that this
investment was made in the yeirs 1811 and 1817

REMARKS OF MR CRAMER,
Or IvLW  YORK,
In the House of Representatives,
wiptii 8, lb34,
On the Revolutionary Commutation Bill.
The time which this sublet has already occu-
pied the attention of the House, and the distin-
guished talent and ability with which all the pio
visions of this bill have been sustained by the
committee who reported it, admonish me that
nearly all has been said which was necessary and
propel,and that 1 ought not to trespass upon the
patience of the House by obtruding my views
upon it, conscious as I am that my proper piov-
mce is rather to listen to, and receive instruction,
than to endeavor to impart it to others But a
deep sense of the justice of these claims, a settled
conviction of the entire propnety and expediency
of the provisions of this hill, and more especially
the mannei m which it has been assailed by one of
my honorable colleagues, must be my apology for
briefly pi eventing the reasons which have contrib-
uted to the formation of my judgment, not that I
indulge the vain hope thereby to influence the
vote of a solitary member of this House, but with
a view to a cleat and succinct statement of the case
as it presents itself to my own mind I would
lnquiie, what were the services tendered by the
petitioners' And on what equitable grounds is
compensation demanded' If I have understood
these claims right'y, they aie based on the solemn
pledge of the nation, given at a crisis when it had
nothing else to pay in but its faith and its depre-
ciated credit, and made for services the most im-
portant, appalling, and  hazardous, that can  be
imagined     Yes, bn, the men for whom this bill |
pioposes compensation, enteiea and continued in
the service of the country literally with a hang- ¡
man'  noose around their necks   For what, I ask, I
would have been their condition if they had proved j
unsuccessful in the final issue'   No one need be ¡i
told that the most of them, in all human probabil-1
¡ty, would have been tned, condemned, and exe-
cuted as rebels   Congress, therefore, conscious of
this fearful exposure, and as an additional induce-
ment for them to remain in the service of their
country, promised them the little pittance of half
pay for life, on condition that they continued in
the service to the close of the war, and this was
predicated on a still more uncertain contingency,
well understood by both parties, viz    that they
should be victorious in the dreadful and unequal
contest in which they had embaiked   This agiee-
ment or contract Was consummated by a resolu-
tion of this House, recorded 21st October, 1780,
it was afterwards, in March, 1783, on the mag-
nanimous request of the officers interested, com-
muted for a much less sum than the original
amount, namely, five years' full pay in money, or
in secuiities bearing an interest of six per cent,
pei annum
Thus we have the services performed, and the
pledged compensation,  and what are the objec
tions to the fulfilment of the contract, or in other
words, to the passage of the bill under consider- i
ation'   One which was urged by my honorable [
friend from New Hampshire is, that it erects a i
new and a different tubunal to ascertain-whethei
the claimants bring themselves within the letter or I
spnit of the resolution of 1783     And is this ob-
jectionable'   I confess I listened with attention to |
the gentleman who made it, and heard no satisfac-
toiy reason assigned to sustain the objection     Is
it not evident that action on these claims would be
more uniform and expeditious if they snail be set- |
tied by the Sec rel-iry of the Treasury under a
genera! law, than if investigated and adjudicated
by a committee of this House, fluctuating and
changing as that body mu^t necessarily be' Surely
it must be admitted that the proposed arrangement
would be infinitely more just, as the same rule by
the same officer would be applied to all claimants,
with leisuie sufficient carefully and critically to
examine all the pi oof  In addition to this, it would
save much of the time of thib and the other House,
and also prevent unnecessary delay and expense
to the applicants      It would, therefore, promote
true economy, as well as expedite justice, for it
must be lecollected  and admitted that the indi-
viduals here claiming aie creditors of the Govern-
ment, and if we pay at ail, we must, or ought, to
pay interest at the rate stipulated m the resolution
to which I referred, for the entue period these set-
tlements have been leferred
Another objec  on which has been made against
the bill is, that the rule prescnbing the pioper tes
timony to substantiate the time end extent of this
service, is too fav orable to he applicants This,
however, is an assumpnon which is not war-anted
by the facts, nor by the established rules of evi-
dence, as applicable to ancient covenants But
this objection has been so fully discussed, and so
tnun phantly refuted by gentlemen who have pre
ceded me in this debate, that 1 will not tax the
patience of the House with any additional reason
to demonstiate its fallacy
The third ob]ection which has been taken to the
provisions of th>s bi1! is, that sorre may possibly j
be theieby included who have aneady received j
compensation, and perhaps othei-, who were not j
originally entitled  to any, and, therefore, it  is ^
gravely inferred, that because we may possibly do |
wiong, we must not do that which 13 clearly and j
manifestly right     This is proving too much     It |
would extend to the total ex"lusion of all legisla
Uon, for I defy human sagacity to ñame a law so
that injustice rnignt not sometimes be consequent
on its enfoi cement     But I cannot peiceive, from
the face of this law, nor fiom any legitimate rea
son which has b en presented to the considerate n I
of the House, that such consequences would neces-
sarily, or even pobably follow, unless gent'erren
are disposed  to maintain the position—which 1
regret to say some have too broadly intimated—
that these claimants weie so destitute of moial
rectitude, so sordid, so superannuated, and so in-
distinct in their reminiscences, that, in order to
effect then ownoi otheis'designs on the Treasury,
they would affirm to any statement of facts which
any artful, unprincipled scrivener might indite.
But, in chanty to the gentleman fiom New York,
who intimated this, I will not suppose that it was
seriously intended as being peculiarly applicable
to these venerated relics of our nation's pride and
boast But be it as some gentlemen will have it—
that occasional frauds may and will be practised,
still I am for the law, for I insist that these claims
are more sacred, and of a higher order, than any
i others which can be presented to the consideiation
of this House, and, for one, I hope I may be
I spared the painful retiospectofhavmgutteredany
, sentiment derogatory to the character of these
I claimants, or of having, from false notions of
I economy, withheld that which was justly due to
1 any man, who,in thatmomentousstruggle, rallied
| around the sinking standard of hiscountry Yes,
sir I conscientiously contend that it is bettei, far
I belter, m this case, that some should even receive
¡ Benjamin's portion, than that any should go un-
satisfied
| But is it correct that frauds would be more suc-
cessfully practised on a vigilant, intelligent public
officei, than on the members of this House' So
far as my expenence extends, the reverse of this
position is true I therefore maintain that if gen-
tlemen who are opposed to thi3 bill are solely
intent on carefully and honestly guarding the
Treasury, this is the pi operand most effectual mode
of doing it But, for myself, sir, lam not disposed
in this case to bar the Treasuiy of the Union, at
the hazard of doing injustice to those revolutionary
veterans who, in the most gloomy and agonizing
period of oui nation's emancipation, stood in the
front ranks in many a bloody and embattled field
No, let that eaglcd eyed vigilance to protect the
funds of the nation be reserved for a proper sub-
ject and a fit occasion, let it be rigorously observed
and enforced in all cases of doubtful constitutional
prerogative to make appropriations either on the
ground of construction, expediency, or precedent
—the most villainous and still the most successful
subterfuge heietofore resorted to, to rob your
Treasury and sap the foundations of y our Govern-
ment 1 will go all lengths with the gentlemen on
this Domt, and here I will assure them is an ample
and a glorious field for curtailment Nay, I will
go with them for retrenchment and economy on
all proper occasions But for heaven's sake let frs
not commence this system by doing an act of vio-
lence and gross injustice to the warworn veteran,
or to his lineal descendants No, sir, parsimony
here would be prodigality, foi we should be squan-
dering and dissipating that which dollars and cents
could not compensate for I mean our national
character, for I assert that it is an undeniable
proposition that these are just dues, growing out
of a national compact for services themostadven-
turous and important ever performed by man
And will any one have the hardihood to affirm,
that in this case the laborei is not worthy of his
hue, or, in other words, his piomised reward'
If any one doubts, let him estimate, if he can, the
value of our independence, of our exalted and
happy condition, as a people,contrasted with any
or all other nations on the face of the globe Nay,
'et him estimate, if possible, the value of our
Union Yes, our Union, and then let him say, if
he can, that the men who achieved this by their
valor and patient endurance of every deprivation
and danger, shall go unpaid, and be denied the
trifling bounty which was tneir due by solemn
con ract, because, forsooth, it will take a few
thousand', nay, millions, if you please, to liqui-
date and cancel tnese claims. For one, I deprecate
all such miserable miserly suggestions, such con-
tracted, sordid reasons and pay the mind that
can be infiaenced by them What1 refuse to pay
tor services, bat for which we should not now be
here, legislating in this mngn Scent Hall, foi a
great, independent, and magnanimous nation' No,
sir, we should have been spaied that proud satis-
faction, for we should still have been the humble
vassals of some foreign prince, for such a race of
pa'nots and heroes has not appeared on tha
American stage since that eventful period
Tor one, su, (said Mi   P ,) I never will besat-
fied until every man who fought and bled in the
