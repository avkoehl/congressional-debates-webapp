the Treasury Department. The money has,
therefore, been already absorbed under press-
ing need, and the cost is still going on. - A
deficiency bill of several millions to defray the
additional expenses will be brought in at the
next'session of Congress, after the presiden-
tial election.
• The actual direct outlay of money by the
Government in maintaining its military estab-
lishments at the South in the interest of the
Republican party may be set down as certainly
over twenty million dollars a year.
freedmen's bureau.
Next to the southern army in cost, and a
potent auxiliary of Radical reconstruction, is
the Freedmen's Bureau. This has become a
gigantic political machine. It was first organ-
ized under thp act of Congress of March 3.
1865, and although limited by the terms of the
original act to one year after the close of the
rebellion, it has been continued ever since.
There is nowhere to be found a full, fair, and
precise account of what has been expended to
sustain and extend it. Important omissions,
underestimates, or a blending of periods of
time in the statements of different classes of
expenditures, characterize and confuse the frag-
mentary statistics which have thus far been fur-
nished upon the subject. Enough, however,
can be gathered from official figures which have
escaped concealment to form a general estimate
of that vast expenditure which in all its details
will never be fully known or set down among
the statistics of the Government.
It is true that Congress has as yet made but
two direct appropriations of money for the
support of the Freedmen's Bureau, amounting
together to $10,780,750. But thefirstof these
appropriations was not made till July 13, 1806,
when the bureau had already been in opera-
tion on a large scale for more than a year, and
no money upon either of the appropriations
was actually drawn from the Treasury until
August, 1867, considerably more than two
years after the expenditures of the bureau
began. The explanation is this: by the pro-
visions of the act which organized the bureau
in March, 1865, it was invested with authority
to seize and appropriate for its use the aban-
doned lands in the insurrectionary States and
those to which the United States had acquired
title by confiscation or sale. It also appropri-
ated funds from various other sources of rev-
enue, as, for example, fines, taxes, retained
bounties, &c.
The bureau had been practically in existence
long before its organization in March, 1885,
under the name of the Department of Negro
Affairs, and had property and funds on hand
which were transferred to the bureau. But
the bulk of its means were supplied from
another quarter. The most important part
of the Freedmen's Bureau act, touching its
resources, is that part which authorizes the
Secretary of War to issue for the use of the
bureau unlimited supplies of provisions, cloth-
ing, and fuel, subject only to such rules and
regulations ashe might himself direct. These
supplies were accordingly furnished in lavish
profusion.
supplies op food.
During twelve months from June, 1865, to
May, 1866, the number of rations accounted
for as having been issued by the War Depart-
ment for the use of the bureau were as follows:
1865.
June  319,808
July  368,880
Aueust  802,581
September      I,io0,643
October  810.029
November  698,1295-
December    070,844-3
1866.
January  720,415!-
February  988,006
March  1.029J12
April  90S,892i
May  1,145,878
Total in twelve months.,..   ,.10,042,719 j'
At twenty-five cents a ration, which is th'e
cost as stated in the official estimates of Gen-
eral Howard, the Commissioner of the Freed-
men's Bureau, the money value of the rations
distributed from the subsistence deprrtment
of the Arrpy upon requisitions of the bureau
in one year was $2,500,879 75. For the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1867, Congress appro-
priated for this purpose alone the sum of
$3,106,250.
supplies op clothing.
But the bureau has clothed the freedmen as
well as fed them. I have not been able to
obtain any exact account of the clothing issued
from the quartermaster's department upon the
requisitions of the bureau in any one year, and
of course not of those supplies which were
issued without any requisition at all. But the
amount in the aggregate must have been very
large, as, according to Army estimates, it costs
in general more to clothe than to feed a body
of men supported by the Government.
In the report of the Commissioner of the
Freedman's Bureau of November 30, 1866, he
says, "The value of quartermaster's property,
including clothing, camp, and garrison equipage
received by the bureau previous to April 3,
1866, was $525,035 34." This valuation was
probably at the low standard of Government
sales, and does not include the large distribu-
tion in the department of negro affairs before
the bureau was organized. Some idea of the
supplies actually furnished by the War Depart-
ment under this head may be formed from the
fact that the Commissioner of the bureau in
his first annual report (to be found in House
Executive Document No. 11, first session
Thirty-Ninth Congress) estimates the supplies
of clothing needed by the bureau for distri-
bution during the year 1866 at $1,750,000, and
the commissary stores for the same year at
$4,106,250.
COMMISSIONED OFFICERS IN THE PAT OP THE UNITED
STATES EMPLOYED IN THE SEEVICE OP THE BUKKAU.
From the official statement of the Commis-
sioner of the bureau, made in answer to House
resolution of May 28, 1866, it appeared there
were three hundred and sixty-eight commis-
sioned officers paid by the United States, and
employed wholly in the Freedman's Bureau,
namely:
1 major general, at $445 00 per month, $445 00
7 brigadier generals, at 299 50 per month, 1,997 50
9 colonels, at  194 00 per month, 1,746 00
7 lieut. colonels, at  170 00 per month, 1,190 00
29 majors, at  151 00 per month, 4,379 00
157 captains, at  118 50 per monf.h, 18,594 00
158 lieutenants, average, 106 00 per month, 16,748 00
363 officers, pay per month $45,099 50
This gives a total yearly amount paid by the
Government to officers serving in the bureau
of S541.191 ; nor are these the only commis-
sioned officers paid by the Government to serve
the Freedmen's Bureau.
AKMY SHIlGKOiS IS THE PBEEDMKlf's BUKEAU.
In the report of Surgeon Caleb W. Horner,
the medical head of the bureau, dated October
31, 18C5, upon the medical department of the
bureau, he says:
"In pursuance of the plan of organization deter-
mined upon application vras mado to the Surgeon
General for the detail to the bureau of the following
surgeons and assistant surgeons of volunteers who
■were assigned to duty in various districts, the rank-
ing officer serving on the staff of the assistant com-
missioner as surgeon-in-chief."
Then follows a list of fourteen surgeons and
three assistant surgeons.
From a tabular statement in the same official
report we learn that the number of commis-
sioned medical officers on duty in the service
of the Freedmen's Bureau and paid by the
United States from October 1,1866, to June 30,
1807, was twenty-three, besides the one hun-
dred and fifty-five contract physicians paid by
the bureau.
HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL EMPLOYES.
I take from the late report of Mr. Eliot,
chairman of the House Committee on Freed-
man's Affairs—a' report abounding in under-
estimates and important omissions—the fol'
lowing kimtfiWy relating:to hospitals supported
by the bureau: • '
Greatestnumberofhospitals existing at,tny one time,
(latter partof 1866 and early part'of 1867....-...:...- 48
Number in operation at present, (February .1,.-
1868)   25

ber 31,1867    28

(May, 3867) 430
Number of attendants at present employed, (Feb-
ruary 1,1868) 317
civil employes op the bureau.
I am tempted here to insert the complete list
of agents clerks, surgeons, and messengers now
employed in the service of the bureau, with
their salaries, as one means of conveying some
adequate idea of the vast proportions and cost
of this part of the machinery of the Freedm,en's
Bureau. The following list may be found in.the
last United States Official Register compiled
under the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior and just published. The statistics h
contains are brought up to September 30,1867,
and does not include the hospital attendants,
nor the superintendents and teachers of schools :
