two regiments might do all the guard duty in the city, and that if we would undertake it, he would have us report to him, upon the further condition, however, that we shall be under his absolute command for guard duty, or any other service to which he may oblige us, uncontrolled by you or any other authority; that otherwise he does not want us under his command at all.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. J. EVANS,

Colonel Nineteenth Regiment Virginia Militia.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF RICHMOND,June 1, 1864.

Respectfully returned to Colonel Evans.

My statement to him was to effect that I would use that part of the militia which I thought necessary for guard duty; that I did not think the whole of the two regiments would be necessary for that duty; that I would make the service of all as agreeable as possible, but that after being put under my orders I must have abolute control, as of any other troops; otherwise the interference of different parties would make the militia a source of embarrassment, instead of an acquisition to my force. If the militia after being assigned to duty with me is liable to receive orders from any other source than these headquarters as to its position, movements, or duties, I must say that it can be of no use in this department.

R. RANSOM, JR.,

Major-General.
