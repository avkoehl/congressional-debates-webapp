east of Independence, who calculate to make a junction with rebel forces expected to come from below to join them in the Sni Hills, or that vicinity, for a raid into Kansas or anywhere else. They are under Todd, Pool, Thrailkill, and others.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 24, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Leavenworth:

Further news from the southeast shows some rebel force in toward Fredericktown. Parolel prisoners report Price following this with heavy trains. Dispatch from General Steele says Price has from 5,000 to 10,000 mounted infantry and seventeen pieces of artillery, and was at Pocahontas day before yesterday. I don't credit it. Thrailkill, Todd, Perkins, Quantrill, and Peacher, are in Boone and Howard Counties, not many on the south side, but a raid into Kansas is no doubt desired and watched with anxiety by the rascals.

Williams remains at Flat Creek, forty miles this side of Gibson. Report that Carthage, Mo, is burned. Price at Cane Hill and also advancing on Fort Scott. Colonel Ford's troops needed to relieve 100-days' regiment, whose time the expired. Please send force to Kansas City and Pleasant Hill soon.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 24, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Leavenworth:

Line open to Cassville this morning. No information has reached Sanborn as to Price's movements at Cane Hill, &amp;c., such as you report.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 24, 1864.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR:

General Rosecrans telegraphs that the telegraph is open to Cassville, and he gets no news of Price at Cane Hill, or the burning of towns such as you hear. What credence do you give to your reports and what to they amount to? Keep me posted by direct communication as to the news below. One hundred guns are being fired for Sheridan's victory yesterday.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
