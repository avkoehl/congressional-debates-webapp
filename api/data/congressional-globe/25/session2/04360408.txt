CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
To show the nature of the understanding exist-
ing, and the necessity for completing the bridge,
he would hand to the Secretary, and request him to
read for the information of the Senate a letter
from General Thomas T McKennan to General
Gratiot, and explaining all the facte relating to the
subject, and he thought that the information there
given would be sufficient to remove all the objec-
tions of the Senator from Connecticut..
The letter having been read,
Mr. NILES made some further observations in
support of hi« amendment.
Mr BUCHANAN said he would state the case
again. The stipulation on the part of the General
Government was that this road should be put in
complete repair, and ceded to the States. An esti-
mate was made for putting it in lepair, and m this
estimate was included the sum necessary for the
bridge over Dunlap's, creek. The contract wat,
made to build this bridge, and that contract was
partially complied with But it appeared that the
estimate had not held out, because civil engineers
were employed instead of military engineers In
addition to that, the commissioners of Pennsylva-
nia were so scrupulous, that they expressly stipu-
lated this bridge should be completed before they
agreed to receive the road.
After some remarks from Messrs NILES and
BUCHANAN, the question was taken, and Mr
Niles's amendment was lost—ayes 11, noes not
coun'ed
Mr HUBBARD offered an amendment to re-
duce the appropriation for the road in Oh o from
§150,000 to $100,000 and, after some lemarks from
Mr TIPTONin opposition to the motion, and
from Mr HUBBARD m its support, the question
was taken, and it was lost—yeas 17, nays 23, as
follows
YEAS—Messrs. Calhoun, Clay of Alabama,
Clayton, Hubbard, King, Lyon, Niles, Norvell,
Fierce, Prentiss, Preston, Roane, Ruggles, Smith of

The debate was luither continued by Messrs
NILES and PRESTON, after which the bill was
reported to the Senate, and the amendment made
as i'i Committee of the Whole was concurred m

On motion of Mr SEVIER, the Senate took up
the bill for the relief oí Matthew Arbuckle
Mr SEVIER observed, thatin consultation with
several gentlemen of the Senate, he had been satis-
fied that this bill could not pas  in the shape in
which he had reported it, and in which he was so
anxious that it should pass He had, therefore,
consented to modify it, so as to make the persons
interested pay for their lands at the Government
price, though he was fully persuaded that they
ought, in justice, to get them tor nothing Mr S
thea offered the following amendment
"Thateach and every owner of a Spanish or
French grant in Arkansas, which was aubmittedfor
adjudication to the Superior Court of Arkansas
Territory, and by thatCourt confirmed, are hereby
authorized, within twelve months, to enter at the
proper land office the land covered by said claim at
the minimum price, under such regulations as the
Commissioner of the General Land Office shall pre-
scribe, whether such claim originated in fraud or
not, and that upon the payment of the purchase
money, a patent shall issue to each claimant for
the land so held by him."
After some remarks from Messrs BUCHANAN,
PRESTON, and SEVIER,
Mr. CLAY of Alabama moved to amend the
amendment, by inserting the words, " being subse-
quent purchasers for a valuable consideration."
This amendment having been accepted as a mo-
dification by Mr. SEVIER, the amendment offered
by him was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to
be engrossed for a third reading.
The Senate then adjourned.

ceedings
Mi WISE resumed his remarks and went into a detailed his
toiy of the Golphm claim and the connection of Mr Secretary
Foisyth theiewith, and his mteiest m it, and contended that Mr
Forsyth had endeavoied lo j,ct this treaty negotiated and that,
undei threats fiom the Government of the United States, that,
if the Cherokee nation did not assent to the treat), they would
be given up to tile authorities of Georgia, and the treaty, he be
lieved, wasratmed by some Senators with a view to prevent
such a catasttojme He them remarked that, as it had been in
timated that there Was a rod m pickle foi him, or his argument,
or both, he sh\uld close with a fevr comments, though more
might be said, and further reading from the documents might
be brought l© sustain all thafhe had paid or read
He thtn went on to reply to some observations of Mr Towns
made on Wednesday and in relation to the position the S ate
ol Geoi-in had occupie I and to confirm ins assertion that the
whole scheme was one of plunder and robbery, that such was
the lact was admittcl, and though the act was not justified, it
w is partially excused on the stround that it was not worse ihtn
other acts of plunder andiobbery lie objected against the
urgency ofgentleinen from Georgia to have this treaty enforced,
win n it had been thus contraeted by fraud and force, as they
themselves admitted and he contende 1 that though it was not
directly stated m the Pre'ldent's Message, it was plainly ad
nutted in that document that the treaty ought not to be enforced,
and, m effect tb it anothei treaty ought to bo made He would
go as fai as the Piesident had ^one in his message and, asa
iriend to the Cherokees, he would advi&e them to accept the
leims offeicd, believing it would be all they would ever gel, and,
as a fnend to his country he would advise ihe gentlemen fiom
Georgia to acquiesce in that recommendation, and not to piess
the immedi ite enforcement of the tieaty
Mr GI ASCOCK then took the floor m defence of the action
of the people and Slate of Geoigia, and m reply to the general
chaiges which had been, as he contended unjustly made against
them He denied that frauds to the extent charged had been
committed, and whatever frauds had been perpetrated were
to be charged not upon the *>tate of Georgia, but upon the
G Wernment of the United States, and upon many of the poll
tic tl friends with whom the gentleman from Vnginia had
usually acted He then went fully into details in support of
tho treaty and to show that it ought to be executed
Mr DOWNING made some allusion to the Florida war m
illustration ofthe Indian character and to show the necessity
of being prepared to overawe the Indian nations and to compel
them to submit to treaties deliberately made The tieaty with
the C herokees, he contended was not shown te be fraudulent,
except ma proposed section, which had been reiected If any
other fraud existed he was not aware of it He had known
the Indians loi g, and knew then character, and they also knew
thecharactci oJ the whites, and he alluded to the reception of
news that a murder h id been committed in Geor0 „ and to the
succeeding message of the Pies dent, proposing e postpone
mentof a removal firtwo yeais with the inference that the In
dlans intended to operate upon the sympathies otournation, to
obtain inore money ^houiu such a course be adopted now,
he concluded that all othei (rlbes would conduct m the same
manner entailing perpe ual trouble andeontro isy He said
that the gentlemen who piofcssed so much sympathy for the
Indians must have gotten then knowledge of Indian character
from Cooper s novels but let them go and live among them,
as he bad done, and they would change thm feelings He had
known a man as honest as any m existence, in earth or hea
ven, go among them with evpry sympathy for the Indian , be
come, in one ye ir, as thorough an Indian hatei as he was
He thought thetreity with the Cheiokees ought to be en
forced and if the House had not paused—u thev had posi
lively refused ro receiveany appeal from the treat), and had
referred the Indians to the officers o1" the Government, there
moval, he thought, would lehg befoie have been effected He
also consideied the treaty favorable, arid was willing to pledge
himself for the people of Flonda, that they would, to a man,
consent to remove upon the same terms They woyld eive up
then affection for their homes, if the Government would pay
foi their imntovements, give them provisions for two years
and give them at their ultimate place of location, a better
country than that they should leave He believed the white m
habitants ol Georgia wiuld agree to the same (eims He re-
feire I to the action of the Government in suspending the re
moval accorumg to the treaty in terms of censui e, and said he
woi id appeal fiom Mr Poinsett sick and weak, to Mr Poinsett
m the full vigor of health, with an intimation lhat the respeet
he had always had for the becretary of War should not be di-
minished by his course upon this subject, though he thought it
impolitic, and iniurious to both parties to the treaty
