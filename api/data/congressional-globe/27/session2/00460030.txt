When the subjects were separated, and the Commit-

established the Committee on Manufacturer. And
who now propose to knock it away ' A Southern
Whig? No, one [Mr. Smith] who never claimed
that title, and did not want it, from a divnct of
Virginia, near this place. Let that fact go tn the
people of Pittsburgh The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania had cal'ed on Souihern Whi?s to come up
and stand by their standard. He (Mr. S ) did Dot
know what standard they had in Pittsburgh, the
Southern Whigs m this coun ry had s-nue ot their

Pennsylvania to come and staid by his sid  id re-

this Administration, and taunts us by asking
"where is this great reduction of expenditure, jou
promised us1" Beho'dhowsoiti p plain tale sha1 i put
him to the blush. The gentleonn had  a'd that the
expenses of Government this year for the fi-st
three quarl-rs amounted to £§24,734 346. Why
could not toe gen'lemin sa'e i.W from the 1st 0f
