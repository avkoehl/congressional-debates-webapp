DENVER, April 27, 1865.

General G. M. DODGE:

Previous to my taking command there was plenty of transportation, because citizens' goods were thrown out on the road as their teams passed. I required 100 wagons to load with corn at Omaha or Atchison for Laramie. The constant movements of troops to keep the Indians north of the road keeps my transportation occupied. I ask your permission to move my headquarters to Julesburg for a few months.
