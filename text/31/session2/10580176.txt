1\eo per cent. Fund in Missouri—Mr. lienton.
Senate.
the formula*ile collision should have been afranged
win h li >s elided 1.1 the deplorable catastrophe of
stoooisig !iu' P«"<121*ss (>I tlie Cumberland roud!
.No stone to pave the ro«it—no gravel to gravel
i! the enormous expense of getting stone and
crave!, the re.us >11 why the r>mil is stopped. So
eay another of the Senator's reason*., and here
are his words:
'• With re--pcct to the road itself, after it reached Illinois
it « inflil i,np.>s-iWt; to navel or to -Ion.' it. There was
proo! b n re mis bodv, 1 recollect. some fourteen years
.ijo, w.ien iM.a uit.Mhur, that >Une lor tlie puipo,.' m"

applied to pavi ig witu ?t >ii-' or traveling the ro irl. 1 his
hj, ti. ean.-e i>i Ihe enormous expenses which would l>e
oiaerwise occasioned lij tinnsportin^ tile stone ami gravel.'
Now the proof, as the Senator calls it, of no
stone, was only aI1 intimation ot its scarcity, and
was applicable to the country between the Great
and Little Wabash, before the road reached Van-
dalia on the Kaskaskia river; and the acts of
Congress to which he relers only applied to that
tioint, and were superseded by the act of 1838,
which made the usual lull paving appropriation of
£150,000 f >r esch of the three States, without any
limitation at all upon the application of the money.
But there is a witness to testify now before the Sen-
ate, and to disprove the proof which the Senator
alleges. It is Mr. Joseph Shriver, the commis-
sioner to l.iy oil' the road between Vandalia and
Jefferson City, and from whose report [ have al-
ready re id. I w ill now produce what he savs on
the special point of paving and macadamizing this
road.' He says: "Paving—twenty feet wide, six
' inches deep, macadamized, for the first sixty miles,
' (in Illinois.) >6.000 a mile; for first twenty-eight
'miles, (in Missouri,") 93,000 a mile; for the re-
' maintnsr eighty-eight miles, §1,500 a mile. In all,
• $576,IK,'0 for the whole distance of one hundred
'and seventy-seven miles, being an average of
' $3,200 for the paving and macadamizing." This
is the testimony of the witness; and thus the im- 1
possibility of paving and macadamizing turns out
to be no impossibility at all! and the enormous
expense of doing it turns out to be the cheapest
that ever was done upon the road, and in fact but
about one fourth part of what it cost east of the
Ohio river, and in favor of which the Senator from
Kentucky toiled so hard and for ho many years!
The whole actual cost of the Cumberland road
east of the Ohio, was near three millions of dol-
lars—distance one hundred and thirty-one miles;
the whole estimated cost of the road from Vanda-
lia to Jefferson City was §990,358—distance one
hundred and seventy-seven miles ! That is to say,
cost two millions more, and distance fifty-six
miles less, than the Vandalia and Jefferson City
road; and yet this to be objected to on account of
the enormity of the expense, and the objection
from one who was the great champion of the great
expenditures!
On this point Major Ogden is also a witness.
He was sent to survey the road from Vandalia to
Jefferson, and make an estimate of its expense in
1839; and he actually estimates the expense of
" metalling," as he technically calls it, at $608 less
in t ie average mile in Illinois than in Indiana; and
in Missouri at $2,750 less than Indiana in the
average mile. Where stands enormous expense
now?
Great indeed has been the expenditure upon the
Cumberland road—no less than $6,670,400; but
no part of it in Missouri: §0,813,000 were ex-
pended east of the Ohio river—§9,077,000 were
expended in the State of Ohio alone—§1,128,000
were expended in the State of Indiana, and
£742,445 were expended in Illinois. In Mis-
souri, nothing! Yet, the Senator from Kentucky,
who vited for all these vast sums, and plead
mmfully for them, and prided himself on the
magnificent road which was built, and that with-
out. Waiting for any two per centums from Ohio,
Indian i, or Illinois, now tells Missouri to wait!
that Congress is not bound to make any particular
kind of road for her! nor in any particular time!
that a dirt road may do her!
Exhaustion of the fund is another reason as-
signed by the gentleman for discontinuance of the
road. He seems to exult in that objection. He
brings it forward often, and dwells upon it with i
exultation. He says: :
'•One is, that it lias not gone to tiie Mississippi river, be-
cause tlie t'uud was exhausted when it readied V and ilia.
There was no longer any means tor pro>cciitiiij! the ru.ul,
arising from tin* two per eent. fund, heiond \ andaha.
" Kveu belbre tin* road reaches Vandalia the two per
cent, fund received upon tlie sale ol tlie public lands in
Missouri is exhausted, and more than three times exhausted.
What right bus slie, when the fund is exhausted, to demand
that tile road shall continue beyond Vandalia?
Tne\ ought to he willing to wait until the fund can be
aecuimitated from the sales ot the public lands hi Mia-
M>Ull.
•■l.et the fund accumulate, let further sales take place,
let tliere be money in the public Trea.-,ur\ ot tile ' nitt'd
States from the sales ot public lands in Missouri, and
stiema) call upou t'ie Government ot the railed £>t.uc  to
apply it under tlie compact.
'• If tlie road was not carried to the Missouri line, tliere^
were various reasons lor it. One was the tv Itau -: i" 11 ot
the liiiid. The fund may hereafter accumulate, it unappro-
priated, perhaps, to an amount sutlicient lo carry the ru&d
to tlie line ot Missouri."
I "ive the Senator the benefit of his own words,
for f have to contrast them with his own conduct^
Exhaustion of the fund ! Future accumulation of
the fund ! Let Missouri wait until the fund accu-
mulates from the sales of the public lands! This
is the Senator's language now. Was it the lan-
guage in 1S25, when he plead for the passage of
the act which induced the Missouri delegation to
pledge the two per centum of their State? Was
it language used by him when during thirty-two
years—from 1806 to 1838—he was pleading for
the upwards of six millions which were expended
on the road in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois? I)id he tell those
States that the fund was exhausted, and bid thei.n
wait for its accumulation r No, sir; no. He used
no such language then, and in point of fact con-
tradicted all such language by the whole tenor of
his conduct. There was no fund—next to none—
when these great appropriations were going for-
ward. It hardly began to grow. It only amounted
to about $1,343,281 in the year 1849; and was
nothing in 1806, when the heavy road appropria-
tions began.
Exhaustion of the fund is, then, a new argu-
ment, just discovered by the Senator from Ken-
tucky, never thought of by him when it.was much
more applicable, and now only pressed into the
service as one among many—as anything that
would serve the turn of defeating the Missouri
road. Six millions seven hundred thousand four
hundred dollars and seven cents, were the actual
payments on the Cumberland road from the town
of Cumberland to Vandalia, of which the Senator
from Kentucky was the great champion; and
never once thought of exhaustion of the fund!
Indebtedness of Missouri. That Missouri is
indebted to the United States on account of the
road is a further reason with the Senator from
Kentucky for nut extending the road to her. He
says Missouri is largely in debt to the United
States on account of this road, and establishes the
account thus:
"The deficit of reimbursement for the construction of
the whole road from Cumberland to Vandalia is about four
millions and a half; and if Missouri is liable fur her portion
ot that four millions arid a half, it, would be perhaps twenty
or thirty tunes the amount of >,"330,000."
This is the account against Missouri, as drawn
up by the Senator from Kentucky. The whole
amount expended on the Cumberland road is up-
wards of six millions of dollars; the whole amount
accruing from the two per cent, fund is about
§1,343^281—deficit four and a half millions; and
the Nlissouri portion of that either twenty or thirty
times the §230,000 which has been received from
her two per centum fund. The Senator from
Kentucky does not say whether it is twenty times
or thirty times the amount, but that it is one or
the other of the two. Very well. Let us try
mathematics, and see how it will come out.
Twenty times §230,000 is §4,600,000, which hap-
pens to be §100,000 more than- the whole sum
which the four States owe! That is to say, the
one-fourth of §4,500,000 is §4,600,000. That is
rather too much. That won't do; so let us try the
other—let us try thirty times. Thus: 30 times
§230,000 is §6,900,000 ! Worse and worse. The
fourth part of §4,500,000becomes §6,900,000.
Mr. President, I do not pursue this absurdity;
but I deem it right to notice it in order to let it be
seen that the Senator from Kentucky has either
discovered some new rule in arithmetic, some new
way of ciphering, by which a fourth part becomes
more than the whole, or that, in his zeal to deft/at
Missouri, he suffers his imagination to outrun his
judgment, and suffers his passions to lay hold of
anything, no matter how unfounded or preposter-
ous, to allege against her. Hut after all that is
said of the pledges of Missouri, they extend to a
very small part of the §6,700,400 07 which the
Cumberland road cost. There are seven appro-
priations, amounting to near three quarters of a
million, which include the Ohio two per centum
alone; there are sixteen others, amounting to above
two millions and a quarter, which extend to Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois alone; there are seventeen
others, amounting to near two millions and a quar-
ter, which are general appropriations out of any
moneys in the Treasury, anil without any pledge
of reimbursement out of the funds of anv State or
States whatever. So that there remain but a few
appropriations which extend to Missouri—a few
between the years 1825 and 1836; and these few
made under the pledges of the compact of 1820,
the act of 1820. and the act of 1825, to carry the
road to the State line, and thence to the capital of
the State; and which pledges the Senator from
Kentucky now repudiates, although a party to the
making of them. Did not the Senator from Ken-
tucky support all these appropriations, when there
was no fund? and even the seventeen, for which
there was no reimbursement?*
The Senator from Kentucky seems to taunt the
State of Missouri with some of his objections. He
says in one part of his speech:
" But again: the most tliat Missouri lias a right to de-
mand is, even supposing I am wrong in all the views I have
fi-l presented, that Government should make a graded road
from Vandalia to St. Louis. What would tliat cost? I
suppose tlie expense might be about $500 per mile. The
distance is about one hundred miles. The whole expense,
therefore, would be about ^50,000."
In another part he says:
"There is a road actually in existence from Vandalia to
the banks of the Mississippi, opposite to ft. Louis, and
another from Vandalia to Alton, opposite to Missouri. She
has the benefit of these roads. Would you make another
road
In another part he affirms that—
" Government was not bound to make a macadamized
road; any dirt road would answer the compact."
And in another part he thinks—
" That the General Government was not bound to make
any particular or specific kind of a road ; secondly, that it
was not limited as to the time when the road should be con-
structed ; thirdly, exercising the discretion expressly vested
in it by the compact between Missouri and the General
Government, the General Government expended not merely
,$••230,000, but probably more than three times that amount,
even admitting Missouri not to be chargeable for an) tiling
expended on tlie road prior to its reaching Illinois."
And in another part he exclaims:
"The Senate will also observe that no specific kind of
road is provided for. It is not provided that it shall be a
