HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,Washington, September 16, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN, Comdg, Middle Division, Berryville, Va.:

A deserter from the Eleventh Virginia Cavalry, who delivered himself up to Lazelle, reports that he made his way from Richmond via Lynchburg, Culpeper, and Warrenton. He reports no troops at the two latter places except a small guard; a small guard also at the Rapidan railroad bridge. Lazelle has gone with his regiment to this bridge; left this morning. I have good reasons for believing that the troops that my scout reported as leaving Gordonsville for Richmond were Pickett's division, who were on the way to the valley, but recalled by the affair on the Weldon railroad.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

Martin's battery and a battalion of cavalry left for your headquarters yesterday. About 800 infantry, convalescents, &amp;c., leave for same place to-day.
