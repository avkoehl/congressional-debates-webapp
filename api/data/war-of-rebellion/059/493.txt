April 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX,

Bull's Gap:

I have just received your dispatch of this evening, and Captain Bartlett has explained to me the difficulty about your moving before Manson returns. As I dispatched you this afternoon, I deem it quite desirable for you to march on the 27th. Yet, if Manson has gone to Jonesborough to-day, he cannot get back in time; but your work will be done the more promptly and you will probably yet be in time. Hascall's brigade did not move as at first ordered. Judah's division will move this way to-morrow.

Major-General.

Brigadier-General COX,

Bull's Gap:

You may continue the work of destruction above Lick Creek until Manson returns; then move your whole division together. Meanwhile send to Knoxville everything which would impede your march. If Manson can destroy the bridges above Greeneville to-day, and get back to the gap by to-morrow night, and the other brigade work all of to-day and to-morrow on the road above the creek, I think the result will be satisfactory, both in point of time and of work done.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, April 25, 1864.

General McPHERSON,

Huntsville:

General Grant telegraphs me to be ready by May 2. We cannot wait for the veterans. It may be well for your whole column to move from Scottsborough. They could be moved to that point by rail. The two divisions expected up from Cairo would cover that flank and guard the roads, or join you via Chattanooga. Make every possible preparation.
