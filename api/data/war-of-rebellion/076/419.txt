HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, neat Atlanta, August 8, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Order Captain Merrill to meet General Cullum at Nashville about the end of this week to consult about the defenses of Nashville. This by General Halleck's order. General Schofield has made some progress on the right, but not enough. General Howard has also advanced his line somewhat. Let me know if the 4 1/2-inch guns have come and where you will place them. A very good place will be on General Ward's right, on account of the opening made by the valley of Proctor's Creek, giving a plain of view of the very heart of the town. I wold like to have them at work to-morrow.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, August 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The 4 1/2-inch guns have not yet arrived. They are not due until to-morrow. I have selected a very good point for them on Geary's left, where you can bet a fair view of the town, and half a mile nearer than any other position. It was reported that that they were to leave Chattanooga at 8 a.m. to-day. The position selected enfilades White Hall street, upon which is General Hood's headquarters, and the battery is being built to-night.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
