L. H. EICHOLTZ,

Chief Engineer Military Railroad, Lick Creek, Tenn.:

There is no special hurry now, but I wish you to put the road in good order as farad Carter's Depot. By that time I presume I shall have further orders. We have sad news this morning of the assassination last night of President Lincoln and Secretary Seward. The particulars will be sent forward in the course of the day.

NASHVILLE, April 15, 1865.

Major-General STANLEY,

Greeneville:

Eicholtz may as well work deliberately along and repair the road in the best manner. We have possession of Lynchburg, therefore there is no particular hurry. I wish you to use every exertion to prevent depredations of all sorts on the part of the soldiers, as I desire if possible not to have to distribute guards along the road. I will se the postmaster here and find out what necessity there is of overhauling your mail at Knoxville. We have sad news this morning of the assassination last night of President Lincoln and Secretary Seward. Particulars will be sent during the day, afar as we can learn them.
