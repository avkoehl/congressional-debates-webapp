officers of junior grades, both of the old army and the volunteers, promoted, and brigadier-generals made of men who are juniors in rank and service to the lieutenants commanding in my squadron. The succoring and keeping of our army as long as they did remain at New Madrid was due to the small force under my command, and without these gunboats they would never have left that place, and this is not only my opinion, but that of the two generals commanding that army, and yet no word of encouragement is given to officers or crews. I will do General McCown the justice to say that in all official intercourse with him I have yet to find an instance in which he has not treated [me] with courtesy and attention and paid the respect due my position here.
