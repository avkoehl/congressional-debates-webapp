involved in t\lis bill. I believe that the public
judgment demands that we should take some
steps, this much at least, toward equalizing
the positron of the noteholder and the bond-
holder and toward reducing the interest of the
public debt. At this late period of the session
1 do not intend' to renew the discussion of last
January; btit if Senators wish fuller informa-
tion on the subject than I now choose to give
them, they will iind in the remarks made by
the Senator from Vermont, [Mr. EdMunrs,]
by the Senator lrora Missouri. [Mr. Hender-
son,] and by myself, statistical information that
•will enable them properly to answer most of
the questions that would naturally arise in this
debate. It is scarcely worth while afe this
period of the session to repeat the^e arguments,
especially by those Who participated iu the
former debate :

Thus by exchanging with the holders of
$500,000,000 of live-twenties of 18C2 the coun-
try is saved:
1. Till the maturity of the five-twenties
in 1882 $101,764,085
2. From 1882 till the maturing of a n.-w
thirty-year bond  168.148,375
Total saving till 1898 £269.912,460
Tt is thus plain that more than half of the
$500,000,000 would be self-extinguished by
1898. The other half would be redeemed by
the strict application and operation of the one
percent, out of customs receipts, which is stated
in the act of 1862.
The same principles and figures will apply to
the five-twenties of 1864 and 1865, except that
the country would gain two and three years
more savings in the diminution of interest.
Mr. SUMNER. The bill before the Senate
opens the whole question of financial recon-
struction. 1 do not know but that the Senator
from Ohio would prefer to proceed with the
amendments or the corisideration of details,
but if not disagreeable to him at this stage, I
should like to proceed with its discussion in
some of its more general aspects.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 will state to the Sen-
ator that 1 shall be very glad to hear him upon
the general proposition, but this amendment
now offered is the careful result of the fre-
quent deliberations of the Committee on Fi-
nance, and I do not know that the members
of that committee desire to change a single
word of it. We desire that the Senate shall
not adopt any amendments to this amendment
unless they appeal themselves clearly to their
judgment, beeaute the amendment, as it is now
offered, is the result of our deliberate consid-
eration, and the striking out of a ^vord, or any
