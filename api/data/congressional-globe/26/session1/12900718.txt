most be attained, however, m one way or another. You took
frota the people as good a currency as the world ever saw, un-
der the plea of giving them a better, end they will hold you to
«our engagement, not literally though, sir, tor they have had
enough of the better, and will only ask tor the g >od currency ol
which you depri vrd tliem by loud clamor and false pretences
I have before referred to a report made by a committee of the
Senate composed of the personal and political friends of «en
Jackson, at the session of 1829-'30, for one purpose, and 1 now
recurto it to show to "the party" what kind of a currency we
had when they began to imprtre it, and what kind we must
and shall have again Out of their own mouths shall they be
convicted After speaking of the local currency, the committee
say
•'Thereis,ho ever, superadded to this currency, a general
currency, more known, more trusted, and more valuab e than
the local currency, w ich is employed in the exchanges be
tween different parts of the country These are the notes of
the National Bank These botes are receivable for the Go
vernment by the nine thousand receivers scattered throughout
every part of the country They are, in fact, in the course ol
business, paid in gold or silver, though they are not legally or
necessarily so pai I by the branches ot the Bank in every section
of the Union In all commercial places they are received in all
transactions, without any reduction in value, and never, under
any circumstances, does the paper, from the remotest bi anches,
vary beyond a quarter of one per cent, in its actual exchange
for silver. Here, then, is a currency as safe as sliver—more
convenient and more valuable than silver—which, through the
whole Western and Southern and interior parts of the Union, is
eagerly sought in exchange for silver, which, in those sections,
often bears a premium paid in silver, which is, throughout the
Vnion, equal to silver in payment to the Government and pay
menta to individuáis in business, and which, whenever sslver is
needed in any part of the country, will command it without
the charge of the slightest fraction of a per centage By means
of this currency funds are transmitted at an expense less than
in any other country In no other country can a merchant do
What every citizen of the United States can do—deposite for in-
stance, his silver at St. Louis, or Nashville, or New Orleans,
and receive notes which he can carry with him 1000 or 1 600
miles, to the Atlantic cities, and there receive for them an equi
Talent amount ot silver without any expense whatever, and in
no possible event an expense beyond a quarter of one per cent
If, however, a citizen does not wish to incur the anxiety of car-
rying these notes with him, oc to run the hazard of the mail, he
may, instead or them, receive a draft payable to himself or his
agent alone, so as to insure the receipt of an equal amount, at
an expense of not one half, and often not one fourth, of the
actual costof carrying the silver The owner of lunds, for in-
stance, at St Louis or Nashville can transfer them to Pmladel
phia for one half per cent , irom New Orleans generally with-
out any charge at all, at most one hall per cent, Irom Mobile
from par to one half per cent, from Savannah at one-half per
cent; and from Chaileston at from par to one quarter per
cent."
Mr Chairman, I am tired of these currency investigations,
and I have no doubt you are, and I will, therefore, endeavor
speedily to end them after looking at the effects of your finan
ciering on the tj ate I in part represent
These importations of last year were one hundred and forty
millions, exclusive of re exports The population of Ohio is
probably about one tenth of the population of the Union, and it
is fair to suppose they consume one tenth of the imports, or
fourteen millions for the last year, to which cum are to be added
dudes, charges for transportation, and mercantile profits, in all
at least six millions, making twenty millions We gave for
that nearly our whole surplus products Now, these products
have diminished one half in value, and we shall have about the
same surplus as before The imported merchandise will be
■old no less because we are embarrasred We must pay the
same for a pound of tea or a yard of cloth, whether wheat be
worth fifty cents or a dollar Cost in Europe and incidentil
charges and profits we must pay, or not have the articles that
we may want. As, therefore, we cannot double our product,
we must halve the consumption, but tor that half we must give
tin same labor as we last year gave for the whole 1 hue, with-
out any equivalent, we shall be deprived of the benefit and
pleasure we enjoyed from the use of one moiety of what we
before had. If we are in debt, we must pay two barrels of flour
Where one would have sufficed The thousand dollars balance
due on my farm haj become two thousand The nan who has
money can buy twice as much as he could then, while the poor
man who ones but little must lose his all to pay that little
Thus, sir, of all plans to make rich men richer and poor men
poorer, I know of none more efficient than those set in motion
by this people loving, aristocracy hating Ad i mistration The
miserable miser in his attic, insisting upon his pound of flesh
because it was nominated in the bond, could not have devised a
•ourse of legislation more satisfactory to himself than that pur
Mlu this Capitol
Our State debt is about twelve millions, for which 1 am glad
to say we have value received—the interest is about $700,000,
and tms must be paid by the products of our labor, levied in the
shape of toils on the produce we sell, and the goods we con
sume, and the deficit must be provided for by taxation Last
year 700 000 bushels of wheat would have paid the interest—
now it will take 1,400000, and if the low pnces are to continue,
a result which we are told is to be productive of so much good,
we shall find our debt practically doubled, as well as our in-
terest.
My esteemed colleague [Mr Parish] accounts for the low
prices of our produce by charging it, most conveniently, too,
on the banks, which are made to carry not only their own ems,
but every body's else, and he exhibits tables showing the con
tractions and expansions for eighteen successive months, with
the fall and rise in the price offlour Well, now, sir, if the
price of our flour depended upon bank discounts, it must rise
and fall to correspond with the increase and diminution of the
discounts, but if any gentleman will take the trouble to exa
mine the tables, he wi 1 find no apparent relation Between them,
he will discover In certain periods, duringwhich the banks con
traded, say 10 per cent that flour fell 20 per cent and when
the contractions were 20 per cent flonr fell 10 per ccn' The
rise and fall of the puce of flour depends upon causes beyond
the reach of our banks—it must depend upon the value at the
ultimate market—severe contraction would retard some
what the sale and transportation, as expansion would facilitate
them, but neither would materially affect the price. If flou r be
worth ten dollar* in New York, it will sell promptly in Ohio
at from eight to nine dollars, whether our banks expand or con-
tract
But why hare our banks contracted! Why, sir, independent
o general causes exisung all over the countrv, theSolonsm our
Legislature, tor we have them there as well as here, wished to
show their financial skill by making experiments on heir own
account—they wanted to do their share of the great work of re
fanning the currency, that they might participate with us in
the glory to result from it The fiist experiment was at the
session before the last, our banks had been in the practice of
keepingtheirsurplus funds in the Eastern cities, on which they
could draw at sight for commercial purposes, and for the re
demption of their notes, a dtaft always being worth more than
specie, and, in fac , but a few years ago, a bank or an mdivi
dual sending home notes lor redemption, would think injustice
done if they could get nothing but specie. But our legislators,
in the plenitude of their wisdom, decreed that the banks should
keep coin ín'the r vaults at the rate ot one dollar for every three
in paper, this compelled them to withdraw, in coin, the ha
lances due them East, thus helpingto increase the embarrass-
ment there last year, diminishing the prices of our produce, as
we had done on a larger scale in England when we drew away
their gold, but they were also compelled to curtail their dis
counts and collect their debts, to bring the specie and circula
tlon in relative proportion
At the last session they voted small bills a nuisance, and de-
creed they should no longer be tolerated, and this compelled
the banks to razee again, because the vacuum created by the
withdrawal must be filled with specie, and that must be drawn
from the banks
But our Legislature was not only plenary in wisdom, but
plenary in power, and they, therefore, at the late session, as
serted and exercised the power of repealing bank and all other
charters, whether the right had been reserved or not And al-
though the power was exerted perhaps in proper cases only,
provided the right had existed, yet its tendency was still further
to agitate the public mind, already sufficiently feverish
True, sir, this was looked upon by men intelligent in such
matters as mere brutum fulmen, for we have fortunately a
Supreme Court, orthodox upon such heresies—a court that
will not deny to thesoveieign people the right to do in their col-
lective capacity that which each one individually, not being a
married woman, a child, a fool, lunatic, or a madman, may do,
to wit, make aeon ract that shall be obligatory I ought, sir,
to ask pardon of my married female friends for putting them in
such a category, but I wished to state the exceptions, that the
absurdity ol the proposition sustained by our Legislature might
be the more apparent.
My colleague says we the Oppesition party, intend to com-
pel the General Government to assume the debts ef the States
Where, sir, is there an iota of evidence of this design to be
found! Is it in the suggestion of a London hanker, that it
would add greatly to the value of the State stocks! Sir, we all
remember what a pi otracted debate there was in the Senate last
winter on a reBplution declaring that it would be inexpedient
and unconstitutional for this Government to assume the State
debts, when not a State in the Union had even intimated a w sh
that it Bhoulri be dono It would be unparliamentary for me to
say on this floor that the whole affair was superlatively rirlicu
lous, but I may be permitted to say that I believe every body
without the ten miles square thought so
At all events, Mr Chairman, whatever other States may do,
Ohio will never knock at yonder door as a suppliant, begging
this G ivernment to pay her debtp She is able and willing to
pay principal and interest to the uttermost farthing, and her
cieditors need give themselves no uneasiness about her comply-
ing with her engagements hereafter, as she has done heretofore,
and which has so justly given her stocks the character they
have at home and abroad
Mr. Chairman, 1 have trespassed longer than I intended upon
the time of the committee I have forberne to examine the de
tails of the bill, my principal object being to show that the plan
itself was objectionable in a pecuniary view, and highly danger
ous in its political bearings, and that, judging trom the past, no
reliance could be placed upon either the ability or the integrity
of the men in power, and therefore that we ought not to place in
theircontrol a machine so potent for evil of all sorts as this
wou'd be in the hands of bad man. Whether I have succeeded
or failed in accomplishing my purpose, others will determine
Sir, I told you it was not for me to point out a remedy forour
fnevances, but if I were called upon to make suggestions tl at
thought might be beneficially adopted, I should eay, priman
]y, pufhoneetand competent men into power to constitute the
substratum, without which no superstructure that such men
would erect could stand for a day Charter a Bank of the
Uuted States, with all suitable restrictions, whenever a decided
majority of the people called for it, regulate your tariff so as to
protect domestic ísdustry, but withrtit doing injustice to any
portion of the Union, ot any particular interest in it, divide the
proceeds of the public lands among the States, to which, as I
think, they rightfully belong, and to some of which they would
now be so convenient, and, finally, cease following men or
parties merely as such, but go, morning, noon, and night, for the
country, the whole country, and nothing but the country
Notíb —When I spoke of the hostility of the Van Buren
party to banks, I did not expect to have, so soon, record evi.
dencem the House of Representatives to substantiate my opi-
nion* Speedily after the Sub Treasury bill had passed, and
before It had been signed by the President—he retaining it till
the 4th of July lor his approval, upon the popular idea perhaps
that "the better the day the better the deed"—the Senate bill ex
tending the charters of the six hanks m the District of Colum-
bia, for two years, was called up for action in the House These
banks were all supposed to be in good condition, and no objec-
tion was made to them on any particular account other than
that they were hanks By the exhibits it appeared that the rir
culation was 8650 000— the specie 8420 000 and that the debts
due the banks by the people ol the three cities of the District,
and the adjacent counties of Maryland and Virginia, amounted
to two and a half millions When the banks in the neighbor
ing States suspended last fall, five of the six District banks did
the same, as otherwise their com would have been drawn from
them at once, and not foi the benefit of the people, but of spe-
culators
The Administration party determined to sacrifice these banks,
both specie paying and non specie paying, is an example as
they declared in debate, for the State Legislatures, ind to this
end offered amendments to the Senate bill, some of them avow
edly to wind up the banks, and others of such a characteras
would necessarily result in their destruction, either because
they would be unable to prosecute business at all, or because it
would be unpiofitable One amendment prohibited the issue
of bills under ten dollars, and was carried 96 a\ es all Van Bu-
ren; 76 nays,all Whig
Another as to twenty dollars was lost 83 ayes, all V B , 106
nays, 96 W 10 V B
Then as to fifty dollars, lost 69 ayes, all V B , 106 nays, 80
W 26V B
Another amendment rendered the president and directors se
verally liable for all the debts that might be owing by the hanks,
and for which suit could be brought at once against them, and
without having first exhausted the bank efT cts, and it was car
netl   92 ayes, all V B , 90 nay, 78 W 12V B
The hill, as it came Irom the Senate, provided that the banks
should resume specie payments as soon as the banks in Virginia
and Maryland, but in the House an amendment was offered and
carried, requiring an immediate resumption 87 ayes, all V B ,
71najs,66W 5V B
A measure fn itself abstractedly right, and with which the
banks could comply, but only by refusing nsw loans and com-
pelling their debtors to pay, thus punishing the people rather
thin the banks
The hill had by this time got into such a shape that many of
its friends refused to vote for it, and it was lost—a\ es 69, nai s
90                                                                                            J.J
Subsequently, on the 3d of July, the charters expiring with
that day, in order to prevent the loss of the corpoi ate character,
and thereby the debts due the banks, and to preserve the liabili-
ty of the banks to their creditors, a bill was passed continuing
the corporations two years, for the mere purpose of collecting
the twenty five hundred thousand dollars due them by the peo-
ple, and that the people might collect the outstanding notes of
the banks
Here, then, in this District, where Congress has exclusive ju-
risdiction, the party goes against all banks whatever, and for a
hard money currency    They were willing to sacrifice every
debtor to the office holders and Shylocks in and about the capi-
tal     The banks must begin and pursue coercive measures to
compel the payment of every debt due them within two years,
and men with money will be enabled to buy as much property as
they like at their own prices    And what better piocess could be
thought of than this to make "rich men richer, and poor men
poorer!"
Congress has done for this devoted District what no State Legis-
lature has done or would dare to do, and v. hat members of Con-
gress would not dare to do, if the people to be affected were their
constituents
COST OF TRANSPORTING SPECIE.
By document No 116, of the present session, sent to us by
Mr Woodbury, it will be seen that the expensé ef transporting
specie to pay demands on the Government is likely to form no
inconsiderable item in the annual expenditure    The following
items I copy from that document

This may be considered a good beginning in this hard money
experiment
PRICES OF LABOR IN HARD MONEY COUNTRIES,
OR WHERE THE CURRENCY IS MOSTLY OF SPE-
CIE
In November, 1833, the British Government directed its Con-
suls to answer certain questions as to the condi ion ofagricul
ture and of agricultural laborers within the districts of their
residence, and from the reports made by them it will he seen
that in France the wages were from ten to thirty cents a day, in
Germany from four to fourteen cents, in the Netherlands from
six to forty cents, in Italy from eight to twenty two centsa day,
varying with the kind of labor, the season of the year, location,
 nd upon the fact of boarding with the employer or at home, at
the higher rates the laborer invariably boarded himself
SPEECH OFMR.SALTONSTALL,
OF MASSACHUSETTS,
In the Bouse of Representatives, April 21, 1840—In reply
to Mr   Parmbnter, on the bill providing for the civil and
diplomatic expenses of the Government for the year 1840
Mr  SALTONSTALL said he hadb< en drawn into this de-
hate contrary to his expectation    The course which I have here 
tofore taken on this floor (said Mr S )will render it unnecessa-
ry for me to assure the committee that I have risen with ex.
treme reluctance to address I hem on subjects irrelevant to the
bill under consideration    Sir, I have watched the proceedings
of this House with great attention, and I confess that I have been
astonished at the boundless range of discussion
My colleague [Mr Parmentbh] has been pleased to inform
this committee of my to/mer conneetion with another legislative
body It is true, and I may be permitted to say that, from what
Iliad been able to learn there of parliamentary proceedings, I
hadsupposed that something like relevancy in debate must be
preserved I have been astonished, therefore, at the course of
this and of former debates I was,surpnsed to hear the history
of the Florida wai discussed on the Treasury note bill, and still
more surprised to hear the character and merits of a gentleman
now in private life, butone whomapoitinn of 1  fellow citi-
zens have recommended to ihe people as a candidate for the
highest office in their gift, minutely examined—to hear battles
and military operations mica! ly considered and discussed upon
the Cumberland road bill' Why, sir, a stranger might have
supposed that this Hou<e was a military tribunal, enpaged in
the trial of that distinguished man for his conduct m battles
fought and victories won by him a quarter of a century ago,
