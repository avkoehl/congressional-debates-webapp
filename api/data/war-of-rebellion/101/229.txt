HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 29, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel DAVIS,

Assistant Provost-Marshal-General:

COLONEL: You will proceed to North Arkansas, via Cape Girardeau, and deliver the accompanying letter to Brigadier General M. Jeff. Thompson and await his answer. Should he accept the terms offered you will make arrangements for carrying them out, paroling his command, &amp;c. Brevet Brigadier-General Beveridge will give you all the aid you may desire and respond to any call you may make upon him. You are to understand that no other terms can be granted him, and refrain from expressing any opinion contrary to the spirit of the terms designated. This being purely a military matter, civil matters will not be treated or talked of, we having no authority whatever in those matters. Should General Thompson surrender it is probable you may need transportation for any war material he may have. In making out the paroles make them the same as made by General Grant.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same to Captain J. F. Bennett, assistant adjutant-general.)

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 29, 1865.

Brigadier General M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Commanding District of North Arkansas:

GENERAL: I inclose herewith official copies of dispatches received from the Secretary of War announcing the surrender of all the armies of the Confederate Government east of the Chattahoochee River; also the official report of the surrender of Mobile. The U. S. forces have also captured Selma, Columbus, Montgomery, Macon, &c. The terms granted by Lieutenant-General Grant to General Lee will be given the forces under your command. By accepting these terms you will put an end to the further destruction of life and property in North Arkansas. To continue the struggle longer must be evident to you is useless. Should you not accept these terms, being inside of the U. S. Army, and the authorities whom you claim to be serving having no longer an existence de jure of de facto, they will immediately be declared outlaws, and no terms thereafter granted them. Lieutenant-Colonel Davis, my staff officer, will hand you this and await your answer. Should you accept, the arrangements for carrying out the terms designated will be immediately made by him, he having full authority to carry out the arrangements herein specified.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General, Commanding.
