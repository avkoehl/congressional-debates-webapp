HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Camp on Little River, Ala., October 24, 1864.

Brigadier General K. GARRARD, Commanding Second Cavalry DIVISION:

I have the honor to inclose herewith copy of communication of this date from Major-General Sherman. * Special Field Orders, Numbers 103, of this date, directs me to report to General Thomas for assignment to duty. Before its receipt I had informed General Osterhaus, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps, en route for King's Hill, that your DIVISION would draw rations and leave this place at 3 a. m. to-morrow and overtake him, and that I would then explain to him the position of the enemy as we found it on the 23d. It is the order of General Sherman that your DIVISION should co-operate with the Fifteenth Army Corps in this reconnaissance. You can comply with his wishes and give General Osterhaus the necessary information.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Gaylesville, October 24, 1864.

General O. O. HOWARD:

GENERAL: You will please send the Fifteenth Corps forward in connection with the cavalry to test the position described by General Elliott in his report of last night, to ascertain if the enemy has attempted to make a barrier from the mountains to the Coosa to oppose the army or merely to create delay. Let the officer

in command proceed with due caution and take with him a couple of rifle batteries. Leave all incumbrances at camp and return when the truth is disclosed.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Gaylesville, October 24, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Major-General Schofield just reports that at 6 p. m. the pontoon had reached Cedar Bluff. The general commanding desires to have you instruct General Osterhaus not to be drawn too far, as with the use of the pontoon at Cedar Bluff we can better threaten the enemy via the south side of the Coosa, in that more open country, than by pushing into the gap where he is now operating.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Gaylesville, Ala., October 24, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD, Commanding Department of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: In pursuance of the policy indicated in our conversation to-day concerning the cavalry forces, General Sherman wishes you to telegraph to General Grierson, directing him to send Hatch's DIVISION at once, via the route indicated, to join me in the field with all the men he can mount and equip. The dismounted men should be sent by the
