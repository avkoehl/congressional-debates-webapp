of two steamers at this place to be fitted up as rams and gunboats. I shall instruct the whole matter to Captain Porter till you otherwise direct. Everything in relation to these boats will be subject to your order. Is it not possible by lashing bales of wet hay or cotton on exposed sides of gunboats to get one or two through in the night to the assistance of General Pope?

NEW MADRID, MO., April 5, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I arrived here at noon yesterday. Found General Pope's command all ready for movement as soon as batteries and transports could be got ready. Last night Captain Walke, with gunboat Carondelet, ran the gauntlet at Island Numbers 10. Was fired upon from all their batteries, but was not struck once. Here arrival will enable General Pope to carry out his plans promptly. You will hear from here within three days. I remain with this army and will report frequently.

Assistant Secretary of War.

General CURTIS, Cassville, Mo.:

I will meet you to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock. The great battle of the war is to be fought on the Tennessee River. If we succeed, Price and Van Dorn will soon leave your front.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, April 5, 1862.

General CURTIS, Cassville, Mo.:

Captured letters received to-day from General Steele say Van Dorn is at Jacksonport, and is expecting re-enforcements from price by Clinton and Batesville. General Cabell of at Pocahontas with about 3,000 men, but express Van Dorn daily. Kansas troops a humbug. Can't do anything with them till reorganized, with different officers. Send General Sturgis to do this. If fully satisfied of price's move east, leave a small force to hold a position near the frontier, move with main body by Forsyth and thence on Salem or down White River on Batesville. General Steele will be ready to co-operate with you. I think a cavalry force should move by Carrollton and Yellville to observe the enemy. If you think best, draw down the Tenth Illinois Cavalry to Gainesville or to Salem. The First Illinois Cavalry will be sent to Rolla on Monday or Tuesday, to act as your order. I go to Tennessee the early part of next week. We should converse freely before I leave; nevertheless I have arranged to have telegraphic communication with you and General Steele from here.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
