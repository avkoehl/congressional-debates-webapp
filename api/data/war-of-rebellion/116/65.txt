Mr. WHARTON. I want to know how you know these particular papers?

The WITNESS. I saw these papers originally in Boston before Captain Devereux signed them.

Mr. WHARTON. Before they were signed?

The WITNESS. I saw thembefore and after. I knew that such articles were to be shipped and saw them.

Mr. ASHTON. It is not important.

Mr. WHARTON. I do not know that it is improtant but the district attorney seemed to suppose it was important to have these particular papers identified. I do not understand that what the witness says gives any validity to the papers. All that he says is that he saw them on a prior occasion.

The WITNESS. I presume these are the same.

Judge CADWALALDER. I do not see that it is very important on either side.
