CHAFFIN'S, May 17, 1864 - 4.45 p. m.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

My scouting party has just returned and reports that they drove in the enemy's pickets and found him in large force on Malvern Hill. From observation and information from two prisoners captured, Colonel Rovins thinks there are three brigades on alvern Hill. He could form no idea whether or not here are other forces beyond Turkey Island Creek. The force that came up on my front last evening is represented by citizens who saw it pass to be 2,000 mounted infantry. The reconnaissance seems to have been well conducted and I hthink the information may be relied on. Fighting between Chffin's batteries and the gun- boats progressing.
