APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May, 1838.
Mr. Clay's Resolution—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
return of peace or without the intervention o the
authority of Congress Having performed the
function for which it had been adopted, the resolu-
tion itself ought lo be considered defunct
He could not agree with those on the one hand,
who considered it mandatory, or on the other, as
•onferring discretionary power on the Executive
It was a simple recognition of the long-continued
practice of the Treasury to receive the notes ot
banks that weie paid on demand, while it overruled
the more recent practice of receiving those that
were not, and it may fairly be considered as a
sanction of the former, and the condemnation of
the latter It is well known how the practice
originated The aU of Congress, passed m 1789,
directed all the dues of the Government to be paid
in gold and silver coins The then Secretary of the
Treasury, in the face of this positive law, acting
under the dangerous and delusive idea still enter-
tamed by the Senator from Massachusetts, that
bank n°tes w ere identical with gold and silver,
ordered them, contrary both to law and the Consti-
tution, to be received at the Treasury as specie
Congress acquiesced, and thus gave its implied
sanction to this dangerous order, which has been
productive of so much mischief Thus things stood
when the general suspension took place this time
twelve months, when the Government became
disconnected entirely from the banks That
event ought to be fairly considered as putting an
ei d to a piactice tint ought never to have existed,
and restonng the ascendancy to the laws, winch
are still on the statute books unrepealed, and which
direct nothing but the legal coins of the Govern-
ment to be received in the public dues He re-
gretted that the Executive did not seize the occa-
sion, and itscinel, as it might fairly have done, the
original uider of Geiieiai Hamilton, and thus ie-
store the currency to what the Constitution in-
tended It would have been, in his opinion, the
propTcouise, and one in which the country would
have sustained it triumphantly
His object in making these remaiks was not to
influence the Senate, but to place himself on the
ground on which he desired to stand m íeference lo
tin question He saw what was sonung, and ex-
peri nee had taught him the necessity, in discharg-
ing Pis duly, to guard against misrepresentation
No oppoitunitv had been omitted (or years past to
distort and misrepiesent all In said, or did, which
he hid be n able to baffle only by a rigid adhe-
rence to tin he belcied to be light, accompanied
by a fai'hlul exposition of his viaws on all trying
qu stions IXe did not doubt but that another ex-
plosion would follow at no distmt djy, aiuhe be-
lieved trie Seriate was moving precipitately and
tnoughtlessiy in the direction that would pío
duce it
The Senator tells us that the present ciis sis veiy
like that of 1816 He could not agree with him
The two were in his opinion wholly inhke, both m
the causes which led to then and the consequences
likely to follow The foimer occuned in a period
of wai, and grew out of circum tances connected
with it, and as the only other ^eneial svtsoension
that had ever occurred bclore too'i place undei
similar c re imstane.es, (he me'ii' the one in Tul-
lan 1,) the im, lession was that the suspension was
the mere n eident of war, and belonging exclusive-
ly to such periods The only th ng then thought
to be necessary was to cause a resumption, when
it was believed the system would move on
steadly and successful!j, w nhout the hazard of a
shock, till another war "We were all, in tact, at
that time, veiy lgno-ant of the real character of the
bat kings}stem, and the dangets to which it was
exposed But what is the fact now' The stoppage
has taken pi ce in time of profound reace and uni-
versal prosperity The system has sunk down, and
stopped on a dtad level It is m vain we again
can on a United States Bank to put it in motion
Th establishment of one would crush halt of ihe
existing institutions, and cause a dera getaent and
distress greater than what followed in 1818, '19,
a< d '20, after ihe establish neiit of the former
The only safe rempdy s ihe total and entire se-
paration of the Government fiom the banks The
evil lies m the union, and the remedy in disconncc
{ion.   That has already partially restored the sys-
tem to a healthy condition, and, if persisted m,
would affect a permanent cure Had it not been
for the separation, the disease, instead of being ar-
rested in a great degree, as it is, would have been
greatly aggravated, if not wholly incurable In-
stead of resumption, bank paper would have gone
on rapidly depreciating, all of the cities along the
coast would have been interested in depreciating
their bank paper. The more they depreciated it,
the less duty, in point of fact, they would have had
to pay, and the city that depreciated most would
have drawn all the trade. The separation pre-
vented this state of things, and threw the induce-
ment into the opposite scale, that of resuming, in-
stead of depreciating the paper Continue the
remedy, and a complete restoration would follow,
but instead of that, our daily study is to get clear
of it, and to return lo that very state ot things
which caused it
It is time we should reflect and understand the
laws that govern the disease that now afflicts the
country When a suspension takes place, there
are but two modes by which a cure can be ef-
fected, the one is to leave it io the gentle operation
of time, without coercion, under the simple apph
cation tint has been made in this case, and the
other is to resort to a United States Bank, oi some
other instrument of coercion The foimer has the
advantage of effecting a cure without destroying
the public institutions, and oppressing the debtoi
class, but leaves the patient subject to relapse
It simply brings the system hack to wheie it stood
prior to the attack, and kaves it exposed to
another lo guard against a relapse, the tonic
which stopped the disease must be continued It
niNst not be discontinued on the first intermission
of the disease Such is the present case Die
Ionic that has anested the disease, as he has slated,
is the withdrawal of the Government Jrom a con-
I nection with the banks It has brought the bank
mg system back to where it was before the suspui
sion, and, if continued, will íeílore it to heilth,
but, if discontinued, will be. sme, to be followed bj
a relapse
The other i medy i-, to est iblish a National
Rink, and to kp( p the. s; s em right by its control-
ling influence, and those who are in favor of it aie
impatient to lay aside the remedy that has already
pioved to be so efficacious, and at the same time
so gentle They may succeed in that, but un-
ios he was wholly deceived, they will bo entirely
el ceivcel in th n favint" ruaedy It will b>, m
his r pinion, impossible to establish a Bank All
ihe powerful existing institutions, and those that
arc contemplated, will be opposed to it, which,
added to those who are opposed to it on the higher
grounds of [he Constitution and liberty, will inter
post, an obstae'enot tobe ovcicome But if it should
be. established, it would piove but a temporary re-
medy It would crush, as he has stated, half of
the existing institutions, leaving an open space for
its own operation, and during tins state of things,
the cmrenc) w mid be comparatively sound, and
safe from th* hazard of ie\ ulsion But a new cop
ot banl s would again spring up n tne course of
ten oi fifteen >e irs when veuld ig^in. encumber
and ciowd each otiiLi, and cruse another süugírle
for existence, jus* as u i the e ase before th" expi-
ration of the chartei of the late Bank, to be follow-
ed by similar, but more disastrous consequences
He would say to those witn whom he has bpen
acting on tms occasion, you have a good cause,
and all that is wanting is firmness and fidelity 'o it
Be careful to avoid every act which will leave the
ptojlc doubtful as to -your sincerity Nothing
would pio\e so fatal to the cause What has been
done alieady has ciused grerit mischief in unset-
tling the public mind Nothing was so fatal to a
good cause as art ai d management He had had
some experience in political affairs, and had never
vet known a good cau e, honestly and manlully
ma ntamed, fail to succeed
REMARKS OP MR   BUCHANAN
Mr  BUCHA1SAN sail he woull confine hm.
self to a lew obsen itions on this question, because
he   desued   that   a   finil   disposition    might   be
maae of the subject be'ore the adjournment of the
Senate to-day.   He was decidedly in favor of the
fiist branch of the resolution, which would repeal
Ihe Specie Circular, and was opposed to all therest.
First, then, as to the repeal of the Specie Circu-
lar. He would not now go back to its origin, or
discuss the question whether it ought ever lo have
existed. I shall consider this question, said Mr. B.
under the aspect in which it presents itself at the
present moment, and m the existing condition of
the country. I find that the banks generally
throughout this immense country are now engaged
in a struggle to resume specie payments, in which
may God speed them1 The curse of an irredeema-
ble paper currency is one of the greatest cutses
which can befal any people. It is then the im-
perative duty of this Government to remove every
obstacle in the way of resumption which it can,
and by all the means wiihm it" power to aid m
this great effort. Upon this principle, I think that
the Specie Circular ought promptly to be repealed
It is due to the people of the Western and South-
western Slates Whilst throughout the whole
Atlantic frontier, the dues of the Govern-
ment may now be paid in the notes of
specie paying banks, in all the new States
gold and silver alone ate receivable Whilst the
customs are payable in bank notes, nothing
but specie can be received for public lands Is
this equal—is it just, m the present circumstances
of the country'2 I ask how is it possible for the
Western banks to resume specie payments m the
face of this Specie Circular' Should they make
the attempt, what would be the consequence' In
addition to the ordinary sales of public land by pri-
vate entry, public kales of large bodies of land are
now advertised throughout the Western and South-
western States If all the lands purchased must
be paid for in specie, the inevitable consequence
will be, a ruinous and exhausting drain of gold
and silver from the banks m that portion of the
Union, to supply the demand thus created It will
operate precisely like a foreign dram ef specie from
the banks of our commercial cities, because it will
he transported to a great distance—to the extreme
frontiers of the country—in order lo pay the debts
of the Government, and a gieat portion of it can
never return to the places from whence it was
taken If this Treasury Circular should not be
repealed, our brethren m the West will suffer all
the evils of a depreciated paper currencj, whilst we
of the East will be redeemed from this calamity
And why1 Because, whilst we in the East, under
the joint resolution of 1816, will have the notes of
our banks received m pa} ment of the customs, the
people of the West will have the notes of their
banks excluded in payments of the public lands.
I think that if the Government be not bound to aid
the banks m resuming, it ought, at least, not to
stand in the i/ay The resolution of 1816 ought
to be ren lered uniform in its operation thoughout
the whole country, by the repeal of the Specie Cir
cular, and all the banks and all the people ought
thus to be placed on a fair and equal footing in
their efforts to resume specie payments
H> cou'd net agree with his friend from Mis-
souri, [Mr Blnton ] that the Specie Circular ope-
rate 1 as a pie-emftie,n law in favor of those who
des rfd to become actual settlers and cu)tivators,and
gainst speculators Directly the i everse w as proba-
bly the fact Was it easwr for the farmer to ob-
tain specie tian for the speculator1 That was the
question Was it not manifest that the speculator—
the man who could command extensive means and
enjo}ed the favor of the banks, could more easily
procure gold and silver than the cultivator of the
so I, who was almost obliged by the necessity of
his condition to sell his ptoduuions for the com-
mon paper circulating medium of the country1
He apprehended that it would be found, uponexa-
mn ation, that ander the operation of the Specie
Circular, the farmerswho desnedto purchase small
tracts of land, had to obtain their specie from these
very speculators, and that at an extravagant pre-
mium
He was opposed to the second branch of the re-
solution of the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr. Clay,]
for what he deemed to be the strongest reasons.
We are (said he) engaged m a great struggle, and
it is vain to disguise the fact We must eitbe-
have a Bank of the United States, or the Govern
