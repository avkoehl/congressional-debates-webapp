Major General LEW. WALLACE, Covington, Ky.:

The following is just received:

Governor MORTON:

I sent three citizens, scouts, into Kentucky day before yesterday morning, and the last one has just come in. He is perfectly reliable, and reports as follows:

"We went within 3 miles of Florence about noon to-day. At that time a large body of the enemy had passed through in direction of Covington, on Covington and Lexington pike; the whole force moving in that direction on that road was said to be 12,000-infantry, artillery, and cavalry. He heard their drums and artillery wagons distinctly. A great many of their men are reported to be barefooted. The information he received as to their numbers, conditions, and mode of attack on Covington and Cincinnati came from reliable acquaintances. they are approaching from three different points, viz, by the Lexington and Covington pike, Independence pike, and down Licking River. On both sides they have pickets out 7 miles from the river. Opposite North Bend hundreds of rebel citizens of Bone and adjoining counties are joining the confederate forces as they passed along. Secessionists at Florence said the intention was to cross the Ohio at or below North Bend and attack Cincinnati in the rear.

Whole force estimated at 30,000January
