M C had M-o been charged as having left his
coait <, -nd i t c crc Is with exec ations, going
hor-" > ith reotl s* kss and disgast, and as return-
ing back to aiaio^ the country. What was the
ground of this charge?   Mr C had returned under
urgent circumstances, his office had been unsoli-
cited, and he had resolved to do hi-, duty in these
stiugales and these times, and he had denounced a
military aspirant, and had denounced him in lan-
guage which he was proud to have used, when he
had exclaimed, Send us war, pestilence, and fa-
mine, rather than curse us with a military rule, and
if he could have then foreseen that this execrable
measure, the Sub-Treasury bi1!, would have been
introduced by the influence which he then depre-
cated, he would then have denounced it as he did
now, as not at all preferable to war, pestileree, and
fan me, and as not inferior to anv one ot them in
its malign effects on in" welfaie and prosperity of
the couutiy.
One oí theSenalois ftom Connecticut had said
that political missionaues fiom Kentucky had
been at work in Connecticut Mr C. denied the
fact that an) su„h missiomiy hid gone ¡torn lis
State, it was a work of that Senibt's own ímigi-
nation, without the fact to support it, at least Mi
C knew no foundation whatevei for such a charge
In íespect to the d>cirme of instruction, il-
thou"h he had the ns'it to ixpiess any opinion,
Mr C would have said n thing about it, but foi
«hit the S natens troui Conn ticiit themselves
hid said, that en tlx ir \ott hung thi 'He of the
Sub Tre isiirj bill And w "s not Mr C's ^i ue In-

to liiqmie whether th >st. «ho vie-ie to fix this mea-
sure on the ootintij were acfinj; in conformity with
the views of those whom they heir- represented?
And are we to be told that a majonty of the peo-
ple of Connecticut, as well as of the Legislature,
are adverse to this measure, and yet to hive u
fixed upon us by their two Senators, who, at the
same time, acknowledge that they were acting con-
trary to the will of the majonty of the people of
then own Slate? And aie Senile-s not at liberty
lo call on them to respect then i isirnctions undci

HOUSE OF REPRESÉISTATIVES,
rriDtY,June22,1838,
Mr   ADAMS continued his remarks m opposi-
tion to the report of t^e Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs on the subject of the annexation of Texas, and
m support of die motion to recommit it with in-
struction    In the-course of hi   remarks, Mr A
has given a detailed account of the proceedings of
the House m relation to their action upon Ü e sub-
ject cf petitions respecting s'averj, and the annexa-
tion of Texas, as incidental to that subject  He has
given, m order, thediffeieat times when petitions
and resolutions of State Legislatures have been pre-
sented to the House, and has stated the action of th«
House thereon. He has also read and commented
briefly upon many of the memorials- and resolu-
tions, with arguments to show that the action 6f
the House had not been correct in principle, nor in
accordance with the wishes of a large portion of th 
people.
Mr. A then gave way for the orders.
ADJOURNMENT OF CONGRESS
Mr MeKENNAN moved the House to take up
the «solution of Mr. Boon, proposing to fix the
period of adjournment of the present session of
Congi ess.
Objection being made—
Mr. McK moved a suspension of the rules, and
thereon asked for the yeas and na>s; which, being
oideied, were—yeas 139, nays 55.
So the rules were suspended, and the resolution
being taken up,
Mr. MaKCNNAN moved to strike out the
" first Mond iy," and mser t the " sscond Monday"
m July
Mi BOON accepted this as a modification.
Mr NAYLOR moved to substitute the " first"
Mond iy     Lost without a divisi m.
Mr GARLAND of Louisiana moved to insert
the " third" Monday in July.
Mr CALHOUN of Massachusetts called for the
j cas and nays, which were ordered.
Mi GARLAND then, as a reison for the motion
he made, drew the attention ot the House to the
mass of business on the calendar, especially relat-
ing to the western country.
Mr. BOULDIN said he was anxious that the
public business should be done That it might be
done, was true, that it mwht have been done, was
equally true. But if the gentleman from Louisiana
[Mr Oakland] thought that length of time would
secure that object, he would ask him to look back
upon the last six or set en months, and see what
had been done m all that time. He said, if they
were disposed to do the business now, he had no
doubt that every thing material could be done by
the ")th ot July If they did not wish to do it, they
never would do n in any length of time. If they
meant to doit, let them do it, if not, let them go
home
Mr E WHITTLESEY was convinced to the
contrary, ioi there weie several pressing bills
that would take up days each in discussion.
Though lie was as anxious as any one to get
awa;, yet he was unwilling to do so, and leave
such a mass of business unfinished
Mr BOON explained that the object he had m
originally moving the resolution at the time he did
was to bring to the consideration of the House that
it wai> necessary for Congress to take an order to
adjourn at some time or other He was as anxious
as any man could be, that before the House ad-
journe 1, tht most important measures before them,
and more esp'-cially, of all the rest, the bill to re-
duce aod graduate the pnce of the public lands,
v ith the bills in relation to the aimy, the western
frontier, &c should be acted upon. Butifgentle-
t emen would onl) leave off talking, and vote, they
mi"ht jet act upon them all by the yth of July. If
they would only act upon the principle of those
great men Geoige Washington and Benjamin
franklin, \.ho never spoke in public over about
five minutes at a t me, they could get through
with their business in a couple of weeks from Mon-
day Indeed, t ley ought to have got through it a
bngtime ago, and could have done so, if tbey
had net wasted «o much time
Mr HAYNES said he would show his estimate
of the value of time by moving the previous ques-
tion, but the House refused to second it—ayes 79,
noes 95
Mr NAYLOR urged the House to adopt ths
latei cay
Mr HAYNES rose among the most vociferous
cries of "Question1" from all parts of the hall,
which continued for some time When order was>
restoied, Mr H said he would have stood there
till doomsday, rathei than be cried down. He had
merely risen to call for the yeas and nays on the
amendment, and, as
The CHAIR was about to propound the call to
the House,
