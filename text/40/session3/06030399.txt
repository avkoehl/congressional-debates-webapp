1869.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ine which of these great systems of water com-
munication shall be first-prosecuted to comple-
tion, or whether they shall all be completed
as one system of water communication. I
regard the one embodied in my amendment as
of at least equal importance, and therefore one
which should be considered now in connection
with the main proposition before the House,
especially so as both improvements can be made
with the appropriation asked for in the bill,
and both being in the interest of cheap naviga-
tion cannot conflict with each other. I sub-
mit to the gentleman from New York, who
argued here yesterday that the true interest of
the people of the West was to divert this appro-
priation for the purpose of enlarging the New
York canals, that the canal policy of_ New
York has not been, and is not to-day, a liberal
policy toward the grain-producing States of
the West.
When I interrupted him yesterday to state
that the Brie canal had placed $15,000,000 in
the treasury of New York over and above the
cost of that canal and its maintenance and re-
pair, I only stated what is the truth. In other
words, sir, the people of the western States,
for the transportation of their cereals to the
markets of the world, have been compelled to
pay into tlie New York treasury the entire cost
of the Erie canal and $15,000,000 besides. I
know that the gentleman replied that the whole
canal system of New York cost $10,000,000
more than has been paid into its treasury ; but,
sir, he forgot, or at least he did not say to this
House, that these lateral canals built from
various parts of New York to connect-with this
Erie canal for the purpose of benefiting one
or two or three counties, have peculiar privi-
leges accorded to them in the way of draw-
backs. These drawbacks to these lateral lines
almost equal the entire cost of transportation
of products passing from them into the Erie
canal, which cost is added to the through tolls
on the main line. Thus it will be seen that by
the policy of New York the West is compelled
to pay the entire cost of this Erie canal as well
as the cost of keeping it up, for they charge
the through traffic with these tolls and relieve
their own citizens by means of these draw-
backs from the payment of any toll whatever
on the main line. Therefore it is, sir, that
the people of the West have been led to con-
sider the subject of buildingthis ship-canal for
the purpose of reducing, if possible, the high
tolls of this Erie canal, under the control of
the canal board of New York, by securing a
competing water line from Lake Erie to the
sea-board.
In saying what I do with reference to the
canal policy of the State of New York, I do
not underestimate the value of the Erie canal to
the West. Computing the charges made by
the Erie and New Yoik Central railroads for
transportation, and comparing them with the
actual cost of transportation by the Erie canal
from Buffalo to New York, the saving to the
people East and West for ten years from 1855
to 1864 inclusive, reached in round numbers
the sum of $178,000,000, or about eighteen
million dollars per annum. Yet during this
time the actual cost of transportation on the
canal, compared with the receipts, was about
twenty-one per cent., while the actual cost of
railroad transportation, compared with the
receipts, was nearly sixty per cent. This great
reduction famishes an incontrovertible argu-
ment in favor of extending these water lines to
the Mississippi river, which leads me to the
immediate consideration of the amendment
which I have proposed to this bill, which pro-
poses to divert $1,000,000 appropriated by this
bill for the purpose of securing a practicable
water line from the Mississippi to the chain ot
lakes on our northern border. This improve-
ment is essential to all the States west ot Lake
Michigan, in order that these States may avail
themselves of cheap water lines east of Lake
The States resting on the borders of these
lakes have now, by means of the Erie canal,
comparatively cheap rates, while the States
west arc compelled to rely wholly upon rail-
roads to Chicago or Milwaukee or transport
their products to New York via New Orleans
by means of the navigation of the Mississippi,
obstructed as it is by the rapids at Rock Island,
which obstructions I hope will be substantially
removed during the next year by means of
appropriations already made, and others which
I hope will be made before the close of the
present Congress.
It is well known to every western man that
during navigation in the summer months it
costs from fifty to seventy cents per hundred
for transportation from New York to Chicago
by water, 1,000 miles, while from Chicago to
Dubuque, a distance of only 183 miles, we are
compelled to pay fifty-five to seventy-five cents
per hundred by railroad. The western people
will say to their Representatives here that they
are not content with this Niagara ship-canal
alone unless they can also have with it such an
improvement as will relieve them from the
onerous taxation imposed by the railroads run-
ning from Chicago to the Mississippi river.
Therefore it is that I call the attention of the
House most earnestly to the improvement sug-
gested in my amendment. It is a perfectly
feasible improvement, as is shown by the report
of the engineer bureau of the War Depart-
ment, after a careful survey by one of the most
skillful engineers. I allude, of course, to Gen-
eral Warren. He reports that it is a feasible
improvement, and is the cheapest which can be
made for the purpose of connecting lake navi-
gation with the Mississippi river and its tribu-
taries. The river which it is proposed to im-
prove affords an unlimited amount of water
either for river or canal communication ; and
in the completion of this work the people from
St. Paul to the mouth of the Missouri river are
most deeply interested.
There is a difficulty in reference to this Ni-
agara ship-canal which I shall be glad to have
some one explain. The chairman having this
bill in charge tells us that if it is constructed
we must still rely on the New York canals for
the transportation of our products. I am in
favor of this Niagara ship-canal, because I pro-
pose that it shall be a complete water commu-
nication between the West and the Atlantic
ocean, so that we may transport our products,
our pork and our grain, to the markets of the
world without any intervention of the middle
men, who now impose such heavy charges upon
our people. Therefore, I say, if we are still to
rely upon the New York canals, we have then
gained but very little by providing for the con-
struction of this Niagara ship-canal, unless it
is proposed as a part of the system to enlarge
the Erie canal from Oswego to the Hudson,
and also to in some way secure an enlarge-
ment of Canadian canals leading to the river
St. Lawrence.
But, Mr. Speaker, my principal object in
seeking the floor is to impress upon the House
the importance of adopting the amendment I
have proposed, and I regret that the brief time
allotted to me will not permit me to elaborate
the arguments at hand in favor of this amend-
ment. The exhaustive speech of the gentle-
man from Wisconsin, [Mr. Paine,] made yes-
terday, shows the imperative necessity of this
improvement to meet the rapid development
of the prairie States especially affected by it.
I also wish to call attention of members to a
memorial from a canal convention recently
held in Prairie du Chien, at which these States
were represented, for facts and figures show-
ing the practicability and necessity of this
improvement presented to this House and
referred to the Committee on Commerce.
A glance at the statistics of production of
the five grain-growing States will show that a
large amount of tonnage would pass over this
route, and the effect of its completion would
be to create a cheap competing line, which
would at once have the effect to secure re-
duction of rates upon all the railroad lines
between the Mississippi river and Lake Michi-
gan. A table which I have gleaned from the
memorial of the canal-convention and have be-
fore alluded to, and which I will have printed
in the Globe, carefully compiled from reliable
data, shows the remarkable growth of these
five States since 1850, and with an increase in
the same ratio during the next ten years will
give to this line a tonnage almost equal to the
Erie canal in 1860. The very nature of these
products require cheap modes of communica-
tion :

It thus appears that a population of littlo
more than two millions in 1850, has increased
to four and a half millions in 1800, and to
nearly six millions in 18Gu; that the product
of wheat, eighteen million bushels in 1850, has
increased to nearly fifty-five millions in 58G0,
and to eighty-five millions in 1SG5 j and that
the product of grain, including wheat, &e.,
o'ie hundred and fifty-three million bushels in
1S50, has increased to three hundred and thirty-
two and a half millions in I860, and to four
hundred and thirty-nine and a half millions in
1865.
It also appears that less than one sixth part
of the population of the United States naa
raised more than one half of the wheat, about
