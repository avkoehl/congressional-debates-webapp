Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, a meeting
was held in the city of Baltimore 011 the 22d

are alleged to be violations of the rights of
naturalized citizens by some of the Govern-
ments of Europe, and particularly the Govern-
ment of England. Resolutions were adopted
by the meeting, which was very numerous and
very respectable; and one of them contains a
request that a committee should be appointed
to present a copy of them to their Senators
anrl Representatives in Congress, and take
such steps as they might deem necessary to
effect the. object of the meeting. I present

Mr. CHANDLER, from the Committee on
Commerce, to whom was referred the bill (H.
R. No. 785) to revive an act to constitute Han-
nibal, Missouri, and Peoria, Illinois, ports of

NORTHERN AND NORTHWESTERN LAKES.
Mr. CHANDLER,. The Committee on Com-
merce, to whom was referred the joint resolu-
tion (8. R. No. 108) relating to the survey of '
the northern and northwestern lakes, have
directed mo to report it back and rccommend
its passage ; and 1 ask unanimous consent of
the Senate to put it on its passage now.
There being no objection, the joint resolu-
tion was considered as in Committee of the
Whole. Its object is to provide that the sec-
ond section of the act making appropriations
for the construction, preservation, and repair
of certain fortifications and other works of de-
fense for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1808,
approved March 2, 1867, shall not apply to the
appropriation "for the survey of the northern
ancl northwestern lakes."
Mr. CHANDLER. I will merely state that
the fortification bill last year contained in one
of its items an appropriation of $155,000 for
the survey of the northern and northwestern
lakes. That was intended for the present
fiscal year, closing the 30th of June next, but
in the second section of that act was this pro-
viso, which was intended to apply solely to
fortifications:
"Provided, That there shnll not be over fifty per
cent, of the foregoing appropriations expended dur-
ing the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 18138, and
the residue thereof shall not bo expended until
otherwise ordered/'
That was not intended to apply to the ap-
propriation for the survey either of the coast
or of the lakes, but was intended to apply to
fortifications. The committee are unanimous
in recommending that this appropriation be
taken out from the effect of the proviso. One
half of the appropriation has been expended,
and of course nothing further can be done from
now until the 30th of June unless this clause
locking it up is repealed.
The joint resolution was reported to the j!
Senate, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.
SURVEY OF BAYOU MANCIIAC.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee 011 Print-
ing, to whom was referred a resolution for the
printing of additional copies of the report of
the Secretary of War, communicating the re-
port of Brigadier General M. D. Macalester, of
a survey of the Bayou Mauchac and Amite
river, have instructed me to report it back
without amendment and recommend its pas-
sage; and I ask for its present consideration.
There being 110 objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the following resolution:
Resolved, That throe thousand additional copies of
the report of the Secretary of W ar communicating the
report of Brigadier General M. J).Macalester, maj,or
of engineers, of a survey of the Bayou Manehae and
Amite river, with the maps accompanying the report,

maps be also printed to accompany the regular edi-
tion.

Mr. ANTHONY. The Amit6 river that
runs into Lake Ponchartrain.

chairman of the Committee on Printing how
much that will cost?

six dollars and fifty cents.
The resolution was adopted.

WESTERN PACIFIC RAILROAD.
Mr. CONNESS. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill No.
159.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (S. No. 159) relating to the
Western Paeilic railroad. The bill as origin-
ally introduced proposed to authorize the West-
ern Pacific Railroad Company to locate the
western terminus of its railroad and telegraph
lines at Yorba Buena Island, on the Bay of
San Francisco, and for this purpose to grant to
the company, its successois and assigns, such
portion of the island as shall not be required
and selected within one year from its passage
for the purpose of fortifications, by authority
of the President of the United States. It also
proposed to authorize the Western Pacific Rail-
road Company to locate and construct a rail-
road thence, by the shortest and most practi-
cable route, to a point on its present line at or
south of the city of Stockton, and to enfran-
chise them with all the grants, privileges, and
benefits, and made subject to all the conditions
of the several acts of Congress relating to the
company and its railroad and telegraph line;
but nothing herein contained was to be so con-
strued as to increase the subsidies in bonds
beyond that accruing under existing lines of
location and laws heretofore passed providing
for the construction of the Pacific railroad.
The Committee on the Pacific Railroad re-
ported the bill with an amendment, to strike
out after the word "that," in the third line
of the bill, the following words:
The AVestern Pacific Kailroad Company be, and
is hereby, authorized to locate the v/ettern terminus
of its railroad and telegraph lines at Yerba Buena
Island, ill the Bay of San i'raneisco, and for such
puiposc there is hereby granted to the said company,
it* successors and assigns, such portion of the said
island as shall not be required and selected within
one year from the passage of this act for the pur-
pose of fortifications, by authority of the President
of the United States.
And to insert in lieu thereof the following:
The Western Pacific Railroad Company of Califor-
nia be, and is hereby, permitted to occupy lor the pur-
poses of a depot, storehouses, and other necessary
fixtures so much of the island known as Yerba Buena
orGoatlsland.in thcBay of San Francisco, California,
as may, within one year from the time this act shall
take effect., bodesignated by the General of the Army
of the United States, with the approval of the Secre-
tary of War, as not being required in time of peace
for military purposes; which privilege shall, how-
