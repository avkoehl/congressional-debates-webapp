Cross-examined by Mr. Manager Buti.eii:
Question. IIow long have you been troubled
with your unfortunate affliction ?
Answer. To what do you refer.
Question. I understoodyou were a little deaf.
Is that so?
Anstoer. I have been sick the greater part
of this year, and was compelled to come here
a month ago almost, before i was able to come.
I have not got well yet.
Question. Did you hear my question?
Answer. Yes.
Question. How long have you been deaf, if
you have been deaf at all ?
Ansioer. Partially deaf for the last two years,
I should think.
Question. About what time did it commcnce?
Answer. I cannot state that.
Question. As near as you can. You know
when you became deaf, do you not?
Answer. I know I was not deaf when you
made your St. Louis speech in 1SGG.
Question. That is a very good date to reckon
from ; but as these gentlemen do not all know
when that was, and you and I do, suppose you
try it by the almanac and tell us when that
was?
Answer. That was 011 the 13th of October,
1800.
Question. You were not deaf then?
Answer. No.
Question. How soon after that did you
become deaf?
Answer. Perhaps a month. [Laughter.]
Question. You are quite sure it was not at
that time?
Answer. Quite sure it was not that time,
because I heard some remarks the crowd
made which you did not. [Laughter.]
Question. I have no doubt you heard very
much that I did not. Now, suppose we Con-
nor the judges
I know there are somo
thiit talk
And manago nil the
affairsof Stato
Tho pooplo of Missouri
as well as other States
know that all my
efforts have
all this
traduction and de-
traction tliat/iase
let us tight the jnomios
And in parting with
you now /leavetho
government in your
hands
recognized
fine ourselves to this matter. About a month
after that you became deaf?
Answer. Partially.
Question. Partially deaf, as now.
Answer. I recovered from that sickness. I
became sick again the first part of this year.
Question. Now, will you have tho kindness
to state whether you have your notes ?
The Witness. Of the President's speech?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Yes, sir.
Answer. 1 have not.
Question. When did you see them last ?
Answer. The last recollection I have of
them is when Mr. Walbridge was summoned
before the Reconstruction Committee to give
testimony on the New Orleans riot.
Question. Did you and he then go over that
speech together?
Answer. We went over only a part of it.
Question. The part that referred to New
Orleans?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. But the part that referred to New
Orleans you went over with him ?
Answer. I did.
Question. Was there any material difference
between you and him when you had your notes
together in that part of the speech, and if so,
state what ?
A nswer. There was.
Question. What was it ?
Answer. He asked mc to compare notes
with him 
Question. Excuse mo ; I am not asking what
he said. I am asking what difference there
was between your report and his report upon
that comparison; what material difference?
Mr. EVAKTS. I submit, Mr. Chief Justice,
that as he is asked Jhe precise question what
the difference was that arose upon that com-
parison, he is to be permitted to stato what it
was and how it arose.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I have not asked
any difference that arose between him and Mr.
Walbridge. Far be it from me to go into that.
1 have asked what tho difference was between
the two speeches.
Mr. E VARTS. As it appeared in that com-
parison.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. As found at that
time.
The Witxess. That is what I was going to
answer. If you will possess your soui in
patience a moment 1 will answer.
The Oil I Eh' JUSTICE. The witness will
confine himself entirely to what is asked and
make no remarks.
The Witness. When we proceeded to com-
pare that part relating to the New Orleans riot
Mr. Walbridge read from his notes; I looked
on, and when he came to this passage, as near
as I can remember: "When you read the
speeches that were made, and take up the facts,
if they are as stated, you will find that speeches
were made incendiary in their character, ex-
citing that population called the black popu-
lation to take up arms and prepare for the
shedding of blood ;" I called Mr. Walbridge's
attention to the qualifying words, " if the facts
are as stated." He replied to me, "You are
mistaken ; I know I am right," and went on.
As he was summoned to swear to his notes, and
not to mine, I did not argue the question with
him further, but let him go on.
By Mr. Manager Butlkr:
Question. What other difference was there?
Answer. There was another difference.
Question. In the New Orleans matter?
Answer. Yes sir. The President's words,
I think, were that they there knew a conven-
tion was to be called which was extinct by
reason of its power having expired. There
was a difference in the words "by reason of.''
Question. What was that difference?
Answer. The words "by reason of."
Question. Were they in or out of Walbridge's
report?
Answer. They were in my report.
Question. And were not in Walbridge's re-
port?
Answer. They were not.
Question. Any other difference?
Answer. No other. That was as far as we
proceeded with the report as to the New Or-
leans riot. The latter part of the report was
not compared at all, nor was the first part.
Question. Now, have you the report as it
appeared in the Republican of Monday morn-
ing before you?
Answer. I have.
Question. Let me read the first few senten ces
of the report put in evidence, and tell me how-
many errors there are in that. Have you it ?
Answer. Yes, sir; I have it. [The witness
produced a new paper.]
Question. Now, I will read from the report
put in evidence here:
"Fellow-citizens of St. Louis: In being intro-
duced to you to-night, it is not for the purpose of
making a speech. It is true I am proud to meet so
many of my fcllow-citizens here on this occasion,
and under the favorable circumstances that I do.
[Cry, 'How about British subjects? ] We will at-
tend to John Bull after awhile, so far as that is con-
cerned. [Laughter and loud choers.] I have just
stated that I was not here for the purpose of making
a speech."
The Witness. "Am not here."
Mr. Manager BUTLER. The difference is
here "I was," and there "I am." Now, do
you know that the President used the word
"am" instead of "was?"
Answer. Of course I do.
Question. I will read on:
"I was not hero for the purpose of making a speech;
but after being introduced simply to tender my cor-
dial thanks for the welcome you have given mo in
your midst. [A voice: 'Ten thousand welcomes;'
hurrahs and cheers.] Thank you, sir. I wish itwasin
my power to address you under favorablo circum-
stances upon snino of the questions that agitate and
distract the public mind at this time" 
Answer. " Questions which agitate."
Question. " Which agitate" instead of" that
agitate ?''
Answer. Yes.
Question. And then it goes on:
" Questions that have grown out of a fiery ordeal
we have just passed through, and which I think as
important as thoso wehavojust passed by. The time
has come when it seems to me that all ought to bo pro-
pared for peace—the rebellion being suppressed, and
the shedding of blood being stopped, the sacrifice of
life being suspended and stayed, it seems that the
time has arrived when we should have peace; when
tho bleeding arteries should bo tied up. [A voice :
' Now Oi'leans'Go on.'J"
It is so far all right except those two cor-
rections ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Now we will try another part?
The Witxess. Go over the New Orleans
part, if you please. I wish to make a correction
in that part.
Question. Are you dealing with a memo-
randum?
Answer. It is the official proceedings.
Question. You are comparing yourself with
the official proceedings as you go on, where
you have noted these corrections ?
Answer. Yes, sir, in the official proceedings.
Question. Then you are going on with a copy
of the official proceedings and noting the
differences ?
Answer. Yes ; but I can make the memo-
randa without the official proceedings before
me. Do you want it? [Offering the printed
official report of the trial, with manuscript
corrections, to the honorable Manager. ]
Mr. Manager BUTLER. No; I do not care
for it. You told me that you wished I should
go on with tho New Orleans part. Why do you
wish anything about it?
The Witxess. You were proceeding to make
corrections, and when you came to the New
Orleans part you stopped.
By Mr. Manager Butler :
Question. Well, I will take this portion of
it 
The Witxess. Any portion.
Question. "Judaas, Judas Iscariot, Ju-
daas ?"
Answer. One Judas too many there. [Laugh-
ter.]
Question. 11 There was a Judas once." You
ax-e sure he did not speak Judas four times, are
you?
