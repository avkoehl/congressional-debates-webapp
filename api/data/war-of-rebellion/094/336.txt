Major E. B. BEAUMONT,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have found a splendid camp; lots of shelter and forage. Am close against General Croxton's right; his men, the Eighth Iowa being his right flank regiment, had gone into camp and was feeding when my staff officer arrived from General Wilson. Striking a due south course, I am two miles and a half from Richland Creek and one mile and a half from the pike. The bearer will bring orders. The people think that Richland Creek is fordable in my front.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

A good many rebel fugitives have gone toward Campbellsville, four miles from here.
