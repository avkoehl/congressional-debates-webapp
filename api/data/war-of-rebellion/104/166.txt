HEADQUARTERS, March 31, 1865.

Captain LUDWICK:

Send word to Lieutenant Denicke to signal Admiral Thatcher to open fire, if he has not already, and to aim pretty well to his left, to avoid injuring our troops.

S. M. EATON,Captain, &amp;c.

[MARCH 31, 1865.]

Captain EATON:

There is evidently preparations for planting a field battery at the place I indicated. My men just saw six horses pass to the left or six spans of horses. There is a telegraph station on this wood barge. The captain of the picket reports to me that he has seen lights on her at night and row-boats go from her to Huger. He recommends a host be put into her. Another transport is coming down. A blockade-runner has stopped at the ram.

M. ADAMS, JR.,

Lieutenant, &c.

EXTREME RIGHT BATTERIES, March 31, 1865-8.30 a. m.

Captain S. M. EATON:

We have the range on the ram very well. She has fired but two shots and is moving up the steam. No shells from the fort guns have got safely out of the way. The ram, like the Tennessee, fires only half way across. Our shots on the ram don't seem to affect her, although several have struck her. I am at the left of the batteries in a ravine; a good place for observation. The fort guns have got the range well. We have now opened on the fort.

Major-General CANBY:

From what I can discover, the old barracks on the north side of the ravine are on fire. I will ascertain positively and report presently in person.
