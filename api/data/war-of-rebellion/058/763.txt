DALTON, February 18, 1864.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET:

I am ordered to re-enforce Lieutenant-General Polk, and therefore shall not be able to do what you ask.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DALTON, February 18, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

Richmond:

Your dispatch received and will be obeyed as promptly as possible. Could General Beauregard re-enforce here temporarily? Colonel Anderson's cavalry regiment would be very valuable here. I have nothing from General Polk since the 16th. Please inform me.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DEMOPOLIS, February 18, 1864.

Hon J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

General Maury reports he has six months' supply for his garrison. In addition I have sent and am sending him about half a million pounds of bacon; also a large quantity of corn. I shall continue to add to his stores.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

DALTON, February 18, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

(Care of Major McGivern), Demopolis:

Inform me by telegraph where re-enforcements can find you and of the enemy's movements.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DEMOPOLIS, February 18, 1864.

General JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

I cannot read your cipher. Suppose our key-word not the same. My last key-word began with "our." If it is changed send it to me.
