trains. One should be undertaken and completed before the other is begun. The corduroy should be of the most permanent kind-three heavy stringers or sleepers, then the cross-pieces or corduroy of logs, not less then 8 or 10 inches in diameter, tied at proper distances by forks.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 10, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER,

Stevenson:

Please cause the post quartermaster to send us daily reports of all trains arriving and departing, either for freight or forage,specifying the numbers of wagons and the amount of freight or forage brought in or sent out. The same kind of report for railroad trains. Send for Captain Baker, assistant quartermaster; tell him that, if he fails in future to answer calls for information from Colonel Mackay, assistant quartermaster, or any other staff officer writing from these headquarters,he will be apt to lose his commission.

Major-General HOOKER,

Stevenson:

What news from the tunnel and up the road? The rebel cavalry may have dispersed in gangs, and in that case we may expect them across into the Sequatchie again, if they can get there. Notice should be given in all directions so soon as the facts warrant the apprehension.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, October 10, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

Say to the general that the tunnel is all right and the track through clear. Earth and stones were thrown into the tunnel through the cowardice of the officer in command at that point. He is under arrest. The road was threatened last night by Roddey's force, which crossed the river below and passed through Larkinsville yesterday morning. I dispatched 1,000 men from Bridgeport to anticipate the attack, but owing, I think, to want of power in the locomotive, failed to reach their destination in season to be of service. I cannot learn of any further division of the enemy's forces.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
