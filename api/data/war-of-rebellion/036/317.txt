JACKSON, MISS., January 28, 1863.

Colonel [J. GORGAS, Richmond, Va.:

Please order the 4,000 arms required for by Major [George Upshur]

Mayo sent here without delay. They are indispensable at this juncture.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, MISS., February 5, 1863.

Colonel J. GORGAS, Richmond, Va.:

I fear you do not appreciate the importance of meeting ordnance requisitions for this department. A constant supply of field and small arm ammunition (especially buck and ball) must come. I want 1,000,000 percussion-caps immediately.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General.

JACKSON, MISS., April 16, 1863.

Colonel [J.] GORGAS, Richmond, Va.:

I have a battalion of sharpshooters without arms. Can you let me have three hundred Enfield rifles to arm them? I need a number of small-arms for unarmed men in my department.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, MISS., April 18, 1863.

Colonel J. GORGAS, Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:

If ammunition for the three 9-inch guns is not sent with them, they will be useless to me. Have heard nothing from you of bolts for the Brooks gun now here. Without bolts it had as well been left in Richmond. I have no coal, and am unable to obtain any.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, MISS., April 19, 1863.

Colonel J. GORGAS, Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:

The dimensions for eyes for shells is not uniform. Please have the shells fixed with fuses, or have the eyes uniform. Order extra sabots, as many are broken by railroad in transportation. Different arsenals make the eyes larger or smaller than prescribed; should be corrected. Friction-primers frequently fail.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, &amp;c.

JACKSON, MISS., April 23, 1863.

Colonel J. GORGAS, Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:

Have but one 10-inch mortar, but can throw incendiary shells from 10-inch and 8-inch columbiads. Send me as many as you can, and powder, or, better, cartridges with them.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
