General Thomas to threaten the Buzzard Roost Pass; to occupy in force the Tunnel Hill Ridge, the roads leading from Buzzard Roost toward Trickum and Catoosa; also to keep up communication with Villanow; the treats on Buzzard Roost not to lead to battle unless the enemy comes out of his works; to get, if possible, a small force on Rocky Face Ridge. General Schofield to occupy the gap at Lee's and Varnell's, and to feel from Lee's along down Rocky Face to the enemy's signal station if possible. General McPherson to move through Villanow and occupy Snake Creek Gap to its strongest point, and to get up his (Garrard's) cavalry, if possible, for the next day's work. If the enemy leave Buzzard Roost Gap General Thomas will follow direct, and General Schofield through Lee's Gap, toward Dalton, on the east side of Rocky Face Ridge, viz, by Crow's Valley.

General Kilpatrick is at Trickum, with Williams' division; Buttterfield and Geary on their right, I presume in position by this time. Have had the railroad examined between here and Ringgold; the track is all right. Second bridge from here has four trestles and some stringers destroyed. Third bridge from here has two stringers and some ties destroyed. Fourth bridge all destroyed. Railroad will be in running order to fourth bridge to-night. Road through tunnel to our picket-line, one mile beyond, in good order. Have ordered Wright to push forward repairs as rapidly as possible.
