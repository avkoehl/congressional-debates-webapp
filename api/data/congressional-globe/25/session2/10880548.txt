Both íepoits state
"That the commutee concui in the views of Piesident Jack
son, m h s annual message to the two Houses of Congress in
18Í5 in wh ch e s lys It stems to be tht ti ue policy that the
public la ids shitl cease as soon as practicable to be a source of
levenue, and that they be sold to settteis in limited paicels, at
a puce bately sumcient to reimbuise to the United States the
expenses ot the present system, and cost ¿using under our Ih
dian comp tets
This pioposinon, so ruinous to the old States, and I believe to
the naw ii adapted was used by the President, when there was
an overfl iwing suiplusm theTieasury This language is now
quoted and used, m the iep>itofthi(>3ession when the Tieasuiy
i& bankrupt and has not one dollai of gold orsdvei in it but
what is puicnased, and is dnven to the shift ef issuing a suspi
cious kind of paper money To reduce the pile** ei the West
ei i land-* would be to invite all who desire to purchase Govern
ment land to delay making pmchasps until the limitation of the
time shall expne, when the lauds may be entered at the low
pu e of twenty bve cents peí ai re which is proposed , and in
the mean time it will force thov* who have aheady purchased,
for the purpose oí reselling, to hsposeoi then lands ata reduced
piiee So, wlnl3t it will destroy in a great degree ail revenue
to the Government by sales u will have the tendency of ruining
many w ho have purchased of the Government upon its faith to
continue the present system and the piesent price
How gentlemen can sacrifice the interests ol so laige a poi
tiou oi then constituency by sustaining such a piopo&ition, to
indulge the avaricious longings of another portion, is not my
business to mqutio     Oi how tiny membei ftom any of the old
States can countenance, with the slightest loo , of approbation,
such a mea'uue, puzzles my julgment    What maxim of polit
ical economy will justify it?  What principle of íeaaon ?  What
sentiment of jn-^ioe %   I am slow to believe that motives of
policy which war upoi sound leasonand stuct justice can in
duce it*, suppoit, or that the consultations of mteiestedinflu
enees, which have ultenoi hopes and sinister obji>{ ts, will wat
lxnt s)gieit a depaume from the faith of the com[ icts,oiso

II to* re )o anv nit mber on this floor fiom an o d S'ate who
"de*pi es his buthrtght,' I would repudiate the belief that lam

The behest oi a party, if given, coul 1 never, 1 hope, induce

"Nor c >ull the commmd oi any tnhvtdual hivever e\iltel

on this suijeit Political triumphs or delcats should never

the "5w us at the setting sun nor like the Persian at the using
I would look m:> e at t! in°s than ppisons, leos upon men than
their measure-- ail severely tsuutmue both I cannot adopt
the di lo nacy oi the Scntrh n m m the Man of the World, who
could neiPt stand tttaiqht in the presence of a great man 1
wo aid pi Ige of virtuous men by their acts, and of public men
by the wis lorn of their measuies He who acts upon measures
hv pi ciple, and makes the broad andenduuns interest of the

be wit i the many oi the fow, so long as he has tbe approbation
of an u i right and approving conscience that affoids him aburi
dant" isolation, an 1 if p'aced mietuenient, he can then truly
say w th the Precian, that he never feels less alone than when
alr>ne
O a t ns occasion I cannot but allude to what I considei a false
position which Geneial Tackssnis made to take by the report of
the On nmittee on the Public Lands at rbis session
Cien i lackson predicated his reasons m f?vor of a reduc
tion of the puce oi the public lands upon the gtound that they
fuirtshela suiplus íevenue made an overflowing Treasury ,
an 1' <* thought that an evil won d result to the na ion fiom an
ea¿ei ivihty on the part of the States to be possessed of the
dis nb uabltsurplus Otheis, [know, thoaght tnathis teasons
%/ere more of a personal character, because some of his dis
trngui* ied oppnn nta advocated a distubutton ofthesaiplus
'evenu amone the vaiious States I am willing to believe
that tlv oimer weie the reason^ whTch induced the recomí ien
dation n    is menage
Uo not i committee perceive that the leasons urged by the
Piesident r that time aie mapplicab'e now' Whe e is
vour suip ? treasure now? Have you a redundancy
of money 11 the lieasuiy at tins time 1 is if ovet
lío wing, as it was a few years age1* It cannot ha\e been ior
gotten that v i passed a bil1 at the extra session 11 withnold the
irnthmQral lent of the distribution act, upon the snoundihat
the Tie fury was bankrupt it cannot be foigotteu that you
ptsse la bill' > authorise the Secretary of the treasury to is
sue ten tmlli i  of Ireasuiy notes All know that the chair
man ol the I nancial Committee has reponed a bill to is°ite
anothei tf n m 'lions Then, when the Tteasury is delinquent
some twent) \ nilions how pan the arguments of General Jack
son apph w i b weiepiedicatpd upon asm plus of some forty
miliums? Th*1 committee should recollect there wasnodis met

cation, the propositions were differatt tó\d compouxu Nor
was theie a simple and defiaife ^roposittpñ of tfts character
when Mr Van Bqreu wr^te his kwu message As limited aa
my favorable option is of ooth of those distinguished pevson
ages, as %v^e anu practical statesmen, I do not believe that
vw i of them could be so unmindful of the public interest, so
deaf to the Toice of the indigent, so cruel to the offspring of
the needy, so indifferent to the interest of all of the States, a«
not to give a cordial sanction to a measure which would exalt
the condition of all, by carrying education to every habitation
in the nation Had the direct pioposition been submitted to
Geneial Jackson to distlibute among the States, upon some
equitable basis, the whole proceeds of the public lands, as a
permanent fund for educational purposes, I have no doubt in
my mind that he would cordially have approved of it Were
it submitted to Ml Van Buier, 1 fully believe that he would
sanction it They have both usen from the plain md humble
walks of life to the first honors of the nation, and they could
not be so unnatural as to airest the facilities which general
education would afford to the humble poor as well as to the
moie fortunate m life
The proposition which I have offered is to extend to the old
States the like quantity of the pubhc lands which have been
given to the new It goes further itpioposes ai ippiopri
ation of an additional quantity to all the States and Teiu
tones without specifying the precise amount
It is ¡he principle and the policy oí the measuie which I
have thought sufficient for the piesent to discus, without em
barrassmg it with detallo leaving the la'ter to be adjusted by
the commit ee which the House may charge with the subject
I have no hesitancy in s atmg, howevei that I should prefei
that the whole proceeds of the sales of the public íanüs should
be set apart for the exclusive support of academies and com
mon schools in all of the States Such propositions have been
made, as I will piesently show, at various times
If the same amount should be distubuted x> tbe o'd which
the new States have íeceived, they would receive, as the follow
ing table will show, which may not m all respects be accmatp,
the following amounts
