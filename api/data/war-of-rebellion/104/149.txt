HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865.

Major-General CANBY:

General Smith is very anxious that the 10-inch siege mortars should go to General Carr's front instead of against Battery Huger, having little confidence in their efficiency against the latter, and being desirous of a mortar fire against Spanish Fort. What are your wishes?

M. D. MCALESTER,

Captain and Chief Engineer.

Lieutenant Colonel J. ALLEN,

General Smith's Headquarters:

When you have located a mortar battery near the 30-pounder Parrotts get it ready for the reception of the platforms, making use of the details now at work on the 30-pounder Parrott batteries after they complete the latter.

M. D. MCALESTER,

Captain and Chief Engineer.
