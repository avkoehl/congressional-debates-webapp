their proper commands. I have a great deal to do here, and have only 1,700 infantry, with two corps d'armee in my front pressing up night and day.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Liddell, Blakely.)
HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 1, 1865.

General GIBSON,

Spanish Fort:

General Maury has ordered me to send no more men to Spanish Fort, and to withdraw Ector's brigade. I do not know his object. Our lines are 2,000 yards long, and I have not enough men here by 1,000 to man our fortifications, and Steele's corps is reported to be larger than both corps in front of your works.

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 1, 1865.

General GIBSON,

Spanish Fort:

General Maury has directed me to withdraw at once Ector's brigade from Spanish Fort to this place, for which purpose I send you one of the blockaders to-night, and you will have the men ready to embark at once, as the enemy from above is closing around me. Acknowledge receipt of this at once.

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SPANISH FORT, April 1, 1865-9.30 p. m.

Major-General MAURY,

Mobile:

Much the largest force of the enemy is here (two corps). This place is closely invested and weaker by far than Blakely. Large detachments from Holtzclaw's brigade are at Blakely. The losses in my own have been heavy. There are already many more troops at Blakely than here. Can't you let me keep Ector's brigade a day or two longer? The withdrawal of it just now renders this position hazardous in the extreme. Answer.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Brigadier General St. J. R. Liddell, Blakely, and Colonel G. G. Garner, chief of staff.)
