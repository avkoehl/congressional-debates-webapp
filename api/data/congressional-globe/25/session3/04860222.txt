APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 19,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Lands—Mr. Parker.
Ho. of Reps.
Piesident, tins has been, and is now, a nullity to
us, for Gieat Britain, through the medium of the
Hudson'^ Bay Company, has built and armed
several forts, equipped ships, erected houses, and
improved farms, and opened a trade with all the
tribes of Indian's on the western slope of the
Rocky Mountains, as far south as the Gulf of
California Their hunters and tiappers have pen-
etrated alt the valleys and glens of the Rocky
mountain's, scattering arms, munitions of war,
and fomenting discontent against the United States
in the bosoms of those distant Indian tribes They
have driven our people from the Indian trade,
which yielded seven or eight hundred thousand
dollars per annum, and even pushed their opera-
tions east of the Rocky mountains to the great
Mississippi valley. To all of these aggressions
we tamely submit. They have ruined our fur
bade, and seem disposed to appropriate the for-
ests of Mame to thtir own use
I was mistaken when I said we quietly submit
to these lnjuues Our Yankee friends to the
northeast aie now showing a proper degree of in-
dignation at British insolence and outiage, and
manifesting a piopei degree of war spirit This
is right, foi I believe, with the member of the
Irish Pailiament, (when she had one,) that the
best way to avoid danger, is to meet it plump in
the face The English now claim exclusive pos-
session and junsdiction over a part of the State
of Maine, have entire possession and use of the
Oregon territory, and have extended their laws
over it, even to the confines of Missouu and
Aikansas Not satisfied with these aggressions,
they liberated the slaves of southern gentlemen,
when the ship that contained them was wrecked
on the íeefs of the Bahama Isles Mr Presi-
dent, if all our complaints and causes for collision
with Great Britain weie put togethei, I think the
world would bear us harmless should we resort
*o the ultimate redress for wrongs Jlnd should
war evei take place between, the two counti les, I hope
i< will not cease until she is <!> men from the continent
For my part, when 1 look back to the period
when our sailors had to carry paras when travels-
ing the wide ocean—which pass was often torn
up and thrown in the sailor's face by some up-
start midshipman, who impiessed him into the
Bntish service in defiance of his Amuiean ; o
tectum, as. it wus called, to the muidir of our
riuzins in our own waleis, in tin sight oí our
ownsliousi to the burning and plundcung of
oui ships- on the public highway of nations, tin
ocem, tin arming and exciting the Indims io
muidir and scalp ova women and childun, and
devasiate our fionticr, with a thousand othei in-
sults and injuries, past and present, ive have
received at her hands, no wise, I assure you,
Mr Piesident, disposes me to foiget and foigive
so haughty, insulting, grasping, and unjust a
Government
As regards this bill, I shall make no motion,
leaving it in the hands of the Senate, as many
esteemed fuends around and near me seem to
think that, at this cntieal moment, the passage
of the bill might be misconstrued But 1 pledge
myself not to permit our claims to this tcintoiy
to slumber
Mr   Piesident, I am far, very far, from desir-
ing war with Great Britain,  but I would not
avoid it by a truckling policy or a mean submis
eion to insult or injury
On motion of Mr WRIGHT, the bill was
committed to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions
PUBLIC LANDS
SPEECH OF HON. A J. PARKEK,
OF MEW YORK,
Iv the House or Representatives,
February 19 and 20, 1839
The following resolutions, reported by the belect Com
miltec on the Public Lands, being under consideration
Resohcd That the committee report to tht House, and
ask leave to be di-charged from tin further consideration
o' the sulject matters referred to them, and that the jour
n li of the committee be reported and published
Kesolicl f other J llal Hie com mate deem it mexpe
dient to take further stepson the&ubjeu of the public lands
this session ,
Mr. PARKER said   As a member of the se-
lect committee on the public lands, and as a Rep-
resentative from a Sta*e having so large an interest
in the disposition of that subject, I may claim a
small portion of the time of the House, while I
state the reasons which led me to concur in the
report of the committee, and why I shall oppose
1he amendatory propositions of the gentleman
fiom Missouri [Mr Harrison] and the gentle-
man from Virginia, [Mr Robertson ] I occupy,
Mr Speaker, a middle ground between these two
gentlemen, by no means yielding to the extraor-
dinary doctrine of the former, and equally un-
convinced of the propriety of the measure advo-
cated by the latter The fifth resolution of the
member fiom Missouri, is as follows:
" Resolved therefore, As the States of this Confederacy,
'in all respects whatever, are equallj free, sovereign, and
independent,' no conditions being imposed or required by
the Constitution upon those thatmight be admitted into the
Union, that all restrictions and conditions upon the new
States, on their admission, being opposed to the funda
mental punciples and analogies ot the Government and not
sanctioned by the Constitution, arc null and void, and that
each new State,upon being admitted into the Union, being
' as free, sovereign, tnd independent as the other Statr s, m
all respects wh itever ' was absolved by the act of admis
«ion, from all terms conditions,restrictions, and limitations
whatever, whether under deeds of cession, ordinances or
compacts nnd becamt, ipso facto, the absolute, unqual
lfied and uneontroJl lble sovereign of the soil lying withm
its respective limits andjuusdictmn "
He claims that all the public lands lying in the
new States belong, of tight to those States—that
the ownership of the soil of the vacant lands ne-
cessauly results from the sovereignty of a State,
and is msepaiably connected with its political
jurisdiction This is a bold doctrine, Mr Speak-
er, but I believe it is not entirely new
Several yeais ago, when a graduation bill was
under discussion in the Senate, an amendment
involving the same principle was proposed by a
Senator from Indiana, but, after some discussion,
it was withdrawn I am told, also, that a pam-
phlet was published, about the same time, by a
Governor of one of the westein States, in which
the same doctrine was advocated But in all the
discubsion that has taken place on this floor on
the subject of the public lands, no such monstrous
pioposition has ever befoie been asserted It
may be a very convcnientdoctiine for the gentle-
man fiom Missouri, and I doubt not hisaigument
will meet the coidial approbation of those whom
heiepnsents The glittenng puze he exhibits
may loi a time dazzle the eyes of his constituents,
and prevent then looking on this question with
ímpaiutility If the punciple contended for is
iccogmzed, the State of Missouu Vould ímme-
diaiely become the owner of more than thnty
tlnee million acres of the public land now re
mauling unsold withm its limits But I cannot
believe it will ever leceive the sanction of this
House oi of the nation
If the doctrine cited from Vattel by the gentle-
man from Missouri, [Mi Harrisov,] viz "that
the ownership of the soil of all the waste lands is
a neeessaryattiibtiteofthe sovereignty of aState,"
was ever applicable to the lands in this country,
it could only have been when we were emerging
from the condition of colonics, and assuming the
position of independent States It was then that
these States, as they became sovereign, became
at the same time the owneis of all the unappro-
pnated lands within their limits Fiom this
souice is derived the present title of the redera!
Government, resting entuely upon contiact, and
not upon any assumed exeicise of jurisdiction
At the time of the Revolution, the public lands
(with the exception of those since purchased fiom
Fiance and Spam) were claimed by the States,
and these claims constituted the principal obstacle
in foiming the Confederation Seven! of the
States, that made no claim to the vacant lands,
contended that they should be considered the
common property of the United States, alid Maiy-
hnd did not yield her assent to the Articles of
Confederation until March, 1781
The first movement on the subject of ceding the
unappiopnatcd lands, wii¡> made by the State of
New York, in March, 1780, when the Legislature
of that State passed an act tendering to the United
Stales a cession of us claims to the western terri-
tory
Ihis was followed by resolutions of Congress,
one of which, passed on the 10th of Octobei, 1780,
contained a pledge as to the manner in which the
lands that might be ceded by the States should be
disposed of, and was as follows:
"Resolved, That the unappropriated lands which may be
ceded or relinquished to the United St ues bv an> particular
State, p irsuant to the recommendation of Congress of the
6th dayof September laM shall be disposed ot lor the com
mon benefit of the United States and be settled md formed
into di tinct republican States, «Inch shall become mem
hers of the Fedeiaf Union,' ¡k.c
In consequence of this pledge, and íelyíng on
the good faith of the Tederal Govei nment, cessions
weie made by the seveial States that claimed the
unappiopnated land
The deed of cession from the State of New
York was executed on the 1st of March, 1781,
one of the conditions of which was, that the lands
ceded " shall be and mure for the use and benefit
of such of the United States as shall become mem-
bers of the Federal alliance of the said States, and
for no othei use or purpose whatsoever "
The Vnginia deed of cession, which was exe-
cuted on the 1st March, 1784, contained the fol-
lowing condition
" That all the lands withm the territory as ceded to the
United States," &c ,£i shall be considere I as a common fund
for the use and benefit of such of the United States as hate
become, or shall become, members of the Confederacy or Fed
eral alliance oj the said States, Virginia inclusive, according
to their usual respective proportions in the general charge
and expen lltui e, and shall be faithfully and bona fide dis
posed of for that purpote, and for no other use or purpose
whatsoever "
A similar condition was contained in all the
subsequently executed deeds of cession the deed
of Massachusetts being executed in 1785, of Con-
necticut in 1786, of South Carolina in 1787, of
North Carolina in 1789, and of Georgia not till
1802
On the 13th of July, 1787, Congress passed an
ordinance for the goveinment of the territory of
the United States northwest of the river Ohio, the
fourth article of which contained the following
provision
"The Legislatures of those districts or new States, shall
never mterlere with the primary disposal of the soil by the
Unit d States m Congress as embled, nor with any regula
lion Congress mav fin 1 necessary, foi seeur n¿ the title m
such soil in the bonafi Ic purcln ers No tat shall be lm
posed on lands the property ot the United States," &c
It is contended by the gentleman from Mis-
souri that this pait of the oidinance of 1787 is
void and inoperative, because it is, as he says, a
violation of the compact with Virginia, inasmuch
as the deed of cession from Vnginia does not ex-
pressly authonze the United States to retain the
unsold land in the new States, and to hold it
exempt from taxation Now, I deny that this
clause in the ordinance is at all inconsistent with
the deed from Virginia On the contiary, these
lands could not be held asa "common fund," for
the use and benefit of all the States, as required
by the deed, except in the manner specified in the
ordinance To surrender the lands to the new
States would violate the condition of the deed of
cession, by depriving the old States of their share
in this common fund Such a disposition of the
public lands would not opeiate for the benefit of
all the States, "according to their usual respect-
ive proportions of the general charge of expend
lture," and as evidence that Virginia undeistood
her deed of cession as authorizing the Federal
Government to retain the right of soil m the un-
sold lands in the new States, I call the attention
of my friend from Missouri to some resolutions
passed by Congress as early as the 23d April,
1784, relating to the new States that should be
formed in the Northwest Territory, m which the
same ícseivations as to thenghtof soil,and hold-
ing the lands exempt fiom taxation, weie ex-
piessly made These resolutions were passed
during the month next succeeding that m which
the cession was made The acts weie almost
simultaneous, and the same delegates from Vir-
ginia, who executed-the deed of cession, weie
members of the Congress that passed the resolu-
tions It cannot, therefoie, be supposed there
existed at that time any difference of opinion as
to the right of the Geneial Government to make
these reservations
Mi HARRISON said that the provisions of
the ordinance of 1787 were never sanctioned by
the State of Vnginia
Mr PARKER I will satisfy the honorable
member fiom Missouri that he is in error on this
point   On the 30th of December, 1788, an act was
