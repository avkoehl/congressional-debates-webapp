in the direction of Lamar, with instructions to report to Major-General Curtis. One regiment, First Cavalry Missouri State Militia, of my brigade, having been detached at fort Scott to guard prisoners and artillery to Warrensburg, I sent forward couriers, with a dispatch to General Curtis informing him of my approach, and that I would close up as speedily as the jaded condition of my stock would allow.

On the afternoon of the 28th I received an order from Major-General Pleasonton to return by Fort Scott to Warrensburg. Accordingly I countermarched, reaching Warrensburg on the evening of the 2nd of November, my command having marched since it entered upon this campaign 1,000 miles.

I submit herewith the report of Brigade Surgeon Trader, showing the list of casualties of the two days' engagements.*

I cannot close this report without expressing my recognition of the very valuable services of my regimental commanders in securing the successes of the brigade. They were brave, prompt, and full of energy and moved their commands with skill, and fought with the at the very front. At the battle of the Big Blue Lieutenant-Colonel Crittenden was struck with a spent ball and temporarily disabled, notwithstanding he cheered and pressed his men forward and held them in line under a galling fire after their ammunition was exhausted. At the battle of the Osage he dashed into the midst of a party of twelve rebels, killed 4 and took the other 8 prisoners. Lieutenant-Colonel Lazear was the directing spirit of his regiment and was ever under heavy fire. His horse was severely wounded under him and himself shot through the boot, but never faltered. Major Kelly's horse was shot under him, and though for a time he almost inhaled lead his lion heart never failed him. Majors Mullins and Neill, of the First, ever fought with distinguished heroism and made for themselves a name not soon to be forgotten. Captain Missemer, of the Fourth Cavalry Missouri State Militia, who commanded his regiment at the battle of the Osage, is commended for his bravery and judgment. Captain Blair, of the Fourth, who fell mortally wounded at the Big Blue, was as noble a soul and as true a soldier as eve lived. Vansickler, Hamilton, Dale, Bryson, Barkley, Christian, Combs, and Mullins sealed with their blood their devotion to pour banner and attest the unyielding courage exhibited by my command. I respectfully recommend Sergeant Sapp, Company C, Fourth Cavalry Missouri State Militia, Sergeant Truman, Company C, Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia, for promotion for gallant and meritorious conduct in action. To Captain J. H. Little, acting assistant adjutant-general, I tender my acknowledgement for their courtesy promptness, and admirable courage. Quartermaster Kenney and Commissary Bryan were faithful to their duty; and in behalf of the brigade I thank them for their provident care and activity. Especial praise is due Surgeons Trader and Shoot, Assistant Surgeons Edwards, Chastain, and Hart for their activity on the field and their kind and untiring effort in behalf of the wounded.

Since the 23rd day of September the soldiers of this brigade have been in the saddle almost day and night, without a change of clothing and much of the time on half rations, yet they were never heard to murmur. The stubborn courage, dash, and discipline exhibited by
