Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Winchester, Va.:

Will citizens of Maryland, serving it the rebel ranks, who may surrender under instructions of April 16, be allowed to return to their homes in the State of Maryland? I respectfully ask the same question in regard to West Virginia. The citizens of Wheeling, in mass meeting, have passed a resolution declaring that those from that place shall not return, and those that have already returned shall quit.

Brevet Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Winchester, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that, agreeable to instructions, I met Colonel John S. Mosby, S. C. Army, commanding Forty-third Virginia Battalion, to-day at Milwood, under a flag of truce, to confer with him touching the surrender of his command, and to conclude the details should he have decided to surrender upon the terms offered him. He declined to surrender at this time for the reason that his command was not in immediate danger, and that he had not such information as yet as would justify him in concuding the "Confederate cause" altogether hopeless. He expressed himself as anxious to avoid any useless effusion of blooed or derstruction of property and desirous therefore of a suspension of hostilities for a short time until he could learn the late of "Johnston's army." Should that be defeated or surrendered he said he should regard the "Confederate cause" as lost, and would disband his organization. He does not propose even in that event to surrender them as an organization for parole, but to disband the battalion, giving to each individual to choose his own course. He informed me he had already advised his command that those who chose to do so could come and give their parole. For himself he said he had no favors to ask, being quite willing to stand by his acts, all of which he believed to be justifiable, and in the course of my conversation with heim be remarked that he did not expect to remain in the country. I made agreement with him for a suspension of hostilieties for forty-eight hours longer, expiring at noon on the 20th, and a conditional agreement for a further suspension for ten days. These agreements are herewith inclosed, and I will inform Colonel Mosby of the action of the general commanding so soon as advised. I did not give him to hope that this agreement for a ten days' suspension would be councurred in. I regret that I have not the pleasure of communicating the surrender of this force, but trust any action in the premises will meet with approval. The interview throughout was characterized by good feeling.
