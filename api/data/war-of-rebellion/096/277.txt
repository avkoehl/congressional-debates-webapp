Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: The following communication has just been received be me from Captain Dunning, the officer commanding the upper end of picket line. I forward it by telegraph for your information:

YOUNG'S ISLAND FORD, MD., January 27, 1865.

MAJOR: I have just received information from P. S. Trundle, whose pass I inclose, that there are now in Leesburg about 300 rebels who intend attacking our lines. Their plan, he states, is to cross between the block-house and horse-pen culvert and attack the pickets simultaneously, also to cross another party between Lieutenant Day's post and Lieutenant Black's, and cross under the culvert at White's Ford. Their principal object is to capture horses. I find since I sent in my report this morning the ice in the river will bear at most any point. They are well acquainted with our number and strength and where each picket is posted. I have given instructions to be prepared at the upper end of the line.

I am, sir, respectfully,

E. C. DUNNING,

Captain, Commanding.

Colonel WILLIAM GAMBLE,

Commanding First Separate Brigade:

COLONEL: There are a number of steamers in the Potomac between Alexandria and Aquia Creek supposed to be fast in the ice. The major-general commanding directs that you send a battalion of cavalry to scout the country bordering the river to Aquia. The headquarters should be made at or near Dumfries. It is presumed that attempts may be made by guerrillas to destroy these vessels, taking advantage of the ice, and it is expected that you will prevent their success. The patrol should be preserved until the river opens.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
