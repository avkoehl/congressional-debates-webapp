Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I was at General Sheridan's tent at sunrise this a.m. He had learned nothing definite as to the movement of the enemy at that time. The army moved out about 9 this morning and are to-night encamped in the vicinity of Charlestown. The cavalry have been feeling of enemy. Firing was heard to-day, but I have not been able to learn anything from the front. Sent couriers to-night, who will return before morning. Can hear of no enemy up or down the river except from operator at Muddy Branch, which you have seen.
