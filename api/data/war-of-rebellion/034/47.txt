The firing was on my front, and done by a party of rebel cavalry against a foraging party from Second Division. I repaired to the place myself, and, on my return, reported by telegraph to general commanding, through his chief of staff.

FEBRUARY 15, 1863.-Skirmishes near Auburn, Tenn.

Report of Brigadier General David S. Stanley, U. S. Army,
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,Near Murfreesborough, February 16, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that the Second Michigan, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [F.] Fowler, returned at 2 p. m. He proceeded 3 miles beyond Auburn, charging and driving the rebels from a bridge they were destroying on the road leading to Liberty.

The enemy attacked him at 8 p. m. last evening. He repulsed them, killing 2 horses, and hearing the groans of their wounded, and exclamations that "I am killed!" Does not know their loss.

He has captured 4 prisoners belonging to the Tenth Kentucky. His loss is 1 man taken and 1 man wounded in the fleshy part of the thigh. In my opinion, Morgan's main force is not in that vicinity. If I am mistaken, by this time to-morrow I can collect force enough to attack and dislodge him.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. STANLEY,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
