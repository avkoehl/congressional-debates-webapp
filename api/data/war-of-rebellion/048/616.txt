attacking the force that had crossed at Kelly's Ford, and the army was withdrawn to the only tenable line between Culpeper Court-House and the Rappahannock, where it remained during the succeeding day. The position not being regarded as favorable, it returned the night following to the south side of the Rapidan.

The loss of General Rodes at Kelly's Ford was 5 killed, 59 wounded, and 295 missing. General Early's loss, including that of the artillery, was 6 killed, 39 wounded, and 1,629 missing. Some reported as missing were probably killed or wounded, and left in the hands of the enemy, and others failed to report to their commands.

Among the wounded were Colonel Cox, of the Second North Carolina, and Lieutenant-Colonel Sillers, of the Thirtieth - the latter, it is feared, mortally.

I forward herewith the reports of Generals Rodes and Early, the latter inclosing those of General Hays and Lieutenant-Colonel Tate, of Hoke's brigade.

A map of the locality is also annexed.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
