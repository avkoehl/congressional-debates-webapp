Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Hdqrs. Major-General Schofield:

General Hatch needs 60,000 rounds of Sharps carbine ammunition. I have sent a telegram to Major Beaumont for the ammunition, leaving the place blank. Please designate where it had better to be sent and notify me in return, that I may have a detachment there to get it. General Hatch also needs a supply of 3-inch Rodman ammunition for two guns; can it be got from General Cox? The dispatch ordering a brigade below town has been received. As soon as I learn what has become of Colonel Garrard's regiment I will designate a brigade to march early to-morrow morning. The captured prisoners have not yet reached my headquarters; I will send them forward as soon as they arrive. Please let me know whether the information obtained from them, a copy of which was sent to your headquarters is likely to change the orders already sent me. Lieutenant Tunica will wait for reply.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
