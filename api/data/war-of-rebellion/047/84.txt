The programme for to-morrow to commence the same as to-day; i.e., the New Ironsides to engage Wagner at sunrise, unless there are strong reasons to the contrary. Wagner will be assaulted to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 6, 1863-7.35 a.m.

General GILLMORE:

Do you want to the fire of all the monitors on Gregg and Wagner this morning? Do you propose to assault at low tide? Did you succeed last night?

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 6, 1863-8.30 a.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

We found the enemy prepared at Cumming's Point, and failed. I do not want the monitors' fire at all. I would like a slow fire from the Ironsides on Wagner. We are breaching the bomb-proof, and will not assault at this low tide.

GILLMORE,

General.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 6, 1863-1.35 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Our approaches have reached the ditch of Fort Wagner. Will you please have the Ironsides keep up a slow but steady fire on Wagner through the day? I will write you more fully in regard to the plans, or see you myself this afternoon.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 6, 1863-9 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

The mode of signals for stopping our fire at the moment of assault to-morrow morning about 9 o'clock is liable to uncertainty. I would suggest, therefore, that the moment the Ironsides begins very rapid fire, say at about half after 8 o'clock, she shall hoist a red flag, and when the half hour of rapid fire shall cease, this flag shall be hauled down, which will indicate the entire cessation of her fire. The fire of all the monitors is to cease when a red flag is hauled down on the mast, unless directed against re-enforcements coming u from Gregg to assist the enemy. The attention of commanding officers is particularly called to the delicate exertions required of them at this important moment.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.
