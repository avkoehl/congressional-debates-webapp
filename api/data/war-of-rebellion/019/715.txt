the War Department has instructed the Governor of Dakota in regard to raising troops. No more brigadier-general can be assigned to your department. The Secretary of War has given instructions to General [Lewis] Wallace in regard to paroled troops at Camp Chase.

General-in-Chief.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 7, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

General J. H. Lane, of Kansas, has raised three regiments. He has a commission for a brigadier-general from Indiana. Can I detail and give him a temporary command?* Blunt recommends it and favors it. He would help scare the rebels in Southwest Missouri and Arkansas very much.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 7, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

General Schofield telegraphs on the 6th that our advance pursued the enemy to Pineville, killing several. Our main force remains at Newtonia, a commanding position. Pineville is in the southwest corner of the State. Recent news from Greenville indicates a delay of McBride for want of shoes. General Davidson is informed that Captain Anderson's company of Enrolled Militia broke up a rebel camp near Little River, in Stoddard County, killing 2, and capturing all their blankets, quilts, and cooking utensils.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 7, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD, Newtonia:

GENERAL: Dispatches of the 5th and 6th received. The enemy could not exist near Elkhorn. He cannot live this side of Boston Mountains if you drive him out of Pineville, which you probably can do soon. One of my spies who have been in the enemy's lines since the 5th July has just arrived via Helena; from his report I infer they cannot have more than eighteen or twenty pieces of artillery against you. Hindman was in Little Rock on the 23rd ultimo. Do not be drawn down too far. The only supplies this side of the Arkansas are near Pineville or in the Indian Territory. If the enemy goes so far you had best make a detour into that county, returning to Springfield via Pineville, Neosho, and Mount Vernon before winter storms render the roads impassable. It may be necessary to keep an outpost in the region of Newtonia or Neosho. But we cannot keep a large army there during the winter. Try and get the militia enrolled.

Rosecrans has won a great victory at Corinth over Van Dorn, Price, and Lovell. The enemy left their dead and wounded on the field. Announce this to your command.
