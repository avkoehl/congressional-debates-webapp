. tives two hundred and thirty-fne, and to add at
the. end the words, 4i and L^ais;ana shall have
five hiiStead of four Repredcntativeo/'
The k-irneodment was not agreed to.
Mr. BRA DBITR.Y. ] now move to amend the
' bill by striking out all after the enacting oKmse,
and inserting1"' what 1 send to the Chair. ^ Th?
a'ricnd'Ocnt which X ojTer enihraces theprovisions
! '>f the bill as it now stands in sufh lanpoage us to
iciieve h from the obscurity which >*ome found in
!: it. I liave shown it to several individuals, and 1
believe it relieves the objections which they had to
the biil.
The substitute is as follows:
That the Secretary of the Interior proceed forthwith to
apportion the two hundred and thirty-three Kepre&entativcs
anions the seveial State!?, in .accordance with the provisions
contained in the twenty-fifth section of the act of 93d of
May, 1850, and according to the returns ol the population
winch have been completed and returned to the Oonsus Of-
fice, in The Department of the Interior; and it being matte'
to appear that the returns of the population of Cahfornia^re
impertcet or incomplete, it is turther enacted that said State
shall retain the number of Representatives prescribedby the
act of admission therool into the Union, until a Jiewappor-
tiohinoni; and for thupuipose the whole number of Repre-
sentatives is heieby im-rk-a^ed to two hundred and thirty-
four, until «uoh apportionment.
Sec. 2. J2nd be it further en acted) That if, at any future
decennial cnui.ierauon of the inhabitants of tho Unitert
t?t.itet«, tlie census oi any district or sub-iiivi^ion m the
United States hiiail have been improperly taken, or if the
returns of any district or sub division hhail be accidentally
io! t oi ib^rioyed, tiie Secretary of the Interior shall have
pmvei to order a new enumeration of such district or sub-
division.
Siic. 3 >.3nd be it further enacted, That the twentieth
&cction <."f the said act bo amended by strikingoutthe words
k> lia-. berii" fiom the las-t line, and inserting the woids " may
necessarily be55 in lieu thereof.
Mr. BA DGER. 1 believe that is very clear.
The PRESIDENT. The Chair, in looking to
the proceedings, fuids that the amendment offered
by the t^enatur from Louisiana waa an amend-
ment to an amendment offered by the Senator
from Maine. The question, therefore, comes up
on the amendment offered by the Senator from
Maine, which is to add an additional section.
Mr. BADGER. The Senator can withdraw it.
The PRESIDENT. The vote has been taken
on amending it.
Mr. BADGKR. True; but it has not been
amended, and until it is amended it is under the
control of the Senator.
Mr. BRADBURY. I suppose, as I now prc-
po:,e to strike out not only the entire amendment,
but also another section of the bill, it is in order.
The PRESIDENT. The Senator must be
awaie that another amendment, offered by him-
self, is pending-. But he can withdraw that, and
offer the present one.
Mr. BRADBURY. 1 will do so.
The PliESl DENT. It is proposed to amend
the bill !>y striking out all aftei the enacting clause
; ond insci isri'4 whii hap just been re.id.
j Mr. BOU LAND, i conciu in the propriety of
s tin1 p'OjH's-cd {intendment of tlie Senator from
i M une, with oni'exception. I think thai it would

i niitun<r Cal/.^rnia to rctcun her picsent representa-
| Lion in tne Mosise—U* f.uike the e'lactment with-
0i11 assi^niuj,- a reason,! thmk in puificient. If
! ;he re.'SMn he omnted, each Senator, in giving his
vote, wili he controlled by whatever reason may
ho present m hi--: ov. n mind. But in asai2:nin§ a
reason, it may icqoire Senators to vote for that
sviuJi they do not believe to be proper. 1 sug-
gest, thc-re'lore, to tho Senator to omit that por-
uon, and let the enactment be. that California
sha[\ ir-tfiin her presc-iit represc-ntation without as-
.sijrninu' any reason for it.
Mr. BRA OGURY, ! do not regard the reason
!j as very important. Itis for the Senate to determine
1 whether tl'rv v/iil v-Uui it or not. The hioguage
