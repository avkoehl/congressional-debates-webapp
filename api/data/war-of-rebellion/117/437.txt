in charge of Captain Richardson, volunteers; 333 on Monday to Sandusky in charge of Lieutenant Lupton, volunteers. I forwarded to Sandusky all prisoners that were on the miscellaneous roll. Many of them were prisoners of war, isolated cases that had been sent here at different times and some who had arrived with the guerrillas. I ascertained yesterday that some eight or ten guerrillas had succeeded in imposing upon me and being transferred to Cairo by answering to the names of dead men in some of the organized regiments. The rolls not being accurate it was an imposition easily practiced. I could not prepare the rolls to forward the guerrillas on sunday as directed. After all are forwarded as per roll there will a few remain who are not on the rolls. Shall they be forwarded to Sandusky? Please reply immediately. I forward the last detachment to Cairo to-morrow.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. FREEDLEY,

Captain, U. S. Army.
