Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary, Richmond:

A strong force of the enemy's cavalry and infantry advanced from Louisville, and encamped last night six miles from Waynesborough. They turned off this morning toward Savannah. Our cavalry is pressing on the rear, and all available means are being thrown to their front by rail. There is time yet for any assistance which can be spared to be sent by way of Charleston.
