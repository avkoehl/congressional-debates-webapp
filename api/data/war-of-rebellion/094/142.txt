Colonel, Commanding Post.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 10, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General DANA,

Memphis:

General Grant ordered all available troops in Missouri to re-enforce General Thomas at Nashville. All cavalry horses in the West were also ordered there, to remount General Thomas' cavalry. As soon as the crisis there has passed horses will be again sent down the Mississippi River. In the meantime you must do the best you can with the means at your disposal.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 10, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Major-General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

General Thomas has more cavalry now than he can mount, and requires all the horses to mount his own men. If you can send him infantry or artillery please do so. If the Cumberland River is closed they should go by Louisville. Whatever you can send can be returned as soon as the crisis is passed.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
