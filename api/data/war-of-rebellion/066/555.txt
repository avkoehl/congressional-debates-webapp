CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Adams' Run, S. C.:

General Taliaferro reports that the enemy has retired from his immediate front to the lower end of the island. Keep a sharp lookout to ascertain if they go toward you. Report exactly your position, what result so far, and what is now going on in your front. Colonel White has just received dispatch from you dated

yesterday, directing him to send a company of Thirty-second Georgia to John's Island. He thinks it was written to-day, erroneously dated, and has ordered the company accordingly. Do you wish that? Have you received any re-enforcements ordered to you?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Adams' Run, S. C.:

We can send you no re-enforcements from here. You will have to hold on till the troops arrive from Savannah.

By order:

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Adams' Run, S. C.:

Every man that can be moved as been ordered to you. Have not Company C, Bonaud's battalion, and the two companies Thirty-second Georgia yet arrived? First Georgia Regulars also ordered to you. Enemy assaulted Fort Johnson at daylight; were repulsed with heavy

loss; 140 prisoners, including colonel commanding, were taken, five barges also capture; our loss slight. They still retain their position in front of Secessionville.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Adams' Run, S. C.:

On what three roads did Jenkins report the enemy advancing, and in what force? They must not be permitted to get position on north end of John's Island. The re-enforcements from Savannah have reached you, and I suppose have been sent to Jenkins, who must give us as full information as possible of the movements and strength of enemy.
