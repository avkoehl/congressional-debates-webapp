HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 20, 1864-9.40 p. m.

General MEADE:

I shall not destroy the bridges, since I learn that General Warren is to move on the Telegraph road. When I sent my dispatch I was under the impression that my right flank would be entirely uncovered. I did not know of General Warren's movement.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 20, 1864.

General WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I will send the return of casualties as soon as possible. As to the corps moving in front, I gave specific and positive instructions this morning that General Birney should move his troops to their camps in rear of the woods. At daylight I found a brigade marching in front of the woods. I sent a staff officer at once to correct it, but, a fog intervening, it caused no difficulty to the last brigade that came in. I will have their camps struck and the troops marched back around to their present position in a way that cannot be seen. I have called upon General Birney for an explanation. Already 412 prisoners have been turned over to the provost-marshal-general.
