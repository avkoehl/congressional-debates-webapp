I have sent the Maryland Brigade to support Colonel Kitching, and called in Crawford's division to send to you. I think it is an effort of the cavalry to get on to the Fredericksburg road.

I am using every haste to get troops to help. I have reduced my front down to a single line of battle-that is my artillery firing. Can't you call on General Wright for help if more is wanted? I am sending a division to the fight, and as soon as I can a brigade to you.
