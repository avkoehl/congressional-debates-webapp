SUBSISTENCE DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, November 2, 1862.

His Excellency Gov. ZEBULON B. VANCE, Raleigh, N. C.:

SIR: It is every desirable to exhaust the hogs, beeves,pease, beans, and potatoes of that part of North Carolina which lies within the lines of the enemy or accessible to them. The President called my attention to information derived from you on the subject, and the representations made in response to inquiries have been of a discouraging nature. I venture to apply to you for action thereon. It is obvious that those charged with such an undertaking should be reliable business men, whose integrity and energy should be personally known to those among whom they are to operate. Neither myself nor any one in my office has such knowledge of the country or the people of lower North Carolina as to enable me to make the proper selections and the necessary arrangements to the above end. That being the case I write to ask if you will allow your agency to be used in this matter by having the whole devolve upon you, except so far as existing arrangements go. They run thus far: Mr. Jacob Parker has a contract for packing hogs at Warrenton, and has the following counties allotted to him for purchase, viz: Franklin, Warren, Nash, and Halifax.l In addition, Major W. H. Smith has made certain arrangements with Mr. H. Hayes, of Harrellsville, which he will detail to you. The balance of the district spoken of it is proposed to put under your charge, with these remarks:

1st. That as this Bureau has already more captains and majors than it ought to have it is not expedient to appoint more, except in case of absolute necessity, but to operate by agents, whose agencies can cease when their business with the Department closes.

2nd. That the points of delivery of the hogs should be fixed with reference
