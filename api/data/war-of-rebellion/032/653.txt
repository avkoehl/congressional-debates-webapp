Melville, stating that they were going to Stockton. It is possible that they intend going to Osceola or cross the Osage at Warsaw. I will follow up, and, if I can get within striking distance, they may swing on my right flank and endeavor to get out by the way of Lebanon. They are reported to be from 1,500 to 2,500 strong, with three pieces of artillery. They burned the court-house of Greenfield and gobbled up the horses, arms, and commissary stores of the company of Captain Morris, of the Seventh Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia, stationed at that post. I am expecting General Holland and Major Eno to come up with me to-day. Colonel Harrison, First Arkansas Cavalry Volunteers, was at Pineville yesterday, and is ordered to follow up as rapidly as possible.

HUMANSVILLE, MO., October 8, 1863-1 p. m.

I have just arrived here. My command has been increased by reenforcements to 1,200 men and three pieces of artillery. Shelby and Coffee passed through here at 5 p. m. last night. They burned the court-house at Stockton yesterday morning. Their present destination is undoubtedly Sedalia. They were at Quincy last night. I am pursuing them as rapidly as possible.

QUINCY, MO., October 9, 1863-9 p. m.

A dispatch just received from my scout at Warsaw states that the enemy, after going on the Sedalia road 7 miles, too the road to Versailles. As it will be impossible for him to go north, I shall act on the assumption that he will endeavor to get out by way of Linn Creek and Lebanon, and move my command, via Bolivar and Buffalo, toward Lebanon, leaving in the morning at 4 o'clock.

BUFFALO, MO., October 10, 1863-6 p. m.

I have just arrived here. A band of rebels, 45 in number, passed here last night, going south. They were doubtless of Shelby's command, and became detached before the command reached Warsaw. To-morrow I shall dispose of the force in this vicinity in such a manner as to render them most efficient to meet the divided and scattered bands of Shelby's command. I am inclined to believe they will pass east of Lebanon. I changed intended course by Bolivar, and came through by Hermitage. The country is full of guerrillas. To-day I threw out heavy scouting parties south of the Osage River. My messengers will wait at Lebanon for an answer.
