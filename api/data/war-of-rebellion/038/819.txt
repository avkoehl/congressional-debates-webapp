HDQRS. SECOND DISTRICT, DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Captain J. C. TAYLOR, Aide-de-Camp:

CAPTAIN: We are deficient in ammunition for caliber . 69; about two-THIRDS of the arms are of that character. The re-enforcements from here to General Bowen did not have to exceed 80 rounds per man. Constant engagements will soon exhaust that quantity. One hundred and seventy-two thousand mixed were received last night; that is only about 9 rounds per man for this district. I know it is difficult to procure it, but I wish we had 200 rounds per man, especially as our roads are now subject to interruption. A persevering and energetic officer sent therefor could add to our supplies from other departments.

Please ask the lieutenant-general to order my transportation back as soon as possible. No re-enforcements arriving by train. No stores can be forwarded without them. Nearly all of our supply train is there and en route. Reports of heavy artillery heard at Warrenton, in the direction of Grand Gulf; ceased about 12 o'clock.

I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,C. L. STEVENSON.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON:

The meat ration will be henceforward reduced to one-half pound of bacon and three-quarters of a pound of beef. Peas and rice must be issued in lieu of the diminution.

By order of Lieutenant-General Pemberton:

J. THOMPSON,

Assistant Inspector-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to direct you to leave at this point your chief quartermaster, commissary, and ordnance officer, as they are thoroughly acquainted with the arrangement of affairs in their respective departments. It is necessary that they should remain on duty here. The lieutenant-general directs that you have subsistence forwarded, and make arrangements to have beef and cattle drive toward Grand Gulf before you leave.

I am, general, &amp;c.,H. C. TUPPER,

Aide-de-Camp.
