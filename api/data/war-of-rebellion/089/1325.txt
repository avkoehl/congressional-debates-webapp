Reserves on Bald Head. She will come back and take twenty-five wounded men to Wilmington. Please order a steamer to come to Confederate Point, so that I may be enabled to throw troops on Bald Head. Steamer ought to come early.

SUGAR LOAF, December 27, 1864 - 4 p. m.

Major-General WHITING,

Fort Fisher:

Your dispatch dated 2 p. m. received. The steamer Cape Fear should be at the fort to-night, and another will be sent. The commanding general desires you will keep up constant communication with Bald Head, so that if the enemy attempt a landing the movable troops may be instantly thrown there. The enemy have all re-embarked.

General BRAGG,

Sugar Loaf:

GENERAL: The enemy are firing in the direction of Smithville, I suppose at the steamer Fry, now ashore near Campbell. It will be easier to send troops from Sugar Loaf than from this point if you have the steamer. I have no steamer here as yet which can come near enough to get troops rapidly on board in the night-time. Send a light-draught steamer as soon as possible. I will let you know what the firing is as soon as I can learn, but General Hebert can communicate with you by telegraph [more quickly] than I can.

General BRAGG,

Commanding, &amp; c.:

GENERAL: I will, if transportation is furnished, return General Hebert's people to him. The fleet appears to be moving further out to sea. Weather heavy. I do not think we will be interfered with to-night. It would be a good idea to have troops ready on transports off Sugar Loaf to be thrown to the other side should it be necessary, especially Bald Head.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
