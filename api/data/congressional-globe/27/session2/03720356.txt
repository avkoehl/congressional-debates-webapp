CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
This bilí was then brought forward, and he moved to suspend
tife rules for the purpose ot taking it up immediately for con-
««deration.   Did this look like acting like a "peculiar" enemy
oí the Administran in?   The motion faded.   They went into
Committee of the Whole, and he again moved to postpone the
appropriation bill, to take up this    On that question the Chair
decided against him    An appeal was taken from the decision of
the Chair; and he asked the gentleman from Virginia if he did
not vote aga nst taking up the bill at that time?
Mr. WISE said he would auswer the gentleman if he wished.
tCnea of, * Say yes or no," "Go on "3
Mr. FILLMORE said li the gentleman would say yes or no,
he would yield him the floor
Mr WISE, not directly responding, but offering to answer if
the gentleman would yield him the floor—
Mr. FILLMORE proceeded It was due to the majority of
this House tos iy, wha ever might have been the Yote of the
gentleman from Virginia, that they di I reverse the decís on of
the Chair, and they took up this bill, and went heartily into us
consideration
What was next? What took place on the 16 h instant? And
he appealed to those who sui rounded him hue, and to the
country, if he had not, at every opportunity, moved the cm=i
deration of thejotil And a majoiity ofthis House had mvana
bly sustained him, for the puipose o( sustaining the honor and
credit of the country and this Administration When they got
into committee, the first thing was the motion of hs friend
from Vermont [Mr Everett] to tack to this bill a tanfl bill
And what was the course of the ' pecutiai fuendsof the Ad
ministration en that motion, wmch must gieatly dQlay thn
bill, which it was necet>saiy to uige foiwaid to supply the
pressing wants of the Treasury, an J o aid the Administration,
whose organ on this fiooi denounced him (Mi F ) aa its ' prcu
]itr"enemy¿ He had opposed this as out of otder, although,
a proposition which his hicnd would have his suppott on
Mr. Wl&E    Ihegeu'leman is mistaken    So fai from my
Mr FILLMORE had said he (Mr. F ) had objected But he
asked what was the course of the gentleman fiom Virginia,
when this was likely to have the effect of detaining the loan bill
for three months to cornel Did lie oppose it? No, but, on the
contrary, he madea long speech in favor of that coming in for
coneideiation on thisbill, and at last it wis ruled out oí ordei
by a majority of Una committee
What next? Tne gentleman hidnotonlj attemplel to throw
the clog in the way of what he had called railrmd legislaron,
but that motion was noeoonu deposed of than he proposed an
other amendment to íepealthe hnd bill—a question which they
all knew could not be disposed of without long and tedious
útBCUssnn Aid they kuew ntoie, that if by possibility the
amendment (ou'd have been adopted in thisbill, it would have
defeated the manure
i*ow, he appeale I to the committee and the country to know
who had been tho ' peculiar" enemy of (his Admimsu uion m
opposing every pi iect tbu had li«n a^ked by it from this
House—whethei those wij claimed to be the 'peculiar,1'
friends ol tits AdminiotradOii, oi those whom they denominate
its "pecuiiai" enemies1
This was a history of the pioceedmgs ol this House, ho fu as
