APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May, 1838.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Mason.
H. of Reps 
The first was a loan through the medium of Treasury strip
The second, an issue of Treasury paper to the amount, and
in lieu of such <ib under the provjsions of the former law, had
returned into the Treasury and been cancelled
And the third, an issu- oí Treasury paper to the amount of
felOOOOOOO, hi Heu of the entile emission authorized by the
former law, and, as I understand it, to be reifouable and redeem
able at the discretion of the Secretary
Thut> infirm of purpose in their recommendafion, we should
have expected some lenity and indulgence to those who might
evince a disposition to select between the various modes of
raising this supply, as they emanated from the committee,
whethei by loan, as proposed in March, by a partial issue of
T reasury papei for immediate u=e, and a loan for the residue,
as proposed on the l/b of April, or by an emission for the
whole demand, in Heu of either, as recommended on the 23a
But no, the honorable chairman can biook no delay 1 rom
tne tenor of his remarks made^yeste  liy it, would s«em that
we are expected to carry th* last project of the committee at
once into law, without even looking baek, or considering m any
f>rm what hi- own committee recommended so very shortly
before                                           -
Of these noxious projets, sir, I prefer that of the 13th of
Afjnl, providing an issue of Treasury paper to meet immediate
want, and aloan for the íesidue and I wou *d take it as proposed
from fhe Committee of W\i>3 and Means, with this single dif
ference in the the terms of loan that, inste id of selling Trea«*u
ry six per cent si rip at twelve, eighteen and twenty fom
m >nth=,, I wou'd extend the time of payment and reduce the
rate of interest
As the fir^t íeason for this preference I have but to quote
from the iepoit of the honorable chanmtn which accompa
r-ed the bill—an authority for which £ ask his respect He re
commends the loan in preference to notes receivable for public
dues, because the latter have been found,- under the experience
of the 1 He law, to reduce, instead of augmenting the revenue
Let me be understood, if yoi please, as,adopting the objection,
thou h not as the chairman hits conceived it I am at some
loss to know how acredit of $10000003, fully realized as so
much money, can reduce the revenue But I can well under
stand, if the line of credit be too s lort how a revenue, re
ducedby :>tner crudes, may ba unable to meet cutreatdemand ,
and at tne sime time to absJtb the i=sue undent And this is
the ti p th of the objection to any similar issue, a* it is taken
m the repoit of the csmmittee—an objection (hat was ably
taken, and well relied en, however misconceived in its apph
cation
Wha was the condition of our revenue then? A sudden and
violent revuision had just occurred m every branch of trade
aid business, putting a complete stoppage upon the whole
T iere weie no customs because importation h id ceased, and of
th pubh lands the sales were at an end Bei scut off from
the s^pp íes ol trade, our merchants could not pay the reve
nua bond* % ven before the catastrophe And of tns public
mwiiey on Jeposue all had bee \ used which, from its locality,
could be made available, The banks too had suspended pay
mpiit throughout the country, and all sources of revenue wure
c Jt oft alike Jrom th * Government and from its debtors
In this btate of things Congress, at ihe special session, order,
el uiursueof Treasury notes, redeemable in twelve months,
aid in the me^a time receivable in payment of public dues
I then preferred the bill tn that form, una, under the cir
cumstancei  then exiting, shouldcertainly have that preference
atill
fcirot, because it was the only meant, by which the Govern
meat could make its credit "vuUbl Aloan could not have
been negotiited oniny tenr<3 certain!y not at horn1 for thei
was no many disposable m mark t save the disgraced cunency
of the banks, nor abroad, b-ut ise of the prohibitory rate of
exchange
And secondly, because thn dissiaeed cm rency, not bemg re
cuvabic by G wcrn nent n was paialy/ed alike in recuvin*
oi paymgita dsbrs, and Ire is try notes receivable Jurnished
a medium for both
By this leceivabihty Government was obligated to retire
ik see/ilences of debt as fist as thev weae presented before
the en re exedn expired and it íue íesulted m practice that
the> flowed back upon th  Treasury faster than the accruing
revenue could absorb thei i
Knowing well mat the revenue was yet m far too enfe°bled a
condition to meet the Government exp ndnure, and provide tor
this debt as it flowed in, the committee, in their repoit,
have eainestly rem uistra ed against a 'ike provision in the
nrw lRsne
That such is, n tac , ius condition I have only to refer to *he
letter of the foecetary of the Treasury iccompanym^ the Ih\,
ai Ipq 's menage to tin House on th„ 10th dtiy ot tni* month m
which he sajs Out luung the piesenf vear th revenue his
be*1!! paid in Ttea&aiv notes to suca m extent, that only tbout
oí ° fourth o/ í million has been receiveu. from it in money so
as to assist in dHjHrgmg th-cuireit expenditures " Ihtse

a month, the cash receipt does not exceed one quarter of a
million and yet, with theorv and pracuce both un ted agn nst if
we are lequ red now to re ei act the veiy same Uw
Bat, sir without the l^ht of such expcneriee, I should be
against this node of raising monej, eicept unüer circumstances
of such imperious necesbity as left to other alternative
I carnot consider tins a^ a party queatio t although b\ io
ir^nnsoie of those who proteo % freedom from ail party re
ticim yet >no^ %«nons where such restiai it would overrule
my own «en eofrign I cannot and will no icgardit 1 concur
lully m the necessity ot raising this supply I am prepared to
 ?lt ,1 ^fheerfuny, and without stmt, and wuhojt any rebnU
upon the Adnjinwtration, for I do not believe that it tsjust
responsible I trace its diminished revenue to cau«es over
which it has, and ought to hav , no control, to those causes
which have operated to impair the revenue of ait alike, whose
resources are implicated m the trade and business of the
country
until that trade and business shall revive, and be agrain
in a condition to make its wonte 1 returns to the public coffers,
money must be raised upon the pub c credit in some form
To this all are agreed, and our plain path of duty is, to ootam
it on the most economical terms withm the pale of our authority
Looking to the former practice of the Government, I am
taught to believe thit an issue of Treasury notes ha^ b en
looked upon rather as the alternate e of an unembarrassed turan
ctei than the choice of undoubted credit
Inthefirsfftar loan of 1821, Mi Gallatin thenat'he lieadof
the Tressury, ( whose ability and knowledge of this subject none
will quest on ) reported to Congress that, of the eleven millions
inth irize 1 to be raided >y loan; but little more than six millions
had b sn taken, Iea\ mg a deficit of (¡early frv e millions ef do!
'ars    Speaking of this deficiency, he says
"It ia conn icntly believed th t the amount which remains uu
subscribed (or wilt thus be filled as early as the money may be
wanted for the public service In order however, to pre cent
th" possibility of disappoijitment, and to remove doubts and
eironeous expe< tations, I beg leave to submit the propriety of
authorizing the usueof Treasury notes on the following prmci
plC, V17
"1st Not to exceed in the whole the amount which may u u
mately not be subscribed to the loan that k to say, that the
amount rece.ve 1 on aceount of the lojn and that of the Treasu
ry notes shall not together exceed $U Ü0O 00
"21 To hear an interest," &c —GaUaunts Report on the
Finances, May 14 1312
Here, then, we have proofs that the first i gue of Government
paper, since the old continental money, t.the history of which
we all know ) was not recommended or retorted to un'il a 'oan
had failed, and then only and stnetly as auxiliary to aloan di
íect So fat trom bema treated as an ordinary resource, Mr
Gallatin aske 1 the pow er, m his own emphatic language, on!)
' to prevent the possibility of disappointment" ifthe loan should
fail It w is cons dered by him as the very ' medicine of state,'
to be administered only m the last resort, and when othervusp
th*1 patient must expire Under such auspices, we had our
first issue of Treasury notes, amidst the embarrassments of a
war, and under the pi essure of impaired credit The necessities
and d ficulues of the times forced this measure into use upon a
bkil ful though teiuctant financier His sagacity doubtless fore
saw tho consequences, though from them there was no escape
The emission was continued from time to time, at increased in
terest, until they were depreciated at the doors of the Treasury
as low as seventy five for the hundied
Mr Dallas, who came after Mr Gallatin into tho Treasury,
was opposed to thecoi unuanon of this policy But Mr Eppe*,
then chairman of the Ways and Means m ah  'House, espoused
the opposite His purpose wastocreate and continue a Govern
mem paper to supply a circulating medium for tne country to
take the place of the paper of the state banks, then di credited
by rhe suspension of specie payments
"The wantofsome medium ' sajs Mi Lppes,' which, rest
mg on a firm and solid basis, may unite public confidence, ard
have a general instead of a local circulation, is now universal!)
acknowledged,' and after lecommendmg a further issue of
Ti easury notes fe r this purpose, he continue 
' í o receive their circulation   it would be necessary,
"1st   To is^ue them m small sums
'2d To allow holders to fund them at pleasure tn Sper

3d  1o make them pavabie to bearer and pas* by deliver)
Hi  Ti make them receivable in all puolu, dues

¡such was Mr Eppes's idea of the (rue uses aid intent of a
Treasury is ue Bu* r% en he was obliged to rest it for support
on the funding system Regardiig ¿permanent debt as the
lot of ourcounuy m common with all others, he looked to
that as the legitimate and orly -upport of his scheme of Gi.
vernment paper money, to be funded at the pteasurtofth
holder, or at the mV of Government, in pe\mancnf 8 / cr
cent stock
Mr Pallas however, m alet'ertoMr Eppe", soon after th¡=>
report appealed condemned this scheme in the  longest 'Ctnm
He considered with Mr G iilatin that Tre^un* paper the u i

m ciia, H rcqupeil, on far cheaper Ierm^í
Let us estimate the difieience in cofct. By the late law
twentv thousand dollars was appropriated from the Treasury*
to defiaf niec<v*t of the emission, including the salaries of four
extra clerks', at &12D0 per annum each, to keep the account*
These clerks and these salaries at least must be continued so
long as the system is kept up
Then the rate of interest must be at the least 6* percent, itnd
when we allow for depreciation, win. h to my apprehension is
inevitable, the loss tothe Treasury will fall in propotuo,n
On what tei ms, then, could a loan be obtained? I ffretehct io
no certain knowledge on this head, but, from the best smiTces
o'mfoimation to which I can refer, Government stock having
irom three <o five years to mn would bring par m the market,
and yield com, or its equivalent, at an mteiest of from 4| to 5
per cent
But we are told by the honorable chairman that a loan would
be unjustifiable," I quote his#wn word, because the Govern-
ment will have the money from its own resources for the year,
before the loan could be made available And for these re-
source^ In. refers lo the instalment from the deposite banks in
d e South and West, to fall due m .July, the merchants* bo lis
for revenue, on which time has been allowed, and the honda of
the Bankof the United States, al! which he estimates at 3orae
seven millions of dollars
Now, fcir, *n rep'y to all this, I quote bark upon him an an
thority which he, at least, cannot venture to contradict     I
quJ-e h sortTtxeport upon the state of the finances, made to us
on the 5th of March last, when, after a dispassionate and ex
tended view of the whole eround, he says
"It m obvious that, far from toeing a surplus, there will be a
deficiency, which must be supplied, either by a rei°sue of the
Treasury notes redeemed, or by an authority to issue others.
There ib,not the lea^t probability that our revenue /or two
years to com" w il be equal lo the wants of GovernmenjE, and
i f for the next four years it should be sufficient to meet otir ex-
penduures, and to redeem the Treasury notes which have
been or may be hereafter issued, u will be full as much, as
can be reasonably anticipated "
Itid, again, m the same report, speaking of the probable
time for redemption of this paper, he says
" The Treasury notes required for the service of 18& and
1839 will only be issued to discharge claims as the money may
be wanted, aííd any surplus which may accrue in 1840 and
1841 willbf immediately applied to their redemption *'
What brotd admissions have we here, sustained, too, as they
are made, by facts and teaeoning in the report, m opposition to
confident declarations thrown out in the debate1 ¿et the ho.
norable chairman reconcile them if he can. What, then, are
the facts! Why^that for two years, at least, yet to come, «ere
the Treasury free trom debt, the revenue would i o£ be ''equal
to the wants of Government" And with this burden of ten
millions of defet in Treasury sotes, to he redeemed, U Will, an
derthemo«t favorable circumstance*, require ibur years, at
least, t#> eííbCt h¿ and meet ordinary demand  at the same time
The years i$t0 and 1841 are presented as the earliest period at
which any surplus can be spared, to tegm the final re Jemption
of the Treasury notes
But sir without this authority from the committee, we have
en lugh m the report of the Secretary himse f, communicated to
this House bat two days ago, to satisfy us that the Treasury is
in no condition, from resources ordinary or extraordinary, to
t rovide for this debt at any time earlier than that indicated in the
report
He tells us that, on the day his letter is dated, the whole
'  money in the Treasury available for use but little exceeded
J  gdOU OUO, and ai the ten millions of paper authorized to fae is*
!  sued m Octou^r la t the whole had been used   except about
$200 000, making for available means on hand, not sit bun
I  dred thousand dollars, with nearly four millions and a half of
ijeasjry paper yet unredeemed
, That, during the present year, the revenue had been paid in
Treasury note-to such an e^tert tha' only about one fourth
i of a million m nthly had been received from it m money, so as
¡ toas istmdi rhdiemg the current expend rurey while they
Cthp evpent i'uies) had on an average, for the curren . >ear,
