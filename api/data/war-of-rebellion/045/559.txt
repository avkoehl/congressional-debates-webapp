HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Gettysburg, July 6, 1863-9. 50 a. m.

General COUCH:

I cannot get very reliable intelligence of the enemy's movements. My belief is they are in retreat for the Potomac. A captured dispatch to a rebel cavalry officer, dated July 5, says Longstreet is moving through Jack's Mountain, and orders him to picket roads to Emmitsburg, and to report to Longstreet, at Jack's Mountain, and Ewell, at Fairfield. Sedgwick, with his corps, is pushing them at Fairfield; other corps are in support.

I have delayed my flank movement until I am positively satisfied they are retreating to the Potomac. I hope some time to-day to determine this.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: A brigade of cavalry, under Colonel McIntosh, is ordered to communicate with you from Emmitsburg, and also to send forward toward Waynesborough to feel for the enemy.

Very respectfully,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 6, * 1863-11 a. m.

Major-General FRENCH,Commanding at Frederick City:

Major-General Meade desires me to say, in consequence of a large body of the enemy being concentrated on the road toward Hagerstown, beyond Fairfield, he has suspended his operations for the present. Indications go to show that he intends evacuating the Cumberland Valley, but it is not yet positively ascertained. Until so ascertained, the general does not feel justified in leaving here an moving down toward you.

[The enemy is very much crippled. The general is under no apprehension of their attacking you, provided your cavalry keep a good lookout, and are kept well out to your front and flanks. +]

Very respectfully, &c.,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General.
