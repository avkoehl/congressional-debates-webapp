out militia. In Alabama little has been done. A good re-enforcement of State troops for guard of eastern lines of communication with Mible will enable me to act more efficiently for defense of Mobile and Ohio Railroad.

Major-General GARDNER,

Jackson, Miss.:

I will go to Meridian to-morrow. clanton left Montgomery this evening for Selma and Meridian. Berry's and Crew's battalions left here this morning for Corinth. You had better stop them at Meridian, if you will need them. Concentrate all you can in time to defend the Mobile and Ohio road.

Major-General, Commanding.

MOBILE, December 3, 1864.

General F. GARDNER,

Jackson, Miss.:

Abbay's battery has seventy men more than are necessary to work his guns; armies with rifles, they will be very useful. Inform General Kirby Smith of all important movements, as Davidsons' and Steele's, asking him to help you by sending troops over or by creating diversion. General Beauregard is in Montgomery, but going eastward again at once. When will you and Governor Clark be in Meridian? Twelve field guns left here this morning, with party in charge, destined for Corinth. How are militia turning out? Mobile and Ohio Railroad between Enterprise and Bucatunna should be well guarded, also telegraph line. Have you good officer and militia, or other force, to place there?

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.
