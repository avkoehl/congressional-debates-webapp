CITY POINT, VA., March 30, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

Have no definite information of the affair on front of the Ninth corps last night. The enemy opened upon us, and scared a portion of our picket-line. This was recovered, and the firing of artillery and musketry became general. Our loss is reported at 9 killed and about 40 wounded. Enemy's loss unknown. Both sides appear to have been somewhat stampeded.
