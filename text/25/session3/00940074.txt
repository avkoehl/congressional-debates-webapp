THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 28,
anthmetic,and his countryman [Mr Atherton]
íaised himself in my estimation by his gallant
ai d patuotic defense iNow, when a well sup-
poited chaige is biougbt, the simple answer is,
" theie is no coiruption "
I want to call the attention of the House to an
other fact When the gentleman from Vnginia
had finished, a Representative from New Hamp-
shne rose in haste, and, I thought, to make some
defense for the Secretary of the Fieasuty, when,
lo and behold' ho actually asked leave to ofTei a
íesolution that the Speaker appoint a Committee
on Enrolled Bills ' t hope yet to hear that gen-
tleman [Mi Cushman] iU fend the Secretary with
his accustomed ability I hope, for the sake of
the country, to hear some explanation ofHaius's
case, oí Linn's case, and of Boyd's case I hope
to he u some excuse to justify the Secretary in
allowing Swartwout to be a defaultei for six or
seven years, and keeping it concealed, 01 some
excuse for not discoveiing the defalcation But,
su, when I return home, I will take this document
in my hand, and will tell the honest men whom 1
repiesent that the defenders of this Administra
tion say that theie was no coi i uption in this Sec
letaiy's allowing, knowingly, paitisan office-
holder thus to use the public funds
Mi WILLIAMS, of Kentucky, said it had
been insinuated, if not directly chai gcd, by thi
gentleman from New Hampshire, [Mi Atiilu
ton,] that documents whieh had been ordeicd to
be punted at this session weie not comtat ible
In leply, he made an explanation, showing that
the delay in furnishing the extia topics of the
documents iccompanying the Pusident's mess lge
was occasioned by the want oí one of the maps
which was to accompany these documents, and
which was not yet completed by the engravei
Mi f HOMPbON said that one of the icmaiks
of the gentleman fiom Mai y land sounded some-
what stiangely in his eai It was this that the
present Administration was not ícsponsible , be
cause the cas s contained m the itpoit oceuned
during the past Administration
Mi THOMAS said that any attempt to hold
tins Administration responsible foi the deialca
tions stated m document No 111 must h futile,
since defalcations had happi ncd under all Admm
istiations
Mi  THOMPSON   Will, sn, what is the po
sition now taki n by the gentleman 5   Why, that,
because defalcations h ive taken place und< i  all
Admnustiations, and in the natuie of things will
take place, then foie the Admiiiistiation is not to
be hi Id lcspcnsibli foi  continuing in oflioe  and
reappointing len nil defaulters   nun who, with
out excuse 01 palliation, h id ( nibiz/lcd th(  | lib
lie mom y     Defalcations may have  t iki n place
until i  all Adnumstiations   but wen   the dihn
qui nts leappomtcd to oílii e aft< i a knowlidge of
then frauds; 1 hat is, thegi ivamen of the chargi
It is in this that we say that peculation was not
only tolerated but encouiaged   Inoncofthi casts
thefmbesr/lemtnt was not denied, but was admit
ted, and a bond give n for the amount, and the olh
cer leappomted   it shows, su,as w is said by the
gentleman fiom Mississippi, that then molality
is the Spartan, by which the oik ns< does not con
sist in doing theac t, but in doing it so bunglin^ly
as to be dis oveied, thatvnlue whu hShakspe ue
ascribes to tin  Vi netian ladit s—not to li tve un
done, but to kei p unknown     It is saying, in no
unequivocal language, embe/zlt, use, and spec-
ulate on the public money as much as you choose,
piovidedyou keep it concealed     But it is said
that these things took pi ice undei   tin   late Ad
ministration  that it is not the foxth it has bioken
into the roost, but the ¡ion   Ay, yes   sn , we are
now beyond the reach of that lion's paw
But, sn.all these robberies of the Treasury
sink into utter insignificance m comparison with
the stupendous proposal to legalize such a sys-
tem, and make it peipetual    This, we are told, is
to be a constitutional lieasuiy   Yes, sn , every-
thing is baptize d " constitutional" in these days
I think I saw the other day, m some paper pub
hshed " down east," an advertisement of " con-
stitutional pens," and with pist as much reason
What is the gentleman's aigument for this inde-
pendent Tieasury>  Why, sir, it is that we can-
not well avoid having agents to receive the public I
money, ftithless as they now have been proven
to be, and what would common sense draw asan
wfeience iiom that; Why merely that, if we must
have them, and as they are liable to temptation,
we ought to tiust them as little as possible But
what is the gentleman's inference ' It is that, as
they cannot be trusted with small sums, he is for
tiustmg them with all the íevenue The gentle
man seems to reverse the scriptural principle of
lecompenso " because thou hast been faithful in
a few things, I will make thee lord over many
things " but his principle seems to be, "because
thou hast been faithless in a few things, I will
make thee íuler ovei many " We have had two
classes of agents—banks and individuals The
first have been faithful beyond anticipation, the
latter faithless to a geneial and alarming extent
We have lost by banks as depositoues less than
a million, fiom the foundation of the Government,
whilst we have lost by one single sub Treasurer
a million and a quaitei
Mr CAMBRhLEiNG We have lost forty
millions by banks
Mi THOMPSON No, sn I know better I
know that such a statement his been in public
documents, and one emanating fiom that gentle-
man, hut it is a fraud to say so—afiaud m argu-
ment, I mean I will give the gentleman the pie-
cisi amount lost by the banks as depositories—
*4759,()0O In the leports alluded to, this sum is
swt lied by chaiging upon the banks the loss from
the use of then cjcpitciated papel Let us exam
me this slnllow deception It was dining the wai
that this de j icci Utcl jiapeí was used what else
could be doiii ? Hiere was not ten millions of
spiiiein the e ountiy, and annual appiopnations
ot filty millions Specie was clearly out of the
question Tieasuiy notes wire the only alterna-
tive, and they wcil tued, and the íesult was, that
the y were at a discount much below bank notes,
and this, in the limited amounts issued, fiom the
fact that bink notes weie used, butif banknotes
had been i ejected, and Treasuiv notes issued,
the y would have fallen to the woithlessness of
Continental mon y As it was, they woie greatly
be low paper money \ es,su , we have lost nearly
twice as mu h by one sub l'teaseiier as we have
lost in all fiom banks fiom the foundation of the
Gove rnment What does thisconipanson show >
It shows, as clcai as the light, the supei lor safety
of hanks No man heie willdaie use in his place,
and attempt to pio\e that ind btedness fiom cor-
porations is not anion safe condition than indebt
edncss A mi individuals We have tried both, we
la\c fmiidtheon class dishonest, tempted even
by ¡mull sums to defiaud the public, ind led on
to pec ulate at 1 ist to the amount of millions And
whii is the lemedy? Why, sir, to make them
the (lc|>ositon< s of our entire íevenue That is
the logic Were these logicians acting in then
own puvate allms, I am apt to think they would
ill aw soundei conclusions
fake this case of Swaitwout In carrying the
public funds fiom the custom house to the bank,
lie c mbi 7/led mote than a million the panacea is,
to i,ive lum millions on millions to keep perma-
nently Sm ill sums are not safe whilst meiely %n
Iraniiln from the custom house to the bank, but
wi ai e urged to tiust millions to them permanently,
and why > Because of the additional cobweb se-
cunties of this hill Itis.m my judgment, a most
unsafe mode of keeping the public money, and
fearfully demoiahzmg in its tendency If adopted,
as expunging is the oidei of the day, it would be
well to expunge fiom the Lord's prayer that ad-
mirable passage, " Lead us not into temptation "
Mr T said he took no pleasure in thus eaily
being forced into a discussion of this question
But the g ntlemanfiom Maryland hadmtioduced
it, and he could not peimit his remarks to pass
unansweicd Mi T was aware of the many
considerations that demanded that he should meas-
uie his language upon this subject The State
which he in pait lepresented held diffeient opin-
ions from himself, and he did not hesitate now
to s ty, when improper motives can scarcely be
attiibuted to him, and there is no community upon
earth for whose enlightened patnotism he had so
piofound a íespect This is no new opinion, it
had giown with his growth, and strengthened
with Ins stiength, it was rnoie than an opinion,it
was a sentiment, a passion, and he would add, in
all smceuty, that never was the State (he spoke
of the State, not of individuals) actuated by a
rnoie sincere conviction, or a more interested pa
tuotism, in any of those peí íods which have here-
tofore so glonously marked her high career   If he
had any doubts on the question, he waakl long
since have sunendered his opinions to those of
the State But believing, ard, indeed, knowing,
as he did, he never could suppoit, and nevei
shoi Id cease to oppose, with ail his poorpowers,
so disas'ious a measuie He gieatly doubted
whether the people of this countiyevei would
piactically elect another Piesident, whethei we
have not taken the step fatal ti all othei Repub-
lics, of the Piesident nominating his successor
Adopt this system, and he saw little hope of íe-
sistance to any future Administiation
Mi JOHNSON, of Maryland, made turther
explanations in relation to the delays in the de-
livery of certain documents oideied tobe printed
in consequence of a map not being completed
He then went on to admit that the revenue
must be collected by agents, and that these agents
would always be moreoi less liable to coriuption
He maintained, however, that the sub Tieasury
scheme would be no remedy for the evil Ypt he
thought a i emedy was practicable, and if no other
membei did, he now gave notice that, when the
sub Treasury bill came up, he should move an
amendment providing for the adoption of the plan
now in use in Vnginia in regard to the collection
of the revenue The collectors never touched a
dollai of the money collected, the meichant de-
posited the amount of his duties in bank, and
gave a bank certificate to the collector, the money
was diawn out, not by the collector, but by the
Tressurei of the United States This plan would
go fai to obviate the difficulty, and render such
cases as that of Swartwout impossible Mi J
was opposed to the whole plan of securities, and
this mode of collection would render them unne-
cessary It would concentrate responsibility, and
fix the public eye on a single man He com-
plimented the eloquence of his colleague, [Mr
Thomas,] agreed with him that corruption evei
had and evei would exist under all Governments,
but objected to the sub Treasury scheme as going
to i adíate and disseminate that coriuption in all
dncctions through the countty If the teceiver
could be placed in some safe where he could be
loe ked up, then Mi J would tiust him with the
person il custody of a million and a half of dol-
lars, as m Swaitwout's case, but not otherwise
Mi THOMAS lose to say a few words to the
gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wise,] and make
a brief íeply to one part of the remaiks of the
gentleman fiom South Carolina, [Mr Thomp-
son ]
The gc ntleman from Virginia had taken an
extiaordinary advantage of an admission made m
a private conversation He had said to the gen-
tleman fiom Vnginia that he (Mr T ) had not
read the whole of document No 297 Possessed
of this fact, in this way, the gentleman fiom Vir
gima had put the question, in the couise of his
speech, " has the gentleman read the document
proposed to be printed ?" He knew what answer
would be given, for he had previously been pri-
vately told that the whole of the document had
not been perused This circumstance the gentle-
man has commented on foi effect, and charges
me with ignorance of material facts Such a pro-
ceeding cannot but be consideied as very unfair
When the gentleman reflects, he will feel that he
has done himself and me gross injustice I can,
without difficulty, lay a foundation for returning
this language to the gentleman Has he read the
report of the Secretary of War, with its accom-
panying documents' Has he read a report from
the same source, lecommendmg a system of de-
fense for the northern frontier, with its tabular
statements, throughout? Has the gentleman read
one fourth of the voluminous document 1 hold in
my hand ' We know he has not Then he is
ignorant of all these important papers, and has
voted, notwithstanding hit, ignorance, for or
against this publication In so doing, he has acted
as ninety-nine hundredths of the House have done
It is not to be presumed that any one of us reads
all the documents published to enable us to vote
for or against their publication Befoie we act
finally upon the subjects to which they relate, we
read all or such parts of them as aie required, to
be piepared to vote understanding^ This is
what I have done, and shall do m the present
case And I repeat, the gentleman has acted very
unfairly m attempting to pioduce an impiession
anywhere that the statement made by me to him
in  the first instance, m a private conversation,
