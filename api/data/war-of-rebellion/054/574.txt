COLONEL: I received your dispatch at 2 a. m. My scouts had a skirmish with the rebels yesterday within 2 miles of their camp, capturing 4 and killing 2. I have had 2 men slightly wounded. I also destroyed their salt-works, which were very extensive. Within 4 miles of this place there are six fine merchant mills, and within 10 miles there are fourteen. The rebels are threatening to burn them, but I can easily prevent it. The road is in very fine condition.
