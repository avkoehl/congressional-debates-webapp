Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Railroad track finished and cars in. Columns are well across Oostenaula, and I will aim to reach Kingston to-morrow, and the Etowah on the third day. I take it for granted Rome will fall as a consequence.

(Received 8.30 p.m 17th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

We are in possession of Resaca. It is a strongly fortified position, besides being a strong natural position. We saved the common road bridge but the railroad bridge is burned. The railroad is good to this point, and our cars will run here to-day. Our columns are now crossing the Oostenaula; General McPherson at Lay's Ferry, General Thomas here, and General Schofield about Newtown. We will pursue smartly to the Etowah. Generals Stoneman's and Garrard's cavalry are trying to get in rear of the enemy, and I hope will succeed. Our difficulties will increase beyond the Etowah, but if Johnston will not fight us behind such works as we find here, I will fight him on any open ground he may stand at. All well and in high spirits. We have about 1,000 prisoners and 8 guns.

I do not want the services of William Wallace. We are making good progress, though too slow to keep up with my wishes. To-morrow we move toward Kingston. Telegraph Colonel Hoffman where the wants prisoners of war sent to, and as they reach Nashville so order it.
