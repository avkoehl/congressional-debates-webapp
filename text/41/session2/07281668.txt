l'he amendments reported from the eommit-
teo were tosuhstitute in the first section the name
of''John S. Hardenburgh" for "David Dows,"
and " N. B. Curtis, of Illinois," for " .John J.
Mitchell, of Missouri;" also to strike out the
words " in the nameand on behalf of tbe United
States," near the commencement of the second
section. The question was upon agreeingto the
amendments reported from the committee.
Mr. PETERS. Will the gentleman from Illi-
nois [Mr. Ingersolt,] yield to me to offer an
amendment?
Mr. INGERSOLL. 1 dislike to yield for any
amendment. I prefer that the House shall act
upon tbe bill as it comes from the committee.
Mr. COX. Does the gentleman propose to
put this bill on its passage without discussion ?
Mr. INGERSOLL. How much time have I
remaining ?
The SPEAKER. There are twenty-two min-
utes of the morning hour remaining.
Mr. KERR. Will the gentleman yield to me
for an inquiry ?
Mr. IN GERSOLL. I prefer not.
Mr. WOOD. I desire to ask a question.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Very well; what is it?
Mr. WOOD. Does the gentleman propose
to move the previous question now upon a bill
which has just taken half an hour for its read-
ing without any discussion whatever ?
Mr. INGERSOLL. I suppose if this bill is
not acted upon finally this morning it will go
over and continue to be the business of the
morning hour until disposed of.
The SPEAKER. That will be its course if
it goes beyond the morning hour of to-day,
and it will come up again during the morning
hour of Tuesday next.
Mr. KERR. Is it the intention of the chair-
man of the Committee on Railways and Canals
[Mr. Ingersoll] to press this bill to a vote in
the absence of the minority of the committee
reporting this bill? The gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Winchester] is not at present in
health, and is notable to be here to-day, either
to make a minority report or to be heard upon
the floor of the House. This bill is too import-
ant to be rushed through to a vote without
opportunity for a hearing. A full consideration
of this measure is due not only to the minority
of the committee, but to the House itself. I
ask, therefore, that aetion on this bill shall be
deferred.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I was not aware until
this moment that the gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr. Winchester] is absent to-day, nor was
1 aware of his illness.
Mr. CONGER. I trust the gentleman from
Illinois will give me an opportunity to move
to substitute the name of Edgar White for
that of Halmer H. Emmons as commissioner
for the State of Michigan, the latter gentle-
man having been appointed and confirmed as
a judge of the circuit court of tbe United
States.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Perhaps I will yield at
another time, before final action on the billj
but I cannot do so now.
Mr. COX. I would like to ask the gentle-
man from Illinois upon what principle the men
who are named in the bill to act as trustees
or directors have been selected? Upon what
peculiar principle has the committee selected
the men to run this road ?
Mr. INGERSOLL. On the principle upon
which any important business interest would
â– elect men of capacity and integrity to dis-
charge a public trust.
Mr. COX. Are they all from New York,
or from different places along the line of tbe
road, or from everywhere in the United States?
Mr. INGERSOLL. They are not confined
to any particular locality, as the gentleman
will see by reference to the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to a rea-
sonable amount of debate on this bill; but the
House is aware that substantially the same
measure was considered here during the last
Congress, that it was debated, and was passed
by a large majority. Most of the members of
the House are well aware, from personal
observation, of the condition of the railroad
interests between here and New York city.
Hence upon that point there is no need for
debate. If, however, the House is willing that
this question shall come up in the morning
hour to-morrow, and that there shall be a
morning honr, I have no objection to yielding
i half an hour for debate on the other side,
t The SPEAKER. It is the duty of the Chair
! to inform the gentleman that the rooming
| hour to-morrow must, under the rules of the
! House, be devoted to the call of committees
I for private business.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then I will inquire of
; the Speaker when this bill will come up again ?
: The SPEAKER. If the bill should go over
i at the expiration of the morning hour to-day
i it would regularly come up again in the ciom-
1 ing hour of Tuesday next.
; Mr. KERR. I hope it will be allowed to
> go over till that time. It would be a burlesque
on legislation to undertake to pass this bill
; after half an hour's discussion. It involves
' many most important questions touching the
i powers of this Government; and yet it is pro-
; posed to rush it through without proper oppor-
; tunity for discussion. I submit that such a
; method of legislation is monstrous.
; Mr. INGERSOLL. I submit that I have
\ not proposed to rush anything through ; nor
J would it, in my opinion, be a '' burlesque upon
legislation" to ask the House to pass this bill
; after a comparatively brief discussion, for
this is not the first time that the attention of
the gentleman and of the House has been
called to this subject. The gentleman must
be aware that the power which it is proposad
to exercise in this bill has been exercised many
times heretofore.
Mr. CLEVELAND and others. Never.
Mr. KERR. Mr. Speaker, I atiirm that there
is nothing in the history of this Government
I that can justify the enactment of this bill.
I Mr. INGERSOLL. That i3 a matter of
j opinion.
Mr. KERR. There is no precedent and no
authority in any law ever enacted by Congress
to justify the passage of this bill, as I will .show
to the House if an opportunity be allowed me.
Mr. SWANN. I ask the gentleman whether
he will permit me to offer an amendment to
this bill?
Mr. INGERSOLL. Not at the present ti me.
Mr. SWANN. Well, I appeal to the gen-
tleman to give us an opportunity to bo heard.
If he will consent to fix some not very distant
I day when gentlemen who oppose thi3 measure
j can be heard, we shall be able, I think, to sat-
I isfy the House that we would establish a most
| dangerous principle if we should announce to
: the country that the power of Congress is to
be exercised in upsetting the whole internal
improvement system of this nation, which has
grow* up under State supervision and by means
of capital furnished by the States. All that I
ask is time that we may be enabled to present
our views on it when this most important ques-
tion shall come up.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Now, Mr. Speaker, I
wish to make a statement.
Mr. TRIMBLE. I hope the gentleman will
yield to me to make a statement in relation to
where the road will go.
Mr. IN GERSOLL. I cannot yield now, but
I will in a little while. I am disposed to be
liberal, and I will be as liberal as the House
. will permit me to be in the present condition
of the public business. If tbe House be will-
ing to fix a day when this bill shall come up
for consideration and let it be made a special
order I am willing that two or three days shall
be devoted to the discussion of the measure if
that be the pleasure of the House. I will tell
gentlemen that then I will allow amendments
to be read and offered and voted on. I ask the
House to make a special order of this bill at
some time to be indicated by the gentlemen on
the Ways and Means and on the Appropriations
Committees, they having charge of much of the
important business of the House.
Mr. SWANN. I understood the gentleman
