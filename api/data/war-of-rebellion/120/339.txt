and not very communicative. In Illinois I hope to be more successful, as they are not so much on their guard in that State. I think it is nipped in the bud in Missouri. They all have had news of Hunt and Dunn's arrest, and have been cautioned by some agent sent from Saint Louis to be on the lookout; so it seems to be loss of time to stay here any longer than to-day, unless I could remain long enough to gain their confidence, which I have not time to do.

Palmyra is a bad nest. All are very bitter against the Government, and hope for a raid into Missouri; say that they will then all join the rebel army, &amp;c. I go to Quincy to-day; will write again there.

Respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM TAYLOR.

I shall look for something from you at Springfield.

QUINCY, ILL., June 17, 1864.

Colonel SANDERSON:

DEAR SIR: I am now at Quincy. Have seen and talked to James S. Green, formerly of Missouri. He says that the Democratic party will protect Vallandigham at all hazards, and he is now in Ohio; but I suppose you are aware of that. Carlin has not returned from Springfield--is there at a convention.

The organization partakes more of the political in this State than in Missouri, and they are much more bold than one would imagine. Dreed and Lee, that you gave me the names as living in Hannibal, are not to be found. The old settlers say that there are no such men living there. I did not learn much in Hannibal; they are working with Illinois, and will do whatever they do. There are two temples in this place. Both are large. They say Anderson is grand worthy of one.

I start to Springfield this evening; will write again there.

Respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM TAYLOR.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 18, 1864.

Colonel SANDERSON:

DEAR SIR: I am now in Springfield, but did not get here as soon as I would have liked to--would have preferred being at this place during the meeting of the Copperhead convention--but think I will do very well, notwithstanding. I have approached several and have found them very communicate. Their intention is to defend Vallandigham at all hazards. Their temples have all passed the same resolutions that the convention passed in relation to him.

I expected to have found a communication from you here, but was disappointed. I will remain here until Tuesday; will write again to-morrow. Expect to be able to give you quite a lot of leading knights.

Respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM TAYLOR.
