WILMINGTON, N. C., December 25, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The enemy renewed the bombardment from the fleet this morning and continued it until sundown with great vigor. About 1 p. m., under cover of a large fleet, they made a lodgment on the mainland three miles north of Fort Fisher, but one brigade of our troops arrived, and they were unable to cover the front. A prisoner reports the enemy's force as one corps, under Butler. Some of our troops are now coming in, and will move down immediately. The unaccountable delay in forwarding them has been most unfortunate. General Whiting is at Fisher. I shall be with the movable troops early to-morrow.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

SUGAR LOAF, [December] 25, 1864.

Lieutenant General T. H. HOLMES:

Clingman's brigade will remain [at] Wilmington; all men of Hagood's and Kirkland's will come to Sugar Loaf; Colquitt's will go to Fort Anderson, and detachments to their proper posts.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

Major V[AN DER HORST]:

Clingman's brigade has been ordered to go into camp. Please attend to the rest of the above.

[FORT FISHER,]

December 25, 1864 - 12.45 p. m.

General BRAGG:

Enemy collecting around the bar; think they will attempt to come in. Firing heavy; casualties so far very few. Garrison under cover waiting for them. We fire but little.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

General BRAGG,

Wilmington:

There are in all four naval officers; forty-two wounded in all this time.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

FORT FISHER, December 25, 1864.

(Via Smithville, 8 p. m.)

General BRAGG:

Our case is very critical. The enemy have landed and are now skirmishing with our troops on the parapet (top of fort). If you can send re-enforcements for Kirkland to attack in the rear we can hold out.

WHITING,

General.
