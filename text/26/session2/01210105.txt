SUGAR   AND   RUW   DRAWBACKS,   AND   HalllNC.
BOUNTIES   AND   ALLOWA\CF3
Mr BENTON rose to submit a resolution m re-
lation to drawbacks on t xported refined su¡>ar and
rum, manufactureJ out of foreign matemW, and
m relation to the fishing bounties aDd allowances,
and as it was a subject on which he hid heretofore
moved, and that frequently, without effect, he «aid
he felt it to be incumbent upon him to give some
reasons to the Senate for again venturing to trouble
them with it. Undismayed by former mscar-
nage«, he would go on with his efforts, whether s e-
rile or successful, unul the evils were cured, or un-
til his Senatorial service ceased, anj he felt very
Certain of making out a c?se for legislative irt"i-
ierence, whether he succeeded in procuring it or
not. Hio resolution embraced three points of
abuse, and he would take them up singly, in order
to present his remarks with more distinctness and
precision
He began with the sugar drawback He said
it was now twelve years since our erroneou, legis-
lation began on that point, and he had the fate or
fortune at that time to point out the eiror and to
predict its consequence0 This was in the year
1828, when the drawback on exported refined su-
gar, without any increase of duty on the foreign ar-
ticle out of which it was manufactured, was in-
creased twenty per cent, that is to say, was raised
from four cents to five cents a poaiid, the duty on ím
ported brown sugar remaining at three cents a
pound. To this increase he then objected, on the
ground that it would restore more duty, m the
shape of drawback, than had been paid on the im
ported sugar, that this excess, of duty would be a
naked bounty out of the Treasury on* a manufac-
tured article, and that the consequence would fee a
great increase in the importation of foreign sugar,
to the prejudice of the hume production, and a
great increase m the amount of drawback paid, to
the injury of the Treasury These were the obj"c-
tiois which he made to the act of 1828, and thp
proof of their correctness was quickly fortocoa uig
The increase in the imports of brown sugar n-any
doubled in five years, lt rose from 50,000 000 of
pounds to 90,000,000 The increase in the draw-
backs exceeded all calculation it ro<e in three
years from about $2 000 (to be precise, $2 045) to
§84,230' Such wss the fruit of the first error
commuted in 1828
The second en or was comrsitted seven years
ago, it was committed in the famous com-
promise act of 1833. That act provided for a re-
duction of duties on all imported articles, to be
made periodically, and to be brought down in 1842
to an ad valorem of 20 per centum, but it mane no
provision for a corresponding reduction of draw-
backs, when the imported article was exported in
a manufactured or altered shape Looking upon
th s defect as an oversight in the framers of the
bill, he ventured to propose an amendment to re-
me 'y the omiss on, when the bill was before the
Senate He submitted an amendment, it was
voted upon by the Senate, and rejected. Tue com-
promise bill then went into operation, and gave in-
creased vigor to the eiror of 1828 Itmcreaied nc
sugar importations in six years from near one
hundred millions to near two hundred millions of
pounds, and it increased th drawback from about
$80 000 to upwards of $600,000 The amount paid
m 1840 was $611 000, wiih an indication of mordí
nate increase—the amount of $75 OOO.bemg already
drawn by a single refiner (Woolsey) at a single city
(New York) in ihe fiist ten days of ihe present year
As the sugar duty is now reduced 40 per cent un ier
the compromise act, and the drawback was already
too high by 20 per cent under the act of 1828, it fol-
lows that six-tenths of all the drawback on refined
sugar exported last year, was a naked bounty of
the Treasury, in flagrant violation of the Constitu-
tion, to toe ereat enrichment of a few individuals,
and to the deep injury cf the Treasuiy Justice to
the Constitution and the Treasury requires this
evil to be stopped, it has certainly reached a point
high enough to arrest the attention ot the Legisla-
ture, and to command a remedy If it has not, it
will by next year, when the drawback will become
nearly ahelear bounty—when rear two millions of
dolíais will be required to pay it—wh n the while
sugar revenue of the Union will be íutdequate to
the payment—and when moneys must be borrowed,
01 raised by other taxes, to meet the demand
The nest article he w< uld men ion was that of
ihe rum drawback It was small, in comparison
to the drawback on sugar, but was sti'l an evil de-
serving of legislative interposition The error in
this article began m the compromise act, an I had
been running on since its passage The amend-
ment which he then offered, and which he hid re
fened to, wis intended to embrace the rum,asxvell
as the s,ugar drawback It w^s rejected by the Se-
nate, and consequently, as the duty on rrolasses
went down, and the drawback ren amed stationary,
a part of the drawback became clear tounty, and
stimulated the distiller to earn more of it The
drawback on exported rum has, therefoie, increased
ten or twenty fold it has risen fiom one or two
thousand dollars to $22 000 The molasses duty
being reduced about 40 per centum, ltrcsuUei that
four tenths of this drawback was a naked bounty
out of the Treasury, and to that extent was a viola-
tion of the Constitution, as well as a pecuniary loss
After 1842, if nothing is done, four-fifths of this
rum drawback will be naked bounty
Tne third and last aitir'e which he took up was
the fishing bounties and allowances The erro-
neous hgtslatioQ en this point commenced, he said,
in the year 1830, when the duty on salt was reduced
one half (by two annual reductions) anl no corre
spond ng reduction made in the fiAing bov lties and
allow anees founded upon that duty, and was con-
tinued by the compromise act v. hich provided for
further penodiea! reductions of the salt tax with
out any corresponding reduction of the fishing
bounties and allowances He had attempted to
expose this error, and to correct it, on both these
occasions, but without success No diminution of
the fishing bounties and allowances cou'd be effect-
ed, consequently, they have been iinig while the
duty has been going down The dutv on salt has
sunk about two-thirds, say fr m 20 cen*s per
bushel to about six, the fishing bounties have ns n
about one-thirl, that is to say, from about
$220 000 to about $330 000 Two th rds of
this sum cesses to be founded on the «alt duiy,
con.equently becomes a bounty act of the Treasury,
and, like the excess in the sugai and rum draw-
backs, brcomes to that extent a gratuity from the
Treasury, and an infraction of th? Consti'ution
For un years the Treasury has been paying this
gratuity to the cod fisheries, beginning at about
$100 000 of gratuity, and reaching last year about
$220,000 of gramity This year it will be still
larger, and in 1842, when the compromise ha*
reduced the salt tax to an ad valorem of twenty per
cent the amount paid will be still increased, and
nearly the whole will be a naked gratuity, and the
salt tax not sufficient to pay it. The tax, on our
average importations of about one million of dol-
lars' worth, will be only $200,000, while the boun-
ties and allowances, increasing as for some years
past (and the temptation to increase becomes
stronger every day) will be about $400,000.
The spectacle will then be presented of aa
entire nation taxed in its salt for the sake of
presenting the amount to few thousand fisher-
men, and the product of the tax not being sufficient,
oiher taxes must make up the deficiency
He said he had been raising his voice "solitary
a ul «Zone" for years past, to wake up the Senate
and the country to the errors of our legislation in
relation to the tnree points to which he now called
attention—'he sugar drawback, the rum drawback,
and the fishing bounties and allowances He had
been raising his voice solitarily to this effect he had
been standing almost alone up to the present time.
but at last other vsices had come to his assistance.
The collector of tne port at New York, (Mr
Hoyt,) pours into the Treasury Department a con-
tinued succession of letters to show th' alarm-
ing amounts of the sugar drawbacks, and
the rapidity of their increase, the Secretary of
the Treasury, (Mr Woodbury,) both in hi  annnal
rjport on the finances, and in a late recommenda-
tion for the i sue of five or six mi lions of Treasu-
sury notes, hascalled the attention of Congress both
to the sugar drawbacks and the fishing bounties
and allowances, and has earnestly called for some
legislative act on to p-otect the Treasury from their
heavy drains The drains were indeed heavy, and
might wed make the Secretary begin to cry out
They were near a million of dollars last year, will
probably be near two millions next year, and three
the ye?r after if not arrested Two thirds of what
is now drawn, is unjustly and unconstitutionally
drawn, as the duties increase thi  proportion in-
crease', andrwill soon be three fourths or four-
fifhs Mr Benton then submitted his resolu-
tion  as  follows-
Resolved, That the Committee on Finance be m-
ueted to inquire into the expediency of reducing
the drawbacks on refined "ugar and rum, manufac-
tured out of foreign materials, and exported,m pro-
portion to the reduction which has taken plate, and
will tike place under existing laws,in the duties on
impo ted sugar and molasses, also of reducing the
hshmg bounties and allowances in proportion to
the reduction which has taken place, and shall take
place, under existing laws, in the duty on imported
salt
The resolution was considered and agreed to.
The following bills were considered as in com-
mittee of the whole, and ordered to be engrossed
fir a third reading
