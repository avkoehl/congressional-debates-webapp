General ROUSSEAU:

The following telegram has just been received from Huntsville:

A scout returned here this evening; he went within four miles of Warrenton; saw no rebel force. Citizens report to him that on Friday last Hood's army was at Bristow's Cove, between Gadsden and Blountsville, his pioneer corps advancing toward the latter place. No one seemed to know his intentions. Will have more definite information from other scouts.

WM. P. LYON,

Commanding.

The river is so low about Guntersville that the gun-boats, except the Stone River, cannot pass. If Hood is back of Huntersville I should think his cavalry might ford. I sent there to-day a company of cavalry to patrol the river and act as couriers. They should reach there some time to-night. Two thousand infantry and a battery of artillery would almost insure their not crossing. If the two regiments you mentioned reach here to-night, and I can have one day's time, I can make this place very defensible.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, October 25, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

I would respectfully and urgently request that 1,000 men from Colonel Sipes' command at Columbia be ordered to report to me at once. Three hundred and forty men of the Thirteenth Wisconsin, upon whom depended for the protection of the railroad between Huntsville and Larkinsville and along the river, are all sick with the ague, and at best are only fit for duty every other day. Nearly all the men I have had on duty at the block-houses and upon the river this summer are prostrated by this re-enforcement, which I trust you will direct at once. Of eighty-five men stationed at Claysville but twenty-five are fit for duty. I have ordered a company of cavalry to that place as scouts and couriers.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Thomas.)

DECATUR, October 25, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

Captain Morton, of gun-boat General Thomas, telegraphed that he patrolled the river all last night from Hobson's Island, four miles above Whitesburg, to Beard's Bluff, three miles below Claysville. He fired a few shell at various points; was at Fort Deposit and Beard's Bluff about midnight. At both these places the enemy were seen last night making demonstration to cross; also a force of 200 or 300 Whitesburg. He goes up again soon. River still falling two inches in twenty-four hours, and so low he cannot pass below the island two miles above Whitesburg.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
