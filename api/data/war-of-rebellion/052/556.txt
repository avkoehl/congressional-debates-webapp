WAR DEPARTMENT,

September 11.

The Secretary of War directs that you immediately join General Burnside in the field with all your staff.

H. W. HALLECK,

I have ordered my staff down from Indianapolis to Lexington, and shall leave Wednesday morning, by Dayton and Toledo Railroad, for Cincinnati. Would like to meet you and General Cox at Burnet House Monday night, on arrival of Dayton train.

AT HOME, September 11, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: In obedience to orders, I have the honor to report the supplies found thus far in Union County. New crops of wheat (now thrashed) and corn, very good. There is but little or no bacon, but few beef cattle. To-day the company is going to Powell's Valley, Campbell County, where I understand there are more supplies, and, perhaps, rebel stores. The citizens are nearly all loyal. The company is faring well.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. L. PHILLIPS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Expedition.
