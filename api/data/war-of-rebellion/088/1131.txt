Major-General WARREN, Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you have ut past Poplar Spring Church and endeavor to secure the intersection of the Squirrel Level road, so as to enable us to gain a position on the right of the enemy. General Parke will follow and support you and also try to open a route across the swamp below Poplar Spring Church so as to reach Miss Pegram's. Gregg will be directed to move out to Wilkinson's.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Poplar Spring Church, September 30, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: I have got General Griffin's division at this point and drawn the fire of the enemy's artillery. A heavy piece of wood intervenes between this place and them, and I can see nothing myself. I am widening out the road and getting my command up and in order. I shall let General Parke pass General Ayres, who will guard our right, and let General P[arke] endeavor to pass around the enemy's right, if he desires, while I operate against his position near here.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 30, 1864-1 p. m.

Major-General WARREN, Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Ferrero is directed to extend his line from Fort Howard to Fort Wadsworth and relieve a brigade of Crawford's, which will be held in reserve for exigencies. I suppose you will keep up some connection with the Weldon railroad. Is there not a road or route direct from Fort Wadsworth to Poplar Spring Church that can be opened and used?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 30, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

General Griffin has just carried the intrenchments on Peebles' farm in splendid style. Our loss not very great. The breast-works were defended by infantry and cavalry, and we have taken a number of prisoners. I send you to-day's rebel paper.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
