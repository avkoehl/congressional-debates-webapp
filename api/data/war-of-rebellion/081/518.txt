HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 30, 1864-9.20 a.m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

General Katuz has sent his command back to Bermuda Hundred to refit and get supplies. I beg to suggest orders be sent to General Butler requiring General Kautz to return at the earliest practicable moment to report to General Sheridan. The enemy have the whole of their cavalry south of the Appomattox, and with the loss of Wilson and his own losses Sheridan will be weak and will require all the cavalry we can get together, else I fear we shall have trouble with the enemy's cavalry in our rear.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, City Point, Va., June 30, 1864-12 noon.

Major-General MEADE:

Orders have been sent to Kautz to remain with Sheridan, or to report to him in fe he has left.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, June 30, 1864.

(Received 1.20 p.m.)

Major-General MEADE:

The following has been sent to Brigadier-General Katuz.* You will give him such orders as may be deemed necessary, taking into consideration the condition of his command.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 30, 1864-10 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Nothing additional has been heard of or from Wilson. Sheridan did not reach Reams' Station until late his afternoon. On consultation with General Wright, they concluded nothing could be done to aid Wilson, and Wright started to return. So soon as this was reported I sent orders and halted Wright on the plank road some five miles from the left of the army, and sent instructions to Sheridan to move at early and endeavor to obtain some information about him or the enemy, and to call on Wright for support, who would remain in his present position till he (Sheridan) returned. From all the information that has been gathered from citizens and contrabands, there is every reason to believe the enemy's infantry returned last night to Petersburg, leaving the pursuit of Wilson to the cavalry.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
