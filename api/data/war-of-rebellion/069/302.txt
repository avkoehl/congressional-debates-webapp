Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Norman's House, May 29, 1864 - 3.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Griffin's division has moved out on the road to Shady Grove. It carries him 1 mile south of Totopotomoy before it branches off to the west. After his advance had moved in that direction about half a mile they struck the enemy's infantry skirmishers on the road south. Only the enemy's cavalry are to be seen. Negroes report that the enemy is in force at Shady Grove, on the north side of the Totopotomoy. My line is now established, and my troops disentangled from the Ninth Corps. Our position gives us no use for artillery. I am now going out myself with the reconnoitering force.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Wright has got within one-fourth of a mile of the railroad. Hanover Court-House in sight, only meeting cavalry. Keep Griffin up to the enemy and support him. Burnside is in reserve on your right flank and rear to assist you if necessary.
