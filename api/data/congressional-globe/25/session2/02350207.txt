did, and representing a people who acknowledge
no code or system of law but such as is derived
from Bivme authority, or from regularly constitu-
ted and established civil sovernment, he felt it to be
a duty, with which he could not dispense, to intro-
duce this bill In doing so, (si d Mr P ) I have
been moved by no meie transient orfugitive feeling
of the moment, by no mere excitement, growing
out of a very recent and \ery lamentaba -event,
though it is somewhat difficult, I must congas, en-
tirely to repress or overcome the emotions w hich
that event has produced Although the event to
which I allude has carried, a  we all know it has,
lamentation and wo unspeakable, unutterable an-
guish and agony of heart, to an innocent and unof-
fending family, and is fiUed to awaken, here and
every wheie, sensations of the deepest grief and
son oh, notwithstanding all this, I ha\e nothing to
do, nothing to say, concerning the transaction, m
my place here It is past and gone We cannot
recall the dead to life We cannot repair the
wrong and inj ury which ha\ e been done But v e
can provide for the future We can do what be-
comes, us to prevent so fatal, so heart-iendmg an
occurrence hereafter.
Sir, (continued Mr P ) in bringing in this bill, I
have acted, as I have said, from no meie impulse of
overwrought sensibility, from no mere tempora-
ry excited feeling I have been influenced by
higher, more stable, and laatmg moaves, by princi-
ples ot action deeper seUled, more permament and
enduring, principles which remain the same in all
times and under all circumstances I am influ-
enced upon pnnciples which look upon duelling as
a crime, a= an offence agamst high Heaven, for-
bidlen and condemned alike by religion and mo-
ral itv, by the laws of God and man
Sir, I mignt here, with no impiopriety, speak of
the spirit of insubordination and lawless viol  ic 
which is abroad m the land, nitectmg and pen ad-
ing, it would seem, entire communities, threatening
the subversion of the establ shed institutions of the
countiy, and which, if not checl ed and subdued,
will, it is to be fpared, sooner or liter, overthrow
all law and all government, and open the w ay to
brutal anarchy and misrule, to scene  of civd strife
and disorder, as sanguinary as terrific, as am
which marked the ferocious and bloody annals of
revolutionary France
But, sir, my purpose is confined to a single, a
particular object It is to prohibit and suppress a
practice here, which, if not stopped, must ultimate-
ly, m addition to other deplorable consequences of
a private and social nature, put an end to all free-
dom of debate and action in your halls of legisla-
tion, banish from them all just and nghttul autho-
rity, and substitute the dominion oí meie biute
force in its place
Mr President, mbiingmg forward this measure,
I repeat I have acted from a hisrh sense of dut\
The moral and religious pnnciples m which I have
been educated, and which I regard as binding upon
me in a'l crcumstances and st'uatuns, whether
public 01 private, in which I am placed, would not
allow mi to hoi 1 a seat here, and remain inactive
in this matter And I call upon Senators, upon
grave considerate Senators, head ot families, fa-
thers of the land, to interpose tneir author! y and
influence to stay a practice as unsu kd U the en-
lightened age in which we live, as it is revolting to
the moral and religious fetlins, of the country 1
Gall upon them by their reg-ird to the rising genera
Uon, upon whom the hopes of the country rest, by
their regard to the eternal and immutable en ciples
of moral recti ude, bj eveiv consmeialion of jus
tice and humanity, by the duty the) owe to Go.
and their countr), to give then aid and support to
a measure demanded by the moral <ense oí the na-
tion, and no less necessary to maintain freedom of
discussion here, than it is essential to personal se-
curity, and to the preservation of law, liberty, and
social order

teidiy irom the Committee on the District
The question pending, was on making the dura-
tion of appointments ior foui vears, reported as
an amendment uy Mr Dvwson, fiom the Com-
mittee on the District
This amendment w as briefly opposed bj Messrs
PATTON and MERCER, and suppoited Messis

meet the objection, moved tint the operation of

11 he objection to the amendment was based on
the giound that the authonty oí Congiess to legis-
late on tins muter was derived from the Constitu-
tion, under which all judges were appointe 1 during
good behavior, and that this was a United States
court, 'tid should be governed by that provision
To this it w as replied, tint the court «as antecedent
to the Constitution, having been originally oigamzed
undei the laws of Maij land, prior to the cession
of the Distuct, and Congress, as tne local legisla-
ture of the District, wa not i stncted by ihat

quantity oí public land
Mr J contiaued his remarks till the expiration
of the morning hour, when
The CHAIR, announced the private orders
Mr CAMBRELENG said he hoped he would
have the assent of the chairman of the Committee
of Claims, and the leave of the House, for a sus-
pension of the private bills, m order to go on with
the appropriation bills, and he made that motion
accordingly
The CHAIR was about dividing the House,
when,
Mr CAMBRELENG called for the yeas and

nays 36
So the rules were suspended
The CHAIR laid before the House the following

PENSION BILL.
The House then took up the " bill making ap-
piopnations for the payment oí Revolutionary and
other pensioners of the United States, for the year
1838," the question being on its engrossment
Mr CURTIS then reiterated his charges in rela-
toin ti the use of the balances m their hands by
tne pen ion agents
The debate was fmth~r continued on the same
side by Mr  CHAMBERS
Mr CAMBRELENG leplied, and expressed the
hope that the two gentlemen would keep in mind
their sound and convincing arguments against bank
agencies, and when the bill came up, which he had
the honor to report jesterdav, to dispense with all
bink agencies in the management of the public
levenues, give it their hearty assent Mr C en-
tered into a variety of statements on the subject.
He suggested a remedj, and the only one The
large balances said to be in the hands of pension
agents, grew out ot the accumulation of past
pensions remaining unclaimed, and a law should
be passed providing for their being returned to
tne Treasury after they had been unclaimed for
tweh e months As a member of the Committee of
Ways and Means, he should do his best to secure
the introduction and adoption of such a remedy.
Mi C also sent to the Cleik's table, to be read to
the House, a number of letters Irom agents to the
Commissioner, which w ent to establish the position
he had taken, and to show that the money was not
u*ed by the agents individually, but bj the banks
in which the money was deposited
Mr CUSHMAN said he had heard no objection
made against this bill, but all seen ed to concui in
the necessity of its passage
Mr BELL     But not to the whole amount
Mr CUSHMAJN had, nevertheless, heard no
argument against the necessity of its passage Mr
C then went on to teply to Mr Cirtis, and m
•vindication of Gov Hill
Mr HAYNES said he had devoted to this dis-
cussion all the attention which the state of his
healt i w ould permit lie had been gratified by
the course of the discussion, and agreed entirely
with those who objected to the use of the public
money by officeis and agents to whom it was com-
mitted
From the manner m which the debate had been
conducted by some gentlemen, it w ould seem that
Solomon was far less wise than mankind had gen-
erally considered him, and that those who objected
to the use of the public money b> pension agents,
had m Iced d'scoveied something new under the
sun But he had risen, m part, for tne purpose of
stating that the fact is not so That e\ er since ihe
