SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 10, 1863

Brigadier-General DAVIES:

I think it would be well to call in your troops from Houston and Salem, and watch the passes of the Gasconade between Rolla and Lebanon. The rebel force that has gone north of the Osage may try to escape between Roll and Lebanon. General Fisk started 200 cavalry for Rolla last night, and will send more as soon as he can call them in from the south.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

ROLLA, MO., October 10, 1863-1.45 p.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I had thought such might be the case, and the Houston troops will be in to-day, and the artillery from Salem came in yesterday. Sitton's company from Cuba came in here yesterday, by my orders. I shall not take the two companies from Salem till the last moment, and then to replace troops from here in case of a movement. I will do as you direct, but would wish to be kept advised as to the position of the rebels.

THOS. A. DAVIES.

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 10, 1863

Brigadier-General DAVIES:

If possible, send forward force enough to open communication with Lebanon; it is important for me to get orders to troops beyond that. General McNeil will be at Rolla this p.m., and will want an escort to Lebanon. If the rebels cross the Gasconade, it will probably be at mouth of Little Piney or Waynesville; by keeping scouts on opposite side, you can get timely information.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Rebels in possession of railroad from California to Syracuse and above. Nothing new.

CLOWRY.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 10, 1863-6 p.m.

Brigadier-General BROWN, Sedalia, Mo.

Glad to hear from you.* Colonel Morton has moved up from Lebanon. He and Colonel Edwards are ordered to watch the rebels from Warsaw to Tuscumbia. Ewing is moving northeast, via Warrensburg. Totten is at Jefferson City with 1,200 or 1,500 men mostly infantry. The enemy was on the railroad near Tipton this morning. Try to corner him, if possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
