were brought in by my direction by Captain Jacob P. Kreider, Company F, One hundred and forty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, with volunteers from Companies A and F, One hundred and forty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers Infantry, and men from Bundy's battery. For this action Captain Kreider and the men with him are deserving of praise. These two pieces were placed in position, which, with the two already faced to the right, gave us an excellent and destructive fire on the enemy's flank and read. The execution done by these pieces was made manifest after the fight was over. During the whole of this time the firing in my proper front was regularly and coolly given on the enemy, who seemed determined to break through the lines. At the opening of the action the Third Division, Twentieth Army Corps, made connection on the left of my line, forming an obtuse angle with the works of my regiment. The fire from that portion of this line bearing on the corn-field, together with the fire from the artillery, and from my regiment, rendered all attempts of the enemy to break through the lines futile and repelled each attempt with loss. Finding that all their efforts were unsuccessful and attended with such loss, the enemy, with the exception of a few sharpshooters, abandoned the field. The night was passed in comparative quiet, but the works were strengthened and preparations made to meet any attack that might by made. The losses in my regiment were very small, I am truly glad to say, and is attributed to the coolness and deliberation with which they delivered their fire, and to the protection afforded by the rail barricade, and last, not least, to the fact that they remained in their places. It seems invidious to particularize where all did their duty, but I cannot but compliment Lieutenant Colonel John Craig and Captain Jacob P. Kreider for their coolness and cheering influence with the men at a time when, to judge from the mass of disorganized men rushing to the rear, one might conclude that destruction and defeat were inevitable. The day following the battle of Peach Tree Creek, July 21, was spent in burying the dead and gathering the arms and accouterments from the field of battle. Friday, July 22, we marched to near Atlanta and went into position on a range of hills to the left of the railroad, between the Marietta and Buck Head roads. Here we threw up a strong line of works. In this position we remained until Tuesday, July 26, when we advanced about 300 yards and occupied a new line of works. The position of the regiment was on the right of the brigade. During the time we remained in these works we were occasionally subjected to a severe shelling from the rebels, but with the exception of his and the usual picket-firing nothing of any importance transpired. Accompanying this report please find a report of casualties to and inclusive of August 4, 1864.* In conclusion I beg leave to thank the officers and men of the regiment for their uniform good conduct and the cheerfulness manifested in the discharge of their duties, which have been continuous and arduous during the entire campaign.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARIO PARDEE, JR.,

Colonel 147th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, Commanding

Lieutenant A. H. W. CREIGH,

A. A. A. G., 1st Brigadier, 2nd Div., 20th Army Corps.
