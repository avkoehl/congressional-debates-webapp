By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., August 7, 1864-12 m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Do not hesitate to give commands to officers in whom you repose confidence, without regard to claims of others on account of rank. If you deem Torbert the best man to command the cavalry, place him in command and give Averell some other command, or relieve him from the expedition, and order him to report to General Hunter. What we want is prompt and active movements after the enemy in accordance with instructions you already have. I feel every confidence that you will do the very best, and will leave you as far as possible to act on your own judgment, and not embarrass you with orders and instructions.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 7, 1864-12.15 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding, &c., Harper's Ferry, Va.:

The Departments of Washington, the Middle, the Susquehanna, and of Western Virginia, have been formed into a military division called the Middle Division, and you have been assigned to the temporary command. Orders will be sent to you by mail at once. You can assume command without further authority.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
