RICHMOND, January 15, 1865. (Received 17th.)

General J. B. HOOD:

Your request is complied with. General Beauregard is instructed to relieve you. On being relieved, you will report to the War Department in Richmond.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

MERIDIAN, MISS., January 15, 1865.

His Excellency President DAVIS:

My telegram of the 9th expressed the conviction that an attempt to move Hood's army at this time would complete its destruction. Hood failed to hold Thomas in check with Forrest, Roddey, and his own cavalry, and 30,000 troops to assist them. To represent those 30,000, I have barely 3,000 inefficient cavalry outside of the inadequate garrison of Mobile. I think it would be beneficial to the cause for me to see you.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.
