HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES
Momjat, FebrumySS, 1835
T he House resumed the consideration of the
mo i>n to print the preamble and resolutiors of
die Legislatuie of the State of Vermont, in rela
tion to the Public Lands, tne Bank of the United
S ate^, ard tne removal of tne deposites
M. &>LAlDE said it had been contended by the
gentlemen trom New York [Messis TuRRiLLand
Bcardslcv ] that the resolutions were disiespectful
to the House He wished the gentlemen to point
out in what particulai, either in torm oi substance,
these proceedings were disrespecful He made
the request the more earnestly, because, if the
printing was refused, it vvomd go forth to the
world, that resolutions presented by a member of
the HrJvjse, which had passed the Legis'atuie of
Vermont, were considered unfit to be entered en
the Journal of this House
Mr BOON moved to lay the motion to print on
the table
O i this motion Mr H EVERETT demanded
the yeas and nays, which were ordeied, and were
—ye¡ s 32, nays 139
Sj the House refused to lay the motion to punt
on tne table
Mi bLADE reiterated Ins former remarks,
which he said had not nad the effect of pioducng
tl.-> specifkatioi s wl ic! he had requ red of the
gent'emer, fiom New "V ork Fie was no gieat
st elder foi State rights, but he began to think that
the aJvocte of State rights had more rea ion than ¡
hereiofoie tor maintpining theu giound From a
source which he need not desoíate, great dangei
to tne just rights of the Spates had arisen, and in
the pie-ent posture ct affairs he was d sposed
to stand upon the giound of State soveieigruy,
a1inou n he coul J not go as fa- as son e of its advo-
cates ° He contended in conclusion thattlepie-
amb'e and resolutions weie íespectfui, and that
the Legislature of Veimont had a light to beheaid
and then proceeuings spread upon the Jot rnals of
the House                                                            ,

moved to lay the motion to punt on the table, to
avoid a long ard useless debate, foi which time
was no time He did not object to receiving the
views of a sovereign State fue íesolutions had
been received by the House, and by referring
them to a committee, nothing more, he conceived,
was necessary to be done
The question was then taken, and the motion to
print earned—yeas 159, nays 32.
