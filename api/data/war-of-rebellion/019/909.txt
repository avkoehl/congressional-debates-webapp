The committee appointed by a meeting of the officers of the First Brigade of Missouri Volunteers to prepare suitable resolutions and such other papers and may be necessary to give a full expression of their sentiments in regard to the outrages committed upon our fellow-citizens in Missouri by the authority and action of the Federal Army now in our State, in having 1 captain and 9 privates shot as a retaliation for the loss of 1 man said to be killed by our men, we beg leave to submit for the considerable of the officers of the brigade the following preamble and resolutions:
