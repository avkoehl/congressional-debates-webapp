KINSTON, March 14, 1865.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD,

New Berne:

Get the strength, organization, and names of commanders of the troops arriving from the south as fast as they arrive and inform me. Have all that are not required at Morehead and New Berne made ready to come to the front. They can come by rail as far as it will not interfere with the construction of the road, and then march. Let all wagons for the front march from New Berne with suitable guards, and bring light loads of supplies for the troops, I have telegraphed General Terry to march the main body of his troops to this place.
