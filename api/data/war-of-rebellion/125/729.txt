WASHINGTON, D. C., September 16, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In obedience to instructions from His Excellency the Governor of Missouri, I came to this city (arriving here the day before yesterday) for the purpose of procuring credits upon the quota of Missouri under the late call for men who have enlisted into regiments from other States prior to said call, and which have not heretofore been credited.

The claims which I presented were as follows:

First. Men enlisted in Iowa regiments from the State

of Missouri prior to April 1, 1864, as certified to

by the adjutant-general of Iowa..................... 583

NOTE.-Upon a similar cerfiticate given by me to the

adjutant-general of Iowa a claim for 1,142 men who had

enlisted from Iowa into Missouri regiments was allowed

and credited to that States. (See letter from the Adjutant- General's Office, dated august 19, 1864, and one from the

Provost-Marshal-General's Office, same date, the former

signed by Major Thomas M. Vincent, assistant adjutant-general,

and the latter by Captain T. a. Dodge, Veteran Reserve Corps,

in charge of Enrollment Bureau.)

Second. Men enlisted from Missouri in the following Kansas regiments prior to December 30, 1863, viz, the First, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh, as certified to by the adjutant-

general of Kansas........................................... 391

Third. Men enlisted from Missouri in the following Kansas

regiments prior to December 30, 1863, viz, the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Thirteenth, and Fifteenth, as certified to by Major O. D. Greene, assistant adjutant-general, from the records of the Department of the Missouri................................... 309

NOTE.-these regiments are not included in the certificate of

the adjutant-general of Kansas, from the fact that no muster or descriptive rolls of them were at the time of its issue on file

in his office.

Fourth. Men enlisted from Missouri in Arkansas regiments prior

to January 1, 1864, as certified to by Major O. D. Greene,

assistant adjutant-general, Department of the Missouri, from muster-in rolls on file in his office........................ 444

NOTE.-These men were enlisted in the State of Missouri while

the regiments were being formed, and rendezvoused at points in Missouri under the direction of the general commanding the Department of the Missouri in 1862 and 1863, and were composed principally of refugees from Arkansas.

----In all....................................................... 1,727

In addition to the above I presented claim for ninety men enlisted in the First Nebraska Infantry (now cavalry) from Missouri, as certified to from its original muster-in rolls by the colonel of that regiment in compliance with an agreement made between him and the late Governor of Missouri, which permitted him to enlist in Missouri for his regiment; thus making an aggregate of 1,817 claimed, which were thought to be justly due and properly vouched for.

Upon making known to you my business, I was referred by you to General James B. Fry, the Provost-Marshal-General, who in turn
