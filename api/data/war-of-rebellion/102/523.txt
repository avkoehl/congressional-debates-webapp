Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I was in error in my dispatch of this morning in relation to the number of recruits of the Missouri State Militia who are to be mustered out under the order of the Secretary of War. Upon a more careful examination I find that but 136 recruits of the Eighth Cavalry Missouri State Militia are to be mustered out, the terms of the indorsement applying only to the men who signed the application.

Kelly is still pursuing them. Captain Rubey left here this morning with the escort accompanying the paymaster.
