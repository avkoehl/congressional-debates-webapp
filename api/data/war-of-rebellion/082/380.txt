Has General Birge brought his brigade up? If he has not, see that it comes up before tattoo. General Butler expects mischief on our front.

General TERRY,

Tenth Corps:

I have applied for material to throw another bridge, so as to enable re-enforcements to reach the Eleventh Maine. This will take some time, however, and in the meantime I think General Foster must act as his judgment dictates; he being on the ground is the best judge. He should not risk that regiment too much. Please give him these instructions.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864.

(Received 9.15 p. m.)

General WEITZEL:

Are your anticipations of trouble on your front sufficiently strong to render it advisable for the troops to lie in the trenches to-night?

A. H. TERRY,Brigadier-General.
