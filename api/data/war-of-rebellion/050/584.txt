This position having become entirely untenable the command was compelled to fall back somewhat precipitately. The rifled section of the battery under Lieutenant Williams, after doing splendid execution, had finally to be abandoned. The caissons were brought off, and the remainder of the battery was saved only through the almost superhuman efforts of Captain Sutermeister, and his men.

The command was rallied in a disorganized condition, being united with portions of other brigades and divisions on the ridge in rear of our position. A large force having been rallied, it was moved by a mountain road toward the center, to a point on the Chattanooga and La Fayette road, 3 miles from Rossville, when it was reformed and took up position. By your order it soon removed, this brigade in advance, passing via Rossville on the Ringgold road 3 miles to -Church, arriving about dusk. Here the column halted until about 9 o'clock, when, by your order, it returned to Rossville.

Monday, the 21st, remained at Rossville erecting strong barricades. Some skirmishing, in which the brigade was not engaged.

At 2.30 o'clock on the morning of the 22nd the command fell back from that place upon Chattanooga, taking position with the right resting upon the river, near the rolling mill, at daylight in the morning.

Some embarrassment in making this report results from the fact that orders received by General Lytle for movements while on the march in command of the rear guard were upon his person when he fell, and cannot therefore be obtained for reference, and from the fact that during the active part of the battle and until advised of his death, I only received orders concerning the disposition of my own regiment.

Herewith is forwarded a list* of casualties in the brigade. While it is painful to reflected that such men must be sacrificed, it is a glorious consolation to know that none fell but in the discharge of the highest and holiest duty which can devolve upon man as a citizen or a soldier. Colonel William B. McCreery, of the Twenty-first Michigan, fell mortally wounded while gallantly leading his regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel Wells, of the same regiment, was killed while bravely performing his duty. Major Chase, upon whom the command then devolved, performed his duties with signal efficiency and bravery. Captain Bishop and Adjutant Morse, of this regiment, particularly distinguished themselves. Lieutenant-Colonel West, of the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin, was also wounded while at the head of his regiment in the thickest of the fight, and fell into the hands of the enemy. Major von Baumbach, thus placed in command, acquitted himself with credit and honor. Lieutenant-Colonel Chadbourne, of the Eighty-eighth Illinois, distinguished himself by his perfect calmness in the most trying circumstances in the discharge of his duties. He was ably assisted by Major Chandler. Lieutenant-Colonel Olson and Major Sherman, of the Thirty-sixth Illinois, deserve special mention for their skill and daring; both had their horses shot under them, and were very efficient in leading the men in the fight and rallying and reforming the lines. Adjutant Miller, of the Eighty- eight Illinois, Adjutant Clark, of the Thirty-sixth Illinois, and Adjutant Balding, of the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin rendered themselves conspicuous by their bravery and usefulness.

For further mention of meritorious conduct on the part of officers and men I refer to reports of regimental commanders. The conduct
