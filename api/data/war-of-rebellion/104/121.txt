FROM ALABAMA.-THE DEMONSTRATION AGAINST MOBILE.-PREPARATION FOR THE SIEGE.

AUGUSTA, March 25.

The preparation for the defense of Mobile are very complete. Provisions for a six-months' siege have been accumulated. General Taylor has done everything for the successful defense of the city.

AUGUSTA, March 26.

The demonstration against Mobile, and the flank movement from Pensacola and Milton, are still threatened.

FROM EAST TENNESSEE.

Thomas, having transferred a portion of his army to Knoxville and united with Gillem, is said to be moving in the direction of the Virginia line. At last accounts the advance had reached the vicinity of Greenville, a little over half way from Knoxville to Bristol. the expedition is accompanied by an engineer corps of 2,000 men, who are engaged in rebuilding the railroad as fast as the enemy marches. Communication with the base at Knoxville will thus be kept up. The object of this expedition is, no doubt, to possess and hold Southwestern Virginia, and, if practicable, to move on and capture Lynchburg and thus co-operate with Grant in compelling the evacuation of Richmond and Virginia. The scheme is well conceived, but it will be apt to miscarry in the execution, just as two others have.
