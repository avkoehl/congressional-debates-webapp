and Meridian. They have just returned. They penetrated Alabama 100 miles and ascertained that none of Bragg's army had gone to either Columbus or Meridian by way of the east road. The force that was reported to have gone to Meridian were conscripts from Alabama and Georgia, and there was quite a force of them. Their force at Decatur only an outposts of Bragg's army to watch us and gather provisions; it is small. Several small bands of cavalry are on all the roads mentioned, gathering forage and provisions. The scout was a very daring and successful one, and settles the flying reports from that quarter.

The following dispatch from General Dodge just received:

CORINTH, MISS., December 16, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I have men in direct from Shelbyville, Tenn., left the 8th and crossed the Tennessee at Eastport. All the army at Shelbyville and south had been ordered to Torgue [Lavergne], Tenn., also most of cavalry. The bulk of the stores were kept at Chattanooga, they having eight days' on hand. Johnston has entire command and they intend to make a stand at Torgue. The bridge at Bridgeport is finished. A large number of deserters are coming to our lines from Bragg's army-West Tennessee and Arkansas troops. They corroborate the above generally. When these men left, most of Forrest's cavalry was up on Cumberland River, west of Nashville. Buckner's command occupied Shelbyville and marched to Torgue December 6. Colonel Warren was killed in fight in Tuscumbia.

OXFORD, MISS., December 6, 1862.

(Received 5.40 p.m.)

Bragg is said to be going toward the Tennessee River through Waynesborough. Rosecrans ought to push them and if possible gun-boats ought to be sent up the Tennessee.

WASHINGTON, December 18, 1862-10.30 a.m.

The troops in your department, including those from Curtis' command, which join down-river expedition, will be divided into four army corps. It is the wish of the President that General McClernand's corps shall constitute a part of the river expedition and that he shall have the immediate command under your direction.

General-in-Chief.
