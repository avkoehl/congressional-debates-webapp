telegraph to the War Department the day your troops will reach Parkersburg, in order that trains may be prepared to bring them on. Hurry the movements. Troops are very much needed here. It is deemed best by the War Department that you should remain in command in Western Virginia.

By command of Major-General Pope:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA,Cedar Mountain, Va., August 11, 1862-3.30 p. m.

H. W. HALLECK, Major-General:

In compliance with your telegraph of this date I shall place my command in favorable position in this immediate vicinity and operate on the enemy's communications. The only hazard in such a policy is that sappiness of the Army of the Potomac renders it easy for the enemy to re-enforce Jackson heavily. Of that, however, you must be the judge.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA,Cedar Mountain, Va., August 11, 1862-7.15 p. m.

H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I telegraphed you the other day in relation to a brigade belonging to this command now at Winchester. That point belongs properly to the system of defense of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The troops at Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg would more completely cover the road at Winchester than in their present position. Winchester is fortified and armed and easily defensible. If you will have three regiments sent there from Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg I can have the 3,000 men now there that belong to this command. I hope you will do so.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK:

The enemy has been receiving re-enforcements all day. Longstreet's division now on the march from Orange Court-House. I think it almost certain that we shall be attacked in the morning, and we shall make the best fight we can.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 11, 1862-1 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Are any steps to be taken to increase the facilities for landing troops at Aquia Creek? The means are now excessively limited, and but few
