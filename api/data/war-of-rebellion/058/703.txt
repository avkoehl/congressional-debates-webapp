OXFORD, February 9, 1864.

General CHALMERS,

Panola:

Dispatch received. Have twice given orders in regard to transportation of First Mississippi Partisans, Obey the orders previously given or turn over you command to McCulloch and report to me for orders.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

OXFORD, February 9, 1864 - 5.40 p. m.

General CHALMERS,

Panola:

I will not come over to-morrow. Get Thrall's battery up and keep sharp lookout. I am of opinion the real move is in direction of Okolona and Meridian. Keep your force well in hand, so as to move at once if necessary. Watch at Belmont which with you battery. Send pickets to Burlingham. Your explanation is satisfactory.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

PANOLA, MISS.,

February 9, 1864 - 9.30 p. m.

Major-General FORREST,

Oxford:

If the real movement is on Okolona, how would it do for the two brigades here to attack the force in front and try to drive them into Memphis?

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

OXFORD, February 9, 1864.

General CHALMERS,

Panola:

Do not allow your command to engage a superior force. Fall back to the river and defend the crossing.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

MOBILE, February 10, 1864.

Lieutenant General L. POLK:

Can you spare two field batteries? Please send me Colonel Steedman's regiment to serve as heavy artillery. I require eight to ten teams for each brigade. The force you name seems to me fully as much as should be here.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.
