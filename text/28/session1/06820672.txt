APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April, 1844.
28th Gong 1st Sess.
The Tariff—Mr. Wethered.
H, of Reps.
dressed in smiles, and honeyed words flowing from
his lips, lo win his way to power. We have seen
him visiting States with the apparent design of in-
fluencing their elections . We have seen him de-
nouncing the pioneers of the West as robbers. We
have seen him execrating the foreigner who had fled
to our country for refuge. We have heard him in-
voking upon his country war, pestilence, and
famine, rather than the elevation of a military hero
(General Jackson) to the presidency. We have
seen him provoking his fellow-man to deadly com-
bat on the inglorious field, where men are bound by
the laws of honor to murder one another. W.e have
seen him on that field again and again. We have
heard the crack of Ins duelling pistol, aimed at the
breast of his brother man. We have seen his in-
terference in that cruel and bloody tragedy in which
Cilley fell. We have heard the sighs and moans
of the heart-broken widow,# and the screams and
shrieks of her orphan children; and we now see
him entered upon the contest for the highest office
in the gift of the world, under bonds to keep the
peace generally, and particularly with William R.
King. All these things the people have seen and
know; and knowing them, nothing on earth, or
above or below the earth, can induce them to intrust
themselves, their institutions, or their country, in
his hands. Never, sir; never. This country has
long been the favorite of an overruling and kind
Providence. Were all hope in the people gone—all
love of liberty and independence lost—still to that
Providence, ever watchful, ever generous and kind,
would I look for its special interposition to save us
and our beloved country from a calamity so disas-
trous, so destructive as the election of Mr. Clay;
and I have a deep and an abiding faith that I shall
not look in vain.
Nor*..—.Mr. Polk contrasts finely With Air. (/lay in tins
respect. For it he has been denounced as a coward. Mr.
Peyton, of Tennessee, m a speech delivered in the House
on the same subject, used, in reference to Mr. Polk, the fol-
lowing language: "The question would then seem very
naturally to arise, if Mr. Polk w as too much of a coward to
be Vice President, how fit is he to be the commander-in
chief of the army and navy ' These w ere Mr. Polk's quali-
fications ina militaiy point of view." It would seem that
no man whose hands are not reeking in human gore is now
thought by Mr. Clay's friends to be qualified for the office
of President.
SPEECH OF MR. WETHERED,
OF MARYLAND,
In the House af Representatives, Jfytril 24, 1814—On the
tarilt.
Mr. Chairman: In the remarks which 1 am about to
make, I do not intend to indulge m any fine spun theories,
hut shall leave all speculative opinions and abstractions to
gentlemen on the other side of the question, and confine my-
self to a matter-of-fact discussion of the subject under con-
sideration, believing that one fact is worth a thousand argu-
ments.
I must here say that 1 am glad to find the party who deny
that Congress has any constitutional pow or to protect the
labor ol the country, is narrowed down to a very few mem-
bers m this Congiess. If is not an undu^ assumption to
suppose that the distinguished gentlemen who flamed the
constitution, understood the powei * of that nstrument
quite as well as the doubting wiseacres of the present day.
Can any gentleman have doubts of the meaning ol the lan-
guage used b) Mr. Madison, the father of the constitution,
in the first general act of Congress—viz.
"Whereas it in necessary for the support of government,
for the dischaicc of the debts of the United States, and for
the encouragement and protection of manufactures, that du-
ties be laid cm ^ood;, -uau-s, and merchandise impoued.
Be it enacted," &c
This act was signed by President Washington the 4th of
July, 1789.
The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. OwevJ has declared he
intended to call things bv their right names. I intend, too,
to adopt this course, by giving this bill from the Committee
of Ways and Means its*true name, that is, a destructive
British bill—a bill to destroy the manufactuiers and
mechanics of our own country—to break up their
woikshops, and encourage those of Europe. It was in
character with the bill itself that the debate should ha>e
been opened by the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr. OwxnJ a
gentleman so lately a subject of Great Britain, and with all
his predilections in favor of the land of his birth. I do not
objectto the gentleman on account of his foreign birth, but
when the question arises, whether the workshops shell be
in England oi the United States. I think, as a representative
on this floor ol American interests, it would be more becom-
ing, und show more of American feeling, if he would lay
aside his foreign predilections, and sustain the land of his
adortion. I have no doubt, sir, if that gentleman were to
emigrate back to England, with his free trade speech in one
hand and this hill (a law) m the other, and m^ke his best
bow to Queen Victoria, and kneel before her, she would
strike him gently on the shoulder with a sword, arid greet
him with the words, rise "Knight, Sir Hobcrt Dale Owen,''
you have done my state some service. Ay, sir, if the hon-
orable committee who reported this bill were to go into that
country, they would have their rewajd, and be honoiedwith
the titles of Ea I McKav, Lord Dixon Lewis-', Duke Drom.
£0«i<\ Sir John Y>reJkr, &c England generally jewarfo
those who promote her interests, and they certainly have
some claim to consideration.
Sir, in framing this bill the committee (instead of sending
for the farmers, the manufacturers, and the mechanics of our
own country, to learn from them its practical efiects upon
their various interests) preferred writing to the British im-
porter, the British agent, and the British manufacturer; and
have actually, with the view of suxtaijJng their suicidal
measures, even appended to their report a table furnished by
a manufacturer of Manchester, showing the rates of duties
on various articles made by him !!! If this is not "going
down to Egypt for strength/' I would like to know what
would be.
I have examined this bill pretty thoroughly, and confess
that I am at a loss to say whether it is a free trade bill or
not. It seems to me that it might much more appropriately
be styled "a bill to encourage'Britisli interests." It is true
that iron, sugar, and spirits are accommodated with specific
duties somewhat protective. These baits have, no doubt,
been thrown out to catch the sweet gentlemen from Louisi-
ana, and the patriotic democratic members from Pennsylva-
nia, as some of these gentlemen, though willing to pull with
the committee, w ere soon diiven back by their constituents.
The purposes of these distinctions aie too glaring to be
mistaken, and the attempt to impose them upon this House
must certainly ia.il. The committee should have acted con-
sistently, and whilst breaking down nearly every import*
ant interest of the country, should have carried out their
principles. If the bait takes, the next attempt will no doubt
be to destroy the few remaining interests not now assailed.
It the enemies of domestic labor ever conquer, it must be
by creating divisions among- their opponents, their maxim
will be divide tt impera.
I wish the principles of this bill (which we are told was
framed for revenue) contrasted with the existing law, framed
for the same purpose, but with very pioper discrimina-
tions for protection. The latter was framed by a gentleman
from New York, [Mr. Fillmore,] chairman of tlie Committee
ofWaysai'd Means, not now amember of this House; he
was brought up a practicol mechanic, and consequently
knew the wants, the wishes, and the feelings of that \ alua-
able class of our community, and who framed his bill so as
to produce ample revenue, without inflicting injury on any
particular branch of the agricultural, manufacturing, or
mechanical interests of the country.
I find gentlemen getting up here and declaring that
commerce is injured by the operation of the present
tariff. If this be so, why do we find so many of the
merchants, who certainly understand their own inter-
ests, and know very well they cannot thrive except in
a prosperous community, among its warmest advocates?
No longer ago than at the time of the last Congress, my
colleague from Baltimore [Mr. Ki.xNf.ny] presented a
petition from 9,000 voters in his district, embracing the most
commercial and populous part of Baltimore, in lavor of a
pioi-ective tarirt, on which was found the signatures of al-
most every merchant in that city. Now, as long as this
class of our community are satisfied, I hope gentlemen will
show no false sympathy for them.
The i. onimittee of Way s and Means tell us that tliey pro-
pose to reduce the duties for the purpose of raising reve-
nue—that the revenue would be shoit; and add that 25 mil-
lions will be necessary to carry on the government. Now,
let us examine into the facts of this matter. Before the ink
with which this bill was written was dry, we hat e returns
from the custom houses ot the country, proving beyond all
doubt oi apprehension that abundant revenue would be de-
rived from the existing tariff, and that on this score no
change was necessary. In New York alone the receipts in
the months of January. February, and March, amounted to
$5,731,000; which cxcceds the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasury for the whole country.
That pretext thus unexpectedly oveithrown, we find the
advocates'of this pernicious bill resorting to other argu-
ments in favor of this ycleped free trade bill.
The gentleman from Alabama [Mr Payne] has asserted
that protection was an exclusive privilege to the owners of
the spindle, shuttle, and hammer. Now I assert that pro-
tection is necessary to every interest of the countiy—to the
laborer, the man of business, the mechanic, the fanner, and
even the cotton planter. Take away the duty on sugar, and
I leave southern gentlemen*to calculate what—tins valuable
interest having been destroyed—would be the amount of
cotton brought into market, in addition to what is already-
brought m, and the effect it would produce on prices.
The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Wuioh r] asseited that
the agricultmists weieinjured by the protective policy; that
the consumer paid additional prices foi all he used, and got
les« prices for all he raised.
Sir, 1 listened attentively to the remarks of the gentleman,
expecting linn to particularize some articles, the duties on
which were found to be oppressive to his constituents ; 'ind
after wandering a great deal through the broad field of aigu-
merit, lie quietly melted down into the article of salt, and
devoted a large pomon ot his horn in endeavoring to con-
vince the House that his constituents were oppressed bv the
very burdensome duty ot eight cents per bushel on salt. I
l>eg the gentleman wAl retain his bnny teais tor some other
event, as f will e.i<h:avor to remove the cause on this occa-
sion for any display of his sympathy. It is known that we
import about 6,330,000 bushels of salt for home consumption;
and it is estimated that we manufacture about the same
amount, <ay 6,350,000 bushels Our population is about
20.000,000, tins would make about one-third of a bushel to
each individual Now, if the price was increased to the
amount of the duty, it wouk'. impose the enormously oppres-
sive tax of 2 2-3 cents upon each of his constituents !! ! But
I will not admit that this is even the case, for it is well
\nown that nearly all the salt imported here comes in as
ballast, at a more nominal freight; this,, in connection with
domestic competition, keeps down the price. To show that
ihi< is the case, I read fiom a table compiled by the chair-
man of the Committee on Manufactures, [Mr*. Hudson,]
showing the
Puces and duty on vi.lt from 1795 to 1843, inclusive, per bushel,
ut Boston.

I ask the gentleman how it happens that two years ago,
when salt paid a duty of about 5£ cents, it sold for 28 cents
per bushel* and that, at this time, it pays a duty of 8 cents,
and sells for 23 cents per bushel? If he can discover any
particular influence which the duty has upon this article, it
is more than I have been able to do.
1 deny, sir, that the protective policy has the effect of
permanently raising prices upon most things manufactured
in this country; ana 1 need not leave this hall to prove this.
The shirt that I now wear cost 12£ cents per yard. It is
the product of our own soil, and the manufacture of our own
citizens. Before we had a protective tariff the same article
could not have been .imported from England at a less cost
than three times this price. The cloth of my coat cost $4
per yard, and I assert that cloth of equal value could not
have been purchased, before American skill and competi.
tion. by a protective tariff, were brought into requisition,
for $6 per yard. The pantaloons which I now wear cost
$1 50 per y aid, while such goods were readily sold for
$2 50before they were protected here. These boots cost
$3 50 per pair, and I will appeal to any gentleman who
hears me if as good could have been produced for $6 before
our bootmakers were protected. That hat cost $4; before
the manufacture of hats was protected the same article of
equal quality could not have been bought for less than $8.
I feel pioud in saying that these articles are all of Amer-
ican manufacture.
Mr Chairman, 1 hold in my left hand a pattern card of
French printed muslins at from 20 to 25 cents per yard, and
n my right hand an American article of similar style and
quality at from 12£ to 16 cents the yard! Verily the country
must be now afflicted with a most oppressive tariff upon the
consumei !
• Again, sir, this pattern card of American fabrics contain?
a great variety of sy les of woollen goods, used as cloaking
lor ladies' wear, and linings foi the cloaks of gentlemen.
This manufacture lias only been attempted in our country
within about two year*; past; before that time the articlo
was exclusively imported, and sold fiom $2 50 to $3; al-
leady has the enterprise and skill of our domestic manufac-
tuieis brought downthe prices, to $1 and $1 50 y er pard. Jn
confirmation of the correctness of the views I have en-
deavored to lay before you. I will, as concisely as possible,
submit the following additional evidences of the bappj ef-
fects produced by the operation of the existing tariff upon
various other articles, th© manufacture of which has been
introduced into the United States, as furnished to me by an
expeuenced merchant.
Relative value of sundry articles, made up f row actual sales m
1841, when the tariff ranged the louest, and in 1843, under
the present rates oj duties:

6b to 8^ c. 4^ to 6| c.

11 to 144 c. sl to 10* c
Cotton osnaburgs per yard,
5-4 brown shirtings "

6-1 " "
The prices of bleachcd goods have changed in the samp
ratio. Domestic prints (staple styles) 12^ to 18 c.—8£ to 1
c. do cloths and cassimeres and sattinets reduced not less
than 33£ per cent.
The effect of the tariff on calicoes or prints is probably as
greptas any other article. During the year 1840, large
quantities of British prints were imported that cost 22 to 28
cents per yard; in 1843, prints of as good quality were pro-
duced in this country as low as 15 cents per yard, which en-
tirely excluded British prints from our markets.
YFioin 1834 to 1843, the des^ was declining under the opei-
ation of the compromise act The amount of duty must
depend upon the price The above is only an estimate of
the duty, though probably not far from the truth,
