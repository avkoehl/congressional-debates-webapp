full retreat, and my sabers are charging them. Brigadier-General George is in our hands, and a number of other prisoners. Losses on both sides not yet ascertained. There are no troops at Germantown. We are short of ammunition. Will report further soon. The line is all right east.

Colonel, Commanding.

COLLIERVILLE, November 3, 1863-8.30 p.m.

The enemy have been driven across the Coldwater. The rout is complete. At the Coldwater they mad a stand with artillery. Firing has ceased. Colonel Mizner has assumed command of the Second Brigade, and has issued orders to Colonel McCrillis which conflict with my plans. Impossible to handle the First Brigade, owing to Colonel Mizner's rank. I think there is another column, which passed through Salem; am not certain, though, and hardly think it prudent to leave the road too far in pursuit with the force at my command. My advance is now near Quinn and Jackson's Mill, and I leave here as soon as the infantry comes up.

EDWARD HATCH,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

Major-General HURLBUT.

CHULLAHOMA, November 4, 1863.

The enemy's retreat, since leaving Coldwater, has been a rout. Retreating so rapidly, I have captured but few prisoners. The enemy have many killed and wounded lying along the line of retreat. Chalmers' force engaged, so far as ascertained, are McCulloch's Second Missouri Regiment, Jackson's old regiment [First [Seventh] Tennessee], George's Mississippi, McGuirk's Mississippi, Slemons' Second Arkansas, Bart's [?] Mississippi, Twelfth Tennessee, Chalmers' Battalion, two 6-pounder guns, one rifle, three small caliber.

I shall be on the road to-morrow.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD HATCH,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major-General HURLBUT.
