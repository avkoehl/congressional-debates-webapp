It is estimated, that of former appiopnations,
tlieie will lcmam unexpended at the close of this
year the sum of $8,002,925 13
Of this amount, it is supposed that only
$3,141,964 27 will be íequned to accomplish the
objects intended by the cutient appropnations—
leaving tht sum of $939,742 9S, applicable aftti-
wuds uudti pt irnaiitut appiopnations, and that
of $1,523,308 79 to bt applied 111 aid of the ap
propnations ior the tnsumc; yi ai, without reaji
pi opnation— is will be seen in the estimates whe n
submitted, and the balaiK e of $337,909 14, which
has not been rcquned at all, or seasonably, foi
the objects contemplated in its appiopnation,and
will, theieforc, be earned to the suiplus fund In
tho examination of this result, as to outstanding
appiopnations, it should be noticed, that one
small amount of unclaimed interest on the public
debt, and auothti of unfundtd dtbt, though
chargeable on tht Treasuiy, aie not included
Embiacmg those and tho amount applicable af
terwaids to peimanent appiopnations, theie
would not be money enough m the Treasury to
pay, at once, eveiy claim outstanding But, ex-
cluding them, it will be seen that the effective,
unexpended funds on the 1st of January, 1835,
will be $5,586,231 34, to meet what will be re-
quired for the lemammg and unexpended appro-
priations, being $5,141,964 27,01, in other woids,
that our available means then on hand to discharge
all the old and existing claims on the Tieasuiy,
with the exceptions befoie nomtd, will be about
$444.,268 07 moie than their actual amount
The next subject dése, vmg consideration is the
condition of
2   The Pubhc Debt
All thefoui and a half pei cents, outstanding at
the commencement of tht pies nt yeai, have been
redeemed, except the sum of $443 25 Money
sufficient to meet tht whole balance was placed in
the United States Bank and its branches, as com-
missioner of loans, in May last, and that poition
not ytt paid to the holders, of the debt still íemains
in these dtpositones A part of tht fivt pei tent
stotk, citcUtd in Maich, \ D 1821, amounting
to $4,712,000 29, was all of the $123,000,000 of
debt existing in A D 1816, and of the subsequent
additions to it which weie leftto be lcdeemed It
did not become payable till the 1st of January,
1835, but as theie was sufficient money in the
Titasury foi the puipose, and it having been eon-
sidticd beneficial to the public to save, as fai as
piacticable, all the acciuing interest, early in
July last, agents weie employed by this Depait-
ment to pinchase, at pai, if possible, the whole
of tht k mauling dtbt Bawcen that tune and the
30th ultimo, the Depaitmeit had succeeded 111
lcdccmmg about$491,258 35of it, and additional
pinchases ait tonstantly making In October
list, the undeisijned gave notice that the whole
of this debt unredeemed aftci th" 1st of Januuy
next would cease to beai intcicst, and would be
piomptly paid, aftci that d ite, on application to
the commiss om is of loans 111 the several States
Under authonty iiom the eommissiontis of the
sinking fund, tins Dtpaitment has since placed
and made amngements to place, seasonably, 111
those offices ample funds foi the above puipose
Thus, befoie the close of the ycai, the whole
will either be paid, 01 money provided to pay it
—and the United States will present that happy,
and probably, in modtrn times, unpieeedented
spectacle, of a people substantially fiee from the
smallest poi tion of a public debt
Considenng these facts, it was deemed pioper
to chaige the whole amount of the ¡emaming
debt to the expenditures of the present yeai In-
terest on all not paid bifoie the 30th ult mo has
been tomputtd till the 1st of Januaiy next, the
time being so shoit, and the account foi the pay-
ment of the public debt, dunng the year, will
then stand as follows
All the disbuisements on account of the public
debt, dunng the yeai  1834, will  be, as  before
shown     ...................$6,161,017 46
Of which there will have been ap-
plied to pnncipal, $5,964,774 93
And to inttiest ...       196,242 53
The stocks, which will have been redeemed by
the application of this sum dunng the year, aie—
Of the residue of the exchanged il/, percent
stock, issued undei the act of the 26th of May,
1824......................$1,252,625 90
Tho  residue   of the  5   per cent
stock, issued under the act of
the 3d of Mai eh, 1821.....4,712,060 29
Cei tain poitions of unfunded debt,                38 74
Treasuiy notes................                50 00
Making m all the principal before-named
Theie is an unfunded debt of about.. $37,733 05
Consisting of claims registcied prior
to 1798, for services and supplies
during the rtvolutionaiv war, of
about ...............$27,437 96
Treasury    notes    issued
dunng the last war  . .     5,975 00
And Mississippi stock ..     4,320 09
Nothing has been paid on any of these during
the present year, except $88 74, but should the
certificates be ever piesented, which is not very
pi obable as to many of them, the means undoubt-
edly will always exist for their payment at this
Department
