CINCINNATI, OHIO, June 17, 1863.

(Received 10.20 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

As you direct, I will send no troops to Pittsburg. The Twenty-seventh New Jersey, whose time expires on the 19th instant, have already left for home. I have authorized General Brooks to detain them at Pittsburg if he thinks best, they having offered their services to the President for this emergency.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

Lee seems to be moving up to the north, with a view to the invasion of Pennsylvania and Ohio, he holds the Shenandoah Valley, and as far west as Cumberland and as far as Chambersburg, with cavalry, and we still hold Harper's Ferry. I think the main body of his force is still between the Blue Ridge and Bull Mountains. Indications are that Hooker is followed him, and I hope he will make a successful attack on his rear. I have sent out those two expeditions of which I have already informed you, and am very much inclined to follow them with all my available amount of force into East Tennessee, say, to the extent of 5,00 or 6,00 men. What is your opinion? Will it be of service to you if the move is made?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, June 17, 1863 - 12 m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Dispatches received. I think favorably of the proposed movement; it will help me very much. Do you mean to take from Hartsuff; and, if so, how much? Also, when, from whence, and on what point will you move?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
