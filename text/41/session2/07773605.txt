withoat ioritin* sealed proposals for tho same from
the Ktvltr trade, to be opened iu tho presence of
tlie serriee naval officer in port, and the consul,
commercial or consular agent, if there be one, who
shall accord the contract to the lowest bidder.
Mr. SCOF1ELD. I make the point that this
ia new legislation, and therefore not in order in
an appropriation bill. I am under the impres-
sion that the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr.
Mayxard] reserved all points of order on this
hill.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has no knowl-
edge of that fact.
Mr. MAYNARD. Snch is my impression.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I have
no recollection of any point of order being
reserved
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is not dis-
tinctly informed whether the gentleman from
Tennessee or any other gentleman reserved the
right to raise points of order with reference to
the bill. If the right was reserved the Chair
is of opinion that this section is independent
legislation and cannot be considered. If the
right was not reserved, then it is too late to
raise the question of order now.
Mr. SCO FIELD. It is some time since this
bill was referred to the Committee of the
Whole, bat my impression is that the gentleman
from Tennessee reserved points of order, and
that I believe is the gentleman's own recollec-
tion.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. This is
the first I have heard of it.
Mr. MAYNARD. My recollection is in ac-
cordance with what has been stated by the gen -
tie man from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Scofield.]
Mr. SARGENT. I recollect that the gen-
tleman from Tennessee reserved the right to
make points of order.
Mr. DAWES. I would inquire of the Chair
if there is any record of that fact?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair accepts the
statement of the gentleman from California
[Mr. Sakgej>"t] and other gentlemen, that the
right to raise the objection was reserved. The
Chair rules that this section is independent
legislation, and cannot be considered a part of
this bill.
The section accordingly was stricken out,
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I move
that the committee rise and report the bill to
the House with amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and Mr.
Scofield having taken the chair as Speaker
pro tempore, Mr. Ei-dridge reported that the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, according to order of the House, had
had uuder consideration the Union generally,
and particularly the special order, House bill
No. 1533, making appropriations for the naval
service for the fiscal year ending 30th June,
1871, and had directed him to report back the
bill with sundry amendments.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I demand
the previous question on the passage of the
bill and amendments.
Mr. COX. I hope that the final passage of
the bill will bepostponed till to-morrow.
Mr. ARCHER. Let us adjourn.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Let us windup
the bill to-night.
The previous question was seconded and
the main question ordered, which was first on
concurring in the amendments reported from
the Committee of the Whole.
Mr. LYNCH. Is it proposed that they shall
be concurred in in the gross ?
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I ask
that they shall all be considered as concurred
in, unless a separate vote is asked on any of
them.
The amendments were concurred in.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to be
engrossed and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin, moved to
reconsider the vote by wtych the bill was
passed; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
^ And then, on motion of Mr. COX, (at ten
o'clock p. m.,) the House adjourned.

Mr. POMEROY. I have received and am
charged with the presentation of a memorial,
signed by some three hundred eftifcens of the
State of Rhode Island, in which they represent
that there are inequalities among white male
citizens of the United States resident in that
State, sustained by the constitution and laws
of the State, in reference to the right to vote.
They represent that the two recent amendments
to the Constitution of the United States, the
fourteenth and the fifteenth, ought to be so
administered as to protect them; They repre-
sent that the constitution and laws of the State
of Rhode Island require that persons of foreign
birth, although naturalized citizens of the Uni-
ted States, shall own real estate to the amount
of some $150 or else they shall not vote. This
is clearly a Very obnoxious pr6vision, as I
think. I have for many /pairs insisted that
there should be no inequalities amortg citizens;
among male citizens especially, in the right to
â€¢vote. I carinot see, however, that this pro-
vision of the constitution and laws of the State
of Rhode Island contravenes the amendments
tothe Constitution of the United States. There
is only one clause in those amendments which
affects the question in any way, and that is the
second section of the fourteenth amendment,
under which the State of Rhode Island will
necessarily suffer if she persists in practicing
this inequality among male citizens, and that
is in regard to the basis of representation.
That section of the fourteenth amendment
provides:
â€¢ "When the right to voto at any election for the
ehoioe of electors for President and Vice President
of the United States, Representatives in Congress,
the executive and judicial officers of a State, or tho
members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any
of the male inhabitants Of suoh State being twenty-
