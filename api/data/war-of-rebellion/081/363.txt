Major-General

CITY POINT, June 23, 1864-10.15 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I have requested Colonel Biggs to suggest a modification of the schedule time of mail-boats,to secure a connection between your headquarters and Fort Monroe. One daily line can perform the mail service for both armies, and I will try to make it satisfactory to you. The Eighteenth Corps have their mail put up in Washington same as the Army of the Potomac. Should you so order for you headquarters and the Tenth Corps there could be no break in the connection. Until some arrangements are made the mail-boat shall wait for your mails at Fort Monroe or a special shall be put on.
