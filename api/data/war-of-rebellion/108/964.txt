Lieutenant-Colonel PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: A reliable scout from my old brigade has just reported to me that he was sent to the front at 10.30 last night, and made an effort to penetrate the enemy's picket-lines, but failed because their line was strong and ran to the river-bank. He approached, however, very near to the enemy in the Doswell field, and heard distinctly the opening of boxes; he supposes boxes containing hard bread. He also heard wagons approaching and retiring; also the movement of artillery, which he could plainly distinguish from the rumbling of wagons. The artillery was moving from him up the river. He heard vehicles, he could not tell whether artillery or wagons, crossing a bridge a considerable distance up the river. There was a great deal of talk and commotion in their lines, and he was satisfied the enemy was moving, and is positive the movement is not down the river on this side--that is, to our right. He could hear no commands. I have sent Colonel Lilley, who has charge of my skirmish line and vedettes, to endeavor to ascertain what is going on, and will report as soon as I hear from him, if there is anything of importance.

I am, Colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. GORDON,

Major-General.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

At the time that the First and Second Battalions Florida Troops stopped in Petersburg, the enemy were threatening from Cobb's; and my troops having been drawn from me, I deemed it absolutely necessary to detain them. They have since gone forward.
