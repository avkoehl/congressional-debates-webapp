HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 11, 1865-3.30 p. m.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The 200 men from Bragg's brigade who are on picket are a detail from a regiment. If practicable I think they had better join it.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 11, 1865-4 p. m.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I understand from General Crawford that the 200 men on picket from General Bragg's brigade are all new men. On that account

I think they had better be left here.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 11, 1865-5.20 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

It is possible that Bragg's brigade may not return. The men on picket and the recruits under Major Hoyt, Seventh Wisconsin Volunteers, and Captain Morgan, provost-marshal of the division, should follow the command, unless they belong to, and of themselves form, one regiment, none of whose members have gone to. In such case they may be retained, otherwise they should be sent forward.

By command of Major-General Meade:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 11, 1865-5.40 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

A staff officer of General Crawford reports the men left behind by Bragg as belonging to different regiments. They should, therefore, go forward. Please order them at once. General Bragg has been directed to order back a regiment or more, sufficient to cover his surplus-over 1,200 men.

By command of Major-General Meade:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
