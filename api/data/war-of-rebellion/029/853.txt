division. This having been accomplished by 9 o'clock at night, I remained in line of battle until nearly 7 o'clock on the morning of the 31st. At that time I again received orders from division commander to wheel my command to the right, keeping the right connected with General Cheatham's left. General Cheatham's division not moving at same moment, I found if I attempted to keep with his line I should become separated from the division, then advancing. General Wood, about this time, having been ordered to my right by Lieutenant-General Hardee, and General Cheatham having commenced to move up, I continued my move, gaining ground slightly to the left. About 7.30 o'clock, and before I had moved more than 700 yards, I received word from Colonel [B. J.] Hill that my right had commenced to engage the enemy in a grove of cedars near the old Franklin dirt road. I did not believe at first that the enemy could be so near us, having understood that we were supporting General McCown. Riding to the place, I was received by a volley from the enemy, resulting in the severe wounding of my orderly [Mike Connell]. In a few moments my entire line advanced across the Franklin dirt road, entered this cedar brake, and engaged the enemy all along the line. In a very short time, by the aid of Captain [J. H.] Calvert's battery, we succeeded in driving the enemy out of the cedars in great confusion. Here Major Carlton, Captain Dixon, and Lieut. William H. Pearce, Fifteenth Arkansas Regiment, were wounded while gallantly leading their men.

Following them closely as we could, we encountered them again in a woods pasture immediately in our front, in direction of Wilkinson Cross-Roads pike. After a few moments fighting, we succeeded in breaking their lines, and again they fell back in much confusion. From this position, after having formed my line, I advanced in a line parallel to Wilkinson pike, General Wood on my right and General Johnson on my left en echelon, with the exception of the Seventeenth Tennessee Regiment [which was in advance] of his [Johnson's] brigade. Advancing through the pasture, the enemy were seen posted across an open field near one of their hospitals and only a few hundred yards of the pike. My brigade was obliged to move across this open field with the enemy's artillery and infantry playing upon them. This they did most gallantly. causing the enemy to fall back across the pike under heavy undergrowth of cedars. Getting possession at this place of four or five ordnance wagons, which were sent to the rear, I again moved on, but did not proceed far when the enemy's batteries, posted across a corn-field on the right of the pike, commenced playing fearfully upon my ranks. Here Captain [Charles P.] Moore, Second Tennessee, was killed, and many other officers of that regiment. [See Colonel [W. D.] Robinson's report.*]

The battery was so placed, by moving straight forward my line would have been enfiladed. To prevent this, my brigade was wheeled to the right. At this time, Captain Hotchkiss sending me word that he had three batteries that required supporting, I left two of my smallest regiments and moved the rest farther to the left, for the purpose of trying to move the enemy's batteries. The Fifth Confederate here first engaged the infantry supporting these batteries, and in a few moments [the First Arkansas arriving in position] their infantry gave way and their batteries changed their position, with the exception of four guns that fell into the hands of the Fifth Confederate and First Arkansas, and in eagerness of pursuit were passed over.

From this place I moved on with my brigade, the regiments left in
