THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 22.
The only portion which goes to the credit side of
that account, is that which is paid in New York.
Then the gentleman says the New York mer-
chants charge their customers in their bills with
all-the postage. As a general proposition, I deny-
that statement. There are instances, doubtless,
where merchants do charge'postage, in their ac-
counts. I have heard of such things; but the in-
stances, I am confident, are rare. They do not
constitute the general rule. Even if the postages
were put into the account by the New York mer-
chants, it proves nothing. Those who transact
business with New'York, would take that charge in-
to consideration with many others, making up the
aggregate cost of production of their commodities.
We might as well argue that we pay the postage of
other sections because we buy what they produce.
Mr. BARKSDALE. Allow me to make a
suggestion.
Mr. SICKLES. I will when my five minutes
are through.
Mr. Chairman, one of my colleagues [Mr.
Russell] has taken the pains to make out an
exact statement of the expenditures and receipts
for postage in the northern and southern States,
by way of comparison. This statement ought
to satisfy gentlemen of the South that they have
the best of the copartnership so far as postal fa-
cilities to .the whole country are concerned; the
comparison does not place them in a very envia-
ble position; we paying nearly all the revenue
into the Department for their benefit. While they
talk of increasing postages and making the De-
partment self-sustaining, we, of course, will have
to double our contributions.
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, 1 did not ex-
pect to take part in this debate, for the simple
reason that we spend altogether too much time in
talking, and decidedly too little in advancing the
business of the country. Cut, sir, the remarks
of th'e gentleman from Mississippi, [Mr. Barks-
dale,] made on this floor a few days since, to
the elrect that no State in this Union collected
postal revenue sufficient to pay the postal ex-
penses within her limits, and as my recollection
was at variance with that of the gentleman from
Mississippi, I was led to an examination of the
report of the Postmaster General, and found the
gentleman was in error. And, sir, as the exam-
ination exhibited a very novel state of things not
generally understood, as 1 believe, I have taken
the trouble to prepare the table referred to by my
colleague, and to which J most earnestly call the
attention of this House and of the whole counti y.
Particularly do I call the attention of southern
gentlemen to this exhibit, with a view of allowing
them the great wrong that would be inflicted upon
us of the North by doubling the present ra<es of
postage, and to assure them that sueh o propor-
tion will never be entertained by the northern
States for a moment. For the present we are con-
tent with the present rates, notwithstanding the
fact that we pay largely in excess <f onr juir propor-
tion of the postal expenses of the Post Ojjicc Depart-
ment over that >of the southern States. But, sir,
when a change in the present, rates of postage is
made, my word for it, it will be to leduce, in
place of to increase, the present rates. Having
sai4 this much, 1 send to the Clerk's desk the ta-
bles of revenue, expenditures, and deficiencies of
the Post-Office Department in the northern and
in the southern Statks for the year 185$, and 1
trust the.exhibit will have the effect to stifle fur-
ther efforts on the part of the friends of a self-
sustaining Post Oifice Department to an mcioase
of the present rates of postage:

Mr. Chairman, it has been denied, over and
over again, hy gentlemen on this floor, that New
York is self-austaimng in postages. I assort,
upon official data, that, she is stlj-svstnining. The
accompanying tables prove my premises, and I
repeat they arc compiled from the report of the
Postmaster General.
Now, sir, it is \vith pride and great pleasure
that 1 call the attention of this committee to the
proud position of the Empire State m this con-
nection. Sir, New York alone pays $1,154,1 li 37
revenue into the Treasury from postal receipts; \
whereas tlrti entire southern States only pay ,
$1,760,502; thus showing that New York alone !
pays about sixty por cent, as much revenue into j
the Post Office Department as the entire South, i
New Yotk and Massachusetts, or New Yoik and :
Pennsylvania, paying as much or nioro than the [
combined South. This showing ought to satisfy '
the fi tends of a self-sustaining Post Office De- 1
paifment that it would be unjust and unfair to !
the North, unequal and illiberal in every sense, !
and that the people of the North will never eon- \
sent to an increase in the rates of postage. They \
arc for progress; and when a change is effected, j
it will be to reduce in place of to increase the pres- !
cnt rates. j
Mr. FLORENCE. I move to amend the !
•amendment, by striking out any word. I have |
had  |
Mr. LETCHER. Will the Chair announce !
the amendment of the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania?
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania will indicate what word he proposes to I
strike out. :
Mr. FLORENCE. I move a pro forma amend- !
ment, to strike out any word; and I propose to '
speak to the amendment. [Laughter.]
Mr. MORGAN. I rise to a question of order.
The gentleman moves to amend, by striking out
" any word." There are no such words in the j
bill. j
Mr. FLORENCE. Well, sir, the erudition of |
the gentleman is most wonderful; and I am much i
obliged to him for the information. However, I |
will accppt the suggestion of a gentleman near
raejto move to strike out the word " more;'* and
then I shall have a little more to say th#n I have
already said. Let us end this matter of rivalry
between gentlemen m New York and gentlemen
out of New York; and let us go back to the
amendment of the gentleman from Virginia, and
see how that will work. It is confessed here that
the Post Office Department is not self-sustaining*,
and it is confessed, on all sides, that to perform
all the services of that Department, a larger ap-
propriation will be needed than is contained in
this appropriation bill. If gentlemen will look at
the effect of trhe proposition of the gentleman
from Virginia, they, perhaps, will notbe so ready
to support it; especially those gentlemen who de-
sire a continuance of the lines from New York or
Portland to New Orleans, and of ail these great
overland routes which now do so much service
to the country. If the amendment is adopted, its
effect must be to lessen the scrvicc; and X appre-
hend it would reduce the service between Wash-
ington and New York to three times a week.
That will be the effect of it. I ask gentlemen to
look at it seriously; and ask themselves, if the
Postmaster General is confined to the amount spe-
cially appropriated in the bill, and that amount
is not sufficient for the service, whether, as legis-
lators, desiring to promote the services of the
Post Office Department, they are willing to with-
diaw these mail facilities now enjoyed all over
the land, and to do it by adopting the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Virginia?
I do not desire to say.anything in regard to the
ocean mail service; yet, if a little of that might
be distributed, and a little of it given to Philadel-
phia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Charleston, and New
Orleans, it ..would add elasticity and courage to
their citizens, and increase the material and arti-
ficial advantages which they have in the com-
mercial relations of the country. I am anticipat-
ing a little the time when we shall have the ocean
mail steam appropnation bill before us; and when
it comes before us, I trust we will exercise an en-
lightened intelligence, and adopt a plan which will
distribute that service all over the Union, and not
confine it to Nevf York, which lias so many na-
tural, commercial, and artificial advantages.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. BRANCH. I am opposed to the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, because
I am m favor of the amendment of the gentleman
fiom Virginia, and shall oppose anything which
will tend to deftat it. I think that the debate has
taken a wider range than is justified by the amend-
ment of my friend from Virginia. Gentlemen
have discussed it as if it were a proposition to
curtail the postal services of the country. There
is not any such thing in the amendment, accord-
ing ro my understanding of it. The amendment
is simply a proposition that the Postmaster Gen-
eral shall not expend in the year more than is
appropriated by Congress. It is not a question
as to whether the postal services shall be curtailed,
but whether the Postmaster General, like all the
other Executive officei s of this Government, shall
be subject to law, or shall he above the law.. If
gentlemen think that the amount appropriated by
this bill is not sufficient to furnish all the postal
service to the country which it needs, I respect-
fully suhmit to them that the proper mode to pro-
ceed is to propose to increase the amount appro-
priated by the hill. If they think that $3,800,000
is insufficient for this Department to draw from
the public Treasury, let them move to increase
that amount. If their object is to increase the
postal facilities, let them increase the amount ap-
propriated for postal facilities.
But I submit to the committee that the amend-
ment proposed by the gentleman from Virginia
does not raise that question. It is simply a ques-
tion as to whether the Postmaster General shall
be confined to law, or whether the Treasury of
the United States shall be placed at his disposal.
Why, sir, suppose any gentleman should pro-
pose here to allow the Secretary of War, the Sec-
retary of the Navy, or any other Executive officer
of this Government, to spend money ad libitum;
suppose it was proposed to let the President of
the United States himself, who is elected by the
people, and responsible to them, spend money at
his discretion, out of the public Treasury: how
many voices would be raised in favor of it? I un-
dertake to say, not one. But here is a proposition
