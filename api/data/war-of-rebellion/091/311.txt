Major C. H. RAYMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I received information this morning from a Union man, Mr. Stabler, living at Sunday Spring, that a party of rebels, fifty men strong, robbed the store at that place this morning at 1 o'clock. They crossed the Potomac the night of the 5th above the Monocacy. The regiment has crossed the river, and I have no force here to follow them, my company being only sufficient to guard the regimental property at this place.
