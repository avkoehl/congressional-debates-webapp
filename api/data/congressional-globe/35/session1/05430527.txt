Estimate:

indefinite, including all private bills  3,565,635 87
$68,000,000 00
Thus we find that the expenditures for the
year ending June 30, 1859, amount to the sum of
§68,000,00(5, instead of $92,000,000, as estimated
by the gentleman from Ohio. If the wishes of the
President and Cabinet, and a large majority of the
Democratic members of Congress, could have pre-
vailed, the expenditures would have fallen below
this sum. The result, however, demonstrates
most conclusively that the conjectural estimates
of the gentleman from Ohio were not within mil-
lions of the true amount, and should cause the
people to distrust all theoretical and imaginative
calculations on subjects of so much importance
to their welfare.
And, in this connecton, permit me to express
my cordial approval of the sentiments embodied
by the President in his annual message, in which
he declares that—
" An overflowing Treasury has led to habits of prodigal-
ity and extravagance in our legislation. It has induced
Congress to make large appropriations to objects for winch
they never would have provided had it been necessary to
raise the amount of revenue required to meet them by
increased taxation or by loans. We are now compelled to
pause in our career, and to scrutniKie our expenditure with
the utmost vigilance ; andin perfoiming this duty, 1 pledge
my cooperation to the extent of my constitutional compe-
tency.
It ought to be observed at the same time that true pub-
lic economy does not consist in withholding the means ne-
cessary to accomplish important national objects intrusted
to us by the Constitution, and especially such as may be
necessary for the common defense. In the present crisis
of the country it is our duty to confine our appropriations
to objects of this character, unless in cases where justice
to individuals may demand a different course. In all cases
care ought to be taken that the money granted by Congress
shall be faithfully and economically applied.
" Under the Federal Constitution,i every bill which shall
have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate,
shall, before it becomes a law,' be approved and signed by
the President; and, if not approved,' he shall return it with
his objections to that House m which it originated.' In order
to perforin this high and responsible duty, sufficient tune
must be allowed the President to read and examine every
bill presented to him for approval. Unless this be afforded,
the Constitution becomes* a dead letter in this particular;
and even worse, it becomes a means of deception. Our
constituents, seeing the President's approval and signature
attached to each act of Congress, are induced to believe that
he has actually performed this duty, when, in truth, noth-
ing is. m manv cases, more unfounded.
" From theVactlce of Congress, such an examination of
each bill as the Constitution requires has been rendered im-
possible. The most important business of each session is
generally crowded into its last hours, and the alternative
presented to the President is either to violate the constitu-
tional duty which he ow es to the people, and approve bills
which, foi want of time, it is impossible he should have ex-
amined, or, by his refusal to do this, subject the country and
individuals to gieat loss and inconvenience.
" Besides, a piaotiro has grown up of late years to legis-
late in appropriation bills at the la«t hour of the session on
new and important subjects. This practice constrains the
President cither to suffer measures to become laws which he
does not approve, or to incui the risk of stopping the wheels
of the Government by vetoing an appropriation bill. Form-
erly, such bills were confined to specific appropriations for
carrying into effect existing laws and the well-established
policy of the country, and little time was then required by
the President for their examination."
Conservative men of all parties have expressed
their approbation of these sentiments, and it
should be cause of gratulation with all that the
President has adhered to them with so much firm-
ness and courage. His course at this session has
saved millions of dollars that would have been
uselessly expended, it has given to the country
cleaner appropriation bills than we have hereto-
fore had during my service in Congress. He has
in this respect inaugurated a policy that will in-
sure results important to sound legislation, and
of lasting benefit to the people. It is a practical
measure, well calculated to bring about a much-
needed economy in public expenditures. For it
he deserves the thanks of the people, and they will
be gratefully accorded.
So true a friend to economy has the President
shown himself, and so anxious is he to secure it
in his administration of the Government, that he
has again, this day, in a special message, endeav-
ored to impress upon Congress his views on this
interesting subject. Who can fail to indorse these
sentiments in his special message? Who can
hesitate to accord to them his entire approval?
<( Adversity teaches useful lessons to nations as well as
individuals. The habit of extravagant expenditures, fos-
tered by a large surplus in the Treasury, must now be cor-
rected, or the country will be involved in serious financial
difficulties.
u Under any form of government extravagance in ex-
penditure must be the natural consequence when those who
authorize the expenditure feel no refponsibilty in providing
the means of payment. Such had been for a number of
years our condition previously to the late monetary revul-
sion m the countiy. Foitunately, at least for the cause of
public economy, the case is now reversed; and to the ox-
tent of the' appropriations, whatever these may be, in-
graited on the different appropriation bilH, as well as those
made by private hills, over and above the estimates of the
different Departments, it will be necessary for Congress to
provide the means of payment before their adjournment.
Without tins, the Treasury will be exhausted before the
1st of Januarj,and the public credit will he seriously im-
paired. This disgrace must not fall upon the country."
The gentleman, then, charges that the expend-
itures now are extravagant beyond all precedent,
and that they are wholly inexcusable upon any
fair giound. Before proceeding to reply to the
views which he presents m this part of his argu-
ment, 1 desire to call attention to some historical
facts that are important m this connection, and
which are indispensable to a corrcct judgment
upon the issues he has tendered.
And first, as to the number of States and or-
ganized Territories, and their area, in 1815; and
the number of States and Territories, and their
area, in 1858. At the former period we had eigh-
teen States, covering an area of 504,412 square
miles, and five organized-Territories, (exclusive
of the District of Columbia,) covering an area of
of 254,452 square miles. In 1858 we have thirty-
two States, covering an area of 1,602,000 square
miles, six organized Territories, (exclusive of
the District of Columbia,) covering an area of
1,401,000 square miles. Besides this, we have the
Mesilla valley, embracing 78,000 square miies,
and Indian Territory, embracing 187,000 square
miles. In 1815, therefore, the States and Territo-
ries covered 759.864 square miles, while in 1858
they cover 3,268,000 square miles, an area four
times and one third larger now than in 1815.
In 1815 the strength of our Army was 10,000
men, while in 1858 its strength is 17,984 men.
In 1815 the Navy comprised 968 officers, of all
grades, (including marines.) In 1858 the officers
had increased to 1,336. In 1815 the number of
men cannot be ascertained, but from the best evi-
dence that can be obtained, the number was about
5,370. Now the number is 8,500. In 1816 we
had 52 vessels, carrying 1,119 ^uns;2£ vessels
with no armament; 4 bombs, and 11 gun-boats—
making 92. In 1858 we have 10 ships-of-the-hne,
carrying 872guns; 10 frigates carrying 500 guns;
21 sloops-of-war, carrying 426 guns; 3 brigs, car-
rying 16 guns; 1 schooner, carrying 3 guns; 8
screw steamers of the first class, carrying 268
guns; 6 of the second class, carrying 89 guns; 2
of the third class, carrying 11 guns; 3 side-wheel
steamers of the firstclass, carrying 24 guns; 1 of
the second class, carrying 6 guns; 2 of the third
class, carrying 6 guns—making a total of 2,221
guns. Besides these there aie two tenders foi the
screw-steamers, and one tender for the side-wheel
steamers, and five permanent store and receiving
ships.
Captain Wright, of the .engineer department,
to whom I applied for information on the subject
of fortifications, says:
<• I am not aware of any recoils m this office giving the
i number of fortifications in the United States in 131o, and
j believe it would be a work of much labor and tune to n-oer-
, ram with eenatnty vvli.u the number was. Manv oi the
' work-* bearing the name offoits were mwrely unpiovi^ed
{ field woiks or batteries; while othets, like (hose on St.tten
} Island, for the defense of the entrance to tire harbor of New
; York, were State works.*5
As to the number of fortifications in 1858, Cap-
tain Wright says:
" There are at the present time, under the charge of the
engineer department, fifty-six distinct permanent works of
fortifications on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, and
on the northern lake frontier, which are either completed
or m course of construction. In addition to these, appro-
priations were made at the last regular session of Congress
for ten additional works, on which little or nothing lias been
done toward the commencement."
The number of light-house^ and light vessels
prior to 1815 was 49. In 1858 lights of all kinds,
including beacon lights and light-vessels, existing
and authorized to be built, number 602. About
33 have not been finished, but are in the course of
construction.
In 1815 we had99 collectors of the revenue,and
77 surveyors, and ifi 1821 we had 631 inferior of-
ficers in the revenue service. In 1858 the number
of collectors is 116, and the number of surveyors
110—making 226. The number of inferior officers
employed in the collection of the revenue is
3,088.
The numberof land offices in 1815 was 19. The
number in 1858 is 86.
The expenditure for the Indian service in 1815
amounted to gill,750. The same service now
requires an expenditure of $4,158,430 39.
In 1815 the numberof pensioners was estimated
at- 1,400, and the amount paid to them was
$98,000. At this time the number has increased
to 13,186, and $1,365,717 54 is now required for
their payment.
These facts, thus presented, clearly show the
condition and extent of our territory, the larger
portion of which has been acquired since 1815,
the period at which the gentleman sums up the
annual expenditures on the third page of his
speech. Since that time we have acquired the
Floridas, Texas, New Mexico, and California,
and the Gadsden purchase. Under these circum-
stances, no fair or just comparison in regard to the
expenditures can be instituted between the years
1815 and 1858. It would be about as fair and wise
to institute a comparison between the expendi-
tures of a child and those of the full-grown man.
The gentleman is a recognized leader of his
party, and to this position he is fairly entitled by
his intelligence and character. He was a mem-
ber of the last Congress, and I desire, as he is
now preaching economy, to call his attention to
some of the legislation of that Congress, in which
he participated, and for which he and hispajty,
so far as the House is concerned, are responsible,
to a great extent at least.
The submarine telegraph bill appropriated
$70,000 per annum to that scheme until the inter-
est on the investment should reach six per cent.,
and then $50,000 for twenty-five years. The com-
pany had the use of two of our best vessels and
theircrewH. But six Democrats voted for the bill.
On the proposition to pay $186,765 85 for
books for members ofCongress,onlyeleven Dem-
ocrats voted for it.
The appiopnation of $100,000 for the Capitol
dome was voted for by both parlies, and there-
fore each party is responsible to the extent of the
support given to it.
X'he bill creating a Lieutenant General, and
increasing the pay of the officers and men in the
Army,, was passed by the last-Congress, and was
most cordially supported by the Opposition party
in this House.
During the Thirty-Fourth Congress, $16,022
was appropriated to pay per diem and mileage
to Archer, Fouke, Turney, Reed or, Milliken, and
Bennett, for contesting the seats of members re-
turned to that Congress; and in all those eases the
contests were decided against them. The yeas
and nays show that the Opposition are responsi-
ble for this expenditure.
During the same Congress river and harbor
bills, footing up the sum of $745,000, were passed
by the Opposition and vetoed by President Pierce,
greatly to the annoyance of the gentleman and his
party. At the first session of the same Congress
appropriations amounting to $3,189*739 were
passed for forty-one custom-houses, court-houses,
post officers, and marine hospitals Of this num-
| ber, only eleven were recommended by the Ad-
j ministration. At the third session of the same
I Congress, appropriations for the same purpose
! were made to thirty-one buildings of a like kind,
