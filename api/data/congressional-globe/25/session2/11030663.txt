the rights of the industrious and poor as my eofteagaie can be, or
any one else I vould be as much opposed to taking the bread
from the mouth of labor aa any member of this House, and it is
precisely upon this ground that f moved the proposition to ap
ply two millions of the money which if may he necessaiy to ex
pend in driving the Indians beyond the Mississippi, at the point
of the bayonet, 10 the purpose of conciliation, and to induce them
lo remove voluntarily But it is not the expense of a forirbie
removal by the military that I propose to avoid by the policy I
ídcommend Though the Indians may remove without raising
¿tomahawk, or levelling a une, at a white man, when he sees
assembled around bim an array of ibe thousand men, yet he
goes with revenge lii hw heart, and a concealed resolution to
seize the first opportunity to wreak it upon-the frontier settle
mente Andit is the tens of millions of dollars which will pro
bably have to be annually drawn from the industry of the poor,
as well as from the pockets of the rich, m supporting a laige
standing army, for the protection of the frontiei, that I propose
to save by the amendment I have offered It is offered upon a
principle of economy, as well as humanity
Before he concluded bis remarks, my colleague spoke of the
"etllogieS and encomiums" I was once m the habit of pronounc
ing oa Gen Jackson He said, if he had time, he could read
other extracts from my Nashville speech, to show how I then
eulogized his conduct and character My colleague alluded to
my former course in this íespect to demonstrate how strangely
«contrasts with my piesent mode of speaking of that distm
guisheá individual Now, bii, I deny that my colleague can
read any such extracts tm he describes fiom my Nashville
speech, or fiom any other speech I evei made in this 1 ioiiae or
out of it I defy him, 01 any other member, to show that it has
ever been my habit m my speeches, whether printed or exist
ing only in memurj, to speak of Gen Jackson in the fulsome
titrtfm of adulation and eulogy winch is so common with tho=e
who have no other merit to lerommend them to public lavor
Ineverwas a dependant 01 hanger on of that distinguished
man, though for years I suppoited the leadirgmeasui es of his
Administration faithfully, and even zealous!} I ha\e always
spoken of Gen Jackson and his cervices as 1 thought they dc
served I have always conceded to him the due meed of ap
plause and gratitute for his mihtaiy servicer, and when he first
came into power as the political chief of the countiy I was
prepared to had him first incivil renown in out day, had he
carried out all the principio  he avowed before hib elevation,
but, sir, a blight soon came over that dieam and it is some con
eolation to me now that I nevei, even when I had high expec
tationsofthe success of Gen Jaekson'sadrnin!«tiatiorí descend
ed to court either his favoi or the public applause, by pro
nouncmg unmerited eulogies upon bi> character and seivice¡>
I have now ans>weied all the material ( eints of the speech of
my colleague, I hope, in a mannei satisfactory to all who nave
heard me, and I will, tin íefore, titspab^ no longer upon the
attention of the committee
SPEECH OF MR   CLAY,
Or   KENTUCKY,
In Senate) ApiU II, 1838—On the bill to i educe the price of
ceitam of the public land-
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, i ose and addressed the Senate as
follows
I have so often, Mr President, presented my views lo the
Senate on the subject of the public domain, that I would wil
lingly avoid troubling it on this occasion But so many changes
have taken place m thi  body since I last addressed it, and I
consider this bill of buch vast impoitance, that I cannot lecon
cile it to a sense of duty to remain silent The propei admmis
trdtion of our immense public domain iuinis one of the highest
duties of Congress It is a sacred tiust, fiom the faithful dis
charge of which no partial, party, or tempoiaiy consideiations
should induce Congress to sweive A chaiacter of stability
ought to be impressed on whatever system may be adopted
Fluctuations in the policy of the Government arp not only m
jurious to the subject of the trust itself, but exercise a perm
Clous influence upon teal estate throughout the United ?■> ates
Before I proceed to a more particular examination of the
bill, I will endeavoi to describe its tiue natuie and purpu t It
proposes—
1st That, after the end oí the present yeai, all the i ubhc
lands of the United States, which had leruamed unsold ior a
term of five years, shall be reduced Uom $1 23 per acre to M
per acre.
2d That all lands which had lemamed unsold for a term of
ten years shall be reduced to $1 per acre during the next year,
and after that time to 75 cents per acre
And, 3d Thatail lands which had lemamed unsold forfitteen
years shall be reduced, during the next year, to 75 cent* pel
acre, and after that time to r)0 cents per acre
Thus it is seen that the piojett is not to giaduate the f ubhc
lands, and to affix a pi ice upon them according to then reaper
tive values, but it is to i educe the puce of the whole ol toe
public lands which, nave been untie maiket dunng the peiiods
specified in tht, bill A plan of giadua ion, according to value
would have a good deal to recommend it if it were not so difii
cult, not to say impracticable, m lib execution The principle
of such a plan would requne that the value chouid guvein in
affixing the price, vvnether it \\r above or below the minimum
of$l ¿5 per acre, now established by law But to giaduate
according to valu3 would icqmre a multitude of prices, since
no two tiacts of land aie exac 1/ aliL , and possess piecibely
the same value To avoid such various prices, m devising the
present land system of the United State , its lotmdeis thought
ft best to direct the public land*>, wlieuhibt biought mto maiket,
to be expo^pd by auction, at public sale, to the highest bidder,
and, after the termination of the public sale-, to allow the lands
to be purchased, by pnvate entiy, at a fixed rate That rate
is now $1 25 per acre—so low, su moderate, often so far below
the actual value of the land, that every mdustuous man, how
ever poor, may acquut a peimanuit home, and thousands are
enuchmg themselves by purchasing from the public, and cub
sequently selling to individuals JThis bill lb not fiamed in
conformity to the opinion oí tie President, in his message a
the opening of this session Aitei Knowing mei ited common
dation upon the silutary operation of the xi^in" Hnd system
he recommends a giaduation, lojnrk 1 upon a pieuuus salua
tion Hesuppo&e*  that if u wi&eat to know what the subject it
actually worth, and, aHei hawnc ascertained that, to affix die
price or prices accovdniKly But this bill, without the advan
a^e of that information, piot.ced& at once aibitxanly to lettuce
the puce of the public lande, aid, foi that purpose, to throw
them into three classes, nt t upon the bas^s of value, but upon
that of time
The bill will opeiate ímnWiaicly upen7I,000,000acres of
publiclands The amount in val up, which the bill will íeduce
on that quantity of the public domain, is $38,988,090 It is
equivalent io a giant of that sum, belonging to the people of
the United States li the principle of reduction containedm the
b H ba adopted, it will be piactically carried out, no doubt,
hereafter, and consequently, as each class of land, by the lapse
of tune, faills into the other, it must become subject to the pnce
of the class in Which it is merged In the space, therefore, of
ten years, 'his whole quantity of 71,000,000 acres must be re-
duced to the low price of 50 cents per acre The total amount,
therefore, of the loss, which the people of the United States must
beat by the adoption of this measure, in its direct application
to the land on which it immediately operate*, will be $53,2- 3,051,
subject, however, to a deduction fot intermediate sales These,
foi a few years to come, ai e not likeh to fce very large, owing
to the gieat quantity of public land which has been sold during
the last twj or thieeyears
But this h £ very limited view of the extent of the whole loss *
which the people of the United States will be subject to, by the
adoption ol this measure of ¡eduction If it is now sane
tioned, it will become the settled prhcy of the country, and
must be applied to all the countless millions ol waste land as
they aie heiea^tei surveyed and successively tnought into mar
ket Theie arc in the States and Territories of the United
States ahont 240,000,000 arip<¡ of public hnd yet to be brought
into market These wnl all become subiect t© the principle of
reduction Estimating at &1 25 per acre, which I have no
doubt, unier a fair administration of the land system, they
would ultimately pioduce tht total amount they would yield
would be 8300,000 000 If reduced to 50 cents per acre, the
price which, according to the policv of this bill, they must
finally íeach, the loss would be $180000000, subject toa deduc
tion of the amount which might be sold before ihey arrived at
that low rate Hut this ¡t> not the whole extent of the influence
of the poliry now attempted to be introduced of reducing the
price of the public lands, after they have been exhibited fov
shoit periods of time in the maiket lhe quantity of the
public domain, extenoi to the limits of the pie&ent States and
Temtories oí the United States, hat. been estimated at
750,000,000 acre=, all of whuh would fall beyond all doubt,
within the nope of thai policy The losb which the people of
the United Mates would su lam by u ducing the puce of that
whole quantity ol land from $1 *3 to *>0 cms pel acre may be
easily calcu'ated
But the injurious, cnYa A the uKo-niie tmdei consideration
i=< not yet all told Tn bung into maiket, at a reduced rate,
7I,O0Q,0nO acres of land- aquantit) equal to the formation of
two larjct. totites—w>uld necc&anh aficct the value of real
estate tnrou^hout the whole Union We might not be able to
distinctly tiace the opeiatum of «urh. a mcasme but rio eunsi
derate man tan hesitate to belie\e that it would exercise an
influente upon real piopeitv eveiv whirr in the United States
If theie were no public lands for sale, land would n^e m value,
because, whilst the quantity remains atationaiy there would
be a constantly increasing demand for it, ausing out of the
continual giowth of population The law which íegulatos
prices according to supply and demand, governs real estate as
well as it does commeicml commodities, and if the supply ex
ceed the demand, the price must necessarily fall It cant oí,
therefore, be doubted that if the United States, the greatest land
holder m the countiy, throw into the mdiket7I,000,G0Oacics,
at a gieatlviuluced rate, the effect must íeach eveiy landholder
in the United States, affecting most «ensibly lands in Stateb con
tlguouoto those which include the public lands
This, Mr Picsidcnt, i'a air de^cuption of the nature jnd
consequences of the proposed measme Why are we called
upoi at this moment to adopt itf The cunency i« di-oideied,

might not be altogether unreasonable, if the supply had been

the superabundant supply which has been put m the market,
in conformity with the urgent entreaties of the new State;
We must e\eicise patience, and we are urged by the highest
and most patriotic consideration© to practice that admirable vir
tuem relation to the public domain Next to our invaluable
free institutions, no single circumstance illustiates the happy
condition of the people of the United States moie strikingly thai*
the possession of thatpubhc domain Vi udently and properly
administered, it is destined to enrich the presentgeneration, and
posterity for countless ages to come. And it is a sure resource
agamstallthe evils ofpaupensm, so affheungto many of the
nations of the Old World The example of Ohro affords the
most encouraging evidence of the value of that virtue to which
1 have adverted There was m that State upwards of sixteen
and a half millions of acres of public land It has been all dis-
posed of except a quantity not exceeding 2,000 000 And not-
withstanding the reduced quantity, sales have been more active
m Ohio within a few years past, than in most of the new States.
In the Stati of Indiana, wheie the Government owned about
twenty a id i half millions of acres, all has been disposed of but
a quantity ess than mm and a half millions And I have no
doubt that r we will only wait patiently foi the operation of
natmal tauses, most of the public lands in the States northwest
ot the Ohi j river will produce to Government the very mode-
rate ,t cool$l 25peiacie, which is now demanded Tn the
Sidti <> Illinois, lam a^suied, from information derived from?
the in i^t credible and satisfactoiy souices, that there is scarcely
one íe infifty thatis notgood arable, larming land And a
vas lopoition of all the lands in the Northwestern States are
am<  g the finest and fattest soils in the world
I has been contended that, in the Southwestern States, there
a* vastquaiititiesofpme lands bairui and unproductive, and
n it worth even the 50 cents peí acie It has been, indeed, as
^ ited tbatlaige portions of them are absolutely worthless. If
t ns representation ot them be true, they will not sell under the
opera'ion of this lull Why, then, make a reduction m the
puce of these lands, when a sale of them cannot be foi ced, even
at the ipdutediate? Why reduce the price of all the lands m
the United States, good and bad, to bring it to a sfandaid which
tvill not adapt it to the condition of the \cry lands winch form
the pretext lor reduction? The effect of such a reduction will be
to hung down the good land? worth now the minimum price of
£1 25 pei acie, whilst it will have no influence upon those
which, it is asserted, aie not woi th even 50 cents pei acie Had
we not bettt.1 leave the system m undisturbed operation, until l
sale shall be effected of that pan of the public domain which is
really woi ih th*1 Govei nment pncel Is it not best to pi ofit bv i he
experience which we have derived irom the examples of Ohio
and Indiana, which as&ui e us that, with rea-onable patience, we
shall in time he able to sell all the lands in the Northwestern
region? If these pooi pine bairui lands be icaDv as worthless
a& they are íepresented to be, no one is injured by their remain
ing where they aie, undisposed of The Government would,
mueed, do an inpiry, if it wcie to tempt any pooi man to pui
chase and «ettle himself upon these unpioductive lands by íe
ducing their price to the low rate which is proposed Such a
man had bcttei eive $1 55 oi even 5S1U per acie foi íeally ier
tile land, than settle himself and his family u¡>< n ban en and
unproductive lands, if they were Given to hi n
We aie bound, Mi President, by the na me of the tiust con
fided to our care, to administer this, public pnperly as wt-
would similar pioperty U it belonged to u-* individually It
any private man owned alai a,e body of land theeieatei por
tion of which was worth $1 23 per acre, and the residue
worth not moie than-fifty cents per acre, would he commit the
folly of reducing the puce to the lowest standard* Would he
sacrifice the good land in order to make the impracticable at
tempt of selling the bad? Would he not first sell (he good, and
reservo the bad to be disponed of m future, accoidms; to circum-
stance^ Arid do not gentlpmen peiceive thn theeffect of this
hill will be to stimulate again that spuitof speculation "which
