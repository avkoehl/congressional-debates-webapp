I think it is a move on West Tennessee. Mizner's cavalry is on this front and right flank. Hatch is moving from Somerville to La Grange to close up. Tuttle is ordered with six regiments to close from La Grange up on them, or get to Corinth. Morgan with two regiments and battery moves to La Grange to-day. I will try and force them to fight.

LA GRANGE, November 28, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Could you spare One hundred and fourteenth Illinois Infantry from Memphis to come with battery to-morrow? What do you think of the idea that this movement is to be directed against Eastport, to cut off General Grant's communication on Tennessee River? The forces north of me appear to be moving eastward to-day and yesterday.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, November 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Hatch's cavalry brigade is ordered from Somerville to La Grange. You will hold your entire force at La Grange and west ready to concentrate rapidly on Corinth or Pocahontas. Issue two days' cooked rations in haversacks, and be in position to move whenever required. You have a battalion of cavalry with you. The enemy will either attack Corinth or Pocahontas or pass the road near Saulsbury. Mizner's brigade of cavalry from Corinth is in their front.

Colonel Morgan, with two regiments of infantry and a battery, will be at La Grange to-morrow.

Brig. General J. M. TUTTLE,

Commanding, La Grange, Tennessee:

The One hundred and fourteenth cannot be spared; you will have Morgan's two splendid regiments and a battery. There is nothing at Eastport. The movement east is to get away from Hatch.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
