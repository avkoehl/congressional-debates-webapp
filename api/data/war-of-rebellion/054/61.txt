Major-General Hooker directs me to say that, in accordance with instructions received from Major-General Thomas, you would be ready to move to his support. He desires that you commands move up and report to him.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS,Lookout Valley, Tennessee, October 29, 1863-3 a.m.

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

General Hooker directs me to say that he has called up the brigades of General Whitaker and Colonel Mitchell; that the enemy has been foiled in his attempt thus far to break the line. We have prisoners from two brigades of Longstreet's corps. They state that two prisoners, or all of Longstreet's corps that are here, have crossed, their aim being to prevent the opening of this line. Reports come in of sounds and commands as if massing and forming troops. The general anticipates from this and what the prisoners say a renewal of enemy's attack at daylight. He would like to have signal officers sent out.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
