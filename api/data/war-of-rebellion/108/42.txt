U. S. FLAG-SHIP CUMBERLAND,

Off Fortress Monroe, Va., April 25, 1861.

Major General WALTER GWYNN,

Commanding Forces in Nortfolk Harbor:

SIR: Your letter, under date of April 25, 1861, inclosing a communication from Colonel J. Dimick, was this moment handed me by Captain Jones, one of your aides, under a flag of truce. In reply to your communication I have to say that the schooner George M. Smith was seen with a signal of distress flying and a boat was immediately dispatched to her relief, when the steam-tug Young America was seen coming direct toward her. Thinking that the boat would not be able to bring her to a gun was fired from the ship, which had the desired effect. The said schooner was loaded with contraband of war, and was accordingly ordered under the protection of the fort, and in connection with the steam-tug Young America becomes the property of the United States Government by my order.

G. J. PENDERGRAST,

Flag-Officer, Commander-in-Chief Home Squadron.
