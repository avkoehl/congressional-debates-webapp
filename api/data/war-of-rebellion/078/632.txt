HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN.,Glade Spring, June 1, 1864.

Brigadier General J. L. KEMPER,

Commanding Reserves, Richmond, Va.:

This department is threatened with invasion. The regular troops have all been withdrawn, and I will be dependent for its defense almost entirely upon the reserves. The organization of this force should be immediate, if anything is to be accomplished with it. I think it would be best to organize it in regiments and subject to my orders.

Colonel, Commanding Department.
