Commanding Division:

You will order Bratton's brigade to prepare three days' cooked rations at once, and as soon as prepared order General Bratton to march to the Central railroad depot, in Richmond, to take the cars for Gordonsville. General Hunton's brigade, of Pickett's division, is also going to the same place. General Bratton will probably get off first. Arriving at Gordonsville, he will make disposition of his command to hold the place, and, on the arrival of General Hunton, will report to him. A force of the enemy, estimated to amount to about 4,000 cavalry, with four pieces of artillery, is supposed to be operating against Gordonsville. Cars will be ready for Bratton's troops by midnight. They will be gone about a week, and will leave guards in charge of all property left in camp. you can supply Bratton's place in our line in such way as you think most judicious. Notify me of the time they will be able to get off.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
