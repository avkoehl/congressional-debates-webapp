him that it could not be less than $900,000, but
Mr. Swartwout said he did not think it exceeded
#600,000
In reply to our inquiry as to what had become
of tne money, Mr Ogden said that he was totally
at a loss to conceive how such a sura could have
been exhausted, that Mi Swartwout had been a
iaige speculator in stocks for seveial years, and
that he had known his operations in them to
amount to some hundred shares a day, that he had
been a loser for ft large sum by the failure of the
Josephs, to whom he knew of his actually loa ling
$25,000 a day or two before their failure, that he
had made immense puichases of lands m Texas,
and that he also had heavy interests in the Cum-
berland coal lands It did not appeal, however,
that Mr Ogden could account foi an expenditure
bo large as the ascertained defalcation
In reply to oui inquiry as to Mr Swartwout's
property, Mr Ogden stated his inability to give a
particular account of it He said that the funds
in bank, known to him, did not exceed $29,000,
that there was a house in this city, land at Hobo-
ken, on which there was an incumbrance of about
§50,000, but which he thought worth $100,000
more, that there was, besides, some land in Illi-
nois, the Cumberland property, and the propeity
in Texas.
Mr Ogden then stated that he had a full power
of attorney from Mr Swartwout, under which he
was tlesuous to act, as, under the cneumstances
of the case, he thought his duty required, and Mr
Swartwout himself could not object to He stated
thatpiobably Mr Swaitwout would return in the
steamship expected next week, that he had written
urging him to do so, especially on his being ap-
prised that the sureties had íeceived notice tiom
the Comptroller that the accounts had not been
rendered, that, although he had no duect account
of his intention to return, he thought it most prob
able he would do so He assured us that, in the
mean time.no measures should be taken under his
powei of attorney to interfere with the claims of
the United States; and he finally agreed to trans-
fer to them, under that instrument, the property
of Mr Swartwout, and offered to meet us on the
following day for that purpose, at the office of the
district, attorney.

Sir Since >h joint report of the Comptroller
and myself, on the 8th instant, the investigations
into the defalcation of Mr Swartwout, and the
steps which seemed expedient in relation to it,
have been continued without intermission They
have pioved very laborious, and in no degree
tended to lesseri*the amount of the deficiency, or
change the character of the transaction
All the abstracts, vouchers, and other docu-
ments, relating to the collector's account for the
first quaiter of 1838, (being the last of Mi Swart
wout'b term,) which had never been furmsned,
have been now tiansmitted to the First Auditoi
These documen s, howevei, want the signature of
Mr Swartwout, though prepared by the officer
who transacted that branch of his officiil business
The cause of their being thus incomplete appears
to have been the desire of Mr Swartwout that
they should not be furnished to the accounting
officers until his return fiom abroad By that
time, according to th« statements of Mr Ogden,
he hoped to be able to make arrangements for the
settlement of the whole defalcation The want of
them, howevei, delayed the present collector in
the completion of his own accounts, as it was
necessary to include therein an accurate statement
of the balances in cash and uncollected bonds,
handed ovei by Mr Swartwout, and that the same
should agree with the final accounts of the latter,
as rendered to the Treasury Department The
urgent demand for this, made by the present col-
lector upon the officer having charge of these ac-
counts, and the difficulty of obtaining it, first led
to the suspicions communicated by him to the
Department, which were rendered more certain by
the subsequent examinations he immediately insti-
tuted
Mr Underwood completed, on Thursday even-
ing, the examination of the books and documents
at the custom house, so far as to enable him, with
the addition of the information already possessed
at 'he Treasury, to state the account of Mr Swart
wout so as to exhibit truly the amount due to the
United States He then proceeded to Washington
for the purpose of having the account finally ad-
justed and passed by the accounting officers, as
the act of Congress requires, and expected to re-
turn it to me, at this place, duly certified, by the
12 h mutant When it is received, we shall be
able to adopt the summary proceedings by distress
wanant, authorized by the act of May 15, 1820,
should the interests of the United States make that
couise most advisable
It appeared pioper, however, without waiting
for this, to take whatever measures weiepossible
foi the immediate security of the United States
On examining the letter of attorney from Mr
Swartwout to Mr Ogden, I found thatitconferred
on the latter the fullest agency He was entirely
impressed with the propriety of adopting under it
such measures foi the security of the United States
as were in his power He has paid over to me the
sum of $30,000 in cash, being the deposit in bank
referred to in the last report This sum I have
placed to the credit of the Treasurer of the United
States, on special deposit, in the Bank of America,
and herewith mclo&e you duplicate receipts of the
cashier therefor Mr Ogden has also executed,
as the attorney of Mi Swartwout, three mortgages
ofall his property in the States of New York, New
Jersey, and Maryland The specific portions of
propeity belonging to Mr Swartwout in those
States were not all known to Mr Ogden, but they
are described as fully as his information permitted,
and the mortgages embrace, generally, all Mr
Swartwout's estate Neither Mr Price nor myself
have been able to learn that there is any other
property, real or personal, unless it be the house-
hold furniture The mortgages have been placed
for record m the register's office of this city, and
of Bergen county, New Jersey, and I have for-
warded that embracing the property in Maryland,
to thedistnctattorney there, with a request to have
it recorded in the proper office without delay.
These mortgages include the house and lots in this
city, the large and valuable meadow property at
Hoboken, and the interest in the coal lands at
Cumberland. As to their value, I have no means
of forming an opinion, but it is rated by Mr Ogden
at a very large amount
The investigation into the details of this defal-
cation is necessarily very difficult and tedious
Eight or nine yeais have elapsed since it com-
menced The books and accounts through which
it is to be traced are numerous, as it was carried
on through the various peuods when the public
moneys were collected and kept in the blanch
Bank of the United States, the selected deposit
banks, and by the collector himself The different
classes of revenue received, which, as was stated
in our last repoit, were successively resorted to
at different periods, multiply the researches into
the general accounts, which are of vast complex-
ity and amount, and the false statements and
other entile  in regard to these transactions, made
with a view to give the appearance of coirectness
to the official returns, and prevent discovery, in-
crease the present difficulty Prom Mr Phillips,
the assistant cashier during Mr Swartwout's of-
ficial term, we received a verbal statement, con-
firming that previously made to us by Mr Ogden,
and, in a written communication, he has given a
general viewof the course of proceeding, to which I
he has offered to add such a particular account of
the details of the transactions as he can gather
from the books and accounts When Mr Under-
wood returns here, I hope that his knowledge of
such accounts and his great industry and accuracy
may enable him to trace out the whole of this
complicated proceeding, step by step, from the
beginning to the close
I will forward to you, as soon as they can be
prepared, copies of the written statements of Mr
Ogden and Mr. Phillips; of the letter of attorney
of Mr Swartwout to Mr Ogden? and of the three
mortgages of Mr Swartwout's property
Very respectfully, yours,
H. D. GILPIN.
Hon Levi Woodbury,
Secutaiy of His Treasury
New York, November 13, 1838
Sir- Yesterday I received a duly certified tran-
script of the account of Mr Swartwout, as finally
stated by the accounting officers, showing a bal-
ance due from him, as late collectoi of the revenue
for the poit of New York, of $1,344,119 63
In pursuance of the provisions of the act of
15th May, 1820,1 forthwith issued a warrant of
distress against the said Samuel Swartwout, and
Benjamin Birdsall, Charles L Livingston, and.
Mangle M Cuackenboss, the sureties in the
official bond of Mr Swartwout, which Was for-
warded from the office of the First Comptroller
of the Treasury The warrant of distress, with
a copy of the account, was delivered to the mar^
shal, and he pioceeded without delay to mase a
levy on the estate of Mr Swartwout and his sure-
ties in this district.
In order to perfect the lien in the manner tfte
act requires, the marshal has already caused the
levies he has made, with the dates, to be recorded
in the office of the clerk of the district court fox
this district, and will continue so to do as addi-
tional property may be ascertained.
Although the parties are resident in this dis-
trict, yet as the act of Congress contemplates the
issue of different warrants where the estate in-
tended to be taken and sold is situate in different
districts, I have issued one to the marshal of
Maryland, and another to the marshal of New
Jersey, and 1 have dnected the most rigid scrutiny
to ascertain the property that can be levied on.
The only account of any in either State that I
have been able to obtain is that embraced m the
two mortgages to the United States, referred to m
my last report, but it is supposed there maybe
other property or interests in some companies,
incorporated or unincorporated At all events, a
more full description of that and all other will he
obtained and embraced in the return and record
of the levy, so as to make the security of the
United States more complete than under the mort-
gage
Under the distress warrant here, the marshal is
causing the most careful search to be made for the
purpose of discovering whether there are any
moneys or stocks belonging to Mr Swartwout of
which we have not been heretofore informed, go
far, it does not appear that there are, and the
general impression seems to be, that he is not pos-
sessed of any such property It is among the
most íemarkable circumstances in this case that
so little should, apparently, remain out of such a
vast amount of money   *
The return of Mr Swartwout by the steamship
is still looked for She has not arrived, bat is
hourly expected
In my last report I stated to you the circum-
stances which rendered it a work of extreme diffi-
culty and delay to trace the details of this long-
continued defalcation Since the return of Mr.
Underwood yesterday, and his ability (now that
the statement of the account is completed) to deyote
his attention exclusively to this branch of the case,
considerable progress has been made The gen-
eral system by which the money was abstracted,
and the deficiency concealed, has been already
stated to you, as derived from the information of
Mr Ogden and Mr Phillips, confiimed by the
examinations of the Comptroller and myself I
now, however, feel satisfied that we shall be able
to trace out the whole proceedings, so as to show
exactly the times, amounts, and modes, in which
the various sums of money were respectively
taken
Very respectfully, yours,
H.D GILPIN.
Hon. Levi Woodbury,
Secretary of the Treasury.
New York, November 15, 1838.
Sir   We have completed, with the aid of Mr,
Underwood, the examination of the records of the
