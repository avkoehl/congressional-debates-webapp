to me. The enemy will soon tap our lines. I establish a chain guard and impress the citizens this morning, also the quartermaster's men. All will be done that can be done to meet attack; and the place will never be given up while I live to defend it; rely on that.

I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

JOHN McNEIL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 27, 1864.

General JOHN McNEIL,

Rolla:

Will send you a map as soon as it can be traced; cipher operator if one can be found. The general says "all right" the your letter.

J. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Keep a string of scouts out and try every way to get one to Mower.

J. V. DU BOIS.

SAINT LOUIS, September 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General McNEIL:

Have you any scouts near the Arkansas line? Can you communicate with General Mower, who should be somewhere there now? If Mower can send word to Cape Girardeau, or to you, it would be important.

J. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

ROLLA, MO., September 27, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

I have no scout now in the direction of Arkansas. My last failed to get to Price or Shelby's camp. I will try to get one through and communicate with Mower.

JOHN McNEIL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General McNEIL,

Rolla, Mo.:

We have word that some rebels appeared at Mineral Point. No news from the Knob since my last. Look out for bridges up this way, and smash every small raiding party that comes, as they always will, in advance of the main force. Let me hear from Sanborn if you get news.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
