a penalty of fifty per centrum of said taxes, shall be a lien upon the tracts or lots of the same, severally charged, till paid.

Done at the city of Washington this first day of July, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-sixth.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

By the President:

F. W. SEWARD,

Acting Secretary of State.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., July 1, 1862.

Hon. WILLIAM H. SEWARD:

The existing law does not authorize an advance of the bounty, and the Department ought not to promise it. I think the measure is wise and judicious, and have heretofore urged it. I will have a conference with the Military Committee this morning, and if they sanction it the preliminary measures might proceed on that basis. Discreet persons here suggest that the call should be for 300,000 men - double the number you propose - as the waste will be large. Consider the matter. The President has not come into town yet; when he arrives you will receive his answer.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, July 1, 1862.

Hon. WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Astor House, New York:

The President approves your plan, but suggests 200,000 if it can be done as well as the number your mention.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

NEW YORK, July 1, 1862-1 p.m.

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The $25 is of vital importance. We fail without it. Can"t you pay it out of the $9,000,000 if Congress fail to alter the law? We can"t wait for debate. The iron is getting hot. Need to strike immediately. We can lift number up to high figure. President's reply is needed. If I get this completed here to-day I go to Boston to-night.

W. H. SEWARD.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, July 1, 1862- 2 p.m.

Hon. WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Astor House, New York:

Your telegram received. I will take the responsibility of ordering the $25 bounty out of the $9,000,000 at all hazards, and you may go on that basis. I will make and telegraph the order in an hour. The President's answer has already gone.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
