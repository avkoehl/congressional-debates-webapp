THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 4,
And first, I am aware that there exists dif-1
ferent theories on the subject of finance, and
to some of which I desire to pay a passing
notice before presenting the opinions I enter-
tain pn that subject. The opinions of the dis-
tinguished gentleman from.Massachusetts [Mr.
Buti.br] are exceedingly novel. He proposes
to revolutionize the whole financial theory of
th« world by making irredeemable paper money
the exclusive circqlation of the country, making
the precious metals an article only of com-
merce; and the reasons for adopting such
policy he gives us in the closing paragraphs
of his summing up, as follows : that gold and
silver is the money of the barbarian and the
despot and should not be adopted as the
instrument of exchange of an enlightend and
free people. To this theory I respectfully dis-
sent, believing, as I do, that the only safety to
the commercial interests of our country and its
progressive development in the future is to re-
sume specie payment at the earliest possible
period consistent with safety and sound policy,
and which I believe can be done within the
period of six years, and so gradual as not to
bring a financial crisis upon the country or
cause a contraction in the voluinn of currency
now in circulation, if it can be shown that a
resumption of specie payments can safely take
place within a period of six years without con
traction and without bringing a.iinancial crash
upon the laboring and commercial interests of
the country, then I think we will accomplish
what the interests of the nation require. Before,
however, discussing the plan which in my hum-
ble judgment I think will accomplish that re-
sult, 1 desire to speak of our present national
banking system, that seems to receive so large
a share of the anathemas of the advocates of
an irredeemable paper currency; and while I
do not appear as the special advocate of the
national banks, I desire only to do justice to
all men. _ Now, sir, I assert that the national
banks did more lor our aid in furnishing means
to prosecute the war lor the maintenance of
our Union during the struggle than any other
class of people of the same amount of capital
in the United States, and for the proof of which
I appeal to the history of the country during
the war and thecondition of our finances during
that period. And now for the facts. In 1801
the war had assumed a gigantic attitude, which
threatened the entire overthrow of the Kepub-
lic. We had inherited from our predecessors
a bankrupt Treasury and a dishonored national
eredit; we had large armies to raise and a
Navy to construct; we had no money to do
either. Mr. Chase, then Secretary of the Treas-
ury, visited New York", the money center of the
country, to obtain money to equip our armies,
pay our soldiers, and provide a navy for our
national defense. The capitalists of ijfew York
proposed and did aid the Government in tem-
porary Joans, but charged for the same exor-
bitant interest and claimed the right to dictate
the financial policy of the Government in the
management of its finances. The Secretary
at once discovered that such a policy would
bring ruin and bankruptcy upon the people,
and after having secured through Congress
the issue of greenback or legal-tender notes,
as a war necessity, suggested to Congress the
organization of a national banking, system
niakiug the bonds of the Government a col-
lateral security for the redemption of their cir-
culation. It will be remembered that the bonds
of the Government at this time had no sales
in the markets of lijorope, or if any demand
existed it was at a ruinous discount. And,
mdeed, I might add that our own people to a
large extent lelt some doubts as to our ability
to successfully, suppress tho rebellion, arising
from the want of unanimity on the part of
northern Democrats to sustain the Government
in her efforts to crush the rebellion. Now,
what was the result? The loyal men of the
iSiorth men of capital and financial experience,
came forward and organized under our national
banking law, and took from the Government
her bonds, and furnished $300,000,000 to our
national Treasury to enable her to pay our sol-
diers, who had left their homes at the call of
the country without having had time to provide
for their families during their absence in the
service.
The fact that men of capital and business
experience were willing to invest their means
in the bonds of the Governmentinspired con-
fidence in the minds of our entire loyal popu-
lation-to such an extent that through th«se
agencies, the national banks, over five hun-
dred millions of our bonds were sold to our
own citizens, the proceeds of which went into
our national Treasury to aid in the prosecu-
tion of the war, and without which, in my
opinion, the war might have met with serious
obstructions in its prosecution. I feel, there-
fore, that the people of the United States, and
more particularly these financial theorists who
denounce the'national banks as swindling cor-
porations, should speak in rather more moder-
ate terms of the bridge that aided to no incon-
siderable extent in carrying them safely over
the chasm of rebellion.
Mr. Chairman, I am fully of the opinion that
as a great commercial nation whose boundaries
are cqntiuental in extent, with our rapid pro-
gress and development, we must have some
system of national banking based upon a spe-
cie basis that shall be commensurate with the
wants of our people arid whose circulation
shall be uniform throughout the United States.
And 1 believe the present system, with such
modification and amendment as time and ex-
perience has,shown to be necessary and safe-
guards to the people, such as Congress can
furnish by appropriate legislation, is the only
true system of our_ people. I think that the
restriction clause limiting the amount of issue
to $300,000,000 should be removed, making it a
free national bankingsystem,open equally toall.
If this should be deemed impracticable, then
there should be a redistribution equally to the
States and Territories of the present author-
ized $300,000,000. 1 know that it is charged
that the national banks are making money and
speculating upon the industry of the laboring
millions. 1 think I am safe in saying that cap-
ital employed in any branch of industry is also
nrakiug money. The fanner, sir, is making
money, and receiving remuuerative consider-
ations for .the productions of his. farm, in
fact, capital and labor throughout our whole
country are now co-workers together, and each
receiving its proper consideration in return.
But suppose the national batiks do make-large
dividends, the Government is a stockholder in
every national bank in the United States and
receives one twentieth of its entire dividends,
and to this the tax-payer certainly can have
no objections. , I think, Mr. Chairman, when
we shall corns back to specie payment, as we
surely shall within a reasonable period, and
confidence shall be once more restored to our
country, we shall go .on to unparalleled pros-
perity; and by economy in our national expend-
itures and honesty in the collection of our rev-
enues we shall astonish the most sanguine of
our people.
But, sir, the national banks are again charged
by these now financial theorists, or that portion
of them who hint at repudiation, with not being
taxed to any considerable extent, while they are
making large dividends to their stockholders. I
assert, sir, upon the official record and figures,
that no amount of capital invested in any other
business in the United States pays so large a tax
to the-national and state treasuries as our na-
tional banks pay, averaging between four and
five per cent, upon the entire capital invested,
as will appear by the appended official state-
ment of the Comptroller of the Currency for
1807, which I insert for the benefit of these
croakers against national banks and the repu-
diators of the national honor. And from this
report it will be seen that the national banks,
during the fiscal year ending December 31,18(37,
paid into yournational and State treasuries, in
the aggregate, $18,338,734"23, as per detailed
statement, as follows:

has it fulfilled^ its mission ; it was simply and
