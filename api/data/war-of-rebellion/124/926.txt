of the Government those who are incapable of private and public service. It is indispensable that the Government should decide immediately what is to be done with these two different classes of charities, both of which are increasing in magnitude and importance. If the property which is now applied in a very great degree to the aggrandizement of individual fortunes cannot be applied to the support of these people, appropriations must be made directly by the Government for this purpose. I wait with solicitude your instructions upon this subject.

You must pardon my renewed reference to this question on the ground of its pressing importance.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,
