FORT SCOTT, May 9, 1865.

General R. B. MITCHELL,

Fort Leavenworth:

Henry Taylor's command of bushwhackers have broken up into small squads and scattered. The balance have all gone north. They crossed the Osage River near Papinsville, Mo., and Grand River near the east line of Bates County, Mo. My troops followed their trail that far. They claimed to be Shelby's men and committed but few depredations, seeming to be anxious to get through the country as quietly as possible.
