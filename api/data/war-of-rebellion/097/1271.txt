her. By your discipline, long marches, and hard fighting you have established for yourself a name second to none in the Army. Your badge has become an emblem of energy, valor, and patriotism, and is a source of just pride to all who wear it. Those of you who are entering civil life should still wear it on all occasions as an evidence to your brothers who remain in service of your pride as a badge made sacred by the blood of so many brave men, and your disposition, should your country ever again call you to arms, to again assemble under that proud emblem and revive the glory of the Twenty-fourth Corps. To our comrades who are leaving the service we pledge a kind farewell and wish that their career in civil life may be as successful and prosperous as their military life has been alike honorable to themselves and beneficial to their country.
