CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
§
Sec. 13. .And be it further enacted. That every
captain, engineer, pilot or other person employed
mi navigating any steamboat or vessel propelled in
whale or in part by steam, by whose misconduct,
seghgence, or inattention to his or their respective
duties, the life or lives of any person or persons on
board said vessel, may he destroyed, shall be deem-
ed guilty of manslaughter, and upon conviction
thereof before any Circuit Court of the United
States, shall be sentenced to confinement at hard
labor for a period not less than two nor more than
ten vears.
The bill, having beea read twice, was re-
ferred toa eommttteeconsistingof Messrs. Grunbt,
Wall, Clayton, Bjcnton, Calhoun, Webster,
and Walker, and ordered to be printed.
Mr GRUNDY moved that the Chair appoint the
standing committees.
Mr. CLAY said he had no particular feeling on
the subject: he had no objection to the course pro-
posed at this time.
Mr. KING of Alabama thought the regular
mode of proceeding would be to ¡rive notice to
amend the rule, if it were desired to get nil of the
present mode of appointing committees. Previous
to the rule, the Vice President did not appoint the
committees; it was the h«ibit for that ofhcer to re-
sign the seat •some days befoie the close of the ses-
sion, and a chairman to be appointed pro tern..
on whom that duty devolved. It would be recol-
lected that some years ago there was a long and
animated dueussum on the powers of the Vice Pre-
sident. It was doubted by some whether that
oliicer should be trusted with the auth inty to call
the Senate to order. In the present instance he had
no objection to the Vice President appointing
the committees, but was unwilling to remind the
rule.
Mr. G1UTNDY explained his object (o be to save
Ume and trouble, and as his object could only be
reached by unanimous consent, he hoped there
■would be no objection.
Mr CLAY said he concurred in the views of the
genueman from Tenne^ee.
Mi. HUBBARD moved that the Senate proceed,
on to-morrow, to appoint the standing lommittces
Mr. BUCHANAN sattl, on the piesent occasion,
he was fur dispensing with the rule, but would be
unwilling to ieüciixl it, Tlislt as he thonulit
of the occupant of th,i> chair, he was not disposed
to vest Inm with the powei to appoint the commit-
tees. He concuned, however, wuh the views of
the gentleman from Tennessee, (Mr. Grundy) tint
the mode suggested by him would sive nine, ami
as the ballot oi last September would fnmis-h n
guide, be presumed the mods would he most desi-
rabie.
Mr. Hubbard having wjihdiawn his motion, the
Chai  vva* vested with the p >vvt r of appointing the
standing committees, by the unanimous coii'-eiii of
the Senate
Mr. TIPTON gav  notice that he would, on to-
jnonovv, introduce a lull to amend the act entitled
" An act to provide for tha exchange of hinds with
the Indians n -idmg in any of the Stttcsand Tem-

p ;" also, a bill to provide for the lehei of 1'eti.r

Tins cnmputat'on would leave m
the Treasury,  on   the   first of
January, 1838, a balance of    -   34,187,143 29
Belore advening to other topics, it \\i 1 he proper
to explain w hat portion of this balance will not ím-
mediatelv be either available or applicable to pub-
lic pui poses.
The first three instalments of deposits with the
several Stale , vvhuh have recently been placed to
the credit of the Treasurer for safe-Keep ng, in con-
formity to ihe provisions of the act of 23d June,
1836, are included in it.
As the subsequent law of Octobei 14th, 1837,
prohibits the recall of those deposits fill otheivuse
directed b> Congiess, their laige amount wJI till
then be unavailable lor aij purj oses of the Gen-
eral Government.    Il is §29,101,644 97
All the funds in the Tieasury, which in any for-
mer yeais, from the foundation of the Govern-
ment, have betone unava'lable, being chiefly such
a  aie still due from insolvent banks, are likewise
embraced in the balance above mentioned. Their
amount is not far from §1,100,000.
Another portion consists of what is yet unpaid by
the banking institutions, w hich, during the last spring
and summer, suspended specie payments, and
thereby, under the imperative provisions of the
deposite act, were discontinued as public deposi-
tories. The amounts in their possession that have
been or probably will, under the act of 16th of
Oclohei last, be postponed, and wid remain una-
vailable, one third till July next, one-third till
January, 1839, and ihu íesidue till July, 1839, aie
estim ited at 4,3,500,000.
Another sum, not immediately applicable to
geneial purposes, is that part of the amounts trans-
feired to the mint, which being now in ae.ive
emplovment foi the objects specified m the acts of
June 23, 1836, and of Ja.iuiry 18, 1837, cannot,
without serious inconvenience and some delay, be
otherwise used     This sum is ibout ¡J400,000.
If ÚV aggregate ot all tnese, amounting to
$33,101,614 91, be deducted from ihe balance of
£.14,187,113 29 above mentioned, the residue of
tho public money that on the 1st of January next
«ill prob ibly be then both avada' le and applicable
to general purpo-es will be «J' ,085,498 32.
Perhaps, m sine mess, the sum ot about $370,797,
which veas oi tlu> Tietsury on account of set eral
small unst fun N, and wis mc'udtd in the balance
on the 1st c r J-mii ,r\, 1836, ought also to be de-
ducted liom what is now considered applicable to
public piopos.es.

for the s| ecial o' j< cts io vc Inch it belouss.
