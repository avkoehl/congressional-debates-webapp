Question. When was that?
Answer. In October, 1865, I went there.
Question. Do you know what influences were
used to procure contracts for him ?
Answer. I do not.

contractor after the election in 1867?
Answer. I could not say.
Question. Was he for or against Mr. Pome-
boy, as between Pomeroy and Carney?
Answer. It would be impossible for me to
say. J never knew him to be identified with
it at all. In the contest between Boss and
Carney he was for Mr. Ross positively. Up to
tliat'time 1 do not remember what his position
was.
Question. You do not remember whether he
was for Pomeroy or Carney in the contest
between them?
Answer. I never knew him to identify him-
self as to the contest between individuals until
I knew him identified with Mr. Ross, working
for his election.

Answer. It was supposed he was for Mr.
Ross.

[The foregoing testimony having been read
over to the witness, he adds:] The question is
asked me, "Did there seem to be any prevail-
ing sentiment in favor of any one before the
election of the members of the Legislature?"
to which I answered, "Nothing more than
discussions which always occur.'' I will say
that there was an almost universal sentiment
in favor of the reelection of Senator Pomeroy.

Answer. I can state the fact I stated there
in that report, how I learned the fact in refer-
ence to that $100.
Mr. Logan. State it.
I'iie Witness. I can give the circumstances,
i heard them, that brought the fact to my
knowieuge. I will state that the first day of
the ballot there was a good deal of excitement.
I think it was in the afternoon that, the friends
of Mr. Pomeroy seemed to be somewhat dis-
appointed as to the result of the ballot—a pre-
liminary- vote, I think it was. After the bal-
loting was over, I was down at the Capitol
Hotel, where Mr.- Pomeroy's friends were
staying, and they were cursing and swearing
about some man that had gone back on them,.
I learned that this man—I do not recollect <jf
hearing his name then, but I ,heard since it
was Wells—had $100 paid to Mr. Horton to
secure his seat, with the understanding that he
should vote for Mr. Pomeroy, and he had gone
back on them, and either voted for Carney on
the first ballot, or against them on some pre-
liminary vote. That is how I come to know
that fact.
Question. Who was this man that you say
$100 was paid to ?
Answer. I did not know his name when I
was before the committee. Ihavesince learned
that it was Mr. Wells. I do not know that the
man's name was stated to me at the time. The
fact was stated in that way.
Question. You say this $100 was paid to him
for what purpose?
Answer. It was paid, I understood, to Mr.
Horton, his attorney; it was a contested seat;
it was paid to Mr. Horton, as his attorney, to
secure his seat.
Question. Wells bad a contested seat?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. And Horton was paid $100 as the
attorney for Wells?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Horton was not in the Legisla-
ture?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. He was a mere lawyer outside?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. You understood $100 was paid by
Mr. Pomeroy?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Prom whom did you understand
that ?
Answer. I would not like to be positive. It
was stated among the friends of Mr. Pomeroy
at the hotel while this excitement occurred
after the first ballot. There were twenty men
in the room, may be.
Question. Do you know whether Mr. Wells
was a Pomeroy man or not ?
Answer. I did not know him.
Question. Did you even talk with Mr. Wells
on the subject ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Are you acquainted with him
now ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Are you acquainted with Mr. Hor-
ton ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Did you ever talk with him on the
subject ?
Answer. I never did, sir.
Question. Then as I understand you, you
heard a conversation between the friends of
Mr. Pomeroy ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Where it was stated that Mr.
Pomeroy had given Mr. Horton, who was an
attorney and cot a member of the Legislature,
$100?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. To defend the seat of Mr. Wells,
which was being contested in the Legislature?
Answer. Yes, sir. That was my understand
ing.
Question. Have you any knowledge what-
ever of that yourself?
Answer. No, sir; no more than I have
stated.
Question. Mere rumor ?
Answer. I merely heard it among these men
there.
Question. You do not know Mr. Wells?
Answer. I do not know Mr. Wells.
Question. You know Mr. Horton?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. But never talked with him on that
subject ?
Answer, No, sir.
Question. You have no knowledge of your
own on the subject ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Do you know who gave you this
information ?
Answer. No, sir. I am not positive, because
it was talked of among so many. It has been
many years ago. It was talked- of among the
friends of Mr. Pomeroy. I would not dare to
be positive on that point.
Question. Do you know whether there was
aay probability of Mr. Pomeroy being defeated
in that contest?
Answer. Yes, sir; I understood there was.
Question. Do you know how the vote stood ?
Answer. I don't remember. I was in the
hall on the final ballot, but at the first vote
they didn't allow but one or two men in to
each member. Each man had the right to take
two friends with him—to admit two friends on
the floor. I was on the floor.
Question. Do you know whether Mr. Carney
received any votes for Senator against Mr.
Pomeroy?
Answer. I have forgotten just exactly the
nature of the contest. I know Mr. Carney
was a candidate in opposition to Mr. Pomeroy,
but my impressibn is that at the last Mr. Car-
ney came up for simply the short term.
Question. I will call your attention to the
journal of the senate of Kansas and refresh
your recollection. The journal shows that on
that ballot for the long term there was no one
voted for except Mr. Pomeroy and Mr. Lee.
Answer. I had some conversation with Gov-
ernor Carney when I first went there. I know
he was a candidate for the long term against
Mr. Pomeroy, and I know Governor Carney
told me the last morning before the first ballot
that he was not a candidate against Mr. Pome-
roy. but for the short term.
Question. The journal shows that Lee only
was balloted for against Mr. Pomeroy.
Answer. I know he was a candidate for the
long term before that. He so told me.
Question. Mr. Pomeroy seems to have
received 84 votes against 25 on the final vote
that decided it. Was the contest, of such a,
character as would justify the belief that
was necessary to resort to any means other
thau fair ones to secure Mr. Pomeroy's elec-
tion?
Answer. Only in the first of the contest
there was. My opinion is that the opinion
prevailed at the commencement that Mr. Car-
ney's chances were just as good as Mr. Pome-
roy's.
Question. If the opinion prevailed that his
chances were just as good as Mr. Pome-
roy's—you were there all the time 
The Witness. No, sir; I think I arrived at
Topeka about ten days before the election. I
would not be positive. I was sent for.
Question. If that was the state of things at
first, what transpired that caused such a change
as to give Mr. Pomeroy 84 votes against 25,
while Mr. Carney received no votes?
Answer. Well, sir, I don't know that I can
give any reason. I don't know that I could
tell what produced the change. I simply
know the fact, and I have heard it stated
repeatedly by men who were there, that at the
outset Mr. Carney's chances were good, but
Mr. Pomeroy simply out-generaled him.
Question. But what was the immediate
cause that brought the thing about?
Answer. I don't know. I have heard—but
I will not state what I have heard.
Question. Ts there any other fact that you
know m connection with this matter?
Answer. No, sir; I don't know that there is.
Question. Mr., Wells, you say, did not vote
for Mr. Pomeroy?
