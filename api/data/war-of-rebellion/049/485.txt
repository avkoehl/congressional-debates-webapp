GENERAL: Your note of 8. 15 is just received. I will lose no time in crossing at the point assigned to me. My success, if I am first over, will be attributable to advantages of ground on this side of the Rapidan, of which I will make myself aware early to-morrow.

Lieutenant Colonel O. H. HART,

Asst. Adjt. General, Third Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report the condition of the roads between Brandy Station and Jacobs' Ford as follows:

Upon arriving within one-half mile of Mountain Run the road is muddy and deep to the run. The ford is good, and about 2 feet deep. After passing the house of J. Turner, about one-eighth mile, the road is very bad through 1 mile of forest. The road from Germanna plank road to Jacobs' Ford, about 1 1/4 miles, is bad, and needs repair. The remainder of the road is practicable for artillery and trains.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAMUEL ALEXANDER,

Acting Engineer.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 25, 1863.

This report will give a good general idea of the practicability of the road. Alexander is a man to be relied on.
