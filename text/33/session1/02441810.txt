JAMES B. SOAVV, Co mphvlhrT"
Now, sir, suppose this transaction had been
between individuals in place of between nations,
and was before a court of justice, would not the
party violating his contract be condemned to re-
fund the money expended by the other, in con-
sequence of the violation of the contract, as well
as the damages which have been sustained ?
I shall support this bill, as it is to be sub-
mitted to Texas for her approval or rejection.
There is now in the Treasury of the United States
$5,000,000 in bonds, bearing an interest of five
per cent., redeemable in fourteen years from their
date, which was in 1850; four years' interest is
now due. If these bonds are allowed to run on
to maturity, there will then be due upon them
$3,500,000 interest; this, added to the §5,000,000
of principal, would make $8,500,000, the sum
proposed to be appropriated now in payment of
these bonds. ,*
I had intended, sir, if this bill bad come ujp at
an earlier clay of the session, to have offered an
amendment providing that   boatd of commis-
sioners, or the officers of the Treasury, should be
authorized and required to take testimony, and as-
certain and pay the amount which may be found
justly and equitably due to Texas on account of the
Indian incursions upon Texas. But, sir, we have
not time now to investigate this subject as fully as
it may be desirable. The friends of the bill are
desirous of having a voteupon it as itstands, and I
. have, therefore, concluded not to offpr the amend-
ment.
, But here, in my place, [ distinctly announce that
! 1 believe this claim to be just. 1 behevetms Gov-
1 ernment in honor bound to pay it; and so believ-
j ing, 1 shall, upon all proper occasions, as long as
j Texas honors me with a commission as her rep-
resentative, continue to press this claim until it
shall be paid.
Mr. MASON. I move to postpone the further
consideration of tins bill until to-morrow, with
the view of going into Executive session.
The motion to postpone was agreed to.
HOUSE BILLS REFERRED.
The bill from the House af Representatives
creating a new collection district in the State of
New York, to be called the district of Dunkirk,
and to constitute Dunkirk a port of entry, and
the ports of Barcelona, Silver Creek, and Catta-
raugus Creek, ports of delivery, was read twice
Comptrom.kr's Office, March 20, 1854.
This, sir, does not. cover all the expenses, so that
it may be safely asserted that more than one half
the entire debt of Texas was created in defending
herself against the hostile incursions of Indians
whom you were bound by treaty stipulations to
restrain, to say nothing of the magnanimity which
ought to have been shown by a great and powerful
nation towards a weak neighbor, struggling for lib-
erty and existence. The damages to the Repub-
lic of Texas growing out of these transactions
were incalculable.
The controversy between Texas and Mexico
was soon settled,for all practical purposes. After
the battle of San Jacinto, the war with Mexico
was a nominal affair. Our debt was small, and
we had, so far as Mexico was concerned, quiet
possession of an empire of the most desirable
lands upon this continent. The United Slates
Indians, however, had possession of a lai^e por-
tion of the most valuable of them; and not con-
tent with retaining that possession, were daily
committing ravages of the most appalling charac-
ter upon our frontier inhabitants. The property
of our citizens was taken, men were shot down at
the plow, neither age nor sex were spared, and
women and children were carried off into a cap-
tivity far worse than death. Accounts of these
ravages found their way into the newspapers, and
thousands were prevented from removing toTexas
who would otherwise have done so, while many
who were already there were induced to leave the
country.
Our debt, after the Mexicans were expelled from
the country, amounted to less than a million of
dollars. Our Government was placed upon an
economical footing, and we should very soon have
been able, from the sale of our lands, to have paid
our debts, and supported the Government. But,
the fact that your Indians were in possession of
the lands, added to the terror which they inspired,
caused them to depreciate, so that they could not
be sold at any price. To keep up a force for the
defense of the frontier large sums were required,
and necessity compelled us to make paper issues.
Having no means to redeem this paper, its price,
as amatter of course,wentdown,and itdescended
in the scale until much of it commanded but ten
cents in the dollar. That paper constitutes the
very debt in controversy, and is now here demand-
ing its full face value, with eight and ten per cent,
interest.
by its title, and referred to the Committee on
Commerce.
The bill from the House for the relief of Charles
Lee Jones, was read a first and second time by its
title, and referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Mr. MASON. I now move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Executive busi-
ness.
Mr. HUNTER. I wish to state that the Com-
mittee on Finance have reported the civil and
diplomatic appropriation bill, and we are now
ready to proceed with its consideration. It is
not my purpose to oppose my colleague's motion
to-day, but 1 give notice that to-morrow I shall
ask the Senate to divide the time, at least with
him. Unless we can dispose of that bill this
week, I do not well see how we are to adjourn
on the 4th of August. I hope, sir, that to-morrow
the Senate will agree to take it up and proceed
with it. It is a very long bill. I give notice that
I shall ask the Senate to-morrow to take it up.
Mr.^ GWIN. I hope we shall take up the
homestead bill. We have spent day after day
upon it, and we are now ready to come to a vote.
Mr. PRATT. There is no chance of getting a
vote upon that now.
Mr. MASON. The Senator from California
will allow me to say to him, and to the Senate,
that they are aware that there is important busi-
ness pending before the Senate, m Executive ses-
sion, business of very great importance. *The ses-
sion is drawing near to a close; and, therefore, I
shall be compelled to ask the Senate to proceed to
the consideration of Executive business.
Mr. GWIN. I am m favor of it; but I want
to do one thing at a time. I want to get clear of
the homestead bill now; and therefore, I hope we
shall proceed to its consideration and get through
with it.
Mr. CLAY. I will say to the Senator from
California, that it is utterly impossible to get
through with that bill to-day. I have several
amendments which I shall propose to it at the
proper time.
Mr. GWIN. We have to dispose of it; and
as we have it under consideration, I am opposed
to laying it aside for anything until it is disposed
of. Therefore, I ask for the yeas and nays on the
motion of the Senator from Virginia, with a view
to vote against it in order to take up the home-
stead bill.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. CLAYTON. I do hope that we shall do
something. We have now two measures be-
fore us of great importance—the homestead bill,
and the Texas debt bill.
Now, the fact is found to be that, when we
partially discuss a bill, and then postpone it to
another day, it increases debate upon it from day
to day. The only proper way to proceed, is to
take up some one subject and go through with it,
before we proceed with anything else.
If we begin with the homestead bill, and then
the next day take up the Texas debt bill, and in
the middle of the discussion on thatgo into Execu-
tive session to take up*some treaty,the result will
be that the Senate will adjourn without action on
some of the most important measures. I am not
opposed to going into Executive session; but I do
hope that now we shall proceed to decide either
the homestead bill or the Texas debt bill.
Mr. BELL. I wish to ask the honorable chair-
man of the Committee on Foreign Relations, if
he stated that it was a matterof immediate import-
ance that we should go into Executive session ?
Mr. MASON. I will state to the Senator, and
to the Senate, that there is a matter pending before
the Senate in Executive session of great public
interest and great public importance. It is indis-
pensable, I think, to the success of that measure
that it should be acted upon within the present
session, it may be that it will elicit a good deal
of difference of opinion, and a good deal of debate,
and it may require time.
I gave notice that I should move an Executive
session on Monday, but at the solicitation of gen-
tlemen interested m the homestead bill, I deferred
if until I have found, as I am now satisfied, that
if that homestead bill be continued it will take up
the lemamder of the session, forihere will be pro-
tracted debate upon it, and various amendments
