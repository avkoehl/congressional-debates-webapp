notj wi truth ,know at which of the two baits we were to nibble'
[Laughter } Does his hand hold either? Who knows?—and
how is his oracuiat wilfto be ascertained'? If crying injustice
was ever done to a budy of men in the world, tbe^e charges
against as of factious opposition and personal enmity to the
3Pi6aider.it are thecruelestand most unfounded examples of it
On one branch of our public affairs the Oracle 1 say has
«poten at last—and atavery proper time—juBtm the muitfeof
a subject bice that before us—anil when the House ha<; just dis
posed of the leading question involved in it Ay, while we arc
♦ngaged on a measure of finance, the peculiar friends of the
President brings ua in an amendment to repeal the land bill,
and his amendment is voted down What nex 1 On the very
next day we are told by the President that we mustdo this very
thing Why is this? If we are indeed bound as a i ongress to
follow in all things the will of the Executive, why was the ex-
pression of that will withheld till we have chosen a course of
our own directly the reverse and then suddenly brought for-
ward that we may be whipped back, and the serví e chain of
unquestioning subserviency is bound on our free limbs'? Yes—
and insult is added We must not only submit to wear a
chain, but we must hold it up to publie view, and clank our
fetters that all the world may hear '—so that there shall remain
no doubt on any man's mm i that, on the greatest measure
ever submitted, the JNational Legislature is perfectly and abso
lute!? subservient to the President's revealed good pleasure
To what does all this lead? Why all this obscurity, thi3 un
certainty, thrown over the wishes of the President lor a time,
till we have received and acted on the recommendations of his
Secretary, and then those recommendations are here openly
repudiated by one of his peculiar friends, and weight after
weight thrown on its progress through the House, and then, as
soon as we have acted, are we thus ebnked' Could any thing
have been mpie artfully designed to make the Legislature un
popular, and present a major ty of its measures openly dis
graced, degraded, shamed before theeyesof the people?
He has spoken1 Yes, and what has he said1 It behooves
us to listen, and to give a true interpretation to his words, if such
a thing be possible What has he said? He has told us that
an act, passeo. under his own express recommendation, distri
buting amosg ti e States the avails of the public lands, must be
repealed That, because we lie under a debt of seventeen mil
jions, there is no other resource to escape from our embarras*
mentsbutby taking this back fiom the States Wh le pots
sesaed of the whole revenue power with which the Const union
has clothed us, and of which it has in the same bi eath divested
the Sates, we have no other earthly means to sustain American
credit mthe eyes of the world, than to lake away from the
States the lands which are their own, and which by a tardy act
of justice we have just restored to them Yes, the selfsame
nation, who, with a population of but three million'1', with us
commerce bioken ip—without a Government—poor, naken,
"Without allies, save us own indomitable courage and Heaven to
smile upon it-contidUeda debtof a hundred miIiions,and fur led
it who hadabodyofland smrendeiea to the Union of its States,
on condition that it should be a fund from which the deb 3 of
the States were to be paid and its credit restored, and which
paid that debt a nation whi^h twenty five years auer, con
trasted, at the call of the nation il honor, anothei debtofanun-
dred and twenty milliors, and paid that too this same nation
now laboring under the enormous the crushing debt, of seven
teen millions—aftei shuffling off all action m promoting mtei
rial improvements, and shifting th.it upon the shouldeis. of the
States—this nation has now no means to raise enough revenue
to pay off these seventeen millions, expended as they have, in
pait, been for national objects, which are the very sinews of our
defence' No With all oui legitimate and most profitable
sources of revenue untouched, we cannot raise these seventeen
million", but must snatch fiom the mouths of the States the
residuum of that ceceitly íestored inheritance which they per
mitted us to enjoy long ->ner the original objects of the gian„
had been more thmtulfilled' \nd weare cu led to do thus by
a State Rights President* And if we do not comply, we
axe then to be denounced as ac iog fiom factious pi nciples
and a desne aid design to 'head Captain 1 ylei ' And
the friend*  of the Presided expect to bp able to bolster him
tip, and get a party to place him a second, 01 rather for the
first, time in the chair of stae, by disgrac ng and degrading

X spoke something of the unhappy divisions of the Whig par
ty, Executive and Legislative and I said that there was but one
subjecton which 1 evei would consent to practice decep ion
on the people     Tnese unhappy divisions 1 would   if I could,

Another of our great and leading measures was (he land bill,
and just as the indebted States are expecting a rich blessing in
their state of embarrassment from its benehcent provisions, we
are called upon to undo our own work and nulliiy our own
lavorite meas ire What are the advantages which that mea
sure would secure, bu* which we are new called upon to loret
go'* I hold m my hand a document m which those advantages
^are soadmiidbly set forth,thailmay be patdoned for quoting
its eloquent language and employing it ins ead oí my own It
is a speech delivered, if 1 mistake not, at a place, somewhere
in Vagmia, called Louisa, and in it we uieto d that oid \n
guita who ceded to her sister States a territory far °reater than
the extent of her own boundaries, is, through the precious
blessings of Mr Clav's land bill, to Le at length remunerated
for her generous magnanimity
[Mr M here quoted pretty largely from a speech of Mr
Wise hi which he speaks in very exalted terms of the land
bill and its author    The reading elicited many smiles ]
This was in '39 the Vugmia doctrine—the Whig Virginia
doctrine, at least if we may receive as authonty the words of
one who was at that time himself good evidence ol what a
Vuginia Whig mea t But now, so strangely have the Ooc
trines of o d Vuginia—ay, of old Whig Virginia—changed, that
heie we see a Virginia Whig s andmg up on this floor, and
pieaching to us that, of all the Whig measures, ihis land bill,
which be says is really no Whig measure at all, is the most
execrable andabominable' feu re y, surely, the gentleman, who
has'for days together been thunceiing forth anathemas agair st
this measure, could never, in his extensive reading on eonsti
tutiona! law, have met with this document tievei could he
have conceived, suiely that such doctrines as ate here avowed
were ever held n old Vngn id by Whigs—ay, and by a iyler
Whig ' [laughter ] Does the eloquent gentleman fiom Aceo
mac recollect this language? Does he ask who c mid have been
bO recreant to the doctrines of'ííü so far irom ail abstractionism,
as to put feith heresy like this? If he does, then I shall have
occasion, once more tosaytohirr as I did on a foimer occa-
sion, in the wordsofNathan to David, "Thou art the man' '
But how does all this happen? how is it to be explained''
These chaises from the quarter an 1 under the circumstances
m which they are urged, become mat ers of mighty moment
Has the state ol things, and have the principles in which we
came into power, changed? líave the relations of this land
changed"1 Has the Whig party changed] Has the great
man who is the author of this land b 11 changed] No not
at all And are we then to be charged with having abandon
ed the true faith, from eui hostility towards a particular man'*
Ah,su' if we have changed our ground, ah, ¡>u' if we had
been found denouncing publicly, andpe? se, the President oí the
United States, and if we, from the beginning of the extra ses
sion, had denounced him and all he did, and then had abandon
