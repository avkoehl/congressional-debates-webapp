Immediately upon receiving a report that General Warren had connected with General Hancock I returned to my headquarters. Soon after i left the enemy moved out across Hatcher's Run, in the gap between Generals Hancock and Warren, which was not closed as reported, and made a desperate attack on General Hancock's right and rear. General Hancock immediately faced his corps to meet it, and after bloody combat drove the enemy with in his works, and withdrew that night to his old position. In support of this movement General Butler made a demonstration on the north side of the James, and attacked the enemy on the Williamsburg road and also on the York River Railroad. In the former hew as un successful; in the later he succeeded in carrying a work which was after ward abandoned, and his forces withdrawn to their former positions.

From this time forward the operations in front to Petersburg and Richmond, until the spring campaign of 1865, were confined to the defense and extension of our line sand to offensive movements for crippling the enemy's lines of communication and to prevent his detaching any considerable force to send south. * By the 7th of February our lines were extended to Hatcher's Run, and the Weldon railroad had be en destroyed to Hicksford.

General Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the 6th of may, with the Armies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, commanded, respectively, by Generals Thomas, McPherson, and Schofield, upon Johnston's army at Dalton; but finding the enemy's positions at Buzzard Roost, covering Dalton, too strong to be assaulted, General McPherson was sent though Snake [Creek] Gap to turn it, while Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened it in front and on the north. This movement was successful. Johnston, finding his retreat likely to be cut off, fell back to his fortified position at Resaca, wehre he was attacked on the after noon of May 15. A heavy battle en sued. During the night the enemy retreated south. Late on the 17th, his rear guard was over taken near Adairsville, and heavy skirmishing followed. The next morning, however, he had again disappeared. He was vigorously our sued and was over taken at Cassville on the 19th, but, during the ensuing night, retreat ed across the Etowah. While these operations were going on, General Jefferson C. Davis' division of Thomas' army was sent to Rome, capturing it with its forts and artillery and its valuable mill sand foundries. General Sherman having given his army a few days' rest at his point, again put it in motion on the 23rd for Dallas, with a view of turning the difficult pass at Allatoona. On the afternoon of the 25th, the advance, under General Hooker, had a severe battle with the enemy, driving him back to New Hope Church, near Dallas. Several sharpen counter occurred at this point. The most important was on the 28th, when the enemy assaulted General McPherson at Dallas, but received at arable and bloody repulse.

On the 4th of June, Johnston abandoned his entrenched position at New Hope Church and retreated to the strong positions of Kenesaw, Pine, and Lost Mountains. He was forced to yield the two last-named places and concentrate his army on Kenesaw, wehre, on the 27th, Generals Thomas and McPherson made a determined but un successful assault.
