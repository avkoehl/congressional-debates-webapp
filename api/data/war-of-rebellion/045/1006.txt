By command of the Secretary of War:

JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE, July 15, 1863.

Brigadier General R. H. CHILTON,Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Army of Northern Virginia:

GENERAL: I have the honor to represent to the commanding general the fact that in consequence of casualties, detached service, sickness, &c., my command is reduced to less than 300 men.

I consider it injustice to myself and the service to remain longer in my present position. Three regiments of my brigade were left in North Carolina, and are now actively engaged there and upon the Peninsula. I volunteered to accompany the two regiments ordered to Virginia, but, since their reduction, I think my services would be of more avail elsewhere.

I therefore respectfully request authority to rejoin my brigade, or else that I be assigned to a command commensurate with my rank.

B. H. ROBERTSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding, &c.
