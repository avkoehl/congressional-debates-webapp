COLUMBIA, July 29, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I am reliably informed that guerrilla parties, numbering in all about 300, are organized and preparing for some movement in the western portion of this and Hickman Counties. We attempted to surprise a small party of 15 within 4 miles of this yesterday, but failed to over-take them.

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

Send couriers to-night to try and find General Johnson, commanding cavalry. He is supposed to be between Reynolds' and Murfreesborough. Tell him that Forrest is said to be again at Lebanon, and that he must move promptly to Murfreesborough and operate against him.

Major SIDELL, Nashville:

JAMES B. FRY,

Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, July 29, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Your dispatch asking about the release of Colonel Campbell from arrest came so quickly after I had sent a dispatch to you stating that charges had been preferred against him that I am in doubt of your having received my second dispatch. It was, however, that the charges to which I refer are for offenses committed very lately. In answer to yours I transcribe what follows, being a dispatch from the Secretary of War.*

W. H. SIDELL.
