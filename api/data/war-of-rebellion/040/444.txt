Brigadier-General KELLEY,

New Creek, Va.:

The following just received:

WHEELING, VA., May 7.

The rebels are destroying the Northwestern Virginia Railroad west of Clarksbut, and are now moving toward Parkersburg. At last advices they were west of West Union. A sufficient number of troops must be assembled at once, or West Virginia will be overrun. I would respectfully suggest that General Kelley be assigned to the direction of affairs in this quarter as soon as possible.

WILLIAM F. BARRY,

Brigadier-General.

The general commanding has taken the same view that General Barry has. He directs that you proceed with as little delay as possible to Grafton, to take command in person. Much must be left to your discretion when you arrive there, to ascertain the exact positions and strength of the enemy, to defend the railroad and country, and to pursue as far as practicable in the direction of Parkersburg. He desires that you will report our forces and their strength at all the different points west of New Creek.
