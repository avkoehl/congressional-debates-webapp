to throw out skirmishers. I then sent a section of Company G, Second Missouri Artillery, under command of Captain Arthur, forward on the Hernando road, with the detachment of various regiments, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Sidwell, One hundred and eighth Illinois Infantry, as a support, and the Fortieth Wisconsin Infantry forward as a reserve. While I was advancing I received an order from Brigadier-General Buckland in person to withdraw the troops, fearing that the enemy might get on our left. I then fell back about half a mile on the Hernando road and remained there until about 1 p. m., when I received orders to return to camp.

I have every reason to believe that the firing of Company G, Second Missouri Artillery, was very effective, and I consider them to be a very fine organization. All the troops behaved well. I did not see in a single instance anything like cowardice. All of my staff (including Lieutenant Dachsel, Company G, First Illinois Artillery, who was acting as side) were with me during the entire engagement and rendered very effective service.

Below please find a list of casualties. *

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B HOGE,

Colonel, Commanding.
