Major-General ORD,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

I shall leave here to-morrow, to be absent several days. I wish you to return to your headquarters in the field, so that in case of necessity you will be on hand to take charge of armies operating from here. It will answer if you start up in the morning.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS:

I shall know shortly from the commander of the Onondage if the enemy's boats have yet reached the obstructions. They may be waiting for daylight to pass them.

Five 100-pounder Parrott guns were sent last night to be planted on the south side of the James River at places previously prepared for them. General Abbot had the matter in charge.
