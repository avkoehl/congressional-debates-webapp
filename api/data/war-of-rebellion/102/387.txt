to collect them at any designated point. I would therefore recommend that Wittsburg, on the Saint Francis River, and Jacksonport, on White River, be designated as the points of rendezvous for him to collect his forces for parole. These two points can be reached by steamers. It will be impossible to collect but few at this point. Does this arrangement meet with your approval? Answer immediately.

Lieutenant Colonel C. W. DAVIS,

Lieutenant General Dick Taylor has surrendered all the forces under his command to General Canby, so that all Confederate forces east of the Mississippi River have surrendered on the Grant-Lee terms.

Lieutenant Colonel C. W. DAVIS,

Chalk Bluff:

You can select such points as you may deem best, as it seems to me that he can get his officers together at most any place to sign paroles for the men, and we can deliver the paroles to the officers to be delivered to the men. If they desire, however, to collect them at the points designated it will suit us. Have the rolls signed in duplicate, each officer signing for his command.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Colonel HARDING:

It is reported that Henry Taylor's command of bushwhackers have broken up into small squads and scattered. The balance are working north. They crossed the Osage near Papinsville and Grand River on the east line of Bates County. Colonel Blair's troops followed their trail that far. They claimed to be Shelby's men, and committed few depredations, seeming to be anxious to get through the country as quietly as possible.
