HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,Harris' House, May 19, 1864.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: Yours received. It has taken some time to ascertain the enemy's position. It appears from what the prisoners state that one division of Ewell's corps is here, having crossed the river. Birney is on the right. The relief of Tyler will throw Kitching's troops in his place. I am supporting and covering our left. The enemy are working around our right. He has commenced cutting a road through to the Spotsylvania road. The artillery troops are out of ammunition, having fired principally at nothing. I am pushing out on the left to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy on that flank. Will you send to the Harris house some caliber 58 for the Artillery Brigade. I assumed command when I arrived on the ground, and have withdrawn the battery to the hill. The enemy, I think, are making for the main road. I will, without doubt, renew the attack to-morrow. Some additional troops should be sent.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General CUTLER,

Commanding Fourth Division, Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: General Warren thinks your picket-line may be farther to the front than Colonel Kitching's, and if so your picket-line should connect with his. I will notify Colonel Kitching of this, so that he can see it attended to.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. MARVIN, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

We have found the trouble and will soon have it right.
