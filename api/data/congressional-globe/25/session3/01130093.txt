SPATS  TOR REPORTERS.
The Senate took up in its older the report of
the Com mttee on the Contingent Fund, to which
had been íefened the ] etition of the íeporteis of
distant papéis, isk n  th itaccommod uionsmight
be provided fir them eitliei within the Chamber
or m the galleries of tin Serate, th ícport con-
cluding with a resolution providing tint the front
seats of the easter i gallery be set apart for ie
poite's
The leooitarl resolution hav ig been read,
Mi   KING- wish d to know wheineritwa    he
object of the co nmittee who presen ed the lepoit
that the rule heretofore adopted by the Senate
should be changed, and thai the reporters -who
were admitted by that rule to seats on the floor of
the Senate should also be sent to thegalleiy We
have already six oi seven gentlemen engaged m
reporting the m ceednigs f the newspapers of
the District, whether loircetly or othciw,se he
would not say, but he was not disposed so to ex
tend this privilege as to give reporters the whole
fiont of the gallery This would exclude many
honestand respectable citizens, who were desirous
of witnessing our proceedings They might, to
be sure, put up a box or two for those letter-
writers, as he supposed them to be, who repre-
sented things m their own way, but he objected
to appiopriatmg so large a space for their accom-
modation He hoped the resolution would be suf-
feied to he on the table
Mr KNIGHT explained the grounds on which
the commitü e were induced to make this report;
but he spoke in so low a tone that it was impos-
sible foi the repoiters to hear him
Mr NILES moved that the resolution be post-
poned indefinitely He was somewhat suipused
at a pioposmon that that body should sanction,
and in some manner indorse, the vile slandeis that
issued daily from these lettei-wnteis, by assign-
ing them seats within the Chamber. Who were
those persons who styled themselves reporters'
Why,miseiableslandeieis—hirelings,hanging on
to the sknts of lite ratine, earning a miserable sub-
sistence fiom their vile and duty misreptesenta-
tions of the proceedings here, and many of them
writing for both sides As ins term of service
was about to expire, he could speak disinterest-
edly on the subject Perhaps no member of that
body had been more misiepresented and canca-
tuied than himself by those venal and piofligate
scribblers, who were sent on heie to cam a dis
reputable living by catering for the depraved ap-
petite of the papers they wiote for Shall we
sanction such miserable caricatures of the pro-
ceed ings of this body as ai c daily sent abroad by
these hnehngs, and thus give cuuency to them'
for then vile Uash goes out to the world in ad-
vance of the repoitsof the íegulariepoiteis' No
Were he not unwilling to do any act that might
be supposed to interfeit, in the slightest degiee,
with the fieedom of the piess, he would move
some íesolution to prevent their coming within
the walls of the body at all As it wis, let them
take their seats in the galleries, and write what
they pleased, without asking foi the sanction of
the Senate, foi he would not consent, for then ac-
commodation, to exclude the honest and respect-
able citizens who came he,e as spectatois
Mi PRESTON said we had already admitted
reporters under a rule of the Senate, but this was
a monopoly of the local presses, and he knew no
reason why they should have a special right of
admission He was m favor of the adoption of
this i solution, and onposed to any monopoly m
the matter He was aware that highly eoloied,*
and in many instances vituperative, letteis had
gone forth fiom this city, and were published and
circulated bv the party pipsses of the country.
We may, perhaps, nl feel that we have more or
less cause ot complaint against tht se letter-wri-
ters, and he thought that the conduct of no mem
ber cf the Senate hrd b<en more frequently or
gieatly misicpiesented than his own, yet this
was one ot the evils of a fue, and even hcen-
tirnspiiss and he was for bearing the ills in-
ihcted on htm personally, for what he dtemed a
greater r ublie good We have lepoi leis heie foi
papéis of both parties, and am >ng them t1 e le-
poiteis for a paper that would oi tin list to say
anything to thedisaov intige of the Senator fiom
Connecticut, oi give him t e lc i^t cause oi com-
plaint Since the adoption ot th< iule by the
benate, ho had seen but \ sinslc cd toi of one of

than jus ice to the gentlemen connected with the
press of the ct untrj , of whom it m ly be said
that it is better to have tl cu idvoiable leport
