DENVER, COLO. TER., June 18, 1864.

Colonel J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Commanding Dist. of Colorado, Fort Lyon, Colo. Ter.:

COLONEL: The high water on Cache la Poundre has prevented my arrival here until the present time, and upon examination find my ordnance department in the worst disorder. Captain Robbins on arrival will inform you, if you have not already hear, of the panic and excitement created by the report of Indians advancing on Denver, the mob breaking for the ordnance store-room in a body, demanding the issue of arms, ammunition, &amp;c., which Morgan would not do until ordered by Captain Wanless to open and issued to them; the mob at the same time threatening to tear down the building if not supplied. So soon as the doer was opened they crowded in, and quite a number helped themselves. Of some of the issued I find memorandum receipts. i will endeavor to have returned all ordnance taken or issued as soon as possible. The Governor, as near as I can find out, will probably become responsible for the missing property. In this state of things it will be impossible for me to report at Fort Lyon at present, uncles you desire it so. As soon as I can straighten matters here I will leave and join you, if then required.

I remain, colonel, very respectfully,

CHARLES C. HAWLEY,

First Lieutenant, Ordnance Officer, Dist. of Colorado.
