Major BOND,

Aide-de-Camp:

The general's order to abandon the line to Wauhatchie reached me last evening, and I am so far on the way to General Crittenden's headquarters, where an office will be opened early in the morning. I am suffering under an attack of dysentery, and cannot for some hours obey the order to report in person, but will do so at the earliest moment possible. I hope to be able to keep the saddle in a few hours. The office at this point will be maintained until that at General Crittenden's is opened.

Very respectfully,yours,

J. C. VAN DUZER,

Superintendent of Telegraph.
