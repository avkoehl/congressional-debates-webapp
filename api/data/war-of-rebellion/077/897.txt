Near Jonesborough, Tenn.
HEADQUARTERS MORGAN'S BRIGADE,November 11, 1864.

GENERAL: I have advanced the line as you directed. Some cattle were disturbed by the movement and driven toward the enemy, which drew a fire from his pickets. I supposed them to be about 400 yards from my vedettes. The men are suffering exceedingly from cold, and I wish that I may be relieved for a short time by some of the troops in the rear, and permitted to fall back to where I can build fires. I can resume my present position in time for the attack. The number of fires on the enemy's line is increasing. I heard firing a few minutes since, apparently in the rear of the gap.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. W. DUKE,

Brigadier-General.
