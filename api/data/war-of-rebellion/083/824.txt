Numbers 3. Report of Captain Dudley C. Wyman, Eleventh Wisconsin Infantry.

BRASHEAR CITY, October 1, 1864.

SIR: In pursuance of orders I went on board Gun-boat 43,with my command, at 4 o'clock on the evening of the 26th of September. My command consisted of a detachment of the left wing of the Eleventh Wisconsin, in all seventy-five men. We lay at anchor in the bay until 3 o'clock on the morning of the 27th, when we steamed up to Flat lake. From Flat Lake we entered Bayou Long and proceeded without incident to its junction with Belle River. We found no difficulty in navigating Belle River, and reached Bayou Gotvelle in safety. Entering Bayou gotvelle great difficulty was experienced from the short bends and narrowness of the bayou. I succeeded in penetrating to within three miles of Lake Natchez, where the bayou, becoming very narrow, I lay to and proceeded with eight men, in a small boat, to the lake. I found the bayou narrow, the bends short, and the bayou overhung with trees; so much so that navigation was impossible for a boat over 100 feet long. As it was past 12 o'clock, and knowing I could not form a junction, as ordered, I concluded to return. Returning several miles, we lay over all night and started for Brashear on the morning of the 28th, where we arrived at 8.30 a. m., when I dismissed my command. Bayou Long and Belle River are large, wide streams, navigable for gun-boats.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. WYMAN,

Captain Company G, Eleventh Wisconsin.
