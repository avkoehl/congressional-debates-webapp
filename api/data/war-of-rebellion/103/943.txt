Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Macon, Ga.:

(Care General Cobb.)

The following, addressed to the general, just received:

MERIDIAN, January 30, 1865.

Sherman's movements render a victory necessary to us at once, and it will require all our means to insure it. I can resist a raid without Stewart's corps, and cannot fight a battle with it against an army, and French's division is very weak, but will enable me to fully garrison Mobile and Choctaw Bluff. The remainder of the corps should go east at once to insure success there. We can thus save Lee's communications, raise the siege of Mobile, should it be invested, or be prepared to meet Thomas when he advances in the spring. Last of Cheatham's corps, except furloughed men, will leave here on Wednesday. I find upon inquiry that his Tennessee division has been furloughed until 10th, and Brantly's and Sharp's brigades until 12th proximo. Will report further about artillery.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., January 30, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Macon, Ga.:

(Care of General Cobb.)

General Taylor, fearing that the taking of arms from the troops will increase straggling, desires to know if the arms now in Augusta destined for his department cannot be promptly transported to Meridian.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., January 30, 1865.

Colonel E. J. HARVIE,

Pollard, Ala.:

Trains have been ordered for the troops. Instruct officer at Mobile or Pollard to notify Major E. H. Harris, at this place, of the starting and expected arrival of troops.

J. B. EUSTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WEST POINT, MISS., January 30, 1865.

Lieutenant-General TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

General Hood's order Numbers 1 allows up furlough this side of the Mississippi River to exceed thirty days. I have two North Carolina regiments. It will take them fifteen to eighteen days to go and return. Allowing them ten days at home, their furloughs must vary from forty to forty-six days. Shall I make an exception in their cases to the order?

ALEX. P. STEWART,

Lieutenant-General.
