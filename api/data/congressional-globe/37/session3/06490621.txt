1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL G-LOBE.
that great State lying in the center of the conti-
nent, would speak the word, " we are on this side
in this great contest; we are on the side of free-
dom, free men, and free labor," it would be worth
$10,000,000 to have the word spoken, and to have
it spoken now, and to place that State on the side
of the Government of the country. Therefore,
sir, I should with the greatest pleasure vote for
this bill as it came from the House of Represent-
atives. I would prefer to have the smallest sum
and the longest time. That will be cheapest to
the Government; it best comports with the con-
dition of the Treasury; and moreover, gradual
emancipation on the whole, I am inclined to think,
is most in harmony with the interests of that State.
Such a measure as that, as a general measure for
emancipation, must be most in harmony with any
policy which could be inaugurated. But, sir, it
is evident enough that the honorable Senator from
Missouri, who takes so large an interest in this
measure, feels that the other alternative of this
proposition is necessary. It may be that it will
be found necessary, to accommodate ourselves to
the wishes and purposes of Missouri, that she
should have the $20,000,000. It may be that the
Legislature would prefer that, and it may be that
the whole proposition will fail unless we give that
alternative. I think the honorable Senator from
Missouri so understands it, so feels it. If I thought
it were so, I certainly should not withhold the
vote. I should be very much inclined to follow
himinthateven. lam sure that twelve monthsago
all of us would gladly have given the $20,0007000
■ to Missouri for a pledge that she would make her
soil free in 1865. If it were necessary, 1 certainly
would not be disposed to withhold a vote from
that proposition at the present time.
I have, Mr.President, said all that I desired to
say in rising, simply to explain the vote I feel
called upon to give; and I should not have felt it
necessary to say this much if there had not been
so great a contrariety in the opinions of Senators
as expressed on both sides of the Chamber.
Mr. LATHAM. I move that the Senate ad-
journ.
Mr. GRIMES called for the yeas and nays, and
they were ordered.
Mr. DIXON. Before the vote is taken I wish
to state that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr.
Ten Eycic] has been called home by intelligence
of the sickness of a relative.
The question being taken by yeas and nays, re-
sulted—yeas 12, nays 28; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Hicks, Kennedy, Latham, McDougall,
Nesmith, Powell, ltiee, Richardson, Saulsbury, Tuipic,
Wall, ami Wilson of Missouri—12.
NAYS—Messrs. Anthony, Arnold, Clark, Collamer, Dix-
on, Doolittle, Fessendeu, Foot, Foster, Giunes, Harding,
Harlan, Hams, Henderson, Howard, Howe, Kin , Lane
of Indiana, Lam; of Kansas. Morrill, Pomcioy, Sherman,
Sumner, Tiumbuli, Wade, Wilkinson, Wllley, and Wil-
son of Massachusetts—28.
So the Senate refused to adjourn.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
recurs on the amendment of the Senator fiom
Missouri, to strike out " seventy-six"and insert
" eighty-five."
On the question being taken by yeas and nays,
it resulted—yeas 16, nays 22; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Anthony, Arnold, Cowan, Davis Divon,
Doolittle, Harris, Ilcndelsoii, Howe, Lane of Kansas, Mor-
al!, Powell, Richardson, Sherman, Willey, ami Wilson of
Missouri—111.
NAYS—Messrs. Chandler, Clark, Collamer, Fessenden,
"Foot, Foster, Gilmes, Hauling, Harlan, Hicks, Howard,
King, Lane of Indiana, Latham, McDougall, Pcimeroy,
Rice, Sumner, Trumbull, Wade, Wilkinson, and Wilson
of Massachusetts—92.
So the amendment to the amendment was re-
jected.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Sherman
in the chair.) The next amendment proposed by
the Senator from Missouri will be read.
The Secretary read it. In line eleven, section
two, after the word " bonds," to insert the words
"lo an amount not exceeding §10,000,000;" so
that the clause will read:
Cut should it provide foi the termination of slavery at n
date subsequent to that last named, then said bonds, to an
amount not exceeding 410,000,000, shall be delivered iu four
equal installments, &e.
Mr. HENDERSON. Inasmuch as the Senate
has seen fit to retain the time fixed in the bill of
the committee, making emancipation to commence
in a very short period, or to be completed within
a very short period in the State, I shall ask a vote
. on a proposition to insert a higher sum than
§10,000,000 in that particular place. Tho way it
now stands it would give us $20,000,000 to eman-
cipate even by 1876. I wish to move an amend-
ment by inserting there $14,000,000.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
can modify his own amendment.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The amendment alluded
to by the Senator from Missouri, inserting
$10,000,000, I believe, has been already adopted.
Mr. HENDERSON. No, sir.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
has a right to modify his own amendment.
Mr. HOWARD. I hope that the amendment
as modified will be reported.
The Secretary read the amendment as modified;
to insert in section two, line eleven,after the word
"bonds," the words "to an amount not exceed-
ing §14,000,000 in the aggregate;" so that the
clause will read:
But should it provide for the termination of slavery at
a date subsequent to that last named, then said bonds, to an
amount not exceeding $14,000,000 in the aggregate, shall
bo delivered in four equal installments.
Mr. HENDERSON. An amendment has al-
ready been adopted in the seventh line of tho sec-
tion by which it is provided that if the State shall
emancipate in full by the 4th of July, 1865, it
shall receive §20,000,000. As tho committee first
reported the bill, they gave the State $20,000,000,
provided the emancipation was completed by 187G.
I thought it would be preferable to extend the time
to 1885, and to reduce the amount, as a great
many Senators did not like to vote for $20,000,000.
My impression is that emancipation cannot be
effected and completed, under a gradual system,
by 1876, a short period of thirteen years, with
that amount. If, however, the Senate think oth-
erwise, and see fit to adopt §10,000,000, they can
vote down this amendment; but under the vote
of my Legislature, 1 feel that it is my duty to
make this proposition, and to obtain the sense of
the Senate upon it. 1 therefore ask for the yeas
and nays on the amendment.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. GRIMES. There seems to be some slight
controversy as to what the purport of this amend-
ment is. I understand the first proposition is, that
if the State of Missouri shall emancipate her slaves
by 1865 the Governmentofthe United States shall
pay to the State §20,000,000. The proposition
on which we are now about to vote is the prop-
osition of the committee, that if she shall eman-
cipate by 1876 the Government shall pay her
#10,000,000.
Mr, HENDERSON. No, sir; the committee
reported in favor of $20,000,000.
Mr. GRIMES. 1 desire to know whether this
amendment reduces the sum from §20,000,000
to $14,000,000, or raises it from §10,000,000. to
$14,000,000.
Mr. HENDERSON. It reduces the report of
the committee ftom $20,000,000 to $14,000,000.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I thought your amend-
ment was adopted.
Mr. HENDERSON. No, sir. I offered two
amendments, connected together, to extend the
time to 1885 and reduce the amount; one depended
on the other. Inasmuch ns the Senate defeated
the one in regard to the time, I desire to increase
the other as regards the sum.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I really do not understand
it now. The eleventh line lends, " bonds of tho
United States to the amount of $20,000,000." How
does that stand at the present time?
Mr. TRUMBULL. That is stricken out.
Mr. FESSENDEN. What is inserted in place
of it ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. No amount whatever.
Mr. FESSENDEN. How does it read >
Mr. TRUMBULL. That was stricken out on
motion of the Senator fiotn Missouri.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Very well; what is the
present condition of the bill5
Mr. TRUMBULL. The eleventh line now
reads," bondsof the United States,in the manner
hereinafter provided;" and then the Senatorfiom
Missouri proposes that the $20,000,000 shall come
in after the word " bonds," in the eighth line; so
as to read, " the Piesidcnt shall cause bonds to
the amount of £>20,000,U00," &c. I believe that
amendment has been adopted in the eighth line of
the second section.
Mr. HENDERSON. Yes, sir.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Then the Senator from
Missouri proposed further, in case the abolition
of slavery did not take placets soon as 1865, and
that the State of Missouri took more timeythfey
should have but $10,000,000. That amendment
we have not acted upon. Now he proposes Jto
withdraw his amendment for $10,000,000, in
case the emancipation is gradual, and put in
$14,000,000; and that is the question now before
the Senate, whether we shall vote to allow tbetn
$14,000,000 in case they take until 1876 to get rid
of slavery.
Mr. CLARK. I will ask that the section be
reported as it stands.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senator from Mis-
souri proposes these amendments to the second
section of the bill.
Mr. FESSENDEN. How does it come in then?
Mr. CLARK. Let it be read; then we will un-
derstand it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second
section will be read as it will stand if amended as
proposed by the Senator from Missouri, in order
that Senators may understand it.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
And be it further enacted, That in case the law or act of
emancipation to be adopted by said State shall provide for
the lull and perfect manumission of all slaves therein on
or before the 4th day ot July, A. D. 1865, and the future
exclusion of the sjstein of slavery from' the State for-
ever thereafter, the President shall cause the said bonds to
the amount of §50,000,000 to lie prepaied and delivered as
aforesaid immediately on the passage of said act. Hut
should it provide toi the termination of slavery at a date
subsequent to that last named, then said bonds, to an amount
not exceeding §14,000,000 in the aggregate, shall be deliv-
ered iu four equal installments, dated liora the passage of
said act to the tune when slavery shall cease under its pro-
visions.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Docs not the provision
now stand in this way: " said bonds to an amount
not exceeding $10,000,000 in the aggregate?"
Mr. TRUMBULL. It was proposed but not
adopted. The Senator from Missouri has modified
Ins amendment.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I think I can state in a
word just precisely how itstands. The committee
have reported in favor of giving $20,000,000 in
bonds provided slavery shall be abolished in Mis-
souriby 1876. Theyprovidethatifitbeabolished
by 1865 the bonds shall be given all at once on the
passage of the act; and if it be abolished after
1865, tut before 1876, then the bonds are to be de-
livered in four equal installments. That is what
the committee propose. Inasmuch as we have
rejected the proposition to extend the time to 1885
and confined the longest period to 1876, the Sen-
ator from Missouri now proposes, as I understand
his proposition, to stand on the bill as the com-
mittee reported it, issuing§30,000,000 if it is done
by 1865; but he proposes, if it is done after 1865
and before 1876, it shall be reduced to §14,000,000.
I-Ic wants to propose the alternative, and he makes
the proposition even better for the nation than that
which the committee reported. I shall therefore
sustain his proposition.
Mr. HENDERSON. I owe it to myself simply
to state this fact: I did not suppose the Senate
would defeat the other proposition. Of course I
prefer the bill as reported by the committee to the
proposition I now make; but my reason for offer-
ing it and proposing to extend tile time, was that
the Senator fiom Oiiio and other Senators told mo
they wanted gradual emancipation. The Senator
from Massachusetts and others stated to me that
they would not vote for more than §10,000,000. I
so understood them; but 1 am glad to be assured
to-day that I misunderstood what the Senator from
Massachusetts said yesterday on that point. I
then, iu Older to accommodate the bill to the views
of different membeis, desired to extend the time
ill the one case, and lessen the amount of money
appropriated, provided that extended time were
granted. I prefer the bill as it came from the com-
mittee; but inasmuch ns you have voted down the
extension of the time, I make this proposition. If
the Senate will permit the amendment of the com-
mittee to stand as it is, I shall of course prefer it.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to ask the
Senator from Missouri a question. Is not hi%
proposition, in factj two puits of the same thing?
One was that if slavery was abolished by a certain
day in 1865, then the $20,000,000 were to be paid;
and if it extended to a longer period, §10,000,000
were to be paid.
Mr. HENDERSON. If it extended to 1885.
Mr. FESSENDEN. " At a date subsequent
to that last named," it reads here.
