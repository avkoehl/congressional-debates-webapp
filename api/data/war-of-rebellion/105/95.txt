COLONEL: Having no means of getting reliable information from you except by a special express, I send the bearer of this to you for that purpose. He will be able to tell you about this part of the country, and will bring to me any communication you may desire to write. I have a force of light battery (Company A, Third Artillery) of two 12-pounder howitzers and two 6-pounder guns, and fifteen companies of infantry and five companies of cavalry, California Volunteers, well armed and provided for, and the men are as fine material as any in the service. I can move on from Tucson or Fort Breckinridge as soon as I hear from you. I am ready and anxious to co-operate with you. If necessary I can be followed by still another regiment or more of infantry, to be sent by steam to the mouth of the Colorado. It will afford me pleasure to enter into any plan you may suggest, so my force can be of service to you and to the cause. Let me know your strength, your situation, your purposes; the strength, situation, and probable purposes of Sibley and his troops. Please send an escort with my messenger to get him safely through the Apaches.

I have the honor to be, respectfully,

JAMES H. CARLETON,
