CAPTAIN: Immediately upon receipt of the telegram from the major- general commanding, ordering a cavalry reconnaissance down the Chickahominy, a company properly instructed were sent out by me in the direction of Long Bridge and are now absent. Small parties were dispatched this morning at an early hour upon the roads to my left. One of them, under charge of Captain Keenan, accompanied by Lieutenant West, of my staff, has just returned. They proceeded a distance of about 2 miles on the Charles City road in a westerly direction, then, turning to the left, followed the Quaker road, so called, a distance of about 6 miles, to within sight of James River, Nothing unusual was detected. Captain Smyth, in charge of another party, fell in with the enemys mounted pickets about 8 oclock this morning on a road running par- allel with James River, and was fired upon. This point is a regular picket post of the enemy, who seems to have men there to observe and report the movements of our gunboats. I will take the liberty to re- mark that in my opinion it is a dereliction of duty on the part of the gunboats to permit the enemys pickets to skirt the shores of the river and his forces to lie quietly encamped within range of their guns. I am about sending a detachment under Captain Keenan, in whose prudence and energy I place confidence, directly across the country to the river. He will soon be able to ascertain whether a force has passed or is passing. I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant, SILAS CASEY, Brigadier- General Volunteers, Commanding Division. Capt.

I am at a loss to conjecture what has detained him. His instructions were to return last evening. I was informed by a small boy who has been living with Mr. Toler, but at this time em- ployed by a sutler, that Mr. Tolers daughter, a young lady, was corre
