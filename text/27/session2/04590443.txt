EVERETT, andTJELINGHAST, sustaining the decision ot the
Chair, and Mr CHARLES BROWN opposing it
After which Mr Brown withdiew the appeal
The question then recurring on the amendment of Mr Ath
erton—
Mr. ATHERTON observed that the gentleman fiom Ken-
tucky piofessed that hia object was to do equal and exact ]u*>
tice to all the Slates, and toallpoittonsof the Confederacy He
confessed that he thought the ratio pioposed by the gentleman
was very far from ob'amingthat object It would requne but
a very few woids to show that ° reit injustice wo aid be done by it
to many of the smaller States, and pai ucular'y to the New I pg
laud States Mr A then stated the amount of the hea y
fractions that would be hit unrepi esented in each of the New
England States, (204,850 in the wnole,) while New York which
would have more Repte^entatives than ail the New England
States combined, would have but a tuning fraction Aftei
commenting on the inequality of the rati _> pioposed by Mr Un
dbbwood, Mr A said he would brief!j reply to the remuksof
the gentleman in relauouto the sizeof the House Thisiíoiue,
Mr A said, embodied the Democratic principle in the Govern
ment, anditwasunpoitant that thai pimciple s iou!d be pre
served in its sreatest purity The reason foi establish nga rep
resentative Government was, because the whole people could
not assemble and determine for themselves what measures
shall be adopted foi then benefit, and it therefoie became neces
saiy to appoint agents to cany out then wishes- A represent-
ative Government was, thereioie the people acting through
then agen's, and hence it wasimpoitant thattheie should be
the freest and fullest repiesentation ¡Something had bten said
yesterday m relation to the equal repiesentation of the small
States in the Senate, and it was contended that, with thi^equal
ity in that body, injustice could not be done them Buttlus-had
nothing to do with the question heie, font mustbe recollected
that the membeis of the ¡senate lepresented the State sovereum
ty, y>hile this House was alone to beconsideiedas the embodi-
ment of the Democratic pi mciple in the Government The gen
tleman fiom Virginia, [Mr WisE,]m hi3digument in support
of a large ratio and small íepiesentation contended that a 1 ugp
body would be liable to confusion and d soider m their pi >
ceeehngs, would bo tardy and inefficient in ihen legi lation,
and would not posse«qas much dignity and elevation of char
acteras a small one Ihxre was an i (consistency m one pevrt
of the gentleman's argument, that wasappaienton its face It
was this That while a small body would be nure píTic eni m
this House a large constituent would be al&o moie eificie it, and
send bettei agents, and that the people w mid act bettei ml t^e
numbeis, while then agents wiul 1 act bcittei m ^mall numbeis
Mr A difTeri 1 entirely with the gentlen an lie did not be
lieve that ab'er oi more efficient men would be sent here fn<n
havmgasmai er number ol then Win did not believe that
another House of Representatives, equal m^z to Un1*,aided
equal talent and efficiency, could be elected tomorrow'1 It
seemed to him, however, that the argument proceedel ot a
wrong assumption It assumed that the country was to
be governed by the wisdom of its Representatives n Congiesd
acting perse, and not by the wisdom of Jie people
According to our theory of government, the House of Rep
resentatives is the agent by which the people expíes their will,
and its acts are the acts of the people, through th°ir Repre&en'a
tives The argument of the gentleman from Virginia might,
with equal propnety, be u el to show that it would be better to
keep the Repi esentatives entirely aloof fiom then constituents
and to make the teitn of then seivice here so lor g that they
would be free 1 from their influence Tt seemed to him that to
this extent the argument went Now all writeis on popu ar
Governments concuued in saying that a fteqaent return of
elections infused new vigoi m Dcmociaüc Governments and
was essential to the pre-eivation of popular rights. The chai
acterof the Hou^ealso was improved by having memben- ft esh
from the people, who weie usually moie aident, more ?Qalou<=,
and efficient m canymg out measures of lelorm than many of
those whose long contnuaocp hete hal rendeied th^m less
watchful of abuses One of he gen Ien.au3b ohiectionw io a
large boJy wa>, that it would be tudy and inefficient jn \es,i-=
lation, but Mi A did í ot look upon th s a  an evil Out. of
the greatest blessings of a Republican Go\einment was that
measuresofadou&tíui chaiaciei coul i not b-1 hurtled thiou3h,
to the injury of the people A large body of RepiesenUtives
would always act promptly enough when th°y rid the f ubiic
sentiment with them, and it was only when it was douitfnl
whether the people lavored cei am measures that there wa&
difficulty in parsing them
Mr A then combatted the argument that a large Housp
ofRepresentaüves would be Inbieto divider and confusion,
and contended that it was not warranted by expenence, and
that a House of thiee hun-hed membeis would beas ordeil/
and as efficient at> a^naller one and aa piompt in legislation
as the good of the country required
Mr REYNOLD  argued at some length in fivor of uch a
ratio as would enable the State of II mote to swao a fiaction of
fifty two thousand foi a member, and spoke s rm gly on the
propnety of districting the Mates throughout the Umoi
Mr BRIGGS moved to amend the amendment by tnkin? out
53,999, and inserting 50 391
Mr ATHERTON modihed las amendment so a to read
53,875
Mr BRIGGS had submitted this amendment, he «ai1 with a
