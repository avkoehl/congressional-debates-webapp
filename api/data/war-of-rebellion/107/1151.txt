started for the nearest telegraph office. We don't know where that is, but he will find it, and I suppose send the news to Washington. By a quick moving of Mr. Dunn and his wife I believe none of the late official dispatches were taken. Mr. Dunn told me so as we parted. It was a perfect surprise. They burned all the commissary stores and set fire to the goods, but otherwise they behaved well toward us, they using to violence. The captain of the party happened to be the brother of an old friend of mine in the Pacific, named Fitzhugh. By that my boat was saves by the bond, &amp;c. When the Titan left the wharf our cavalry were within a few hundred yards, but just in time to be too lat. If you require any more particulars, send for me at Kimberly & Bros. The boat shakes so I cannot write.

Very respectfully, &c.,

WM. WEBSTER.

P. S. - They shot all the horses, six or eight, and took their riders off with them as prisoners. Mr. Dunn, the telegraph operator, and his wife behaved nobly.
