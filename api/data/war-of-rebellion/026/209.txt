render. I then discovered about 30 or 40 cavalry forming ahead of us at College Place. Having thus the enemy to contend with at each end of the street I formed my men on the right side of Main street, when the body at College Place advanced in a charge. We held our fire until they were close to us. Our fire broke and confused them. We killed 3 men at this fire and wounded several and took 7 prisoners who were not wounded, besides killing and capturing the like number of horses, arms, &amp;c. I continued to move, but made another stand immediately at College Place upon discovering that the enemy in my rear moved after us. While in this position the enemy in the rear retired and your force then appeared.

This ends my report except to say I feel sorry your main object failed.

The enemy's loss in killed and wounded will be at least 13 and prisoners 11. We did not lose a man. Our men acted very bravely.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. A. WALLACE,

Captain, Commanding.

Colonel W. B. TABB,

Commanding Forces near Diascund, Va.
