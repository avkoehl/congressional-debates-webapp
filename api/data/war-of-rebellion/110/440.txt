VICKSBURG, March 22, 1863.

Brigadier General L. HEBERT:

GENERAL: Please have 500 or 600 men held in readiness to move up Deer Creek. Select the best battalions you can of veteran troops, sharpshooters. Please have the Parrott gun, 2.9-inch, of Sengstak's battery, held in readiness to accompany the expedition. I have asked for a squadron of cavalry to be sent up to you at once. We must cont river some means of getting this party to Wilson's. If a small steamer can accomplish it, one must be procured as soon as possible. I am about starting for Haynes' Bluff.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS MAURY'S DIVISION,

Vicksburg, March 23, 1863.

Many of the people of Fredericksburg, Va., are in great destitution and want. I believe it will be the wish of the officers and men of my division to contribute to their relief. I therefore request the regimental and company commanders to cause subscription lists to be opened in their respective commands, so that each member who desires to do so may enter his name and the amount he wishes to contribute. These lists, when completed, will be given to the brigade quartermaster in order that the amount may be deducted from the next payment.

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

(To each regiment and battery in division proper.)
