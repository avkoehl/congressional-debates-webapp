THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 21,
STEPHEN 0. GIBBS.
Mr. REA.GAN. I move that the Committee
of the Whole be discharged from the further con-
sideration of House bill No. 357, for the relief of
Stephen O. Gibbs, and that the bill be now put on
its passage.
Mr. TAPPAN. I object, unless the same priv-
ilege be extended to me.
Mr. SHERMAN." I move that the rules be
suspended, and the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
I will say, in support of my motion, that all I
desire is, that we may have some general debate
to-night. Gentlemen want to make speeches; and
by allowing that to be done this evening we shall
save time.
The motion was agreed to.
LEGISLATIVE^ ETC., APPROPRIATION BILL.
The House accordingly resolved itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
(Mr. Perry in the chair.)
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I ask what is
the bill before the committee ?
The CHAIRMAN. It is House bill No. 339,
making appropriations for the legislative, execu-
tive, and judicial expenses of the Governmentfor
the year ending the 30th June, 1861.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. That bill, I
believe, has not been made a special order jn the
committee, and therefore general debate is in or-
der upon it.
Mr. BURNETT. I desire to know whether
it is understood that nothing is to be done, ex-
cept making speeches? [Cnesof " Certainly!"]
Mr. CRAWFORD. 1 desire to say to the gen-
tleman from Maine, that the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr. Bocock] had the floor whin this ques-
tion was under consideration in the committee on
a previous occasion. He had no idea that the
House would go into committee to-day. I hope,
therefore, that when the House goes into com-
mittee again, the committee will, as a matter of
usual courtesy, allow the gentleman to be heard.
[Cries of " Certainly!" " Certainly !"]
The CHAIRM AN. The Chair recognized the
gentleman from Maine, and he is entitled to the
floor.
The committee was addressed by Messrs.
WASHBURN of Maine, MARTIN of Ohio,
COBB, WADE, COX, and PENDLETON.
[Their remarks will be published in'the Appendix.]
Mr. STEWART, of Maryland, obtainrd the
floor.
Mr. PENDLETON. Will the gentleman yield
to a motion to adjourn?
Mr. STEWART, of Maryland. As my col-
league from Baltimore, [Mr. Davis,] to whose
remarks I intend to reply, is not present, 1 will
yield.
Mr. PENDLETON. I move that the commit-
tee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Wade having
taken the chair as Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Perry
reported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
the Union generally under consideration, and par-
ticularly a bill (II. R. No. 339) making appro-
priations for the legislative, executive, and judicial
expenses of the Government for the year ending
the 30th of June, 18G1, and had come to no con-
clusion thereon.
ALFRED C. MURPHY AND OTHERS.
Mr. ALDRICH, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill for the relief of Alfred C. Murphy and
Hiram Kurmingham; which was read a fust and
second time, and referred to the Committee on
Public Lands.
And then, on motion of Mr. PENDLETON, (at
half past five o'clock, p. m.,) the House adjourned.
IN SENATE.
Monday, May 21, 1860.
The Journal of Saturday last was read and
approved.
ALTERATION OF THE SENATE CHAMBER.
The VICE PRESIDENT announced the ap-
pointment of Mr. Hale, Mr. Hammond, and Mr.
Benjamin, as the select committee on the bill (S.
No. 451) to alter and improve the construction of
the Senate Chamber.
PETITION.
Mr. HEMPHILL presented a petition of citi-
zens of Hill, Johnson, and Parker counties, in
Texas, praying the establishment of a mail route
from Hillsboro, in Hill county, to Crimea; thence
to Covington; thence to Buckhannon, in Johnson
county; and thence to Weatherford, in Parker
county, in that State; which was referred to the
Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads.
THE TARIFF.
Mr. CAMERON. I am requested to present
a petition signed by a large number of merchants
of the city of Philadelphia, who desire an altera-
tion in the revenue laws, and ask for some pro-
tection for the labor of citizens ofPenn sy1#1 ia,
aufi of the other States of this Union. In present-
ing the petition, I desire to say that the impres-
sion has gone abroad-throughout the State of
Pennsylvania that the bill which has passed the
House of Representatives on this subject will pass
the Senate. The good people of my State are
told that if they do not get an alteration in the
tariff this year, it will be the fault of the Repub-
licans of the Senate, and probably of a want of
good faith on my part. I desire to say, sir, that
I intend to press this question so that everybody
here shall have an opportunity of showing how
he stands upon it. To Pennsylvania this is the
great question. It is that in which all her inter-
ests, as her people believe, arc centered. It is
our "nigger." [Laughter.] In Pennsylvania,
everybody pretends to be in favor of an alteration
of the tariff so as to give protection to laborâ€”
Democrats and all others.
The Democrats are more noisy on the subject
than the other side. They say to the people,
"You will have protection, and you will get it
fr<*m the Democratic party in Congress." I re-
peat again, that I intend to bring this question
up on every proper occasion, so that before the
close of the session we shall have an opportunity
of seeing who is for it, and who is not. I think
I can pledge every vote on this side. I think every
man in opposition to the Administration now will
vote for a bill something like that which has passed
the House of Representatives; and, therefore, if
some five or six or seven votes on the other side
go with us, we, of course, shall get what we so
much desire.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Pennsylvania will pause a moment. The Chair
has been compelled to rap for order repeatedly
this morning, as the Senate is in great confusion.
It is very unpleasant for tho Chair to have to in-
terrupt the Senator on the floor until he can bring
the body to order.
Mr. CAMERON. I have said all that I care
about saying on this subject now, and have only
to repeat that I do not intend that the scenes which
were enacted in Pennsylvania in 1844, shall again
be acted in 1860. We will know our friends, and
learn also who are not the friends of the white
working men of Pennsylvania. If we are not to
get that which we desire so much, we shall know
who aie its foes, and who are not. I move that
the petition be referred to the Committee on Fi-
nance. m
The motion was agreed to.

whole or in part by steam, received from the House
of Representatives on Saturday last, was read

on Commerce.
PASSENGERS IN STEAMSHIPS.
Mr. SUMNER. I offer a resolution, and ask
for its immediate consideration:
Resolved, That the Committee on Commerce be instruct-
ed to consider the expediency of farther action, in order to
secure proper accommodations and pi oper safety for passen-
gers on board the steamers between New Yoik and San
Francisco, and to increase the efficacy of the existing pas-
senger laws of the United States in their application to Cali-
fornia passengers; with liberty to report by bill or other-
wise.
The Senate, by unanimous consent, proceeded
to consider the resolution.
Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President, I see the Sen-
ator from California [Mr. Latham] in his place,
and I am very glad of an opportunity of calling
his attention particularly to the resolution which
I now have the honor to offer. By a communica-
tion in the newspapers, from a very distinguished
sourceâ€”a clergyman who, during the last two
months, sailed from Boston to San Franciscoâ€”it
appears that the steamers are overloaded with pas-
, sengers, and withoutadequate accommodations of
other kinds for safety. His statement on the sub-
ject is very explicit, as it has been made in the
newspapers, as also in private letters which he
has addressed to his friends. I do notknow that
