PLANK ROAD STATION, August 22, 1864-12.50 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The enemy has broken up a small camp immediately in front of this station. There seems to be a force of the enemy in line or massed immediately southward of the fort already mentioned as near and west of the Weldon railroad. It is impossible to tell the numbers, but they are visible at several points through openings in the timber. They are about one mile or more south of the lead-works. About 400 additional cavalry came down the road from the direction of Petersburg. The indication are that all the troops seen this morning are massed in the vicinity of that fort or about one mile south of the lead-works.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.

They probably belong up the column that passed that point an hour and a quarter ago, and which probably kept the Petersburg road instead of going to the right of Fort Clifton.
