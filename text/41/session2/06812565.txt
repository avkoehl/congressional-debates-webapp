her undeveloped resources of natural wealth,
lias all the elements of a prosperous and power-
ful State ; and aroused from sleep she now like
a young giant enters upon a course of generous
rivalry with her sister States in advancing the
happiness of her own people and adding to the
common glory and strength of the American
Republic. With her there will be no looking
backward ; but ghe will press forward with
untiring energies, diffusing knowledge among
all classes of her citizens by the establishment
of common schools and colleges, and by the
construction of railways and canals, and by the
introduction of immigrants to share with her
own people the grand future of her social and
material prosperity.
In relation to the postal feature of the bill,
I desire to say that the company proposes to
carry the mails of the United States at the
lowest rates which may be imposed by Con-
gress ; and this, sir, upon the principle that
cheap postage increases correspondence, and
especially will such be the effect upon our
foreign correspondence.
The potent influence such increased letter-
writing between our adopted citizens and their
friends and relatives in the fatherland will
swell the tide of foreign immigration, and pro-
mote alike the profits of the company and in-
crease our national wealth. Spread broadcast
over Europe the most learned and exhaustive
treatises upon the subject of our immense re-
sources and of the advantages of our country
to foreign emigration, yet their influence will
pale before the magic power of the simple lines
of the humble immigrants who have settled
among us, and who in their artless manner tell
of their improved condition, and invite their
friends at home to follow them and share with
them the advantages of their adopted country.
In this connection, Mr. President, allow me
to say that my State, in common with the other
southern States, has made large appropria-
tions of money in the establishment of emi-
gration agencies, both at home and abroad, to
induce immigration into our States. These
efforts, while they are creditable to our people,
have been as yet unproductive of advantage to
us, for the obvious reasons that their efforts have
been directed to northern Europe, where the
trade is with the Northwest, and that we have
no lines of steamers to bring emigrants into
the South. Hence thousands who would come
among us, under the influence of existing for-
eign steamship lines.are diverted from their
purpose, and are drifted alongtlie currents of
trade and commerce into the north and west
sections of the Union.
Establish the Mediterranean and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company, opening up a
direct trade with Europe, and no law of nature
is more certain than that emigration will follow
in the wake of trade and commerce into the
South. We fully recognize the certainty of this
law, and do not propose to disturb it. We bid
God-speed to the northern States in this behalf.
But, sir, we propose by the establishment of this
company to open to the influence of the South,
as I have before said, one hundred million
population in southern Europe already accus-
tomed to the culture of our great staples, and
who, under the patronage of this company,
following the isothermal lines of climate, will
inevitably emigrate into the southern States,
as the people of northern Europe now emigrate
to the northern and western States. Surely
110 northern or western Senator upon this floor
will begrudge to the South the benefits to
arise from such a line of American steam-
ships, since it will not only not trench upon
(he interests of the North or West, but will,
by its reflex influence, add tp the common
welfare of the Union, and tend to increase
emigration from all European countries to our
own.
In this connection, Mr. President, I find
ready to hand some important statistics in the
report of Mr. J. D. Walker, chairman of the
committee on immigration of the Tennessee
Legislature. This report is the more pertinent
since it was made in reference to giving the
aid of that great State to the cause of immigra-
tion under the auspices of this company :
"The actual value of immigration to a State or to
our whole country is fur from being appreciated. It
is computed that since 1700 about seven million im-
migrants have arrived in thoUnitedStates, and these,
with their descendants, comprise nearly twenty mil-
lions of our population.
"In 1800 the population of the United States was
only about five millions, and without any immigra-
tion whatever, it would now be less than fifteen
millions. From May 5,1847, to December 31,1858,
there arrived at the port of New York 4.038,991
immigrants, and these nearly all settled in the
northwestern htatos. Thoy have added ten Senators
and over forty Representatives to the American
Congress.
" tfat immigration boen stopped in 1825, there
would have been comparatively small numerical
change m the population for I860, a. period of lorry
years, and yet how great has been the country's
growth. Without immigration the yoarlv increase
would havo been only ono and thirty-eight hun-
dretus per cent.
The actual increase from 1810 to 1S30 was thirty-
five and eighty-one hundrcths per cent., and from
1850 to I860 was thirty-live and litty-nine hundreths
percent.
"Immigration lia-; Hushed our country forward
forty years in national progress, and the increase in
wealth and political power is in the same ratio. To
this sourcowe owe at least ono half of all the taxable
property of the nation.
"The total mcreaso to our national wealth, esti-
mating both property and labor, by immigranls who
arrived from May, 1817, to December 31, 1858, was
$5,119,718,525, a sum nearly double the amount of the
entire national debt. The aggregate value of all
immigration to the United States at this tirooisosti-
mr ted atSs380,000,000 per year, or over ono million dol-
lars per day.
The average value of the personal property
of immigrants arriving at Castle Garden, New
York, has been found to be $1-30 for each per-
son, man, woman, and child.
German immigrants alone have for many
years brought an average yearly amount of
about eleven million dollars.
In 1859 this accretion of wealth at Castle
Garden was $B7,50U,000 ; and to this source
the North owes a large part of its material
advancement in population and wealth over
the southern States of the Union.
Again, sir, the Mediterranean and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company propose, underthe
provisions of their charter, to transport the
cotton, sugar, rice, tobacco, and other produc-
tions of the southern States in American bot-
toms direct from Norfolk and Port .Royal to
the ports of southern Europe, avoiding the
expense and delay of shipping the same into
Italy, Austria, southern Germany, France, and
Spain by the way of Liverpool, Bremen, and
Hamburg, thereby promoting, in the economy
of direct transportation, the interests of the pro-
ducer and consumer, both in the outward and
return cargoes.
Pew persons have any definite idea of the
magnitude of the exports of the southern States,
or of the increase of that trade which would
certainly follow from the opening of a direct
trade between them and Europe, and ulti-
mately, through the Suez canal, wi;h the ports
of southern Asia.
The following statistics, taken from the pro-
ceedings of the national commercial conven-
tionheld in Boston in February, 18(58, and from
other reliable sources, will throw light upon
this important subject:
The direct exports from the United State3 to Franco
and Spain in the Atlantic and Mediterranean ports
were   - §57.173,39-1
Our whole imports from thesame ports were 40,014,099
Of these expoits, tobaccos raw and manufactured,
was S5.731.820
And ol cotton  23,792,559
Aggregate of tobacco and cotton alone...$34.524,379
From this showing it appears that nearly
two thirds of our exports to France and Spain
were in cotton and tobacco alone, and I have not
included in this estimate the indirect southern
trade through England with these countries
which may be fairly put at $40,000,000 more.
But a better idea of the magnitude and
value of the commerce of the southern States
will appear from the fact that in 1868, 2,500,-
000 bales of cotton were produc«d. If the
population of the South were sufficient we
could as well raise 8,000,000 bales. Before
the war our product was 5,500,000 bales.
This additional 3,000,000 bales, bad it been
raised in 18G8 and I860, at $100 per bale,
would have produced the sum of $500,000,000.
The estimated demand of cotton for the
world is put down at some 6,500,000 bales
per annum. If it be objected to the increased
cultivation of this great staple at the South that
the market would be glutted, it is sufficient to
say that uo people can compete with us in its
production, and that at rates at which we can
make it a most profitable crop it cannot be
produced in India. Besides, it is admitted that
the culture of cotton in British India to meet
the demand, while our supply during the war
was limited, cannot long be continued, for it is
threatening a famine in that country, by divert-
ing from the production of breadstuffs lauds
for the growth of cotton, thus raising the price
of breadstuffs by their limited supply, so that
the increased cost of bread exceeds the profits
of the cotton culture: and, indeed, with a
further decline, say to fifteen cents per pound,
it could not be produced at all in India or
Egypt. We have, therefore, nothing to fear
from this source in the production of our cot-
ton. Besides, the vast and rapid increase of
our population, and the influence of our free
institutions upon the style of living and better
clothing of our citizens, will increase the
demand for cotton and fully justify the conclu-
sion that 8,000,000 bales of cotton may bo
reckoned as the amount which may be profit-
ably produced in the southern States. Indeed,
when wo contemplate the future of the Repub-
lic, who will dare limit the demand of this great
staple for the supply even of our own country?
In one province of China 4,200,000 bales of
cotton are produced, the whole of which is con-
sumed within tlic country of its production, and
even then foreign cotton is imported to supply
the unfilled home consumption. Shall the Uni-
ted States in this respect be placed, in its future
progress, on a lower plane than that of China?
In 1867 our exports to the Asiatic and East India
ports were:
To the Dutch East Indies  $204,395
To the British East Indies  3S1,14]
To Australia  5,102,355
To Philippine Islands  4r>.6&5
To other Pacific islands  85,137
To China  8/738,145
S14.C0G,Su9
Our imports were:
From British Indies  $8,932,485
From Australia  202,401
From China  12.112,440
From Philippine Inlands  3,473,371
$21784,697
Total exports to the Mediterranean and East In-
dies  $71,780,203
Total imports from same, as above  Go,394,7'i6
Total exports and imports  $137,174,999
The whole imports to the United States in 1807
wcro  S417.831.o71
Total exports from the United States
were  438,577,312
Total exports and imports  $850,408,8S3
From these statements it will be seen that
about one sixth of the whole commerce of the
United States in 1867 falls within the scope of
the intended operations of this company, and
this trade must be greatly increased by the
opening of the Suez canal, as well as by the
stimulus which the company will impart to the
whole South, increasing her great staples for
the demands of a direct trade with foreign
ports.
In 1857 the whole value of our commerce
was $536,000,000. Of this was carried under a
foreign flag only $131,000,000. While in 1867
our commerce was $874,000,000, and there was
carried in alien vessels $577,600,000.
