Company A, Seventh Provisional Regiment,that has been on a reconnaissance to the mouth of North Fork, came in this morning. The lieutenant in command reports that he saw and conversed with a woman who left General Price's army the day before, and said Price was at Clinton a week ago yesterday,and intended to remain there until the infantry and artillery came up; that she has been with his army three weeks, and that the whole army had moved north, and that some cavalry was to tear up the railroad leading from Saint Louis to Rolla, and the main body was to advance and take Springfield. No force of the enemy was discovered.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Moses Powers is well known here, and used to be in General Holland's command. He was with parties of Fagan's men three times on his way up. The only thing he saw with his own was three bodies of cavalry of 500 or 600 men, and the roads over which the armies had passed, which he says were deeply cut up. All the other information he gave he obtained from citizens, rebel officers, and soldiers. General Holland says he is an honest and reliable man, and has always had the reputation of a good scout.
