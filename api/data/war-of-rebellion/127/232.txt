the common enemy of the South. Virginia needs our aid. I therefore request you to furnish one regiment of infantry without delay, to rendezvous at Harper's Ferry, Va. It must consist of ten companies of not less than sixty-four men each. The regiment will be entitled to one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, one major, one adjutant form the line of lieutenants, one sergeant-major from the enlisted men. Each company is entitled to one captain, one first lieutenant, two second lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, and two musicians.

The officers, except staff officers, are to be appointed in the manner prescribed by the law of your State. Staff offers are appointed by the President; the term of service not less than twelve months, unless sooner discharged. They will be mustered into the service of the Confederate States at Harper's Ferry, but transportation and subsistence will be provided from the point of departure. They will furnish their own uniform, but will receive its value in communication. Arms and ammunition will be sent to Harper's Ferry or such point as you may designate. Answer, and say whether you will comply with this request, and if so, when.
