BEVERLY, VA., July 23, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

I leave in the morning. Will reach the railroad (forty-eight miles) to-morrow, and thence per railroad without delay to Washington. I have given the necessary directions for the disposition of the troops in this region to fortify Cheat Mountain and Parkersburg and Winchester pike, in advance of Cheat River. Rosecrans is left in command and will at once go to Kanawha. I take it for granted that Johnston will move on Grafton, and provide accordingly.

Major-General.

Cheat River region is stripped of troops except one regiment. One, diverted from Huttonsville, went to Oakland last night. Two more, ordered from Beverly, will reach there to-morrow evening. A telegram from Governor Morton announced the Twelfth and Sixteenth indiana has left Indianapolis for Washington without orders from the Department.

I have telegraphed Governor Morton troops are wanted here to clear Cheat River. You all see the necessity if the enemy enterprising.

Please reply as soon as possible.
