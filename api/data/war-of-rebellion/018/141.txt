HEADQUARTERS SCHENCK'S BRIGADE,May 7, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT:

Just received the following from General Milroy:
HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE, McDowell-12 noon.

Brigadier General SCHENCK:

Enemy pressing us. Our forces thus far engaged are parts of three regiments. Must have aid. Have reason to believe that part of enemy coming up North River Gap, to prevent Junction of your forces with mine; inform Fremont. Cannot Blenker's force make a forced march, relieve you and myself? Cannot you join me? Ask Fremont to have Banks press on in the rear of Jackson. Answer by messenger.

R. H. MILROY,Brigadier-General.

Answer me where you are and with what force. Where is Blenker's force? Will there be any re-enforcements but mine? I am pressing forward.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Brigadier-General.

McDOWELL, May 7, 1862-9 p.m.

Brigadier-General SCHENCK:

Your two messages received. If you come by Monterey, would suggest that you leave your most fatigued companies there, say three or four, to relieve two companies of the Second Virginia, now stationed there, and bring them on with you, as they will be fresh. The enemy are approaching in two directions, and will be almost certain to attack me at daylight. The commissary-sergeant, Dumont, of the Seventy-fifth Ohio, will tell you further particulars.

In haste,

MILROY.
