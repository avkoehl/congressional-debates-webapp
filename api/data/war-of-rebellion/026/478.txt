FORT MONROE, VA., December 12, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK;

Major-General Peck telegraphs that his expedition to Zuni found the roads very bad. Our troops have nor succeeded in crossing. The enemy has been strongly re-enforced. Sharp firing has been going on all day across the river. General Peck says the demonstration is having the effect of drawing troops to this quarter, so that on the whole line was shall greatly benefit General Foster. I have a dispatch from General Foster this morning informing me that he should leave New Berne at daybreak yesterday. Wessells was with him. He says the enemy in his front has been strengthened, and he expects a hard fight.

The Pennsylvania regiments are arriving with wretched arms.
