The remainder of the Twelfth Illinois Cavalry are stationed at Napoleonville to watch the various approaches. The reserve force here, which can move toward Donaldsonville or Brashear, consists of the Sixtieth Indiana Infantry, the Second Maine Cavalry, five companies of the Eighteenth New York Cavalry, and the Fourth Iowa Battery.
