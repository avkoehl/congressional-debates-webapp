was cut last year our service, under the superintendence of the Sanitary Commission. Some disposition should be made of it, I respectfully suggest, so that it may not be wasted. There are also about 500 log-houses, used by the enemy when in winter quarters here. I am called upon to furnish teams and wagons to haul wood for the use of the railroad at and near Warrenton Junction. I have furnished them temporarily, as it was reported that the need was urgent. Shall I continue to do so?

I regret to report that the railroad management on this road exhibits the lack of executive capacity, or the presence of incompetent agents. Of this the reports of Captain Rusling, assistant quartermaster, herewith transmitted, furnish additional evidence.

Having been informed yesterday that Major-General McClellan would proceed from Warrenton to Washington by railroad, I directed the troops of the division to be paraded at their respective posts, and to receive our late commander with the honors appropriate to his rank. Major-General Hooker arrived at Manassas about 1 p. m., on his way to Warrenton. Soon after the departure of General McClellan's train for Washington, General Hooker proceeded to his destination, and was received at this camp, at Bristoe, and Warrenton Junction with similar honors.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

D. W. SICKLES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Asst. Adjt. General, Headquarters Defenses of Washington.
