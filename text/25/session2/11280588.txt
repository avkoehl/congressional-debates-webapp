ject by its light 11 irae the efforts made*o dupe the public in
regard to it have bee 1 not less bold than some oí them have
been rid cu ous
Thus your Secretary of the Trpa.>nry, when íecommeudine
this very n easure of an issue of Government paper, prefaces
by telling its that it may be done ' without treading on the Je
bitabk ground of either the power or pohr\ of chartering a
Nu.onal Pank ' Now, sir, what put that in his head, if he
did not think that he was at least approaching the questionable
limits?   Then, after chalking out hie plan for an issue of Trea
"«ury paper, a well known banking power, and, taken m con
nection with other powers desired by the" Executive to be con
ferred upon the Tiea-siiry, well calculated to excite suspicion,
and completely (if not more) carrying our General Jackson s
original plan, he concludes with this solemn assurance "But
no loans 0! the u appear advisable, nor any bank incdr pa ration,
band officeis, 01 bank machineiy whatever, in connection with
thesubject,"as if this people could be duped into the belief
that there could be fio bank without an act oí incorporation,
and tha£ üeosuiers, registers, auditors, and clerks could not be
as mucu hank offsets as presiden^ and Cashiers
Truly, sir, this effort til the worthy SeciéUtry puts us in mind
of the old story ot theaitist,%ho, having painted on,,the tavern
sign what he designe 1 shauld represent General Washiogton
arid his hoise, out of abundant caution wis induced to write
upon it, thib is the man and that is the hor^e Our Secretary,
however, impioves upon the example Thedifficulty wuh the
limner was, that, alter all his pains, the observer rmg it fail to
understand hib intention, that with the Secretary wat, that his
might be too obviollá And, therefore, having first told ub what
he did not intend to make, and having dipped his pencil m co
lois least hkeiv to disríoc-e his obtect, fie yet finds himself con
strained to Write upon hit pietute that Et is neither man nor
horse
I think sufficient has been shown to satisfy every one that the
measuie proposed by tht bill was oug'ma'Hy maintained as
one antagonist to bank cnetilation, and may be consldeied so
still It must, theu oie, be injurio is to the State institutions,
and embari ass them in the cffoit of resumption It maybe in
junous m two ways ist K will till the country with that much
more of paper monej, and 2d It is a pow er which may again
be ibused as it was before, and with it new expeuments tried
upon the currency, tending to keep up the present confusion
and general stagflation of business Tim  is the great evil of the
times, and, ill admit, cannot be íemoved until a general
resumption ol specie payments takes place To effect this as
soon, and with ashttlc loss £ís po^sib'ej should be our grind ef
fui, mil,it I have faiUd to satisfy you tntt á new issue of Go
vernmentpapei will retaid this event, it should be a sufficient
objection that it will not hasten and insure it so certainly as
will the measure proposed bv the amendment
I have heard no fnend of the bill contend lhat it will aid 01
hapten a resumptun, while the beneficial influence of a loan
mn«tbe very evident, whether it is taken at home or abroad
Fuming a valuable lemtttance, it will he equal to a new crea
(ion of value to the amount equal to just so much cotton, rice,
or tobacco and will thus tend to cq lahze foreign exchanges,
and keep them regular So ais  at h míe such a stock would
be exceedingly desn ible Many mt n have withdrawn thctrca
pttal from the usual pursuits of trade, nor will they be likely
again to jeopard it in such operations until more quiet times
Untan investment in stocks so safe as this will be, will be
pa 11 ly sought by all these cautious men, ahd thus ironey will
bt drawn out from its hiding places, and put to the purposes of
comineice, wh ch miela otherwise for a long time remain ullc,
to the great injury of the country
Mi Chan man in support of this amendment, I rely much
on this argument thu while it answers all the put poses of Go
\ernmeht in pay ma its debtt it will aid materially in bringing
about the resume don < I specie pa>meats by the banks I am
fully sen ible su, of the dmgei I incur as well as all others
who act \>uh me (fining iür motives mjsrcpiesented when
«ayonp woidm behalf of the^e institutions. Alieady in the
couisf cf tins debate have we been denounced as lepresentmg
tncinttiest of capitalist* as dismguisled from that of the
coun iy But sir, 1 cnmpltm not of it it is what public men
must expect our tonduct is befoie the country, and I abide
the result Ninsfied I am that the country will bee, as we do,
that in some way or other cveiy mm, woman, and child in
this broad land ismtereste 1 m the welfare of those institutions,
and that whatever shall brm'di«tre=:s or relief to them will in
the act convey benefit or mjuiy throughout all the busi
nesq relations of Ufe, and accoidmg to my unders'anding, it is
much to the credit of the Opposition that they joined notihe
ou cry against these banks but, as far asm their power, have
siujrht to allay excitement, rector*e confidence, and set them
again in operation, as being mo^t effectual foi the relief of the
peop c. And having fought manfully 11 this battle, and in
some decree piotected this cieat interest fiom the nssaultsof
those in power, until it could lecoverfrom the shock, and the
business of the country revive with it, weweie not prepared
for the remarks lately heard heic and elsewhere, that the Ad
ministration has r¡ev (1 be n hostile to the banks, that it has al
ways been their true fnend, and we their false one
A mate part cular incjuny into this mattei I deem neither in

I would first inquire, how it hapens if the designs of the Ad
ministration have always b°en fnendlj towards this interest
that so deep and settled a conv iction *hou!d prevail to the con
tiaiy The gentleman from South Caio ma [Mr Rhett] tells us
that the charge has been made and reiterated bv the press undtr
hank control, until the courtiv his sot to believe it Sir, the
Admm stration his had *> much more efficient press under itb
control and quite a« active m 11s cau=e How then could thio
charge have obtained l'sfoo'hold ui !e«s the conduct oí those

truth in it. and this denial is an nftt rthoi ght I'nul veiy recent
ly 1* was teheved that more fav jr was to be gained by abusing
tl e banks, than being their fnei d and it was not until the peo
pie, becoming jealous i f the designs of power and fearing the
destruct on of State mteiesu rallied around them, that the
alarm was taken and this (Vmal made
As it is more than likely that gentlemen at d myself may differ
as to what "hostility i<*, when dnected a«a.n t these institution ,
I will, ti avoid all mibunderstandmg, have rtsort to the "ame
high authority to which I have beiore reterred, [Mr Be\to> ]
Fiom that gentleman's late speech I read you so vrtteh as will
show how such hostilities, as he alleges, were formerly earned

Mr Benton s Speech, Uth Muich>\838
Whether the Opposition ever were eremies of the State m
stitutions, as thus asserted, I shailleave for the public to deter*'
mine Time has shown the truth of the warnings we then gave
of v. hat would be the result of the mad attempt of the party
m power to break down the National Bank, and to stimulate
and excite the State banks to supply its place Theexpen
ment has been tried, and ietthe people judge oí it
My pui pose now is to show that, ever since the ¿catastrophe
m may la!st, tiré administration has been fadsti e to the existing
institutions, and, instead of aiding and helping them to resume
specie paymeatfi, has greats retarded the operation And how
was this great object to be effected? There was but one thing
wanted, and shat was a restoration of confidence} and, so far a*
ihe action of this Government was concerned,how was that to
be done7 None can hesitate m the reply By the Government
bestowing us own confidence upon them, and speaking well of
them in the late distuibedstate of affairs, it required not ©tffy
that Government should manifest its  wn confidence by its as
sertions, but by its acte It would be in vain to tell the people 1 
have confidence, and place their property and business again
with the b inks, while we are refusing them our confidence ami
our business It would have been bad enough if the Govern-
ment, when it refused further to confide in the banks, had let
them alone, and not sought to destroy what little of reputation
they had left But such was not its pleasure, and, not only h-ig
it ceased ail connection with them, but its agents and pamzans
have assailed the banks from all quauers with untiring abuse
The elements of hostility against banke, as laid down by Mr
Bento  are
J   In the tise of terms of reproach, to render them odious
2   In statements to discredit them
3   In assertions to destroy confidence m them
4    In attempts to excite runs upon tliemj and to blow them up
And now, sir, m reference to these matter*!,I will begm with
the very head of the parly, and refer you to General Jackson's
celebrated letter to Mosses Dawson He thus denounces the
bank&
'After the treachery of the banks to the Government, it will
be in vain to suppose that the people can ever be jndnced to a''
qmesce m their employment again as public depositories "
This short sentence, m my estimation, covers the who'e
grouhl of hostility, as defined by Mr Benton Here is the
term of reproach, "treachery," calculated to render the hanks
"oáíOws," to ' (¿tscredii" and "destroy confidence tnfhem,"
and to destroy confidence in them for all time to come For
he says the people can never acquiesce m then employment
by the nation, and if they are thus unsafe lor tne nation, must
they not be so for the people?
Not satisfied however, he alludes to this ilti eachery" again
and agun in that letter, and strives tothowthat it might be
committed m a time 01 war, and thus bring the country under
foreign subjection Thus dnettly impeaching the patrioti&m
ol those irteresttd in these institutions, and warning the coun
tiv to trust them no lorger
Tms chaige v,w aftei wards made on tins floor by a friend of
the Administran m—the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr Mvr
ray ]   His language was
[such depositories wilt ever have it m their power to thwart
the purposes of Government, by withholding her funds, woich,
in extraordinary encumstances, as m time ol war, might enable
them to upset the Government "
He also tel e us that
" The histoiy of banks will show that gain is the great object
of their creation and existence This they pursue with th 
avidity of a hungry tigci "
Suiely, sir, this is stiarge language tocóme from a parly
fuendly to the banks, and desirous oí restoring confidence m
them Their patnoii&m is directly questioned It 4s asserted
that they ate entirely go veined by mtuest, and in another pait
ot the same argument we aie told that they are in theliands of
brokers an i shaveis, and would continue so to ba A calcula
tion is then entered into, to show how the peo( !e will lose tout
teen millions of doi'ars by ihe depreciation oí ten per cent on
the one hundred and forty millions of bank circu'ation
Do we not hnd here statements that discredit} and assertions
that will destroy confidertce in, banks V* by, sir, a friend, m
place of magnifying the losses  sustained by the suspension,
would have entered upon the much more easy task of show mg
how destructive to all mteiests would have been the contin-
uance of specie payments under all the circumstoices lie
would have noticed the fact the banks, having on hand but one
dollar in specie to thiee or four of their paper out, could not
long have  ustaineo the demand, and that suspension could not
there i ore have been averted at that period oi alarm, while ¡he
unavailing effort, r quiring severeexactionsupontbeirdebtors,
would 1 avecieatcd much greatei distress and confusion And
when setting down the discount on paper atten percent while
the banks hadm their vaults one quarter to one thud enough
specie to redeem'heir bi1 s, he toi Id scarcely have oiriltedto
inquire what would have b en the discount tn theSQor 100
millions that would have remait d after all their specie was
eone in redemption In place of being 10 per cent, and a Joss
of 14 millions, he would ¡.«haps have set it down at 60 per
cent  and a loss 01 45 or 50 millions at least

tion tending to discredit ana destroy confidence m tie State
banks It wall be tound that the very gentleman [Mr Bb«to\j]
who detailed the n anncr in which the Oppomit n bad waned
against them has himself m that^ame speech, been guilty ol
the same offence He states, sir that many of ihe banks were
'í otttn to the vo and would fall to pieces" the instant they
aie put the teet l -1 talks ab< ut forcu g and diiviñg the banks
to resume, by die *ar ofconsequences " but never of aiding
or helping them, ai i, taking his speech altogether, none can
mistake th?uhe leading otject of lercmg a te^mptiou is the
hope 1 at inofet, it net all the banks will be destroyed in the
opeiauon
Bue,^! shall ro detain the committee wi h further rtfe
