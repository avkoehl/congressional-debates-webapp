JACKSON, MICH., August 19, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERONN,

Secretary of War:

I have your second dispatch of last night and will proceed to obey its instructions at once, and will inform you from time to time as the troops move. Hope to send 5,000 men within six days. Can Brigadier General A. S. Williams be detailed to aid in the mustering?

AUSTIN BLAIR,

Governor.

JACKSON, MICH., August 19, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

We have no military organization in the State of any consequence now, except the three-years' regiment. It would be no use to call for troops for temporary service at present. We can furnish three-years' men just as easily, and prefer it. I can furnish more regiments than have been required if you wish on pretty short notice.

AUSTIN BLAIR,

Governor.

Governor BLAIR,

Jackson, Mich.:

Fill up all regiments authorized as rapidly as possible and hold yourself in readiness for more. We may require them.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

JACKSON, MICH., August 19, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I desire to say a word which is not appropriate for the telegraph. It is to make an earnest appeal to you to recognize no more independent regiments in this State. They are introducing confusion and discord into all our affairs. Companies are divided andn officers in unseemly quarrels. I will furnish all the troops you call for much sooner and in better order than these independent regiments can do, and thus avert a great amount of local ill-feeling.

I remain, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

AUSTIN BLAIR,

Governor of Michigan.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 19, 1861.

Governor OLDEN,

Trenton, N. J.:

Arm your men as far as it is possible. We understand that you have a large number of good arms and accouterments belonging to New Jersey. All deficiencies in equipment will be made up here.

SIMON CAMERON.
