It would have been impossible at that time to have retired from the position we occupied, and by direction of Brigadier-General Ransom, who had arrived upon the field and assisted in person in arranging the line, I assumed the offensive as soon as I saw their whole line advancing, so as to meet them upon better ground and with a better effect. A general engagement ensued, lasting one hour and a half, which was by far the most desperate I ever witnessed. Some parts of the line were broken after a short but terrific engagement, but in other parts it remained firm and unbroken until the enemy had flanked my whole force and began an attack in the rear. Seeing that the capture of the entire force was inevitable unless I withdrew, I ordered the remainder of the shattered regiments to fall back, which they attempted, but were unable to accomplish with entire success.

The list of the killed and wounded of my command cannot be ascertained, inasmuch as the enemy retained possession of the field, but that we suffered severely there can be no doubt. Many brave men fell, but they fell with their faces to the foe. Honored be their memory. That the enemy suffered immensely is known by actual observation and by statements of prisoners captured the day following, who acknowledged they had purchased a victory at a bloody price. Colonel J. W. Vance, commanding Second Brigade, fell while gallantly cheering his men, but whether wounded or killed is unknown. Colonel Frank Emerson, commanding First Brigade, also fell wounded while nobly performing his duty, and is a prisoner in the hands of the enemy. Major Reid, of the One hundred and thirtieth Illinois, was killed while rallying his men.* Lieutenant-Colonel Lindsey, of the Forty-eighth Ohio, is reported wounded, and Major Bering, of the same regiment, killed.* Lieutenant-Colonel Cowan, Nineteenth Kentucky, was conspicuous for the manner in which he managed his regiment, directing the fire of his men and preserving, up to the order of retreat, an unbroken line, driving the rebels from his front in three charges, and ordering the fire in which the rebel General Mounton was killed while leading a charge, carrying a regimental flag. When ordered to withdraw he remarked that he had driven the rebels from his front, and if the remainder of the line stood firm he could not be taken. In endeavoring to obey the order he is reported to have been wounded and captured. Major Mann, of the same regiment, is reported killed or wounded.

To Major Greene and the officers and men of the Twenty-third Wisconsin, for the manly and noble manner in which they supported the battery and held the left of the line until further resistance was impossible, I desire to express my admiration and gratitude. Major Sears and he gallant Sixty-seventh Indiana and Major Burdett and the brave men of the Seventy-seventh Illinois deserve the highest praise for their conduct. The officers and men of the One hundred and thirtieth Illinois and Forty-eighth Ohio deserve equal praise. Though the survivors mourn the loss of their gallant field officers, they have the consolation of knowing that they all did their duty. Lieutenant-Colonel Brown, of the Ninety-sixth Ohio, and the men
