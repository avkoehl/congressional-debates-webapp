Lieutenant Colonel MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I moved my command this instant from Morrisville, N. C., to a position two miles distant form Raleigh on the Hillsborough road, where it is now in camp, with a front nearly north. The ground occupied by the division is at present unfavorable for a pleasant camp, but by considerable labor can be made a fair ground. My troops have marched a distance of twelve miles upon a neighborhood road to the left (from Morrisville) of the main road, and made their present camp at 2 p. m. .

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. CORSE,
