OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., April 11, 1863.

Colonel HENRY DENT, Provost-Marshal-General, Louisville, Ky.

COLONEL: Your letter of 4th instant with rolls of political prisoners and deserters is received. The following extract* from a letter addressed to Captain S. E. Jones, aide-de-camp, will instruct you how to dispose of deserters from the rebel army. Your letter of the 22nd ultimo is received and I have to reply that deserters from the rebel army cannot be considered prisoners of war, but to insure their loyalty they should be required to take the oath of allegiance, with the penalty of death for its violation. If professed deserters come with our lines they may be spies and every commanders judge of each case after careful inquiries according to the circumstances.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,
