From a woman who had been in Dardanelle they learned that Price was there, and in command. The rebels state that they intend capturing this place, to help Shelby out of his scrape, and then go to Missouri. The Chippewa left this morning, leaving her cargo here. I am pressing everything, and will try and save it. I will get everything away by 3 o'clock, with the exception of the cavalry. I will send the train to the Cadron with the Second Arkansas Infantry, and dismounted men of the Third. An infantry force is reported as going to cross at Red Fork, below the Cadron. Have I anything to fear from Shelby? I have scouts well out to keep the enemy busy as possible. I will hold the line of the Cadron till I hear from you. Duplicate this to General Steele.

LEWISBURG, September 8, 1864-7 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel Fuller, with scout of 130 men, met Cabell in cavalry and infantry force twenty miles from here, on Springfield and Dover road, en route for this place. Fuller was surrounded, but cut his way out; Lieutenants Wishard, Carr, Greene, and 30 men missing. Have sent word to Colonel Stephenson to start the train for Little Rock immediately. Have sent courier after the other scouting parties. I have everything in readiness to advance or retreat soon as scouts get in.

LEWISBURG, September 8, 1864-8.40 p.m.

Lieutenants Carr, Wishard, and Greene have come in, Greene slightly wounded. I do not think our loss will exceed 15 killed, wounded, and missing. There are three brigades of the enemy-Dockery's, Cabell's, and, I think Fagan's. I presume the enemy will move to Springfield and try and cut us off from the Cadron. Our horses are pretty well used up; am giving them a few hours. If there are any horses to spare in Little Rock, I trust we can get some, as we need them badly.
