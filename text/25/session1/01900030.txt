such charge 'hall come from the same source
which requires tis to íepeal the deposite law, be-

to issue a Government paper to pay the charges

of retienchment and reform'' I repeat, shall we
never be exempt Irom the mockery of a constant

Mr Chan-mar, the only consolation I have felt
in the survey of the wide-spread mishaps which
have grown out of the late maladministration of
public affairs, particular!/ m relation to the cur-
rency and finances of the countiy—the individual
depre sion and suffering—the public loss of charac-

REMARKS OF MR. DLNC \N,
Of Ohio,
Inlhe HouseofKepe^entu'iie-, September20, 1837 —
On the bill to postpone tlu. 4ih instalment of the
public deposites
Mr DUNCAN said he was anxious <o the pas-
saee oí ihc 1 ill, theie vv as moie thar one conside-
rat on that opeiated on his mind and induce I him
to suppoit it The object of the dppesite act w is to
leliexefhe fieasurv >f the suiplus lpvenue—a sur-
plus w! eh, as h vi oi Id itfe npt to show, grew out
of a policy Uie m st dangerous and disastious in
its eharactei, and wn ch, if it had been persisted
in, -would ha\e,ma!lpiobability severed thisUnion
—he meant the unequal and inequitable pobcj
misnamed 'the Aneiican System," which had for
its object the official elevation cf its piojectors and
yealoassupporters, and vv hich, m its cperaüon, was
at the same tune beneficial to one portion of the
Union ard destructive to another The surplus was
now disposed of, and the object for which the de-
posite law was made, is accomplished, and it was
of no further use He hoped it would take its place
among the things that had been and are not, and
that the policy which gave rise to its necessity
would share the same fate
The question involved in the bill was simply
whether the Government shall deposite nine mil-
lions of dollars with the States, in proportion to
their representation in Congress, when, to enable
him to do it, she must borrow a sum equal in
amount, to supply her own wants during the cui-
rent year
The first fact upon which the question depends
is, does the Government want 1he money? And if
she does, is it not better that she should keep her
own and use it, than to deposite it with the States
and «run m debt for an equal amount to supply her
own wants'? To convince the committee that the
amounl of the fourth instalment of the deposites
would be wanted by the Government for her own
u^e, he had prepaied a statement, which w as the
result of a calculation from the facts stated in the
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and he
believed it would be found coirect, and conclu-
sively show (hat Government would want the full
amount of .the foutth instalment In submitting
the statement, he would acknowledge his obligation
to the worthy and distinguished gentleman from
Maryland, (Mr McKim,) for the assistance hG
had íeceived from him m preparing the statement.

This is an actual deficit, notwithstanding there
ought to be a sum equal to this always in the
Treasury, which really shows a deficit of above
$10,000,000
Whatever expenditures shall arise within the
year upon new appropriations w hieh Congress may
think proper to make, will require a corresponding
addition to this amount, but without them, it will
constitute an excess of $5,363,322 33 of expendi-
tures o,er both the leceipts and the balance at the
end of the yev, besides not leaving at the close of
the y ear any thing in fhe Treasury or Mint foi fu-

If, said Mr D the report of the "Secretary of ihe
Treasury is a correct and tr^e ■exposition of the
slate of the Treasury and the flounces of the na-
tion, then his statement proved, beyond all doubt,
that the money proposed to be depos'ted as a fourth
instalment was required for the use of the Govern-
ment, and it disposed of the maia question
Before he w em into the other Questions involved
m the pissage of this bill, he felt himself bound to
t'ischarge an obligation he was i nder to redeem a
friend fiom some unkind remarks indulged in by
Fenfleman from South Carolina, (Mr Pickens)
The gentleman had represented the honorable
Secretary's report as obscure and unintelligible, as
full of errors m point of its anfhmetical calcula-
*ioni and its grammai, anl had thrown out the
insinuation that Congiess could not mike a more
fit appropriation, or one mor° useful, than for the
purpose of his mstmction in those brunches of
science He regretted to hear the literary charac-
ter of one oi the principal Executive officers of
the Government thus assailed, and attempted to be
degraded Such statements did not merely strike
at the reputation of the distinguished individual
against whom they were spoken, but they were
calculated to reflect discredit upon the parly in
