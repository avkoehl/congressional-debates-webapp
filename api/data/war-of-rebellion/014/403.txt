YORKTOWN, March 27, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The enemy is just reported, by Colonel Cumming, at Young's Mill, to be advancing in great force on the Warwick road. He is advancing with all his forces on three roads, having been reported to be at Sykes' Corner, as well as above Bethel. Please answer by telegraph.

By holding the works in front of Williamsburg the re-enforcements might be in time. If he carry our line on the Warwick River we shall lose a part of our artillery.

YORKTOWN, March 27, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

The following dispatch received to-day from Norfolk:

NORFOLK, March 27, 1862.

General MAGRUDER:

The Yankees have received large re-enforcements at Fort Monroe and Newport News the last three days. It would be hard to estimate how many. The town of Hampton and all the available beach to Fort Monroe is occupied by encampments; also Newport News and 1 mile below there; also two encampments between Newport News and Hampton and the north shore. I think myself the re-enforcements cannot be far from 30,000, if not more.

Great activity prevails. Vessels are arriving and departing continually, night and day.

JAS. F. MILLIGAN,

Signal Officer.

J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

Major-General.
