DECHERD, October 6, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of dispatch. I will be ready.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. H. RUGER,

Brigadier-General.

DUCK RIVER BRIDGE,

October 6, 1863

General BUTTERFIELD:

It is but rumor unconfirmed as to burning of Shelbyville. Scouts are not in. Cannot say where rebels are going. Were in Shelbyville at noon. Had pickets out a mile. Some say two regiments.

All is vague.

COBURN,

Colonel.

ELK RIVER, October 6, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Plates, cross-pieces, corble ties, and stringers are already prepared. I am well acquainted with country and know where I can cut the posts; the battery is my armament, and ought to go with me. I have once built this bridge, but the plan and bill of timber is in Nashville. The train has passed here.

K. A. HUNTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Engineer Corps.

ELK RIVER, October 6, 1863

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Shall I send two companies of my regiment with the engineers? Colonel Hunton desires it. He will in that case leave his battery here. The battery is essential to the defense of this post. We shall then have about 700 men here.

CHAS. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel First U. S. Colored Troops.

[Indorsement.]

Answer-yes.

BUTTERFIELD.

TULLAHOMA, October 6, 1863

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

I have two 3-inch rifles and one 12-pounder Napoleon, with horses for four guns.

JAMES M. HENDERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel Thirty-third Indiana.
