COLONEL: There seemed to be an unusual stir among the enemy last night, moving of wagon trains, cheering of troops, &amp;c. General Gracie says that the enemy informed him this morning that they were cheering over the old news-fall of Atlanta; they also informed him that the colored regiment in his front was from Pennsylvania, that it belonged to the Eighteenth Corps, and was the only colored regiment in the corps. According to their own report, "they are new nigglers, but well disciplined." The position occupied by Blount's battery has been damaged by the enemy's fire and needs repairing this work is in the hands of the artillery. The ordnance officer has now been three weeks removing the 10-inch columbiad and mounting the 8-inch. It seems to me that this is a waste of valuable time, and if he will consult with me I can expedite the work. Private Joseph H. Jackson, Company I, Twenty-third South Carolina Volunteers, deserted to the enemy about 1 a.m. on yesterday.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 1. Gracie's brigade, killed, 1 wounded, 3. Total, 2 killed, 4 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
