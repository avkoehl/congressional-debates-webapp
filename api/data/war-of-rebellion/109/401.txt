VERNON, July 12, 863-2.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

The following dispatch has just been received:

Rebels have burnt Laughery Creek bridge, two miles and a half east of Osgood. We are cut now from communication east. They captured guard left there.

S. P. PEABODY.

If there is no objection, I will join General Hughes and go to Osgood to-night. I suggest dispatching a force down the Lawrenceburg Railroad.

Major-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

General WALLACE:

Dispatch received. Madison being safe, start such portion of your command for Osgood as you think necessary. What point shall I telegraph you? Where are Love and Burkham?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

General WALLACE,

North Vernon:

Please leave General Hughes on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad with his original orders to co-operate with Hobson and operate on the line of the railroad. Leave with him the mounted troops and move up to Columbus with your command and Love's. His infantry will give him sufficient strength, as Morgan's main body has passed beyond Osgood, either this way or toward Lawrenceburg. Madison is safe. General Manson is on the river near there with artillery and infantry. Tell Hughes if he can get his mounted troops on the rebels' rear to do so, and keep following them up and telegraph importance.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

VERNON, July 12, 1863-4 o'clock.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

My last dispatches show Morgan in Ripley County. He left Madison on his right. Hobson is by this time between line and Madison. I therefore venture to suggest it is no longer necessary for me to march
