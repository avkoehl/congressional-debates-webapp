From this exhibit it appears that the total infantry force, "present equipped" in the department is, in round numbers (exclusive of Helena and Fort Smith), about 12,000 men (white and colored). By concentrating the colored troops at Little Rock (except the Fifty-third and Sixty-third) and reducing the garrisons at posts below the estimate for proper defense, a detached brigade of 3,000 infantry has been organized as a movable force. This brigade is now en route to Department of the Gulf. The above total (12,000) includes the Fifty-third and Sixty-sixth Colored, which have not been transferred to the department permanently. The Fifty-third is at Saint Charles and the Sixty-sixth at Devall's Bluff; neither can be spared at present. Helena has a total force of all arms and colors of about 2,500 men. This number can be safely reduced to about 2,000. Fort Smith, &amp;c., has a total of about 6,000 men. It is hoped that this number may be reduced, but to what extent cannot now be stated, pending reports which have been called for. The above number for Fort Smith, &c., includes the Indian Home Guard Brigade at Fort Gibson (about 1,500 or paper). The Indians have applied to the War Department for muster out a month or two before the expiration of their term of service (April next), to enable them to cultivate their lands. Nothing can be expected of this brigade beyond the defense of the outposts of Fort Gibson.
