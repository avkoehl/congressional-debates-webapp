like character other than linseed or flaxsoed, half
a cent per pound.
Mr. SHERMAN. That is the same ques-
tion really.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment was to strike out lines
two hundred and eighty-nine, two hundred and
ninety, and two hundred and niuety-one, as
follows;
On linseed or flaxseed, twenty cents per bushel of
fifty-six pounds weight: Provided, That no draw-
back shall be allowed on oil cake made from im-
ported soed.
Mr. SHERMAN. That is the same ques-
tion.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment was to strike out lines
two hundred and ninety-two and two hundred
and ninety-three, as follows:
On sesame-seed oil or cenno oil, and cotton-seed
oil, thirty cents per gallon.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment was to strike out line
two hundred and ninety-four: "011 sesame-
seed, ten per cent, ad valorem."
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment was in line two hundred
and ninety-five, to strike out "on opium, one
dollar per pound."
Mr. SHERMAN. I will state that the pres-
ent duty 011 opium is $2 50 a pound, and this
reduces it to one dollar.
Mr. CAMERON. Why should it be reduced ?
Mr. SHERMAN. The committee propose
to strike out this item of the bill, so as to leave
the article under the old law.
Mr. SAWYER. I ask the Senator from
Ohio if the reason for th-e reduction is not that
the temptation to smuggle is thereby decreased,
and whether there is not a great deal of smug-
gling now in this article?
Mr. SHERMAN. It does prevail to some
extent, but it is the next item where the tempt-
ation to smuggle is greatest, the smoking
opium, the duty on which is ten dollars a pound.
We have l-educed it to six dollars.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is upon this amendment, striking out the
item.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Finance was in line tvyo hundred and ninety-
seven, to strike out "ten dollars" and insert
" six dollars 50 that the clause will read :
On opium prepared for smoking and 011 all other
preparations of opium, not otherwise provided for,
six dollars per pound: Provided, That opium pre-
pared for smoking and other preparationsot opium,
depusitedin bonded warehouse, shall not be removed
therefrom for exportation without p.iymcntofdutics,
and such duties shall not be refunded.
Mr. COLE. I do not think it will make any
difference whether the duty be ten dollars or
six dollars; the inducement for smuggling will
be about the same in one case as the other;
that is to say, it will be sufficient at six dollars
a pound to induce smuggling perhaps as much
as if it were ten dollars.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will leave it entirely to
the Senators from California. We thought tea
dollars a pound was so enormous a duty that
it would be belter to reduce it. Six dollars a
pound is considerably more than one hundred
per cent, acl valorem.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment of the committee was
to strike out lines three hundred and two and
three hundred and three, as follows:
On morphia and on all salts of morphia, one dollar
per ounce.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Committee on Finance propose in lines
one and two of section forty-eight, being the
free list, to amend, so as to read:
That on and after the 1st day of October, 1870, in
addition to imported articles now by law exempt
from duty, and not herein otherwise provided for,
the following articles hereinafter enumerated and
provided for shall ufso be free.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Thisamendment
will be regarded as agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. The committee have de-
cided to withdraw the amendment, so as to let
this free-list section go into operation on the
81st of December, as the House propose.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
will be regarded as withdrawn. ["Yes!"
"Yes!"]
The amendment was withdrawn.
INTERNAL REVENUE FEMALE CLERKS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair has
been requested to lay before the Senate a joint
resolution, which, if passed at all, requires
immediate action.

lation to female clerks in the Internal Revenue

are printed in the United States, and books
so as to read : "Books which have been printed
and manufactured more than twenty years."
Mr. SUMNER. I should like to know the
reason for striking out the words proposed by
the committee to be stricken out.
Mr. SHERMAN. The reason is manifest,
I think, to the Senator. By reading the clause
he will see that as it stands the whole duty on
books would be very easily evaded; and the
book publishers, without exception, romonstrate
against this provision above all others. Under
this clause any person might order any book
from Europe through the aid of a local agent
(here and have it remitted duty free. Book
publishers themselves could, by getting a dozen
friends to act for them, order the most expens-
ive and extravagant books, nominally for their
private use but really for sale, and thus avoid
the revenue law. The purpose for'which 0
book is to be used, after it comes here, no law
can limit.
Mr. SUMNER. But allow me to call the
Senator's attention to the qualifying termsâ€”
"of which noeditionsare printed in t.hellnited
States."
Mr. SHERMAN. Bat the booksellers very
properly say that that, could be evaded in the
easiest way. There would be a little difference,
in tho edition of the work, or soma additional
matter inserted so as to make it apparently a
different edition in order to evade the law. I
think it would be easy to evade this provision.
The committee, however, propose to admit free
of duty books which have been printed over
twenty years.
Mr. SUMNER. I consider that a very im-
portant amendment to the existing law; one
which, I am sure, will work well; but then it
