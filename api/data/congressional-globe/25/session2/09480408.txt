w !) the pnvilege of issuing   promissory  notes,
 e vuig tho papóse ot u. ljcal currencj
The advócales i the deposite system propose,
by an affiliation ot certain banks, placed by con-
trast under the supervising control of the Federal
Government, exeited by an application of the re-
venue power, to convert this local currency into a
general currency, and to impart to ¡t uniformity
Sir, the plan, at the outset, is chargeable with the
absurdity and inconsistency of piomising unifor-
mity, and actually aggravating inequality by the
mode and terms of selection. The piomised
uniformity m the multifarious and diversified paper
currencies, of so many separate communities, can
never be consummated Such is its versatility,
•uch its uncertainty and inequality, at different
times and places, that it seems to expose mathe-
matical truth to ndtcu.e and doubt. A bank note
m the cuy of Richmond may be equivalent to spe-
eie and so may another bank note, of similar de-
nomination be in St. Louis New, sir, in mathe-
matics, that things equal to the same, are equal to
each other, is a truth independent of time and
place He who should act upon this truth, in re-
ference to the two supposed bank notes, would be
egregiously deceived They are, perhaps, in no
otlwar places ,equal to the same thing, and are no
where equal to each other. The uniformity of such
variety of circulation and currency, emanating
torn the separate and independent States of this
Confederacy, can never be effected by any eonMi-
tutional application of the limited powe-s conferred
on Congress. The want and the desire of
uniformity m this various cuneney, us eleva-
tion above, or depression below, the stan-
dard of the Constitution, its tendency to exclude
gold and silver from circu'ation, its useful or
injurious functions in commeicial transactions, in
agency in disturbing or deranging the fair rate of
exchange between different parts oí the Union,
neither from one, or all of these considerations com-
bined, can any power be derived to Congress over
the subject For correction and reform in the
character of the currency of the several States, we
must, under out forms of Government, íely upon
the same authority which has bestowed the privi-
lege of creation and issue For weal or wo, in
wisdom or in folly, constitutionally or unconstitu-
tionally, the States have adopted this piper system,
they have, respectively, exclusive jurisdiction m the
regulation of their own issues, and each may wholly
exclude from circulation within its limits the issues
of any or all the rest Sir, I repeat that the great
question of reform in local banks and currency,
the great question of a revisal of the whole system
of corporation-—these great question, between Re-
publican equality and Aristocntic privilege—belong
to the States separately, and any attempt on the
part ol Congress to interfere, regulate, control, ci
settle Slate policy, directlv or indirectly, oveitly o<-
clandestinely, I denounce as an unwimntable
exercise of power Congress ought not to be per-
mitted to divide with the States the glory of achiev-
ing a radical reformation m their own peculiar local
institutions, nor ought it to desire to participate in
the cr.me of perpetuating exiting abuses by mter-
po mg the aegis of piotectic-i, upon the false aid
slanderous suggestion that, under the cloak of re-
form, the Democracy conceal the demon of destruc-
tion. Let the struggles for reform of St?te policy
be carried on, free from all unjust obtrusion and
illegal interference on the part of this Government *
I see with approbation that the eminent indivi-
dual to whom is end usted the Executive power, has
adopted this safe rule of conduct, and, ¿n his adhe-
rence to it, I tru^t confident!} that he will be tri-
umphantly sustained. The States ma's, and doubt-
less will, improve their currency, w1! cau^e it to
approximate more nearly to the constitutional
standard, will make it umfoim, an J equivalent to
gold and silver within their own limits, and without,
must leave it to depend upon its good chaiacter at
home and tne condition and wants of business I
will not doubt both the inclination and wisdom of
the States to accomplish, without Federal dictation
or prescription, the general reform so earnestly
demanded by the state of public opinion In the
fulness of time it wi 1 be accomplished     It is a

Mr. Chairman, let us briefly recapitulate the
purposes, promises, and designs, of this union of
the State Banks with the Federal Government.
It assumes the power to loan out the public
money-
It converts the State banks into Farmers Gene-
ral of the revenue
It reduces the Government to the necessity of
making requisitions on the banks for the use of its
own revenue
It effaces the line of paitition between the two
Governments
It applies national capital, rai <-d by taxation,
and multiplied four-fold, to fiuctify and sustain
national industry
It undertakes to prescribe the denomination of
notes to be issued by the State b?nks
It undertakes to restrain  and  regulate  their
issues-
It addresses, as motives of conduct, their "hopes
and fears "
It uses the public credit for "reward and pu-
nishment "
It promises to give uniformity to the whole local
currency
It nukes odious discriminations, and aggravates
its di pant)
It pioposts to recur to "existing materials,"
"Slate mst tutions," upon, which to build up a sys-
tem of Federal power
To make the most of these for the convenience
of the Government, as well as ior the general
good
To reform their abuse~, correct their defects, and
adopt evety precaution which may be necessary to
insure thtir fidelity and efficiency.
These are out an imperfect enumeration, and
where, since the days of Hamilton, can its parallel
be found7 I call to mind none, except, peihaps,
the extravaganzas of Richard Ru«h, m his f rst
annual report, as Secretaty of the Treasury
There appears to my mind so strong a resemblance,
that I cannot forego the opportunity of introducing
to the notice of the committee the enumeration of
the legitimate object  of Federal legislation con-
tained in that famous document

With an a\ow<tl of so many oljects md pur-
poses of FedeiM iegislat on, with our State institu-
tions nationalized, and drawn, by consequence of
compacts «.ml agiecnenti., within the c gmzance

ing under the Constimtion and lavs of the United
S ates, what port on ol ihe reserved rights of the
State , may we hope wi'l ultimately be saved from
encroaenment, should these alarming doctrines
obtain' Then the Republicans of tne presen  dalr,
as did the Republicans of '98, wnl have too much
cause to expre ¡s their deep regrc t, ' that a sp rit
has been manifested by the Federal G \ ¡ nment to
eniaige its powers by forced constructions of the
constitutional charter which denies tnem "
In lieu of this scheme, which has so lately failed
with a most disastrous explosion, it is proposed in
the bill befoie us, reported by the C«r" mttet ot
Wajs and Means, to organize t>eTreasury accord-
ing to the tequisittons o trie Coiislitut on My col-
league [Mr GíR[a\0] has candidly i limited th t
theieis no constitutional objection to the p'an which
we, on out side, advocate-, whilst the plan which he
o zealously derends, is sunounded with msur-
n u liable difficulties    I was glad that my col-
league did not indulge in the usual cant of charging
our bill with creating two currencies, one for the
Government, and another for the people.   Sir, it is
utterly untrue that this bill creates any currency at
all    I have heretofore adverted to the anomalous
condition of the United States on the subject of
currency,   and have shown that whilst the Con-
stitution requires a metallic currency, and autho-
rizes no  other,  the States  respectively, with or
without constitut.onal right,  have superadded a
paper currency.   Neither Congiess or thia bill is
at all responsible for the existence of two curren-
cies in the country.   The coinage of money, the
regulation of the value  thereof,  and of foreign
com, is the   imperative  duty of Congress.   The
existence of a metallic currency, therefore, is an
indispensable constitutional requisition    There is,
then, one currency, under the Constitution, which
is necessary and unavoidable, and must perform
Us intended functions, and those who are disposed
to murmur   because   there   is another currency,
which   cannot answer  all  the  same   purposes,
ought   to  go to   the source of its  creation   to
vent  their complaints  and remonstrances,   and
ought not to hurl their indignation against our bill,
which, m that particular at least, is innocent.   Our
bill is based upon the principle, that according to
the Constitution, in the payment of all dues and
debts ta the Government, gold  and sdvei ought
to be required, and  looks  to  the  ultimate esta-
blishment and general application of this princi-
ple     Although ta\atton, in its broad sense, im-
plies any species  of contribution or impost for
the support of Government, yet I presume that it
will not be contested or denied that our rates of
taxes, duties, imposts and excises, must be laid and
collected in a general medium, denominated mo-
ney.    Wc have seen that the Constitution makes
money to consist of gold and silver, and does not
authorize any other currency , this, therefore, must
be the species of money intended to be employed,
in Government purposes, by the framers of that
instrument    Money is only the standard or mea-
sute of value    Taxation is but the transfer of in-
dividual wealth or value to the Government for
its consumption.   The amount or extent of value
taken from each citizen is measured by this stand-
ard.    Entire uniformity and exact equality m ail
contributions  and  exactions cannot be attained
i tally as well as nominally, but by the use of this
common or constitutional standard or measure of
value    Specie payments ol all debts and dues to
the Government are the necessary result of requir-
ing uniformity, and employing a common and
invariable standard    In addition to the argument
resting on uniformity and a common standard, it
will be remembered that neither the States or the
Federal Government can make any thing but gold
and silver a tender in payment of debts.    Should
the  Goverrment  receive   the  paper  substitutes,
issued m the different States, in place of gold and
silver, how can it with these preserve the public
faith, and fulfil all it*, engagements at home and
ibroad, according to the termo of the Constitution 7
Should the Government receive paper at all, it
ought to be with a certainty, excluding every pos-
sibility of doubt, of its immediate conveitibihty into
gold and silver, and it ought to be so converted
invariably before disbursement     In sueh case, the
Government, as a matter of convenience  to the tax
payer, assists him in the process of converting his
paper into that medium required for the use of the
Tieaourj
As an authority for the receipt and disbursement
of a paper currency, ray colleague [Mr Gírlavd]
relies upon the construe ion given to the act of 1789
b Alegan ler Hamilton, then Secretary of the
Treasury, and to the subsequent practice of the
Govern uent In my opinion, sir, there has been a
constant tendency to depa't from the strict line of
coi stitutional duly, m the administration of the
finances, from tie commencement of the Govern-
ment, witch is mainly attrtbu able to the unfortu-
nate bias acquire I from the doctrines inculcated
