Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,November 28, 1864.

General CRAWFORD:

As the One hundred and fourth New York Volunteers is entirely without officers, I think it best to have it broken up and the men transferred to some other in your division. I wish you would submit an application to that effect, naming the regiment to which the men should be assigned. I have recommended that Major Colt be retained at the prisoners' camp till his time of service expires. He will be of no use here.

Yours, truly,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
