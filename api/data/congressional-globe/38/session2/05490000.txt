Thirty-Eighth Congress, 2d Session.

and slavery of the blacks. Perpetual and enor-
mous debt is slavery for body and mind. Hence
theinterests connected with these economical ques-
tions are of all questions those most momentous
for the future. Parties, statesmanship, union,
stability, all depend upon the manner in which
these questions are dealt with. Shall the tariff
be one of bounty or of revenue only? Shall a
Chinese policy ward off all foreign interchange
from our shores? Or shall protection, so long
abandoned by the scientific and practical men of
our generation, be again introduced into our econ-
omy? Shall taxes be levied equally on the rich
and poor? Shall the funded debtof this nation be
paid to the few in gold by the sweat of the many?
Shall labor be held in thrall and bianded as the
serf of capital ? Shall one interest or section be
pampered at the expense and poverty of another?
Shall we forever bury and keep buried the sym-
metric system of a gold and silver currency, as
the standard of the Constitution and of nature,
under the lush growth of greenbacks and paper
promises? When this war shall end, and the
present inflation has collapsed; when the " stocks
on hand" of merchant and capitalist shall have
suffered in the wreck of credit and crash of paper
money; when " settling day" shall come and the
meretricious splendors of fictitious wealth shall
fade; when the diamonds of to-day shall become
the paste of to-morrow; when speculation shall
no longer flaunt its upstart pretension in the face
of merit and modesty; when a common ruin shall
ingulf both poor and rich; when the gilded ves-
sel gliding so smoothly over this smooth summer
sea of delusive prosperity shall meet the " whirl-
wind's sweepy sway;" then who will direct the
whirlwind ana who temper the storm ? Why not
now, in the present, look these dangers in the face,
and by prescience avert them? As an adjunct in
this work, let these finance committees have time
and opportunity to do their work, and then it
may be well done. This can only be done by a
division of their labor as proposed by this amend-
ment. Whichever party deals by these questions
most nearly in the interests of labor—the procre-
ant source of all wealth and taxes—that party will
have and keep the ascendency in the political con-
trol of the Government.
There is one thingespecially which calls forthe
division of this Committee of Ways and Means.
We know that there is a complaint throughout
the country, not partisan by any means, that our
promises to pay are so various that the people,
upon whom the credit of this Government rests,
cannot readily understand them. Scarcely any
two creditors of the Government have the same
kind of promise to pay from the Government.
We have the ten-forties, the five-twenties, the
certificates of indebtedness, thclegal-tender notes,
the notes bearing interest and the notes not bear-
ing interest, securities bearing interest in gold and
securities bearing interest in paper, until scarccly
two creditors of the Government have the same
sort of obligations.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
he is very doubtful as to whether a discussion as
to the variety of thepublic securities is legitimate
on a motion to amend the rules of the House.
Mr. COX. There was never anything more
legitimate, in my judgment.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks gen-
tleman is going beyond the legitimate limits of
debate.
Mr. COX. No one has raised a question of
order.
The SPEAKER. If the gentleman's speech
is legitimate, thenadiscuSsionofeverythingcon-
nected with the finances of the Government would
be legitimate, and the Chair thinks it would not be.
Mr. COX. Perhaps the Speaker misappre-
hended me. I did notintend to argue these ques-
tions, but to state them only. I wished to show
the necessity of having these questions properly
investigated with a view to educe some order out of
this chaos. That was the tenor of my argument,
and nothing more. I do not propose to argue the
83
merits of any of these obligations. Here is the
statement from which I have deduced my argu-
ment for the proposed amendment:

Mr. BLAINE. I ask the gentleman to yield
to mo for a few moments.
Mr. COX. I will give the gentleman ten min-
utes of my time.
Mr. BLAINE. I have a little grievance, Mr.
Speaker, which may be appropriately referred to
here. At the last session of Congress I intro-
duced a resolution instructing the Committee on
the Judiciary to inquire into the expediency of
amending the Constitution so as to allow Con-
gress to levy an export tax. At the beginning
of this session the matter was referred anew to tha
Ways and Means Committee, on the suggestion
of some of its members, and from that day to this,
owtngto the great pressure of business before that'
committee, nothing has been heard of the measure.
Now, had it been allowed to remain before the
Judiciary Committee it would have been reported
long yinee and could have been fully discussed
pro and con, and a conclusion of some, kind reached
thereon. 1 had a great desire to submit some re-
marks on the subject, and though not pertinent
to tho pending question,! hope under the circum-
