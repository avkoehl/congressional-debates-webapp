command. Have no fears, but the people here are very much alarmed. I have received information reliably that Thornton was in Platte City last night. I am sending a spy there to-night that will bring me sure news to-morrow. If true, and he continues to visit there, I shall venture something to catch him, with your approval.

H. HILLIARD,

Major, Commanding.

SAINT JOSEPH, August 13, 1864.

Major HILLIARD,

Weston:

Major Cranor is probably chasing the bushwhackers. There cannot be a very large force of guerrillas in Platte County. Anderson, Downing &amp; Co. are in Caldwell County to-night, near Kingston. Your people need not be alarmed. You can whip any enemy that dare molest you. You have my approval in spying, catching, and killing Thornton.

Brigadier-General.

HAMILTON, August 13, 1864.

General FISK:

The Lexington stage which left here this morning has just returned, and reports great excitement at Knoxville and Kingston, occasioned by reported advance of a gang of some 100 bushwhackers on Knoxville, coming toward the railroad.

Operator.

KINGSTON, August 13, 1864.

General FISK:

Guerrillas between here and Knoxville moving toward Tinney's Grove, said to be 125 strong, taking the same route they did before. Lieutenant Baker and Captain Noblett are on their trail, watching their motions. They killed three men near Knoxville Court-Yard. Send me 100 men well mounted and equipped to aid me in the work. Recruiting going on finely here. Send me transportation for 100 men from Hamilton to Saint Joe.

Colonel J. H. SHANKLIN,

Bill Anderson's guerrillas attacked a militia company at Fredericksburg, Ray County, last night, and killed Captain Colley and 4 men. I have just learned from Hamilton that he is marching toward the railroad from Knoxville and Kingston. Let all your fighting material be
