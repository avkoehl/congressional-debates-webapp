the Carolinas from April 1, 1865, to May 10, 1865; * also copy of my note+ calling his attention to that part of his report in which he speaks of the necessity of maintaining his truce even at the expense of many lives, and giving him my views thereon, with permission to amend it, and his answer thereto. ++

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Washington City, May 30, 1865.

Bvt. Major General JOHN A. RAWLINS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to request that the following corrections be made in my last official report, dated May 9, 1865, already forwarded, viz: On page8 [31] of the report, referring to my letter of April 18, 1865, addressed to Major-General Halleck, substitute in lieu of the words "into his hands," the words "at Washington," and on page24 [37], before the word "received" (beginning line), insert the words "must have. "

At the time the report was written Major Hitchcock, who bore the letter in question to Washington, was not with me, and I was under the impression that he had placed the letter in question in General Halleck's own hands on the 21st of April. Having now just learned that though the letter was delivered on that day at General Halleck's former office in Washington, it arrived just after his departure for Richmond, I wish the statement to be made accordingly. But as I am satisfied, for other reasons, that my views as contained in that letter were made known to General Halleck before his dispatch of April 26 was sent, the inferences drawn in my report remain unchanged.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
