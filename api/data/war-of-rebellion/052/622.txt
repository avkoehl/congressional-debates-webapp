on the Arkansas side, with five pieces of artillery. The channel there is very tortuous, and runs under the Arkansas shore. I have telegraphed General Schofield and sent information to naval officers at Cairo. I have also informed General Schofield that if he has not force to spare he can call on you.
It is also reported that another force is coming in at Hickman's Bend. I would suggest, in case you are called on, that you send the Second Illinois Cavalry from Fort Pillow, and support them by infantry from Columbus. They must be instructed to disperse the support and capture the guns.
