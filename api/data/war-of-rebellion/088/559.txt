GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. SECOND DIV., 2nd ARMY CORPS,

No. 61. August 28, 1864.

The number of colors lost recently in this command calls for special notice from the major-general commanding the division. A written report will be required from each regimental commander losing a color on the 25th instant; and in every case where there appears to have been no adequate reason for the loss the regiment will not be permitted to carry any colors until it demonstrates in action its ability to protect them. This rule will hereafter be followed in regard to all colors lost in battle, that the absence of them may be a standing reproach to those unable or unwilling to defend them.

By command of Major-General Gibbon, commanding division:

A. HENRY EMBLER,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
