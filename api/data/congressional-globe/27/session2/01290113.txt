He understood that a bill providing for the issue of Treasury-
notes hai been introduced with a view to meet ceitam presmg
Claims upon the Treasury This being a bill, in effect, to pro
vide the ways aud means to meet the engagement*, of the
Government, he asked the liouse il it was not plain,
that any substitute for it wa-- pciiccdy germain to the matter
It wasio provide lor the ímmedi te wants of the Treasuiy by
an iSi,ue ol Tieasuy notes, and could it be pretend
ed for a moment that it was not competent foi Congress to,
appropriate the prooee is of the public land sales now in the
Treasury to that object* He held it to be a clear and undenia
ble pioposition, that the amendment was periectly in order
and of a subject matter mtimue y connected with the bill be
fore the House Iheie was a fund now in the Ireasury which,
under a former law, could not be touched, yet this fund was
on hand, and could be used mure promptly than moneysansmg
from the issue of Tieasury no'es coul 1 Now the piopo&ition
of the gentleman from Ohio was to use this fund, pro tanto,
instead of the fund to be piovided by the b 11 reported by the
Committee of Way&and Mean* II gentlemen pretended that
it was not competent for Congress to lepeal the Dis rthutim
act—if they could estab!ish that ¡actio the satisfaction of the
House, why ifceir ouje nuns mi£,ht have some weight, but if
they had powei to repeal that act, as was admitted by all—if
they had thp power to rai^e monty to supply the \iants of the
Government by an issue of ireasury note*—it was clear to his
mind that they could subs Uuie the one fund loi the othei It
appeared to him thrt the amendment wis so cleirly in nider
that he could only wonder that any gent.cman could bung his
mini to duuutit

Mr A V BROW N had to ma\e a few ob^erv itions on this
question of ordei—on no othei eubject did he wish to make a
single remark The ommai bill piovidtd foi the i^ue of
Treasury notes, or, in c trier wor is, cieated a debt against the
United States Ihe whole anendment proposed i mode by
Which that debt &ho dd bp p ud hy furnish ng a fund to provide
for the notes that aie to be issued Now was there anvboit of
incongruity between the two subjects, when the oiiginalbill
proposed to crea e a debt, and the amendment ptoposed to
provide a fund for the payment of it lie undeistoud the Chair
to say that it was in the powei ot the Hou-e 1> mcorpoiate a
provision lttthe bill, sitting apau a parueulai fund to meet the
debt tobe cieated, bur, that it < o ¡11 nor he d ne m the shape oí
thepiesent amendment,mu,much as it propo&ed tnepealan
existing )iw oí the ¡and I tl i-, 1 e would answer, that by
pledging certain furds at the disposal of the Coveinnu rit, it was
in Older for the Ilou-e to m ke tl i> provision Now he would
ask tue question, suppose the amendment of the Senator dom
Ohio declared that thepiuceeds ot the customs loi the ntxt
three months be applied n thi paymmt of this debt, woul I
any gentleman n-e up a d say that such an amend
ment would be lncongiuous and dieielore oufofoidej* But
suppose Con?tebs, was of posed to p'edgu s the r ustons foi
ihi> object, and preleiied plowing the pioceeu=>ol the pubic
land sales for the next thiet months, H he undeibtnod any thing
of paihamentaiy law, the out. amen Iment was i reci^eiy like
theothei If, howovei, the pubhc land salesior the neYt si^c
n  i hi. should be pledged why then thr law of the last tension
Utc he Distribution ol the same among the States would stnrd
leppaled of course But because the amendment wasjtmed to
tht, tt peal of the law, gentlemen had lalitn into th* error that it
wasiuongiuous, and out ofordei If the subject ol the amend
niisnt wab within th  pio\m<eot ihu House, why it was only
the wudemal consequence ihat the ¡aw would b repealed, a id
not the obj ctofth   amendment

The question wa* uen propounded,' ^hali hcdo-i ion ol the

So the decision of the Chair wis affirmed
[A message was received from the Senate, asking the concur*
lenceof the House m certain bills passed by that body See
Senate proceedings ]
Mr COOPER of Pennsylvania warned the romrmttee that it
was not his intention to inflict a long or set ppeerh upon them,
he rose butbnefiy tosíate the groutds on which h* should op
pose the bill now under censideration He had, heretofoie,
though under different circumstances, avowed his decided op
position to the issue of Treasury notes, and he had done so be
cause he believed that, as a meana of supplying ihe wants of
the Treasury, it was insidious m i s diameter and tended to
undue extravagance in the adminis ration of Government So
long as a G>veinmem was able to relieve its waits by the
emi=s on of Treasury notes, it would not be very n! ply to tro
vernitsplfby the principles of economy, but if it were com
pel led, on fhe contiary, to report to loans, it would hid itself
under aneceesity of shunning extravagant and jroflftte t\
penditure This was one of the considera ions whuh hid
actuated him in opposing the system Bt * there weie o hers
no less worthy ofconsideiation, to t\hich hevv^uld biiefly ad
vert, without'entenng further into them
As piacttcal statesmen, they were callea i.pon to pr iide
means to relieve the pressing wants of the Tre^ iry t isall
must admit, but, in sdlectmg those means * vere bound
to adopt surh as, while they furnished a supp > o meet the ex
lgencies of the Treasury, would at the ''arríenme piomote the
prosperity and advance the true interests nf ihe people The
question now to be looked at was thi« Will Tiea^uty notes
have this effect to the sime extentas a loan"1 If not, then Con*
£ie-swas bound to reject the one and acloftthe o her Every
body knew th it, should Trea^uiv notes be tecnicd with an mte
ip=it of =!ix per cent they would soon find their "way into the
pickets ofcapitalisf?, and never would get in'o genenl encu
lation hut, should a loan be negotiated, either it hi me or
abioad—morfesppcially ii obtained abroad -the imnu'at would
obtain genital circulation in the country, and thus ihe paper
money maiket would be propoitionably re!ie\ed ard thus the
people would be benefited at the bimo time with the Gjvern
menL   Tor this reason Mr C wa<?in favor of a loan
But the committee were told hy the honorable chairman
ofthe Committee of Ways and Means that the Govein
ment was in a state of embarrassment, and snch embar-
rassment as reqnned immediate íehef It might le so,
if the chairman stated this to be the ca^e he had no doi bt that
it was hc, hut let it not be forgotten that embaí raiment e\ end
ed beyond the Government alone the pame embana^rnent,
tbo same i eed of immediate relief, was prts&mg on th* people
in an equal degree If the Government was to be relit ved, let
the people be relieved too, a loan would operate to relieve
both
Mr C sa'd he was not surprised to see gentlemen belonging

In votes of yea and nay At e"\ erv^tep the bat tie was rprewed
They first opposed getting the bill into committee and, when
defeated in this by the suspension of the rules, they made fight
again on taking the bill into the House, then on the previous
question, then on ordering the bill to its third reading, and
again on its final passage, when hut 5 out of 110 or 112
Whig votes were cast m its. favor But one short year had
elapsed, and now the very same men who had Chen so reso-
lutely opposed the measure, were the first to bring it forward
and give it their support He was not merely surpnsed, he
was confounded at such aspectacle
Mr C had opposed Treasuiy notes on principle, and not
f'om any factious opposition to Martin Van Buren Jfe had
been always against them as leading the Government to ex*
ttaVdgatiLe, asan insidious means of creating a put he debt,
oí the existence of which the people were not sensible till it
was unavoidably fastened upon them.
But it was said that we must issue Treasury notes because a
loan could no* be obtained m the countiy, and if we got it at
all, we must ob am it in the forei n money market, which
would requite tlnee or lour months' delay, ard m the mean
tune the Governme: t would be left without funds to meet its
engagements But let gentlemen lecoliectthat the entire Ame-
rican people were m the like condition, that multitudes of
cred tois had not merely had ihetr clams postponed, hut had
lost them altogether Let gentlemen compare the condition ot
the people wild that of the Government, and wren they ie«
fleeted or this? a delay of three or four months would not be
su much deprecated Was the exigency of the Government
grpaiprthan thatof the whole people? He hoped some advo-
cate of the bill would remember and reply to this question,   ^
It was no reason for the issue oí Ti easury notes that Martm
Van liuien had been ejected bom power, md that another Ad-
mimsudfinn hai succeeded to that then in po-ses«¡on of the
Goveinmtnt Mr C wis not bure but a little adveisity might
teach the Government tnrftwhici Hierre 1 to hive been unable
to [parn from the overwhelmn g elections of the las' ¡all, viz
that it mu ««I lemrn t'i Whig treasures aid that ti is was the
oV y means of cencihatn _ to itself the c nil en e of die nation.

Mr C did not intend to indulge in any language disrespectful
to tht Government, but he should like tosce it reselling to such
nwamues as would piomote not n eiely its own convenience,
but the good of thp ppoplpalso Buta<mn he must say he hi d
