IMMIGRATION CONVENTION.
Mr. FINKELNBURGr, by unanimous con-
sent, presented the memorial^ of the Indian-
apolis Immigration Convention; which was
referred fco the Committee on Commerce, and
ordered to be printed in the Globe.
The memorial is as follows :
To the honorable the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the United States in Congress assembled:
Your memorialists would respectfully represent
that a convention in the interest of immigration
was held at Indianapolis the 23d day of November,
1870, at which the undersigned were elected as a
committee to lay before your honorable body, the
views of the convention and ask for such legisla-
tion at your hands as will correct the evils of which
wo complain. We would state that the convention
which wo have the honor to represent consisted ot
tick gales from twenty-two States and one lerritory,
ami that it was composed, in a great measure, or men
HMn-esL-nting the different benevolent societies 01 the
country organized in the interest of this subject, and
>11en who, tor many years, have been familiar with
t lie i ouuirements incident to the care and transport-
ation of immigrants from .Europe to the United
In presenting to you the views of the convention
we would stato their belief that immigrants are fre-
Quently I'laeed in badly-ventilated ships, supplied
with insufficient food, and deprived of the necessary
means of securing personal cleanliness, and unpro-
vided with proper medical attendance; and even in
the better class of vessels, where proper sanitary reg-
ulations are enforced, the laws of the United States
are often violated by over-orowding t'hestcorage.
Your memorialists believe that like and even
greater evils exist in the inland transit of immi-
grants, and they would call especial attention to the
fact that by'Jar the greater number of immigrants
landing at our sea-ports pass almost immediately to
the western and southwestern States and Territories;
and that during this transit they are subjected to
many abuses which are detrimental to both their
health and comfort, such as being crowded into cars
insufficiently ventilated, without fire in winter or
â€¢vvator in summer, and not affording sufficient facili-
ties for obtainingcheap and wholesome food; being
unnecessarily delayed at way-side stations, where
they lind no protection from the heat of summer or
coldof winter; being sent by circuitous rou tesin order
to accommodate favored railroad? and steamboat
companies; being enticed by di&honost runnels into
disreputable boarding-houses against their wishes
and interests; notbeingallowed to have their baggage
checked through, and thereby frequently losing the
same; being insulted and plundered by dcck-hands
and thieves on the river and lake steamers; and. in
fact, suffering everything that men, women, and
children can suffer, who, ignorant of our laws and
language, are unable to protect themselves, and do
not receive proper protection irom the Government.
The annual report of the commissioners ot emi-
gration of the State of Now York for the year ending
December 8. 1869, fully confirms, in the minds of
your memorialists, the belief that it has become the
imperative duty of the national Government to carry
out the humanitarian designs of the convention wo
represent as expressed in the resolutions accom-
panying this memorial.
They would also call attention to the annoyances
and hardships imposed upon immigrants by the
action ot custom-house inspectors. It has been
alleged that the property of immigrants is often
seized on slight pretext, and either confiscated or
detained so long as to subject the owner to great
expense and loss of time in securing its release. As
the present inspectors speak only English, conti-
nental immigrants find great difficulty in ascertain-
ing what ai tides are dutiable and for what amount.
Your memorialist are convinced that if anational
bureau of immigration, for useful and practical in-
formation to the immigrants, and a board of commis-
sioners could be established, it would secure to the
imiuigiants the caie and protection of the General
Government from the time they land upon ourshores
until they reach their destination in such portion of
tiie United States as they may have selected for
future homes.
We believe that this can be best accomplished by
placing the control of this matter in the hands of
honest and eUicieuf" Federal agents, whose duty shall
be to direct and guide the immigrants whiloin tran-
sit, as well as to interpose in their behalf whenever
they may suffer wrong or require assistance, and we
believe that the labors of such officers would bo
greatly facilitated by secuiing the cooperation of
men who may be selected by the different State and
territorial governments, especially from the exist-
ing emigrant societies, to look after the interests of
the immigrants seeking their respective localities,
men who should be chosen for their integrity, intel-
ligence, and humanity, and who would bo ready at
all times to aid the Government bureaus with their
counsel and influence.
We would furthermost earnestly recommend that,
in tho framing of such a law as has been here indi-
cated, a provision, in substance as follows, should be
incorporated therein, namely:
"That no person shall be qualified to fill any office
under such law who shall be directly or indirectly
interested in any corporation or company having
lands for sale to immigrants, or in the carrying or
transportation of immigrants, either from foreign
countries to tho United States and its Territories, or
within the same, or who shall receive any fee or
reward, or the promise thereof, for any services
performed or any benefit rendered to any person or
persons, in the line of his duty under such act. And
that any officer who shall violate such provision
shall, upon conviction, be punished by both fine and
imprisonment, and forever after be ineligible to hold
any office of honor, trust, or profit of the United
States."
The convention has also instructed your memo-
rialists to call the attention of your honorable body
to the custom of imposing an indhect tax upon im-
migrants, which prevails at tho pert of New York
and other ports of the United States.
Your memorialists believe this to be wrong jn
principle, at variance with all ideas of sound polit-
ical economy, and contrary to the spirit of our insti-
tutions. If any seaport orany State of the United
States has the right to impose a capitation fax of
$2 59 upon every immigrant landed, they have the
same rightto require the payment of $2 50 per head
or to make the tax so heavy as to become prohib-
itory altogether. Or if New York or California pos-
sess the rightto impose a tax, either direct or indirect,
upon immigrants landing within their respective
jurisdictions or passing through their domain, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, and every other Stato certainly
possesses the same right, and, should they each see
proper to exercise it, the immigrants would be
practically debarred from the privilege of seeking
homes in the farther West.
The deep interest which the people of the whole
country manifest in these matters wc have endeav-
ored to present leads your memorialists to hope that
your honorable body will take sucli action as in your
wisdoul may be deemed necessary to' correct th"se
abuses, to which your attention is called by1 tbeime-
inorial of the undersigned, and by the report adopted
with almost entire unanimity by the convention w-e
represent. . - -
