HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE, June 15, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The Ninth Corps has passed, and the Artillery Brigade of the Sixth Corps is now passing. The bridge works admirably, it is 2,000 feet long, so I have not yet material here for another. I will report to you the completion of the passage of each corps. I have been informed that the Second Corps covers the whole front as a tete-de-pont on a radius of some two to two miles and a half.

HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE, June 15, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

As far as I learn, about two-thirds of the Sixth Corps have passed over, but nothing has passed over for one hour, and no troops are near the bridge.

H. W. BENHAM.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 15, 1864.

Brigadier General H. W. BENHAM:

I have to request that you will permit Captain Pitkin to pass above your brigade with his transports if he arrives in time, and to notify him to stop on this shore in the neighborhood of Douthat's, on this side the river. If he arrives too late let him come to anchor below. General Meade wishes him to construct a landing at Douthat's. I would suggest to you the expediency of asking the gun-boats to stop all vessels, so that they will not interfere with your brigade.

Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac, Fort Powhatan:

Can you spare us pontoons for 250 feet of bridge without detriment to the service? If so, please send them up at once by first boat. We can get along without them, but it would be very much more convenient with them.
