WASHINGTON, April 17, 1865.

General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I most sincerely thank you for your encouragement.* It is duly appreciated. Thee have been two meetings of the cabinet. So far things move along harmoniously. I hope you will communicate with me fully in reference to all that pertains to the public interest.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, April 1865-2 p. m.

(Received 8 p. m.)

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

The freedom of Virginia from occupation by an armed enemy renders the occupation of East Tennessee in large force longer unnecessary. You may commence the withdrawal of the Fourth Corps to Nashville immediately. It is desirable to hold all the territory we now have in sufficient force to protect it against roving bands that may yet infest the country, but all force not necessary for that collect near Nashville as rapidly as possible, the Fourth Corps intact.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, April 17, 1865-8 p. m. (Received 11.35 p. m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch of 2 p. m. this date received. Will immediately make arrangements to withdraw the Fourth Corps from East Tennessee to the vicinity of Nashville.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
