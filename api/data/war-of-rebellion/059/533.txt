Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

This is the message referred to in cipher of yesterday:

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 27, 1864-11.30 a.m.

General W. T. SHERMAN:

I have intelligence from the Watauga expedition. As was anticipated, the rebels destroyed the bridge after being driven it by our cavalry. The river was too high to be forded. Our loss in the fight was 3 killed and 18 wounded; that of the enemy not yet reported. The troops will reach Lick Creek to-night. They have destroyed all the bridges from Bull's Gap to the Watauga, and about 20 miles of the track. Considering the time allowed them, think they have done remarkably well, and all that could be desired.

Keep your movements from the press as much as possible. Let the enemy find out our movements through their own spies, not ours. Thomas is all right and McPherson is coming.
