pean countries, giving the distances. I do not
see that they are any cheaper than the same
service is performed in this country, and in
many instances they are much higher.

When the shortness of the distances in
European countries, as compared with ours, is
considered; when it is recollected that they do
not pay their employes on an average more
than from one third to one half as much as we
have to pay ours, and when we recollect fur-
ther that the great mass of the telegraphic
communication everywhere are along the lines
of railroads, all of which on the continent of
Europe aie monopolized and controlled by the
Governments, while ours are all in private
hands, they being thus enabled to cause the
same official to perform telegraphic and other
duties on the lines without additional cost, it
will be readily seen how and why they can and
ought to manage their lines more cheaply than
we can or would if Government took control
of them. If Mr. Palmer is correct when he
says in his report that twenty-five thousand
additional officials would be required to man-
age this business, the cost would be for wages
alone not less than §25,000,000 a year. We
pay ordinary messenger boys in the Depart-
ments now $840 a year, female copyists $900,
and the lowest and cheapest grade of male
cleika, for not over six hours' work, per day,
$1,200; and it is fair to assume the average
annual wages of the twenty-five thousand tele-
graphic employes would notbeless than $1,000
each. ,
I believe the annual deficit which the tax-
payers of the country wouid have to make up
to support the governmental system as pro-
posed in the biil urged by the Postmaster
General, being really that of General Wash-
burn, would greatly exceed the estimate of
Mr. Hubbard or Mr. Palmer. On page 154
of the report Mr. Iiubbard said, in answer to a
question:
" I do not think you can buy the existing linos for
less than 830,000,000: now lines for the new business
will cost nearly as much: provision must also be
made for twenty per cent, increase of new lines every
year. Interest on the cost of these lines and exten-
sion and loss on the business would make the total
not less than eight or ten million dollars a year.
1 do not believe the country would assume an annual
deficiency of $8,000,000 for the benefit of ono million
three hundred thousand people, the entire number
that would- use the telegraph under the cheapest
rates," ► * * * * * * * _
" Mr. Washisukn. But would the public be willing
to make up the deficiency, as in the case of the re-
duction of letter postage?
"Mr. I1uubari>. ThetwocasesarocnUrely unlike.
Rowland Hill showed to the community that the
* actual cost of transportation from London to Edin-
burg was only one thirty-sixth of a penny, avid this
was the average of all letters throughout theUnitcd
Kingdom.' "
The last remark of Mr. Hubbard calls up a
fact not to be overlooked. Gentlemen are
too apt to assume that the increased number
of messages which would be sent under the
cheaper rates would greatly increase the reve-
nue and compensate for the reduction of
charges, as in the case of cheap postage on
letters. That is not the fact. The wires have
a limited capacity, oniy one message can go
over the same wire at a time, and whenever
an increase of business renders it necessary,
additional wires and often additional poles
have to be erected. The experience all over
Europe and in America, as shown by Mr.
Orton in detail, on page 12 of the report, is
that an increase of one hundred per cent,
in business increases the expenses from eighty
to ninety per cent. While the other gentlemen
make it less, they seem to concede that the
expenses are increased from fifty to sixty per
cent. Not so in the transportation of mail
matter; it makes very little difference to a
stage-coach, and especially to a railroad train,
whether the mail-bags contain one or ten thou-
sand letters, while the revenues of the Post
Office Department are increased tenfold if ten
thousand instead of one thousand are sent.
While, as Rowland Hill showed and proved,
when urging the penny postage, a letter could
be and was being transported four hundred
miles at a cost to the Government of one
thirty-sixth of a penny, it is equally true, and
as clearly proved by the experience even of
Belgium—and I take Belgium because she is
held up as the model in the economical man-
agement of the telegraph—that a message can-
not be sent on an average of fifty miles for less
than seventeen and a half cents, and that au
increase in business necessarily produces a
proportionate increase of expenses; so that
any comparison between ordinary letter-post-
age and telegraphic messages is a delusion
gentlemen need not indulge in, as I confess I
did when the subject was first presented to me.
It must not be forgotten that there are many
features of our telegraphic system, peculiar to
American habits, customs, and mode of trans-
acting business, which have grown up along
with it, aud have become an essential part of
it, wliich would necessarily Tie destroyed by
the governmental system, under which a Gov-
ernment official is required to transact and
superintend all business, and transmit all dis-
patches in the order in which they are received
at his office. I allude to the commercial news
bureau, the dispatches of bankers and brokers,
the dispatches to different press associations,
and other special interests, which are accommo-
dated and arranged with in a variety of ways
without material detriment to the general pub-
lic, and, so far as market and other news is
concerned, greatly to their advantage. For
example, instruments and connecting wires
are kept in gold-rooms, stock and other boards,
and in the private offices of bankers and bro-
kers, by which business is greatly expedited
and facilitated. Mr. Palmer, in his report,
speaking of these interests, says:
" It is essential for the business interests of the
country that the reports of the commercial bureau,
and the telegrams of bankers, brokers,and cotton
dealers, should be sent as they now are.
" Telegrams relating to sickness, death, and trans-
actions requiring dispatch, should also have priority
of transmission, while many social and business mes-
sages, especially between distant points, can be
transmitted, with ordinary dispatch, as well by night
as by day."
The plan of the Postmaster General, pre-
sented by General Washburn, not only does
not propose to send those dispatches as they
are now sent, or allow the present facilities
to exist, but he makes their existence and the
preferences given to them the ground of special
complaint and one of the principal reasons for
assuming governmental control ot the system.
Nearly all these things are purely American.
Mr. Iiubbard, who hasspentagreat deal oftime
in Europe investigating the whole subject, tells
us that our system of operating through com-
mercial bureaus, bankers, brokers, and others,
at points distant from each other, and buying
and selling on market reports, is almost, if not
wholly, unknown in Europe, especially on the
Continent.
I csm see no good reason why all this should
be overthrown. I know it is alleged that mar-
kets may be controlled, news withheld, and
false reports circulated to affect markets and
prices for the benefit of private parties, espe-
cially in our intercourse with foreign nations
in times of war, or feveiish excitement iti money
orproduce, under the present system. That may
be true, but it will be equally trueunder gov-
ernmental management, unless it is assumed,
which it can hardly be on any known facts or
past experiences, especially in our post office
and internal revenue service, that Government
employes are more honest or are likely to be
more carefully selected with a view of integrity
or special qualifications for the required ser-
vice than the agents or employes of private
individuals or corporations. I think the re-
verse is true, and that every gentleman in the
House knows it. But it is almost impossible
to suppress or prevent information of any im-
portance, even if operators are so disposed, if
any telegrams are allowed to pass over the
lines.
In the struggle to make money and obtain
advantages men are very fruitful in resources.
Many of the important dispatches are in cipher,
or in letters or figures which" none but the
holder of the key can possibly understand,
and the simplest statement, such as, '• I sail
for America to-morrow," or "My family are
all well," may mean "War is declared," or
" Buy for me wheat, stocks, or bonds;" and no
operator can by any possibility guess at the
true meaning of the words used, as between
the parties using them. I regard the fact that
so little of that sort of fraud has been perpe-
trated or attempted in the past as the higlit st
evidence that it will not be in the future. 'I he
interest of the owners of the lines would be
