Mr. ARCHER. I wish to ask the gentle-
man who reports this bill whether it does not
propose to introduce into our pension system
a new class of pensioners, persons engaged in
the revenue marine service, who are really
civil employes of the Government, a class
whom we have never heretofore pensioned ?
Unless there is some particular reason in this
case, and unless there is a report showing the
facts, I think it would be well to recommit the
bill.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. It appears to be a
bill of the same character as that which we
yesterday laid on the table.
Mr. DAWES. I understand that there are
some peculiar facts about this case.
Mr. ARCHER. If there is a report accom-
panying the bill I would like to have it read.
The report was read. It refers to the peti-
tion as setting forth the fact, which is sustained
by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
dated April 20, 1872, that Captain Morsell en-
tered the revenue marine service November
25, 1852, as acting third lieutenant, and after
passing through all the different grades of the
revenue marine service, was commissioned-a
captain July 11, 1864. His time of service
extended over a period of thirteen years, from
1852 to 1866, during which time he was at-
tached to vessels in the Chesapeake bay, and
at New London, Connecticut, and at New
York. He was constantly on duty with the
exception of short furloughs, and was in active
service at the time of his death. He rendered
very important service, for which he received
the thanks of Captain T. S. Fillebrown, of the
United States Navy.
Mr. ARCHER. I withdraw my objection
to the bill. I merely wanted to see whether
it was founded on sufficient reasons.

read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
