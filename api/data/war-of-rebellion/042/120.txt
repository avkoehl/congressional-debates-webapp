to employ a certain force to aid him in enforcing the enrollment of conscripts and the securing of deserters, I feel it my duty to state that, from information daily received by me, some such step is absolutely necessary.

Should this step be delayed much longer, I fear very serious consequences will grow out of it. There is also a very large amount of public property of a most valuable character needing protection.

I will most cheerfully render very assistance in my power to bring about a prompt execution of the law, both against deserters and shirking conscripts.

I am, yours, very respectfully,

F. R. LUBBOCK,

MOBILE, ALA., July 23, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Large naval force now assembling at Pensacola.

I expect this place will be soon attacked. Pleas hurry forward my ordnance stores - requisitions forwarded.

I will need some 12,000 to 15,000 re-enforcements.

Colonel B. S. EWELL:

Four companies of Seventeenth Alabama are guarding bridges near Quitman, Red Bluff, Shubuta, and Bucatunna Stations, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. I must withdraw them, as they are artillerists. Can you send troops to replace them?

Can't you stop sending prisoners through here? They interfere with transportation, consume supplies, &amp;c.
