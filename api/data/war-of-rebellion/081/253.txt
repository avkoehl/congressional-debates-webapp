HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 20, 1864.

Major VAN BUREN,

Aide-de-Camp:

MAJOR: In compliance with for approximate casualties in this command during engagements of 16th, 17th, and 18th instant, I have the honor to make the following report: June 16 and 17, estimate killed, wounded, and missing, 300. June 18, First Brigade (Second not engaged), per return, 164, Total, 464.

Returns of the casualties of the 16th and 17th are incomplete, because of the fall on the 18th of commanding officer and assistant adjutant-general of the First Brigade, Second Division. The actual loss of the Second Brigade on those dates was, killed, wounded, and missing, 11 commissioned officers and 143 men. The loss of the First Brigade may possibly exceed this, but not greatly. I have set down the entire loss of the division in round numbers at 300.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[First indorsement.
GENERAL: Please separate this return into three columns-killed, wounded, and missing.

Respectfully,

J. L. VAN BUREN,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

The loss of the First Brigade on 16th and 17th is but a guess, and there is nothing to show the proportion of killed to wounded. Do not know whether or not there were any prisoner.

I have had imperfect reports in from both brigades, and take my estimate from that. The actual report, which will be sent you to-morrow morning, will probably exceed this number some. the proportion of officers lost is about 1 to 20 (comparing with the whole loss).

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
