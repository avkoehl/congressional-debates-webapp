SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. BRECKINRIDGE'S CORPS,Numbers 26. Missionary Ridge, November 22, 1863.

Brigadier-General Bate will move his division immediately after sunset this evening and rest his right at or near Moore's house on our present line of intrenchments. Major-General Stewart will, at the same hour, deploy his reserve troops, and place them in continuation of his present line so as to fill, as nearly as possible, the gap between his right and Brigadier-General Bate's left.

Should the two divisions not, by these dispositions, cover the whole line from Moore's house to Chattanooga Creek, Generals Stewart and Bate will place such troops in the interval between their commands as in their judgment they may think necessary to give the line sufficient strength. Details will be made from the above-named divisions to keep up, during the fore part of the night, fires along the line vacated this evening by the troops of Major-General Cleburne.

By order of Major-General Breckinridge:

JAS. WILSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
