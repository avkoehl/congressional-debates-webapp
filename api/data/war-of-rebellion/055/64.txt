cowardice and desertion, that he had fully satisfied you these charges were erroneous, and you had thereupon ordered him back to this department. Thomas then directed him to remain in Nashville till further orders. Colonel McKibbin, additional aide, under arrest for attempting to break through pickets while drunk, was yesterday released by Thomas on condition he should apply to be relieved from duty in this department. Ewing's division, while encamped at Trenton, sent detachment up Lookout Mountain by way of Johnston's Crook. Reached top on the 20th without opposition; returned same night. Deserter who came in yesterday reports that Stevenson's troops, who are occupying the mountain, fell back before Ewing's men, refusing to fight, because they said they had not been exchanged. Bragg sent additional re-enforcements to Longstreet three days ago.

CHATTANOOGA, November 23, 1863-10 a.m.

The continued movement of Sherman, Thomas, and Howard, which should have been executed Saturday morning, November 20, is still paralyzed by the fact that Woods' division, of Fifteenth Corps, is still behindhand, its advance having scarcely reached the mouth of Lookout Valley, while its rear guard is still far back on the road to Bridgeport. A lamentable blunder has been committed in moving Sherman's forces from Bridgeport, with the enormous trains they brought from West Tennessee following in usual order in rear of each division, instead of moving all the troops and artillery first. Grant says the blunder is his; that he should have given Sherman explicit orders to leave his wagons behind; but I know that no one was so much astonished as Grant on learning they had not been left, even without such orders. It is yet doubtful whether the movement can be executed by to-morrow morning, and though Sherman's troops have been carefully concealed in the valleys on the northern shore of the Tennessee, it is impossible that the enemy, who has seen them march through Lookout Valley, should not have discovered where they have been placed. Meanwhile the evidence that Bragg is retreating from Chattanooga to a line covering the communications of Longstreet accumulates. Rebel families in the vicinity of Harrison have for some days been moving south.

A lieutenant of Thirty-seventh Tennessee Infantry, who deserted Saturday, reports that everything in Bragg's lines indicated retreat Yesterday the railroad east of Missionary Ridge was unusually active during the day, and troops and trains were seen moving eastward over the ridge from Chattanooga Valley. Last night two deserters came in at midnight reporting that Bragg's artillery had been sent off; that the trains were all ordered in from up Chattanooga Valley; that the troops were moving off, and that by this evening only a picket line would be left here in our front. Grant has ordered reconnaissance to ascertain truth of these reports. Steamer Dunbar was running last night, catching rafts sent down to break our bridges. River very high. While at Trenton Ewing destroyed Gustavus W. Smith's extensive new iron-works. Rain threatened.
