require it. I have directed operators to be up all night to receive orders. Have you anything later from the rebels? Large numbers of prisoners are arriving here.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 24, 1863.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

We have received the news of Morgan's approach to Cadiz, but since then have another dispatch from Barnesville, saying he was approaching Hendrysburg, on National road. We think he will make for the Ohio at Hendrysburg.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 24, 1863.

Governor TOD:

Shackelford was close upon the rear of Morgan to-day, and I hope he will overtake him to-night. He was at Washington when last heard from, and Morgan was at antrum, turning down toward Sunfish, on the river. I have sent two bodies of cavalry, by rail, to Bellaire, to move out in his front. Major Rue is there by this time. When will you be able to leave Gallipolis for this place?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 24, 1863.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

It is now understood that Morgan crossed the railroad at Campbell's Station, where he destroyed everything, and it is possible that he will go out by the National road,, and try to cross below Wheeling. I yesterday ordered three or four light-draught boats to be armed with artillery and infantry, to patrol, and sent Colonel Wallace in that direction. I hope the cavalry train will report as soon as it arrives at Newark.

Will telegraph you soon.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 24, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

What, if anything, further od you hear from John [H.] Morgan?

A. LINCOLN.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, July 24, 1863-11 p. m.

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

Just now we have conflicting reports as to Morgan's whereabouts. One report places him within 10 miles of Cadiz Junction, and the other between Antrum and Hendrysburg. Shackelford is close after him, and we will try to have forces in his front, whichever report is correct.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
