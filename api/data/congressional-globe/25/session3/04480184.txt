25th Cong ...3d Sess.                         Interference in Elections—-Mr. Norvett.                                              Senate.
in imperial robes, crowned with the glittering
diadem of royalty, and trampling ijown the free-
dom of the nation Sir, language of this kind,
on an occasion affording so little pretext for it,
indicates a feverish state of feeling, which lias
driven the judgment of the honorable Senator
from its moorings, but which may readily be ex-
plained by the peculiar circumstances in which
he has been placed by a change of political posi-
tion
I concur with him in the importance of this
proposition. It does, sir, strike at the liberties
of a large portion of your most enlightened and
most honored citizens It does demonstrate the
madpess of party. It does prove that even in
this sacred Hall, consecrated to equal and just
legislation, an odious despotism over the right to
speak and toact can be entertained It does ex-
hibit a disposition here to imitate the invidious
and despotio4egislation of the British Parliament
But, sir, I trust that a majonty of this body will
always oe found prepared to resist all such ptop-
ositions.and that they will peimit no demagogue
to drag the Senate into such palpable infiactiotis
of the Constitution The honorable Senator com
plains that the report not only justifies the officei s
of Government in the exercise of the common
right which btlongs to every citizen, but incites
them to intermeddle in elections Sit, the report
propeily incites them to assert and vindicate thi u
equal lights, attempted to be violated by this bill,
and they would be unworthy of the character of
American citizens, if they did not maintain those
rights with manly firmness
The Senatoi piofessis to be uninformed of the
extent to which modern Demociaoy admits of an
infusion of Fedeiahsm into it My friend from
New Jersey is quite able to defend himself from
these insinuations But 1 will tell the honoiable
Senator that his Democracy, his Republicanism,
appears to have received a sufficient infusion of
Conservatism to spoil its former purity, that, in-
deed, it has been merged in the modern Federal-
ism with Which the Conseivatism of associated
•wealth so naturally amalgamates
Sir, the honoiable Senator alleges that the
hill befoieyou is of little lmpoitanu , that the íe-
port upon it presents the ti ne issue to the Se nate
1 do not wonder that gentlemen are anxious to
divert public attention horn this bill of pains nnd
penalties It cannot bear the touchstone of pub-
lic sentiment but no artifice can be peimitted to
change the issue fiom the bill to the icpoit The
bill, sir, 19 the thin^ upon which the Senile has
to give its vote, and the people to pronounce
theirjudgment The íepoit will take caie of it-
self It is but a fair, loicible, and timmphint
commentaiy on the bill, and will prove an extin-
guisher to it
The Sc nator dc clares that the language of the
report, inciting the people to a resistance of the
provisions of this bill, is rank radicalism Sir,
radicalism has always been chaiged upon all op-
positions lo tyranny, to bank monopolies, and to
ul! other austoctatic tendencies, and if hostility,
if resistance, to this unjust and aibitrary bill, be
radicalism, the whole mass of the people will, I
trust, entitle themselves to the name of radicals
The honorable Senator has imbibed, from his
new position, fiesh tenors of Executive jiition
age and of the Executive veto He tells us that
no King of England, foi one hunched years, has
dared to Veto an actof Paihament that if he had
done so, a storm of public indignation would
have swept him from his thione It is easy, sir,
to understand the present dnft of the honorable
Senator That gentleman sustained General
Jackson m his administration throughout He
has frequently,stnce he left his fnend, called into
requisition the example and authonty of that il-
lustrious patriot against the measures proposed
on this side of the Senate He supported the
lesolution expunging a previous vote of the Sen
ate against General Jackson No whispei of
disapprobation was breathed by him in this Sen-
ate m relation to the Executive veto upon the
bank and distribution bills
Sir, the Senator has gained new light from new
associations, and, after the alleged mischief has
been done by the exercise of the executive veto,
after he has participated in sustaining that veto,
the honorable gentleman is now exerting him-
self to raise that storm of public indignation,
which, he hopes, will sweep the Republican party,
with whom he once piofessed it to be his pride
to act, from their ascendency in the councils of
the nation Sir, I regret to say, that our political
history has furnished too many exam-pies for the
imitation of the Senator He has too easily
yielded to them But I will tell him, for his con-
solation, that few Republican leaders who have I
gone over to the enemy have suivived their de-
sertion with reputation, few have acquned the |
honors, fewer still the confidence, of the Repub-
lican party of the country Unless he íetiace
his steps, the Senatoi will have to look else-
wheie for confidence, he will have to rely upon
other suffrages foi the gratification of his ambi-
tion
The Senator, if I understood him, committed
a great mistake in his speech of Tuesday He
seemed to suppose that the Virginia and Ken-
tuckv resolutions were mainly directed against
the increase of executive patronage. Sir, they
were mainly intended to check the assumption of
legislative power, in derogation of the lights of
the States, by the Congress of the United States
The meiease of executive patronage was con
demned as the incv table result of that unconsti-
tutional legislation The honorable Senator, I
feai, is a woise interpreter of the Vnginia and
Kentucky resolutions than my friend from New
Jeisey, with all the imputed infusion of ancient
Fedeiahsm into his Democracy He is now
fighting the battles of republican liberty The
Senatoi has gone over to Philip and his Mace-
donian phalanx
Mi   President, I protest against the effort of
the Senator to identify the cause of banks and
bank monopolies with the State governments   It
is true, that the States have been by degrees en
trapped into excesses upon this subject    They
have been caught in the toils of associated wealth
But many of them have seen then erroi, and are
retiacing their steps    The free banking system,
eithei by its success ot  its failuie, will, I hope,
extricate State legislation fiom the pernicious in   I
fluence which has been too long cícieised ovti
it by the banking powi r                                            I
Hut the Senatoi asks, do not the State laws
prohibit State officers fiom holding Fedeial ap
pomlments > Does not the Fedeial Constitution
prohibit certain ofheois from being elected to scats
in this or the other branch of Congicss' And aie
not these disqualifications' Sir, 1 am suipnsed
that an argument so inapplicable to the enact-
ments of this bill should have been advanced by
any Senatoi on this ilooi The Tederal Consti-
tution, the State laws, do piohibit, as they ought
to prohibit, the same individual fiom holding in-
compatible offices They do not punish him for
speaking or acting at elections
The honorable Senator fiom Vngimi charges
a high oflicei of the Government with the avowal I
of the principle that, in making appointments, he
selects his political fnends alone     No Adminis-
tration could be successfully conducted without a
gcneial adherence to this pnnciple     He accuses
nnothei high ofKcei of interfering in an election in
South Cniulina     Sn, what aie the ficts'   lam
nifoimed that the fnends of a candidate for Con   I
giess in that State [Mt  Lloare] attempted to in
fluence votes in his favor by representing the Sec-
íetary of Wai to be his friend     A gentleman
addiessed a lettei to the Secretary on the subject,
and inquiied whether the candidate in question
Was a supporter of the Administration ? The an
swer was, that Mr Poinsett did not íegard him
as such    Now, sir, while the name of the Secre-
taiy could be clandestinely used on  the side of
the Conseinative candidate, it was all right and
proper, but the moment that the Secietary of War
was forced into   the deckration that he did not
regard the gentleman as a fuend of the Admims-
tiation, then the honoiable Senator sees in the
conduit of that high officer an inteiference in  <
elections dangeious to public liberty'                       I
The honorable Senator fiom Virginia has re-
nounced the principles of Democracy He said,
in his speech last evening, th it he was not a Dem
oeratic Rejiubhcan, that he did not belong to the
Democracy of the country Sir, I thank him foi
making the avowal He has thrown off the mask,
he is not of the people, he is sgiinst being gov- 11
erned by the people "We shall now understand
him, he has changed sides, he has aopropi lately
placed himself in the society of those gentlemen
so far advanced in life that they disclaim the knav-
ery of Demociacy The Senatoi declaies that Dem
Oeratic Republicanism does not belong to the soil
of Virginia Sir, I think I have a light to pro-
nounce the a'legation a libel upon hei character
Democratic principles, the binding authonty of
the people, the doctrine of the equal and inalien-
able rights of the people, subsist nowhere in
greater force than in Virginia Sir, the Senator
has retrograded behind the spirit and principles
of the age Democracy, radical Democracy, as
near an approach as possible to the enforcement
of the popular will, is the spieadmg light of the
times It is a principle dear to every true Repub-
lican                                                              .
Sir, permit me, in the language of a late elo-
quent wntei, to say to the Senator that this prin-
ciple " lies at the foundation of all our institu-
tions " The party must become truly Democratic
"It must go for the whole people, against all
monopolies , against all exclusive privileges ,
against all aristocratic measures, m favoi of mild
and equal laws, in favor of equal rights, of edu-
cation, literature, aits, and philosophy It must
plant itself upon the essential equality of man,
upon the fact that theie is something divine in
every man It must be evei on the side of fiee
dom, sympathize with the oppiessed, with all
who are struggling for then rights It must be
high toned and moral, confiding in the people,
and still more in the immortal vigoi of truth and
justice " Sn, the man who renounces these prm
ciples may well decluie that he doc s not belong to
the Democracy of the counti y " Paities, me íely
as parties,"says the same piofound wntei, " aic
nothing to the masses Individuals, as mdivid
uals, aie nothing to them A Chy, a Webster,
a Van Buren, a Calhoun, aie nothing to the in,
any furthc r than they are impersonations of great
principles Show them th it this oi th it m m
embodies in himself the cause of millions tint
in íaising him to office the cmse of the nnlli m is
secured, and then, as the lcpicse ntatnc ot lint
ciuse, does he become of impoitmc ' And I t
me add, sir, in the piophitic spnit of the same
authoi, that if the jireseut Chief M igisti  te ' fail
in his Administration, it wi I be bectu e he may
fail to identify himse If with the ¡aopular cms
Let him be really and tiuly the re piescntati e of
that caube, and no powei on eaith can pieve it
his reelection " The piity, sn, can span, tic
man who disavows the jinnciplcs of Democi icy,
as here delineated
The honorable Senator has fiequently expressed
his admuation of Edmund Buike   He is notonly
his admuei, but hi¡> mutatoi     He pioudly dis
dams to answer eeitain  Scnatois on this flue i
Who gave him a right to pi ice himself above any
gentlemen sent heie by a sovereign State'   ¡such
an assumption of disdain of his equals, on an oc
casion of dosetting his filends, and  disavowing
what they supposed to be Ins Demociaticprinci
ples,illustiates the temper and political churactei
of the Senatoi, who has closely followed his gieat
model in these lespeets    Upon Buike's defection
fiom the English Whigs, Cooke leinaiks that,
" Although a Y\ tug from politic ll connection, from a con
cuirence ot views upon certain grnt que stions, and noma
di approvil of the> I orín*., he wj^, nevertheless, never in
his heart a friend to popular Government \\ ith ihc most
extended views of philanthropy, he hated the peopit His
philosophic mind shieink from a contact with the vulgai
To him nothing wa*> s > disgusting He would labor tor the
advtntage of the croud, but he mt^t b* lüovved ticlts
pense his blessings fiom above ^o genuine in aristocrat
in heart wa will! great dithcu ty kept iviibm the pale of
Democracy "
Gentlemen may run out the parallel
The honorable Senntoi posses tglov me eulogy
upon Fngland and English institutions, and de-
clares that we have derived fiom that glomus
I countiy,and her magna chai ta and bills of lights,
I all that is valuable m our institutions    Sir, when
I heard this extravagant encomium pionounced
upon the British institutions and the Bntish Gov
einment, I was piepaied to expect any ehdiige on
his pait     I could not be snrpused at his renun
nation last night of the principles of Democi acy
That I may not be accused ot misapprehending
i the Senator on  this subject, I beg leave to lead
