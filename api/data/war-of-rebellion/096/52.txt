FORT MONROE, VA., January 6, 1865-6.30 p.m.

(Received 10.30 p.m.)

Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War:

We arrived here safely this afternoon, and will remain until to-morrow forenoon. I forgot to mention to you that I shall continue, acting as Secretary, issuing orders and making regulations. Your official style and signature will be that of your commission, Assistant Secretary, and not Acting Secretary. I noticed,in my former absence that the latter style had been adopted, but there can be only one Acting Secretary, and as I shall act, the style of Acting Secretary, proper in some cases, is not in the present case.

Lieutenant-General.
