Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Southard.
Senate.
the merciless savage is upon u-- come speedily to
our help"' how can we refuse them' 5 weuld not
avoid it? I would not seek to avoid it I admit,
m its fullest latitude, the obligation of the Govern
ment to extend protection over all its citiz°ns> I
■would have the name of an American citiz°n an
impenetrable shield overe/ery man who bears it,
as in old Rome, at the cry "I am a Roman citi-
z*n," the uplifted arm of tyranny and oppression
was paralyzed and fell powerless at the sound. I
would have it so here. At the cry "I am an
American cit'zen," I would be ever ready to put
forth all the energy of this Government for his
protection and defence. But, wmle I admit this,
I insist that, when we are laj mg our plans for the
future, and can plainly see that a certain arrange
ment will tempt the States into a situation which
is likely to bring us all into trouble, i' is an argu-
ment why we should refrain from making the ar-
rangement Selt'ers have no right, m bodies of
fifty or sixty thousand, togo upon the public lan^s
and bring upon the whole nation all the cilamities
and expense of an Indian war Look at the con
sequences of this amendment The nine new
States take all the land within their limits Pio-
sently the Territory of Wiskonsan comes and
knocks at your door We shall h ar and admit
her into the Confederacy. According to seme
gentleman, we must do so, because we have no
power—no constitutional power—to refu-e Wei!,
Wiskonsan is admitted, he"1 territory contain* mil
lions of acres, and she then turns around and de
mands that J ou shall cele all these lands to her,
as you have ceded to Arkansas and Missouri
Can you deny her' You canno* The moment
she comes into the Union, ¡f this bi'l passes, all the
land within her limits is hers, and must be hers,
and will be hers, if you now consent to the cession
which is proposed What next1 Presently Iowa
comes and knocks, and she demanda the same pri-
vilege as Wiskonsan She tells you 'hat her peo
pie have gone there on the public land, tha' they
have increased and mu'tiplied until lheyhaie at-
tained the constitutional numbers,.and now they
have a right to be a Stat  and 'o enjoy equal pie
rogatives with all the other States "True," say
they, "there are Indian li'les in the way, and there
may be Indian >vars, but give us all the land, and
then put your hand into the Tieas ry ot all th  old
States, and foot up and pa/ the bill of all the
expense "
Your eight hundred millions of aTes pre daily
being swallowed up by the piogress oí population
Territory after Territory will °pp!y, and the mo
ment you admit tnem you have surrend&ei pvry
foot of the pjbbc and fthich the/ contain You
are virtually surrendering it now, fd how can I
stand here, after hiving given the land to Arkan-
sas, andrefuí>e it to Wiskonsan and to losa, and to
every Tenaoi/wmch may be formrd to the Roe¿y
Mountains and the m u h of the Colu nbia river'
Thus you are to have the burden of th<- sen ement
of all these Territories, of the extinction of all the
Indian titles, and the expens  of all the Tn-
dian wars, and then to -urrender to hem ev^ry
acre of that mheritanc  which the old States
purchased with blood, when the claimants weie
unknown, when they wjc jet in the Joins of their
fathers.
There are vanons odier objcCions which lie as
well against the general character of tms intend-
ment as against its dstails, a"d wh ch, to me, ^p
pear to be insuperable I had ir>'ended to suggest
a number of them, but I fear it will be unwise
to attempt this fur her th?n toeilt a ' ntiou to
one or two On the question of price I have al-
ready commented, jn showing ho " the States will
be situated as to the profit they are to der.ve from
the proposed arrangement There •> anotoer fea-
ture m ihe plan to when I have airea !y a'loded
under othei aspects of the general subject This
compact, it i, provided, i* to be iirevocbl  The
States are to declare it p rpetu 1, mviolabl" now
and forever, and the Generil Government is to be
equally bound Now, are we grown so wis-, in
Qur day and generation, as to be prepared to bind
both the General and State Governments, m a
manner irrevocable, for all future time, no matter
what unknown events may arise hereafter Gen-
tlemen, to be sure, may flatter themselves that their
intelligence can stretch it, piercing ken through all
time to come, and anticipate and provide for every
po^ibie posture oí iffain Our fathers, howevei,
had not equal intelligent Gj back but a quarter
ofaenmry, and where do you find a single man
who ever looked at in  condition of thing, that
now exss? Yet the), I am inclined'o supple,
were as v is- as we I ask those who aie so vet¡
rf aJy to nt-r into mutual ob' sat ons, which are to
be irrevocAb'e through all future time, whemer m
peace or in war, whether in prosperity or tie
deepest distress, if they believe that they are so
wise as to be able to foresee all that will happen,
and how such ¿n arrangement will jei'amly be^r
upon even s no' ye present' If they toll m  hey
are, ihen I bow to them as prophets indued from
above with knowledge and fores ght such as does not
fall to the ordinary lot of human ty For my
humble self, who claim no such high prerogative, t
must object to that feature of perpetuity We are
binding ourselves, blindfolded, without knowing
what circumstance^ will arise or what w,l] be the
future conduct of these States in re'ation to the
contract their representa'ives a'P no  so ready to
make. Nor can we anticipate wha* may be our
own necessities I obiect to entering into an irre-
vocable bond of this description L"t us pass sue
laws in relation to this public land that we may
reaca it when justice, policy, necessity may de-
mand Let us plac  ihe subject so that we, or
(nose who follow u", can lay our hands upon it—
so that we and they may 1-ok round, may see
what our condition is—may measure all our du
ties and obligations, and then decide according to
the existing stat  of things at the moment of our or
their action
I object, again, to the want of powc in this Q0
vernmentto enforcMhe provisons of its own bar
gain, f tl is is to b  the bargain Look at tne fifth
clause of this amendment, and  e how yoj are to
enforce i On th p inc pi   of this Union and
nndei ne power^ granted jon by the Constituí on,
jou cannot do it
And here I may notice another item, t! ot' <i it
is a small one, in the details of the seneme I refer
to the cession here proposed to the State oí Ternes
see I do rot know enough of the circu nstiti e«s
oft'ie ca*e to jjdg  for what reason this direct
lint iv.  o be maje to that one State. She is
ot here placed upon the «ame ground 'will
tber Stat--., but stands is an excepti n a*no g them
Tnere m?> be good leisors for this, bat I am. for
the present, incoa pe en' to conceive o i what j jst
gtound a piovisirn like this can iect
But my ch ef clj ction *o this amendment 1 e^
atth" foundation of i Ii has regard loth? basi* o i
which tri" whole res o I oppose it as a cesm
ot th  property of i his na'ion What is that pro-
perty' It is an inheritance ir land, wider in is
(.x'ent than the widest limit of ih  Roman Ernntre,

those who repre tnled tne Amcncin Co'oni s p o-
ciaimed them to be independent of t!'e B ui h
Ciown, they looked, one and all, to l le Crown
Unds as b mg sufficient L/entually to le'ieve them
under the burden ol ihe stiugg'e T«ese lards
were to pay th  Revolutionary debt, -o that tne
Colone-n ight come outofth" great'"mtest free

si enasto be he FlandeiS, th  battle gro md of
the Revolution, that h r property must be wrecked
in the storm, and though -he mighr com  en'
v.ctoiious, and even rich in glorv, she mu.t be
hopelessly poor m oiher respects. She therefore
made her appeal to her sister colonies, demanding
that, while others became possessed of immense
wealth in these lands, and while he' blood mingled
wnh theirs, and was poured out in streams on
manv a battle field fought in the common cause,
she snould not be left alone in poverty and distress,
while they were proud and powerful Her ap-
peal was iist«n d to, and one of the grounds of
the cession of these lands to the Unifd States
was thatveiy appea1 As one of her representa-
tives on th s floor, I have not forgotten enough
of all I have heard from my elders of the suffer-
ings she endured in those days, lo be willing here
to surrender what, m the crisis of her trial, she
demanded as her due, and what wa? freely yielded
to the justice of ber demanj The whole of these
lands were rdieved by the Revolution from the
claims o the British Crown, and they became the
common property of this nation by what has
here been called the "generous" surrender of Vir-
ginia and other States I would rather call it their
just surrender to the equal rights of an equal
suffering and an equal triumph I think I do
more honor to Vi'gima and those other States in
saying that they believed it to be just, than in
putting the act on any other ground—of magnan -
muy, liberality, or self denial. A generous act it
was, but its ja tice was its highest eneomiutn.
The land came into our possession as a common
funa, foi the common use and benefit, and I stop
not to inquire whether the transaction was finan-
cial or otherwise Discuss that point as you
may, it will come to this at last, that whether the
cetston was made on grounds of finance alone, or
wnh a view to what the history of our war re-
quired and justice dema-ded, and to sustain our
Republican Government, our civil liberties, and
thereby to preserve toe hope of human liberty, it
will be found of little consequenc I care not.
In every aspect, the^e lands became the common
prop rty of ihe Union for the common use and
benefit o' ah the S'ates. It haa always been so
managed, and 6o regarded Da-ing the early
history of ih^ Government, it was never looked at
in any other I ght Search our history from be-
& nning to eid, and you will fina that all this
dfctnne ahoii sUrr-nd rmg it to a few of the
S ates is a no1 on of verv modem growth It is not
a quaiter ofa century old, and I think we are be-
coming wise a little too fast, and that we are taught
tnese lessens of wisdom by Slates fh*>n unknown
and unborn Tne m n who compose them were
infants in tneir mothers' arms, <¡t brothers a, d sons
of the^e wnom they wou1 J now deprive of their in-
heritance The oldest of them had not learned to
lead from thn Virginia grant was made, who now
stand heie to teach us that the public domain is no
ljnger to h  r gorged as cenmon prcpetty, held
¡or the icn ion u*e I prefer to take lesson', en
sich ? subject, from these who «ere themselves in
the strugj e which purchased them, and formed
tie compact, of thr   who knew their rights, and
wee wi'ling lo de^l eqi all; and jnsily Tney
kn w ihe "-rounds on nici they pr iceeded, they
prepai d and f xhibited to the world the punciples
they he'd, and I am me ned to helieve that they
were at least as pw otic in tn  r views and opi
mons as di">se uno sur 1 in a position where local
intere ts and S ale pr de have iheirfuH operation
on t econc u ions of th' mtid
But tne idea that we are, tith r by (his cession
or by pre emption law , to take away the mherf
tance oi the old States, has coupled with it another
object onabie featare Tne land belongs to all the
Sta'fs in fee simple Bat suppose it did not, and
that d had been pji-chss-d for (he benefit of tho=e
who setile on it without pretence of law, I ask,
how has it been pa d fo.l You will find, when
you look in*o the actual state of facts on that sub
jec , (t do n^r fer to the In ban way of estima-
ting tne hL of the lnni,)— yoj will find tha-
reckon po- ti  money pail for Louisiana air",
Flouda, together with toe exp nditures under the
e\isiu & la id system, 150 millions of dollars haya
b en paid out oi tht Treasury, while but 108 ml
¡ions have as yet returned in o it. The lands are
debtor to the United States—to the old States—'o
the amount of forty ¡Billions of dodars And yet
we mist now surrender the whole, we mu t forget
the blood «Inch his been shed, snd all the suffer-
ings which were endured, to earn this land, and
give it away to all who choose to coma and claim
it.   Is this just*   is n light?   Take as an example
