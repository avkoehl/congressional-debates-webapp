JOHN W. GARRETT, Esq.:

Your telegram received. Please use every exertion to get immediately information as to the position of troops on your road at all points between Baltimore and Parkersburg and Wheeling, and communicate to me especially where Crook is.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, July 14, 1864.

Colonel HARDIE:

I respectfully recommend that the clerks and employes in each Executive Department be organized under their own officers, and be ordered out only by their own chiefs, and when so ordered out for the defense of the city they report for assignment to duty to General Augur. The organization should be kept up, and the arms and munitions of war receipted for and kept on hand. Would it not be well to send out a circular request from the War Department to the above effect?
