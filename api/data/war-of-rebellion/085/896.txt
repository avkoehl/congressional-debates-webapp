HEADQUARTERS,In the Field, Hickman Mills, October 15, 1864-6 a. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

Major Smith, Second Colorado, returned last night from scout east of Independence. Learned from citizens that a force of 200 had crossed the river, going north, on the 13th, and 100 on yesterday (crossed west of Lexington), and that Price, with a force of 8,000, had gone south. This information is from citizens of Missouri and must be taken for what it is worth. Captain Allen, of the Seventy-seventh Enrolled Missouri Militia, reports yesterday from Pleasant Hill that he was holding that place with 150 men, and that bushwhackers were quite numerous around him. I send Major Anderson with a battalion of Eleventh Kansas this morning, with instructions to make a reconnaissance east until he learns something reliable relative to the locality and movements of the enemy. Colonel Jennison arrived last night with 250 of Fifteen Kansas and 700 mounted militia and one mountain howitzer. Colonel Blair reports his arrival at Paola last night with 900 mounted men and six pieces of artillery; will be here to-day. Upon the arrival of Colonel Blair I will have 4,200 men (including Colonel Ford's command) and seventeen pieces of artillery. Arms and ammunition have arrived and are being distributed. I will soon have everything in fighting trim. The men are all eager for a fight. I will keep you promptly [informed] of everything I learn.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. BLUNT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,In the Field, Hickman Mills, October 15, 1864- 12 m.

Major-General CURTIS:

In view of the possibility of Price moving south I would suggest that you telegraph directing the militia now at Paola, Mound City, and Fort Scott and concentrating at those points to remain there until further orders, that they may be in easy supporting distance of Fort Scott in case that post is threatened. Major Anderson, of the Eleventh Kansas, with three left this morning at sunrise. I directed him to move rapidly, and continue in an easterly direction until he obtained reliable information of the enemy or met the advance of General Rosecrans' force. I think the reconnaissance of Major Anderson on the Sedalia road and Colonel Ford on the Lexington road must certainly soon develop the position and movements of Price. A scout was sent day before yesterday from Coldwater Grove with instructions to go east to intersect the road leading from Boonville south. They have not yet returned. When they do I will report to you the result of their scout. If I obtain reliable information that Price has moved south in force shall I move down on his flank for the protection of Fort Scott and the border south, without waiting for orders from you? Forage here is quite abundant and easily obtained. Stock in good condition. Arms and ammunition being distributed. Will have my whole command organized and in good fighting condition by night. I am just starting train to Kansas City for subsistence.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. BLUNT,

Major-General.
