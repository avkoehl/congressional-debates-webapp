ery we immediately received orders to prepare to march. We resumed the march at 12 m.; marched a little west of south to the bridge on the Oostenaula River, which steam we crossed at 7 p.m. Bivouacked one mile south of the river. On the 17th we resumed the march at an early hour. Had some light skirmishing with the rebel cavalry on the evening of the 17th. On the 18th we marched through Adairsville, thence to the plantation of a British subject, where General Wilder had engaged the enemy's cavalry and repulsed them. Here we bivouacked for the night in an open field, and three companies of the Forty-eighth Illinois Infantry were thrown out in front of the division as skirmishers. On the morning of the 19th we resumed the march at an early hour. Marched by a circuitous route to Kingston, Ga., when we went into camp and remained until the 23d. On the 23rd crossed Hightower [Etowah] River. On the 23d, 24, 25th, and 26th marched uninterruptedly until the evening of the 26th. At 7 p. m. the Forty-eighth Illinois Infantry was deployed as skirmishers (in the vicinity of Dallas) for the division. Immediately after the several companies of the Forty-eighth were deployed, sharp skirmishing ensued; the skirmishers of the Forty-eighth driving the rebel skirmishers on our right to within 150 yards of his strong works. On the 27th we were relieved from the skirmish line and ordered to the brigade. Immediately after receiving the order we resumed our position on the line and constructed works; but before we had completed our rifle-pits the enemy charged us in heavy columns, but were handsomely repulsed, with heavy loss. We remained in our works and on the skirmish line until the morning of the 1st of June. From the evening of the 26th to the morning of the 1st of June the Forty-eighth Illinois Infantry lost, in killed and wounded, 55 men.

On the 1st of June we moved to New Hope Church, eight miles northeast from Dallas, where we were ordered to take our position behind the front line of works. Here we remained until the morning of the 6th, when we were ordered to march in pursuit of the retreating enemy. We marched to Acworth, halted, and rested until the morning of the 10th. On the 10th we marched to Big Shanty, and took our position on the line in front of the enemy's works. Here we remained until 12 m. on the 15th of June. We were then ordered to the left one mile and a half, for the purpose of driving the enemy from a prominent hill upon which the general wished to construct a fort. After driving the enemy from the hill, the Forty-eighth Regiment, with the several other regiments of the brigade, moved back three-quarters of a mile, perfectly exhausted from fatigue, thirst, heat, and hunger. We encamped in an open field, where we remained until the morning of the 19th, when we were ordered to the right one mile for the purpose of occupying a line of works which had been constructed by General M. L. Smith, in supporting distance of the Second Division. Here we remained until the evening of the 25th, when we were ordered to the front line of works, two miles to the right. Here we remained until 3 a. m., 26th, at which time we were ordered to relieve the Sixth Iowa. We remained in the works of the Sixth Iowa and on the skirmish line until the morning of the 3rd of July, when we discovered that the enemy had evacuated the mountain in our front.
