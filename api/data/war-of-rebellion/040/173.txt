able to take care of it without materially weakening your posts up the river. I shall urge General Burnside to put a strong force in the Sandy Valley at once.

General A. E. BURNSIDE:

The rebels on Lower Kanawha are below all our troops, except one company at Point Pleasant. If any of your troops are passing, it would be highly desirable for a regiment or two to stop at Point Pleasant till the whole magnitude of the raid is known, and communication with General Scammon at Charleston reopened. I will send you further news as fast as I get it.

I have been informed that about 700 of your men were expected at Parkersburg this morning; if so, the loan of them for a few days might put everything right.

(Received March 30-12.50 p. m.)

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Dispatch from Gallipolis, just received, says the rebels have taken Point Pleasant, at mouth of Kanawha. Only one company of troops is at Gallipolis, and the river is, therefore, the chief protection to the Ohio shore. All Sorts of rumors as to their force, up to thousands, but nothing reliable.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHESEBROUGH, Baltimore:

Dispatch from Gallipolis, just received, says the rebels have taken Point Pleasant. All sorts of exaggerated rumors as to numbers. There are no troops along the Ohio line, and the river is probably sufficient protection, but, if the force is large, I fear they may move northward toward the railroad. I have informed General Burnside also of the condition of things.

General KELLEY, Cumberland:

Dispatch, just received, says the rebels have taken Point Pleasant. This would look as if their force was larger than first reported, and their being on the north bank of that river will make it necessary to look out for them farther north.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
