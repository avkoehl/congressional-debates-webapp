ment He has called, but will they obey his man-
date? May we not hope that there are a sufficient
number of honest, independent banks who will dis-
avow his authonty, and refuse to unite with hunin
this crusade against the rights of the people, undei-
laken without cause, and carried on against all
law and bound morality Yes, sir, "he may call
spirits from the vas>ty deep, but will they come?" I
hope and think not
It is a little remarkable thai, in all which has
been written by the president of this institution, not
one word is said to excuse or palliate his own te-
iusal, or the refusal of those he is attempting to in-
fluence, to comply with their engagements He
has the money to paj, and will not do it The law
commands him to pay—morality requires u, still a
law superior to both, in his estimation, forbids
That supenoi law is Im own will, which, for his
own purposes, he has substituted for that code of
laws and morals which most men feel constrained
to regal d
In the piesent discussion, I must take it for
granted that this bank is able to pay its debts, and
meet all its liabihties I am obliged to do this, be-
ciuse the president of the institution says the fact
is so, a-yá he has n< t furnished, in his lettT, the
means ot enabling me to lorm an opinion for my-
self. When he stated that he had four millions ot
specie in his-vaults, had he stated his available
means, had he also staled what amount of
of notes, payable on demand, old and new, were
m cnculation, whit the deposites m the bank were,
what were the balances m favor of other banks,
which lumor places at a veiy high amount, ami
lus other items of indebtedness, then something
like a correct opinion might be formed as to his
ability to resume and continue specie pa}ments
When ht stated that he had eight or ten millions
of specie in England, had he stated what demands
there were upon him in that country, thei the pub-
lic could have seen whether any aid could have
been expected from thai source to sustain the bank
in Philadelphia, in case of emeigency
Let it be remembered that this is only a State
institution, which is putting up these arrogant pte-
tensions If countenance be shown to this assump-
tion, what security have we that the sa ne may not
be attempted by all and ei eiy one of the ei¿ht bun-
dled hanks scatteicd throughout the countl}?
Yom pettj tyrants and dictators will spring up in
ever; village where a bank is located, and these
who are entitled to but common respect and esti-
mation, so soon as the> acquire any authority or
control in one of these institutions, will attempt to
teach their honest neighbor , who may be indebted
in bank, that they must think with, vote with, and
act with them in all things, under the penally oí
having every cent they owe exacted Irom tlitm,
even to the impoverishment of the ir wives and
children
On one account I am pleased with the appear-
ance of this letter of the president of the B mk ot
Pennsylvania, it is a plain, fiank declaration en
the part of the bank, ol a determination to use its
power to opeiate upon the politics ot the country,
and the measures of the Government This is the
warfaie which is tobe carried on Form} self I
am ready to engage in it, and although it is decreed
that 1 am to leave this august body, and my voice
is no longer to be heard in the Senate chamber,
still I will not be silent Although afar off and m
private life, my voice shall be heard, advising, ur-

RESURRECTION NOTES.
SPEECH OF MR. BUCHANAN,
Op Pennsylvania,
In Senate, Monday, Jiprll 23,1838—On the engrossed
bill to prohibit the issue and circulation of the
notes of the late 13 mk of the United States.
Mr BUCHANAN said theie was but one con-
sideration which could induce him, at the piesent
moment, to take any part m the discussion of the
bill now before the Senate. He felt it to be his
duty to defend the Legislative of the State which
he had, m pan, the honor to represent, Irom the
charge which had been made agamst them by the
Senatot from New Jersey [Ml Wall] and othei
Senators, and by many of the public presses
throughout the country, that, in «chartering the
Bank of the United States, they had conferred
upon it the powers of a great trading company
This charge «as wholly unfounded in point oí
fact. The charter had not constituted it a trading
company, and he felt himseli bound to make the
most solemn and public denial of ihat charge If
this Bank had become the great cotton merehant
which was represented, and he ¿id not doubt the
fact, it had acted m express \ íolation of its charter
lie therefore rose, not to criminate, but to defend
the Legislature of his native State
The Democratic party of Pennsylvania had been,
unlortu lately, divided in 18.J5, and the conse-
quence was the recharter of the Bank ol the United
States. Of the wisdom or policy of this measure
(said Mr B ) the Senate ol the United States are
not constituted the judges I shall never discuss
that question here This is not the proper forum
I shall leave it to the sovereign people of the State
To them, and to them alone, are their representa-
tives directly responsible lor this rechaiter ol the
Bank As a cit /en of the State, I have, on all
suitable occasions, both m public and m private,
expressed my opinion boldly and fiecty upon the
subject In a letter irom this uty, dated on the
30th June, 1830, whuh wis published throughout
the State, I have piesinted m) views, m detail upon
this question , and I it el no disposition to retract
or recant a single sentiment «Inch 1 tl en ex-
pressed On the contnrj, expeliente has only
spued to confirm my first convictions
Mv task is now much more agreeable It is that
of defending the very Legislature who renewed the
charter of the Bank, from the charge which has
been made and reiterated over and over again, here
and throughout the country, ol having created a
vast corporation, with power to deal in cotton, or
any other amele of merchandise A mere reference
to the charter, will, ot itself, establish my position
It leaies no room ior aigument or doubt The
rule of common rtason, as well as of common law,
is, that a corporation can exercise no power, except
what has been expressly granted by its charier The
exercise of any other power, is a mere naked usur-
pation On the prestnt occasion, however, I need
not icsort to this rule The charter not only con-
fers no such power ot Hading, but it contains an
express prohibition against it It was approved by
the Governor on the 18th daj of Fcbiuarj, 1836,
and the fifth fundamental article contains the fol-
lowing provision "The said empmatwn shall not,
directly ormdirtclly, deal or bade m any thing except
bills of exchange, gold and silver bullion, or m the sale
of goods really and truly pledged for money lent andnot
redeemed m due time or goods which shall be the pro-
ceeds oj its lands " In this particular, it is but a
mere transcript from the charter granted to the late
Bank by Congress on the 10th of \pnl,181G, win h
was itself copied from the charter ot the first Bank
of the United States, established m the year 1791
I have not recently had an opportunity of examin-
ing the ch&Uer of the Bank of England, but 1 be-
lieve it conams a similai provision The Senate
will, therefore, at once perceive that there is as lit-
tle foundation for charging the Legislature of Penn-
sylvania w i'h conferring upon the existing bank the
enormous poweiS of a great trading company, as
there wouid ha\e been for making a similar charge
aganst the first or the last Con¿itss which charter-
ed a Bank of the United States It is true that the
Bank, under its existing charter, can deal much
[ more extensively xn stocks than it could have done

formerly, but this power floes not touch the piesent
question
The Bank, by becoming a merchant and dealing
in cotton, has clearly violated its charter, and that,
too, m a most essential particular Either the Le-
gislature or the Governor may direct a scire facia 
to issue agamst it for this cause; and, if thes fact be
found by a jury, the Supreme Court of the State
can exercise no discretion on lire subject, but must,
under the express terms of the act creating it, ad-
judge its charter to be forfeited and annulled
Whether the Legislatura or the Governor shall pur-
sue this course, is for them, not for me, to decide
This Bank has already so completely entwined
itself around our system o£ internal improvements
and common school education, that it doubtless be-
lieves it may violate its charter with impunity. Be
this as it may, tbe sm of speculating in cotton lies
at the door of the Bank, and not at that of the
Legislature.
Heaven knows the Legislature have been suffi-
ciently liberal in conferring powers upon this in-
stitution, but I doubt whether a single member of
that body would have voted to cieate a trading
company, with a capital of $35,000,000, in union
with banking privileges Let us pause and reflect
ior a moment upon the nature and consequences
of these combined powers A bank of discount
and circulation, with such an enoimous capital,
and a trading company united' By expanding oí
contracting its discounts and cnculation, asa bank,
it can render money plenty or money scarce, at
its pleasure It can thus raise or depress the puce
of cotton, or any other article, and make the mar-
ket to suit its speculating purposes The more
derangement that exists m the domestic exchanges
of the country, the larger will be its profits. The
period of a suspension cl specie payments is its
best harvest, during which it can amass millions
It is clearly the interest of this Bank, whatever
may be its inclination, that specie payments should
continue suspended, and the domestic exchanges
should continue deranged as long as possible. The
ruin of the country thus becomes its most abun-
dant source of profit Accordingly, what do we
find to have been its course ot policy'2 I have
heard it described by several gentlemen from the
South and Southwest, some of whom are members
of this body It has gone into that region of the Union
with these resurrection note's of the old Bank, the
reissue of which this bill proposes to prohibit, and,
in some States, it has exchanged them, the one-
half for the depreciated local currency, and the
other half for specie With this local currency
it has purchased cotton, and sent it to England for
the purpose ot paying its debts there, whilst with
the specie it has replenished its vaults at home In
other State  it has exchanged these dead notes of
the old Bank for the notes of the local banks, re-
ceiving a large premium on the transaction, and
with the latter has purchased cotton on specula-
tion A general resumption of specie payments
would at once put an end to this profitable traffic
It has, then, first violatad the charter from Con-
gress by reissuing the notes of the old Bank, and
then violated the charter from Pennsylvania by
speculating in cotton During the suspension of
specie payments, these notes have been the only
universal paper circulation throughout the country,
and thus, by reissuing them, in defiance of the law,
the present Bank has been enabled to accumulate
extravagant profits
This charge against the Bank of speculating in
cotton has nei er, to my knowledge, been contra-
dicted We have heard it from the other side of
the Atlantic, as well as from the South and the
Southwest The Whig pi ess of our country has
commended, nay, almost gloufied the Bank for go-
ing into the cotton market, when that article was
depressed, and making large purchases, and its
fuends in England have echoed these no,es ot
praise Its example has produced a new era in
banking We find that the Southern ana South-
western banks have al o lipome centón merchants,
and, from present appearances, the trade in this
great staple ot our country is no longer to be
conducted by private merchants, but by banking
corporations
Under this system, what will be the f|te oí yottv
