Nearly all the above was shipped at Marseilles, the great

Africa, Spain, Italy, &c., and with small exceptions were
invoiced at six or eight cents per pound, a few lots of su-
perior washed wool being invoiced at lourtecn and filteen
cent^ per pound; while tao coarse article, as clipped from
the backs of the sheep in Western Viigima, Ohio, Penn-
sylvania, New VToik, and the New England States, sells

Gross Imports and Exports.

Com. and Nav. page 305, Imports, including
duty and free goods, every item enteiod in
the United States custom-houses  282.613.150
By United States official reports, the exports
exceed the impoits $94,664,418
To the above may be added in the different
States, railways, canals, chartered compa-
nies, stocks, &e., &c , ceitamly to the extent
of  30,000,000
It would thus show a balance in favor of the
United States of $124,664,418
If such -be correct, as shown by the statistics of
this country, how is it, that exchange is always
against the United States? and why such largo
shipments of specie? Is it not caused by under-
valuation of imports under the ad valorem system ?
Is it not smuggled?
Mr. JONES addressed the committee for an
hour upon the political questions of the day. [His
remarks will be published in the Appendix.]
Mr. BINGHAN obtained the floor, but yielded
to
Mr. ELY, who moved that the committee do
now rise.
Mr. TOMPKINS. If my colleagite [Mr. Bing-
ham] does not choose to speak this evening, and
will yield me the floor, I will occupy some time.
Mr. BINGHAM. I have no objection.
Mr. THOMAS. Ivibjeot.
Mr. ELY. Then I insist on my motion.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and Mr. Dawes
having taken the chair as Speaker pro tempore,
Mr Wa<5hburnt, ofMnino, reported that the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
had had under consideration the Union generally,
and particularly House bill No. 338, to provide
for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes, to
authorize a loan, to regulate and fix the duties on
imports, and for other purposes; and had comc to
no conclusion thereon.
And then, on motion of Mr. THOMAS, (at
a quarter past four o'clock, p. m.,) the House
adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Tuesday, April 54, I860.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m. Prayer
by Rev. Mason" Noblj;.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. 1 move that
the rules be suspended, and that the House re-
solve itself into the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union.
Air. HOJLMAN. Before that motion be put, I
desire to have on order made to print the bill for
the relief of the widows and children of certain
officers and soldiers of the war of 1812.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I object to any bill for
the relief of anybody. The bill makes an appro-
priation.
The SPEAKER. The request is only to have
the bill printed.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I think it better that we
should go dircctly into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union. I do not know
anything about the gentleman's bill; and we differ
so widely in our opinions about what is right and
proper to be done, that I think it improper, with
not seventy members present, to do anything but
go into the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understood that
the motion to print was acquiesced in.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I could not object till I
heard what the bill was.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Indiana
merely asks to have the hill printed.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I see no necessity for its
being printed till it is properly reported to the
House.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from
Georgia object ?
Mr. CRAWFORD. I very distinctly do ob-
ject.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. Then, I renew
my motion.
DEATHS ON TIIE AFRICAN STATION.
The SPEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication from the President of the United States,
transmitting a report from the Secretary of the
Navy, to whom had been referred the resolution
of the House of Representatives of April 10,1860,
requesting information as to the number of officers
and men m the service of the United States, be-
longing to the African squadron, who have died
in that service from the date of the Ashburton
treaty up to the present time; which was laid on
the table, and ordered to be printed.
TERRITORY 0£ MINNESOTA.
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
message from the President of the United States,
in answer to a resol ution oft he House o f Represent-
atives, requesting him to communicate all the in-
formation he might possess in relation to the ex-
istence of the Territory of Minnesota, stating that
he possesses no information on the subject, ex-
cept what has been derived from the acts of Con-
gress and from the proceedings of the House
itself; that since the date of the act of May 11,
1853, admitting a portion of the Territory of Min-
nesota as a State into the Union, no act had been
performed by the President either affirming or
denying the existence of such a Territory; and
that the question in regard to that portion of the
Territory without the'hmits of the existing State
remains for the decision of Congress, and is in the
same condition it was in when the State was ad-
mitted into th-"' Union; which was referred to the
Committee of Elections, and ordered to be printed.
ST. LOUIS CUSTOM-HOUSE, ETC.
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, in an-
swer to the resolution of the House of Repre-
sentatives of February 16, 1860, directing him to
communicate the amount required to complete,
furnish,&e., the St. Louis custom-house and post
office; which was referred to the Committee of
Ways and Means, and ordered to be printed.
TARIFF BILL.
Messrs. BARR and MAYNARD asked con-
sent to introduce bills for reference.
Mr. GARTRELL. I think the gentleman from
Maine had better adhere to his motion.
Mr. GROW. Yes; the understanding yester-
day was that there should be no business done.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I insist upon
my motion.
The motion was agreed to.
The rules were accordingly suspended; and the
House resolved itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Bcffin-
tox in the chair,) and resumed the consideration
of the bill (fl.R. No. 33#) to provide for the pay-
ment of outstanding Treasury notes, to authorize
a loan, to regulate and fix the duties on imports,
and for other purposes; on which the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Bingham] was entitled to the
floor.
Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, the annual
message of the President of the United States,
which has been referred to this committee for its
consideration, should not be passed over lightly.
It contains much that, in my judgment, is offens-
ive to the people and injurious to their interests,
and which should not be allowed to go to the
country unchallenged. It is my purpose, sir. to
speak of this paper with all the respcct that is due
