THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 4,
Bijt, sir, let us look at this subject in another
light, taking population and value of property as
the stand-point from which to view it. The fol-
lowing table, based upon the census of 18G0, pre-
sents the population and value of property in the
States embraced in the five southern circuits:
Stale*. Population. Value of Property■
Delaware  112.216 $46.2-12.181
Marvl;md  667,049 376,919,944
Vngiw'a    1,590.318 703,249,681
Ketrtuckv  1.155,684 6o6.04li.249
Missouri'  1.18*2.029 501,214.398
Arkansas   433,450 219.256,473
Tennessee   1.109.801 493.903,892
North Carolina  '992,622 358^739,399
South Carolina  703,708 548,138,754
Georgia  1,057,286 645,895,237
Florida  140,414 73,101,500
Alabama   964,201 495,037,078
Mississippi   791.305 607,324.911
Louisiana  708,022 602,118,568
Total   11.636,166 $6,-427.335.128
The State of Texas is not included in the above
table, because it is not now embraced in a judicial
circuit. The population and property slnnvn in
this table now nominally hold five of the nine
seats upon the bench of the Supreme Court of the
United States. To show the absurdity of such
an arrangement I need but present the following
table showing the population and value of prop-
erty of the States composing the other four circuits:
States. Population. Value of Property.
Maine  628.279 f 190,211,600
New Hampshire  323,073 158,310,860
Vermont  315,098 122,477,170
Massachusetts  1,231,066 815,237,433
Connecticut.   460,147 444,274,114
Rhode U'land  174,620 135.337,588
New Yoik  3,880,735 1,843,338,517
New Jersey  642.035 407,918.321
Pennsylvania  2,906,115 1,416.501,818
Ohio  2,339,510 1,193,898,422
Indiana  1,350,428 528.835.371
Illinois  1,711,951 871,860,282
Michigan  749,113 257,163,983
Total 16,745,170 ®8.443.-l6-vlS2
The free States of Wisconsin, Iowa, Minne-
sota, Kansas, California, and Oregon are omitted
because they are not included in any of the cir-
cuits, and the present bill-will not place Califor-
nia and Oregon in any circuit on account of their
remoteness from the States proposed to be em-
braced in the new circuits.
These tables show that the States now having
a majority of the judicial eiicuits of the United
States contain 5,109,004 less population, and pos-
sess $2,016,080,354 less in value of property than
theStates embraced in the minority of the circuits.
The present bill proposes to organize the States
of Delaware, Mary land, Virginia, Arkansas, Ten-
nessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and
Texas, with an aggregate population of'9,902,598,
and a total valuation of property of#5,025,328,232,
into three circuits, and thu States of Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecti-
cut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Penn-
sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wis-
consin, Kentucky, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota,
and Kansas, with a total population of 20,214,824,
arid a property valuation of $10,215,335,233,into
six circuits, as 1 will hereafter more particularly
explain. Now, when wc take into consideration
the fact that in the foregoing estimates of popula-
tion and value of property slaves are included, the
fairness of the proposition must be admitted by
every candid mind, and in no way can the pro-
posed scheme of circuit organization be chaiged
with partiality towards any section of the coun-
try.
I desire to present one other view of the present
circuit organization to show the great injustice it
involves. Before the commencement of the pres-
ent most causeless and wicked rebellion, when the
commercial and general business interests of the
country were pursuing the ordinary but crowded
and busy channels of peace, the five circuits into
which the southern States are divided presented
less business to the five circuit comts, presided
over by five southern judges, than did the States
embraced in the circuit in which now presides
Judge Swayne, to one judge, the lamented Mc-
Lean. In the latter circuit the business has been
constantly increasing, until it has aruved at a
point of accumulation which renders it uttetlv
impossible for one judge to dispose of it as the
interests of the people and the country demaud.
The following table, which goes back to the
years 1856 and 1857, when the courts of the south-
ern circuits had more business pending in them
than at any other period since their organization,
shows the number of cases on the dockets of the
several circuits named in the table on the 1st
day of January, 1856, the number added during
the year, number disposed of during that time,
and the number remaining on the several dockets
on the 1st day of January, 1857, and will show
the entire correctness of my statement:
Circuit3.
For the circuit composed of the
States of Delaware, Mary-
land, and Virginia...- 
For the fifth circuit, composed
of the Slates of Louwana
and Alabama 
For the sixth circuit, composed
of the States of Georgia and
South Caiolma   
For the eighth circuit, com-
posed <>f tin; States of Mi -
souii, Tennessee, and Ken-
tucky   
For the ninth circuity composed
of the States of Arkansas and
Mississippi 
Total for five southern circuits,
For the seventh (then Judge
McLean's)cucuit, composed
of the States ot Ohio, Indi-
ana, Illinois, and Michigan,
the returns show more busi-
ness than all the five south-
ern ciicnits.................

„ The amount of business in Jud^e Swayne's
circuit has not diminished since 1857, but has
steadily increased, and much accumulated during
the vacancy that existed from the death of Judge
McLean until the appointment of the present
^incumbent. Indeed, so great is the amount of
business in the various circuit courts in Judge
Swayne's circuit, that the several States therein
are, to a great extent, practically deprived of the
benefits of such court1?, while the States of Iowa,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Kansas, with their
great population, wealth, and business interests,
have never been included in any circuit.
When the present circuits were formed the or-
ganization of them may have been reasonably fair;
for the population of the great West at that time
was very sparse,and its business limited. Indeed,
some of the States now teeming with population,
and possessed of immense wealth, were then un-
organized, and formed the hunting grounds of
many of the western tribes of Indians. What
may have been fair then is most unfaii and unjust
now. The rapid development of the West", its
unprecedented increase in population, its great
accumulation of wealth, and its almost bound-
less commercial interests, demand corresponding
changes in the application of the machinery of
Government to them, and that, to effect these
changes in one depaitmentof the Government, the
pending bill shall become a law, either in the form
reported by the Committee on the Judiciary, or
in some not materially difforentform. And when
it so clearly appears that this bill, if enacted into
a law, will deprive no part of the country of its
just and equal share of the advantagesof our pres-
ent judicial system, but only tend to promote
justice and equality in this tespect, it is difficult
to conceive ot any reason why it should not be
speedily placed among the statutes of the nation.
The bi'l makes no change in the first circuit,
now composed of the States of Rhode Island,
I Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine; nor
; in the second circuit, embracing the States of New
! York, Connecticut, and Vermont; nor in the third,
■ comprising the States of New Jeisey and Penn-
sylvania. The fouith circuit, as organized by
I the Senate bill, and concurred in by the House
i committee, is formed of the States of Delawaie,
Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina—the
latter State being tak'-n fi om the lift h (ircuitas now
existmgand added to the fout th. The fifth ciicuit,
as constituted by the Senate and agreed to by the
House committee, is made up of the States of
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and
Mississippi—Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida
being added to supply the place ofNorth Carolina,
and to equalize the population and business of
the circuit with others. The House committee
also concur in the sixth circuit as constituted by
the Senate, and which is formed out of the States
of Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee,
being a combination of parts of the fifth, eighth,
and ninth circuits as nowconstituted,and includ-
ing Texas, which has not heretofore been attached
to any circuit.
Thus far,as already stated,the Judiciary Com-
mittee of the House concur in the Senate bill.
The amendments commence with the seventh cir-
cuit, which, by the bill as itcame from the Senate,
was composed of Kentucky and Ohio. The com-
mittee recommend that Michigan be added to this
circuit.
Theeighth circuit, in the Senate bill, was formed
of the States of Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin,
and Minnesota, a most remarkable geographical
arrangement, which the committee so change as
to make the circuit of Illinois, Indiana, and Wis- '
cousin.
The States of Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and
Kansas, make up the ninth circuit as determined
upon by the Senate. The amendment of the com-
mittee is that this circuit he formed of the States
of Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Kansas, thus
making a circuit west of the Mississippi river.
The population ofthc ninth circuit, iftheamend-
mentof the committee be adopted, will be less than
that of most of the other circuits, under the organ-
ization provided for by this bill; but in point of
business it will more than equal some of the other
circuits. The population of the proposed circuit,
according to the census of 1860, is 2,210,561. If
it should be objected to the proposed organization
of this circuit that the population of the States
asking it is not sufficient to entitle them to it, then
would 1 reply that the objection lies with much
more foice against the fifth and ninth circuits under
the now existing organization; for the former cir-
cuit has a present population of only 1,673,586,
and the latter of 1,216,823.
The reasons which have induced the committee
to recommend the formation of a circuit west of
the Mississippi river are, briefly: that no other
section of country in the United States is so rap-
idly increasing in population; that it places to-
gether States which have all adopted similar codes
of practiceand modes of procedure in their courts;
that they are all more or less affected by the laws
peculiar to the old Spanish and French grants;
that their commercial relations are closely con-
nected by the Mississippi and Missoun rivers;
and that by this ai rangemcnt provision is made in
advance for the new States which are soon to be
formed from the Territories lying west of the
States embraced in the proposed circuit.
Sir, in 1850, the district of country bounded by
the lines of the States of which it is proposed to
make this ninth circuit, had a total population of
only 880,335, represented by but nine Represent-
atives in this body, and by four Senators in the
other branch of Congress. Ten years have added
1,330,226 persons to the population, increased the
number of Senators to eight, and the next Con-
gress will find the number of Representatives in-
creased to eighteen. The increase has been rapid,
marvelous. Nothing in the history of this or any
other country exceeds it. Why, sir, my own
State has sent into the service of our common coun-
try, to aid in crushing this atrocious rebellion,
almost as many men as she had voters in 1850;
men than whom none more true, none more brave,
none more gallant ever encountered a foe on
the field of battle. The bloody fields of Pitts-
burg Landing, Fort Donelson,Belmont, Wilson's
Creek, and Blue Mills, all attest how weli and
nobly the gallant volunteersfof Iowa have done
then duty. On eveiy occasion they have heaped
honors on their Slate, and gathered harvests of
gloi y for themselves.
The second amendment proposed by the com-
mittee relates merely to the time and place for
holding the terms of the circuit court for the dis-
trict of Iowa, and authorizes one additional term
of the district court in that district. The amend-
ment is altogether local in its character, and of
course will meet with no opposition. It is necey-
sai y that there should be two terms of the district
