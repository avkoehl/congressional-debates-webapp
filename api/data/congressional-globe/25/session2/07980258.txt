lative vxlue, that is, to V e field notes afilie several
survey rs, Jie local'ly of each tract, ana the time ihe

shall dee i thut necessary to ascertain the fan value,
those public officers arc to determine it by actual in-
spection
A few moments' attention to the several conside-
rations, «Inch the amendment proposes to make
ni¡ rative upon the pubbc officers to be charged
with the valumon and classification, it seems to
nb'e, to "compromise conflicting opinions " The
h II, icfurul to the committee, embraced sutnlari-
uiil\ the pnnc pie ot valuation, bj the officers en
gaged in the sa|e of the public lands, m connection
w ith the tune they might be market The amend-
ment carries out this punciple, and prescribes more
definite!} the mode in which that duty shall be pei-
fcumed
lie amendment proposes to associate with t c
register and receiver of each land dis'nct, the snr-
vej (i genei il, or such deputy as he may designate
(hi t1 it muy, <m the purpose of valuing and as

From an examination of this law, it will be per- I
ceived that, if the surveyer has faithfully peiforme 1  i
his duty, theie will be hule difficulty in arriving at
a safe conclusion as to the value ut  any public
land, after it has first undergone the test of an am    '
tion sale, without finding a purchaser.    If the sur-
veyor has honestly  and ciietully noted  all  the |
"mates, salt  hcki, suit  ipnngi,, and mi/1 scats, ull

added to that duixtd Irom the " field-notes," ought
to satisfy the most scrupulous guaidian of the pub- I

Under all th^se restrictions and epialificat on<, ,
sir, can we not safely confide in  the judgment, '
integrity, and cireumspection of our own swoin
officers, chaiged, as they are, with the management ,
of this class of the public properl\ 1   Two ofihp
(ifticeis, the register and receiver, necessarily res d

then duty to regar 1, they will possess a gent id
topographical knowledge of the ci untrv     No ma-
terial error can be committed, unless it be willnlly
done     But, were there more   danger of under-
valuing than can be reasonably npprehended, will
you cavil with the  industrious and humble culti- |
vator of Hip soil An  the  paltry difference of i fe w  I

the Treasury to be of no greater value than the
pr ces fixed m the manner before mentioned    And
to guard against the danger of monopoly and spe-
culation, no geisoji ispermiilslf to enUr, a,t ihe reiueei
pi ices, mm e than, «* hundred and forty acres, or ene
section, in legal subdivisions, %n Im own name, or
in tlie name of any other perion Jbr his own use. It
is no pan of the policy of the new Stales, nor is it
ihe des re ol their cituens, to obtain ihe enactment
of an) la« tlut will either cncouiage speculation,
or íesult n a monopoly of the public lands. They
entertain the opinion that their wealth and stiengih
r insist m 1 numerous, free, and independent popu-
1 xtion 1 and they are too intelligent not to know
mat the best wav to attam that object is to pro-
mo e and encourige the interests of agriculture
An miepi ndent l.ody of freehe'ders, and indus-
trious ct Itu alt rs of" the soil, «.re not only always
the best fi ends if íieédom, but they furnish the
indispensable means of subsistence, and the re-
sotuces, which constitute the substratum of national
prosponty, in eveiy other department of business
\Vi h such vie^-s and sentiments as I have justly
ascnbed to the citizens of the States, comprehend-
ing the public domain, is 11 remarkable ihat they
should be dissatisfied, nay,sir, that they should even
be restive, nndc- the operation of laws which are in
diicct conflict with those opinions, and tend to dp-
teat then accomplishment' By the report ot the
C o' itmssioiior o' the General Land Office, made m
JamiKiy last, roponsue lo a resolutioa of the Se-
nate adopted at the late extra session, we are
informed there are 71,004 068 G8 acres remaining
unsold, which have been first offered for sale at
auction, and then at sale by private entry, five
years and upwards. Including the quantity which
has been since offered at public sale, and now also
subject to entiy, the quantity is increased to more
than 97,000,000 of aeres
B it, sir, as the bill does not contemplate a re-
duction ol the pnce, unless the land ¡diall have
let n in m uUet, at private entry, fi/e years or up-
war 's, I tti'l confine mjsclf to tint class By this
npoit, it appe is that moie than 14 000,(300 of
acres have bee n in market twenty years and up-
watds, and, looking back to former reports, much
ol n has been sibject to private entry twenty-five
ortluity, and some of it even as much as forty,
>eais' About 22,000,000 of acres have been m
market more than fifteen, and under twenty, years,
more than 16,000,000 of acres have been so offered
foi more than ten, and less than fifteen, >eait, and
18,517,809 acres for rhore than five, and less than
ten, years, making the grand aggregate, before
stated, fif more than 71,000,000 of acres, which
have not found a purchaser, though offered m
every manner authorized by existing jaws for five
years and upwaids
Howevei unreasonable a fixed and uniform
price for lands, of every description and quality,
may appear in the abstract, it operates vi ith pecu-
Ii ir injustice and severity upon the Southwestern
Stales, and the Territory of Florida There, we
have every variety of soil, Iron the most feilile,
productive, and valuable to the most sterile and
v ortl 'ess—alluvial, rich low grounds, mountains,
and pme barren In Alabama, out of the quantity
within hi 1 chartered limits, (estimated ntabiut
31,000 000 of <,cr.s,) inore than 29,000,000 have
bewn 1 Ikied (or sal., an 1 only about 10,000,000
ha.cbtenso'd—little moie than one-third In
Mississip, 1, (omitting fracti ns,) 20,000,000 of

country) aid only 9,000,000 sold In Louisiana,
of 6 000 000 orlen d, only o 000,000 have been sold.
In Arkansas, oí 12,ri00,0C0 rffei d only 2,000,000
