HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-4 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The falling back of General Ayres' division has deranged my plans considerably and I am getting things in order again. We lost a little ground and probably a few prisoners and some hundreds wounded. The enemy I expect lost quite as heavily, and has been compelled to fall back, too, to near his first position. Reports of the enemy moving on both flanks come in but cannot be true. I have ordered Ayres and Crawford to advance again, the former supported by General Cutler's division. Having to rally entirely upon myself I keep Griffin still in reserve to look out for flank attacks. My picket-line connects across by cavalry with the Ninth Corps. I do not at all anticipate it can be driven by the enemy, and will endeavor to advance if practicable. The enemy's infantry is of Heth's division, so I learn by prisoners, but they are not communicative. Hill, they say, is in command. If I am still on the railroad I shall take up a position to-night and intrench unless otherwise directed.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that, if the contingent objects of your instructions cannot be accomplished, you intrench as close up to the enemy's works as you can get, with your left well westward of the Weldon railroad, and remain there. This is not intended to prevent you from taking advantage of any weakness of the enemy or of withdrawing your command if in your judgment military necessity requires it.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Your dispatch per Captain Emory is just received. I have nothing further to report except that my skirmish line, in advancing, finds the enemy in the same line he took up to-day. We have to
