In this action I am happy to report that we lost no one killed and only 2 men slightly wounded.

In this, as in the battle of Sharpsburg, I can but express my entire satisfaction with the spirit and bravery manifested by officers and men. To Captain Hadden I am indebted for the skill and courage which he displayed in the management of his skirmishers. To my adjutant (Lieutenant Higgins, of Company G) I am also greatly indebted for the alacrity and coolness with which he extended my orders and bore my messages to the general under the heavy fire to which we were exposed.

I herewith submit statements of the strength of the regiment in action, with the names of the wounded. I also submit a list* of those who were absent from their commands without leave.

Numbers 276. Report of Major W. H. McCorkle, Twelfth South Carolina Infantry, of the battle of Sharpsburg and action near Shepherdstown.

OCTOBER 1, 1862

SIR: I have the honor herewith to submit reports of the part taken by the Twelfth Regiment in the battles of Sharpsburg and Shepherdstown, on September 17 and 20, respectively:

About 3 p.m. we arrived, with the Second Brigade, on the field of battle. Immediately, by order of Brigadier-General Gregg, skirmishers, under the command of Captain John L. Miller, were thrown out. The position of the enemy being soon ascertained, they were called in, and a line of battle formed of three regiments, to wit, the Thirteenth, Twelfth, and First, the Twelfth being the center and the regiment of direction. In obedience to orders, we advanced to the top of the hill, in the cornfield, and there halted a few moments, when the firing commenced. The enemy now appearing in force on the opposite hill, and at the fence in the intervening ravine, the Twelfth, at once and alone, advanced down the hill and to the fence in front. In this charge we were subjected to a terrible cross-fire in front and from both flanks. After reaching the fence we were compelled to fall back to prevent being flanked on the right the enemy on the left having been driven back. The enemy, being soon re-enforced, advanced toward us as far as the fence. Now
