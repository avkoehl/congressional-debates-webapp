HEADQUARTERS, &amp;C.,Resaca, May 16, 1864

General GARRARD,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I am directed by the general commanding to say that General Davis was ordered to cross and operate with you, predicated upon information given him from your dispatch bearer, who stated positively that the Farmer's Bridge was over the Oostenaula. A bridge (pontoon) has been ordered to Davis for you and him to cross, on at such place as you select in concert, and then operate by former order together. In case you prefer to cross at Ray's [Lay's] you then can act on McPherson's right, and Davis will join his own corps.

I am, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Resaca, Ga., May 16, 1864-11 a.m.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, Huntsville, Ala.:

You will move your command, Leggett's and Crocker's divisions, to this point as rapidly as possible, making use of the railroad as may be necessary. Your trains and artillery can come by the dirt road under charge of a strong guard.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

After two days' fighting the enemy evacuated this place last night, partly burning the railroad bridge over the river. We expect rebuild the bridge in four days. The railroad trains have, since we left Chattanooga, kept close up with the army. Trains have already arrived here, 6 p.m., with one day's forage for the whole army. The men of the army have been promptly supplied since we left Chattanooga.

L. C. EASTON.

Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Your communication of April 20 I have the honor to acknowledge.* You wish to know how many mules has the army of the Cumberland received since 1st of November. By reference to Colonel Easton, I find that this army has received from 1st of November, 1863, to this date 7,502 mules, and that it now requires about 3,000 mules to render the transportation effective.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,
