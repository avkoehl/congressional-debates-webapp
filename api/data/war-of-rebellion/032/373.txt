JUNE 17, 1863.-Affair near Wellington, Mo.

Report of Lieutenant Colonel Bazel F. Lazear, First Missouri State Militia Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS,Lexington, June 18, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that at 1 o'clock yesterday morning Lieutenant [John H.] Smith, Company I, First Missouri State Militia Cavalry, with 50 men of the different companies here, fired upon a party of 4 bushwhackers, killing 3. This was near Wellington, where they had just left after robbing a store.

I sent this party out to watch the roads, and it is the only way we can get at the scoundrels, and I shall continue to pursue this course, unless disapproved by you, and for that reason would rather that no troops be sent into this country without my being advised of it.

Very respectfully,

B. F. LAZEAR,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding First Missouri State Militia Cavalry.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Commanding District of the Border.
