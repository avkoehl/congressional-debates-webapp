POTOMAC CREEK, May 16, 1862.

Major-General MCDOWELL:

Conductor reports that Captain Harrison, of the Ninety-fifth New York, in charge of party loading dirt for siding 1 mile south of Aquia Creek Station, having retired a few steps into the woods this morning, was fired at by a supposed rebel, the ball passing through his cap and grazing his head. He fired five barrels of his revolver at the assassin, then sent a squad in pursuit without success. Guerrillas are forming in various parts of the country, provoked by rapes and other crimes committed by Union men. Cases have occurred in this vicinity recently of an aggravated character. You will require efficient protection in the rear. When I see you I can give further particulars.

H. HAUPT,

Colonel, &amp;c.
