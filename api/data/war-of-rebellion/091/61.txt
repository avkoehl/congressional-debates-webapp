HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Near Berryville, September 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say in reply to your letter* of this date that he wants you to use our own force, and to repair the railroad toward Martinsburg without regard or consultation with the construction parties of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. General Averell's train and a portion of his command was last night withdrawn to this side of the Opequon, on account of the rise in the Potomac and the impracticability of the fords. Our pickets are still at Bunker Hill, and extend to Gerrardstown. the general does not want you to go into Martinsburg, but to repair the road this side.

respectfully,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, September 9, 1864.

WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Baltimore and Ohio Railroad:

Your construction train abandoned their work this morning without sufficient reason. I do not think your "boss" should leave his work without orders. Avarell changed his position, which no doubt was the cause of alarm. I am ready to furnish proper guards, and will be responsible that no trains shall be lost or men injured. General Sheridan wants the work to go on. Just received a dispatch from him on subject.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

respectfully,
