when the pickets higher up the river reported the enemy's cavalry crossing at various places. The command was immediately got under arms and dispositions made to attack and drive them back. General Croxton's brigade on the right, General Hatch's division in the center, moved promptly out and engaged the enemy, charking him with a strong line of dismounted skirmishers, while Capron's brigade, under Colonel Harrison, looked well out to the left and rear. The Fifth Iowa Cavalry was sent to the Hillsborough pike. The action had already begun when General Croxton was informed that the rebel infantry wee crossing the river between his right and the town of Franklin. Leaving two regiments, the First Tennessee and Second Michigan, to assist in the attack against the rebel cavalry, he proceeded at once with the balance of his brigade to drive back the force reported to be crossing below. He soon discovered, however, that the report was false, and moved promptly against the rebel cavalry. Hatch had already attacked with vigor and begun driving them rapidly back. The men seemed inspired with the greatest courage and determination, and in a very short time had repulsed the enemy at every point. By night the whole force was driven beyond the Harpeth. The accompanying sketch* will show the importance of this success on the part of the cavalry over Forrest's force, while the hard-pressed infantry were nobly repelling Hood's furious assaults against the defenses of Franklin.

General Schofield, having withdrawn the infantry to the north bank of the river during the night and determined to continue his march toward Nashville, directed me to remain with the Cavalry Corps in the position it then held till daylight on the morning of December 1, and then to retire, covering the rear and flanks of the infantry. This order was complied with, the enemy having been so severely handled the day previous as to be unable to follow until he found the road clear. Hammond's brigade, followed by Hatch, moved by a country road to the Wilson pike, near Edmonson's house; Croxton marched parallel to the Franklin pike. At Wilson's Mill Hammond was found encamped and left to bring up feed, Hammond was delayed longer than was intended and in withdrawing was attacked by the rebel cavalry, but succeeded, with slight loss, in repelling the enemy. From the neighborhood of Brentwood, after the infantry had halted, the whole command marched by various country road to Thompson's Chapel, on the Nolensville pike, where it took up a strong defensive position for the night. Before daylight the next morning it marched to Nashville, and late in the evening crossed to the north side of the Cumberland River and encamped in Edgefield.

During the ensuing ten days every effort was made to put the corps in an efficient condition. Clothes were drawn for the men; the horses were shod; extra shoes were fitted; and every horse that could be drawn from the corrals of broken-down stock, or reached in Tennessee or Southern Kentucky, was taken. By these means the Cavalry Corps, exclusive of La Grange's and Watkins' brigades, of the First Division, was increased by nearly 9,000 mounted men. Besides this, two brigades of 1,500 men each were organized out of the dismounted men previously assembled at the cavalry depot near Nashville. While in camp the river was carefully watched by the Seventh Ohio Cavalry, from Nashville to the vicinity of Clarksville.

On the 2nd of December Brevet Brigadier-General Hammond was ordered with his brigade to Gallatin for the purpose of watching the
