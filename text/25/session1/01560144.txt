most speedily
Mr CAM BRELENG reminded the House that
it was then ten o'clock at night, and that the pro-
position before them was the only one impeding
lheir progress.
Several gentlemen expiessed opinions favorable
to immediate action on the amendment, and Mr
GRAVES hoped that the gentleman from New
York, (Mr. Loomis,) would withdraw his mo-
tion, which suggestion was complied with bv the
UUer.
The question hems; on concurrence with the Se-
nate m their amendments,
Mr WISE called for a count, which was order-
ed, and it appe ired that the Hou*>e was without a
quorum
A motion being made to pioceed with the con-
sideration of the subject before the Hou«e,
Mr WISE would not consent to act on a mat-
ter so impoit nt in that --late of the House Here

transact which, 240 had been sent here' Nor wps
mere a quoium in tie Senate, eilher, and on a bill

Mr HOWARD moved that the House non-con-
cur wuih the Señale in its proposed amendment,
with a view t> a conference between the two
Houses

quorum m the Sen Ue nor in i le H< use
Mr ADAMS «.aid, the House can neither con-
cur nornon-concur It «as then Sutidav mornng,
he ob'erved, and he would move that the House

stances    I cill /or the yeas and nays
The yeas and n iv  were ordeied, and the vote

Mr CAMBRELENG then said that it wou'd
be subjecting ihe memhers present to too much in-
convenience io keep tb'mi heie during the tedious
proi ess of a c«U < f the House, so late at night
But, if the officers of the Hous= do ih ¡r duty, a

sent B«*fup any question could be entertained,
the presence of members must be compelled
Mi LEWIS Let us have a call rf the House,
then, and compel the otiendance of members
Mr ADAMS would not consent to act upon
any question without a quoium. This bill he con-
sidered as the price of the deposite postponement
bill, passed this session by Congress, and a mea-
sure of too much importance to be aottd upon in
tbMstae of the House He muid sit iheie till
Monday morning, it itqtnred, bit he, for one,
would not do bus ness with only eighty members
present

Mr  NORVELL p evented  a memoria], which
VtSt ordered io lie on tbe tab t
Mr LINN offered a resolution w hu h was agreed
so, eal'mson the Pie-ident to fmnish (if not in-
compatible with the pubbc interests) at  an eerlv
period of the next session, any conespondenee
that may have taken place between this Govern-
ment and foreign powers, m relation to our temtory

A message was icceived from the House of Re-
presentatives, stating its concunence in the
amendment of the Senate to the bill extending the
indulgence to the late depos'te banks
Mr NORVELL thpn moved ihat the Chair ap-
point a committee on the pait of ihe Senate to meet
on the part of the House to wait on the President,
and ask if he had any further business
Messis NORVELL and CL1Y of Alabama

of the House, when, after a few moments,
Mr NORVELL announced that the committee
bad waited on the President, and been informed
that he had no further business for the Senate but

The House, pursuant to the older adopted on

On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG, the ordi-
dimrv business of oiling ior pe uions and re| oits

DEPOSITE BANKS
Th" House then resumed the consider Kion of the
amendment of ihe Seriate to trie bill granting indul-
gence to the deposite banks de< lanng the lime at
whuh payment of inteiest on balance  due shall
commence, vi? from the date of any default or
neglect to pay any diaft or requisition of the Trea-
surv
Mr HAYNES said a few words on the amend
menf in relation to its apphtation onlv to banks
which had been delinquent This excluded from
the provisions of the bill en'irely those w nich had
no   been diawn upon at all
Mi ADAMS spokp with warmth in opposit on
to the bill and amendment Its pr< visions having
icference to the first section of the bill, would, m
effect, apply not to banl s which weie delinquent,
but involve^ the ab«urditv of applying it on'y to
banks which were not delinquent Mr A said he
had demonstrated this at a previous sntms to the
ffonve'ion, lie believed, of everv one who had
heaid him The chairman of the Committee of
Wiys and Means had not so much a* attemp'ed to
answer Ihe argument And, Mr A now declared,
in the presence of this Hin.se, that if this hi'l was
to go forth to the nation wnh that section m it, it
would be a disgrace to onr legislation Ihe first
section of the bill extendi d relief to those banks
only which were not delinquent, and, as ti e
amendment had reference to the same banks, it
would, m fact, have no operation at all, unless
from a conductive power in the Secretary of the
Tieisury, and a friudful apphca'ion of it to such
banks as were delinquent If the obstinate
pel severance of the channan of the Committee
of Ways and Means m forung this bill through
the H< use with this ohvi< us absurdity or its fice
was to succeed, it «hould not be at least w ithont
opposition on tne part of Mr A Heucn'd read
the first section once more, and would demons'iaie
i spcond time, that it had icfeienee only to banks
which were not delinquent let ihe chairman
(tried Mr A) answer me, if he can [Mi <V
here read the section leferred to ] What a power
(siid he) is here given to the Secretary of the
Treasnrj i Thepowei of se'eci nc; and discn m-
nat ng between bank and bank, at his pleasur- of
n fusing to ppnly the benefits of the act to an/
bank he chc-e, f< r he might reply to its application
fir relief "You have rot complied with the requi-
sitions of the Department, and thereftrp you can
not be relieved ' While, when a similar applica-
tion was made by another bank whom he wished
to favor, he might pass over the natter m perfect
silence and grant the request It cRve mm )np
power of a double construction, and under that
power he might se'ect any bank he those to mm,
and any other he chose to s>ve, and apply tne one
construction or the other as best suited his purpose
It carried either fraud or absurdity upon its face
Mi A then went into a recapitulation of what
had passed m the House on SatuicUy in i elation to
the b II, characterizing the amendment offered by
Mr Loomis, of New York, a  proposing nothing
but simple, rigorous, abstract justice to the States
which had been injured by the postponement of the
deposites, by requiring that the banks of those
States which held large amounts of money which
w ould, but for that postponement, have gone to
othet States, should pay legal interest for its i.ie
The subsequent amendment offered by Mr John-
son of Louisiana, he referred to a consummation
of ihe bargain which, he said, had been with so
much decency consummated in the face of the
Hou^e between the chairman of the Committee of
Wsvi and Means and certain g utlemen from
Louisiana, vvh< se \ otes, he wanted to pass his post-
ponement bdl
Mi RICE GARLAND heic interpo ed Do"s
the gentleman refer to me?
Mr ADAMS 1 refer to no individual what-
ever
Mr R GARLAND Am I the gentleman from
Louisiana re'ened to?
Mr ADAMS I did not allude to him moie
than to other gentlemen c uning from those Stab s
where th s money lies I had no par'icular refe-
rence to one of them moie thai) to an iiher
Mr CHAPMAN I am the on'} ohVi member
\vho can be alluded to I made no bargain of any
sort about the matter I have been no devoied
friend to the mearme fiom its inception to its con-
summation The centleman, therefoie, can not
refer to me In truth, I do not believe this bill
will be of any benefit to the  deposite banks at all
Mr ADAMS. I did not allude to that gentle-
man—far from it, I am fully aware that he pre-
feried that the bill should not pass I would to God
that all the gentleman coming from the States most
interested could say the same. I íepeat that the
bargain was printed out by the gentleman from
Georgia, (Mr Dawson) and a gentleman from
Missouri, at the very time it took place, and I «ay
further, that I take this amendment to be the con-
summation of that bargain. When it was pur-
posed, in committee, that the bill to pospone the
deposites should le laid aside until thi= bill for the
rel ef of the banks should fiist be acted upon, the
chairman of the committee did openly pledge him-
self, when lesisung that arrangement, that those
b inks should be hbeially dealt with and here we
have the fulfdoent of that pledge
Mi CVVtBRELENG I  it m order to refei,
11 the House, to what passed in-Committee oí the
Whole
The SPEAKER was replying, w lien Mi An vms
sa d he hopid the Chairman of the Committee ot
Wav- and Mtirs would not be sufeied io put
him down He should dec aie the di giacefut
=cen , whitever mteiest lha*gentleman might have
in shutting his mouth
Mr CAMBRELEVG     It is disgraceful to you,
if to any one , and this is not the fiist time the gen-
t'eman has attempted to retaid and defeat the pub-
lic husn ess by talking it down      I  insist,   Xvir
Sppikei   upon the point of order
Th( CHAIR heie pronounced ituhrlh out of
cder to refer, in the House, to what hod bt^n said
or done in Committee ot the Whole
Mi ADAMS then said he would pnticise—
and would suppose that certain facts had trans-
pired, not here, but in another Legishluie—in the
moon if gent'emen pleased He then repelled
what he had befoie stated as to the history of the
amendments to the bill When the amendments
weie s'ill pending, the objections all urped, and
none of them answered, tne b '1 had been laid
aside, other bills had been taken up, w hen the rom-
mit'ec rose aid repoited piogicss on the whole
Immediately thereupon it had been moved by a
member fiom Maim, that the Committee of the
Whole be d^charged from the fui ther considera-
tion of this bill, the effect of which was to cut off
the amerdment of the genilt-man from New Yoik,
