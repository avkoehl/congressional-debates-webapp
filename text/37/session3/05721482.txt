cannot report.

So a call of the House was ordered.
Mr.VALLANDIGHAM. As there isaquo-
rum present, I move to reconsider the vote by
which a call of the House was ordered, and on
that motion I demand the yeas and nays.
Mr. COLFAX. I rise to a point of order. The
House having ordered a call, it cannot be recon-
sidered until the call is executed.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. We had this very
question decided the other day.
The SPEAKER. The House has not yet
commenced the call.
Mr. COLFAX. The House has determined
that there shall be a call.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman moves to
reconsider the vote by which the call was ordered
before the House has commenced the execution
of the order.
Mr. MOORHEAD moved to lay the motion to
reconsider upon the table.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM demanded the yeas
and nays.
Mr. COLFAX called for tellers on the yeas
and nays.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Ancona and
Colfax were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reported-
ayes 24, noes 79.
So the yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. WILSON. 1 ask leave to make a propo-
sition to the House in relation to this bill.
The SPEAKER. If there is no objection the
gentleman will be heard.
[Cries of "Agreed!" and "No objection!',l
Mr. WILSON. My proposition is that the oil]
be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary,
with leave to report it back at any time.
Mr. PENDLETON. I shall be satisfied with
that arrangement.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. And I am willing
to agree to that.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I would like to
make a suggestion to the House. I have no de-
sire to press a vote at this time if there can be any
assurance that a vote shall be had upon the bill.
I am willing to agiee that the bill shall be referred
to ^he Committee on the Judiciary, with leave to r
report at any time, on the condition that when it
is reported back the usual and ordinary course of
legislation shall be pursued without any of this
fUlihustermg and motions for delay.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. It is unnecessary
to have any understanding of that kind. Let the
committee have leave to report at any time.
Mr. PENDLETON. Let the bill be referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary, with leave to
report itac any time.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. It is too apparent
that that course would defeat the bill, and I can-
not agrfie to such a proposition in relation to any
bill of which I am in favor. J therefore object.
The hour of half past four having now arrived,
Mr. COLFAX objected to the House taking a
recess
The SPEAKER. The Chair witi submit the
question to the House, "Shall the House take a
recess?"
