mouth I will keep you advised by telegraph of your progress and prospects. Would it not be well toi prepare for drawing on the Northern Central, and other roads, foir additional marchinery, if required? I trust all due preparation will be made to make the troops as comfortable as possible, as I found going over the mountain it was very cold, and without fires it would have been exteemely uncomfortable. The certified report to me is 3,000 more than was supposed by the Assistant Secretary.

Very truly, yours,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
