WARRENTON JUNCTION, [August 27, 1862]-2.20 p.m.

General McDOWELL:

I have information, upon which I rely, from aides of Generals Banks and signal corps, reporting what fell under their own observation-that a heavy column of the enemy moved yesterday across the Sperryville pike in the direction of Gaines' Cross-Roads and Salem, passing along the east base of Buck Mountain. It is this movement of the enemy that I desire very much to know about, if it can be ascertained by observation.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

RAPPAHANNOCK, August 27, 1862-6 p.m.

Colonel SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: The river is fordable at both fords for cavalry and long-legged infantry. Some 200 cavalry and infantry have crossed at the upper ford, and driven in our pickets about half a mile. We see cavalry and guns mounted near the bridge; they make no attempt to cross. The large baggage train across the river has all gone. Some regiments of Heintzelman's infantry are 3 miles up the railroad.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N. DUFFIE,

Colonel Rhode Island Cavalry.

Can't the cars run down here?
