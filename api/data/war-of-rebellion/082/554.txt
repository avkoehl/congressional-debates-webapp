Major-General MEADE

Commanding, &amp;c.;

I think it will be well to stop all artillery firing except from field pieces from this time until Saturday morning and to conceal the heavy pieces. This may have an effect in convincing the enemy that we are withdrawing from Petersburg and possibly induce them to come out and see.

Respecting telegram* of General Hancock of 2 p.m., the prisoner may confound Bushrod Johnson's old brigade with his division. Colonel Sharpe reported this morning that the Tennessee brigade of Beauregard's corps was on the other side of the James. This was Bushrod Johnson's brigade, and is one of the five brigades of his division. I have telegraphed General Hancock about it.
