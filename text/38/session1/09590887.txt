1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
Committee of the Whole. It proposes to direct
the Secretary of the Treasury to issue, or cause
to be issued, executed, and delivered, to E. F.and
Samuel A. Wood duplicates of the following de-
scribed bonds of the United States of America,
Treasury Department, for the Oregon war debt,
issued under an act of Congress approved March
2, 1861, payable at any time after July 1, 1881,
at the Treasury of the United States, with inter-
est at the rate of six percent, perannum, namely:
Nos. 1329 and 1334 to 1338, inclusive, for the sum
of $500 each, and No. 271 for fifty dollars,dated
Washington, March 24, 1862, and Nos. 1352 to
1359, inclusive, for ยง500 each; No. 665 for $100,
and No. 266 for fifty dollars, dated Washington,
March 24, 1862, and No. 877 for $100; No. 400
forfifty dollars, dated Washington, May 22,1862,
and each and severally signed L. E. Chittenden,
Register of the Treasury, entered R. E., recorded
J. O., with thirty-seven interest coupons attached
to each of the $500 bonds for fifteen dollars each,
payable semi-annually; eighteen interest coupons
attached to bond No. 665, and nineteen interest
coupons attached to bond No. 877 for six dollars
each; eighteen interest coupons attached to bonds
Nos. 266 and 271; nineteen interest coupons at-
tached to bond No. 400 for three dollars each,
payable annually; all of which coupons are signed
" G. LufF, for the Register of the Treasury;" in
all nineteen Oregon war bonds, amounting to the
sum of ยง7,350; but before the issue of duplicate
bonds E. P. and Samuel A. Wood, or either of
them, must execute, orcauseto be executed,and
deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury, to
his full acceptance and satisfaction, such bond of
indemnity as is usually required by the regula-
tions of the Treasury Department for the issue of
duplicate certificates of inscribed stocks and bonds.
Mr. JOHNSON. Were the original bonds lost?
Mr. CLARK. Yes, sir.
Mr. ANTHONY. It is a case where the me-
morialists mailed at San Francisco for New York
certain Oregon war debt bonds, and sent them by
the steamer Golden Gate, which with her mails
was lost. The evidence that the bonds were mailed
is perfect, taken before a notary, attested by the
notarial seal, and the proof of the whole transac-
tion is complete. The bill provides that dupli-
cates shall be issued on the memorialists filing a
bond with the Secretary of the Treasury satisfac-
toiy to him, to reimburse the United States in
case the originals shall ever appear. Such is the
usual practice of the Department in such cases,
I believe.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, and was read the third time, and passed.
LAND GttANT TO A MINNESOTA RAILROAD.
Mr. RAMSEY. I desire to call up Senate bill
No. 31, making a grant of lands to the Lake Su-
perior and Mississippi Railroad Company, in the
State of Minnesota, to aid in the construction of
the railroad ofsaid company from St. Paul to Lake
Superior, with a view of modifying an amend-
ment which I offered several days since, and having
it printed.
The motion to take up the bill was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY. I propose now to amend the
amendment of the Committee on PublicLands in
the first section by striking out after the word
"Minnesota" to the end of the section, and in-
serting what I send to the Chair; which I desire
to have printed.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Foster
in the chair.) The proposed amendment will be
read.
Mr. HARLAN. I understand that the Sena-
tor from Minnesota merely desires to have his
amendment printed, and then will permit the bill
to go over.
Mr. RAMSEY. That is what I desire.
The amendment was ordered to be printed.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I understand that this is
a very material amendment to the bill, changing it
in important particulars. If so, it ought to goto
the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. RAMSEY. It is not material. It is a
very slight alteration of the original amendment.
Mr. HARLAN. I suggest to the Senator from
Indiana that when the amendment shall have been
printed we can then see what it is, and if it shall
be necessary to refer it he can then make the mo-
tion.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I have no objection to the
motion to print, but I want the bill then to belaid
over. 7
The further consideration of the bill was post-
poned till to-morrow.
POST ROADS IN NEW. JERSEY.
Mr. WILSON. I move that the bill (ยง. No.
102) to establish certain post roads, to regulate
commerce among the States, and for other pur-
poses, be taken from the table and referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia.
It was laid upon the table on my motion.
The motion was agreed to.
MARGARET M. STAFFORD.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask the indulgence of the
Senate to pass a bill granting a pension to the
widow of a man who was killed in the service of
the Government, which was reported by the Com-
mittee on Pensions yesterday morning. The case
is a very clear one, and I hope the bill will be
passed at once. I move that Senate bill No. 139
be now taken up.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S.
No. 139) for the relief of Margaret M. Stafford,
widow of Reuben Stafford, of Coshocton county,
Ohio, was read the second time. It is a direction
to the Secretary of the Interior to place the name
of Margaret M. Stafford, widow of Reuben Staf-
ford, of Coshocton county, Ohio, on the pension
roll, at the rate of eight dollars per month, to
commence on the 26th of August, 1863, and to
continue during her widowhood.
Reuben Stafford was requested by the deputy
provost marshal, in accordance with instructions
from the district provost marshal,under paragraph
twenty-five of instructions to provost marshals,
to assist in arresting a number of drafted men in
Crawford township, in Coshocton county,Ohio.
Stafford, while attempting to arrest two drafted
men, was instantly killed by them while in the
faithful discharge of his duty. The committee
think that the duty in the performance of which
the husband of the petitioner was killed was a
part of the military service of the United Slates,
and on that ground the bill is based.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, and was read the third time, and passed.
SALE OF LIQUOR TO INDIANS.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I ask the Senate to take
up and pass a bill which was reported this morn-
ing from the Committee on Indian Affairs. It
wilL take but a moment. It has but a single ob-
ject. It is simply to amend the existing law for
the punishment of the offense of selling liquor to
Indians, by conferring jurisdiction on the circuit
as well as the district courts of the United States.
The only change it makes in the existing law is
to insert the two words " or circuit," so that the
indictment may be in the proper district or circuit
court. I move to take up the bill.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S. No.
120) to amend an act entitled "An act to regulate
trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and
to preserve peace on the frontiers," approved
June 30, 1834, was considered as in Committee
of the Whole. It proposes to amend the twen-
tieth section of (he act of June 30, 1834,*so as to
read as follows:
Sec. 20. And be it further enacted, That if any person
shall sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirit-
uous liquor o  wine to any Indian undei the chaige of any
Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the
United States, or shall introduce or attempt to introduce
any spiutuous liquor or wineinto the Indian country, such
peif-on on conviction thereof before the proper district or
circuit couit of the United States shall be imprisoned lor a
period not exceeding two years, and shall be fined not more
than $300. Provided, however, Thdtitshallbea&ufficient
defense to any charge of inttoducing or attempting to in-
troduce liquor into the Indian country if it bepioved to be
done by order of the War Department or of any officer duly
authorised thereto by the War Department. And if any
supeiintendentof Indian affairs,Indian agent,or sub-agent,
or commanding officer of a military post, has reason to
suspect or is informed that any white person or Indian is
about to introduce or has introduced any spirituous liquor
or wine into the Indian country in violation ot the provis-
ions of this section, it shall be lawful for such superintend-
ent, Indian agent, or sub-agent, oi commanding officer, to
cause the boat*, stores, packages, wagons, sleds, and places
of deposit of such peison to be searched, and if any such
spirituous liquor or wine is found therein, the same, to-
gethei with the boats, teams, wagons, and sled?; used in
, conveying the same, and the peltries ot such peison, shall
i he seized and delivered to the proper officer, and shall be
! pioceedtd against by libel in the proper coui t, and forfeited,
one half to the use of the informer, and the other half to
the use of the United States, and if such person i* a trader,
his iiceafee shall be revoked and his bond putin suii. โข Aim
it shall moreover be lawful for any persou in the service of
the United States or for any Indian to take and destroy any
ardent spirits or wine found in the Indian country, except
such as may be introduced therein by the War Department.
In all cases arising under this act, Indians shall be com-
petent witnesses.
Mr. CONNESS. In the latter part of the sec-
tion, where it reads that "it shall, moreover, be
lawful for any person in the service of the United
States" to destroy liquor found in the Indian
country, I move to amend by striking out " law-
ful for" and inserting " duty of," so that it shall
be the duty of officers to do the thing required.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendment was concurred in. The bill
was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading,
and was read the third time, and passed.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Mr. SUMNER. I move to take up the bill
(S. No. 53) for the relief of Henry P. Blanchard,
reported from the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. GRIMES. The Senator from Massachu-
setts, I apprehend, has accomplished all that he is
desirous of accomplishing now; he has got the
bill before the Senate. There is evidently not a
quorum here, and I am unwilling to.go on any
longer in the transaction of public business with-
out a quorum. I therefore move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive business,
i think the business that will come up in execu-
tive session will be such that a majority will soon
be present after the doors are closed.
Mr. SUMNER. This is a small bill which I
think can be acted on in three or four minutes; it
is a bill for the relief of an individual; the facts
are very few, the case simple, justice clear; and
there is a very brief report which the Senator can
hear if he requires it.
Mr. JOHNSON. I understand the member
from Iowa to propose to go into executive ses-
sion and not to go on with the present bill, because
there is not a quorum present; he is unwilling to
do any business in open session for that reason.
I want to know if there is to beany business done
in executive session.
Mr. GRIMES. I think that if we go into ex-
ecutive session we shall soon have a quorum by
sending out for members who are in the building.
The bill of the Senator from Massachusetts may
be a very small bill in its amount; but it may es-
tablish important principles, and I do not think*
it right for u4? to go on here in the transaction of
business with not more than twenty Senators
present. The bill can wait; it will come up as a
matter of course in the morning.
Mr. SUMNER. Very well; I will make no
further objection.
The motion of Mr. GRIMES was agreed to;
and after some time spent in executive session, the
doors were reopened, and the Senate adjourned.

Mr. PRICE. I ask unanimous consent of the
House to introduce the following resolution:
Resolved, That hereafter, for the purpose of facilitating
business and effecting an adjournment as eaily as the first
week in May, this House will Hold night sessions as often
as four nights in each week, commencing with Wednesday

day until the time of adjournment.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I object.
EXCHANGE OF BONDS.
Mr. P. CLARKE, by unanimous consent,in-
troduced the following resolution; which was read,
considered, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Committee of Ways and Means are
hereby instructed to inquire into the expediency of establish-
ing an office m thecitj ol New York, under the direction of
the United States Assistant Treasurer in that city, lor the
transfer of Government bonds; and also as to the expedi-
ency of authorizing the exchange of registered and coupon
bonds, one for the other, as holders maydesne; and report
by bill oi otherwise.
