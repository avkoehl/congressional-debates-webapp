ward supplies to Iuka, and will have another division up with you as soon as I learn when Carr can return from La Grange. All my corps should be in by to-morrow night, when I will come forward.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

IUKA, October 15, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Should it be your intention to have floating bridge constructed at Eastport it will be well to secure a number of small anchors which I know are at Columbus, and also cable chains, &amp;c. The railroad will be completed to Bear Creek after to-morrow.

OSTERHAUS.

IUKA, October 15, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

To carry 100 extra rounds of infantry, and proportional number of artillery ammunition, this division wants from forty-five to fifty army wagons. Can Colonel Smith furnish them?

OSTERHAUS.

CORINTH, October 15, 1863.

General OSTERHAUS,

Iuka:

We have brought forward all the wagons we can raise. I can tell the exact number. We will send forage to Iuka, and then the train will come forward and be distributed pro rata. Corse report the road so bad that he will hardly get all his division in till day after to-morrow. I except Carr and Dodge to-morrow, when I will make the others for march. I propose to start from Iuka and Bear Creek with wagons and finish the road to Tuscumbia behind us. I don't propose a floating bridge at Eastport, but would like all boats to be collected in the mouth of Bear Creek for another purpose.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

IUKA, October 15, 1863.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

A bridge across Bear Creek can be constructed in one hour's time. There are one hundred and twenty boats on the Tennessee within 5 miles of Eastport.

OSTERHAUS.

POCAHONTAS, October 15, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The roads are execrable. Troops much wearied, but I will try and force three brigades into Corinth by to-morrow night. The rear brigade in charge of the division train will have to remain here to-night, as the bridges across Muddy are very bad.

JNumbers M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.
