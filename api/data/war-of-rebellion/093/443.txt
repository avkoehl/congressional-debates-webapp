many gallant officers and soldiers. It mainly fell upon the Tenth Minnesota Infantry, which was exposed to a flanking fire. Two field officers, 6 line officers, wounded, and some 60 enlisted men killed and wounded in this charge alone, attest the fiery ordeal through which the regiment passed; and the fact that it reached the rebel works in its front as quickly as the regiments on its right, which were less exposed, is ample evidence of the courage and daring of both officers and men. Lieutenant-Colonel Jennison, the commanding officer, was conspicuous for his high daring, and set a noble example to his officers and men. He fell severely wounded on the enemy's works, and his loss, even if but temporary, will be severely felt by his regiment. Lieutenant-Colonels Brumback and Eaton, Captains Johnson and Hubbard, commanding regiments, acquitted themselves on this occasion, as they always do, with distinguished gallantry, setting their respective commands examples which must always insure success. In fact, all officers and men of this brigade engaged on the 15th and 16th instant displayed an eager desire to engage the enemy, and a courage tempered with a high resolve rarely, if ever, surpassed. To Lieutenant McClaury, his officers and men, I am under particular obligations for their bravery and efficiency in working their battery. Although but recently attached, they have already won the esteem and admiration of the entire command.
