a portion of the cavalry, and that three armies are now doing duty in the field. Last night 500 cavalry were sent to Moorefield and Petersburg to cut off the raiders. I will send report by letter to-day.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY,

Washington:

There is no strong force of the enemy between here and Woodstock. Our cavalry occupied Strasburg and Front Royal on a reconnaissance, and part of it was as far as Woodstock. The enemy's cavalry, about 200, retired from Woodstock toward Staunton. Two battalions of rebel cavalry are at Luray. Mosby's cavalry is in Loudoun Country. Please inform me how many regiments in all have been ordered to this department.

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.

Colonel GEORGE H. SHARPE:

The old man is just in from Little Washington, and reports the country clear below there as far s Staunton. U. S. deserters are coming in here daily. I have detected eight in disguise.

WHEELING, May 7, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

The people at Western and beyond seem to be very fearful of a raid. A small force would quiet them. Can't you put a few men in that quarter?

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor.

CUMBERLAND, MD., May 7, 1864.

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling:

Under my present orders, I have some doubt whether I am authorized to send troops away from the line of the railroad; nevertheless, I have taken the responsibility to do so. I have ordered the Fourth Virginia Infantry to Clarksburg, and directed two companies with a squad from Maulsby's battery with one gun to proceed at once to Weston. All quiet in this region.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
