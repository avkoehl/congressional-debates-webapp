General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

The enemy attacked me at 7 a. m. to-day; after a spirited fight, were repulsed with several lost on his side. Prisoners report Stoneman at Christiansburg, and say that he has sent troops on several roads, all of which are to concentrate at Danville. The force which attacked me was 800 strong. Our loss small. I am now on the pike between Henry Court-House and Danville. Have scouts watching enemy, and will report any movements.
