standing armies, lest they should be used to the
destiuction of our own liberties, prefer to depend
entirely on militia, whi'e others, from their com-
parative inefficiency, consider that their employ-
ment should, if possible, be avoided Por my own
pan, I consider that "both are important to the
well-being and protection of the slate, and
«hile I cannot fear the contemplated danger of a
force of 15,000, or even 20,000 men, scattered
over 8,500 miles of frontier, I would not unneces-
sarily 'ncrea^e it, but lather wouli keep it below
whai might Iip considered by some as necessaiy to
our safety and honor With a militia force of one
million and a h<ilf, where can be the danger of a
small, but well appointed army, drawn irom the
>,reat body of the | eople, our relations and our
friend^, educated as ourselves, and imbued -with
Ihe same holy tore of libeity ihat characterizes
every American? Supposing the power to exist,
cm such men be formidable to the hbert es of our
common countrj? Although history may afford
some sinking eximples, when a lawless soldiery,
under an ambitious leader, have violated their du-
ty to the state, I recollect of no instance of their
eventHal success, nor could it happen until ihe
great body of the people had become degraded, and
existed only as the leadv prey of the first invader,
foreign or domestic But how many more cases
can be found of armies devoted to the rights and
liberties of their common country? Then, why
should we consider the American soldier devoid of
those high attributes which adorn the private citi-
zen' Why suppose him less patriotic, and less de-
voted to the common interest? Is there any thing
in the history oí our own country which would
warrant such a conclusion^ On the contrary, does
not every page of our shoit, bu-t evemTul, story
warrant a conclusion directly the reverse?
Now, sir, while I am willing to grant every se-
curity to the Western fiontier of the United States,
I claim equal protection ior the North and East,
and seaboard of our country. At this instant, Great
Britain has 40 000 men m arms in Canada, and
5,000 in New Brunswick, great excitement exists
on both sides of the tronuer, and troops are neces-
sary for the protection and the execution of our
own laws And I here Uaim, as one of the Repre-
stntalues of the State of New York, that this Con-
gress will so act upon the subject as to place us in
safety, without endangering other portions of the
Union It is due to justice and to the interests of
ihe United S ates, for fiom New Yoik we derive
the largest portion of our fiscal resouices, and her
position renders her, independently of hei popula-
tion, of equal, if not greater, importance to the na-
tion than any other State in this Union
There wer' so ne points of difference of opinion
with the military committee, to vhich the chair-
man has adverted in his speech, which I wish, at
this time, to respond to, and particularly in relation
to the transfer of an officer from each of the com-
panies ot artillery These companies, when used
as light infantry or in the field, are oigamzed into
three divisions ofiwo guns each, in all six guns
a lieutenant command , two guns, one lieutenant
has charge of the ai munition, one acts as aid-de-
c?mp to pass the orders, and the captain commands
the whole Thus, if \ou take off ore lieutenant,
you must reduce the effective force of the company
two guns, or one th rd of its power At other
times the artillery ísemployed in detachments, and,
in such, a greater number of officers i> always re-
quired, as, no detachment can be made with less
than two officers The two principal amendments
which I have offered to the bill consisr, first, m an I
equalization of the pay of the whole army, con- |
ceivmg it unjust that those who seive in the field
should be worse paid than those whe are comfoita-
bly accommodated here or elsewhere. The next
is a plan to enable oflicers «ho hive served their
Ihes m the arm}', but are no  worn out or muti-
lated and unfit for active duty, to retire upon their
pay proper There are many such who now re-
ceive their full pay, because there is no provision
otheiwise for them, mit who would be glad to re
tire upon a pittance At a proper time, I ?hall I
more fully state the case to the House, considering ¡
it, as I do, an act of justice, policy and sound |
economy.                                                           j

INCREASE OF THE ¿RMY.
DEBATE IN THE SENATE,
Wednesday, Jily 4, 1838.
On the bill "to increase the present mi'nary esta-
blishment of the United S ates, and for otter pur-
poses "
Mr BENTON ha-ving bnefly explained the ob-
ject of the bill—
Mr. PIERCE of New Hampshire said that he
had never found n more difficult to determine what
■was his duty, than on the present occasion That
an inciease ol the military loice was highly neces-
sary, if i ot indispensable, be believed was very
gen°rally admitted, and he had ftlt upnn lh« sub-
ject, írdividuálly, no ordinary soluude It yas
demanded by the present relations of the country,
by the unhappy and unquiei state of things en our
widely extended borders, o>i the North and on the
Ea&t, B9 well as on the South and West Thecal!
at this moment comes alike ircn^our Southern and
Western fionter, and along the Eastern and
Northern boundary from MadaWaska to the lakes
He was not disposed to disregard ihe necessity which
was urged in favor of ihe bill A sufficient foroe
should be provided for the preservation of our near
terality, and to afford lo oar border inhabitants the
protection which they have a right to demand at
our hands. His embarrassment, on the occasion,
arose from the fact, that the bill had reached a
stage in its progress, when it was impossible to
amend it, and it embraced provisions, m his judg-
ment, most unequal and unjust. It was empha-
tically a staff bill, and lie would not allow the in-
vidious distinctions made between the, ofecers con-
nected will} the bureaus of_ thai department and
the line of the array to pass m silence, aUeasi <aie
voice-should be raised for those who were not here
to speak for themselves, and who are hardly
heard of in Washington, except in Ihe official re-
ports from t ie Iropucr, oi from the battle field
Mi F said he should not, at this late hour, feel
justified to crter upon a deta 'ed argument, or at-
tempt any nice f nal} sis of the bill, but he would
notice «orne of Us provisions, which were as extra-
ordinary as they were unjust Let it be known to
the countrj, said Mr P Uiat th s bill provides foi
an increase of one hundred and fortj-six office ,
that ore hundred and thirty-three out of the one
hundred and forty six are for the staff, and thirteen
for the lice, of the army, and let it be known, too,
that in this reorgan zation of the staff, and in ita;
immense increase, promotion is exclusively to ac-
crue to those officers who now hold places n th s
favored arm of tne service
Look, foi instance, at the fourth and fifth sec-
tions of the bill. They provide " That the co-ps
of topographicpl engineers shall be organized and
increased by regular pntnolions  the same, so that
the said corps shall consist of one colonel, one lieu-
tenant colonel, four raajois, ten captains, ten first
lieutenants, and ten second lieutenants, that vacan-
cies created by sa.d oigarnzátion, o\er and above
those which can be filled by rhepre cnt corps, shall
be taken frcm the armv, and from such as it may
be deemed advisab'e ot the civil engineers," &c It
would be perceived at once that officers in the line
of the aimywcre prevented, by ihe terms of the
bill, from promotion to any situa'ions of rank. In
the organiza ion of the corps, is not the Executive
competent to judge of the menu and qualifications
of officers1 and is it necessary thus to pronde
agaiii't the appointment of officii* from the line oí
the army1 The Etecuhve tías taken an officer
from the staff to command the whole army in Flo-
rida, but ihe Executive is not to be leftatliberiy to
take an office! of rrnk, who has been fjgktmgjour
battles m tint sickly climate, and dtsheartenirg
warfare, and give him an appointment *sn the staff.
Other provisions, s í¡nl?r in character,Mr P said,
w'l! stnke the attei t on of any Senator who would
carefully lead the bill, and he predicted that the
construction which lit gave to the bill wottMke
verified by the fact that, in this reorganization, of
the various corps, not a single situation above the
rank of captain would be conferred tipen any
officer now m tb« ¡me of tr>fe army
He, Mr P. wasft#«ne of those w\0 believed
that aa efficient figgt offijeer -and ñ^xiag^fyet
