title has been extinguished, and"reserves this coun-
try for the northern Indians; and declares that
while we have reserved the country bordering on
Missouri and Arkansas foi the southern Indians,
no others shall be sent there, and that this country
described in the amendment is to be reserved for
the northern Iadians, when they can be removed
there. He hoped the Senate would see the pro-
priety of adopting this amendment, for it behooved
us, while we are providing for the security and
protection of these unfortunate people, not to lose
sight of the safety and welfare of our own
people
Mr NORVELL was glad to find that one por-
tion of the bill did not strike at the feelings of the
Southern Senators, and but for the State of Arkan-
sas, he would move to set apart all the territory
west of the Mississippi for the Indians, to constitute
a galaxy of Indian States
Mr Sevier warmly advocated the amendment
at some length, and
Alter some further remarks from Mr KING,
and from Messrs LINN and TIPTON in opposi-
tion to it,
The Senate adjourned over to Monday

THE LATE DUEL
The House then resumed the unfinished business,
being the report of the select committee appointed
to investigate into the causes which led to the death
of the late Hon Jovithan Cilley, the question
being on printing and postponing it till Monday
week
Mr ROBERTSON contained his remarks in op-
position to the coarse the committee had taken in di-
recting 01 recommending the action of the House,
insisting that the irregularity vitiated the whole
proceeding, and that the whole should be recommit-
ted He adverted to the publication of the report
in the Globe, which, if not a breach of the privi-
leges of the House, was, he said, mdelicate.and highly
reprehensiole, as was also the extract published in
that print from another paper, (the Philadelphia
Ledger, we believe,) appealing strongly to the pas-
sions of the House Mr R. went at large into
the argument to prove the irregularity of the pro-
ceedings of the committee, and reviewed the pre-
cedents cited by Mr. Toocey He disclaimed im-
puting any design or melive on the part of the
coBimitfte, m malting a labored commentary upon
the evidence, but spoke of its effect and tendency
as Corns injustice to the parties implicated, for it
prejudged them, and found a verdict of guilty, with-
out bringing forward a sulgle particle of justifica-
tion or extenuation.     Hence he objected to the
printing of the report, and also to its reception, for
though not a final sentence, yet it went to prescribe
a punishment, a torture upon the feelings, an out-
rage upon the rights, and a degradation upon the
character of individuals, and those individuals
members oí the House Mr R reprehended the
course of Mr Fairfield in originally bringing for-
ward the resolution, and said the only course the
House should now take would be to retrace their
steps, send back the report to the committee, with
instructions to undo all that had been done.
Mr STANLEY denied that the petitions sent to
the select committee were in the nature of instruc-
tions, and put the case of anti-slavery petitions be-
ing tent to a committee, praying for the abolition
of slave commerce between the States, the resolu-
tion of Mr Patton being rescinded, whether South-
ern members would approve a bill being reported
in consequence thereof. This he considered a eise
in point Mr S also replied to Mr Tipney and
Mr Toucey, and condemned the warm hngunge
of the latter, particularly in refemng to the deedm
sepulchral tones, as that of a min "embrumg his
hand in his brother's blood " This alone showed
that the gentleman hid ethimtpd a wainth of feel-
ing that mihtited igaitiM his impimalitv as a
judge The committee, Mr S eiesignatid a-, a
"parked jurt," \uth previously fomed opinion',
and they had no light to trj thigeiitlen en they hid
anatgned befoie them
Mr NAYLOR also opposed the motion of the
committee to print and postpone, and expiessed
himself in favor of tne motion indicated b> Mr
Adams to íecommit He was opposed to the
course recommended by the committee upon two
grounds first, that he believed the committee had
violated, he did not say intentionally, but still vio-
lated, the Constitution and laws ot the land, and,
secondly, they had done first wiongfully an act of
commission, and then secondly they had mmtted
to do what the rules of the II nise required the.}
should do These grounds he sustained b> insist-
ing that the lewlulion did not give the ermmitiee
the power to investigate the condua of members rf
the House, because they were not named therein,
and yet the committee had virtually tned and con-
demned those gentlemen, and, in the next phce,
their mode of proceeding conflicted with the oft-
cited rule of TcfTeison's Manual All that they
were authonzed to do was to report the fact to the
House that a member or members were implicated
Moreover, even m the course thev had pursued,
they hid only tried a portion of the memhers im-
plicated, for he would defy any man to discriminate
as to the guilt of the other parties who v> ere also
involved
As to the printing of the lepoit, it was now be-
come a matter of secondary importance, for, be-
fore it was known to the House, it was printed and
circulated from one end of the country to the
other He was not so much opposed to the print-
ing, however, as he was in fa\or of the motion of
Mr Adams to recommit, foi, as the report «as
already printed, the printing by the House could
have little effect one way or other
Mr BRONSON said, that if he did not know
the question now before the House, he should sup-
pose that the merits of the «hole question were
under discussion He thought the debaie had taken
altogether too wide a range He understood the
motion to be to postpone for a few days, and print
the report, and that the question would be divided,
so as to take the vote separately upon each pro
position In regard to the postponement, ne knew
of no very prominent objections, but he thought
the wishes of those persons involved should
be consulted, and he would be in a great mea-
sure willing to be governed by their desire
In regard to the question of printing, he xvas not
satisfied by the arguments of those who were
opposed to it He did not consider the question,
whether the members involved should beput on trial,
at all connected with the mere question of printing,
but it seemed that the whole matter had been
changed, and that thecommittee were now on trial
It was reduced to a question whether the report of
a committee, appointed by an order of the House,
should be thrown out of doors. He contended at
length that the true construction of the order com-
pelled the committee to reportj and that the re-
ference of me memorials strengthened that construc-
tion The House had full knowledge of these
facts, that certain members were implicated, not
only before the passage of the order, but also from
the memorials, and the House knew all the time
that the committee was engaged in an investigation
of the conduct of members of this House. It was,
therefore, unnecessary, and would have been a mere
matter of form,for the comimUee to have come in w ith
a report stating nothing m jre than a fact already
well known, and legally upon the records of the
House In fact, the committee was on trial, and
to suppress their report would be to cast censure
upon them, as it would be withholding from them
the orhmry courtesy due to a committee of the
House It was conceded that the printing could
now make no difference, for the report had been
printed, and was now circulated all over the coun-
try, but it was important that a cemmittee who
had done, as th y said, their duty faithfully, shoull
not be subjected to censure, and it was really a
question whether (1-p course if the comm ttte
should be sanctioned or condemned He contend-
ed, that the committee hnl kep' «■tn'-tl/ with n Ihe
line of their dutj, thit the} were bound to repoir
something, and had done no n ore tha i the or lei (t
the House d* mnded of ih m and he ws desir > is

Mi TOUCFY made a piopi moil to citcü an
omission in the journal, alluded toyesterdav, which
was not recened.
Some few remarks of a personal chaiacter passed
between Mr TOUCEY and Mr STANLEY
Mr WISE asked of the chairman whether anv
alteration, verbal or in substance, had been made
by tne other members of the committee in Mr Pot
terS absence, and s nee he had seen it
Mr TOUCEY replied that ihe committee tript on
Thnr«li}, and igieed upon snggestii.is to be em
bodied in the repoit and adjourned to meet < n Si
tuiday The report was shown to Mr Potter on
Friday night, as he wished to leave the city, dni he
approved of it fully On Satuiday morning ihe
committee met and discussed the report, and some
alterations, merely verbal, and not altering the
meaning, were then made
Mr WISE then remaiked that the fact wa, ad
muted That was a report nearly touching his
character, and chmaclei especnlly depended on i
woiíZ Pie would demand, tf at in a rpport affect-
ing his character, it should he in every word, 'etter
and m punctuation—for in punctuation there is sense
and sublimice—precisely as it was sanctioned In tne
committee, consisting of a mijenty of them, and
he protested against the alteration oí that re lort,
even to the cressing of a i, or the dotting of an i by
the other members, m the absence of Mi Potili,
and he wished to know if the Hous', under such
circumstance s. wou'd sanction the report?
Mr BOON said he had sat patiently and heard
such a general denunciation against the majority of
thiscommittee, that he become impatient Gentle-
men who had denounced the majority, all assumed
for themselves to be the exclusn e judges of the Con-
stitution and a little work called Jefferson s Ma-
nual. Why, Mr B under tood the Constitution to
be as broad as the Un ted States, and susceptible oí
as many constructions av. theie were individuals
within it capable or construing for themselves, and
he addressed himself more particularly to the gen-
tleman from Philadelphia, [Mr Natlob,] who was
so very explicit upon the subject of the Constitu
tion Mr B had no doubt that that gentleman
had fuliy satisfied himself that his construction ef
it was perfectly coi eect, and that the construction
by otners was worth nothing, but it worked no
conviction upon his [Mr B's] mind, foi he felt
himself left precisely where he was, w hen gentle-
man was done speaking, as he was when the gen-
tleman begin They might as well read lrom the
"Pottawattomie Psalm Book" to Mr B as to lead
from "Jefferson's Manual,'' when questions of
common sense and stern just ce came up for con
s deration Their hair-sphttmgs and cobweb dis-
tinctions should never direct him m his course
there nor elsewhere
When die proper time ai rived—he should not d jas
others had done, go into it now—but whpn the pro-
