THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 3,
In lieu of this I propose a uniform tax on all
tobacco and snuff of twenty-four or twenty
cents if the House so determine. This is said,
in mode of levying, to be satisfactory to the
manufacturers, and at a rate not perhaps all
that they should have, but almost all we can
at this time yield. I am not, myself, unwilling
to submit to the recommendation of the ma-
jority, and place the uniform tax on tobacco
at twenty cents.
There are under the present law eight dis-
tinct taxes on tobacco, snuff, and cigars. The
committee propose to reduce to six, as follows:
X. Manufactureis of cigars.
2. Dealers in leaf tobacco.'
3. Manufactured tobacco.
4. Manufacturers of tobacco.
6. The uniform tax of twenty cents.
6. Cigar tax of one half of one cent on each
cigar.
The amendments propose in lieu of all
these vexatious taxes-a simplification of two,
the one of twenty-four"cents or twenty cents
on tobacco of all kinds except cigars, and the
one of a half cent on cigars—a result much
desired by manufacturer and consumer.
There are also many annoyances connected
with the manufacture and sale of cigars, such
as requiring them to be packed m new boxes,
which is a destruction of every box when emp-
tied, and the requirement that retailers shall
sell from stamped boxes only, as well as others,
which might all be avoided by a provision that
the stamps should be affixed to each cigar in-
stead of the box, a provision which could be
readily enforced by authorizing any person
who finds an unstamped cigar to seize and con-
fiscate it.
There was realized last year from taxes on
tobacco, snuff, and cigars, $33,578,907 18.
The tax was levied as follows:
1. Dealers in leaf tobaeco, annual list.
2. Dealers in leaf tobacco, additional special tax,
monthly.
3. Dealers in tobacco, annual list.
4. Dealers in tobaeco. additional special tax,
monthly.
5. Manufacturers of tobacco, annual list.
6. Manufacturers of eigars, annual list.
7. Manufacturers of cigars, additional special tax,
monthlv.
a. Additional special tax on manufacturers of
tobaeco whenever his bond is increased.
The committee propose a uniform tax of
twenty cents, which is, upon an estimated aver-
age-
Say of 105,828,963 pounds, at 20 conts....$21,165,792 60
Cigars, &c  6,598,173 24
Total $27,763,965 84
Under the amendment I propose—
Say on 105,828,963 pounds, at 24 cents...$25,398,951 12
Cigars, 1,332,844,357, at one half cent  6,664,221 78
Total   $32,063,172 90
If at twenty cents, the revenue would be
about four million dollars less :
Last year's revenue:
On tobacco, snuff, and cigars 33,578,907 18
Committee's estimate, under their bill.. 27,763,965 84
Amendment proposed  32,063,172 90
FERMENTED LIQUORS.
The present tax on fermented liquorsis nom-
inally one dollar per barrel, but a discount
of 7J per cent, is allowed on stamps, which
makes the actual tax 92£ cents per barrel.
Taking the size of the packages allowed by
law, and this iavolves a fraction of a cent in
t.he tax on each, and the computation of the
tax in brewers, assessors, collectors, and the
office accounts is in consequence much compli-
cated. The barrel is 92J cents ; half barrel,
46J cents'; quarter barrel, 23J cents: sixths,
16& cents; eighths, 11& cents. Taking the
tax at. 96 cents per barrel without discount,and
the whole fractional complication is abolished,
and a single stamp tax at this rate will yield
more than is at present realized from both
stamps and speeial taxes. The amount col-
lected last year from beer stamps was$7,159,-
740 20 ; representing at 92J cents per barrel,
7,740,260 barrels, with the tax at 96 cents,
this would yield $7,430,657 60, a little more
than was received from this source the last
year including the special taxes.
Amendment proposed, to wit, 96 cents per
barrel, say on 7,740,259 barrels at 96 cents,
would realize $7,430,658 64, which would
prove rather an increase than a decrease.
Recapitulation under the proposed amend-
ment :
Distilled spirits $42,254,664 90
Tobacco, snuff, and cigars  32,063,172 90
i'ermented liauors  7,430,658 54
81,748,506 44
All realized by agency of stamps, whioh
would render assessors, assistants,
ancl their clerks unnecessary.
If we include taxes on banks, to be col-
lected through the Currency Bureau,
(the tax upon private bankers I would
relinquish,) estimate  3,000,000 00
84,748,506 44
If tobacco is left at twenty cents it
involves a redaction of, say  4,000,000 00
Leaving the net revenue at $80,748,506 44
The tax upon banks and bankers I would
combine, as far as the banks are concerned,
and authorize the payment of the same directly'
by the banks to the Treasury, giving the Comp-
troller of the Currency full power to see that
the payment of the same is regularly and cor-
rectly made under the terms of the existing
law. The tax upon private bankers I would
abolish, m like manner as I would abolish the
tax on gas, amounting to $2,573,122,92, and
on friction matches, amounting to about two
million three huruti ed thousand dollars.
It is interesting to examine what the taxes
are which the committee propose to retain,
which require the employment of assessors,
their assistants, and what will be realized
therefrom. As far as I am able to ascertain
it would be as follows :
Distilled spirits by assessment  $6,767,733 46
Manufacturers of cigars  142,192 40
Dealers in leaf tobaeco    221.661 98
Dealers in manutactured tobaeco  970,017 96
Manufacturers of tobacco  20,174 93
Brewers'special tax   229,761 62
Banks and bankers' tax  3,644,241 53
Total $11,995,783 88
which will constitute the entire employment
necessary for the two thousand assessors, as-
sessors' clerks, and assistant assessors, whose
salary and expenses amount to about $3,500,-
000 the last fiscal year, and iS likely to be the
same this year under the committee's bill.
My proposition is to abolish all internal
revenue taxes except upon distilled spirits,
tobacco and snuff, cigars and fermented
liquors, and to make these stamp taxes re-
quiring no assessment, thus doing away with
the necessity of keeping up the army of as-
sessors, their clerks, and assistant assessors,
at the yearly cost of over $3,500,000, and also
to abolish those nondescript officers called
supervisors, who, being nominated by the Com-
missioner of Internal lievenue, are confirmed
by the Secretary, and yet are authorized by
law to suspend from office officers appointed
by the President and confirmed by the Sen-
ate, the latter at a cost to the Government of
$181,677 68 peryear, ofwhich about one third,
or $67,460 66, is salary, and two thirds, or
$114,217 02, is clerk hire and expenses.
The number of officers who will be disposed
of is about as follows :
Assessors a little less than the number of members
of the House of Representatives, say  225
Assessors' clerks, (a moderate estimate,) say... 500
Assistant assessors about  1,400
Supervisors  25
Supervisors'clerks, say  SO
Total by direct action  2,180
Reduction of expense by above :
Assessors, assistant assessors, and ex-
penses  - $3,541,932 12
Supervisors and expenses  181,6/7 68
$3,723,609 80
Should the recommendations I make be in-
grafted on the law, as sooner or later they
will and must be, then I would suggest a fur-
ther amendment, looking directly to the trans-
fer of all the duties of the Commissioner of the
lievenue from the said officer to what I would
hereafter call the commissioner of customs
and internal revenue, dispensing altogether
with the officer now known as the Commis-
sioner of Internal lievenue, in some such lan-
guage as follows: That the office or bureau of
internal revenue shall be, and is hereby, abol-
ished, and all the powers, authority, and
duties pertaining to the office of Commissioner
of Internal Revenue are hereby transferred to
and vested in the Commissioner of Customs,
who shall hereafter be styled commissioner
of customs and revenue, and shall have charge
and direction of all papers, books, records,
and business pertaining to the internal reve-
nue, under the direction of the Secretary of
the Treasury. And the Secretary of the
Treasury shall transfer to the office of customs
and revenue so many of the clerks now em-
ployed in the office of internal revenue as the
necessities of the service may demand.
The figures which 1 have presented and
made comparison of are not only interesting
but instructive, and show clearly that the in-
ternal taxes can be at once reduced to $80,000,-
000, without embarrassment to the Govern-
ment and with great relief to the people.
Under such circumstances we, in my judgment,
criminally fail in our duty if we continue them
longer. I may as a general proposition declare
that every dollar raised by internal taxation
can be placed to the payment of the principal
of the public debt, the receipts from other
sources being equal to the sum required to pay
the interest on that debt and the current
expenses of maintaining the Government if
economically administered.
There is one moie subject to which I wish
to direct the attention of the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, the members
of the House generally, and the country, which
I may characterize as the discrepancies in the
accounts of the Treasury Department as to the
receipts of public money into the Treasury
during the nine years last past, from June 30,
1863, to June 30, 1871, inclusive:
Collections of internal revenue as stated in the official reports of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the Fifth Auditor, from September 1,1862,
to July 1, 1871.
