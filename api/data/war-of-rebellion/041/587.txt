Lieutenant FRENCH,

Aide-de-Camp:

Go down in a special train to Colonel Cahill. Tell him he must go to the support of Stickney; the I have sent the trains down to be placed at his disposal, so that, if driven back, he can easily retire.

Lieutenant-Colonel STICKNEY:

If you are compelled to withdraw from La Fourche, do you propose to do so by the railroad cars or by the road? If by the cars, I must have them organized for you.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Colonel Cahill has made a junction with Colonel Stickney at La Fourche. The enemy were repulsed by Stickney before the junction.

If the attempt to move toward Brashear, I will order them to be attacked in the rear, so that I have no doubt we can keep them from Brashear long enough to enable a gunboat to get there, and if in the meantime Port Hudson falls, we will bag them or drive them into the lake.

Very respectfully, yours,

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
