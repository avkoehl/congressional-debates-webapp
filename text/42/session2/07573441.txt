tributaries, and carrying passengers, when on a pas-
sage, shall, between sunset and sunrise, keep a
watchman, other than the officers on duty, iu each
of the cabins and on each deck, excepting only the
hurricane deck, to guard against fire or other dan-
gers, and to give alarm in case of accident or disas-

ers, when on a voyage and carrying passengers, shall
have one watchman, or raore, if deemed necessary
fcy the supervising inspectors, on duty at all times
during the night, in each cabin and in the steerage.
And all steamers navigating the waters flowing into
the Gulf of Mexico, and their tributaries, and carry-
ing passengers, when on passage, shall have on duty,
between sunset and sunrise, two watchmen, whose
places of duty shall be designated by the officers in
charge of the steamer: Provided, That ferry-boats
on such waters carrying passengers shall be required
to have but one watchman. And for every neglect
to comply with the requirements of this section the
license of the officer in charge of the vessel for tho
time being shall be revoked; and if any owner of
such vessel shall neglect or refuse to furnish the
reouisite number of men to keep watch, as herein

each deck to guard against fire or other dangers,
and to give alarm in ease of aceidentor disaster; and
for every neglect of this duty the license of the officer

voked ; and the board of supervising inspectors may
require every such steamer, and also steamers carry-
ing freight, to be provided with such number and
kind of good and efficient portable fire-extinguish-
ers as in the judgment of the board may bo necessary
to protect them from fire when such steamers are
moored or lying at a wharf, without steam to work
the pumps; and if any owner of such vessel shall
neglect or refuse to furnish the requisite number of
men necessary to keep watch as herein required, he
shall be fined $1,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to strike out the
seventh section in the following words:
That every steamer (except ferry-boats and canal-
boats, which shall be equipped with boats as here-
inafter provided) navigating rivers only shall have

urement, shall have one metallic life-boat, in
all respects a good, substantial, and safe sea-boat,
with life-lines and detaching-hooks attached,

as to be at all times ready for immediate use;
and every such vessel of four hundred tons, and not
exceeding eight hundred tons, shall, m addition
to said working boat, have three boats, two of
which shall be metallic lite-boats; and every such
vessel exceeding eight hundred tons, and not exceed-
ing one thousand lour hundied tons, shall,m addi-
tion to said woiking boat, have four boats, two of

vessel of more than two thousand tons, and not ex-
ceeding two thousand eight hundred tons, shall,
in addition to said working boat, hove six boats,
three of which shall be metallic life-boats; and
every such vessel exceeding two thousand eight hun-
dred tons, in addition to said working boat, have
eight boats, fourof which shall bo metallic life-boats ;
and the length of each of such boats, except the
woiking boat, shall not be less than one tenth the
vessel's length on deck, (but in 110 case shall such
boat or boats be less than twelvfi feet in length,)
and shall be otherwise properly proportioned and
well and substantially constructed. Of the boats
required, at least one hall 1 ho number shall be hung

their total capacity shall not be less thun herein
required. All steam ferry-boats of over finy tons,
and not exceeding three hundred tons, shall carry

than sixteen feet in length and so equipped, one
ot which shall be a metallio life-boat, and one
of which shall be a working-boat: Provided* That
where, from tho character of the navigation or other
cause, m the opinion of the inspeotors appointed
under the provisions of this act. a part of the metal-
lic life-boats may be dispensed with, they may
exempt any such steamer from carrying tho same,
a-nd substitute therefor woodon boats, metallio or
other rafts. And every steamer, except ferry-boats
which are hereinbefore provided for, navigating
tbo waters flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, shall bo
equipped with one good yawl-boat, at least one

equivalent in capacity; but in no case shall said
yawl be less than eighteen feet in length, and of
proportionate depth and width for effective useful-
ness, provided with oars and life-lines, and one
metallio life-boat at least one tenth tho length of

ner so as to be brought into immediate uso in
case of accident: Provided, That where the ehai-
acter of the navigation u such that, m the opin-
ion of the supervising inspector the metallic lile-
boatscan be dispensed with, he is hereby author-
ized to exempt any such steamer from carrying tho
same, or may require a substitute tneicfor, at his
discretion; and eveiysteamer navigating the ocean,
or any lake, bay, or sound of the United States, shalJ
be provided with such numbers of life-boats, floats,
rafts, and life-preservers, also drags when necessaiy,
as will best secure tho satety of all persons on board
such vessel in case of disaster; and every sea-going
vessel carrying passengers, and every such vessel
navigating any of the northern or northwestern
lakes, shall have the life-boats requited bylaw, pio-
vided with suitable boat-disengaging apparatus, so
arranged as to allow such boats to be safely launch-
ed while such vessels are under speed or otherwise,
and so as to allow such disengaging apparatus to be
operated by one person, disengaging both ends of
the boat simultaneously from the tackles by which
they may be lowered to the water, And it shall be
the duty of the board of supervising inspectors to
fix and determine, by their rules and regulations,
thekindoflife-boats,floats,raJts, life-preservers, and
drags that shall be used onsuch vessels, and silso the
kind and capacity of pumps or other appliances tor
freeing the steamer from water in ca^c of heavy
leakage, the capacity of said pumps or appliances
being suited to tho navigation in which the steamer
is employed ; and if the owners ot any such steameis
neglect or refuse to provide such drags, lite-boats,
floats, rafts, life-preservers, pumps, or appliances,
as shall be required by the board of supervising
