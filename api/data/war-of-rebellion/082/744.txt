region it might serve as a nucleus to those citizens capable of bearing arms. General Pegram is nearly well, and could he take his brigade to the vicinity for a time he might increase its force (about 450) and organize some resistance to the enemy. I was told at the War Department that this matter rests with General Lee.

Respectfully forwarded to the honorable Secretary of War.

It is impossible to detach troops from this army to defend the locality mentioned. A small force sent there would only attract the efforts of the enemy to capture if, and would be very much exposed. If the people will do nothing to defend themselves against such outrages I can see no remedy for them. I think arms should be furnished them, and, if practicable, some officer sent there to aid in organizing them. They could easily repel such marauding parties if they would exert themselves.

R. E. LEE,

General.
