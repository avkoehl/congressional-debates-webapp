HEADQUARTERS,Clark's, May 29, 1864-6.30 p. m.

General ANDERSON:

GENERAL: General Early now reports that he does not think that the force which was advancing on him was infantry. General Lee desires you to have your troops ready to be moved either way and to send a staff officer to General Early and one to General Hill to be well acquainted with the condition of things in front of each, and then to be guided by your judgment in moving to thee support of the point where you may be required. General Hill is on the left of General Breckinridge covering the point where the road from Shady Grove Church to Hanover Court-House crosses the Totopotomoy along the creek. General Lee says he will not be able to see you to-night but will to-morrow.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Clark's, May 29, 1864-6.40 p. m.

General ANDERSON:

GENERAL: There is a gap reported between Breckinridge's right and Early's left. The country is regarded as impracticable; the creek there is difficult of passage, yet you had better be prepared to ford it. Send forward an officer to acquaint yourself with the position, &amp;c.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. ARTILLERY, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 29, 1864.

Brigadier General W. H. PENDLETON,

Commanding Artillery:

GENERAL: I have this morning inspected the Stuard Horse Artillery and find the command in tolerably efficient condition. The fresh horses (100) have not yet been supplied by Colonel Corley, and are greatly needed. Those now in the batteries are much worn down and many of them unfit for service. They are properly groomed and cared for, grazed, and receive about 8 pounds corn. The caissons are well supplied with ammunition. The axle of a Napoleon gun in McGregor's battery is broken, and the piece has been sent to Richmond for repair. In the action yesterday 1 man was killed and 1 wounded, and 2 horses disabled. Major Chew is very anxious to effect the transfer to his battalion of the battery of horse artillery in General Breckinridge's command. He urges that General B. has now two battalions of mounted artillery, and that the horse artillery would be of more service in the cavalry, and would give two batteries to each division. Major Chew is desirous that you will direct the transfer. I shall make every exertion this morning to procure the fresh horses for the battalion.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. ESTEN COOKE,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
