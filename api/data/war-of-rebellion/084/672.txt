Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Cottonwood Springs:

The following just received:

The state just in to Atchison brings news of Indians murdering people on Little Blue. Can troops from Fort Kearny move down on them?

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

I have replied to General Curtis that we have but one mounted company at Kearny, and Indians all along our line.

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OMAHA, August 12, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

General Mitchell is out west at Cottonwood Springs, I think. I have sent your dispatch to him there. There is but one mounted company at Kearny, and the Indians are along our line from Kearny to South Pass.

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OMAHA, August 12, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Cottonwood Springs:

I have given transportation for Territorial arms to Fort Kearny. The Governor now wants transportation to Grand Island and Columbus, but I do not like to trust our trains without escort or to withdraw troops from any point for escort without your knowledge. Shall I give transportation in this case and without escort? I shall send subsistence to-day to the companies at Nebraska City, if they are to move to the Blue direct from there, and direct them to communicate with Fort Kearny. I will endeavor to push things along and do the best I can, but like as frequent and full directions from you as possible, so that I may work understandingly and carry out your views. General Curtis was at Saint Joseph yesterday on his way here.

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OMAHA, August 12, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Cottonwood Springs:

The Governor has called out twelve companies militia. There are not enough horse equipments at Leavenworth to mount the First Nebraska if they remain here. Colonel Livingston thinks they can be obtained more quickly from Saint Louis. Shall I forward his requisition to General Curtis, with request that it be forwarded to Saint Louis, with explanation of the emergency?

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
