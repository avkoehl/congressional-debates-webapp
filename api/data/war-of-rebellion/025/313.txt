[R. M. SAWYER,]

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BETHEL, [November 1, 1862].

General SULLIVAN:

Lieutenant-Colonel Sanford, with Forty-eighth Illinois, now out on reconnaissance toward Henderson, reports that rebel cavalry, 300 strong, left Henderson and went toward mouth of Duck River. I have no cavalry that can go after them; only one cavalry company here. Other reports say the enemy is in greater force. I doubt it. My scouts are well out toward the river east. Will advise you of anything important if can do so.

I. N. HAYNIE,

Colonel.

JACKSON, November 1, 1862.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding District of Jackson:

GENERAL: You will have four regiments of infantry ready to move by rail to Bolivar on to-morrow, moving under the command of Brigadier General John A. Logan, who on his arrival at that place will assume command of the division lately commanded by Brigadier-General Ross, including the four regiments sent from this place.

By command of Major General U. S. Grant:

W. R. ROWLEY,

Aide-de-Camp.

BOLIVAR, November 1, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Colonel Leggett has just received the following dispatch:

GRAND JUNCTION.

Colonel LEGGETT:

Large force of infantry and cavalry here. They will attack you; cavalry now moving. I saw you last Tuesday. Can't get to Bolivar.

The dispatch was brought in by a negro about half an hour ago, and Colonel Leggett thinks it is from a man who is perfectly reliable. I shall immediately send four companies of cavalry down on the road to reconnoiter. My patrols that went out this morning have not reported yet.

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.
