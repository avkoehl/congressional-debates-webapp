Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,Secretary of War:

I have received your dispatch to Mr. Dana of the 10th instant, and desire to return to the President and yourself my most grateful thanks. The uniform kindness I have ever received from both of you led me to feel confident no mere report to my discredit world be accepted by either of you without the strongest evidence to sustain it. The expression of your continued confidence is most gratifying, and I beg to assure you it shall be my earnest endeavor to prove myself worthy of your opinion in any position it should be should the public interests require me to serve.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

In looking over the maps it appears to be highly probable that a road can be found from D. Higgins' of W. Anderson's across to Ratcliffe's old tavern, which would give a route of the your corps out of reach of shelling from the south bank of the Chickahominy. This would cross the railroad just above the mill-pond near Dispatch Station. This route would run from Miss Wicker's to Martin's Hollins', Madison's, Tucker's, p. Higgin's, D. Higgin's, W. Anderson's, Ratcliffe's old tavern, &amp;c.
