A. J. MACKAY,

Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Cumberland.

MAJOR: Your communication of the 24th directing me to cross was received last night after dark. I went down this morning early to see Colonel Mackay about boats, and he informed me that he could not put anybody across now and that all the boats and barges were being loaded with the stores at Eastport, part of them being submerged already and the river still rising rapidly.
