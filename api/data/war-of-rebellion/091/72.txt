as to enable you to saddle up in time. Keep up your supplies from Kearnsville, and in case you are driven from your position fall back to Kearnesville, keeping this brigade instantly notified of your movements. Do not invite attack or offer battle by sending out large parties. Recall the regiment sent out and substitute in place small patrols which can go quickly and far to examine the roads. Keep a mobile picket in the vicinity of North Mountain. The object is rest and recuperation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
