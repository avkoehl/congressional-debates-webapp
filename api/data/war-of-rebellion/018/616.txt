night. Sumner arrives in the morning. I am forwarding ample supplies of everything except forage, for which I have called on Washington. Whatever occurs, hold out until I arrive.

General BURNSIDE:

Have arrived, and all my corps will be here by 12 to-morrow. Debarking is slow, and if I can expedite matters after seeing Captain Biggs shall land and march up the most of the artillery. Schooners coming have scarcely grain and hay sufficient to last to this place. Have you any instructions?

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

AQUIA CREEK.

(Received August 21, 1862.)

General BURNSIDE:

I will be up to-night. I wish to tell you of many things by which you can be benefitted. In the mean time if you can do anything to hasten up the ammunition of my corps and the reserve artillery you will do a good thing. It was packed on schooners when I left. Two light-horse batteries are at Yorktown belonging to reserve artillery. They are Robertson's and Benson's, and if not checked will go to Alexandria with Heintzelman. Have just found some of Reynolds' troops, which I will get off.

Major-General.

(Received August 21, 1862.)

General BURNSIDE:

All the infantry will embark before night, and I expect to send them up by rail. Wagons are now going for the troops to which they belong. Six or seven batteries are afloat, and will commence disembarking in an hour and on the road by morning. I think it best to stay an hour or so longer. I am the only officer of rank here, and I find essential the presence of one who has control over different divisions. Will be at your place about dark, and want the shady side of a tree or house to-night.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

AQUIA,

General MCCLELLAN, Fort Monroe:

Arrived at 11 a. m. All my infantry will debark before dark, and all the artillery now here, six batteries, before daybreak. Require wagons and ambulances here.
