Brigadier-General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report that it is reported by the officer commanding the pickets, the shells thrown from the fort this morning fell into the rebel camps and broke them up. Although the report to me is not strictly official, I have no doubt that general confusion was produced in their camp, and therefore respectfully suggest that Colonel Minty be sent out on a reconnaissance in that direction to ascertain the true state of affairs.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
