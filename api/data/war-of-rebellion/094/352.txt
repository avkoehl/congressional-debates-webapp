HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISS.,Five Miles Southwest of Pulaski, on Lamb's Ferry Road,

December 25, 1864-6 p.m.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Harrison's brigade came up with the enemy's infantry, strongly posted in rail breast-works, and after some sharp skirmishing was driven back, losing one gun. The ground was repossessed in ten minutes, but the gun was carried off; forty or fifty prisoners were captured march again, and prisoners say they are ordered to go ahead until they get across the river. My advance is two miles beyond here. Two locomotives down below Pulaski were saved from burning by one of Hatch's regiments. The rebel force is eight brigades, o f 500 or 600 picked men each. The country is a very broken in poor one. My horses are suffering for forage, and my men are getting short of rations, though I will push on again early in the morning in hopes of getting back the lost gun and one or two besides. Is there any news from Sherman?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
