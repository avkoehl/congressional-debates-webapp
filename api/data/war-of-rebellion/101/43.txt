No. 3. Report of Lieutenant Albert Walter, Second Colorado Cavalry. * JUNCTION, COLO. TER., February 1, 1865.

SIR: I have the honor to addressing the colonel commanding district a report of my march from Denver to Julesburg and from there back to the Junction:

The detachment started from Denver the 14th of January, in compliance with Special Orders, No. 8, extract 7, headquarters Denver, Colo. Ter., January 9, 1865, having an advance guard, rear guard, and flankers in proportion to the strength of my command. The 18th of January, in the forenoon, about eight miles south of the Junction, my scouts discovered a party of ten Indians. My scouts gave them chase, but the Indians ran away with great speed. On the morning of the 19th, at Morrison's ranch, four miles of the Junction, between 2 and 3 o'clock, my picket fired at the approaching Indians. In less than three minutes my command had their horses saddled, bridled, and completely under arms, formed a line of skirmishers (as the moon was rising) in front of the camp, advancing carefully in search of the Indians, having my reserve at the proper distance, but the Indians disappeared as fast as they came. The following night we camped near Godfrey's ranch, thirty-three miles east of the Junction. The same game was repeated by the Indians, but the same result. After that I was not molested by them at night. I arrived safe with the train the 22nd day of January at Julesburg. The 23rd I received a telegram dated January 21, 1865, from headquarters, Denver, Colo. Ter., to escort an ox train to Living Spring. I left Julesburg the 24th of January to comply with said telegram, and proceeded to Gillett's ranch, nine miles west of Julesburg, where I found the owner of the train. His cattle were captured two days before by the Indians. Immediately after my arrival I sent a party after them with one guide, with orders to return before dark in camp and not to stray away from each other. Five returned with the guide, bringing twenty-two head of stock with them; three of my men were missing. Early in the morning of the following day I sent out another party, with two guides, in search of the three missing. After a careful search during that day returned without them. The names of the missing men are Peter Brine, Frank. Thompson, and Ed. Kelso. The owner of the train could not start from there. The 26th of January I marched to Silver Springs. During that day the Indians were in sight on both sides of the river and in my rear, keeping a respectful distance. The 27th I reached Valley Station. The following day I left Valley Station. After twelve miles' marching I was overtaken by an expressman of Lieutenant Kennedy's command, with the news that he was fighting with 200 Indians and wanted assistance. I turned my command about and in one hour and forty minutes I arrived at Valley Station, finding that the fight had ceased, the Indians having taken 500 to 600 head of cattle with them. I detailed twenty of my men and Lieutenant Kennedy with the same number of his command. Started at 3 p. m. in pursuit of the Indians in direct northerly direction. At 10 o'clock at night we came in sight of some stock. We concluded to remain at that place during the night. At daybreak we continued our march. At sunrise we discovered the Indians moving out of their camp, over 100 in number. The Indians
