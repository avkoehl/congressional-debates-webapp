The report of Colonel Wise, who is in charge of this branch of the Quartermaster-General's Office, contains some important observations upon the construction and management of steam ocean transports.

At the beginning of the war the department was imposed upon. Officers and agents had little experience, and inferior vessels were sometimes chartered, and excessive prices were paid for steamers chartered from the regular trade, not them entirely and hopelessly broken up by the war.
