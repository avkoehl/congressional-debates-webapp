that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury except by spe
cific appropriation by law The House, however, regardless of
this principle of theConstitution,hdd undertaken, on its own re
sponsibility, by simple resolution, to abstract money from the
Treasury They had no more right to apply the moneys ap
propnated for the contingent expenses of the House to the pur
chase of books for themselves, than by simple resolution to iake
money from the Tteasury for any other purpose The act was
void, and should not be sanctioned by his vote id any form
The question was taken on Mr Archer's amendment, and
it was adopted
Mr WOODBURY then moved the following amendment
Insert,( Provided, That no pait of this or any other appropna
Uon, be paid for the pinchase het eafter of books to be distributed
among members of Congress without the previous sanction of
an express law for that purpose, nor shall any books so puiehas
ed hereafter be paid for, except frjm a specific appropriation,
enumerating the books and their cost"
Mr EVANS did not know that he understood the amendment
distinctly, but he doubted veiy touch if there wais nota great
deal of phraseology m it which could not be properly ¡ntro
ducedin an appiopnation bill He did not approve of in tro
during legislation m cuch a bill
Mr HUNTINGTON asked that the amendment be read
again
It was read accordingly
Mr EVANo «aid he was ready for the question.
Mr WOODBURY again explained the object ¡of the amend
ment tobe merely to pievent,m future, appropnations notau
thonzed by previous laws
Mr CALHOUN regarded the resolution of the other House
as illegal and unconstitut onal, and the conduct of the Cleik as
unjustifiable in purchasing more books than authorized and
yet the Senate found itself in a condition that the payment
should be made He wished to see an end put to this practice,
and therefore hoped the amendment would be adopted
Mr ARCHER, made a few observations m favor of in ro
ducmg this item in a special bill for that purpose
The yeas and nays were called for and ordered
The question was then taken and resulted—yeas 17, r>ays 18,

a permanent diplomatic agent abroad like on*1 to Cenual
America, n^med in that lepo t, appointed since the 4th of
Match, 1841, and not nominated to the Senate yet, should not

The object of the limitation was to have all these regulated

Mr PRCSION said it was necc3oaiy to put some rcsti unt

He wished a resdlutiufi had i ailed fur thr practice of the Ihni,

despatches, instead of the former practice of sendirg special
agents on every occasion which íequired despatches He
should be unwilling to place any inconvenient restrictions on
the contingent fund
Mr bEVIER moved an adjournment, ^vhich was negatived—

Mr CALHOLN moved an adjournment—yea? 10, nivs 18
Mr TAPPAN contended that «ome restriction ueht to be

He alluded paiticularlv to one person sent to Central Ameuca
Mr WOODBUItY aleo pomte-1 out mííanccsof the kind He
read the following li t from the menage of the President of the
United States, communicating a repoit from the ¡secretaiy of

the number and names of the agents employed by that depart
ment without express- pi ovision of law, namely 1st Agents
for receiving and transmitting despatches to and from the de
partment and to and fium the seveiril legations and consulates
of the United States
Nathaniel Green, it I íverpool compen°atioa S'iOt) peí an

Alanson Tucker, |r , at Boston, compensation $800 per annuir,
appointed 24th A.pnl, lfiil
The appointment to f entra! America was William S3 Mur
phy, employed as a special agent to Central America etnee the
28th day of July, 1841 He is to have the usual allowance m
such cases—eight dollars per day, and hisnecessary travelling
expenses, payable out of the appropriation for the contingent
expenses of intercourse with foreign nations, by authority of
the President by whom he was appointed
Mr CRITTENDEN did not know whether there was any
authority for sending out ministers to such, places as Central
America, but ll there was law for sending Mr Stevens there,
under the late Administration, to hunt for a Government, there
was as much law under the present Administration for sending
the individual alluded to
Mr WOODBURY asked if the Senator from Kentucky dü
not know that Mr Stevens was sent out to exchange theraufi
cations of ati^aty made by a former Charge d'Affaiies
Mr CRITTENDEN did not know any thing about it, but saw,
by Mr Stevens's work, that he was Minister to Central Amen
ca, and could not find the Government he was sent to
Mr WRIGHT di 1 not conceive the present Administration
was under any special obligation to adopt the abuses of the late
Admmis ration indeed it was pledged toieform ihose abuses
He wouid re-id a list of new agencies, appointed by this Admin
letration, to show the sincerity of the reform He read a list
showing that agents for despatches have been established at
JNew York, Boston, and Liverpool He ihen read the list of
ascents elsewhere, as well as newly appointed agents Two
cases formerly existed, and three new ontc were appointed, with
a travelling agent in Central America, at eight dollars a day, and
travellifi^ charges
The section and amendment weie then read
Mr EVANS oo er -d that the intercourse between this
country and Europe nad been so much facilitated of late years,
that the Government has found it expedient to have its de
spritches forwarded with ismuch^peed as ihe letters of private
individuals He supposed these agents would pio\e the most
economical plan of forwarding despatches
Mr WOODBURY took up Mr Clay's series of reform and
retrenchment lesolutions, and read from it the 9th, which had
been adopted by the Senate ab follows
" Resolved, That thr diplomatic relations of the United
States with foreign poweis have betn unnecessarily extended
during the last twelve yeais, and ought to be reduced '*
He asked ihe Stnator from Maine wh it was the u&ti of pass
mg such resolution , and ihe i making i mockery of them, hy

Mr WRIGHT and Mr WOODBUR1 made a few eiplan

The motion of Mr EiFitETihavingbeen agiee Ho, the House
resolved itself into Cun mittte of the W hole on Ihe state ol the
Union (Mr ALLE1* of Maine in the chair ) and fesumed the
consideration of the bill for the apportionment of Represent
atives anion  the several States, according to the sixth census
When the committee rose last evening, the state of the ques
tion was as follows
Mi Haisted fiom thr Commttee of Elections had moved
to amend the bill by addms the fol owing a   eciion2
And be it further enarled That t arh State bhall he divided,
by the J e°islatuie thei^of mo as inai y districts composed of
contigtl nis. terntoiy as shall be equal to th*1 ntimbei of Repre
sentslivesto which said ^ ate mav be entitled m fhe House of
Repiesentatlves ol the ( ongiesso the United states and that
each of the said dlstl lets shall elect one Rep esentative
To which amendment Mi Caiipbeii, of «outh Carolina had
moved the following amendment
That in every case where a State is entitled to more than one
Representative, the number to which each State shall be enti
tied under this apportionment shall be elected by districts com-
posed of contiguous territory, equal in number to the number of
Representatives to which said State may be entitled, no one d«-
trict electing more thaivone Repi esentative
Which said amendment Mr Halstkd had, on behalf of the
Committee of Elections, (as the reporter understood,) accepted
as a modification of the amendment reported from that com-
mittee
Mr CoLamiT had then moved to amend the amendment, by
excepting from the operation thereof Ihe State of Georgia.
And the question pending was on the amendment to th«
amendment
Mr FERRIS, after a recapitulation of the grounds gone
over by him yesteiday before yielding'to a motion for adjourn-
ment, said that he entertained no tears oí a combination of the
larger to oppressandoverwhelm the smaller States. E?en if
such a purposecould be cherished, the Constitution had pro-
vided a sufficient check, by gmr g the States equal votes in the
other end of the Capitol there, the population of a State might:
be but one twenty filth ofthat of another S,ate, (as was thecaee
in regard tosome oft e smaller States,) but her voice told equal-
ly, m thepassageofall laws with that of her larger neighbor If
the object of this amendment was to r duce the larger States, la
the House ofRepresentatives, to an equality with the smal!err
the purpose was a bad one, and involved a reflection on the
wisdom of the Constitution, which had provided for an equality
of State representation elsewhere, but had intended that, in this
body, populanepiesentation should be secured Should such.
a purpose be consummated, its only effect would be to spread
the seeds of dissatisfaction among the great States, and must
contain the germe of its own ultimate defeat The larger State 
had adopted the district system Irom motives partly oí conve-
nience and par.Iy of policy perhaps that the voice of minori-
ties might have its due weight and importance—perhaps thatr
sectional interests might all be heard Mr F said that, in th&
mam, lieapproved of the district system, but, if the power of
Congress should be brought upon his own State to deprive her
of that weightto whKh her amount of population entitled her*
on this floor he should feel it his duty to sustain her rights ha
should leel bound as a citizen and Representative of the Stat 
of New York to insist that her citizens should enjoy equal
i ights with the cit zeoe of every other State—no more and no*
less she chimed no moie, she wouldbecontentwithnoless.
She had submitted, without complaining, to the constitutional
check imposed upon hei power by the constitution cf the Sen-
ale and should sht, ever be fiund conspiung to oppress her
weaker associates that check would be interposed and effect-
ually em ployed agair st her
Mr F declined gnmg fnitner into the relative mentsof ther
two systems of e'ection If Congress had power to enforce the
one upon the State* it had power to enforce the other It wast
dangejrous to evoke such afower from its latent tate though,
it might suit the purposes of one parly to day, it could be em-
ployed with equal caseto secure the ends of the opposite party
to morrow and it was peculiarly so <ia it rested on construction,
merely
This brought Mr T to the constitutional question, the dis-
cussion of which formed the bodv of his speech He said he
had looked into the language of the Constitution for the exist-
ence ol a power to disti ict the á att s and lie could find no such;
powei there no plain man reading the 4th article of that in*
stiument with an unbiassed mind, could, h«-should suppose, sea
any thing like it every such man woul I take the article to refec
to the mode of performing the act itself of electing Representa-
tives and to this alone
Theie weie two rules which ¡rovemed him in the mterjireta-
tioti of the Constitution 1 he fiist was to take the words in their
oidmary acceptation, as they were nsed in common parlance
by those who understood the English language, thesecond was,
so to interpret its language that every word employed should
have a mtanmg
Mr F sat out by taking a distinction between the manner of
lepresentingthehtalcsof ihellnionm < ingress, and the man-
ner ol choosing iheir Representatives He thought the distinc-
tion ¿sound one ami we 1 founded 1 'ie mode of lepresenting-

progress of this particul ir clause as it was originally proposed

been prop sed that the General Government should have a
