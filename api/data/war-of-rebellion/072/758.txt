Reports of Colonel Moses B. Walker, Thirty-first Ohio Infantry, commanding First Brigade.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, THIRD DIV., 14TH ARMY CORPS,Utoy Creek, Ga., August 20, 1864.

MAJOR: Early on the morning of the 7th of May this brigade, then commanded by Brigadier General John B. Turchin, broke up camp at Ringgold, Ga., and after a hard day's march encamped near Tunnell Hill, Ga., throwing out a picket guard of one regiment, the Thirty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry. On the 8th we marched to a position opposite Buzzard Roost Gap. On the 9th, 10th, and 11th the brigade remained in camp in line of battle. On the 12th marched through Snake Creek Gap to a position two miles east, and occupied works previously built by the Army of the Tennessee. On the 13th the brigade moved into position four miles from Resaca.

On the morning of the 14th the brigade was moved to a position on the left of the division, connecting on its left with the right of the Army of the Ohio. Skirmishers were immediately thrown out, who engaged the enemy's skirmishers about 200 yards in advance of our line of battle, driving them back to the hills opposite our front, about three-fourths of a mile, the main line advancing at the same time, until the skirmishers had ascended the first line of hills. Here the firing on the skirmish line became brisk and well sustained, our line holding its position, but being unable to advance, owing to the superior strength of the enemy's line. This fact being reported by Captain W. H. Wade, the line was immediately doubled in strength and the enemy's skirmishers driven back to the second line of hills. General Turchin then gave orders to Colonel M. B. Walker, Thirty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry, to advance the front line of the brigade and occupy the first line of hills. This was immediately done, the second line moving at the same time, with the proper interval. Shortly after the brigade had arrived at the top of the hill it was observed that General Hascall's brigade, of General Judah's division, was moving in a double line of battle to the front, on a line of direction which brought it upon the rear of this brigade. Not understanding the nature of the movement, our lines stood fast until General Hascall's front line had passed our front line and his rear line our rear line. See map:

At this time General Baird gave the order that this brigade should advance as General Hascall's brigade advance, and the troops were immediately ordered forward, advancing in the order they had assumed. The face of the country was very rough, rising and fall-
