HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT

SHREVEPORT, DECEMBER 2, 1864.

Mr. A. R. McDonald,Shreveport, La.:

SIR: Your letter of the 21st of November to Lieutenant-Colonel Broadwell has been forwarded to me. The monopoly of the cotton trade having been granted to Mr. Fessenden, Secretary of the U. S. Treasury, by a law of the Federal Congress, the policy of the Confederate States Government is changed. No more cotton will be permitted to pass into the lines of the enemy. The Cotton Bureau has recommended the destruction of all cotton near the Mississippi below the Arkansas and above the mouth of Red River, and also the cancellation of the Belcher, Parkman, and other similar arrangements. Any cotton you may have within our lines, after the work of destruction is over, you will be permitted to export, subject to the terms and restrictions of the Cotton Bureau, provided it can be conveyed from the interior without interfering with the agricultural pursuits of the country. Our people must not be induced to neglect the cultivation of their fields to transport your cotton. Any means of transportation brought by you from without our lines will not be molested by the military authorities. I am opposed to the egress of cotton and offer you no encouragement or guarantees other than those stated, it being understood, as you state, that your permits from the Federal authorities will enable you yo take the cotton to Canada or other foreign country.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.
