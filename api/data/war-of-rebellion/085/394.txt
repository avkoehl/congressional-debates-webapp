General FISK:

I hear that the rebels have crossed the road going toward Paris. I will start for Renick, where they crossed; so reported. Came here to save this place last night. Citizens told me they were to attack it, also Huntsville. Was one hour behind them at Huntsville. I missed them between here and Huntsville. I do not know where I will stop.

Move the this point with what men you have. Leave Captain Shook at Brookfield for the present. The companies on the North Missouri Railroad will be ordered here in a few days.
