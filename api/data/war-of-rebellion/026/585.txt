Captain Farquhar writes that he is getting along well with the field works. He knew nothing of the troubles when he wrote.

Lieutenant Wheaton will tell you more than I can write. Everything that you can suggest will be attended to at once by me.

Ever truly, yours,

I. N. PALMER.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 6, 1863.

Major General JOHN A. DIX, Washington, D. C.:

General Palmer, under date of April 3, from New Berne, states, subsequent to special dispatch received here by Major Anderson, that General Foster feels tolerably strong in Washington for some days, but begs for re-enforcements. He wants 10,000, but will take any number that can be sent.

D. T. VAN BUREN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 6, 1863-10 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Brigadier-General Palmer writes, April 3, from New Berne, urgently asking General Dix for re-enforcements. Says General Foster is in Washington, N. C., and that the re-enforcements are needed to secure that place and New Berne. Why Foster did not write I know not. I am this moment in from Suffolk. General Peck thinks the enemy is still strong in front of him, but can, he thinks and I think, spare, say, three regiments a short time if North Carolina is in great danger. What shall be done? I return to Yorktown to-night. I have an expedition organized to start early to-morrow morning for Matthews County to destroy or bring in a lot of grain collected for the rebels.

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General.
