HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your two dispatches of 7 and 8.20 a. m. have been received. Respecting the two regiments of cavalry it was expected that you would call them all in whenever it suited your own objects best without any regard to their objects as pickets of the army.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: My last division has just reached railroad. I have got possession of the forks of the road at the place marked Flowers. General Ayres' division now has the lead and is advancing up the railroad. There is a cavalry force about three-quarters of a mile ahead with a battery. I shall endeavor to open connection from my right, as I advance, with the left of the Ninth Corps. The men give out fear-fully in the sun and compel us to move slowly to keep them in the ranks. Several officers have been sunstruck also.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy hold on firmly to their position yet, but I am extending my line till I can their left flank. Where I strike them along the roads they are intrenched. General Ayres has not perfected his arrangements yet nor made his final effort, and so far our losses are small. I have no chance to use my artillery to any advantage, and but four guns at most. It has rained hard here now for fifteen minutes.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I was just advancing at 2 p. m., with Ayres' and Crawford's divisions, when the enemy advanced simultaneously with us. The Maryland Brigade, on my left, gave way, but I believe ;the rest of the line holds them or has sent them back. It was a heavy fight for half an hour; at present it is nearly quiet. The enemy's infantry are reported passing down the road toward Flowers', my cavalry having been derived away from there.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
