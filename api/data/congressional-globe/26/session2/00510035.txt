Mr WEBSTER said he shou d detain the Se

norable member'.* remarks, a£ 1 e had really not
inet the argument of Mr W yesterday To begin
with the subject of Indian tieatics. The honoia
ble member had said that ihe fund arising from the
«ale of the Chickasaw lands bad all 'seen invented
to witbm sorn^ forty or fifty thousand dollars Mr
W.had founded what he had satd in relation to this
fund on the reiurns furnished fo the Sécate, and,
according to lhat document, tBe bahnce uninvested
amounted to $360,000, but bid add«d that he had
heard that $90,000 had beenjmve«ted siiicp Ihe date
of the returns Mr W hafl made m complaint of
the mode in which this fq*d had been invested,
so far as it had been invested, and, if
the whole of it had been invested, "o much
the better Butmngard to the two and a half
millions of Ihe fund belonging to the Winrcbagoes
and other tribes, and i h ch, accoiding to the
treaty, was to be mvesttd for the benefit of those

money, ui questionably le wasnsht, but « ill it
was a national debt, the "a*ion c\vid*h mor"1),
and it entered necessarily, as one important i em
or element, in o a s'atement ot the ficanc al condi-

had asked, if this were so, why ^ucb a statement
ought not, in ¡ike manner, to include the Indian
annuities'? They veie m lu'W, m effect Did
not the annual repof from ihe Department state
the amount cf tho'e annui íes as par' of the expen-
ditures for which Congress was to provide? Are
they not always in tne estimates? So ihe member
aeked why tbe pensions werp not to ce included?
The same answer might be made The amount
of that expenditure also was annually laid before
Congress, and it was provided lor as other demands
on the Government Mr W had net complained
of this amount of two and a half millions ot Ind an
debt, he himself iiad ne er opposed these treaties,
all he bad contended ior was, that as an amount
to be provided for, it was as much a p rt of the
public debt as if it h„d consisted ol borrowed mt-
ney, it was a demand which Congress was bound
to meet. In any general view, theiefore, of the
liabilities of the Government, was there one ele-

by the President on tne 8 h page oi his mes«age did

tated the country, there had bnen some men or seme

that Ihe me«sage charged this ft ndness for a na io¡ -

and had represented it as a broad and general
ground of disli cuon between parties, that one was
the advocate ot a national debt as of itself a good,
and the other the opponent of the existence of a
debt. Tms he regarded as in imputation wholly
unfounded, and it wa= on this «round that he had

Theie was one poit t in which (Mr. W said) tbe
honorable member from New York had entirely
misapprehended him He (\Jr. Wright) had said
that Mr W appeared to desire to avoid as a cnti

as a mat'rr of any de'icacy, had the Senate the
constitutional power of cngmat ng revfnue bills,
the very first th ng he should move, in his place,
would be to lay a tax on bo h these art cles of luxury.
Weie Mr W to draw an interetce from the
«peecn o> the honorable member, it would be that
it rather seemed to be bis on a opinion, and certain-
ly seemed ais > to be that ol he President, that it
would be wiser to witbcuaw the whole or a part of
the money deposit d with the States than to lay
taxes oa s Iks awl winec In this opinion Mr. W.
did not at all concur If the ques ion were be-
tween such a withdrawal and ihe imposition of
such a tax, he should witho it henUtion say, lay
the tax, and (eave the money with the S'ate* #here
it was He was grea ly mistaken if such a prefe-
rence did not meet the public approbation. He
was for 'axing ihis enormous amount of twenty or
thirty m llions of foreign pr< d*cts imported in a
single year, and a 1 consumed in the country, and

Mr W said he I eheved he had now noticed so
much of ihe honorable Se ialoi'< speech as required
a reply, and he wou'd re«ume h s seat with again
