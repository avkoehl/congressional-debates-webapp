HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS, May 2, 1863.

(Received 3 p.m.)

Major-General HOWARD:

I am advancing a strong line of two brigades to ascertain whether the enemy is retreating. General Birney reports that he has reached a brigade of the enemy in rifle-pits, posted, as I think, to cover the retreating column. I will attack if the enemy is not stronger than the reports so far reports so far represent him, and occupy the road by which he is retreating.

Please support my advance.

Very respectfully,D. E. SICKLES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 2, 1863-11.30 a.m.

General E. D. KEYES,

Yorktown, Va.:

Our cavalry ought yesterday or to-day to have been in rear of enemy, on the Richmond and Fredericksburg road, at its crossing of the Pamunkey, or in that vicinity, and have destroyed it. Use every possible means to get any information, and telegraph it to us and oblige.

Things are very lively here now.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General HOOKER,

Army of the Potomac:

Deserters from Pickett's division state that they saw Pickett on the 1st, and that no brigades have gone from Longstreet's command. They received orders to be ready to move last night, but the orders were countermanded. One of these is a Texan, who states that Hood was here yesterday. [M.] Jenkins' division is here.

General BUTTERFIELD,

Army of the Potomac:

Let me ask explanation of the last clause, "no signs of a movement then." Does that refer of Longstreet's move or General Hooker's?

Major-General.
