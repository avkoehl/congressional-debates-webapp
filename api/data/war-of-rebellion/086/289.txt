FORT SCOTT, KANS., October 27, 1864.

General CURTIS;

I have the honor to inform you that at 2 o'clock this p. m. I received orders to proceed with all prisoners of war to Fort Leavenworth. I immediately made arrangements for the march, and at 5 o'clock this p. m. I received the following orders:
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Fort Scott, Kans., October 27, 1864.

Captain J. C. W. HALL,

Assistant Provost-Marshal, Headquarters at Kansas City, Mo.:

CAPTAIN: By command of Major-General Rosecrans, you will proceed with the prisoners of war now in your custody at daylight to-morrow morning to Warrensburg, Mo., with the escort now guarding them.

By command of Major-General Pleasonton:

CLIFFORD THOMSON,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

I at once sent the following telegram to General Rosecrans, at Warrensburg, viz:

FORT SCOTT, KANS., October 27, 1864.

GENERAL: I am ordered by Major-General Curtis to proceed with all prisoners of war in this command to Fort Leavenworth, Kans.

J. C. W. HALL,

Assistant Provost-Marshal, in the Field.

I send the above telegram with the hope that the general may countermand the above orders before I get en route. The general, I trust, will not be displayed with me when I assure him that I have done all I could do to get them off, as he desired. I intended to get en route to-night, but I am informed that I would have been turned back. Being obliged to obey my last orders, I shall, however, make my report as provost-marshal in the field to the major-general commanding, upon whose staff I am.

J. C. W. HALL,

Captain and Assistant Provost-Marshal.

SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS.] HDQRS. ARMY OF THE BORDER,

Camp on Coon Creek, October 27, 1864.

Lieutenant R. G. Leaming, Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia, aide-de-camp, will take charge of all prisoners now in camp or found on the way to Fort Scott, and deliver them to the provost-marshal or to the commanding officer of the post, to be forwarded to Fort Leavenworth.

By command of Major-General Curtis:

C. S. CHARLOT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH IOWA CAVALRY,Diamond Grove Prairie, October 27, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

GENERAL: Fearing that justice will not be done my regiment in the reports made of the battle of Osage, I take the liberty to call your attention to the charge made by them on the enemy's right at a time when our line on the right had halted and were receiving a destructive fire from the enemy. At that time a perfect rout of our line appeared
