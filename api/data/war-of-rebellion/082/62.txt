CITY POINT, July 7, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

In making regular approaches would it not be well to avoid making any at the salient where General Barnard gave it as his opinion that a successful assault could be made, if one could be made at all?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 7, 1864-11.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Barnard never communicated any opinion to me. I presume, however, you and he refer to the salient on the Jerusalem plank road. If so, this is the best point for a regular approach; indeed, it is essential it should be taken before a lodgment in any other part of the line, if made, could be maintained. I will send you to-morrow early a report with a sketch.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 7, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS:

Please address a circular to corps commanders notifying them I have been called upon to present the names of officers deserving promotion to the rank of general, and requesting them to furnish such names as in their judgment are meritorious, specifying those who are first entitled to consideration, and giving as much in detail as practicable the services and reasons on which said recommendations are grounded. This to include promotions to the grade of major as well as brigadier-general.
