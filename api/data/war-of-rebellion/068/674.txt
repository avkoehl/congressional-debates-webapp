HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 1.10 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: General Rickett's skirmishers have struck the enemy's infantry skirmishers in heavy force. They drove our men a few yards back, but they recovered and now hold without advancing. The country is reported as very thick.

Respectfully,

THEODORE LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 12, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have put Cutler's division to relieve a part of my troops. With the rest of the Fifth Corps and a part of mine, a column of assault can be formed, which I am confident can carry the enemy's line at the Angle. Major-General Hancock agrees with me in this opinion.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 3.10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

In answer to your dispatch of 2.45 and that of Major-General Meade of same hour, I have to say that I think that both Griffin and Crawford should be used in the assault with the few troops I have available. Cutler's division has been put in the first line to relieve exhausted troops who have been firing all day, and can't be used for this purpose. The column should be a strong one to make it certain of success.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 4.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The right of my Third Division rests near the morass. I do not think it very strong, but it is as secure as I can make it, unless I use the troops that have just come up. The morass I speak of lies in front of what was my center when I occupied the rifle-pits on our original line.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Corps.

P. S.- If we don't assault I shall extend my right.

H. G. W.
