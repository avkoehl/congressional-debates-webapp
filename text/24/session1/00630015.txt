of our actual receipts into the Treasury in any-
particular vear, whether over or tinder the esti-
mate s„ Weie less noticeable, and were of less eom-
parativ e importance before the final payment of the
public debt at the close of 1834, as that payment,
from time to time, corréete d any lrregulaiity, and
supeiseded what will often hereafter be inevitable
without due precaution—the necessity of a resort
to ne* legislation whenever any considerable
excess or detieiency happens to occur in the w hole
rev enue Besides vv hat has already been remarked
on the influence which the increased cultivation
of cotton in this country has in various ways
exercised, and is likely to exercise hereafter, in our
rev enue from customs and lands, it might be made
a subject of further and veiy interesting inquiry
in connection w ith the uncertainty of the estimates
on those ¡sublets, affecting, as that cultivation
does, more remotely, not only our revenue from
lands, and customs, but the balance of trade and
the export of specie, as well as the continuance,
by means of mutual dependence among great in-
.erests, of many of oui peaceful and prosperous
relations both at home and abroad. But without
enteiiug, on this occasion, into further details
concerning any of these points, it may be men-
tioned, as a very striking result connected with
the last one,and as furnishing a strong presump-
tion in favor of gieater exemption hereafter from
fluctuations by war and commercial restrictions,
that while the quantity of cotton expoited from
this country has increased from half a million of
pounds in 1790 to over three hundred and eighty
millions "m lb35, and has exceeded in value,
during six oí the last ten years, all our other ex-
ports of domestic products of every description,
the manufacture of U at home, and chiefly m the
northern States has increased, from consuming
only a few bales more, to ninety millions of
pounds yearly, and to that extent creates a new
and strong bond of reciprocal advantage and har-
mony, and that while we now furnish, instead
of the small quantity in the first years of our
Government, quite fifteen sixteenths of the whole
consumption of raw cotton by England, and
seven tenths of that of Prance, all the present
exports of it to Europe, from all the rest of the
world, do not probably equal, if those two na-
tions could obtain the whole, one third of what
thev now consume, or one fourth of what they
now import from the United States alone. And
thus, while neither of them produces any of the
raw article, except a little in some remote de-
pendencies, they have an annual manufacture
now relying on it, and chiefly on the United
States, equal in France to eighty millions of dol-
lars, and in England to one hundred and eighty
millions of dollars, and constituting in the latter,
after it supplies her own large necessities at
home, over one half in value of her great annual
axports to all quarters of the globe.
Explanation of estimated Receipts from Miscellaneous
Sources
The estimate of receipts fiom bank dividends
nas been made at the usual rate, computed on the
present amount of stock still owned by the United
States, independent of what belongs to the Navy
pension fund. Should the bank divide a part of
its capital after the 3d of March next, and before
the close of the year 1836, the dividends leceived
for interest or profits will probably be somewhat
lower, but, on the other hand, there will then
be received into the Tieasury, instead of them, a
due proportion of the capital stock.
This department made seasonable inquiries of
the bank itself as to its probable course in respect
to the division of its capital, with a view to ap-
prise Congress of the revenue which ought to be
anticipated from that source in 1836; but, extra-
ordmaij as it may appear, at a period so near
the close of its charter, and after the discontinu-
ance of several of Us branches, it will be seen by
the correspondence annexed (G) that the bank
had then come to no decision on the subject
The sales of bank stock to the Navy pension
fund will probably not be deemed advisable by
Congress after the 3d March next, and hence the
receipts from those sales have been estimated less
than usual.
It is supposed that the other receipts from mis-
cellaneous sources will correspond nearly with
I those in 1835, except that the sum of #6,235,
j belonging to this Government out of the Neapol-
' lton indemnity, for the transportation of seamen,
at the time our vessels were seized, having in the
first installment been promptly and honorably
paid, according to treaty, has, since the last an-*
nual íeport, been adjusted, and accredited under
this general head. It gives me pleasure to add,
that about one hundred thousand dollars more
has been secured by means of that indemnity
on debts of long standing due from several of
the claimants to the United States, and over one
fifth of it has already been paid into the Treasury.
In pursuance of tht act of Congress on this sub-
ject, the balance of the first installment, as soon
as the awards were completed, was paid to those
entitled to it, and certificates were issued for the
remainder. All due under the second installment
has since been punctually discharged by the King
of the Two Sieihes, to the agent of the Treasury
abroad, and after some delay in its remittance
from Naples to Paris, with a view to make it in
a manner most advantageous to the claimants,
the whole has been received here, and the net
proceeds, as soon as ascertainable, will be imme-
diately paid over.
Explanation of the Estimates of Expenditures.
The expenditures in 1836 for ordinary purposes
are, as it has been seen, estimated at a still lower
sum than they were for 1835, but as the present
is a long session of Congress, the contingent ex-
cesses of appropiiations beyond the general esti-
mates, explained in the last annual report, have
been submitted as likely to be half a million larger.
It is gratifying to state, that independent of the
payments towards the national debt, leaving the
community with all its capital, and energies en-
tirely from that cause unburdened and untrain-
meled, the actual expenditures of the General Gov-
ernment have, on other subjects since 1833, been
reduced about four and a half millions of dollars
a year, or near nine millions m 1834 and 1835,
and the country at large, dunngthe same period,
relieved from taxation by reductions in the tariff,
equal to nearly twelve and a half millions a
year, or about twenty-five millions in all. The
probabilities as to still further reductions in
our expenditures for ordinary purposes during a
number of ensuing years, excluding any extra-
I ordinary grants on account of the present large
, surplus, or other causes, can best be weighed by
i a retrospect of the chief subjects of increase dur-
ing a few past years, and by a. discrimination be-
tween the items, which, are in their chaiactcr
Eermanentor tempoiary, and which still exist or
ave already expned The chief items of ln-
I creased expense during those yeais, which (from
an increase in some of our national establish
ments, caused by obvious reasons in most cases,
such as greater population and business, and a
rapidly extending frontier) will probably be
somewhat permanent, if not in some instances
firogressive, are most of the large additions to the
egislative expenses—the gradual augmentation
in appropriations for the judiciary, and the sala-
ries of district judges—the new bureau of Soli-
citor of the Treasury—the corps of mounted dra-
goons in the Army—the incieased number of, and
pay to officers in the Navy, and the extra com-
pensation to officers of the customs since the great
reductions in the taiiff.
The chief additional items of expenditures
during the last few years, which may be deemed
temporary in their nature, but which stdl con-
tinue in a greater or less degree, are the large
increase in the extinguishment of Ipdian titles,
and in grants of n volutionaiy pensions; the
payment of Virginia commutation claims; great
additions to our light-houses and custom-houses;
opening many new roads into the Territories,
the continuation of the Cumberland road; the
survey of the coast, more numerous allowances
of miscellaneous claims, and the building of
branch mints commenced the present year, though
their futuie support will be a new item of per-
manent expense. The issue of Virginia land
scrip, virtually receivable instead of money for
lands, is, in substance, though not in form, an-
other large item; because, though not included
in the usual exhibit of expenditures, it has in the
last four years exceeded a million of dollars, and
will in taw, and the «wwin^ rear, probably ex-
tend to eight hundred thousarm more Theitema
of magnitude in our expenses which have lately
existed, but are now either terminated or sus-
pended, are the building of the Potomac bridge;
though its repairs, lighting, and draws may here-
after be a durable charge; macadamizing Penn-
sylvania avenue, and several grants of money
for other purposes in the District of Columbia;
repairs of the Cumberland road; finishing and
enlarging some of the public buildings here;
refunding large amounts of duties under former
laws; the expenses of the war with the North-
western Indiansin 1833; repayments for advances
during the war of 1812; a large reimbui sement of
the naval pension fund; several special expired
appiopnations towards naval objects; and almost
everything connected with the public debt. A
tabular statement further illustrating many of
these changes, as well as others under all the most
important heads of expendituie, by exhibiting
the sums yearly paid under each material one
from 1816 to 1834 inclusive, has been prepared
with care, but is so voluminous that it will not
be submitted to Congress until some other appro-
priate occasion. In the estimates foi extraordi-
nary purposes the present year, it will be seen
that most of the increase is called for by the
omission to pass the annual appiopnations last
year for fortifications, and by the unusually large
surplus in the Treasury, which is not wanted for
ordinary objects, and which, it is supposed, can
be applied usefully to hasten those great improve-
ments connected with our military and naval
defenses, and which are of a character admitted
by all to be national, beneficial, and constitutional.
Under oui high state of financial prosperity, and
reposing in peace, the best poriod for due prepa-
ration for war, the undersigned consideis the
Treasury in a proper condition to meet any meas-
ures which the Executive or the appiopnate De-
partments have recommended for these desirable
objects, as well as any similar and additional
measures which Congress may be hkely to think
required by prudent foresight, and a properregard
for natiqnal character and safety.
V.—Surplus in the Treasury, and disposition of it.
It has been shown that the available balance in
the Treasury, overall outstanding appropriations,
on the 1st of January, 1836, is estimated at about
ten and a half millions, the expenditures for the
ensuing year for all purposes, whether ordinary
or extraordinary, enumerated in the schedules at
more than twenty-three millions, and the receipts
at less than twenty millions. Hence it follows,
that if the appropriations made, and the revenue
received, in 1836, shall be as large as the esti-
mates, and no laiger, the net surplus now appli-
cable to new and other objects will piobably, in
the course of the ensuing yeai, become reduced
to a sum between six and seven millions. This
sum, therefore, would in those events remain on
the 1st of January, 1837, as a net surplus, unex-
pended and unpledged. Consequently, most of
it could now be applied to other purposes not
included in the estimates, and liberally aid in
promoting any constitutional objects which Con-
giess may deem most expedient.
An unprecedented spectacle is thus presented
to the world of a Government not only virtu-
ally without any debts, and without any direct
taxation, but with about one-fourth of its whole
annual expenses defrayed from sales of its own
unincumbeied and immense tiacts of public
lands, and no .resort to even indirect taxation ne-
cessary, except forr the other three fourths, and
the pioceeds of that indirect taxation, though
largely and frequently reduced, yet accumulat-
ing so fast as to require further legislation to dis-
pose of or invest a considerable surplus on hand.
Whether this state of enviable prosperity be
justly attributable to the form of oui Govern-
ment—to the administration of it—to the char-
acter of our people—the physical advantages of
our country—or to all combined, it is a subject
of strong congiatulatipn, and exhibits a very re-
markable phenomenon in the history of taxation
and finance. Without dwelling on these primary
causes of our fortunate condition, or discussing
any secondary ones, such as the great demand
and reward in this country for either labor or
