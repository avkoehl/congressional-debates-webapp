HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-8 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

You have done very well indeed in getting forward through that difficult country so far. Make yourself as strong as you can and hold on. I will try and re-enforce you by Bragg's brigade in the morning, and establish direct connection with the Ninth corps pickets. We are going to hold on here.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,August 18, 1864.

[Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:]

GENERAL: I think the corn-field on our right cane carried by a vigorous effort to-morrow, if you should consider it desirable. The enemy will work hard to-night, and indeed was at work on his line when I advanced this afternoon. I have two brigades in line of battle, but the line is not a long one, as the First Brigade lost heavily when its flank was turned early in the action. There is a portion of the line unsupported. I sent the Eighty eighth Pennsylvania to support my right, which I propose to refuse before daylight. If my right is covered a section of artillery can be used to advantage in any attack upon the enemy's position in the corn-field. My loss has been severe in officers and men.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.- This note was written before yours was received. I am gratified that you are satisfied with the advance made to-day. It was very hard work.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-2.20 a. m.

General PARKE:

Is there anything more than cannonading intended by the enemy so far as you can ascertain?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to General Ord.)
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-2.30 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have sent out to the division commanders. As yet no report. As far as I can judge it has been simply a general cannonading. The reports of musketry continue the same as early in the night. Will forward reports from division commanders as soon as received.

J. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
