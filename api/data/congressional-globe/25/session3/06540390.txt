ATPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Public Defaulters—~Mr. Wise.
Ho. of Reps.
this House in fact, in actual service, to become
an executive slaved Is it the aim of the Presi-
dent still moie to prostiate the dignity of the
iegislative branch of Government* Would any-
other President have dared to propose such a
thing> I would ask the venerable- gentleman
fiom Massachusetts whether he would liave dared
to ask Congress to direct its committees, by law,
to report to him ' That gentleman's worst foes,
those who vilified Him most, never charged him
with thus insulting the dignity of Congress Is
tins the sort of committee you are now asking
from us? I would prefei that defalcations should
go on, that the public moneys should all be
squandered, that the public character and mor-
als should go with it overboard, to liaving the
great Unes of demafkation between the coordi-
nate branches of the Government destroyed, to
amassing all power in the Executive. This
would bring us at once, and at a leap, to the low-
est degree of degradation—whither defalcations
and general coriuption were only giadually and
slowly leading ua—to the very footstool of a
despot.
But,sir,I come to the important question now
With what view would the President have these
committees report to him ? He tells us, *' xoxtk a
view to a pt ompt ■) emoval ft om office " This brings
me to another branch of this subject I will pi ex-
ceed now to show that case aftei case has been
reported to the Executive, of defalcation, and nf
delinquency in office, and violation of duty, in
suboidmate officeis—icported by comrmssioneis
appointed by the President himself—-cases not
only of default, but fraud, of repeated applications
Of public money to piwate uses—no less than foity
Bince 1835, in three yeais—and yet the officeis
weie retained in office, and icstppointtd to office
after their delinquencies and moiattuipitude were
known to the Depaitment I will go fuither
they have been countenanced and encouraged to
Become defaulters, and to peijure themselves and
defraud the licasui y. I am not declaiming—I
will prove what I say. When I say/oiiy casts,
I mean that number, at least, which I can enu
iieiate since 1834—1 can give the names, I have
them before me I will fust take up the case ot
Joseph Reckless, a colltctoi at Peith Amboy,
New Jersey Iadveit to tins case particularly
to do General Jackson justice I believe Llmt he
was imposed on in this case by ixfuhe abshact of
testimony made out at the Treasuiy Depaitment
William Van Hook, of New Yoik, puferied the
charges against Reckless in a letter to Secietaiy
Woodbury
New York, January *i, 1815
Bir T lio following facts of I rand upon the Governmt nt
of the Untied ¡slates cuine to my knowledge some tune1
since but hung desirous ol satistying imsc It of tlieir tiuth
beiorc I submitted them to you, I del lyed doing <;o till ttus
time I now (eel it my dutv to charge J W Reckless, the
colif etor of i crth Ambov, New Jersey, with the following
frauds, committed by bun, in Ins othcial chatacter, upon
the G wernmuit
Fust charec —A willful omission to crcd t the fl wem
raeiit in Jm uecounts, wnli the sum of $147, received by
him as collector, on the. 18th Julv, 18J3, or thereabouts, lor
tonnage duly on the ¡schooner P uiiic, beize d by hid pr de
cet&or in oflke lor a vio ation of the r v< m law, uid u
winning under seizure when tícenme into ifhce,and which
remains unaccounted for it tins time Una sum was re
ceived from Messrs V becor &. bon, of this cuy, under a
compromise made with them by said collector, ot the sum
actually duo, and which amounted to about lour hundred
and seventeui doilirs
Second charge —llmt the said collector has charged the
United ¡states, m Ins quarterly accounts a sum ot about
one hundred dollars  pci (juarter, tor wages oí the boatmen
of hn revenue bar^c, more than he li is ev r pud them
The mode m which this 1ms been effrtted, was by obtain
mg from them receipts in bl ink as to the sums paid and,
ifier paying them, falling up the amount with such sums as
suited hia views
1tH8 practice commenced,! believe with the third quar
ter of 1833 and has been continued in all his accounts
since, as I believe, by comparing his accounts  for tbe first
two quarters of 183*J with those subsequently rendered
and by comparing them with the account* of the collector
who preceded him, I think the fact will apptar
The fiist charge can he proved bj F foecor& Son of this
citv, and the sei ond charge can be also proved b\ the com
pau on of the accouuts and by the boatmen in Perth Am
boy, a l also bv I W Bnnlev of Path Ambov, who
was his deputy lor sometime and was removed from office
because he would not consent to be the instrument of his
frauds Any communication you may think nt to make to
me will be answered promptlj
Re pectfuily, I am your obedient servant,
WIXI4AM VAN {IOOK
The Hon Levi Woodbur-í,
Secretary of the Treasury
Washington, January 5 1835
Sir I transmit, herewith, a letter to you from William
V in Hook, Esq , of New York, containing a representation
of frauds upon the Government, committed bv Josepti W
Reckless, collector of the customs at Perth Amboy, m "Vew
Jersey
Mr Van Hook is a gentleman of high standing for integ
rky, and, in addition to hia representation, Idonothesitate
to add my own belief of the charges made by him to their
full extent With the facts relating to the tonnage duty on
the schooner Pacific, 1 am personally acquainted   and the
receipt of the amount oí ¿147, and the withholding the
credit for it to the Government, are facts of which no doubt
6X1*13
The overcharge of wages to the crew of the revenue
boat, as detailed by Mr Van Hook, is no doubt correct
My personal ob ervuion and knowledge of the employment
ot that boat (being m view of my own house) would satisfy
me th it the aecount rendered is grossly overcharged, were
I not apprised of the faet otherwise
Circumstance , unneecssary here to be detailed, have
delayed tin making of these charges officially before this
time, huta proper examination into the conduct of the
collector w til substantiate these ind probably other frauds
I am, with great re-mect, sir, your obedient servant,
JAMES PARKER
Hon Levi Woodbury,
Secretary of the Treasury, Washington
Such were the, charges of Mr Van Hook,
vouched by the Hon James Parker, then a mem-
ber of the flouse of Representatives, and o*parti

chaises, and asked htm foi explanations Janu-
ary £U, 18J5, Reckless leplied, as follows
Washington, January ^1, 183a

With this letter the two íeceipts for whaifage
and the receipt of Wall, were tiansmitted Jan
uaiy 24,1835, Woodbury notified Van Hook and
Paiker of Reckless's explanation, in which, it
will be observed, he admits second chatge, and
offers excuse for it Ttbiuaty 2, 1835, Mr Van
Hook replied, as follows
New York, 1 ehruar ¡ 2, J835
Sir I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter ot the 24th ultimo, covering the eopy ot the an
swerof J W Beckltss to the charges ot hand preieired
by me against him, and asl nig my ' «i-bentordi sent to the
correctness of his explanations, and whether any further
inquiry is defied "
Your letter would have been replied to sooner, but my
absence from town has prevented it I maintain the utter
untruth of the explanations ne ha^ made I am ready to
prove the truth ot the charges made in all such paits not
admitted by the statement of Mr Reckless, or fully to tbe
extent ol tlietn as made, m such manner as you shall re
quire A copy of the origin U íeceipt of Mr Reckless for
the money n ceived under the compromise, and which I
can produce to you, wiH show a variance of the items con
lamed in n, and- m his statement, and will show an alter
thought miegord to the amount he alleges he has paid out
of the sum íeceived, I can, by this and other testimony,
prove that, at the time the settlement was made lor the
tonnage of the schooner Pacific, the accounts against her
had been ascertained, and that they were separately and
specifically paid tor by Messrs Secor, the owners of the
vessel, and will therefore fully snstam that charge
fed  accounts will show that he Ins applied f >r, and ob
tnmed fiom, the Treasury, large sums of money to pay the
expenses of his oifice since the receipt of this money, and
I cannot imagine a satisfactory rea&on why an hone«t man
should conceal the receipt of this sum, or any other , to mo
the reason he aasigns is utterly unsatisfactory, because I
believe it untrue
As regards the boatmen's wages, he admits the amounts
are untrue, and that the sums cliarged are beyond the sums
paid That charge requires no further proof, accoidmg to
my understanding of lus answer, should it be required, I
will furnish it I deny that the overplus money, or diifcr
ence between the money paid the boatmen, has been * x-
pended for public purposes and challenge Mr Reckless to
show the fact I assert that it was applied to his own use,
and to his emolument and this 1 can prove, if it is íe
quired As regaids the reason for stating his accounts in
the manner he allege*, th it he has done it under the advice
of Mi Bunley , this I also deny I will prove by Mr linn
lev that it i  wholly, and ui all its parts untrue He never
advised the mode of keeping oi rendering his accounts as
he alleg s, but, on the contrary, expressly stated to him, at
the Ume, tli it it was incorrect and improper
I am, sir, with respect, your humble and obedient ser
vant,                                                    WM   VAN HOOK
