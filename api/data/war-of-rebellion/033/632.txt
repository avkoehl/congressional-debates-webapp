HEADQUARTERS CENTRAL DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Sedalia, Mo., October 10, 1863-4 p.m.

Brigadier General JAMES TOTTEN:

Lieutenant-Colonel Lazear is following the enemy. He was 10 miles south of Otterville at 9 a.m. to-day, moving northeast. Major Kelly, with 300 men, is on the line of the Pacific Railroad, between here and Tipton. I have ample force to defend this place. General Ewing is moving toward Warrensburg, and Colonel Weer is at Clinton.

I am truly, yours,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI,Pilot Knob, Mo., October 10, 1863

Colonel ROGERS, Cape Girardeau:

Direct your forces at Bloomfield to keep well advised of any movements of the enemy below them. I am somewhat fearful that the rascals are concentrating at some point to make a dash on one or more of our outposts. How many fighting men have you at Bloomfield? Have the guns been removed? Matters are getting worse on the western border, and the success of the villains in that direction will encourage the demons on our border to greater efforts at outrage and murder. We can't be too vigilant. Be definite in your orders to Major Montgomery, and direct him to keep you thoroughly posted on every symptom of danger.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI,Pilot Knob, Mo., October 10, 1863

Captain RICE, Fredericktown:

You will keep well on the alert for any rascals that may be moving up from the lower counties. Keep constantly advised of the movements of the enemy. I am somewhat suspicious the rascals may be concentrating for a raid on some of our outposts. Give them fits if you get a chance at them. Grant them furloughs for all time. Keep me constantly posted.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI,Pilot Knob, Mo., October 10, 1863

Captain ELMER, Mineral Point:

Instruct all your guards at bridges, and patrols everywhere to be more vigilant than ever. Look well to Potosi and the region west of there. Keep the Eighth Provisional detachment with you until further orders. We may look out for trouble; let us be prepared for it. Knock in the head every guerrilla or whisky barrel you meet. Keep me advised of every symptom of danger at any point. Do not allow any of your men to scatter and straggle.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
