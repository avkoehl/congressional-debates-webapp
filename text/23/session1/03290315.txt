to act, h  would negiiu or lefu e to execute the

President? Could he say that the Consti'u ion
did not bind him to see the la* fai'i fully executed,
because it was one ofhis Sett tin  , and not bim-
seP,upon whom theservice wasspecia'lj 'mposed?

whethei (hey mpo"-* duties on tl e highest officer
of Sta'e, or the lowest subo dmate in a"y of lie

for the sole pulpóse of causing all executive tin
oers, from the highest to the lowes', f utlift lly to
p rform the servn.es, leqmr'd of then bylaw
that the people of the Ui i ed States have made
him their Chi f M igistra'e, ird th" Const'tuaon
Ins clothed him wi h the entire execu vepowei
of this Government' The prirciples imp'ltd in
these questions appear too plain to need elucida
üoíi
But here, also, we have a cot<rnporaneous con-
struction of the act, which shows that it was not
understood as in any way changing the Haüons
between the President and S cretary of theTreas
ury, or as placing the latter out of Executive
control, even in relation to the deposites of the
pubuc money Noi on this point arc we left to
any equivocal testimony Tha documet ts of the
Treasury Department snow that toe Secretary of
the Treasury d d apply to the Pi evident, ard ob-
tain his appiobation and sanction to the orign al
transfer of the public depo«i'es tothepicsent Bank
of the United States, and did carry the rneasuie
into effect m obedience to his decision They aLo
show that transfers of the pubhc depos tes from
the blanche  of the Bank of the Umted S ates to
State bank', at Cmlhcothe, Cu cmna'i,and Louis
ville, in 1819, were made with the appiobaticn of
the President, and by his authority Thev show,
that upon all important questions appertaining to
hi3 dtpartmert, whether they related to thepublic
deposites or other matteis, it was the constant
practice of the Secretary of the Treisuiy to ob
tarn for his acts the app^ival and sana'on of the
Piesident These acts, and thepiincipleson which
they weie founded, were known to all the depart
mints of the Government, to Congiess, and the
coun'ij , and, until very recently, appear never
to have been called in question
Thus was it settled by the Constitution, the laws,
and the whole practice of the Government, that
the entiie executive powe. is vested in the Presi-
dent of the United S Ue« that as incident to tl at
power, the right of apiointing -<nd remov irg those
office!  who are to aid him m the execution of the
ltvv«, wnh such ícstiictions only as the Cons'itu
Hon piescnbes, is vested m the President, thatthe
Secretary of the Tieasuiy is one of those officers,
that the custody of the public pi operty and money
is an executive function, which, m relation to the
money, has always been ex-eicised through the
Seoietary of theTieasurv and his suboidmates
that in the peifoi manee of these auties, he is sub
jectto the supervision and conuol of the Piesident,
and m all important measures having i elation to
them, consults the Chief Ma^istiate, and obtains
I his approval and sanction,  that the law estab-
j hshmg the bank did not, as it could not, charge
the relation bcaeen the President and the Secie-
taiy—did not releace 'he foimei from his ool ga-
llon to see the law faithfully txecuud, noi the
latter from the PrisidmA supervision and con-
trol, that afierwaids, and before, the htcietary
did m fact cot suit, and obtain the sanction of, the
Presiuent, to transfers and lemovals of the public'
deposites, and that all departments of the Gov en -
mcr>,arel the nation itsel!, approved or acquesced
in the^e acts and principles, a>- in strict conformity
with our Corsti ction ai ü laws
Dunng the last yea-, the approaching termina-
tio , accordu g t> tie provisions of its charter,
and th  so'tmn decision of the American people,
of the Bank of the United S ates, made it expe
dicnt, and i s exposed souses and corruptions,
nii.de it, in my opinion, the duty of the decretal y
< f'tie J reasuij to y iacc the mon ysoftheUi ted
S'ates in othei d pnsuot es The Se<-retaiy did
nrt concur m that opirion, rid declined giving
tfu nicesssry order,and direction So giant g
wtre the abuse" ard coriupuor of the bank, so
evident is fxed purpose to peisevere in their,
andsopa'pai I its uesign,by u money and power,
to control the Government and change l's chai-
acter, that 1 deemed it 'he imperative duty of the
executive auihonty, by the exertion of every
povvn confided to it by the Constitution and laws,
to cl cck i's epieer, and lessen its ability to do
mischief, even in the pa nful alternative of dismis
I - ng the head of one of the departments At the
tune the lernoval was made, other causes sufficient
to justify it existed, but if th<y had ro , tl e Sec-
retary would Lave been dismissed for this cause
only
His place I supplied bv one whose opimors
were well known to me, and whose frank txp-es
sion of ihem, in erothei si uation, and wrcse
generous saci fices of m'erest and fe l ng, when

I The res-o'u'ion of the Serate, as originally
framed, and as passed, if ltiefers to these acts,
presupj oses a right in thet body to riterfei e wi'h
1 this exeicise of executive power If th  principe
b  once admitted, it is not difficult to pel ceive where
it may end If, by a mere denunciation like this
resolution, the President should ever Le induced
to act, in a matter of official duty, contrary to the
honest convictions of his own mmd,in compliance
with the wishes of tne Senate, the constitutional
independence of the executive department would
oe as effectually desiroy^d, and us power as effec-
tual}' transfenerl to the Senate, as if that erd had
been nreomthsred by an amendment of the Con-
stitution But if the Sepa'e have a right to mter-
'erewttb the executive powers,they have also the
right to make that mterfeience effective ard if the
assert on of the j ower implied in the i esolution be
silently acquiesced in, we may leasonably appie
h nd that it will be followed at some future day,
by an attempt at actual enfoi cement The Senpte
may refuse, except on the condition that h" will
smiender his opinions to th'irs and obey their
will, to perform their own constitutional functions,
to pass the necessary laws, to sanction appiopua-
tions proposed by the House of P>epiesentatives,
and to confirm pioper nomn ations made by the
President !t has already been main amed (md
it is not conceivable that the íesolution of the
Petate can be based on any other principle; thit

of State, the Seeretanes of Wai end the ¡Navy,
and the Postmaster Geneia!, each in succession,
be declai ed independent of Uie President, the iub-
onhnates of Congiess, and removable only with
the concuuence of the Senate Followed to i s
consequences, this pnn-iple will be found effect-
ually to destiov one coo dirate lenaitmcnt of the I
Goveitimeat, to concerníate ir the hands, of the i
Senate the whole executive powci, and to leave
the Presidentas pdwerlessa"? he would be useless—
the shadow of authority, after the substance had
depai ted
ihc time and the occasion which have called
furth the resolution of the Senate seem to impose
upon me an additional obligaron not to pass it
over in silence Neaily forty five yeara had the
Piesident exercised, without a question as te his
rightful Suthontv, those powers, for the recnt
ascumotion of v hich he is now denounced The
vicisfci udes of peace ard war had attended otir
Government, violent par les, watchful to take
-dvantige of any seiming usuipation on the part
of theExecutivi,had distiacted our counsels, fre-
quent removals, or forced lesignations, in every
sers  tartamount to íemovals, had been made of
the Secretaty and other officers of the Treasury,
and yet in ro one instance is it known that any
man, whe hei patnot or p irtisan, had laiscd hu
voice aba rst it as a v olat on of the Constitution
The espfd.ercy and justice of such changes, n
reference to public efficeis of all giades, have fie-
qjcntly been tne topic of discussion, but th 
cons'itutional right of the President to appoint,
contiol, and itmove the head of the Treasury, as
weil as of all other depaitments, seems to have
been universally conceded And what is the
occasion upon v/hich other principles have b en
first officially asserted ' Th  Bank of the Unit A
States—a great moneyed monopoly—had attempt-
ed to obtain u. lenewalof its chai tei, by controlling
the elections of the people and the action of th 
Government The use of its corporate funds ard
powe - in *hat attempt was fu'ly disclosed, and it
was maae known to the Piesident thut the coi po-
litlón was outt.rg in trun the same course of
rreasu e«, With the v ie\v of making ane ther vigor
ous elkrt, through an mterfeience in the elections
of th" peop'e, to control public opinion and foics
th  GoveinrienJ. to yie'd to its aemert's This,
with its corrupt on of the pi ess, us violationofits
c! art^ns. exilusion of tl e Gove-nm^nt directors
fioro its proceedings, its ne_lect of duty, and ar-
rogant pietensiois, made i', in the opinion of the
Presiden', incompatible vvitfi the public inteiest
and the safety of our ins i utions, that it should
longer be employed as the fiscal fgentof theTreas-
uiy A Secine"y of the Treasury, appointed
m the recess of th  Senate, who had not been con-
firmed by thit body, and whom the President
¡right or rc'ght not, at hi3 pleasure, nominate to
them, reí used to do what his superior in the cx-
ecutivedepaitrnentconsidered the most imperative
of his duties, and became, m fact, however inno-
cent his motives, the protectot of the bank And
on this occasion it is discovered, forthe first time,
that those who framed the Constitution misunder-
stood it, tnat the first Coi gress and all its success-
ors have been undera delusion, thatthepracticeof
near forty five yeai sis but acont nued usurpation,
that the Seorctai y of the Treasury is not responsi-
ble to the Presiden', and that to remove I im is a
violation of the Constitution and laws, for which
the Pres'denttleserves to stand forever dishonored
on the Journals of the Senate
There aie also some o her fiicumstances con-
nected with the discussion and passage of the les-
olution, to which 1 feel it to be, not only my right,
but my duty to íeter It appears, by the ftmrnai
of the Senate, that among the tvventv six Senators
who voted foi the resolution on its final passag ,
and who had suppoi ed it n. deba'e, in its original
foim, weie one of the Sena'OiS from the State of
Maire, the two Senatorb frun New Jersey, and
one of the Senatois fiom Ohio It also appears
by the same XGurnal, and by 'he hies of the Sen-
ate, that the Legislate i es oft! ese States had sever-
ally expressed then opinons in respect to the
executive pioceedmgs drawn m question be'oie
