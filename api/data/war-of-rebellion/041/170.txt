During last night the fleet shelled us without intermission, but without result. We have only been fired at during the day by a few skirmishers. No one hit. It is the first day of calm since the 24th.

I am very respectfully, &c.,

ON THE FIELD,

May 31, 1863.

This morning the enemy's sharpshooters, deployed in front of a party of my lines under cover, opened an irregular fire, which has been kept up all day. The cannonade, directed at my redancs and an attempted enfilade of the works, has been quite vigorous at times, never entirely ceasing. About 4 o'clock this evening, the fleet below commenced shelling furiously, and kept it up two hours and a half.

Last night the fleet shelled us from 11 o'clock until sun-up this morning; all this resulting in wounding 1 man. I have sent 200 men to relieve that number of Colonel [I. G. W.] Steedman's men, on the left. Since their arrival there this evening, I learn 2 of them have been wounded severely.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. R. MILES,

Colonel, &c.

The fleet indulged in its customary shelling last night, and at intervals to-day. The enemy's batteries for the last twenty-four hours have been steadily playing on our front, attempting at times to enfilade the works. No serious result. Sharpshooters, as usual, have been plying their vocation on both sides. So far as can be learned, on immediate attempt will be made to carry the works by assault, the enemy not having recovered from the effects of his last attempt upon us.
