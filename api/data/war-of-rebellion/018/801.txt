WINCHESTER, VA., September 2, 1862-3 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Simultaneously with your order I received information that a column of 20,000 of the enemy is coming down the valley, and supposed to be now within 20 miles. I send cavalry out to make a reconnaissance. If true, I shall have little time to get the Government property away. There are about 80,000 rations here and a larger amount of ammunition, which must be destroyed of a rapid movement is necessary. There are sufficient guerrilla forces of the enemy at hand to immediately occupy the place. Shall I destroy the subsistence and ammunition or endeavor to defend or remove it?

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I leave Winchester to-night. The enemy is reported in some force in my front. I may have to go via Martinsburg. Can reach Harper's Ferry easier by that route, and may have to go that way to do so safely.
