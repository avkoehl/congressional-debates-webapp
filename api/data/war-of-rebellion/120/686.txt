While this matter was in progress Lieutenant-General Grant assumed command of the army and received, as I understood, some instruction from yourself to communicate with General Butler on the subject of exchanges, since which time I have received no reports from General Butler, being his junior officer; but I am under the impression that the precise difficulties which stood in the way of exchanges a year ago are in full operation at this time, and that the fault is not with this Government, but with the rebel authorities.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
