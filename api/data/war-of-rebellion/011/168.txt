HEADQUARTERS,Cumberland Ford, May 6, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL:

In pursuance of instructions from the honorable Secretary of War, I have from time to time notified him of the position of thinks in this line of operation, hence my suggestion as to the Home Guard.

A rebel cavalry, force has been organized near Lexington with the avowed purpose of joining Humphrey Marshall. I have ordered the Home Guard to be organized at various points, in order to keep open my communications.

Kirby Smith is near Cumberland Gap, with 13,000 men, and threatening my flank and rear, in the hope of dividing my force, which he would if in front.

I have stationed Spears' brigade so as to cover London. I do not believe that Smith will attack; if he does, I have no apprehension as to the result. I have two lines of telegraph to London, so that if one should be cut the other will be servicable.

The morale of my command is rapidly improving.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Cumberland Ford, May 6, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The rebels are coming in the neighborhood of Lexington and a cavalry force is openly in the field. I have fears for the safety of a train of ammunition and guns coming this way, and have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Munday, with his entire mounted force, to proceed by force marches to meet them. Kirby Smith is now in the neighborhood of Cumberland Gap, with a force of 12,000 or 15,000 men. It is said that he contemplates an attack upon our position. We are prepared. I strongtly and respectfully recommend that the Kentucky Home Guard be called into immediate service to the number of 5,000 men.

Otherwise communication with Lexington may be cut off.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

News from Corinth this morning is to the effect that Beauregard has been ordered by Jeff. Davis to change his position, and that re-enforcements on their way to Corinth have been stopped. Their new point for concentration is unknown. Reconnaissance in force will probably be made by General Pope this afternoon. I go with it, and will advise you from the field. All other movements progressing. Weather fine.
