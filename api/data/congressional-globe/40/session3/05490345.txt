1869.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GBO&E.
84$
It is probable that the amount already asked
for under various Pacific railroad enterprises
will far njore than double the figures I have
given.
Sir, there are many cogent reasons why the
public domain should be made to contribute,
by just processes, to the aid of great internal
improvements, by means of which much of
the vast territory of the Republic has been
opened to industry and enterprise, but there
can be none given to justify the disposal of
those lands—a trust we hold for the' world's
poor—at private sale for private speculation.
Still less justice is there in permitting, un-
der the pretentious guise of the treaty-making
power, the despoiling of the people's right iu
that portion of the public domain now occu-
pied by Indians. That, however, has been
done in my own State and elsewhere. At the
last session of this Congress this House placed
on that policy a mark of emphatic condemna-
tion. Great tracts of valuable lands, fertile,
accessible, and well located, have under the
treaty system been ceded to speculators. It
has been done in the secrecy of executive
action at the other end of this Capitol, and
clothes itself in the robes of a sovereign attri-
bute of the (xovernment.
Look for a moment at the pretense raised by
such action, and wonder, Mr. Chairman, at
the presumption of those who claim the exer-
cise of such power to be legitimate. No In-
dian tribe has ever been admitted by this
nation to have anything but a possessory title
to lands in their occupancy. They have never
had a power of sale conceded to them, nor
could they make a treaty with any foreign
nation or even Sell their lands to private indi-
viduals. The reason is plain. The right of
eminent domain rests in the Republic, and
not in the Indians who may occupy a portion
of the soil. The control of the public lands,
by express terms of the Constitution, is del-
egated to Congress; not the treaty-making
power, which consists of the President and
Senate only. The Constitution says:
"The Congress shall have power to dispose of and
make all needful rules and regulations respecting
the territory and other property belonging to tM
United States."
During the debate to wliieh I have already
referred as occurring at the last session it will
be remembered that the honorable gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. LawbexcjeJ presented a very
clear argument against this abuse of the treaty
power, and with the valuable aid of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Butler] sub-
mitted a striking array of legal authorities in
support of this position.
As a proof of the injury which this system
inflicts, let me mention the fact that already
about one fortieth of the area of the State of
Kansas has been ceded away to a few corpo-
rations and individuals by treaty, and there
are treaties now pending which, if successful,
will dispose of over one ninth of the entire
area of the State. In proof of the character
of these immense land speculations, as indorsed
by the Senate, let me submit here a table care-
fully prepared at the Interior Department, show-
ing the amount of lands thus' wrongly dis-
posed of:

* Now before the Senate.
By this schedule it appears that 1,771,350
acres of Indian land have been disposed of in
Kansas in eighteen different divisions, a large
proportion being to private individuals and not
at all coupled with any pretense of benefiting
the State by public improvements. A further
examination of the table will show that of over
one and three quarter million acres disposed of
underthisabuseofthe treaty power, nearly eight
hundred thousand acres have passed into the
hands of three individuals. But, sir, this is but
a trifle beside a proposition to the character of
which I called the attention of the House at its
last session. I refer to the proposed Osage treaty.
The Osage lands in Kansas, ceded by the
treaty of September 29, 1865, amounted in all
to 8,222,402acres. The diminished reservenow
occupied by the Osage tribe, which, however,
is to be included under the operations of the pro-
posed railroad treaty, covers an area of 7,470
square miles, or4,780,800acres; makinga total
area proposed to pass into the hands of specu-
lators of not less than 8,003,203 acres of valu-
able lands. There is sufficient to make, under
the operations of the preemption laws, not less
than 50,020 homesteads of 100 acres each.
Allowing these to be occupied within the term
the law allows for settlement, by families aver-
aging five persons each, and we shall have a
population of-250,100 souls on a tract it is now
proposed to throw into the hands of a few men.
About six million acres ofthese lands are arable,
and nearly all is valuable for stock raising.
If we take the 1,771,350 acres already sold
undar this wrong interpretation of the treaty
power and add thereto this last gigantic at-
tempt to plunder the public domain, we shall
find that within the State of Kansas alone,
under this system, there has been actually
or prospectively transferred from under the
feet of the settler and farmer to the hands of
the speculator and monopolist an aggregate
area of 9,774,566 acres ofland, fertile and valu-
able, all of it located iu the most desirable situa-
tions in the State, whether we regard the
fertility of soil, proximity to the principal water
courses, or the present and prospective lines of
railroad communication.
The whole amount of land thus passed or
proposed to be into few hands would make
61,091 farms, of 160 acres each, thus affording
homes to at least 300,000 persons. If we take
the total amount paid or proposed to be, for
this great body of lauds we shall only have a
total of $0,664,154, or an average price per
acre of about thirty-six cents. The highest
price paid under any of these treaty sales has
been but $2 50 per acre—this, too, for lands
worth in the market an average of ten dollars—
while the lowest offer yet made has been but
twenty cents an acre. Every acre of this nearly
ten millions could have been, within a reason-
able period, sold to actual settlers at the reg-
ular preemption price, who would have eagerly
sought, as they have done under disadvan-
tageous circumstances, to have obtained farms
so favorably situated.
These lands were not needed for the con-
struction of our railroads, the munificence of
Congress having given to Kansas ample fran-
chises to aid the construction of a system of
roads commensurate with the importance of
her position in the great interior continental
railroad development of our day and genera-
tion. I say this deliberately, fully awaro of
the fact that I have in some degree contributed
to the bestowal of those lands. The evil effect
of this misuse of the treaty power has not been
seen all at once. It needed that the specula-
tors, grown reckless by success, should make
the last bold attempt.
The loss to the Indians as well as to the
Government which this system has entailed
is apparent. The total area of 9,774,566 acres
which now has or will have an average of about
thirty-six cents per acre, would under the pre-
emption system have netted, all expenses of
survey, Land Office system, &c., included, "not
less than $12,661,747.
But this isbyno meansa just-estimate'of the
