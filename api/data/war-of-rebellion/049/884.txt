Major-General PICKETT:

No news from Hamilton; no danger there yet. Can we do anything for the people of Suffolk? I fear not. If possible, I will go there and fight Butler over, anyhow. I shall withdraw troops to-morrow from Franklin, unless you think we could catch them below Suffolk. I will move down, and, if the enemy are certainly gone, recall Griffin. Excuse me for troubling you so much.

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General.

General GEORGE E. PICKETT:

The following dispatch received from Franklin, dated 20th, to General Ransom:

A deputation of 2 ladies from Suffolk came last night. General Butler has notified the citizens of Suffolk that they must take the oath of allegiance to the Federal Government or leave immediately. They are loyal to the South, and wish your advice on the subject. Those left in Suffolk, if they should leave it, would lose their all, and not be able to support themselves in our Confederacy. Tuesday is the day fixed. He is to send a provost-marshal and troops there on that day to administer the oath. All quiet here.
