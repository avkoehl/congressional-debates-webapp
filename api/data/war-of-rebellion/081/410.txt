HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General GRIFFIN,Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires to know if the brigade sent by you to support the left has returned. General Meade has informed him that he may be called upon to-day to send troops to support General Wright. In that event he desires you to be prepared to send troops [a brigade] if called upon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864.

General GRIFFIN:

I have been having your left under consideration, and will try to strengthen you there if I can. I am awaiting instructions myself. It seems to me that the only way to hold that place is to have plenty of troops near you to prevent a flank attempt and re-enforce you. If General Meade will allow me anything in reserve I will let you have it.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, June 25, 1864.

Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: In reply to you note of this morning, I beg to state that the Maryland Brigade returned to my command at 7 o'clock last night.

Very respectfully,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I propose to relieve one of my brigades on the line by the Maryland Brigade after dark to-night. In the mean time, if called upon, I think it advisable to send Colonel Dushane, as it is impossible to withdraw a brigade from the line in daytime without heavy loss.

R. B. A.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, June 25, 1864.

General WARREN,Commanding:

GENERAL: There seems to be some movement of the enemy about the Gregory house opposite my right. I regard this point as the weakest one on our line. I obstructed the road last night. The enemy has several batteries about the Gregory house, which control the plank road. I will report in person this evening.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
