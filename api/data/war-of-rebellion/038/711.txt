Major-General BUCKNER, Mobile, Ala.:

General Ruggles uniforms me that the enemy is moving down Mobile and Ohio Railroad. L I consider it a mere raid. If you could spare a regiment, I think it advisable to send it up the road at once. You can withdraw it whenever you wish.

COLUMBUS, April 2, [1863]-4 p. m.

Colonel BARTEAU, Verona:

(Care of Captain Ingate, Okolona.)

Concentrate your troops, harass the enemy, take command of all other mounted troops near you, and strike the enemy a blow in his flank or rear, if possible. Order Captain Gillelyn's troops to co-operate with you when necessary. Ascertain the strength and intentions of the enemy and keep me advised. If the enemy moves in force on Okolona, Aberdeen, or Columbus, you must retire before or follow him close, to concentrate our entire force to make a stand. Answer.

DANIEL RUGGLES.
