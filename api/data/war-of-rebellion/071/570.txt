CUMBERLAND, August 1, 1864.

Captain PETRIE,

Orleans:

Come up to Cumberland at once. You can run back if it is thought best. Direct Colonel Stough to follow you up with his command, leaving the three companies at Big Cacapon.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

NEW CREEK, August 1, 1864.

General KELLEY:

I left four miles out of Greenland Gap at 3 o'clock this afternoon. I can hear of nothing more than McNeill with 150 men at Moorefield, who have just returned from their Old Town raid.

CUMBERLAND, August 1, 1864--1 a. m.

Captain C. J. HARRISON,

Orleans:

A cavalryman just in reports that the rebel force divided at Mrs. Bell's, about four companies going toward Little Orleans, and the balance turned off the pike and went toward Bloody Run. This may or may not be reliable.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, August 1, 1864.

Colonel THOMPSON,

North Branch:

It is reported that the rebels are moving from Hancock west by the National pike. You will send a small scout via Old Town toward Flintstone and ascertain and report promptly if the enemy are moving on that road. Keep your scouts well out and know constantly the situation of matters about you. A few hours more will undoubtedly develop the movements of enemy. The two men I send with this are old Ringgolds; use them if you need them.

Yours, &amp;c.,

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., August 1, 1864.

(Received 9 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Detachment of Eighth Illinois Cavalry returned from Emmitsburg; reports no enemy in that vicinity, but heard rumors of rebels crossing back into Virginia at Clear Spring and Hancock.
