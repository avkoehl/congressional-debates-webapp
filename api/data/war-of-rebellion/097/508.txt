HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,April 2, 1865.

General S. S. CARROLL,

Cumberland:

Make the arrangements at once. The brigade as mentioned will be commanded by General Duval. General Emory will be up to-morrow to relieve you. Provide the brigade with its transportation complete, and let it march here, through Romney, &amp;c. It will take four or five days, but let it come with his transportation and subsistence. Detailed orders will be sent by mail or special messenger. Please answer when the brigade will start.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General, &c.

CUMBERLAND, April 2, 1865.

General C. H. MORGAN:

Your telegram just received. Brigade will start early Wednesday morning; everything complete. It will take five days to make the march. The Seventy-fourth Pennsylvania is about 600 strong now. The Twenty-eighth Ohio is only about 220 strong. The First West Virginia Veterans cannot get here in time to go with the brigade Wednesday, as the Seventy-fourth Pennsylvania has to go from Green Spring Run to relieve it. I'll order it by rail far as Martinsburg, to march from there to Winchester, and will reach there at the same time the rest of the brigade does. Its transportation will go with the brigade.

S. S. CARROLL,

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully,

This morning General Grant reports Petersburg evacuated, and he is confident Richmond also is. He is pushing forward to cut off, if possible, the retreating army. I start to him in a few minutes.
