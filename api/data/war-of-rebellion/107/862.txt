Major-General FRANKLIN:

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 24, 1862--10 a. m.

General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that you send out small reconnoitering parties across the river in the direction of Charlestown and Martinsburg, in order if possible to ascertain where the enemy is in force. The officers commanding should be instructed to advance very carefully, throwing forward scouts so as to keep their main forces advised of any appearance of the enemy. Let one party cross near the mill below Shepherdstown, and notify General Porter when this party is to cross the river. I suggest that a squadron be detailed for this duty and that two or three small parties from it be sent across first, to feel the way.

Very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
