THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 8,
I understood that on the motion of the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin this section, as it was pre-
pared by tJie Senator from Massachusetts, was
stricken out, and one inserted which he wrote,
in these very words.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
understands that that was amended before the
vote was taken on the motion to strike out.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What is the pending
question?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the motion.to adjourn. By unani-
mous consent this debate has been allowed.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I hope the motion to
adjourn will be withdrawn.
Mr. MORTON. I prefer not to withdraw
it. I am satisfied we cannot get through.
The motion was agreed to; and (at five
o'clock and fifteen minutes p. m.) the Senate
adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, February 8, 1872.
The House met at twelve o'clock m. Prayer
by Rev. J. P. Newman, D. D., Chaplain of
the Senate.
The Journal of yesterday was read and
approved.
CORPORATION INCOME TAX.
Mr. DAWES. I ask unanimous consent
to take from the Speaker's table the bill (S.
No. 362) declaratory of an act entitled ':An
act to reduce internal taxes, and for other
purposes," approved July 14, 1870. I do not
ask the House to pass the bill at this time.
I desire to raise a question and submit it to
the House for the disposition of the bill. It
will not take five minutes.
The bill was read for information. It de-
clares that the true intent and meaning of the
act to reduce internal taxes, and for other pur-
poses, approved July 14,1870, was to exempt
from, the payment of the tax of two and a half
per cent, per annum all dividends of earnings,
income, or gains, and undivided profits of any
bank, trust company, savings institution, insur-
ance company, canal-navigation company, and
slack-water navigation company, declared or
made, or which accrued or were earned and
added to any surplus, contingent, or other
fund, during the months of August, Septem-
ber, October, November, and December, in
the year 1870, in all cases where such coipora-
tions had already paid, or would hereafter pay,
upon the dividends of earnings, income, or
gains, and undivided profits of the previous
months of that year, a tax equal to at least
two and a half per cent, per aunum ; and to
give effect to such intent, the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue is authorized and directed
to remit or refund, as the case may be, the
tax assessed and levied or paid upon all such
dividends of earnings, income, or gains, and
undivided profits, for the last five months of
the year 1870, to all such corporations as have
paid or shall pay a tax upon all the dividends
of earnings, income, gains, or undivided profits
of the year 1870 and 1871, equal to at least
two and a half per cent, per annum.
Mr. HOLMAN. I object to the consider-
ation of that bill, and call for the regular
order.
Mr. DAWES. Allow me to state what I
desire to do in reference to this bill. I wish
to raise a constitutional question between the
two Houses. I do not desire to take up any
time, but merely to ask the House to lay this
bill on the table, and I will then introduce a
similar bill, and move its reference to the
Committee of Ways and Means.
Mr. HOLMAN. I have no objection to
that.
The bill was taken from the Speaker's table,
and read a first and second time.
Mr. DAWES. I move that the bill be laid
upon the table.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. DAWES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was laid upon the table; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. DAWES, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill (H. R. No. 1415) declaratory of
an act entitled "An act to reduce internal
taxes, and for other purposes," approved July
14, 1870; which was read a first and second
time, referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means, and ordered to be printed.
CONNECTICUT RIVER.
Mr. KELLOGG, by unanimous consent, sub-
mitted the following resolution; which was
read, considered, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested
to transmit to this House a copy of the report of the
engineer in relation to the improvement of the Con-
necticut river, with the accompanying papers that
have been returned to the Department smce thelast
annual report.
Mr. KELLOGG moved to reconsider the
vote by which the resolution was adopted;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. HOLMAN. I now demand the regular
order.
EDUCATIONAL FUND.
The House resumed, as the regular order,
the consideration of the bill (H. R. No. 1043)
to establish an educational fund, and to apply
the proceeds of the public lands to the educa-
tion of the people.
The SPEAKER. The pending question is
upon the motion of the gentleman from Wis-
consin, [Mr. Eldridge,] to lay upon the table
the motion of the gentleman from Mississippi,
[Mr. Harris,] to reconsider the vote by which
the substitute offered by the gentleman from
