HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Monticello Road, February 19, 1865-9. 50 a. m.

Lieutenant M. G. HUDSON,

Aide-de-Camp and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inform you that I started this morning on a road turning out of the Columbia and Monticello road, fifteen miles from Columbia, and moving by Cedar Creek Post-Office and Brown's Post-Office, but my scouts having reported the enemy two miles ahead of me on that road I have turned across, and struck the Winnsborough and Columbia road, some fourteen or fifteen miles from Columbia (near Nelson's house). I shall move up on this road and ascertain with certainty whether the enemy is moving toward Winnsborough or Monticello, and get in front of him as directed in orders from General Wheeler last night. In obedience to instructions to withdraw the regiment left on the Columbia road in case the enemy should move toward Winnsborough, I have directed Colonel Hagan to withdraw it. There will consequently be nothing left on that road. The enemy, however, at last accounts had not advanced from Columbia on that road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
