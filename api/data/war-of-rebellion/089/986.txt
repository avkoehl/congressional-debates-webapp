Major General G. G. MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The several stations send this information: That at 2 p.m. infantry came from the left on the Boydton plank road in scattered detachments and located themselves as follows-two regiments broke ranks in vicinity of lead-works, two by the houses about one-third of a mile southwest of the lead-works, four in the camps south and west of the large fort west of the Weldon railroad. At 4 p.m. about 1,200 came from the west on the Boyton plank road and pitched camp east of lead-works. At 4.30 p.m. about 800 came from the west upon the same road and moved in direction of Petersburg. The enemy's camps and lines in the vicinity of the Weldon railroad, and to some distance east of the lead-works, have assumed about the same appearance they had before the late move.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Colonel and Chief Signal Officer.
