DECATUR, September 25, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The forces from Chattanooga have not arrived, nor have they reported from Stevenson, as they promised. If they do not come soon it will be of no use to follow them up afoot.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, September 25, 1864.

General ROUSSEAU:

Re-enforcements from Chattanooga not yet heard from. If not yet at Stevenson, I think they had better be sent by the other road, as they will reach the enemy some is hours sooner. If they come here we must march thirty-six miles. We have none ready. All night waiting for these troops to arrive.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., September 25, 1864.

General ROUSSEAU:

It is now 1. 40 p. m. and only 700 of the 2,500 men promised to be sent yesterday from Chattanooga have reported at Stevenson, and they cannot possibly arrive here before 5 o'clock this p. m. We cannot leave here before sunset. Our force will then only be 1,100 infantry and 250 cavalry. To wait for the balance of the 2,500 we cannot leave before evening with the present condition of the roads. We can't reach Elk River before day after to-morrow, and if the enemy destroy all the bridges we will be delayed half a day getting over. Under these circumstances it appears to me to be far better that the troops now coming be stopped at Stevenson and be sent around by Nashville, as by that route they can reach Pulaski, with no marching, by 8 o'clock at furthest to-morrow a. m. A thousand or 1,200 men at least should be left at this post. We have no idea of their strength, but the enemy is outside our pickets in line of battle, displaying every considerable force, and it is not improbable that Wheeler, who was certainly at Moulton yesterday, may have left a portion of his force to demonstrate against this place, and to avail himself of any chance to attack it. I think, if any movements is to be made from this post it would better be made down the river on south side, and if the force is not large that is left by the enemy we can destroy him and capture all the prisoners, as I understand they are being crossed at Bainbridge and Lamb's Ferry. If they are in force it is absolutely necessary we fall back and hold this position.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, September 25, 1864-8 p. m.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER, Decatur, Ala.:

It is intended that all the troops from Chattanooga shall come here, at the earliest possible moment, by rail. If any have reported to you send them back at once.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
