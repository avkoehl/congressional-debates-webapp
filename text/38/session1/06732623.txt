THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Reports are
still in order. If there be no reports, the question
is on the motion of the Senator from Indiana.
Mr. HALE. Has everything been gone
through with under the rule? Have resolutions
and joint resolutions been called for?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Resolutions
and joint resolutions are not required to be called
foe by the rule.
Mr. HALE. I am glad of that. [Laughter.]
Mr. CARLILE. Is the motion of the Senator
from Indiana subject to amendment?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is
of opinion that it is not. The question is on the
motion of the Senator from Indiana.
The motion was agreed to; and the considera-
tion of the joint resolution (S. No. 8) for the re-
lief of the State of Wisconsin was resumed as in
Committee of the Whole.
Mr. HENDRICKS. This question has been
somewhat debated,and I desire to say to the Sen-
ate simply that the joint resolution provides for
the payment to the State of Wisconsin of her five
per cent, of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands within her limits. There were some equi-
ties connected with this claim which the commit-
tee found some difficulty in adjusting, but finally
arrived at what they believed to be a fair and
equitable adjustment of the rights of the several
parties, the Government as well as the canal com-
pany and the State of Wisconsin. The Commit-
tee on Claims to whom this joint resolution was
referred were unanimous in favor of it as leported.
I ask that there be a vote upon it.
The PRESIDENTjirotonporc. The question
is on the amendment reported by the Committee
on Claims in the nature of a substitute for the
original joint resolution.
The amendment was agreed to.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate
as amended, and the amendment was concurred in.
Mr. GRIMES. I ask that the joint resolution
as it now stands be read.
Thft resolution was read.
Mr. HARLAN. I will inquire of the Senator
who has the joint resolution in his charge the
necessity of the first clause of the committee's
amendment, which is in tnese words: "the Sec-
. retary of the Department of the Interior be, and he
is hereby, authorized to allow to the State of Wis-
consin five per cent, of the net proceeds derived
from the sale of the public lands within the State,
as provided in the act of Congiess approved Au-
gust 6, 1846.'" I desire to know if that law is
not still in foice, if Wisconsin is not now receiv-
ing the five per cent, of the net proceeds of the
sales of the publiotlands within the State under
the law as it exists.
Mr. HENDRICKS. Certainly the law of 1846
is in force, but the accounts of the State of Wis-
consin have been suspended in the Department
and no payments have been made for a number
of years because of the conflicting equities which
are provided for in this joint resolution. It is be-
cause of these questions, that cannot be adjusted
in the Department, that the State has had to come
to Congress for this relief. Payments are not in
fact being made under the law which gives to the
State of Wisconsin the five per cent.
Mr. HARLAN. If the State of Wisconsin is
now receiving the five per cent, of the net proceeds
of the sales of the public lands within its limits
under existing laws, there can be no ifbcessity for
reenacting that provision, and therefore I move to
strikeout all after the word" Interior" in the third
line of the amendment of the committee, down to
and including the word " and" in the seventh line.
Mr. HOWE. Let me suggest to my friend
from Iowa, that in the first place this amendment
having been adopted, it is scarcely amendable now;
but those first lines were introduced only for the
purpose of stating what the account is that is to
be settled.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is
of opinion that the proposed amendment is not in
order at the present time.
Mr. HOWE. If those words were struck out,
there would be nothing for the word " that" pre-
ceding " account" in hne eight to refer to. After
the words proposed to be struck out, the language
is " and shall in the settlement of that account,"
&c. It is a mere statement of the account that is
to be settled.
"Mr. HARLAN. I will state to the Senator
fi om Wisconsin what my object is, and then per-
haps be can frame an amendment that will meet
my view, if ho shall approve it.
If I understand this case it is about this: many
years ago a grant of land &as made'to Wiscon-
sin to aid in the construction of a canal; it was
stipulated in that act that the cSanal should be com-
pleted within ten years, and that if the canal
should not be completed within ten years the State
of Wisconsin should account to the Federal Gov-
ernment for the lands thus donated to the State,
it then being a Territory, at the rate of $2 SO an
acre. Subsequently the Territory of Wisconsin
became a State, and, under the provisions of law
then in force and at that time enacted,became en-
titled to five hundred thousand acres of land to
aid in carrying on works of internal improvement
aiici to five per cent, of the net proceeds of the
sales of the public lands made within the State
subsequent to the date of its admission. In the
settlement of the account since that period with
the State of Wisconsin the Commissioner of the
General Land Office has chaiged the State of Wis-
consin with the whole amount of the canal grant
at $2 50 an acre', and has been, and still is, de-
ducting tjiat amount from the sums, of money
which fall due to the State under the law granting
the State five per cent, of the net proceeds of the
sales of the public lands. I suppose this is right
with this exception, that Wisconsin ought not to
be charged more than ยง1 25 for the canal lands,
or only so much more than $1 25 an acre as she
may have received for these lands by their sale
in the market.
This joint resolution provides various other
things. It provides that the Commissioner of the
Gener.il Land Office shall state an account be-
tween the State of Wisconsin and the canal com-
pany, and ascertain how much money may be
due from Wisconsin to the canal company which
engaged m the construction of the canal under
the law of the Territory of Wisconsin, and after
ascertaining any amount of money that may be
due to that company from the State of Wiscon-
sin, to withdraw it from the Treasury of tile Uni-
ted States, and I believe it nmlces an appropria-
tion to pay it from the Treasury of the United
States. I object, as a member of this body, to
instituting any such commission. It is enough
fortius Government to do to administer the pub-
lic lands, to administer the laws of the United
States on that subject, as between itself and its
own grantees, without converting itself into a
kind of sheriff to stop in the Treasury any money
that may be due to the State of Wisconsin, for
the purpose of paying it over to the creditors of
Wisconsin. If Wisconsin is indebted to this
company, let Wisconsin settle with the company
and pay the company from its own treasury. If
the Government of tin United States is indebted
to Wisconsin, if in the adjustment of this account
under which Wisconsin is entitled to sums of
money from year to year the Government of the
United States is indebted to Wisconsin, let the
amount due be estimated on the public lands at
the usual rate, and let whatever may be due to
Wisconsin be paid over to the State, and not eon-
vert the office of the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office into that of an arbitrator to in-
tervene between the agents of the State ef Wis-
consin and the State itself to settle the conflicting
claims or disputed claims set up by these agents
of the State against the State of Wisconsin.
We now charge Wisconsin ยง2 50 all acre for
the land originally granted to the Territory to aid
in the construction of the canal. As that amount
of acres of land was not deducted from the sub-
sequent five hundred thousand acres falling due
to Wisconsin when Wisconsin became a State,
the Commissioner is now deducting the value of
the land at $2 50 an acre from the five per cent,
fund, and it is said that he"is compelled, under the
'lawus it exists, to charge $2 50anacre. I think
this is too much. I think $1 25 an acre, the or-
dinal y minimum price of the public land, is the
amount that ought to be charged to Wisconsin;
and that amount ought to be ^deducted from any
money that would otherwise be due the State. I
desire to reach that point, and 1 am not willing to
make an appropriation of any other moneys, of
any larger sum of money, nor to institute any
I commission to intervene between the agents of
! the State of Wisconsin and the State of Wiscon-
! sin itself.
Mr. HOWE. X think the Senator from. Ipwa
labors under a misapprehension, on .two points.
First, the act making the grant to the-TerHttfry
of Wisconsin did not require the State of Wis-,
consin to pay it back if the canal company did*
not build the canal, except upon the condition
that after the State was admitted into the Union โข
the Legislature of the State should assent to the
terms of the act, which the Legislature never bafh
done. When the Senator slates that this grant,
was mads on the condition tliat if. the canal was.
not made in ten years the State should pay back.
the money, he should remember that there was
also a condition that the Slate Legislature should
assent to that provision, which the Legislature
never did.
I think the Senator is mistaken upon another
point, in supposing that Congress intervenes here
to enforce a settlement between the State and the
canal company. The simple fact is that by the
amendment of the committee which has been
adopted, provision is made that a certain fund
which the Stateacknowledges she has in her hands
belonging to the United States or to the canal
company shall bedisposed of. The State simply
acknowledges that she has the fund; it belongs'
either to the United States or to the canal com-
pany, she does not know which; she is a mere
stakeholder. The canal company show that a
part or the whole of it belongs to them. The
amendment provides that the Commissioner of
the General Land Office shall determine how much
of this fund does belong to the canal company,
and as much as does belong to the canal company.
shall go to them and the balance shall be retained
in the Treasury. That is all there is of it. We
are mere stakeholders of a fund there, that we
are willing the proper owner shall have. Two
parties claim it, the United States and the canal
company. We allowthe United States officer to
settle with the canal company,and determine how
much if anything is due to the canal company.
These are the two points on which I think the
Senator was slightly mistaken.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I desire to add a word to
what my colleague has said, and to it especially
I call the attention ofiny friend from Iowa. The
ground which he has taken is the ground which
heretofore, during the time I have been in Con-
gress, wc have sometimes tuged upon the com-
mittees on this subject; that is to say, that the
State of Wisconsin ought to receive her five per
cent, from the Treasury, and if we owe anything
to the canal compyiy we arc able to pay, and we
can settle with them; but the committees here have
always replied to us by spying that we stood in
the character of a trustee holding this fund for the
canal company as a kind of cestui que trust, a,nd
that Congress were unwilling to pay over the
money to us without at the same time looking to
the equitable rights of the canal company, and
therefore it is a thing which is imposed on Wis-
consin that she shall submit to settle the claims
of this company against her. That is the truth
aboutit. Webelievedit would be better if our five
per cent, were paid over directly to the State, and
let us respond to all claims the company has upon*
us, legal or equitable, but the committees of Con-
gress who have had this matter in charge have
not been satisfied to let the matter stand in that
light, and therefore they have presented it in the
light in which it is now presented unanimously
by this committee. ' They have taken the ground
that Congress granted this land to the Territory
of Wisconsin as a trustee for the benefit of the
canal company. The real truth is, stripped of all
verbiage and ofall gloss that legislation has th rown
over it, that a certain set of men in the eity-of
Milwaukee desired to get up a canal to connect
Milwaukee with the Rock river, and they ap-
plied to the Legislature of the Territory of Wis-
consin in 1836 for a charter, and they did not
then succeed, but in 1838 they got a charter,and
they got a clause put into it that they might be at
liberty to apply to Congress for a grant of land.
The Territory of Wisconsin never applied for
this grant of land, but this interested corporation
did apply and did get Congress to make a grant
of land for their benefit, the grant being nominally
to the Territory to be expended for the company.
After some years it was found, in the estuna-
I tion of the people of theTerritory,that the whole
1 scheme of this canal was an impracticable thing;
it was a thing that could not be done. They
