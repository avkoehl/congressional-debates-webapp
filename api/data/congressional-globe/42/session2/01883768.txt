Mr. PRATT. The Committee on Pensions,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 2428)
granting a pension to Samuel Shaffer, late a
piivate in company I, seventy-eighth regiment
of Pennsylvania infantry volunteers, have in-
structed me to report it without amendment;
and I ask that the bill be now put on its
passage.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole,proceeded to consider
the bill, which is a direction to the Secretary
of the Interior to place upon the pension-roll,
subject to the provisions and limitations of the
pension laws, the name of Samuel Shaffer,
late a private in company I, of the seventy-
eighth regiment of Pennsylvania infantry vol-
unteers, and that he be paid a pension at
the rate of eight dollars per month from the
passage of the act.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
Mr. CARPENTER. The Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred the amend-
ment of the House of Representatives to the
bill (S._No. 473) to further the administration
of justice, have instructed me to report it
back with a recommendation that the Senate
disagree to the amendment and ask for a
committee of conference. I ask that that
motion be put now.
Mr. EDMUNDS. There is one subject which
ought to be considered in connection with that
bill, and it is contained in a bill which has
been referred to our committee touching the
holding of special sessions of the circuit courts
of the United States, which properly belongs
in that bill, and I had framed an amendment
on that subject. Perhaps by calling attention
to it now, as it is on the same subject, the
Senate would not think that the committee of
conference had transcended its duties by in-
corporating it. It is merely a provision which
belongs to this bill but is not specifically
named in it. Therefore, having called the at-
tention of the Senate to the fact that we all
agreed that whatever ought to be done on that
point ought to go into the amendments made
to the law by this bill, I presume the Senate
would make no objection if the committee of
conference should think proper to put it in.
Mr. CARPENTER. That is a provision
entirely germane to the bill itself and it ought
to have been put into it.
The House amendment was non-concurred
in, and a conference asked on the disagreeing
votes of the two Houses.
By unanimous consent, the Vice President
was authorized to appoint the conferees on the
part of the Senate.
CATHARINE CROWELL.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I am directed by the
Committee on Pensions, to whom was referred
the petition of Catharine Crowell, praying to
be allowed a pension, to report a bill and ask
that it be considered now.
There being no objection, the bill (S. No.
1149) granting a pension to Catharine Crow-
ell was read three times, and passed. It
directs the Secretary of the Interior to place
on the pension-roll, subject to the provisions
and limitations of the pension laws, the name
of Catharine Crowell, widow of William
Crowell, a private of company G eighteenth
regiment Kentucky volunteers, and to pay
her a private's pension from the passage of
the act.
ABIGAIL RYAN.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I am directed by the
same committee, to whom was referred the
veto message of the President of the United
States returning with his objections the bill
(S. No. 805) granting a pension to Abigail
Ryan, to report a new bill, which obviates
the objection ; and I ask that it be put on its
passage at once.
There being no objection, the bill (S. No.
1150) granting a pension to Abigail Ryan,
widow of Thomas C. Ryan, was read three
times, and passed. It provides for the pay-
ment of a pension of two dollars & month for
her minor child under sixteen years of age.

postponement, which was agreed to.
Mr. BOREMAN. I ask unanimous con-
sent to consider the bill (S. No. 527) to reim-
burse United States marshals for moneys ne-
