sundown, having driven the enemy's cavalry at least 3 1/2 miles. One man missing while crossing Stewart's Creek. At sundown we retired back across Stewart's Creek and encamped.

December 30, skirmished with the enemy all day on the right of General Johnson's division, driving the enemy's cavalry wherever they made their appearance, and retired and encamped in the camp occupied by us the night before.

December 31, at 7 a. m., I was ordered by you to take two companies and make a thorough reconnaissance up the creek in the woods on our right. After throwing out skirmishers into the woods, I received orders from you to withdraw my command as soon as possible, for the enemy were advancing in force on my left. I immediately withdrew at full speed, and passed the enemy's left (infantry) within 150 yards under heavy fire, slightly wounding only 1 man and 2 horses. After passing their flank half a mile, I discovered your brigade formed in line of battle in the corn-field on the opposite side of the creek. Being unable to join my regiment at this point, I proceeded down the creek half a mile and crossed, joining the brigade on the right (my regimental was on the left), retiring slowly in column of fours. After retiring half a mile, we were again formed in line of battle, and remained until we were under a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery, when we were compelled to retire. Here the brave and heroic Major D. A. B. Moore fell, mortally wounded. We then retired across a corn-field, the enemy in full and fast pursuit, with at least three times our number, when we again formed, receiving three heavy charges from the enemy's cavalry, but repulsed them every time with a fire from our carbines. Their artillery was still open on us. We then retired through the woods toward the Nashville pike, when we formed in a corn-field. The enemy (cavalry and infantry) immediately appearing, our noble commander, Colonel Minor Milliken, ordered our regiment, five companies, to charge them. Being unable to hold his position after the charge, he ordered the regiment to retire, when he received the fatal shot that killed him instantly. About this time Second Lieutenant Condit was killed, and our adjutant, First Lieutenant William Scott, fell seriously wounded. The companies then retired to the pike and crossed Stewart's Creek on the pike. I found myself in command, and repulsed the enemy, who had pursued to the creek and taken possession of our wagon train, killing 2 and wounding 4. At this time the brigade came across the creek and organized.

January 1, at 9 a. m., Major Laughlin reported for duty and took command of the regiment.
