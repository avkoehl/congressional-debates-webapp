HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 7, 1864-10 a.m.

Brigadier-General CRAWFORD:

General Hancock and General Burnside report the enemy have left their front. General Sedgwick finds none on his extreme right. The enemy is believed to be retreating, with only his rear guard in our front. General Griffin is going to push them with a heavy skirmish line near the pike. I wish you would do so without waiting for any connection right or left on your own front. Put in about 400 men, with flankers, so that you need not be surrounded if they fall back. Tell your men we believe the enemy is retreating, and make this demonstration at once.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD, May 7, 1864-10.20 a.m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: The movement indicated is in progress. About half an hour ago I ordered a few riflemen out to feel their way ahead of my skirmish line. They are now out. I have no report yet. There is still skirmishing on my right.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Third Division.
HEADQUARTERS LINE OF BATTLE,Near Lacy's, May 7, 1864-12 m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: The skirmishers sent out encountered the enemy about half a mile distant on the Parker's Store road. The enemy have a battery in the first open space about three-quarters of a mile from our position. The enemy advanced to meet my skirmish line. I have directed them to fall slowly back to their old position, without exposing the left of the line near First Division.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Third Division.
HEADQUARTERS LINE OF BATTLE,Near Lacy's, May 7, 1864-12.50 p.m. (Received 1.20 p.m.)

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have report from my regiment. The First Rifles and the Sixth Regiment were sent out, the latter acting as flankers to the former. They met the enemy's line of skirmishers a short distance this side of the open field; drove them in upon their supports and, finally, into their works, developing the enemy's line.
