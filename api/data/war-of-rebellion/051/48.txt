ATLANTA, October 7, 1863.

COLONEL: In my reply to your note of the 22nd, asking for the reasons of the failure to attack the enemy at daylight on Sunday, the 20th, there occurs this passage: "My orders were sent by courier to the headquarters of the respective generals-General Hill's to Thedford's Ford. The couriers to Generals Cheatham and Walker returned promptly," &amp;c. The memorandum from which that statement was made was furnished from the office of my adjutant-general, through whom orders are transmitted and received. On a careful examination of the facts since that reply was forwarded, I find that as the couriers were about to leave General Walker came to my camp and received his orders in person. The fact is not material, but as it is proper to have what occurred stated as it happened, the correction is made and this paper submitted as a supplement to my reply.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant Co. GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT.

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you will at once proceed with Cheatham's division and take position at Rock Spring. You will order forward also the rest of your corps as soon as practicable.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
