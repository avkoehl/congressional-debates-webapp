James Denison, being further duly sworn, saith, that when the Parsons returned to Sandwich there were not more than three persons on the dock; they appeared to be Canadians. I did not stay there more than fifteen minutes. They made me show them the injection pipes below, smashed one of them themselves and I cut the other. As I was going up street I saw ten or fifteen men and boys coming down. They were talking among themselves, but I heard little of what was said. The rebels, I thought, were talking about burning the boat; and one of these Canadians, a grayish-headed man, about forty years old, said they should not do it there. Soon after Campbell and I walked away, and one of the rebels walked with us to the head of the street. I did not see them take the piano from the cabin to the lower deck, but saw them take it on the dock. Did not see them injure the boat there, except to cut her pipes. Saw most of them walk away; some went up to Windsor with us, each with a bundle of plunder in his hands.

I told him if he would be at Detroit in the morning himself to let me know if the men were going the boat would stop and take them. I told him further that they could take no baggage, as there was no custom-house on Kelly's Island. The steamer Philo Parsons left Detroit on the morning of September 19, at 8 a. m., with about
