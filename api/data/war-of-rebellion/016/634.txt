General N. G. EVANS.

No. 161. Reports of Colonel W. H. Wallace, Eighteenth South Carolina Infantry, of operations August 23-30.

CAMP NEAR WINCHESTER, VA.,

October 17, 1862.

In obedience to orders form brigade headquarters I would respectfully report that the Eighteenth South Carolina Volunteers, on the morning of July [August] 23, in obedience to orders from Brigadier-General Evans, was marched to a point on the Rappahannock River near Rappahannock Station, and was formed in line of battle and marched to the base of a hill, upon the summit of which a battery was in position, which immediately engaged a battery of the enemy posted upon a hill nearly on front of the railroad bridge crossing the Rappahannock at that point. The Eighteenth, in its present position, was intended as a support for the battery in our front in the event of its being charged by the enemy. We remained in this position for a considerable length of time, and were subjected to a rather severe fire from the enemy's guns and sustained some damage. We were then moved in line of battle, by order of General Evans, up the hill and halted near the summit, still under a heavy fire. Here we remained but a short time and were marched by the right flank toward the position of the enemy, and while passing over the ground necessary to be traversed to reach the hill upon which the enemy was posted we were exposed to a very severe fire of shell, from which our loss was considerable. We reached the base of this hill just as a charge was being made upon it by other troops. This charge was repulsed by batteries of the enemy on the opposite side of the river, to which side what troops of the enemy that were on this side soon retired and burned the bridge behind them. While occupying the position at the base of the hill upon which the enemy had been posted a battery of the enemy was put in position on
