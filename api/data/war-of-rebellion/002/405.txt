No. 44 Report of Colonel William B. Franklin, Twelfth U. S. Infantry, commanding First Brigade, Third Division.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, THIRD DIVISION, Department Northeastern Virginia, July 28, 1861.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to make the following report on the operations of the brigade under my command in the action at Bull Run on the 21st instant:

The brigade consisted of Light Battery I, First Artillery, Captain J. B. Ricketts; the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment, Colonel Lawrence; the Eleventh Massachusetts Regiment, Colonel Clark, and the First Minnesota Regiment, Colonel Gorman. The Fourth Pennsylvania Regiment had been attached to the brigade until the morning of the 21st instant, and when the remainder of the brigade marched forward it marched to the rear. The brigade left camp near Centreville at 2.30 a.m., in the following order: 1st, Minnesota regiment; 2nd, Ricketts' battery; 3rd, Fifth Massachusetts Regiment; and, 4th, Eleventh Massachusetts Regiment. The Minnesota regiment was arranged with the two front companies ready to act as skirmishers; the next three companies as the advanced guard, and the remainder of the regiment formed the head of the column. The men were furnished with three days' provisions in their haversacks.

At Centreville a delay of more than two hours took place, to enable General Tyler's and Colonel Hunter's columns to pass Colonel Heintzelman's. The march recommenced, and continued without interruption
