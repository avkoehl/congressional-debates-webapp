JACKSON, TENN., July 30, 1862.

General McCLERNAND, Bolivar:

By the enemy being in force I mean cavalry force, though I understand that footmen were engaged against Major Stewart. I think it was citizens collected to support rebel cavalry.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, July 30, 1862-3.05 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Brigadiers scarce. Good ones scarce. Asboth goes on the month's leave you gave him ten months since. Granger has temporary command. The undersigned respectfully beg that you will obtain the promotion of Sheridan. He is worth his weight in gold. His Ripley expedition has brought as captured letters of immense value, as well as prisoners, showing the rebels' plans and dispositions, as you will learn from district commander.

ROSECRANS' HEADQUARTERS, July 30, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

A batch of captured letters just in throws a flash of light on the rebel movements. Bragg has gone to North Alabama; headquarters at Rome. Price commands in Mississippi; line extends from Tupelo, via Ripley and Salem, to Holly Springs. Villepigue, with seven regiments, is 10 miles below Grand Junction. Say they could take Corinth when they please. Expect they will leave and will soon occupy the Mobiel and Ohio Railroad, &amp;c. When I have finished, will send them to you.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

ROSECRANS', July 30, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I think it best to spare General Stanley at once. I think his purpose, if executed, will be beneficial to the service.
