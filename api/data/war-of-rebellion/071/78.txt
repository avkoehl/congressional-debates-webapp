(Received 9. 05 p. m.)

ALBANY, July 5, 1864.

(Received 9. 05 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Will you receive any men for less than 100 days? I should like such information about affairs as you can give with propriety.

HORATIO SEYMOUR.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 5, 1864 - 11 p. m.

Governor SEYMOUR,

Albany, N. Y.:

Thanks for your telegrams just received. It is not probable that your emergency troops will be required sixty days, perhaps not so long, as orders for concentration of other forces were issued some days ago in anticipation of a detachment from the rebel army for the purpose of raids, but it has been deemed best to extend the call for 100 days. There is still much uncertainly about the numbers of the rebel force. Taking all the evidence furnished by Generals Grant, and Sigel, it seems certain that Ewell's corps and Breckinridge's division are joined, and operating together in Maryland. Our forced still hold the Maryland Heights. Hunter is moving forward from Western Virginia. Nothing of importance has transpired before Richmond since Wilson's return, but siege operations are being pushed forward vigorously. General Sherman has not been heard from since the occupation of Marietta. To-morrow morning I will advise you more fully, as reports are expected by that time from different quarters.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
