General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: Accompanying you will find General Orders, Numbers 73, from these headquarters, organizing and designating the different brigades and DIVISION composing my command. * I most respectfully ask and recommended that the organizations as shown and the assignment to duty of the different offices may be made permanent. The permanent assignment of Colonels Rucker, McCulloch, and Bell to the command of brigades is made upon the efficiency and gallantry of those officers, all of whom have served faithfully in the respective positions they are assigned to, and I take pleasure in saying that upon all occasions I have found them fully competent to perform the duties developing upon them as brigade commanders. Hoping, general, that the organization as made by me may meet your approval, and the facts herein set forth concerning the officers mentioned above may have your consideration for permanent assignment and promotions,

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
