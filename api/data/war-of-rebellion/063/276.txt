HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,New Orleans, April 24, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Defenses of New Orleans:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward for your information copies of two telegrams just received, as follows:

BATON ROUGE, April 24, 1864-2 p. m.

The rebels are crossing westward; a captain and 13 men last night, some night before, and report of much larger force gong in a few days. I suppose the gun-boats keep everything very safe down toward New Orleans.

P. ST. GEO. COOKE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BATON ROUGE, April 24, 1864-2.05 p. m.

Some rebel troops have crossed the river westward, close above. More are reported to intend to do it in a few days. One gun-boat between Donaldsonville and Red River.

P. ST. GEO. COOKE,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

I am, very respectfully, general, your most obedient servant,

J. SCHUYLER CROSBY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,U. S. Transport Emma, April 24, 1864.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf:

GENERAL: I would respectfully call your attention to the condition of the command at Pass Cavallo, Tex. If attacked by the enemy in force, they would be compelled, owing to their diminished numbers, to abandon the outer line of defenses and fall back 3 miles into the inner line of defenses. Within this line there is only salt water. Their fuel is gathered from the beach 25 or 30 miles down the island, and even this poor supply is rapidly failing and would be cut off by an approach of the enemy. Fifty feet of bridging at the lower end of the island would connect it with the Mainland, affording easy passage for any amount of artillery and land transportation. The capability of the garrison enduring a siege would be determined simply by the length of time they could exist without water and fuel. If it is intended to hold this position, they should be supplied with condensers, and fuel both for condensers and the necessary camp use.

Hoping that this will meet with immediate attention, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General, Commanding.
