Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: The enemy has been unusually quiet to-day along the whole extent of his lines, and nothing of importance has occurred. Two divisions of his cavalry, under General Sheridan, are reported to have crossed the Pamunkey yesterday at New Castle Ferry, and to have encamped last night at Dunkirk and Aylett's, on the Mattapony. They were accompanied by artillery, ambulances, wagons, and beef-cattle.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
