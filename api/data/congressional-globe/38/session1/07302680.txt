increase of this bill, we pay as gratuity to one class
of persons the'enormous sum of §750,250,252.
' Will any ono- pretend that all this is for re veuuer
"What! when the tariff does not laise one tenth
of that sum on all articles of importation ! What,
then, is this §75(1,250,252 paid for? Not for war,
not for debts-, not" for expenses. Is it possible
•that we have to pay on some ten. articles only,
in paper money, 8750,600,000 to get less than
#50,000,000 of revenue from them? Mr. Hays,
comptroller of Chicago, with keen analysis once
showed that, by the .tariff acts of 1846 and 1857,
the people puid the startling sum of §338,000,000
to afford the Federal Government a revenue of
$54,000,000; and he prophesied that by the tariff
of, 1802 the loss to the community would be still
grbater. How much greater is apparent from my
calculations on the depreciated paper system and
the increased duties of 1862!
"What, then, do you propose? To abolish all
taiiffs?" Yes. God save the people from these in-
direct and insidious robberies! In their name let
such tariffs be abolished. Since you have begun
on internal taxation, let all our revenues be thus
levied, if you abolish the tariffof 1862, then, to pay
the other taxes, you give to the people an in-
creased ability to the amount of $750,250,252 on
the lew articles alone which I enumerated; and
how much more on all manufactured articles 1
Abolish your tariffs, and if your direct taxes are
unfair they are not unfelt, and can be speedily
corrected. Abolish your tariffs, and let every
interest stand undisguised before the law; the
farmer the equal of the manufacturer; the laboring
man the equal of the millionaire. "No mask of
industry over the features of capital; no unjust
discriminations; no despoiling one class of labor
under thepretense of stimulating another; noun-
healthy drugging of any one business by the
robbery of another.
But instead of mitigating you propose to ag-
gravate these oppressions. By your joint resolu-
tion the other day you have adued to these onerous
ratesot 1B(W fifty per cent. more. If this iu not to
be continued after ihe 1st of July, we are at least
to pay a large increase by the present bill. We
are expected, we of the West, to'pay our share
of it—as 1 shall show, the larger share'—without
murmur; because the war, instigated by the sec-
tion which reaps most of these gigantic sums
from our toil and sweat, demands our support!
Very well. For over two years we have sub-
mitted. But if we are to keep on patiently in
submission, a few years will see all our resources
sucked from us by these vampires of the East.
If tuxes mast be laised for war or for debts, to.
pay for the peculations of scoundrels or for the
patriotic service of soldiers,let them be levied di-
rcctly, fuiily, justly, that all may feel their oper-
ations, and the burdens, sufficiently great for a
whole people, may not be borne by a part, and
that part which is least able to boar them.
The people are the victims of the joint robbery
of a system of bountiesunder the, guise of duties,
and of a n inconvertible and depreciated paper cur-
rency uuilertbegiuse of money. Isit a cause of
wonder that the manufacturers accumulate wealth
so rapidly that they grow rich within a year if
they were poor before? This system is rapidly
building up an aristocracy, composed of manu-
factuiers and gamblers in irredeemable paper
money. In the same proportion it is impoverish-
ing the masses of the people. It is rapidly re-
ducing them to the same level of destitution and
degradation as that of the people of Europe.
Only here it is worse, for here it is in combina-
tion with a depreciated paper-money system,
which the aristocrats of Europe do not tolerate.
This combination is rushing the American people
along with headlong speed to inevitable ruin. In
the name of the laboring people of my district and
State, in behalf of those the results of whose tod
is thus torn from their families to pamper wealth
and arrogance, I protest against this system of op-
pression. In behalf of the poor men who woik
from day to day in shop and field, from whose
labor at last all these millions are wrung; ia be-
half of those who cannot and do not combine to
subsidize the press, fee lawyers, importune Con-
gress; who cannot afford to take their little all
from their families to pay sharp men for keen
deviccs to "cheat by statute;" in their behalf I do
challeng&thehonestyandjusticeofthese measures.
Mr. Chairman, no man is now so wise and gifted
ttjat he can save this nation from bankruptcy. I
believe the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Mor-
rill] himself expressed his belief in our ultimate
ruin. ' ,
Mr. MORRILL. I ask the gentleman to yield
to me to correct his remark, 1 made no prophecy
on the subject.
Mr. COX. I am glad.to be put right. I bo
understood him.
No borrowing system can save us. The scheme
of making greenbacks a legal tender, which ena-
bled the debtor to cheat his creditor, thereby play-
ing the old game of kingcraft, to debase the cur-
rency in order to aid the designs of despotism,
may float us for a while amidst the fluctuations
and bubbles of the day; but as no one possesses
the power to repeal the law of the Almighty,
which decrees (and as our Constitution has es-
tablished) that gold and silver shall be the stand-
ard of value in the world, so they will ever thus re-
main, notwithstanding the legislation of Congress.
Congress may make' paper the measure of prices
but it can never make paper the stan'dard of value.
Such a paper system in connection with this tariff
will, sooner or later, crush labor in this country.
What then? When our laboring masses shall
have become sufficiently impoverished by this
system will not the transition from a republic to
a despotism be easy? Will notthat phenomenon
of tyranny, the armed soldier accompanying the
tax-gatherer,occur here? Does not the question
of taxation, therefore, involve the problem of lib-
erty? Does notthis system, against which in its
every stage I have protested, involve an enormous
wickedness against the interests and happiness of
mankind?
The present tariff system has been devised for
the benefit of the manufacture^at>the expense
of the people, and yet it does not really aid the
Treasury. If it makes the rich richer and the poor
poorer, then by this concentration of wealth in a
few the less is the proportion of it which wilj be
paid into the Treasury. Sismondi, page 79, says
that all returns show that the great amount of
revenue is not paid by the rich, or even by the
middle classes, but by the poor and those just
above them. He holds that all attempts at tax-
ation on luxuries have failed in productiveness.
The state of the revenue depends mainly on the
power of the poor to purchase the necessaries and
comforts of life. Iience any system like this,
which aggrandizes wealth in a few, de.stroys the
great resources of revenue upon which we are to
depend at last for our credit and our safety.
Again, as many of the duties are prohibitory,
no revenue is derived from them, and the Treas-
ury again loses. The duties on paper, boots and
shoes, soap and candles, India-rubber fabrics, in
fact nearly all the articles named in the foregoing
tables, enjoy a monopoly in our market, while
in many instances the tariff of 1S62 permits cer-
tain articles used by the manufacturers to be im-
ported either free or at nominal duties. For in-
stance, rags, free; India rubber, raw, 10 per cent.;
lasting for ladies' boots and shoes and for soles,
10 per cent. In 1867, §904,842 worth of paper
rags were imported duty free. Those rags went
into manufactured paper, and upon that amount
of stock, duty fice, the paper makers were pre-
mitted to chaige their enormous profits. And so
with regard to other articles admitted with slight
duty for the benefit of the manufacturer.
When the manufacturer produces an ample sup-
ply of goods for the home market, and has a large
surplus for which he is compelled to seek amarket
abroad, it is just to exempt the raw material which
lie uses from duty, because he again cairies it out
of the country in the shape of manufactured goods.
In that tase, it operates so far as a drawback.
Such is the policy of Great Britain. But when
the manufacturer has the substantial control of the
home market, through the agency of prohibitory
duties, there can be no greater iniquity practiced
on the people than to permit him to taxhis enor-
mous pi oiit upon the very article which the Gov-
ernment admits duty free, or neaily so. Is it not
legalized robbery, more detestable in its enormity
than the actual crime? Yet the party in power
have inaugurated a tariff system which authorizes
and sanctions this very iniquity.
The estimates from which 1 draw these con-
clusions cannot be precisely accurate. It is not
assumed that they are. It is only claimed that
they are an approximation to the truth. The
most important elementof error is the basis of the
value of home manufactures in the census tables
of 1860, whether the actual cost or the price by
wholesale in market. Therefore, in order to state
the case in the most favorable form for the home
manufacturer, I will assume that upon the basis
of the depreciated paper currency of the United
States-their profits or bounties are at the rate of
100 per cent., or in the aggregate $497,729,900, or
$15 83 per head of the population of the United
States.
To recapitulate: rate of profit or bounty, reck-
oned upon the specie standard: $497,729,900, it is
#302,753,342 bounty,or $9 62 per head. Paper
standard: $497,729,900,' it is $750,250,252 bounty,
or $23 88 per head. Bounty at rate of 100 per
cent.: $497,729,900, it is $497,729,900 bounty, or
$15 83 per head.
It will be observed that the first estimate I make
upon the present tariff is on a spccie basis. On
this basis, the taxation, or tribute to the manufac-
turer, is at the rate of $9 62 per head. My second
estimate is made upon the same tariff and a paper
money basis depreciated in the ratio of $160 to
$100. On this basis the taxation or tribute is
$23 88,per head. My third estimate is upon the
basis of alio wing the manufacturer to pay a tribute
of 100 per cent. On this basis the taxation or
tribute is $15 83 per head. ^ These estimates are
embodied in the three following tables, from which
it will appear how the tribute ia levied upon the

Thus, it appears from the preceding tables
that the tribute which the eleven western States
pay to the manufacturers of the country, residing
mainly in the eastern States, in consequence of
the falsely called protective system and paper
money system of this country is as reckoned:
On the specie basis §99,582,414, or $9 62 per head.
u paper basis  244,713,728, or 23 88 "
" basis of 100 per
cent 60,193,151, or 15 83 "
Whole consumption of the articles of manufac-
turers named m the preceding tables three and
four, including cost and tribute or bounty, is as
follows:
Oil the specie basis,,      $25 45 per head.
