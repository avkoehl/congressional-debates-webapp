Senate.
neeted with th<- urnd t   n an 1 act or of ¡he pul up
Treasury
Indeed, it n -' but candid to sav that the com-
rnutee knew of no dn pet íelief v hich Congress
could properly afford to t íe distiess.es of the people
of the countn , h t su< h as should grow cut of the
existing connection be twee a the means of the Trea-
sury and the binning and meicantile interests
These bills cceifd all thit g < and, and no dif-
ference of opinion cou'd possibly exist as to them,
unless it should ans  upon toe principle of indul-
gence, or tne t me ot indulgence No such dif-
ference had bem manifested in the action of the
Senate upon the respective measure-, and theielce
it was right to asqiaif that none exited Some
had supposed that it was the dutv of Congress to
hoi row ¡he nine and on"-tnird nulhons, covered bv
the first hill, that it might be translated to the
States for safe-keeping, and piopos¡tion= having
that tendency had been presen'ed to, and acted
upon, by th  Senate, but they did not nvetviith
favor Tne bodv did not seem ti suppose that
such a disposit'on of the public credit would be a
measure ot Mief either to the &o\ eminent or the
people, and it was rejected
Take, then, the four measmes referred to sum
them up in their combined action, and to what do
they amount as relief to the community'2 The first
is equal to a forbearance to collect nine and one-
th rd millions of dollars from the custom-rs of the
banks and the merchants, to be transferred to the
States foi safe-keeping The thiee last authorize
a loan, upon the public ciedit, to the amourt ot ten
millions of dollars, to pay the expenses of the Go-
vernment and meet the public appropriations, and
a forbearance of the collection o{ that sum fiom the
public debtors, that they t >o may be able to for-
beai collections, at this t vmg period, from those
who are indebted to them Here, th-"n is direct
and positive reí ef ti the amount of nin teen and
one-third milhons of do'>ais Might he n< t, then,
ask, with some foice and some justice, w hether the
committee weie obnoxious to the chaise of having
forgotten the interests of the people n their caie lor
the Government? He would here dismiss this topic
The next and only remaining charge against the
committee which he proposed 'o notice was, that m
their action iVv had entirely overlooked, or
whouy leg tc  d to "cf upon, one of the >iiost, nay,
the veiy 1-1 ' i ip irtant of the subjects presented
for their "c > n the Message of the President re-

pubic Tieasury To- reasi sh.il been, and
still were, s-itisiact^n to hit is°lf, as h^ oi>b ed not
thev were to h's colleagues iron t'e comm t're,
but the coarse of action of the S><*na*e up n this oil!
seemed to indicatt, and its final action would pro-
bab'y show, that they were not satisfictcry to the
in ijoritj of tl e bodv Sh( u11 this be so, the com-
mittee would be conten', whin then leasons had
been nlaced iairly before the Senate and the country
Ihey found the Message presenting, among
others, two distinct points, train, m the j idgntnt
of tne committee, most deeply ímenVmg to the
public Treasury , the Govemmi nt, and the ci urdí)
The first was a continuance of the separ.m in be-
tveen the moneys of the people and IheStatc bank-,
which the operation oí íe existing lavs and the
conduct of the banks had ahead} produced The
other was a gradual and safe discontinuance ot the
<re->tion of the bills of the State banks inpayment
of tne public dues, and an eventual return t > tho
collection of gold and silver an 1 such pap i as
sh mid be issued upon the faith and credit cf the
United States, and be, bv the laws of Congress,
made receivable for debts due to the United States'
The laws as they are, upon the subject of the de-
pen e onl •i'c keeping of the pubic monevs
seemed to tl e (ominittee to re ¿ire immediate ac-
tion, if the recommendation of the President was to
be earned out and rmde a pirt of cur permanent
policy Hen e ihey reported to the Senate the bill
now tin ler discission Tnej were not unmindful
that some regnlat on "s to the descnptior s of cm-
reney to be recen ed in pivmert of the public dues
miobt become necessary, n ci'e the new system of
deposites should 1 e p lo *'(•& and the present condi-
tion of the banks should be changed, bin in the pre-
sent cond tion of the banks and of the law upon this
point, th"> could see no necessity for immediate
action, o> foi anv present change of the exiVin*
laws They fe t that the two subjects were some-
what t onuected, but not so mtimatelv as to require
or demand tint both should be embraced in the
same bdl Thev knew that great diversity of sen-
timent prevailed as to both, and that different opi
mens were held by those who had hitherto been
fuends ind suppoiters of the administration, as
well as between the n and their common political
opponents Under these circumstances, and with
the distinct exptession of a desire, on the part of a
large majoritv of the Senate, that the ptesent ses-
sion shou'd be terminated at tne earliest possible
dav, the committee felt bound to present every
subject from their hands in the most simple and
distinct form and in a snape which might receive
the definitive action of the body with the least pos-
sible consumption of time With tbis view
thev repo-ted separate bills upon every subject
upon which they did report, and the same
cons deration influenced them to omit re
pot's upon ill subjects which they supposed
might be deferred to the regular annual
session, without injury to any important interest,
public or private By the law, as it stards, the
notes of non-speeie paving banl • c^n neither be
recei ed in pav men' i f the public d ks ror pa d
to the pubhe cinlitors He w is ^orry to he com
pelled to sav that, 'or all pnctical purposes either
to the Government or the peop'c, thcic were, at this
tim , no other banks in the country, and he was,
much more -ony to be compelled to believe that
there would not, m a practical sense, be any such
banks until after the time when Congress would be
again in session No one had proposed, and he
was happy to know that no one would propose, to
make the inconvertible notes of non specie paying
banks receivable at the public Treasury, and surely
no one could have expected such a proposition from
the committee Th  levenues the l, to everv prac-
tieab'e extent ?re mw receivable mgold and silver
onh, unless Congress shall, at its present session,
creat  a piper upon the faith and ciedit of the Go-
vernmen , and make it receivable for the public
due^ Hence the absence of any immediate neces-
sity for legishtion upon this point The committee
further Leheved, what has alieady been proved to
be (rue, that any bill upon this subject would lead
to long and grave discussion, and tend to protract
the session Tor th se reasons they had omitted to
report upon tms subject, and he had as yet seen
nothtrg to clnnge his opinion of the wisdom of
their course He still believed that the connection
of th tw o subjects m tie same bill w as undesira-
ble th"!' it would retard action, and, be greatly
feared cmbimss the b 11 which t i<>eonmitt c hid
reiorted and the passage of which thev consideied
to be of high public importance The mat er,
however, was now with the Senate, and he should
cheerfully submit to its choice If called upon to
vote upon the propositions belore it, he was leady
to vote, whether they should be insisted u on as
amendments to the committee's bill, or a? an inde-
pendent measure
Having said thus much bv w < f explanrtion
and he hoped, to some extei f, jn ilcatun, of the
couise and adieu of the co-mmi tec, he w o ild now
pass to a bnef d scussion of the bdl b <bie the
Senate
The crisis, he said, was one of the deepest mte-
lest Everv man in these «eats, eveiy citizen of the
country, felt it to be so Still us peculiar charac-
ter could not be toi often adver'ed to, or too fitmly
fixed m the memory of all During a period of
profound peace, after a series of years of unexam-
pled abundance in every production of th   earth
and ev"iy product of labor, with a currency more
abundant than our voung country had ever before
witnessed and stanlng assnong m the public con-
fidence as our papei currency had ever stood, with,
readv markets, and prices higher than any former
period ol peace 1 ad sustained, under the influence of
all these elements fid evidences of prosperity and
wealih, national and h dividual, and at the entrance
upon another of those -ich and fruitful seasons with
which a kmd Providence =o inqueni y blesses our
fertile soil—a season not surpassed by any which
lias preceded it in tl e alum lance it has returned to
the husbandman tor Ins labor—at such a time, and
under such c rcu instances, the revu'sion came, and
in an listant, as mere—in a single night, the
whole beauty of this rich scene was changed That
cuneney,so pbundant and creditable, became de-
preciated, mconvertib e, and debased 1 hose mar-
kets, so quick and active, and profitable, became
stagnant and de-eited Those puces, ro alluring
to entei pri'e and industiv, w ere changed to a price-
less mass of unsaleable commodit e=
That all should have inquired after the causes of
this «ad and sudden change, was most natural
That statesmen ihouid have done so was necessary
to the discharge of their delicate and responsible
duties The President of the United States, to
qualify himself for the performance of his constitu-
tutional duty of giving to Congress " information of
the state of the Union, and recommending to their
consi leration such measures as he shall judgu ne-
cessary an 1 expedient," has done this In his
Message, he lias giveii to us his opinion of the
causes which have brought upon our country this
sudden and sweeping levn Is on It was not his pul-
póse to examine the correctness of these opinions of
the President No one had expiessed a doubt that
they w ere honestly entertained and all admitted that
they had been e'early, frankly, and firmly express-
ed T1 cy had been the subjec* of il le and extend-
ed ertcsci in the cruise of tins debate, and he
thongtit also the subject of ei ttally able and per-
fec ly triumphant de.ence Entertaining this opi-
n on, he had but a single remark to make in regard
to them, and that was, that he had heanl criticism
and contradiction from some quarters of the house
delivered m a manner and in language which ex-
cited his profound regret—in a manner and in lan-
guage which he would not, if he could, (and he
was most thankful he could not,) imitate, towards
friend or opponent
He had listened to the debate, however, with
profound attentior, and while all had their peculiar
views of the causes ot tne present derangement in
our monetary affairs, and while the v lews of the
different speakers differed matenally es to the
immedia'e and most active causes, he thought theie
were certain general positions substantially con-
ceded by all, which, being diawn out and placed in
their proper ordei, would advance us verv far in
tht w idf fiel 1 of discussion presented and occupied
by the various members He had endeavored,
the efore, to place these positions upon paper, and
to give th-m an older best calculated to promote
this objecf     lliev were as follows
1 That wide- pread and highly mjunous de-
rangements have been, and are experienced, in ihe
banking concerns, and 11 most ot the business
transactions of the counlrv
9 That the present emharrassriei 's in the affairs
of individuals are, to a gre-itei or less extent,
caused, oi gica'ly increased, by the existing embar-
rassments m the affairs of the banks
3   That an undue multiplication of banks by
manv of ihe State Iegislatuies,and excessive issues
of paper money by the State banks, are among the
most p'ommert of the causes which have biought
about these embarrassments of the banks, and con-
sequently of business generally
4   That a miternl enlargement of the specie
ba^is for our paper circulation, is indispensable to
the security of the banks, and t! e stability of the
piptrcuirency
■> Thai all banks of issie and circulation are
liable to e^ces^es, and t'nt the State banks, from
th-ir distant locations, riv al m'erests, and the varie-
ty nd diversity of their business and associations,
are peculiatly so Inble, wh'ch renders it desirable
and important that the fiscal action of this Govern-
