WM. HUNT, JR.,Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

Near Spanish Fort, March 28, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Army and Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: My command marched on the 17th and 19th instant. Have endured great fatigue and exposure, had have subsisted almost entirely on the prescribed field rations, as I have been able to obtain almost no cattle in the country. The field ration, in my opinion, when the men are undergoing great fatigue, unless fresh beef can be obtained, is insufficient. I find evidence of this in this command in flagging of energy and ability to undergo the labors well-fed men are capable of. The ration of whisky in case of great exposure seems to me also a matter of necessity. I have the honor to request that while we remain near our present locality, and while our means of transportation will admit, this command be furnished the field rations permitted to any troops in the field. The anxiety of the major-general commanding the army, that the morale of the troops be kept at the highest point of excellence, will, I trust, secure the orders necessary to keep the men in the best physical condition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General, Commanding.
