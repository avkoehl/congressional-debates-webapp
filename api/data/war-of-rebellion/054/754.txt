COWAN, October 27, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Muhlenberg's and Woodbury's batteries were loaded on cars to go to Bridgeport, under General Butterfield's orders, and it was afterward found he intended one battery of the Eleventh Corps and one of Geary's instead. I held them at Anderson until 2 o'clock this morning awaiting Moseley's arrival with the instructions, but Moseley did not reach me, and an engine having been sent from Stevenson to haul our batteries, I have brought them here. I find here the orders Moseley brought, which direct that these batteries shall go to Stevenson and Bridgeport. I cannot control the train only to Decherd. Shall I ask Innes for an engine to haul the batteries to Stevenson, or shall I unload here and send them by land? I do not think the horses can draw them over the mountain, and besides some of the wheelers cannot stand it. Will give further particulars hereafter.

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General.

Daily information confirms the belief that there are no rebels this side of Tennessee River, except scouting and foraging parties and bands of stragglers and deserters. I captured 12 guerrillas last night.
