So it seems that the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania was not expecting to push the consider-
ation of the French spoliation bill if an appro-
priation bill was before the Senate to-day, and
still beyond that Senate bill No. 2 was ex-
cepted. 1 had hoped, however, that the Sen-
ator would yield to the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania to make his adiiress on this question,
and then resume the consideration of the
appropriation bill.
Mr. CAMERON. The Senator from New
York is technically correct, buthe will remem-
ber probably that I said (though it does not
seem to haye been reported) that I supposed
the appropriation bills would be out of the
road, for 1 thought they would be by this time.
I said also that I should give way if an appro-
priation bill was up at any time, as I always
shall. I have desired from the beginning to
pass the appropriation bills at the earliest day,
so as to get them out of the road. They are a
clog on everything, they are a hinderanee to
all other business, because, they justly ought
to be passed early, and they would all have
been passed long ago if we had not had so
much discussion on minor parts of them.
The bill which I desire to bring up to-day,
and which I thought by unanimous consent
this day was allotted for, is one of vast import-
ance. It is to pay a debt due so long that
everybody seems to have forgotten his duty in
regard to it.
I felt very anxious at the beginning of the
session to make my own remarks on the sub-
ject. They will not be long, and I said so to
the Senate at that time, and then I was will-
ing to let the bill remain for some opportune
moment when I could bring it up; but the ses-
sion is drawing so near to what ought to be its
close, that I find I cannot do justice to the bill
by merely making my own remarks and then
letting it lie. I have no desire to make a
speech, and never have had on any occa-
sion for several reasons. The first is that I
never make a good speech ; at least I have no
taste that way. Bat I am exceedingly anxious
that the speech prepared by the Senator from
Maryland with great care, and as I believe-vvitli
great ability, giving the whole history of the
claims, should go before the Senate and before
the world. I am equally anxious that the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts should make his
speech upon the subject, because he has been
more conversant with it than any other Sen-
ator now here. I feel satisfied, too, that if I can
bring the- remarks of those two gentlemen
before the Senate we shall pass the bill ; and
I shall be very proud indeed if among the last
acts of my public life here I can do justice to
such a meritorious class of people.
This is different from all other claims before
this country. We have received the money;
we have it in our Treasury, and the claims
remain in the hands of the descendants of the
original claimants. As far as I understand
there have been no sales. These people to the
third generation, having faith in the Govern-
ment, have held these claims. Many of them
are poor; nearly all of them are very poor
indeed, and yet they have relied upon their
country, which did them a great wrong seventy
years ago.
I thpught that while gentlemen had perhaps
not given as much attention to this subject as
1 have myself, everybody had such an idea of
the history of these claims that when the time
came to act, at least they would give us a day
to consider the subject. I having nothing more
to say, but I shall at some opportune moment
press it.
Mr. COLE. Now I trust we shall get at the
deficiency bill, and that we shall finish it before
we adjourn to-day.
Mr. NYE. Will not the Senator from Cali-
fornia let me secure the passage of a bill?
Mr. COLE. It is the intention of Senators,
some of them at all events, to stay by until
this bill is disposed of to-day. I hope there
will be no difficulty about a quorum during
any period of the consideration of this bill. I
trust now the Senator from Mississippi, if he has
anything further to say, will not yield.
