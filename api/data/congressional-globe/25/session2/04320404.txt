CONGRESSIONAL GLOBÉ.
relation tó quite another subject. We all knew
how easily excitements were gotten up, and how
difficult they were to allay. As the chairman of
the Committee on Indian Affairs "was not now in
his seat, he would suggest that it be permitted to
he over informally, or on the table, for the present
It could then be called up at the will of any gen-
tleman disposed to do so.
Mr WEBSTER said he felt persuaded that those
who knew him, knew that no personal or political
reasons could have led him to the course he had
pursued There were no grounds on which to pre-
sume such motives His sole object was merely to
fulfil his duty to the country and to his own con-
science The Senator from Alabama seems to
treat the subject as an excitement gotten up for po-
litical effect. For his own part, he had no such
purpose, nor did any such feeling exist m the minds
of those lie repicsemed In moving to refer it to
the Committee on Indian Affairs, he was
anxious to see if something could not be
done. It was his wish to treat these Indians with
justice and kindness, and to convince the people of
the United States that it was our deteimination to
do so. Many excellent and worthy men had it in
their consciences on then pillows, that some great
wrong had been done to the Cherokeesin the treaty
of Echota. For this reason it was that he desired
something to be done, which might disabuse them of
this impression If gentlemen desired to give them
more time, he was satisfied For his part, he was
ready to give them more money, not so much on
their own account, perhaps, but would do it to satisfy
the people that we have done nothing that justice
and humanity would not warrant.
Mr CUTHBERT observed that nothing could
possibly be more unfortunate, considering the con-
duct of the people of Massachusetts to the abori-
gines within her borders, and the course of her re-
presentatives here, than his reference to their con-
sciences The gentleman said that the "consciences"
of his constituents told them that wrong had been
done to the Southern Indians. Where were the In-
dian tribes which once covered the territory of
Massachusetts? Where slumbeied the consciences
of the people ot Massachusetts when these Inbes
were exterminated by them'' Yes, sir, butchered'
Were their consciences to be aroused for the first
time now, after the bones of the slaughtered led
men m their borders had crumbled into dust, and
when a case had occurred of which they knew
nothing, and with which they could hive nothing
possibly to do? To satisf) their consciences? Who
were these men whose consciences were so tender?
Were they the men of tender consciences who
would let loose all the horrors of abolition in the
Soulhern States? Were they the men who, after en-
deavoring to excite a war of extermination between
the black man and the while man, would now pro-
ceed to let loose the red man1 We have, said Mr
C. the certain and unchangeable feeling that any
attempt toanest the execution of this treaty will be
followed by scenes of violence and bloodshed, at
the very contemplation of which the heart sickens,
and yet these men talk about their consciences, and
their desire to protect the weak and the ignorant,
while they are seekmg to produce them God of
Heaven' how aie terms abused' Conscience' mer-
ciful God' for men to talk of conscience while their
course lead-, lo violence and bloodshed
Mr PRESTON said he had heard the message
from the President, propos-ing new arrangements
with the Cherokees, with unfeigned surprise and
regret He had hoped that this painful and com-
plicated matter had ken finally put at rest, by a
determination on the part of the Government to go
on with a slow, cautious, but steady pace, in the
course prescribed to it by iitcessily The Cherokee
tieaty was, m his judgment, wisely and humanely
ratified The same wisdom and humanity demand
that, as far as the removal of the Indians is invol-
ved, it should be firmly carried into effect Hes -
tancy and further agitation can produce nothing
but ill. The rights of the States and of then citi-
zens have been recognised and established, and
shoald not again be disturbed On this matter
gentletren from the States interested are entitled to
lead They know best what is best for them I
ihall acquiesce la what they suggest    Nothing but
my deference for them prevents me from at once
moving to lay this message on the table, for the
purpose of trying the sense of the Senate as to its
further discussion The execution of the treaty is
intrusted to a gallant officer, not less distinguished
by his moderation and discretion than by his bra-
very and military skill. Whatever humanity and
prudence exact maybe expected at his hands. The
Indians must go, any interference here endangers
them As to money,lands, &c give tliem as much
as you choose, but do not further suspend ths just
claims of the States, or further lrutate their already
exasperated feelings I hope the gentlemen inte-
rested will not permit the proposition for postpone-
ment to be drawn into discussion, but that they
will put an end to it by a motion to lay on thetable
Mr CUTHBERT observed that he omitted to
notice, when last up, one impoitant fact, which he
would now call the attention of the Senate to But
for the ratification of this treaty, two years ago, the
State of Georgia would herself have dispossessed
these Indians of the territory on which they ought
not to have remained For two years Georgia had
passively 5 íelded and suspended the operation of
hei laws, under the full belief that this treaty would
be faithfully earned into effect But just at the
critical moment, on the 'sery day that it was to be
executed, it was proposed lo arrest it, and to con-
sult the State of Georgia too, 700 miles off, aftei
she had already waited two } ears He would vote
for laying this communication on the table, not to
be taken up again
Mr WEBSTER stood on peculiar ground, it
seemed, and he found it necessary to defend htm-
self. Here was a communication from the Presi
dent, deemed by him important to be commumca
ted to the Senate If there was any thing m that
document which could have drawn forth such
strange ejaculations, he thought they might as well
have been directed against the source from which
it emanated He would not reply lo the animad-
versions of the Senator, much less would he go
back lo Ins ancestors lo trace the wrongs which
have been done to the red man, they were sulh
cientlv numeious, he dared say The mere object
he had in view when he moved to refer it, was
that it should receive the respectful attention the
importance ot the subject demanded
Mr CALHOUN piesumedthat the object of the
Executive, in making this communication to Con-
gress, was to endeavor, if possible, to remove with
then ow n consent that portion ol the Cherokee na-
tion who were yet unwilling to go The object was
a very important one, and one that was exceeding-
ly desirable. He feared, however, the conse-
quences to which the gentleman from Georgia al-
luded. The business of removing these Indians
wilh their own consent, would be a very diffi-
cult one, but to remove them without it, would
be much more so He supposed that if
any plan was effected by which further
time was allowed, that the emigration "hould
at least commence, and then it might pro-
gress at fast as. circumstances permitted. Cer-
tain it was that no such arrangement could be m ule
unless with the concurrence of theSenatois of the
States interested, but if it could be the arrange-
ment, would save some hundred of thousands of
dollars But it was important, however, that the
emigration should commence at oncem good faith,
and progress as fast as circumstances would allow,
He was not prepared to say whether there was any
practicable plan that could be devised to satisfy all
parties, but he thought that a reference of the sub-
ject to the proper committee would be the easiest,
was as ascertaining that fau One of the member 
of thi committee was a representative from one of
the States concerned, and moreover ths import-
ance of the su ject deserved a reference
Mr CLAY of Alabama thought it wou'd be bet-
ter to let the subject lay on the table lira day or
two As regarded the mo hfication proposed by
the Senator fron South Carolina, it was totally un-
necessary, as the Commanding Genewl was fully
aut! onzed to effect the removal in a manner the
most fa /orable to the Indians He was not to
force them off all at once, but gradually, and as
fast as the nature of circumstances would permit,
without subjecting them to injury and loss
Mr. CUTHBERT said if there had been any
fair attempt on the part of Mr. Ross to arrange the
-difficulties, he had no doubt they would long since
have been arranged, but instead of that, this man
had remained here creating prejudice, and excite-
ment for his own selfish and ambitious purposes
If he had gone home to his people, while the fate
of his nation wis on the balance, and from thence
have made his appeals, there might have been le<3
reason to impugn his motives.
Mi KING observed that no motion was neces-
sary to lay the papers on the table They could
remain there without any further order, until it
should be thought propel to call them up.
The documents were then, by gereral consent,
laid on the table
