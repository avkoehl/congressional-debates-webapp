Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a letter from Brigadier General John Gregg, relating to the condition of the Texas brigade, to the command of which he was recently assigned, and to ask for the suggestions he makes your attentive consideration.

I am, with great respect,

M. D. GRAHAM.

[First indorsement.]

FEBRUARY 24, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

What do you advise on these suggestions? If the two armies were brought together I should favor it. Suppose you consult General Bragg.

J. A. S.

[Second indorsement.]

MARCH 11, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to the Adjutant and Inspector General.

The brigade of General Gregg (once General Hood's) is composed of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Texas and the Third Arkansas Regiments. I suppose the other brigade alluded to is General Smith's, in the Army of Tennessee, composed of the Sixth, Seventh, Tenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-fifth Texas Regiments. The consolidation at this time would seem to be impracticable.

SAM. W. MELTON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
