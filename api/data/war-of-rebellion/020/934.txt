this harbor and materially reduced his land forces in this immediate vicinity, on the requisition of the commanding general in North Carolina I returned Cooke's brigade of North Carolina troops in Wilmington and sent Clinghman's brigade there in exchange for Evans'.

A week ago, under your orders, I put in motion for Jackson, Miss., two brigades, under Brigadier-Generals Gist and W. H. T. Walker (the former commanding South Carolina and the latter Georgia regiments), somewhat over 5,000 infantry in all and two light batteries of the best class in the department.

Your orders have been based apparently on the conviction that the troops of the enemy assembled in this department for operations against Charleston have been mainly withdrawn and diverted to other expeditions-in North Carolina and the valley of the Mississippi. This conviction I regret I cannot share, as I am satisfied from the reports of district commanders and from other reasons that there has been really but little reduction of the command of Major-General Hunter.

General Walker, commanding at Pocotaligo, reports that on yesterday the outposts of the enemy in his front had been much in creased in strength. General Hagood reports them to be occupying Seabrook Island with at least 2,500 infantry. They are erecting fortifications at that point, as also on Folly Island, which is likewise still occupied in force.

Five of the monitors remain in the North Ediston, with some twenty gunboats and transports. With these and the transports still in the waters of Port Royal an the forces which I am unable to doubt are still at the disposition of the enemy he may renew the attack by land and water on Charleston at any moment. Acting on the offensive and commanding the time of attack, he could simultaneously call troops here from North Carolina and sooner, he could simultaneously call troops here from North Carolina and sooner than my command could possibly be re-enforced from any quarter out of the department.

To meet or resist any land attack there would be available-
