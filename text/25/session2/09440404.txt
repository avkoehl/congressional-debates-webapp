APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Covg""2nd Sess.
ceived this, must inevitably admit that there is a
similai distinction between money m the Treasury,
in the actual possession of the Government, which
can be sees, touched, counted, and used, an i a
debt or liability fiom the banks to the Government,
which maj or may not be paid, according to pro-
mise and contract, on demand Many an honest
creditor, by the story oí his disappointment and dis-
tress, a tale of real life without the embellishment
oí fiction, can readily and easily explain the diffe
rence between receiving money diawn out of the
Treasury and paid to him by a responsible anc1
authorized officer of Government, and receiving a
diaft upon an insolvent or suspended debtor bank
employed, because there is a positive injunction
against taking any money out of tht Treasury but
to meet appropriations made by law
Í have also -ndeavored to show that this Trev
siuy, which is thus to hold the public money, must
necessaril), if it accomplish it-, intended purposes,
be «holly created and solely governed by theautho
nty oí the United States Those \ ho are required
to place money in a Treasury, and to 1 eep it there
securely without being used by themselves or
otheis t it any purpose, until wanted for a specific
object, and are then bound to produce it, must, in
the very nature of things, not only have iccess to
this Treasury, hut must also, to thp e tire exclu-
sion of all others, have the entire possession and
contro out Now, sir, bank officers rnd directors
ana stoc^nolders do not correspond with this de-
scription of persons, and the banks do not, and can-
not, constitutionally, constitute such a Treasury as
I have described
A mere direction to deposite the public money
in the banks does not, ipso facto, convprt them into
the Treasury The act of Congress does not cre-
ate them, cannot increase or diminish theirpowers,
and cannot rightfully stipulate for the performance
ot any service repugnant to their charters It will
hardly be argued that Congress has power directly
and peremptorily to require the banks to receiv ,
to keep, to transfer, and to disburse the public
money—to prescribe, by law, the manner in which
these duties shall be performed, and "to punish for
tefusal, failure, or neglect Sir, I hazard nothing
m expiessing the opinion, that no man will mam-
tain that Congress can compel the banks to become
the depositories of the revenue If there be no
substantive power, which can beincctly exercised
to compel the banks to perform these duties, then
the authority to accomplish the same end circuit-
ously, byfinrhrept means and by contrivance, must
be derived by unfair interpretation If Congress
does truly possess the power under th  Constitu-
tion, to devolve this duty on the banks, then it may
legitimately carry it in.o execution, ind may adopt
coercive measures Not only does the Constitution
expressly authorize the passage of all necessary
and proper laws to carry into execution a granted
power, but it is the very essence of law to exact
obedience A law is a rule prescribed, which must
be obeyed—it enjoins dutj, and may compel per-
formance—it speaks to command, and not to par-
ity—and a want of approbation cannot render a
law, enacted in pursuance of the Constitution, nu-
gatory, or justify disobedience on the part of those
o whom it is addressed If a sanction cannonbe
annexed—if a penaltly cannot be enforced, then it
is clear that there is a want of Legislative autho-
rity to command what it proposes to be performed
In other words, an evident and acknowledged ma- ,
bility to enforce compliance, to compel perform-
ance, is conclusive proof of the non-existence of
the power As then Congress cannot constitution-
ally impose fine and punishment on these corpora-
tions and their officers, for refusing to keep the
public money, for failing to keep it safely, for de-
clining to transferor disburse it, for neglecting to
refund it when required, or even for embezzling it,
it would seem idle to discourse about the existence
of any substantive or efficient power to prescr be
in discharge of his claim Such an one knows and
feels the difference between the receipt of money
and the receipt of a bill drawn on another for
money A debt due and unpaid, is not money in
possession This delusive idea, that money depo-
sited in bank is in possession of the Government,
is dissipated by a positive enactment of Congress
Independent Treasury—Mr. Drorngoole.
at the late extra session This act rests upon Ine
existing facts of the case, and not upon the hyp0"
thesis of the deposite system
[Mr Dromqoolb here introduced and read to
the com-mttee the act of Congress passed October
16th, 1837, and entitled "An act for adjusting the
remaining claims upon the late deposite banks "]
Here, sir, is an admiss on of the fact, which the
deposite system endeavors to conceal and mistify,
that the public deposites in the banks are notpubhc
monej in the Treasury This act recognises them
as debts due to the United States from those insti-
tution1, it extends indulgence to them, and it exacts
mteiest tor delaying payment It is c i utter ab-
surdity to assert that the same iden'ical money is in
the Treasmy, and at the same time an unavailable
or unpaid debt It is defaming the Constnution
to charge it with giving sanction or c )unt°nancc to
such inexplicable contrad etions—such irreconcila-
ble inconsistencies
Next in the order of impeachment, Mr Chan-
man, I am to make good the charge, that this
union of th" banks with the Government tenihi to
defeat the «bject designed by t, *, frameis of the
Constitution in substituting a Hired power to raise
revenues in place of the indirect mode of making
requisitions on the States It is unnecessary to de-
tain the comrmltpe with a history of the rcquis -
tions made by Congress, under the articles of con-
ledeiation, on Jie different States of the Union,
with an e unt of the delay or failure of the
States, in many instances, to comply, or with ex-
planations of the insuperable difficu'ties, indeed
the acknowledged inability, of Congress t  enforce
compliance The principles of legislation for
States or Governments, in their corporate or collec-
tive capacities, as contradistinguished from the in-
dividuals of whom they consist, was pronounced
by the writers of the day to be the "great and radi-
cal vice" of the existing confederation. The nar-
rative of those times, the current essays, and the
solemn debates, mconteslibly prove that the correc-
tion of this radical vice was a powerful and lead-
ing inducement m the formation oí the present
Constitution So thoroughly penetrated were the
fiamers of the Constitution, and the American
people, with the conviction of the necessity of dele-
gating to Congress a power of raising revenue,
separate from and independent of the States, in or-
der that that body might presarve the public faith,
comply promptly with all engagements entered into
in behalf of the United States, and execute effi-
ciently all acts requiring an appropriation of mo-
ney, that they consented, m this particular, to give
the Government of the Union a National instead
of a Federal aspect
Congress was, iherefore, authorized to apply the
revenue power directly to the persons of the citi-
zens, relieved from any dependence on the States,
as communities, in their corporate character, and
exempt from the embarrassments and difficulties
of their intervention The principle introduced is
that of obtaining the necessary revenue by acts of
legislation operating upon individuals, the object
was to secure to the Government the appionnate
application or use of this revenue to its wants,
without dependance on corporate bodies The prin-
ciple will ha\ e been introduced m vain, if, after
the collection of the revenue, it may be returned
to the States under the name of deposites, by which
operation Congress is again reduced to " depend-
ance on them, and compelled again to resort to
the aband med system of requisitions And is not
the principle violated in a twofold degree by a
dependance on banks, by creating the necessity of
making requisitions on corporate bodies, which are
but the creatures of the corporate authority of the
States? The case is too clear for argument, that
in. both instances the principle is violated, and m
both instances the object is defeated These cor-
porations may delay or decline compliance with
the requisitions of the Government—may refuse
to pay the bills of Government drawn on them—
may deny to the Government the use of its own
revenue The pitnotism, the public spirit, the
sense of justice which resides m corporations, is a
sorry and an unsafe reliance for the support of
Government. Suppose they lock up the revenue,
suppose they refuse to yield it up for ever, or for
H. of Reps.
I a time, m peace or in war, where is the remedy
against their contumacy , where is the relief from
this miserable dependance? Por the present, I
onh raise the question of remedial action—I do
not go into a discussion of its feasibility
Mr Chairman, I am sincerely convinced that a
Government made, by it  organization, dependent
on corporations is fundamentally  defective and
I imbecile, it the agents, entrusted wilh itsadmjnis-
I tration, voiur tmly reduce it to such a dependance,
I they are faUhless to their charge    Sucha depen-
j dance, especially in matters of revenue, is incom-
patible  with the   very idea o! government    A
Government does not exist m its full constitutional
health end v gor, which depends, for its supplies,
I on th  contingent will of a corporation *
The next count in the bill of miictmentwhichl
i haie pre'ened, charges the scheme under exaau-
¡i nation nil exercising powers not granted in the
i coupact It usurps a power, no where granted,
| oHoan  gout the public money The Constitu-
I ticn d es not and, for wise reasons, ought not, to
confer on Congress the authority to lend money,
"To borrow money, on the credit of the United
I S'ate ," is expressly authorized, but no permission
of th- converse operation is to be found in the enu-
meration of grants to Congress To loan public
money is not necessary or proper for carrying into
execution any vested power, and cannot be regard-
ed as of indispensable implication The power to
loan money implies the right to levy and collect
an excess of revenue beyond the necessary and
appropriate wants of the Government Applica-
tions for loans would greatly multiply the induce-
ments to superfluous, unjust, and oppressive tax-
ation. A desire to negotiate loans from the Go-
vernment, urged under the pretext of promoting
the public good, would enlist a host of expectants
and applicants, and would combine an interest m
favor of surplus revenues, which would ultimate-
ly prove irresistible and overwhelming Among
the most eager and importunate in their solicita-
tions for the use of the public money always, as at
present, will be seen the corporations of the coun-
try Deficiencies of the revenue appear to hare
been contemplated as of probable occurrence, and
hence, very properly, the power "to borrow mo-
ney" i* expressly granted, and made permanent;
but the idea of a surplus revenue of taxation be-
yond the necessary wants and consumption of Go-
vernment, seems to have been cautiously excluded
from any place m the Constitution We search
in vain for any semblance of the power to lend
public money The evident danger of abuse and
oppression, by inordinate taxation, for the purpose
of granting loans to favored individuals or asso-
ciations, vindicates the wisdom of withholding such
a power, and impresses, with certainty, the con-
clusion that nonesuch could possibly have been
contemplated A total absence of all authority to
lend the public money, in any form, ought to fur-
nish some security that taxation would be restrict-
ed to the simple purpose of appropriation Unless
loan and appropriation are synonymous, or con-
founded, the restriction of the money m the Trea-
sury to appropriations is an exclusion of its em-
ployment in the business of loans
Having ascertained, as I think, incontrovertibly,
that "to lend money" is the exercise of a power not
granted in the compact, it remains, m regular ol-
der, to inquire whether the depssites of the public
money with the banks are, m fact, loans It has
been previously demonstrated that these deposites
are not money actually in the Treasury, but are debts
•ue from the banks to the United States To un-
dertake, in addition to this, to demonstrate further
that these debts are the result of moneys advanced
or loaned, would be clearly to supererogate It
would be the useless employment of adducing tes-
timony in proof of a notoriously self-evident fact.
