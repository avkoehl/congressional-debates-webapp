HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, June 1, 1863.

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

Washington, D. C.:

PRESIDENT: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated May 27, explaining the reasons which induced you to make a change in the command of this department, and your wish as to the principle which shall guide me in the discharge of my most difficult and important duties. I shall not fail to carry out your wishes to the fullest extent in my power, and shall be thankful for such instructions and advice as you may at any time be pleased to give me. The most serious difficulty I shall have to overcome will arise from the differences to which you allude between the factions into which the Union people are unfortunately divided. It shall be my highest aim, while keeping aloof from either faction, to reconcile their differences so far as my influence should extend, or at least to so conduct my administration as to give neither any just cause of complaint.

I have strong hopes that the Missouri State Convention at its approaching session will adopt such measures for the speedy emancipation of slaves as will secure the acquiescence of the large majority of Union men. If this hope be realized, one of my most embarrassing difficulties will be removed, or at least greatly diminished.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
