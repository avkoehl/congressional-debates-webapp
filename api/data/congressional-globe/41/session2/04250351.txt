1870.1
appendix to the congressional globe.
351
41st Cong....2d Sess.
Appropriations for the Navy—Mr. Morgan.
Ho. of Reps.
Naval Register shows only twenty-seven. Esti-
mate is made for the pay of retired command-
ers to the number of sixteen ; page 90 of the
Naval Register shows only fourteen. Estimate
is made for the pay of retired masters to the
number ofsix ; theliegister shows that only five
are retired. Estimate is made for one retired
midshipman ; one was retired, but after his
retiracy he was promoted to be a commodore,
but is since dead. Estimate is made for re-
tired surgeons to the number of twenty-five;
the Register shows only twenty-three. Estimate
is made for the pay of four retired assistant
surgeons; the Register shows that only three
are retired. Estimate is made for eight retired
chaplains; the Register shows only seven.
Showing beyond successful contradiction that
an appropriation was asked for four hundred
more naval officers than are in the service.
I lay these facts before the House in good
faith; and in good faith I invite investiga-
tion.
Mr. Chairman, Inowsubmita carefully pre-
pared table showing the amount of pay that is due
to the Navy, according to the estimate of the
Secretary of the Navy, and the amount re-
quired, as shown by the Naval Register. This
table has been compiled with great labor and
care, and for its accuracy I stand responsible to
the House and the country :

' Graduates.
I" Undergraduates.
It is just to say that all the errors in these
estimates are not excesses; there are some
underestimates. In this table, in both cases,
the true amounts are carried out. The result
in this table is arrived at by the same method
of calculation as that adopted by the ]N'avy
Department. There are three grades of pay
in the active service : first, pay for sea duty;
second, pay for shore duty ; third, pay for those
who are on leave ; fourth, pay for those on the
retired list. In order to ascertain the average
amount necessary to be appropriated, the sal-
aries of the first three grades are added to-
gether and the sum divided by three. This is
what the estimates of the Navy Department
pretend to do but do not do. I do not make
II any personal charge against the Secretary of
|j the Nav}', who is said to be a genial-hearted
jj gentleman, against whom personally I wish to
J say nothing. I am talking, not against indi-
ji viduals, but against abuses.
!j Let us consider some of the overestimates ot
| the Department in reference to salaries. The
Navy Department estimates for the Vice Admi-
