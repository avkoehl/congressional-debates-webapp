library op congress.
Mr. MORGAN. I present the annual re-
port of the Librarian on the condition of the i
Library of Congress for the year ending Decern- 1
ber 1, 1867, and I am instructed by the joint
Committee on the Library to offer the follow-

petitions and memorials.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
will present, by unanimous consent, a memo-
rial from a committee of several counties in the
State of Arkansas, setting forth the utter des-
titution of the people in several of those coun-
ties, and fearing in consequence of it that there
will be an outbreak and violence there. This is
a memorial directed to the Governor of that
State and by him transmitted to the Presiding
Officer of the Senate. As it is not addressed
to the Senate it does not come within the rule,
I believe, but by common consent it will be
laid before the Senate and referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia,
if there be no objection.
The paper was so referred.

ordered to lie on the table, the Senate having
acted on the subject.
Mr. SHERMAN. I present a number of
memorials from members of the bar of differ-
ent counties of the northern district of Ohio
remonstrating against the passage of the bill
now pending in the Senate to provide for hold-
ing annually two terms of the district court,
one in Cleveland and one in Toledo. As this
subject is before the Judiciary Committee I
move the reference of these memorials to that
committee.
The motion was agreed to.
