HEADQUARTERS, &C.,

Charleston, August 2, 1864.

Captain H. WEMYSS FEILDEN,

Greenville, S. C.:

CAPTAIN: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 29th ultimo, relative to the defense of the upper districts of the State, which communication, together with a letter on the same subject from Major Perryman, post commandant, has been duly considered by him.

Major C. K. Huger, acting chief ordnance officer of the department, has been directed to send to Major Perryman whatever ammunition can be spared for the purposes indicated. He reports that 100 Austrian rifles, with accouterments, and 5,000 cartridges have been this day dispatched to Greenville.

The commanding general regrets that he is not able at this time to furnish any troops for the defense of this section of country. The number of troops at his disposal in this department is so small that it is impossible to detach any of them from their important duties on the coast. Major Perryman will have to depend upon the local troops under his command, and it is hoped that the arms and ammunition which have been sent him will render them efficient for the defense of their homes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
