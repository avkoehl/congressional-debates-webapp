the enemy presses you draw in the men from Webster and concentrated the company at Potosi. Look out for Hilderbrand and his gang. I shall get the men paid off to-morrow, and will be down Monday, I think. Direct answer to headquarters District of Saint Louis. They think here at headquarters that it is all a silly scare. Have you picketed the Farmington road?

Captain Company E, Fiftieth Missouri Infantry.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,April 28, 1865.

Lieutenant MORAN, Potosi:

Inform the citizens of Potosi that the rumor of a large force of rebels in southeast Missouri is without foundation in fact. Keep them quiet and keep your men well in hand. Telegraph Colonel Malone, at Pilot Knob, and he will advise you of the facts. Inform the citizens that there is no danger, and if they then choose to leave they do so without justification.
