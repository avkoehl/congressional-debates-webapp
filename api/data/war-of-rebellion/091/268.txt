(Received 8.30 p. m.)

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Taylor,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Gallupe telegraphs me from Manassas this evening that the Fifth Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery is at Gainesville; that he will advance it seventeen miles to-morrow, and move the Two hundred and second Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers to Gainesville. Had I not better move to-morrow the six companies of the Two hundred and first Regiment to Manassas Junction? They will be ready to move there. There will be nothing between Bull Run bridge and Gainesville, if the Two hundred and second is removed to the latter point, if this is not done.

Respectfully, yours,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel GANSEVOORT,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade, Falls Church, Va.:

You will prepare one company of your regiment at once for detached service, and send it to Alexandria, to reach that point by 10 a. m. to-morrow. On his arrival there the commanding officer will draw ten days' rations of subsistence and forage for his command, and take the cars from the front, to join the Construction Corps on the Manassas Gap Railroad. This company is to act as couriers between the telegraph office with the Construction Corps and Major-General Sheridan's headquarters. You will therefore select the company whose commanding officer and men are most reliable, and who are best fitted from this very important duty.

Very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

C. C. AUGUR,
