QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

March 30, 1865.

Respectfully returned to Secretary of War.

The object of continuing the change of gauge to Danville is to receive the assistance of the wide-guage rolling-stock, now south of Salisbury, for the Danville, South Side, and Virginia and Tennessee railroads, on which General Lee's army is so dependent, and to secure the use of the trains of the latter roads in case of disaaster for the roads farther south, which are all of the same gauge with them. The losses of wide-gauge stock have been so serious in the last few months that all now remaining should be capable of transfer promotly to whatever section of the country the movements of our army may require.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.

NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 25, 1865.

General BRAGG,

Raleigh:

Governor Vance reports numerous stragglers near Raleigh. Please take measures for their arrest. State force would be sufficient.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 25, 1865.

General BRAGG,

Raleigh:

General Johnston directs me to say that you misapprehended him in regard to operations on Cape Fear. He thinks Lipscomb will be better employed in presence of enemy with Whitford, and has therefore suspended his movement. The Sixth North Carolina Cavalry belongs to the Virginia army, and it is desired to united it with its squadron on the Roanoke when practicable.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 25, 1865.

General CHESNUT,

Chester or Charlotte:

Please send the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Battalions South Carolina Reserves to join Blanchard's brigade; also all detachments from his present force.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 26, 1865.

General R. E. LEE:

French's division, of Stewart's corps, and Gibson's and Holtzclaw's brigades, of Lee's corps, are supposed to be somewhere in Mississippi. It is not known here by what authority these troops are absent from the Army of Tennessee. If it is not by yours, I respectfully ask that they be ordered to rejoin their corps immediately.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
