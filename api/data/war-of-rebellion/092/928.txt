In the Field, December 4, 1864.

In future, commanders of troops, in falling back before the enemy, will send reliable officers and men, at least one day in advance, to instruct citizens in which direction to drive their stock.

On the enemy's approach all horses, mules, and other stock that citizens have left on the enemy's line of march will be driven off, and proper receipts left for the same. When no owner can be found accurate accounts will be kept so that stock can be reclaimed by the owner.

LIEUTENANT: I received your order of 8 a. m. yesterday at 12 m., and moved to strike the enemy's flank. At 12 p. m. last night I received another order to report to you at Thomas' Station, and proceeded this morning at daylight in that direction; but finding it impossible to get there on account of the enemy, I attempted to join you at Waynesborough, and, getting within a mile and a half of town, I was again cut off, and had to fall back to this point. I will report with my command to-morrow morning.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. C. P. BRECKINRIDGE,

Colonel, Commanding, &c.
