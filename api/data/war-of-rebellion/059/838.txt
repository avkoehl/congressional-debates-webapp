Honorable SECRETARY OF THE NAVY:

SIR: In reply to your communication of the 19th instant, I would respectfully desire to have all my papers and documents now on file in your office transferred, as you suggest, tot he War Department, and there be placed on file,a s all my future applications must be with that officer.

Cut short as I have been, as you are pleased to infer, by a late act of Congress, my boats and crews lying idle, after the very heavy expense and almost insurmountable obstacles that I have had ot overcome in collection together such material for my expedition-thus cut short, when I expected to be busily engaged against the enemy, nevertheless I do not yet relinquish the hope of shortly being among them, doing my country good service.

Hoping that you will be pleased to give the transition of my papers form your Department all necessary attention, and soliciting your kind consideration and favorable opinion in my behalf,

I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

E. M. EFFERSON.
