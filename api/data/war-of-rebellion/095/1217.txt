I moved with the One hundred and sixteenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry and Thirty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry from Hatcher's Run about 8 a. m.; came on to the field in front of Fort Gregg, a very strong position held by the enemy. My command supported General Foster's division, of the Twenty-fourth Army Corps, advancing with him as he advanced. I found some rebel pickets behind an entrenched line,w ho annoyed my flank at first. I advanced by an oblique movement to the right, and then by a left half-wheel succeeded in placing one regiment of my command on the southern front of the fort. This gave me a direct fire on this front, and an enfilanding one on the westerly front. We advanced rapidly without firing till we reached a road some fifty yards from the fort, when we lay down and poured in a rapid and accurate fire. We suffered severely in reaching this point, but once there had the best of it. After lying here some twenty-five minutes and succeeding in a great measure in silencing the enemy's fire, we charged the works and placed our colors on the parapet among the first. The attack was gallantly made and most stubbornly resisted. The enemy refused to yield till we were fairly within their works. My loss was 1 commissioned officer and 16 men killed, and 63 men wounded. The members of my staff rendered me most efficient aid. Words of praise are unnecessary in speaking of the conduct of either officers or men; the result of their courage speaks sufficiently for them. The fort was found to contain 56 dead rebels, 2 rifled 3-inch guns with caissons and ammunition, some 250 prisoners with arms and equipments.

It gives me great pleasure to forward so good an account of the doings of Lieutenant-Colonel Kellogg, commanding One hundred and twenty-third Ohio Volunteers Infantry. The two guns taken by him were taken from General Milroy at Winchester. The colors of regiment were taken at the same time. The flags are old offenders, and furnish their own history.

Respectfully submitted.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that on the night of April 2 I placed the One hundred and sixteenth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry on picket in front of my brigade. I instructed Lieutenant-Colonel Teters, commanding, to post his vedettes well up to the enemy's works. He reports that at about 4 a. m., finding that the enemy had abandoned the works, he advanced a portion of his skirmish line into the fort. He found about sixty stand of arms and a small quantity of tobacco. He was in the works before the artillery opened.

Respectfully submitted.
