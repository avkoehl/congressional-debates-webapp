1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1203
in the practice, sofarasthis clerk is concerned,
was made on motion of the geutleman from
Indiana [Mr. Julian] in the organization of
the Forty-First Congress. Until that time this
clerk was paid the same as the clerks of the
other committees. On his motion it was made
a salaried office, just the same as the others
which are included in this bill.
And now, since we have started upon meas-
ures of reform and are attempting to wipe out
some of the small sins of Congress, it seems to
me this is one of the places to begin, and I
have therefore moved to reduce this clerkship
from a salaried office to the same footing as
other clerkships in this House.
Mr. JULIAN. The gentleman from Ohio
is mistaken in saying that this salary was fixed ;
on my motion at the beginning of the Forty- I
FirstCongress.
Mr. WELKER. It was on somebody's
motion.
Mr. JULIAN. It has stood there by order
of the House ever since 1802. It was done on
the motion of the tlien chairman of the Com-
mittee on the Public Lands, (Mr. Potter,) a
Representative on this floor from the State of
Wisconsin. The question now brought up was
agitated a year ago, and this House decided
that that clerk was properly classified with the
three clerks named. He has not only charge
of the papers and the journal of the proceed-
ings of that committee, but by resolution of the
House he is specially charged with the preser-
vation and care of the land maps of the House,
and the duty of perfecting the mapping, showing
the progress of the surveys and sales of the
public lands. I know or ought to know some-
thing of his duties, having been chairman of
the Committee on the Public Lands for several
years, and am now, that if either of the clerks 1
whose employment is on an annual salary has
the right to it this clerk is entitled to his. There
is no reason, and none can be given, why he
should be made an exception to the rule.
Mr. WELKER. Let me call the gentle-
man's attention to the appropriation bill of
last year, where there is no appropriation for
the clerk of his committee. The present is
the first occasion when the appropriation for
this clerk appears.
Mr. JULIAN. There was an appropriation
last year, and for every year since 1862. _
Mr. WELKER. I have the appropriation
bill before me, and there is no such appropri-
ation in that bill.
Mr. JULIAN. The gentleman is mistaken.
I find it in the appropriation bill, and the gen-
tleman must have overlooked it.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. I move to
amend the amendment by striking out the last
word. I want to add my testimony to that of
the chairman of the Committee on the Public
Lands as to the way in which this salary is
earned. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Wel-
ker] is evidently much mistaken as to how
long the salary has been paid, and I think he
is equally mistaken as regards the point of how
far it is deserved. I have been conversant,
during the short period I have been here, with
the business of that committee, and I doubt
whether the clerk of any committee in this
House has more faithfully earned his salary
than the clerk of the Committee on the Public
Lands.
Mr. WELKER, On how many days of the
week do the committee meet ?
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. It has been
meeting regularly twice a week, and occasion-
ally three times a week. We have arranged
for three meetings next week, and there is an
amount of business before the committee which
will require it to meet twice as frequently as it
has done hitherto if its business is to be got
through.
The question being put on Mr. Welker's
amendment, there were, on a divisionâ€”ayes
40, noes 60 ; no quorum voting.
Tellers were ordered ; and Mr. Welker and
Mr. Julian were appointed.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. I move that
the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and the
Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr. Cessna
reported that the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, pursuant to order of the
House, had had under consideration the Union
generally, and particularly the special order,
being House bill No. 974, making appropria-
tions for the legislative, executive, and judicial
expenses of the Government for the year end-
ing June 30, 1871, and had come to no reso-
lution thereon.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message from the Senate, by Mr. Hamlin,
one of its clerks, announced that the Senate
had agreed to the report of the committee of
conference on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses on the amendments of the House to
the bill (S. No. 435) providing for the tem-
porary relief of poor and destitute people in
the District of Columbia.
And then, on motion of Mr. DAWES, the
House (at four o'clock and thirty minutes p.
m.) adjourned.
