Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Asst. Adjt. General, Army of the Potomac:

The Third Division of the Second Corps returned yesterday p.m., and was massed on the Halifax road in the vicinity of the Lewis and Perkins houses. No other changes in the positions of the troops of my command during the last twenty-four hours. The report of the field officer of the day of the First Division, December 11 and 12, states that the officer commanding pickets Third Brigade reported that the enemy sent up a balloon the evening of the 11th, and that they appeared to be moving troops and at work on the intrenchments. Further, the field officer of the day for yesterday reported that some troops of the enemy had been moved out of their intrenchments during recent operations, and were on Sunday on the road leading west from Fort Cummings; were not there yesterday. I attach but little credence to any of these statements.

Major-General of Volunteers.
