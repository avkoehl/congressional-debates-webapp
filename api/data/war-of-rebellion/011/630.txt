to great extent. Governor Johnson has given authority to several of the officers of his guard to occupy houses during my absence with their men all in camp. Have the orders been so changed as to allow this and has the Governor the authority to do it?

The command of General Buell had best halt before it crosses Tuscumbia River until further advice.

LOUISVILLE, June 5, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

I have this day ordered the A. M. Sullivan to Paducah, Ky. Will arrive Friday evening to await your orders there. She draws 12 inches, the lightest in the country, and will answer your purpose. Can I serve you further?

Col. J. B. FRY:

Telegram received. The steamboat W. A. Baird is now here, and draws only 16 inches; it is the lightest boat I can hear of.

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

INDIANAPOLIS, June 5, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

The Forty-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteers, Colonel Ray, at Cumberland Ford, has been reduced more than one-half by sickness; they only have 220 officers and men reported for duty out of 900. This sickness is daily increasing, and their camp is in an unhealthy location. They can get no supplies such as sick men can eat and but little for well men. There is nothing within 80 miles of them, not even straw or hay to fill bed-ticks for their sick, who are compelled to lay on the ground. Will you please order the regiment to Lexington, where they can get supplies and be properly cared for? Both General Carter and surgeon recommend it. Humanity and justice demand that this should be done.

Please answer immediately, as I desire to take immediate steps for their relief.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.
