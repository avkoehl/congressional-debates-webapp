here this morning from Meridian. Have charged Forrest with defense of Mississippi prairie country. He has 6,000 effective cavalry. Some militia and reserves of Mississippi are all I can give him. An Alabama battalion of reserves, Davidson's, has volunteered to go to him. The chief objects of my care are the prairie country of Mississippi, Selma, and Mobile. There is an earnest spirit throughout the people, and I believe all will be well. General PAGE is too despondent. He seems to see only the weak points of these forts. We need a buoyant man there. Effective total in District of Gulf, 2,750. Brigadier-General Liddell has about 1,200, General Wirt Adams about 500, General Forrest about 6,000.*

The enemy have landed on Dauphin Island, seven miles below Fort Gaines. An attack against our outer line is no doubt meditated. Please send me back heavy artillerists, the Louisiana artillery and First Mississippi Artillery.
