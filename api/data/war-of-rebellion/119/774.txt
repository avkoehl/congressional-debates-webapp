Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

SIR: The Secretary of War, in the belief that the treatment of prisoners of war in Richmond has been materially improved, is disposed to authorize, and he desires, and prisoners held by us shall be allowed to purchase from sutlers such articles as may be necessary for their comfort-tobacco, pipes, and a few other things which must be designated under your instructions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers and Commissioner for Exchange.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a letter* referred by Mr. Ould from medical officers recently held at Fort McHenry as prisoners of war, complaining of the treatment received while at the fort. I have indorsed upon it a reply to such of their complaints as are of any consequence, though I have great doubt of the propriety of taking any notice of such a paper. + Mr. Ould has forwarded several such complains, some of them being mere tissue of untruths, all of which have been satisfactorily answered, and he has no right to expect that they shall be further answered. I respectfully refer this case to you for such action as you may deem proper.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

The proposition was accepted, and I have furnished through General Meredith full rolls of all officers held by us up to the 1st of October, and all officers and soldiers who have died up to the 1st of April. In return I have received a roll of officers held at Richmond to October 26, and a list of less than 200 deaths, which of course is very far short of the number who have died. I will forward to you to-day by mail a roll of 764 officers captured since the 1st of September, which may contain the names of some who were on the roll heretofore furnished, as, to insure that none should be omitted. I have gone back to the 1st of September. I send at the same time a list of 250 deaths, covering all cases not before reported. I would respectfully suggest that before these rolls are
