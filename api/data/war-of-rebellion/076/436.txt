THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS, August 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I expect the 4 1/2-inch guns to-day. Will send you word as soon as they arrive.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Before Atlanta, August 9, 1864-8.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The ammunition will be here to-morrow morning for the 4 1/2-inch guns. The battery is formed and there of the guns here now. I have already made my intrenchments almost impregnable, but will have them re-examined for additional improvements if necessary. Deserters and refugees report to-night that Farragut has passed into Mobile Bay with his gun-boats and transports, and it is believed in Atlanta that he has possession of Mobile.

GEO. H. THOMAS,Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 9, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have a dispatch from General Meigs that Colonel Mackay is appointed as your assistant quartermaster, Colonel Easton as chief, and Colonel Bingham as inspector for me. I believe the report of the Mobile matter. It was, as you remember, a part of the original design. Now if General Canby can follow it up it will be of vast assistance to us. Get your guns well into position, and the moment the ammunition comes, left them open slowly, and with great precision,making all parts of the town unsafe. Guns of that caliber with good shells have a better effect than any I ever used.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
