made to the several persons named in the
deprees, or their legal representatives, the sev-
eral sums awarded them, respectively, with
interest to each person from the date of the
decree under which he receives payment.
โข The bill was ordered to a third reading ;
and it was accordingly read the third time,
and passed.
Mr. DAWES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
BRITISH STEAMER LABUAN.
Mr. DAWES, from the same committee,
reported back, with the recommendation that it
do pass, the bill (S. No. 84) to carry into effect
the decree of the district court of the United
States for the southern district of New York,
in the case of the British steamer Labuan.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be read a third time.
The bill was read. It directs the Secretary
of the Treasury to pay to William Bailey, Wil-
liam Leetham, and John Leetham, owners of
the British steamer. Labuan, of England, the
sum of $131,221 30, with interest from June
2, 1862, to the time of payment, and $5,000
without interest; also to Messrs. De Jersey &
Co., of England, or their legal representatives,
part owners of the cargo of the same steamer,
$3,613 92, with interest from May 21, 1862, to
the time of payment; and to Francisco Armen-
diaz, of Matamoras, Mexico, or his legal rep-
resentatives, part owner of the cargo of the
same steamer, $2,067 18, with interest from
June 6, 1802, to the time of payment; such
sums being due under a decree of the district
court of the United States for the southern
district of New York, pronounced March 25,
1868, on account of the illegal capture of the
British steamer Labuan and her cargo by a
cruiser of the United States.
Mr. CALKIN. I would like to have some
explanation of this bill.
Mr, MAYNARD. I would like to know how
much all these allowance amount to.
Mr. CALKIN. We are passing bills here
appropriating millions of money for the pay-
ment of British claims.
Mr. DAWES. I will state that all the bills
I have sent up involve the amount of ยง085,-
882 92 and some interest, as a portion of the
decrees required interest to be paid. I will
state that in the greater part of these cases the
ships were seized by the marshal of Louisiana,
and by order of the court they were sold and
the proceeds were placed upon deposit in the
First National Bank of Louisiana. The mar-
shal and the bank have failed. The court
decided against the United States, but the
money had gone, and now the United States
is obliged to pay that money out of the Treas-
ury or itself be in default. They are all de-
crees of the courts, and judgments of the courts
rendered in the Supreme Court and ordered
to be executed by the district court. Four
out of the six were in Louisiana, and two in
the city of New York. These are very large
sums, and I ain sorry to be compelled to ask
the House to appropriate for them ; but I see
no other way but to meet the judgments of the
courts like men, and pay them.
Mr. CALKIN. I have nothingto say against
the judgments of the courts ; but the judgment
of this House and the judgment of the country
is that it is a well-known fact that during the
war every vessel that hovered about our south-
ern coast flying the English flag was a blockade-
runner ; and I am constrained to believe that
most of the vessels for which we are appropri-
ating money to pay damages were engaged in
the blockade-running business and were caught
at it, and then appealed to the courts on the
ground that they were under the British flag,
and receive compensation after having been
engaged in an unlawful business.
Mr. DAWES, That is a fact which was
submitted to the courts and .found against the
gentleman, and the gentleman proposes, not-
withstanding it was found by the court that
this was a laxvful cruise and a lawful voyage
of the vessel held by these owners, to offset
that judgment, and to settle our claim upon
the British Government for the destruction by
the Alabama of our vessels by going, as is sug-
gested by a gentleman near me, over the Can-
ada line to steal some of their property, to
steal their horses. We have no right to retain
this money, and it does not make it any more
right because the British Government may be
liable and ought to respond for the damages
caused by the Alabama. And how can the
gentleman hold up his hands and enforce our
claims growing out of the operations of the
Alabama if he is not willing to meet the just
claims upon this Government of British sub-
jects? The only ground upon which, before
the judgment of mankind, we can ask the
British Government to respond to those dam-
ages is because we are ready ourselves at all
times and under all circumstances to meet any
just demands made by her subjects upon us.
Mr. CALKIN. So far as magnanimity
toward the British Government is concerned
we have always been showing it; but I have
not seen anything of the kind exhibited on
their part. So far as going across the Canada
line is concerned, I am quite willing to go
across the line and take the whole of Canada
into the Union.
Mr. DAWES. I now call the previous ques-
tion.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill was passed.
Mr. DAWES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
SCHOONER I,. S T>AVTS AND CARGO.
Mr. DAWES, from the Committee on Appro-
priations, reported back, with a recommend-
ation that it be passed, a bill of the House
(No. 2209) to carry iijto effect the decree of the
circuit court of the United States for the south-
ern district of New York in the case of the
schooner L. S. Davis and her cargo.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The lull, which was read, directs the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, out of any money not
otherwise appropriated, to pay into the circuit
court of the United States for the southern dis-
trict of New York, in the suit therein of Alexan-
der M. Douglass, libelant, against the schooner
L. S. Davis, her tackle and cargo, the United
States claimants, the sum of $21,371 20, being
the amount of the decree to the libelant in said
cause against the said claimants; to be disposed
of by said court according to the decree therein.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. DAWES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
COAST SURVEY REPORTS.
Mr. MUNGEN, from the Committee on
Printing, reported back, with a recommenda-
tion that the same be adopted, the following
concurrent resolution:
Resolved by the Semite, (tb e House of Kepresenta-
tives concurring,) Tint there be printed of the report
of the Superintendent of the United States Coast Sui-
vey for the year 1869, one thousand extra copies for
the use of the Senate, two thousand extra copies for
the use of the House of Representatives, and one
thousand extra copies for distribution by the Super-
intendent of the Coast Survey.
The question was taken upon the resolution;
and it was adopted.
Mr. MUNGEN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the resolution was adopted; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid on
the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
STATEMENT Of PUBLIC DEBT,
Mr. SCHENCK,* from the Committee of
Ways and Means, reported the following
resolution; which was read, considered, and
adopted;
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be '
requested to communicate to this House, In a form
for convenient reference, the amount of the public
debt at the end of each fiscal year since the organ-
ization of the Government, the rate of interest
theieou, the amount redeemed or paid after maturity
in each year, the amount purchased or redeemed
before maturity in each year, and the rate of pre-
mium or discount at which it was purchased or re-
deemed.
Mr. SCHENCK moved to reconsider the
vote by which the resolution was adopted ;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
MONEYS PAID INTO COURTS.
Mr. SCHENCK, from the Committee of
Ways and Means, reported a bill (II. R. No.
2373) relating to moneys paid into the courts
of the United States; which was read a first
and second time, ordered to be printed, and
recommitted to the Committee of Ways and
Means.
COMMON ROAD STEAM LOCOMOTIVE.
Mr. SCHENCK, from the Committee of
Ways and Means, reported a bill (IT. R. No.
2374) to authorize the importation, free of
duty, of a common road steam locomotive ;
which was read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, authorizes G. W.
Dick, of Butler county, Ohio, to import, free
of duty, from Scotland a common road steam
locomotive for experimental purposes, under
such instructions as may be given by the Sec-
retary of the Treasury in the case.
Mr. WOOD. I would like to hear some
reason given why this bill should be passed.
Mr. SCHENCK. This bill is reported sim-
ply for this reason: it has been brought to
the notice of the Committee of Ways and
Means, upon petition and papers referred to
them, that in Scotland the difficulty in rela-
tion to tractation by a common steam loco-
motive upon common roads has probably at
length been overcome. A citizen of Ohio has
gone to Scotland, and proposes at bis own
expense to purchase and bring to this country
one of these common road locomotives for the
purpose of giving it a fair trial in this coun-
try, provided the Government will let him
bring it in free of duty. The Committee of
Ways and Means thought the subject was im-
portant enough to justify granting him the
privilege to bring in one of these locomotives
free of duty, for the purpose of trying the
experiment. Heretofore, in almost every case,
the experiment of steam locomotives on com-
mon roads has been almost altogether a failure.
Mr. WOOD. The Central Park commis-
sioners, of New York city, a few years ago
brought over one of these machines and paid
the duties upon it.
Mr. SCHENCK. There was established in
my own town a very large manufactory for the
making of these locomotives for ordinary roads;
but it turned out in the end to be rather a fail-
ure, for some reason which I am not prepared
to explain. But the difficulties are now thought
to have been overcome by an inventive Scotch-
man, and we wish to try one of those loco-
motives.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. SCHENCK moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
