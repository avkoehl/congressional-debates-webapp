Mr  FORSYTH then rose and observed, that
theie wis not ame to pioceed to the ciacussionof
tl e othei íes lution otleied by the Senator fiom

to I is (Vlr  F"s)    in    e on trie romj rorrise bill of
las' sesaio       lhe ¿•entleman adveiud to his op-
position to h as rn evidence of tl e hostility of the
President of the United States to a peucefnl set le-
ment of that question     He called it to the lecol-
lection oí tl e Senate, tint his opposition to that
bill was founded ui a singl  point    In his opinion, '
theconstitut onal lights of theSenateweie violated
by its in roducta i heie,as it belonged exclusively '
to the other lloare     But when it hrd been acted
on by the ot iei House, ai d come back here, he
overlroked the oljec mi    and gave his assent to ,
its nassrge, but with t le hope of pi ikui" it better
He ho )ed the gent eu in from Sou n Caiolma,
and í II who knew lnm daring his political life, as t
we'l m the Senate as m the otier lit Use, would I
do him the jusuce to know that none of his acts
emanated fr im any Lranch of this Government,
oi that his suppoit of any measure was given to ¡
it because it was an Adn initiation mensure    lie i
b'd always dane justice to eveiy Administration,
approving oi c  rdemnmg according to the dictates
of his own judgment      Ind he felt ihat he ought
to  do   the Pic i lent   the  pisti e to say, that it
was his aid it wish to do just ce to the Sauth as
legarded the taiifF     Further, he would also say
that he believed thit the unfortunate situation of
oui sister State might have been more favorably '
settled for her than under £be auspices of the ger-
tleman from Kentucky, by whose assistance it
was settled
I Mr PRESTON lephed, that when the compro-
mise bill was penuirg, it was not thought <-s good
a^ the Sou h could have wished or expected But
until it was expected to pass he never heard that
jthe Admmistiation intended to give them a better
bill than the nriff ot '32 Then he did But he
never heard any propos tion of a modihed tariff
till the compromiso bill was introduced
Mi I OR.SYTH made the remarks just offered
in just fication of the President As to his (Mr.
r s) couise upon the comp.omise bill, he ob-
served that the final question on the bill was sus-
pended till the action of the othei Hause was had,
and tl en it was adiritted that the ground he had
| taken was correct In reference to the President
he would orly say, thrt ins openng message to
Congress, at the peuod ijluded to, was hailed by
the whole South as the harbinger of peace and
justice to that section And the gentleman from
Kentucky anpealed to that circumstance to show
that the President had determined the bid should
I go down, and that his popularity was sufficient to
I cany it thirugh
