I rezret to trespass on the pat erceof the Senate,
but I wish, i¿ justice to mjself to ask their atten-
tion to one more, which, though not immediately
relating to the question under consideration, is not
irrelevant to my vindication I not only expressed
my opinions freely in relation to the currency and
the bank, in the speech from which such copious
extracts have been read, but had the precaution to
define m> political position distinctly m reference
lo t'ie political parties of the day, and the course I
tv iul(l pursue ¿n relation to each I then, as now,
be opged to the party to «hicn it is my glory ever
to h i\e been attached exclusively, and avowed,
explicitly, that I belonged to neither of the ttvo
parties, Opposition or Admimslrafon, then con-
ttndmg for superiority, which of itself ought to go
f-rto repel the charge of the Senator from Ken-
tucky, that I have gone over from one partv to
the other. The Secretary will read the last ex-
tract
141 am the partisan as I have said, of ni e rt^ nor let me
add, of any political party I am neit! i yf the Opposition nor
ol the Administration if Tact with the irrnenn any ms'ance,
i is because lappiove ofthe rcourseon hepart cularoccasio ,
and I sh 11 always be happy to act with them when 1 do ap
pi ove If I oppose the ymms ration, if Idcf-ireto see power
change hands, it is because Id eapprove of the general courseof
t ose in authority , because they have depaited from ihe pr n
ciples onv huh they came mío office, because, instead of usj^g
the immense power and patronage put m their hanás to secure
the lib"rry ofthe country and advance the public good, they
have perverted them into party instruments for personal oh
jectb But mine has not been norvvilitbe a systematic op
position Whatever measure of heirs I may deem risht, í
f. íall cheerfully support and I only desire that thev shall afford
me more frequent occasions fir s pr irt and fewer for oppo
sit on, thin ih^y have heretofo e done
Such, Senators, are my recorded sentiments in
1834 Thev are futl aid explicit on all the ques-

then, and, of course, if my relation  to the two op-
posing parties are changed—if I now act with
those that I then opposed, and oppose those with
whom I then acted, the change is not m we I at
'east have stood still In saying this, 1 accu e none
of changing I leave others to explain their posi-
tion, row and then, lfthej shou'd deeai explana-
tion neeessai} But, if I may be permi'ted to
sfterm opinion, I mould sav tnat the chan?e 's
ra i et in the question and the circumstance', than
in the op n ons or principies ot enhei of the part es
The Opposition weie ihcn and nt   National Bank
men, «t d IheAdm .listia ion, m like manner, were
anti-national banl , ?nd in fat or of a league of
Siatt banks, vhile I pre e.rtd then, as now, the
former to the latter, rnd a duoiee from banks to
e tber. TV he" the ex. Ti" " t o' 'he league failed,
the Adminisii-ation weie let ced to the <ptton b -
tvtetn a Natío al Banh and a di cree Thej che e
the Idttei, and such, I ha^ei.orcrson to doubt,
Hon'd have been their choice, had the opticn been
tie same four v ears agí N r have I any doubt,
In ! the option been tne*i between i 'e-tgue of banks
a d divorce, the Oppos Hon then, as now, would
1 \ e be n in fav oi ot Ihe leiguf In all this there
is more apparent than real change As 'o mjselr,
tnerc has been neither If I ac ed with the Oppo-
sttn n an 1 oppos-ed the Administration then, it was
because I was openly opposed to the removal of
the depesites and the league of banks, as I now
ara, and if I now act with the latter and oppose
the foimer, it is because I am now, as t! en, in
f av or of a divorce, and oppt sed to e ther a league
of Si-it" banks or aN.noinl Bank, except indeed
as tne means of effecting a divorce grcduMly and
•safeh What, then, is my oftencc"! Yy hat 1 it
lefQsmg to abandon mv first choice, the dnoice
from the banks, because the Administration has
seltcled it, and of go.ng with the Oppos tion for a
national Bank, to w hich I hav e been an 1 am st a
o iposed 1 That is all, an i for 'his i ar i charged

II id some guardian an0el, Mr Picsilent, whis-
pered m my ear at ihe time, "be cautious what
you My,tins question will not teimmatt here foui
jeais hence it will be revived, under very difierent
cucumstances, when vour principles and durv will
compel )ou to act with those >ou now oppose, and
oppose those with whom you now act, and  hen
you will be charged with the desertion of princi-
ples," I could not have guarded myself more effec-
tually than I have done Yet, in the face of all
this, the Senator has not only made the charge, but
has said, in his place, that he heard, for the first
time in his life, at the extra session, (hat I was op-
posed to a National Bank1 I cou'd place the Sena-
tor in a dilemma, from which there is no possibility
of escape. I might say to him, you have either
forgot or not what I said in 1834 If j ou have
not, how can you justify yourself in making the
charge you have1 But if you have—if vou have
forgot what is so recent, and what, from the mag-
nitude of the question and the importance of the
occasion, was so well calculated to impress itself
on your memory, what possib'e value «an be at-
tached to your recollection or opinions, as to my
course on more remote and less memorable occa-
sions, on which you have undertaken to impeach
my conduct1   He may take his choice.
Havmsr now established bv the record that I
have changed no opinion, abandoned no principle,
nor deserted any party, the charge of the Senator,
with all the aspersions with which he accompanied
it, falls prostrate to the earth. Here I misht leave
the subject, and close my vindication. But I choose
not. I shall follow the Senator up, step by step, in
his unprovoked, and, I may now add, ground-
less attack, with blows not less decisive and victo-
rious.
The Senator next proceeded to state, that in a
certain document (if he named, it I did not hear
him) I assigned as the reason why I could not join
ir the attack on the Administration, that the benefit
of the victory would not enure to myself or mv
partv, or, as he explained hims«lt, because it would
rot place nnsc'f and them in power I presume
be referred to a let er, in answer to an invitation to
a public dinner, offered me by mj od a"d faithful
friends and constituents of Edgefield, in rpproba-
tion of my course at ilv extra session.
[Mr Clai     Ido]
The pressure of domes'ic engagements would not
permit me to accept their imitation, and, in de-
clm'fig it, I deemed it due to them and mvself to
explain my course, m i's political and part/ bear-
ing, more fully than I had done in debate. They
had a right to know my reasons, and I expressed
mjself With the frankness due to the long and un n-
termpted confidence that h?d ever existed be-
tween us
Having made these explanatory remark* I now
proceed to meet the assertion of the Senator, and I
again take ¡ssue on ihe fact I assigned no such
reason as the Senator attributes tome I never
dreamed nor thought cf such a one, noi c?n ary
force of construction export it from what I sa d
No m\ object w as not pow er oi plice, either for
mvseif or party It was far more burrb'e and
honest It w as to sav e ourselves and our principles
from being absorbed and lost ia a partt more n i-
meious and powerful, but differing from us on
almost every principle and question of pohcy.
When the suspension of specie payments took
place in May last, (not unexpected to me,) I im-
mediately turned my attention to the event car-
nes* !y, ctnsidenng it as an event pregnant with
great and lasting consequences Reviewing the
vvhele giound, I saw nothing to change n iV cp -
mens and p nciples I had avowed m 1-34, rnd I
determined to eairj then out, a= far is ci etui-
stances and my abil ty would enalle r t But I
saw that my course must be influenced I v i  pjs -
non which the two great corten Ins  ptrties mi,.rtt
