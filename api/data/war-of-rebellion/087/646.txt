quite close, then pouring in a heavy volley, our men repulsed them handsomely and punished them severely. No farther assault was made, but a constant sharpshooting fire was kept up by both sides and our line was furiously shelled at short intervals. The line was held till 8.30 p. m., when, in obedience to orders, the regiment was withdrawn with a loss of 5 killed, 22 wounded, and 7 missing.* Most of the latter have turned up.

Respectfully submitted.

Your obedient servant,

J. K. ROBINSON,

Lieutenant Colonel Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Commanding Regiment.

Commanding Second Brigade, Second Division, Cavalry Corps.

SIR: I have the honor to report that one caisson (3-inch rifled gun) was lost while in action, October 27, 1864. Said caisson had its stock broken by a cannot-shot, rendering it totally unserviceable. Said caisson had two ammunition chests, both containing seventy rounds 3-inch rifled gun-projectiles. All the implements were removed, and the chests left open, as it was raining.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,ED. L. GARVIN,

First Lieutenant, U. S. Artillery, Commanding.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION.

The report is not satisfactory, and another will be made immediately showing reasons why no efforts were made to bring off the caisson or parts of it; also why the ammunition was not thrown out or otherwise destroyed.
