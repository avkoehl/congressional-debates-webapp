Averell. It was believed that this was destined for Petersburg. The whole line is very weak since Averell's departure, pickets have fallen back considerably, and the line is now near the railroad. Hadnot Rosser better be held in statu quo for Averell? The negroes have left the Valley (colored troops) for Baltimore since Forrest's wxploit in the West. I send you some late papers and will send Ransom overearly in the morning. Colonel Mosbys' letter placing the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps at Annapolis was, I think, dated 13th of April. If the Eleventh and Twelfth were then in the West, is it possible that they could have transferred in so brief a time? Kilpatrick has been ordered to Sherman and has published a farewell to his division. I will write to Colonel Mosby to-morrow andto Stringfellow.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

General Beuregard has received no order defining his command. He deisres to know how many troops he will have in his command. He is ready to co-operate with you, and desires you to give him all the news transpiring in front. No further news from Hoke. He has sent all orders received. The general supposes he is temporarily relieved in his old department. I will stay here at general's request for a few days.
