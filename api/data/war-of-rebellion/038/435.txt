General GRANT:

There is no news of importance from Port Hudson. Garrison still holds out, and have nothing but parched corn to live on. Kirby Smith is trying to relieve them by attacking the point opposite. Banks had two repulses. Loss in killed and wounded 4,000. The rebels have about 3,000 in the fort, so say the deserters.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Near Vicksburg, June 24, 1863.

Admiral DAVID D. PORTER, Comdg. Mississippi Squadron:

ADMIRAL: I have just received information that the rebel Bledsoe has gone from Yazoo City to a point on the Mississippi shore about 6 miles above Greenville. He has with him about 15 cavalry and a battery of light artillery. My cavalry and spare troops are now out with Sherman, looking for Johnston, so that I cannot well attend to him. Can you send the Marine Brigade up to clean Bledsoe out? and they might land at Greenville and dash in behind them, so as to secure the artillery, if nothing more.

Please answer by bearer, so that I may fit out an expedition for Greenville in case the Marine Brigade cannot go.

Respectfully, yours,

U. S. GRANT.

MEMPHIS, TENN., June 24, 1863.

Major General RICHARD J. OGLESBY, La Grange, Tenn.:

GENERAL: A considerable force of cavalry and artillery crossed the Tennessee River, between Duck River and Saltillo, on the 22nd. I suppose they are the three regiments of cavalry and artillery reported by Dodge.

Mizner has not been heard of here. I think he has followed Chalmers into the Mississippi bottom.

Anything more of the force in your front? Keep me advised as long as the telegraph lasts.
