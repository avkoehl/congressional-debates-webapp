THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

is at present very great, that their pride is deeply
wounded by what they call an attempt to coerce
them by threats to the payment of a sum which
they persist—in opposition to the plainest proof-
in declaring not to be due This feeling is fostered
by the language of our opposition papers, particu-
larly by the Intelligencer and New York Courier,
extracts from which have been sent on by Amer-
icans, declaring them to be the sentiments of a
majority of the people These, as you will see, are
translated and republished hete, with such com-
ments as they might have been expected, and un-
doubtedly weie intended,to produce, and if hostil-
ities should take place between the two countries,
those persons may flatter themselves with having
the credit of a great share in producing them The
only letter I have received from home is one from
my family This, to my great satisfaction, informs
me that the President will be supported by all par
ties, and I am told that this is the language of some
of the opposition papers, but as they are not sent
to the legation, I cannot tell in what degree this
support can be depended upon Whether the en-
ergetic language of the message will be made the
pretext with some, or be the cause with others,
among the Deputies for rejecting the law, cannot,
of course, be yet conjectured with any great degi ee
of probability, but I think it will have a good
effeU It has certainly raised us in the estimation
of other Powers, if I mayjudge from the demeanor
of then representatives here, and my own opinion
is, that as soon as the first excitement subsides, it
will operate favorably on the Councils of Prance
Already some of the journals begin to change
their tone, and I am much mistaken if the oppo
sition heie, finding that we are in earnest, will
incur the responsibility of a rupture between the
two nations, which they see must take place if
the treaty be rejected. The funds experienced a
considerable fall as soon as .the message was
known, and insurance rose, in short, it has made
them feel the commercial, as well as political,
importance of our country
The Count de Rigny had requested me to com-
municate the message to him as soon as it shou'd
be received Thi<? I promised to do, and accord j
mgly,on the morning of the 8th, to avoid any mis
take as to the mode of making the communica
tion, I carried the paper to him myself, telling
him that I had received a gazette containing a paper,
said to be the message oí the Piesident, whicn 1
dehvered to him in compliance with my promise,
but I requested him to observe that it was not an
autnentic paper, nor was it delivered in puisuance
of instructions, nor in my official character 1
thought it, for obvious reasons, necessary to be
very explicit on this point, and he probably under-
stood me, as he had not yet read the message
Little more passed at the interview, and I thought
of it, but not immediately, to seek another I
shall piobably, however, see him to night, and
shall then appoint some ame for a further confer
ence, of wh ch I will, by th.s same packet, give
you the result
Mi Middleton had just airived from Madrid,
with the inscriptions for the Spanish indemnity,
and a draft for the first ¡ ayment of interest His
instructions are, he says, to leave them with me,
but, as [ have heard nothing from the department,
I shall advise the depositing them with Rothschild
to wait the directores of the Piesident
The importance of obtaining the eaihest intel-
ligence, at this crisis of our affairs with France,
has induced me to direct that my letteis should
be sent by the Estafette from Havre, and that, if
any important advices should be received,at such
an hour n the day as would give a courier an
advance of some hours over the Estafette, tnat a
special messenger should be despatched with it
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir,
your most obedient servant,

Legation or the Umted Stated, )
Hon John Forsyth
Sir The intended conference with the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, of which t spoke to you in my
last, No 70, took place yesterday morning I
began it by expressing my regret that a communi-
cation from the President to Congress had been so
much misrepresented in that part which related to
France, as to be construed into a measure of hos-
tilities It was, I said, part of a consultation
between different members of our Government,
as to the proper course to be pursued, if the
legislative Aiody of France should persevere in
refusing to provide the means of complying with
a treaty formally made That the Piesident, as
was his duty, stated the facts truly, and in mod-
erate language, Without any irritating comment
That in further pursuance of his official duty he
declared the different modes of redress which
the law of nations peimitted, in order to avoid
.hostilities—expressing, as he ought to do, his
reasons for pieferung one of them That in all
this there was nothing addressed to the French na-
tion , and I likened it to a proceeding, well known
in the Fiench law, (a family council in which the
concerns and wtei ests are d tscussed,) but of which
in our case the debates weie necessarily made
public That a further elucidation of the nature of
this document might be drawn from the circum-
stance that no instructions had been given to com-
municate it to the French Government, and that if
a gazette containing it had been delivered, it was
at the request of his Excellency, and expressly
declared a private communication, not an official
one I further stated that I made this communi-
cation without instructions, merely to counteract
misapprehensions, and from an eáinest desire to
rectify errors which might have serious conse-
quences I added that it was very unfortunate
that an earlier call of the Chambers had not been
made in consequence of Mr Serruner's promise,
the non-compliance with which, was of a nature
to cause serious disquietude with the Govei nment
of the united Siates I found immediately, that
this was the part of the message that had most
seriously affected the King, for Count de Rigny
immediately took up the argument, endeavoring
to show that the Government had acted in good
faith, relying principally on the danger of a second
rejection had the Chambers been called, at an early
day, expressly for this object I replied, repeat-
ing that the declaration made by M Serruier was
a positive and formal one, and that it had pro-
duced a forbearance on the part of the Piesident
to lay the state of the case before Congress In
this conference, which was a long one, we both
regretted that any misunderstanding should inter
rupt the good intelligence of two nations having
so many reasons to preserve it, and so few of con-
flicting interests He told me (what I knew be-
fore) that the exposition was prepared, and that
the law would have been presented the day after
that on which the message was received He
showed me the document, read part of it to me,
and expressed regret that the language of the
message prevented it being sent in I said tha' I
hoped the excitement would soon subside, and
give place to better feelings, in which I thought he
joined with much sincerity It is, perhaps, neces-
sary to add, that an allusion was made by me
to the change of Ministry in November, and the
reinstatement of presenuMimsters, which I told
him I had considered as a most favorable occur-
rence, and that I had so expressed mvself in my
communications to vou, but that this circumstance
was unknown at Washington when the message
was delivered, and I added, that the hopes of suc-
cess held out in the communication to which I
referred, and the assurances it contained that the
Mimsteis would zealously urge the adoption of the
law, might pi obaoly have imparted the same hopes
•to the President, and have induced some change in
themeasuie he had recommended But that the
formation of the Dupm Ministry if known, must
have had a very bad effect on the President's mind,
as many of that Ministry were known to be hos-
tile to the treaty
When 1 took leave, tne M nis'er requested me
to reflec* on the propriety of presenting a note of
our conversation, which, he "aid, should be formal
or o herwise, as I should desire I told him I
wou'd do so, and inform him on the next morn-
ing by eleven o'clock
We pprted as 1 thought, on fnend'y terms,
and n the evening, meeting him at the Austrian
Ambassador's, I told him that, on reflection, I had
determined to wait the arrival of the pacnet of the
16 h before I gave the note, to which he made no
objection After all this, you may judge of my
surprise, when last night, about ten o'clock, I
received the letter, a copy of which is enclosed,
and which necessarily closes my mission In my
reply, I shall take care to throw the responsibility
of breaking up the diplomatic intercourse between
the countries where it ought to rest, and will not
fail to expose the misstatements which you will
observe are contained in the Minister's note, both
as respects my Government and myself, but the
late hour at which I received the Count de Rig-
ny's note, and the almost immediate departure of
the packet, may prevent my sending you a copy
of my communication to him, which 1 shall use
the utmost diligence in preparing
The law, it is said, will be presented to day^and
I have very little doubt it will pass The mims-
tenal phalanx, reinfoiced by those of the Opposi-
tion (and they are not a few) who will not take
the responsibility of involving the country in the
difficulties which they now see must ensue, will
be sufficient to carry the vote The recall of Ser-
runer, and the notice to me, are measuies which
are resorted to to save the pride of the Government
and the natío

your most obedient servant,
EDW  LIVINGSTON
From Count De Rigny to Mr Livingston
[Translation ]
Department op Foreign Affairs,    )
Paris, Januaiy 13(A, 1835 )
Sir   You have well comprehended the nature
of the impressions produced  upon  the King's
Government by the  message which his Excel-
lency President Jackson addressed on the 1st of
December to the Congress of the United States
Nothing certainly could have prepared us for it
Even Though the complaints expressed in it had
been as just as they are m  reality unjust, we
should still have had a right to be astonished on
receiving the first communication of them in such
a form
In the explanations which 1 am now about to
make, I cannot enter upon the consideration of
any facts, othei than those occurring subsequently
to the vote by which the last Chamber of Depu-
ties refused the appropriation necessary for the
paymert stipulated in the treaty of July 4th
However this vote may have been regarded by
the Government of the United States, it is evident
that by accepting (accwnllant) the promise of the
King's Government to bring on a second deliber-
ation before the new Legislature, it had in fact
postponed all discussion, and all recrimination on
the subject of this first refusal, until another de-
cision snould have either repealed or confirmed it.
This postponement, therefore, sets aside, for the
time, all difficulties aris.ng, eitherjustly or mjustly,
from the rejection of the treaty, or from the delay
by which it had been preceded, and although the
message begins by enumeiatmg them, I think
proper, in order to confine myself to the matter in
question, only to reply to the imputations made on
account of subsequent occurrences
The reproaches which Piesident Jackson con-
siders himself authorized to address to France,
may be summed up m a few words The King's
Government promised to present the treaty of
July 4th again to the Chambers, as soon as they
could be assembled They were assembled on the
31st of July, and the treaty has rot yet been pre-
sented to them Such is exactly the whole bub-
stance of the Piesident's argumentation, and notn-
mg can be easier than to refute it
I may first observe, that the assembling of the
Chambers on the 31=t July, in obedience to a legal
prescription, that they should be called together
within a Stated period alter a dissolution of the
Chamber of Deputies, was nothing more than a
piece of formalitj , and it Pies dent Jackson had
attended to the internal mechanism of our admin-
istrative system, he would have been convinced
that the session of 1835 could not have really
commenced at that season of 1834 Every one
knew beforehand that after a fouright spent in
the forms of installation, it would be adjourned
The Piesident of 'he United States considers
that the bill relatwe to the Amerk-an claims should
have been presented to the Chamber within that
