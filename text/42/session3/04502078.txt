SOLDIERS 0* WAR OV 1812.
Mr. BOREMAN obtained the Boot.
Mr. PEATT. Will the Senator allow me
to make a report from a committee.
Mr. BOREMAN. Certainly.
Mr. PRATT. The majority of the Commit-
tee on Pensions have directed me to_ report
back without amendment House bill No.
3503 restoring the names of certain persons to.
the pension-roll, and in amendment of an act
entitled "An act granting pensions to the sur-
vivors of the war of 1812, ' approved Febru-
ary 14, 1871.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That is a disputed case.
That does not come in under the understand-
ing.
Mr. PRATT. No, sir.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be placed
on the Calendar.
Mr. ROBERTSON. That bill is on the Cal-
endar now.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Then it cannot
be reported back by the committee if it is on
the Calendar.
Mr. ROBERTSON. It is on page 19.
The VICE PRESIDENT The Senator from
South Carolina states that this bill iB already
on the Calendar, and if it is on the Calendar,
it cannot be reported back.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The Chair misunderstood
the Senator from Indiana. He merely stated
that he' had been directed to report-the bill
back and call the attention of the Senate to it.
Mr. PRATT. That was all.
Mr. EDMUNDS. But that being a dis-
puted case, does not fall within the understand-
ing we had that he might pass pension bills.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from West Virginia has a right to the floor
which would prevent the bill being considered.
WILLIAM SPENCB.
Mr. BOREMAN. I now move, on behalf
of the Senator from Tennessee, [Mr. Brown-
low,] to proceed to the consideration of the
bill (S. No. 1556) for the relief of William
Spence.
The Chief Clerk read the bill! It directs
the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to Wil-
liam Spence, of Murfreesborough, Tennessee,
the sum of $24,290 80, in full satisfaction for
all grain, horses, cattle, mules, and hogs of
the property of Spence, taken, seized, and
used by the military authorities of the United
States during the late war of the rebellion, at
or near Murfreesborough, during the years
1862 and 1863.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That is a case that has
been passed on the Calendar, I think, as an
objected case. It involves the came question
as the Milton Best class of cases, being for
military seizures and destructions, and ex-
poses us to a discussion of all that question.
I should be very glad indeed to accommodate
my honorable friend from Tennessee, but I
think he will see the propriety of letting this
bill go over to the next session.
Mr. BOREMAN. If the Senator will allow
me, it does not involve those questions at all,
as I understand it. I examined the case
thoroughly, and made the report. It is too
long to be read here at this late period of the
session. The claim is for grain, cattle, hogs,
mules, and horses taken and used by the
Army, and is as clearly proven as any case I
ever examined in my life.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That is not the point as
to the amount of proof. A regular warlike
destruction can be easily proved, and proved
very clearly indeed. You can prove any
quantity of them everywhere. I do not
doubt that my friend is entirely sincere when
he says he thinks it does not involve the
questions to which I have referred ; but there
are other Senators who have a different opin-
ion ; and therefore, as it ig one of those mat-
ters of dispute and difficulty, in these last
hours of the session, with so many bills about
which there is no dispute and difficulty, if we
