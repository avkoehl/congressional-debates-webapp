returned yesterday. It was rumored in camp that Ewell's corps, or a part of it, had returned and passed down the railroad last evening. Full rations had been issued up to the time they left. They had not heard of the capture of any of our cavalry; but understood we had taken two regiments of the Alabama brigade, and that they had been recaptured by their cavalry. They report the present strength of their brigade to be 675 for duty. Their regiment can bring but 150 muskets into a fight. Their reason for deserting was that they were tired of the war.

Captain FISHER:

The enemy have finished the work reported yesterday. It is a straight line about 100 yards long, running at right angles with main line. It is one mile and a half north 10 degrees west of this point, and thrown across a road, which I thinks runs from Petersburg to Dinwiddie Court-House. In front of portions of enemy's line they have two lines of abatis. No other change observed.

WARTS,

Signal Officer.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The enemy finished a work thrown across a road about on mile south of Petersburg (or a little east of south). It is a simple earth-work without angles and about 100 yards long. They have placed a second line of abatis in front of portions of their main line opposed to General Warren's position.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Signal Officer.

GENERAL: The signal officer at the plank road has sent no report this morning. He has therefore discovered no movements, as he is perfectly reliable and attentive. I shall go out myself.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,
