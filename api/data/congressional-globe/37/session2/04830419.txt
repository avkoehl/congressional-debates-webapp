THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. SUMNER. Before the question is taken
I wish to make one rejnark.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I did not ask my friend
from Kentucky to give way for a speech from
somebody else 
Mr. SUMNER. I am not going to make a
speech.
Mr. FESSENDEN. And therefore I think it
unreasonable to give way to the Senator from
Massachusetts. If anybody is entitled to the floor
to address the Senate on the subject-matter before
the Senate it is the Senator from Kentucky.
Mr. DAVIS. I insist upon my right, too.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator insists
on his right, and can claim the floor any moment
iie chooscs so to do.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I merely asked the Sen-
ator from Kentucky, supposing the Senate would
probably adjourn, and he would have no objec-
tion to adjourning, whether he would allow me
to put a question to the Senator from Indiana that
he may answer it to-morrow, if he likes.
Mr. DAVIS. Certainly, if I do not lose my
right to the floor.
Mr. FESSENDEN. It is a simple question.
The question which I desired to put to the Sena-
tor from Indiana is one that troubled my mind
somewhat, and I desire an explanation. It is this:
if he did not suppose that war, if it did not exist
at that time, would shortly exist between the con-
federate States, so-called, and the United States,
what occasion did he suppose Mr. Davis, as pres-
ident of the confederate States, could have for fire-
arms ?
Mr. BRIGHT. I have said repeatedly that I
have no recollection of ever having written this
letter. I have no doubt when the letter was asked
for, Mr. Lincoln said he wanted to go there to
dispose of an invention in fire-arms. I understand
Mr. Lincoln says I gave him a letter to Mr. Floyd
in the month of December, which was some time
before I gave him the letter to Mr. Davis, recom-
mending his improvement in fire-arms, whatever
it was; 1 really do not know what it was and never
heard what it was. I went this morning to the
War Department, and with the aid of the chief
clerk searched its files for the purpose of ascer-
taining whether there was such a letter there. The
chief clerk stated that if it was merely a letter of
introduction, such a one as would be given in a
case of that kind, the presumption was that Gov-
ernor Floyd threw it in his basket and so it had
been destroyed, or he might have it among his
private papers. Mr. Lincoln, I understand, says
I gave him a letter first recommending his fire-arm
to Mr. Floyd. If it was such a valuable improve-
ment, and was likely to be so serviceable m the
destruction of human life, and I was m collusion
with the southern States, I would hardly have
lecommendcd it first to Governor Floyd, then
Secretary of War. I suppose I gave him a letter
first to Mr. Floyd, and he, finding that likemany
of these Yankee inventions there was nothing in
it, threw it overboard, and then Mr. Lincoln came
and boied meforasecondlettcrtoJeflerson Davis,
and I gave him that one. I have no doubt those
are the facts.
Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Kentucky is entitled to the floor.
Mr. SUMNER. I believe I have the consent
of that Senator to make a personal explanation,
which will take just a minute.
Mr. DAVIS. I, of course, consent that any
gentleman shall have an opportunity to make a
personal explanation, if it does not forfeit my
right to the floor.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will not do so.
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator from Indiana
alluded to the personal lelations between himself
and me, and he intimated, it he did not charge,
that there had been softie personal question or
personal difference between us. Sir  
Mr. BRIGHT. Mr. President 
Mr. SIJMNER. Excuse me.
Mr. BRIGHT. I intimated no such tlnng, sir.
Mr.SUMNER. Letmefmish. Sir, that is not
the fact. Since I have been a member of this body,
now more than ten years, it has been my tortune
to have taken part in each important question of
public debate. On those occasions I have encoun-
tered, as the records will show, the opposition of
that Senator and of his associates for the time in
this body, now all of them engaged in open rebel-
lion . With that Senator, and with his associates
on those occasions, I never had any personal ques-
tion nor any personal difference. Therefore, when
the Senator presumes to assert the fact, or to make
the suggestion, he goes entirely beyond the record;
and I could not allow this discussion to close to-
night withoutinterposing my positive denial. Sir,
I have approached this question to-day free and
unembarrassed from all personal prejudice. I have
no feeling to that Senator more than I have to any
other member of this body. There has been noth-
ing in our past relations that could induce me to
turn the scales by a feather's weightagainst him.
AMENDMENT OF THE RULES.
Mr. WADE. I believe I have the consent of
the gcntleniaii who has the floor to offer an amend-
ment to the joint rules, which I ask may be
ordered to lie on the table and be printed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Ohio asks the unanimous consent of the Senate,
and with the consent of the Senator from Ken-
tucky, to submit an amendment to the rules. The
Chair hears no objection. The amendment will
be received and ordered to be printed.
โข Mr. FESSENDEN. I will ask the Senator
from Kentucky to give way to a motion to ad-
journ.
Mr. DAVIS. I do.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Then I move that the
Senate adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.

lomatic expenses of the Government for the year
ending 30th June, 1863, and additional appropri-
ations for the year ending 30th June, 1862; with

ask the concurrence of the House.
Also, that the Senate had passed a joint resolu-
tion, authorizing certain officers of the Navy to

ernment; in which he was directed to ask the con-
currence of the House.
Mr. STEVENS. I move to refer the appro-
priation bill, with the Senate amendments just sent
m from the Senate, to the Committee of Ways
and Means.
The motion was agreed to.
NEWSPAPER POSTAGE.
Mri COLFAX. I call for the regular order of
business
The SPEAKER. The regular order of busi-
ness is the call of committees for reports, and as
unfinished business the bill of the House (No.
215) to regulate the carriage of printed matter out-
side the mails, reported from the Committee on the
Post Office and Post Roads, the question being on
its engrossment and third reading.
The bill was read. It provides that from and
after April 1, i860, it shall not be lawful for any
railroad company, express company, common
carrier, or other company or person, to carry for
hire, or forsaleor distribution,upon oralongany
post road or postal route on which the mails of
the United States are now or shall be transported,
any newspapers or periodicals not contained in the
mails of the United States, and on which, if car-
ried in such maijs, postage would be chargeable
bylaw; and that any person or corporation so
oifending shall forfeit and pay to the United States
for each offense the sum of ยง100, to be recovered
by action of qui turn, one half for the use of the
informer, and the other half for the use of the Post
Office Department; but this prohibition shall not
apply to any company, person, or agent who shall
have at any time written authority from the Post
Office Department to carry such matter outside of
the United States mails upon specified routes; and
such license may be granted by the Postmaster
General,uiiderregulations to be by him prescribed
and conditioned upon the due observance thereof,
providing thereby for the payment of rates of post-
age thereon not exceeding the rates now fixed by
law; but this prohibition shall not apply tQ any
mail route upon the seas to foreign countries; and
any package carried otherwise than herein pro-
vided may be seized by any authorized agent or
officer of the Post Office Department, and disposed
of as the Postmaster General shall direct.
The second section authorizes the Postmaster
General, in his discretion, to provide suitable
stamps or labels to be used in carrying this law
into effect, and to regulate the sale thereof,and to
pay for the same out of any funds to the credit o)
the Post Office Department; and provides that any
person using or aiding in the use of such stamps
or labels otherwise than shall by such regulations
be provided, shall be liable to the penalties pre-
scribed in the first section of theact,and to be re-
covered in like manner; and it shall be the duty of
postmasters to receive, bold, and dispose of such
stamps and labels when and as required by the
Postmaster General.
The third section repeals all acts and parts of
acts in conflict with the foregoing provisions; and
provides that nothing contained in the act shall be
construed to interfere with the right of any trav-
eler to have and take with him or her, for his or
her own use, any book, pamphlet, magazine, or
newspaper not intended for sale, distribution, or
delivery to others.
Mr. COLFAX. Mr. Speaker, as this bill is an
importantone,andone thathas beenmostseverely
criticised since its introduction by the most influ-
ential papers in the country, I trust that I may
have the attention of the House while I explain
its provisions, and defend it as far as I can from
the attacks which have been made upon it.
1 think I need not tell the House that this is an
unpopular bill with the great metropolitan press
of the country, and with the newsdealeis who
receive these papers comparatively free from all
charge for carriage. Indeed I tliink the House is
my debtor in one respect for the large quantity
of reading matter which they have had furnished
them of late, for since the introduction of this bill
we have had numerous intelligent and ablepapers
sent to all of us, free of charge, containing criti-
cisms upon the bill marked for our perusal.
But, sir, conscientiously believing that the ob-
jects of the bill are right, and notwithstanding the
vials of condemnation that have been poured out
on me, I stand here to-day for the purpose of vin-
dicating it from the attacks that have been made
upon it, and for the purpose of vindicating the
Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads in
their action in reporting it.
