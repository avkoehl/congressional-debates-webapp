MULBERRY FORK, March 30, 1865-6 a. m.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that the entire train of Second Division will be across the stream in about an hour and, I think, be able to cross Locust Creek by night. The pontoon train will cross as rapidly as possible immediately after Coe's train is over. The river has risen about six inches during the night, and the rains have washed the roads so as to render them almost impassable in many places.

Very respectfully,

WM. E. BROWN,

Captain and Acting Assistant Quartermaster.
