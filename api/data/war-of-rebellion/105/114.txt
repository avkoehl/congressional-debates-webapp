[Inclosure Q.] HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA, Franklin, Tex., September 1, 1862.

COMMANDER OF CONFEDERATE TROOPS, SAN ANTONIO, TEX.:

SIR: I found on my arrival here some twenty-odd sich and wounded soldiers of the C. S. Army, whom I was ordered by General Canby, commanding the Department of New Mexico, to make prisoners of war. These men, at their earnest solicitation, I sent to San Antonio on their parole. They have been furnished with rations of subsistence for forty days and with such medicines and hospital stores as were necessary for them on the road. I have also furnished two wagons for the transportation of those who are unable to walk, and I have sent an escort of one lieutenant and twenty-five rank and file of the First California Volunteer Cavalry to guard them from attack by Mexicans or Indians until a sufficient force from your army is met, to whom they may be transferred, or until they reach some point near San Antonio, where from thence onward they can travel with safety. From that point the lieutenant is ordered to return with his party and all the means of transportation belonging to the United States with which he instructed for the use of his escort and benefit of these prisoners.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
