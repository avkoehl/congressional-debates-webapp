and a he understood the Senator fiom Massachu-
setts (M>- "Webster) ielt a personal interest m its
imm diatecoiisideiation—mending to dclivei his
sentiments on it to-day—he (Mr R ) v ould with-
draw his motion It was, hoy ever, his decided
opinion that (he action demanded of them f n ill
these measures was not simplv and merely to put
the Government in motion again, but to provide
effectual and immediate reuci foi the people in pre-
ference to affording aid, in the first place, to Go-
vernment This object he (Mr R.) thought not
very likely to be promoted by taking up th.s bill,
but, m compliance With the general opinion of \b*
Senate, he should w ithdiaw his motion
Mr WEBSTHR then arose, and delivered hu,
sentiments at large against the Postponement bill
Mr WRIGHT said it might become him to say
a few words in ¡elation to the bill befoie the Seriate
His position in reference to this and othe bills,
pei wps, required him todo so He would, however,
confine himself strictly to the present subject, and
to fie most bnef just fixation ot his own course,
and that of a n ajority of the Committee on Fi-
nance, who had concurred with him in repotting
the bill
Immediately upon the appoir traent of the com-
mittee, and the reference to it of the important
subjects treated of m the Message of the Piesident,
and tbe Report of the Secretarj t f the Tieasoiy,
the committee found that ti e Treasury of the United
Stiteswas, very soon, to be in want of m^ans to
meet the curient demands upon it, w ithout regard
to any furthei transfer to the States They also
found that tins fourth instalment of the deposites
with the States was to become payable on the first
daj of Octobei, and amounted to about nine and
one-thimmi'hons of dollars
The s^ate of the Tiensurj, as developed by the
Report of the Secretir f the Tre^uiv, was is
he ui  lecollected, ami i o thought h c uld not ne
materially mistaken, that, at the time when the
statement appended to that íepoit was made up,
about the first day of the present month, (he be-
lieved the exact dale was the 28th of A.ugust,)
theie was in the Treasury, subject to draft, availa-
ble and unavailable, but cght millions one hun-
dí ed and some Odd thousand dollars The repoit
was printed, and upon the table of everv Senator,
and would verify his correctness in this p?iliculai
This amount was exclusive of the sums ahe?dy
deposited with the States, being some ittentv -eight
millions
To aim e at v hit would be the condit on of the
Tieasui) on the fust of Octibei, the evpe íses of
the present mon'n, which, horn drafts ulreadv
made and anticipated, were estimated at about two
and a half millions, must be deducted from the
tight mi lions, one bundled and odd thousands
thus leaving in the IreaMiij, subject to dialt, on
the first day of Octoler, less than six milhoi s,
without the transfer of a dollar to ihe States
towards the October instalment This, too, in-
cluded all the funds in the Treasuiy subject to
draft foi payments, or iransfeis to the Staler,
w hetliei available or not, upon the drafts of the
Treasurei, the funds on deposite w i h the States not
being taken m o the computation
If, then, the October instalment was to be trans-
ferred to the States, all the means m the Tieasmy
of all descnpt ons on the day when that instalment

loan, to i much greater amount than the deficienct
of those fuñas upon paper w eu'd b lendered in-
dispensable, fiom the unavailable condition of
tcese funds
Still, it would be «een bv the Senate, that this
disposition of the funds in the Treasui}, and of the
public credit, would leave the Ticsury without a
dollar to answer the curient demands upon it The
appropriations foi the >e¿r were hrgc, almost be-
yond example, and ihe cuiren' calls up m the pub-
lic Treasury must be measured b} them Hence
it had been an object of primary interest with the
Secretary to devise the mears for cair}ingcn ihe
Government, and fulfilling ds ob igations to the
public creditors, and m reatnin? that object he had,
a^ he Mr W considered, tt sel y and proper!) , sus-
pended hi^ efforts to make this last transfer to the
States In pursuance of this necessity, he had told
Congress, in h s punted repoit, thatne should make
no movements tottards the accomplishment jf that
object, until the action of Con„ie«s should signify
lis tt ill that that transfer should still be made, and
should provide the means for making it These
facts ariJ conclusions w eie fully btlore the com-
mittee
It then to ame recessaiv for them to sce nnat
w ou'd be the stale of the public Treasury, upon the
supposition that the Octobei instalment of the de-
posite with the States shoulá be w thheld In pio-
secutmg that inquiry, Ihey found that the funds ir
the Treasuiy subj ct todieft, were, to so gieat an
extent, unavailable, that it would be indispensably

At this stage ol (he inqunv, two otner important
inteicsts, both public and private in meir chaiacter,
pressed themselves upon ihe attention of the com
mitlee In any settlement wilh me ¡ale deposite
banks, which should have ptojitr legard to the jne-

of the counti), and to the «ecmitj of the puDlic

mittee were forced to the conclusion that indul-
gence to these institutions, bet ond men legal liabi-

Upon these calculations and hj potheses the billb
ot the committee had been framed, and it was ndw
his duty to give these facts and conclusions rlracti-
eil application to Ihe measure under disiussion.
This was a bill to postpone the October instal-
ment of the transfer to the States If be had been
conect m his statements, and had made himself m-
telhgib'e to the Senate, it would be seen that nothing
existed in the Trea urt out of which this transfer.
could be made, and that nothing wtihiu ils potver
could enable it to make H without the aid of Con-
gress It would also be seen that the whole means
of tne Treasury were inadequate to meet the cur-
ient caH= upon it tt ithout the temporary aid of the
credit of the nation, and that, if a reasonable indul-
gence weie granted to public debtors, (such as the
condition of the countiy and the security of even-
tual collections seemeu to demand,) the use of that
Credit must extend beyond the curient year, and
could, at best, be onl,, eventually met and redeemed
by the means of the Treasury, existing, or in pros-
pect, without a fmther transfer to the States
In view of these facts, Mr W said his own
mud 1 ad been biougbt to this simple and plain
conclusion that the Unite 1 States had no longer
my m ne) s to be safely kept b> the Stales, that if
he October instalment of the transfer irovided for
by the deposite law of 183G was made, the means
to make it must be borrow d upon the credit of the
United Siatc, and "that Congress must place itself
m the singulai poJlioi of using the public credit
to boirow money, m ' ij that it might be safely
kept by the States w hen it was obtained He un-
derstood these piovisions of the depos te law, upon
the r face, to be mere provisions for the safe-
keeping of the public monev He understood this
to be t íe ob eel of (hose v\i o advocated and sup-
p i l 1 i íatt 11 ie t i i f it J assag  In that
sen ele ttas disposed to le^aid it now, and he did
not, therefore, view it as creating any claim in
favor of the States, cr as imposing any debt upon
the United States If, theiefoie, we were called
upon tomorrow mone} to fulfil the provisions of
that law, he could onlt. view it in the light of a
call upon us to bonow mo 105, merely that it
might be safely kept when so borrowed He had
not felt, and could not feel, him«elf authorized to
recommend a loan upon the ciedit of the nation
for such a purpose He believed he spoke the sen-
tí nents 1 f tho e l his colleag íes upon the ermmit-
lei, waen he sua th-u these weie he tietts which
ha' actuated him and them m co isenlmg to report
this bill
