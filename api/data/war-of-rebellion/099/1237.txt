Lieutenant-General HAMPTON, or

General WHEELER,

Winnsborough, S. C.:

Colonel Dibrell, with his regiment, is here awaiting your orders, in consequence of the report of last night being grundless. The enemy is reported to be moving from Monticello to Chesterville. Please answer.

JOHN M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WHITE OAK, February 20, 1865-10 a. m.

General HAMPTON,

Winnsborough, S. C.:

Stevenson moves this morning, via Landsford, Belair, and Pleasant Valley, to Charlotte, where he will await further orders, carrying his own trains. I shall move along the railroad that I may be in telegraphic communication with yourself and the Department. You will now have to guard your own trains, unless you prefer sending them on with General Stevenson's.

Persons arriving from direction of Monticello this afternoon report none of our cavalry guarding that approach. I will leave here in the morning for railroad bridge.

RICHMOND, VA., February 21, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

By mail you will receive a copy of telegram from General Beauregard of a startling character. * Yesterday I sent General Gilmer to advise with General Beauregard. I hope you have given your views as to the mode of concentrating his divided forces; also as to the probable plan of enemy.
