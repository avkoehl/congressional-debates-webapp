Three Iowa regiments are coming soon. The enemy has fallen back from Southwest Missouri, but seems to advance from Pocahontas toward Houston, I advancing from Pilot Knob to Patterson as fast as troops arrive.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., October 15, 1862.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR, Helena, Ark.:

GENERAL: I am obliged to you for slips, papers, reports, &amp;c., showing the whereabouts of the enemy. I am glad to get such papers, and hope you will send me all such intelligence.

I am beginning to move against Steen, McBride, and Parsons, who are near Pocahontas, and trust they will soon move south. fresh troops are promised, and I shall send such to your post, hoping they will not take the ague which the hot season has brought on our Arkansas troops. Meantime I hope your force, forts, and gunboats will hold that point steady.

The enemy is also falling back before Schofield, who still thinks there is some 20,000 under Rains and Coffee and others in his front. Winslow is recovering from a very dangerous and protracted illness.

Major Curtis is down with fever. Major Thomas I. McKenny's horse fell and injured him so he is unable to do much and I am over-worked. Still business goes on.

I am, truly, yours,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
