HENDERSON'S, [October] 31, 1863.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX:

Your dispatch received. I learned to-day all about Burke from Colonel Bulter, who knows him well. He says he is a physician and Campbellite preacher, that he is wholly unreliable, that there is no confidence to be placed in him. He has been reported Union man and has suffered some for his opinions. Colonel Hoskins is at Brabson's. Colonel Graham is in no gander, I think, at Leesburg. If it should turn our that we have to march down the country wqe ought by all means to spare our already worn out horses as much as possible. Of that part of my command I have here there are between 1,000 and 1,200 men who are dismounted or [have] unserviceable horses.

Following two dispatches just received:

HENDERSON'S, [October] 31, 1863.

General WILLOCX:

The Fifth Indiana Cavalry went into Jonesborough to-day; found that three or four rebels [were] in the town. Colonel Graham, in command, says the citizens reported two or three rebel regiments over the hill on the other side of the town. He relies upon the truth of the report. The main body of his regiment is at Leesburg to-night. The rebel Colonel Bottles was buried to-day at Washington College, having died from his wounds.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.

HENDERSON'S, [October] 31, 1863.

General WILLCOX:

Your dispatch received. Colonel Hoskins encamped at Brabson's Mill last night, about three miles and a half beyond Rheatown. The detachment of 100 [of] the Fifth Indiana Cavalry preceded him; was ordered to go into Jonesborough unless the enemy was there. I ordered the balance of the Fifth Indiana Cavalry this morning to proceed to Jonesborough, and if they found no enemy to leave the advance and the main body of the regiment to come back to Lessburg, where Colonel Hoskins has orders to remain where he is until further orders. The scouts reported the enemy in Jonesborough last night.
