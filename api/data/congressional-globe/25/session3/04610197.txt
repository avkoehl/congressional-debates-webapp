and pcrfi rt? Was it left unfinished by the wise
men that made the Constitution ' Or did they
mean that the power cxprasly granted of admitting
new States should cany along with it others of
a bionder and mme unlimited charactei not enu-
merated in the giant?
The Constitution says, " the powers not dele-
gated to the United States, by the Constitution,
nor ptohibited by it to the States, areieserved to
the Sutes respectively, or to the people." Now,
the power to impose conditions upon the new
States is not a delegated power—it can not be found
in the Constitution And if it be nota delegated
powei, by what authority are these conditions
imposed upon us? The compacts, even it they
*nttnded to give such a power, could not do so,
as the powers in the Constitution could not be
enlaiged, altered, or diminished by any compact
or ordinance whatevci.
With these gencial remarks upon the character
and principles of our Government, I shall pio-
ceed toa paiticular examination of those com-
pacts by which it is contended the new States ate
bound But it may be proper to look into the
causes which led to these compacts, befoie ex-
amining the compacts themselves, as calculated
to explain the objects which were to be gained
Befoie and duung the revolutionary war many
of the States laid claim to a vast extent of vacant
tenitory These claims excited murmunng and
discontent among those who had no such claims,
oi whose claims weie not so clear They con-
tended that, as the wai was carried on by the
common sioiifieo of blood and tieasute, the lands
belonging to the Crown of Gicat Butain should,
upon the successful issue of the wai,become the
common propeity of all the States, and go todis-
chaige the debt incuried by the wai io quiet
the discontent that picvailed, and to obviate the
difficulties and troubles that were constantly using
in view, Confess appealed to those Stales that
laid claim to this -vacant temtoiy to cede it to tile
Pedeial G-ovei nment, foi the purpose of vllaying
¿he heartbui mng which wis then conoding the
neace and dtbtuibing thegood feelingof the Con-
federacy JMo cession was made befoie the ap-
peal oí Congiess on the subject, and it is by
leference to the acts of Congress alone that we
"an lightly undeistand the real objects which
'hey had in view in appealing to the States to
make the cession
The fust movement on this subject was the
resolution of the 6th Si ptcmbcr, 17b0 This may

It is unnecessaiy to dwell on the language of
this repoit and resolution. The object is mani-
fest. To pay the debt incurred by the war, and
to silence the murmuring that was beginning to
break forth into audible and serious complaint,
was the design of Congress in making the appeal
to the States On the 10th of October, 1780, Con-
gress again addressed the States on the subject
This resolution, it will be seen, is stronger in its
terms, and moie direct in its meaning, than that
of the 6th September-
" Resohed, That the unappropriated lands that mav he
ceded or relinquished to the United States by anv parttcu
lar State, pursuant to the recommendation ot Congress of
the Gth day of September last, shall be disposed ol for the
common benefit of the United States, and be settled a id
formed into distinct Republican States, which shall become
members ol tile redera! Union, ami have the same kights
OF   SOVEREIGNTY,   FREEDOM,   AID   INDEPENDENCE   AS  THE
other States, that each State which shall be so tormed
shall contain a suitable extent of territory, not less than one
hundred nor mure than one hundred and fifty miles square,
or as near thereto as circumstances will admit That the
necessary and reason ible expenses which any particular
State shall h ive incurred, since the commencement of the
present war, m subduing anv Bntish posts, or maintaining
posts or garrisons within and for the defense, or in acquir
ms anv pait, of the territory that maybe ceded or relin-
quished to the United States, shall be reunbuised "
The language here employed is of a most strik-
ing character. Congress solemnly piomises the
States, upon relinquishing their claims, that the
terntoiy so ceded " shall be settled and formed
into distinct íepublican States, which shall be-
come membeis of the Federal Union, and have
THE SAME RIGHTS OF S0> EUEIGVTY, FREEDOM,
AMD    INDEPENDENCE    AS    THE    OTHER    STATES   "
What weie " the lights of freedom, soveieignty,
and independence" which belonged " to the othei
States" at that time ' How far, and to what ex
tent, weie the old States fiee, sovereign, and m-
dipt ndcut, at this partttului peiiod in thehistoiy

erei<rnty,and independence," which then belonged
to i/iem, is tut? inheiitancc at this day, which can-
not be tiken fiom us by any power on eaith
And the compact with Vnginia does not conflict
with, or in any degiee impair, the rights heie
mentioned In truth, it confitáis all that was
piomised The States not yet complying with
the eai nest appeals that had been made, Congress
again addressed them on the same subject, April
Id, 1783, through the means of a committee ap-
pointed for that purpose, of which Mi Madison
was chairman Still unsuccessful,Congiess made
anothei appetl to the States, in the resolution of
the 29th Api.l, 1784, which is in moie precise
language than the foimer iesolution,as Congiess
explains, in a definite, mannei, what was intended
by the ícsolution of 10th October, 1780 This is
the resolution

therefore, the said States be earnestly pressed, by immedi

and to promote the harmony of the Union "
I would here call the particular attention of the
House to the language that is here employed   It
says-
' Congress h; their resolution of September bth, 1"S0,
having thought it advisable to pit sS upon the Sutes Invin?

What " conditions'" % wl at v as the Union
to be bound on leceivmg such cessions ? Why,
bii, that new States should be made out of the
ternto.ysoccded,whichshouldbe admitted with
" THE SAME RIGHTS OT FREEDOM, SOVEREIGNTY,
AND INDEPENDENCE AS THE OTHER STATES." This
was one of the conditions. The other was, that
the territory ceded should constitute a source of
revenue to pay the debt incurred by the Revolu-
tion. Now, if the conditions were fixed by the
íesolution of October, 1780, by which the Union
should be bound on receiving these cessions, I
ask, how can they be altered oi changed * They
still exist for the benefit of the States that were
to be carved out of this tenitory, and which were
to be admitted into the Union. These resolutions-
show not only the motives tfhich impelled Con-
gress to ask that the cessions should be made,
but also the consideration which was offeied asan
inducement to the States to make the cessions.
These historical facts aie particularly important,
as it is presumable they contain all the leasons
which influenced Congress to address the States
upon the propriety of making the cessions, and
especially as they are antecedent to the cessions,
as well as the Constitution of the United States.
The cessions, upon these earnest and repeated
applications of Congress, were made, and, as it
is my object to examine these deeds of cession
with a rigid scrutiny, to discover if there be any-
thing m them incompatible with the " rights of
fieedom, sovereignty, and independence" Which
weie piomised and guarantied to the States that
might be admitted into the Federal Union, I shall
take up and comment upon the deed of cessiori
made by Virginia, as a sample of the whole
In Heating of these deeds of cession, it must be
boine m mind that they were,compacts made by
and enteied into between two parties, and also
that they were made tiiiitng the existence of the
Aiticles of Confedeiation For, in the examina-
tion of these compacts, it will be found that there
are expiessions in them which cannot be under-
stood without refeience to the Articles of Confed-
eiation.
It cannot be denied that the State making the
cession had the ught to impose the conditions, if
conformable to the Articles of Confederation, and
that the Government accepting them could not
afteiwaids enlarge, add to, oi diminish the terms
of the cession, without the consent of the other
party Being a compact between two pirties, it
required the consent of both to make any altera-
tion What weie the conditions upon which Vir-
ginia ceded her temtoiy ? They were, first, that
the ceded territory should be laid out into distinct
republican States, which should be admitted into
the Union " with the same rights of freedom,
soveieignty, and independence as the other
States," and also that the lands ceded should be a
common fund for the benefit of the United States,
to be disposed of according to then usual respect-
ive propoi lions in the gt neral charge and expcntl-
ltute These are the two impoitant conditioi s
mentioned m the compact with Vnginia, the first
confoiming to and complvmg with the condition*?
that were fixed in the íesolution of Congress of
the 10th ot October, 1780, as explained by tint
of the 29th of April, 1781 It was upon these
conditions that Congress accepted the deed of
cession fiom Vnginu Th( v cannot be altered
without the consult of the othei paity And it,
m the couise of this investigation, it shoultl ba
discotued that in the acts ol Congiess admitting
new States into the Union, there aie othei con-
ditions than those contain d in the deed of ccs
sion, thty aie null and void, because not au-
thonzed by the original died, and the Gential
Government had no power whatever, without the
consent of Virginia, to alter the terms and condi-
tion of the cession.
There is one most remarkable feature in this
deed of cession Virginia not only cedes all her
right, title, and claim to the soii, but to the juris-
diction
Voi the ouipose of calling the attention of the
House to this, point, I will lead the clause that
contains it
