ACWORTH, June 6, 1864.

Major-General BLAIR,

Kingston, Ga.:

Instead of marching via Euharlee and Stilesborough march straight for this place via Cartersville and Allatoona. There is a pontoon bridge at the railroad crossing; leave a regiment at that bridge and relieve Garrard's cavalry, and the balance of a brigade at Allatoona, relieving Stoneman's cavalry. I want you to have ten days' supplies on arrival ready of the Chattahoochee. Now is the time for big licks, so be alive night and day. At the pontoon try and manage that your command crosses between midnight and daylight when it is not occupied by the supply trains. I want to go to Marietta on Wednesday or Thursday and feel down to the Chattahoochee next day. Orders the brigade left at Allatoona to be provided with tools and to intrench both ends of the pass very strong. General McPherson is here with his command.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ROME, GA., June 6, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I am here with my command; neither General Blair nor myself can find any orders concerning my command. Will camp at Kingston to-night with Seventeenth Corps.

ELI LONG,

Colonel, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Acworth, June 6, 1864.

Colonel ELI LONG,

Kingston, Ga.:

I have just ordered Blair to come straight for Acworth, via Etowah railroad bridge, where I have ordered a pontoon bridge. Nevertheless, I want your cavalry, without wagons, to come round by Euharlee and Stilesborough, to cover that flank and to spare the pontoon bridge, which now has more travel than it can accommodate. I want you to be at Garrard's position, near the mouth of Allatoona Pass, early Wednesday morning.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Acworth, Ga., June 6, 1864.

Colonel LONG,

Kingston, Ga.:

Orders were sent to Rome by two staff officers for General Blair's and your commands to come from Kingston to overtake us. Cross the Etowah four miles southeast of Kingston by the Free Bridge, thence to Allatoona by Euharlee and Stilesborough. At Allatoona Pass you will find General Garrard, to whom report for service. I will need all the cavalry at once; so keep your horses in order; feed freely on the wheat and grain fields.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
