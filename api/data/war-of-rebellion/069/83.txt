tion, south is at the creek beyond Athens, where they have, it is reported to me, some dismounted cavalry. Most of my cavalry is on the other side of the river, picketing down the railroad, and on the roads leading into Bowling Green and Milford. I picket the roads leading into Athens from Pole Cat Station and below. Captain Paine has furnished you with complete information, I presume, as to my position. My trains are on this side of the river, except the general trains at Bowling Green. My position here this morning had been made very formidable, and we would have been glad to have received an attack from the whole of Lee' force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Our cavalry have gone to New Bethel Church, as I learn from Major Kerwin, commanding detachment Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, passing along our front. He thinks there is no enemy on my front and right within 3 or 4 miles. He captured three wagon loads of army clothing, bacon, &amp;c., and destroyed them. At the railroad bridge, 3 miles below, I sent some cavalry last night, but they found infantry across the bridge protecting it. The people down there state that Breckinridge's troops ar at Chesterfield, 7 miles from here. I have a very good position. There is an excellent position for a corps on my left, which [is] the most dangerous point I have. General Torbert is pushing the reconnaissances, and clearing the roads, &c. There was a detachment at Guiney's Bridge which, it seems, had better be sent down here, and when Downer's Bridge is covered, there is some cavalry there which might be sent down. If any troops come down on your side of the Mattapony, there is a good road from Bowling Green, and a bridge called Burke's Bridge. I send you a sketch* of our position.
