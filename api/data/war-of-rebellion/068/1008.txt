HEADQUARTERS,Petersburg, May 15, 1864.

The following will be the order of march: Will move in advance on the road west of Swift Creek to Newby's Bridge. There should be a party of mounted men scouting in advance. The regiments will move left in front, Miller's battery in the center. The wagon train will follow General Wise's brigade until General Martin's brigade brings up the rear. A section of General Martin's artillery will follow the wagon train. General Wise will send a guide to General Hill, to conduct General Martin from his present position to the nearest point of the Swift Creek road. The quartermasters are directed to attend to the march of the wagons. They will keep them well closed. On no account will any wagon be permitted to stop on the march to water without the orders of the major-general commanding. The same order is extended to the artillery. The column will be kept well closed, the regiments at the proper distance of 22 paces apart as in brigades [sic].
