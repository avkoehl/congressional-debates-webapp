HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, May 9, 1864-7 a. m.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

Colonel Mitchell attempted to destroy the lower dam. They are made by filling the railroad culverts with stones, logs, earth, &amp;c. The work was too much for him. He says the rebels were moving artillery for a considerable time during the latter part of the night; he thinks from their right to their left. Too much fog yet.

Respectfully,JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.

I see from here a column of troops moving along the crest of Rocky Face, north. They must now be very near your advance. The number seems to be large.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,
