Major G. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Fiske, at Donaldsonville, telegraphs that it is current in Plaquemine that General Taylor is crossing the Atchafalaya with a large force. Deserters to-day report Colonel Bush has gone up the Teche with the Fourth Louisiana Cavalry. The prevailing impression is that General Taylor is east of the Mississippi and Walker is in command.
