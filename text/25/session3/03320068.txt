interest, inducing a laxity of public morals, and
violating at least the spurt of a constitutional pro
hibition, let this leading point at issue between
the parties be fairly met, and the resuU is not, and
cannot, be doubtful
Do gentlemen expect to subserve party purposes
by this onset, this effort to charge upon the pres-
ent Administration all defalcations that have ever
happened under our Government, and by a dis-
play of declamatory invective and wholesale
charges of "corruption," to divert public atten-
tion from the true issue > There may be m all this
some political skill,some party tact,but I can tell
gentlemen that the plan will not succeed, either in
battering down the Administration, or in diverting
public attention from those reform measures rec-
ommended in the message, and necessary to pre-
Tent those evils which belong to the system to
which the gentlemen adhere. They cannot, by
playing the old game of proposing nothing and
etjdiavor.ng to defeat everything, avoid responsi-
bility to the people, or prevent them from per-
ceiving the obvious and palpable necessity of "an
' early enactment, similar to that of other coun-
' tries, by which the application of public money
* by an officer of the Government to private uses,
' should be made a felony and visited with severe
•and ignominious punishment," as recommended
by the President This measuie they will not,
they dare not, directly oppose And, sir, this
point gained, this principle established, and gen-
tlemen will find it extremely difficult to convince
the people, the farmers, the laboring class, those
who have no selfish purpose to subserve in this
matter,but look only to the general good, that the
same rule in this respect should notapply to banks
that you apply to individuals, that these should
be the special favorites of Government, privileged
more than others,and especially after the lament-
able consequences so recently experienced by em-
ploying them as depositories, and giving them for
banking purposes, the use and control of the pub-
he money. It will be difficult to persuade the
honest, intelligent yeomanry of the country why
corporations should be privileged to do that, for
their own profit and advantage, which you declare
to be a felony if done by an individual, subjecting
him to a severe and ignominious punishment
To prevent banks as well as individuals fiom
using the public money for their own benefit, is,
then, but the second step which naturally and ne-
cessanly follows in this financial ieform,a refoim
which distinguishes the policy of the present Ad
ministration And this principle, carried out and
made applicable alike to all who may be intrusted
with the keeping of the public money, as it must
and will be, and you have but one step further in
the process of restoring the financial system of the
Government to its original constitutional track,
you have but to confine the custody of the public
money to such officers of the Government as shall
be constitutionally appointed and responsible to
the people And, to settle this latter point, I
apprehend there would be less difficulty, because
patriotism would occupy the place of self interest,
which would be excluded,and it would be chiefly j
a question of safety and constitutional pnnciple     |
Mi  Speaker, notwithstanding what may have
been said in favor of the supeuor advantages, in i
point of safety, of employing banks as depocito-
riesof the puolic money, Í believe it is susceptible
of the clearest proof that the public loss has been
far greater from this source than fiom individual
defalcations    At the last session of Congiess we
had a statement from the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, giving a comparative estimate, by which it
appears that the loss sustained by bank failures
exceeded $1,000,000, while that from individuals
fell short of that amount, and this without any
of those safeguards and securities which it is now ,
pioposed   to supply, and let  it be remembered I
that this estimate was independent of the loss of
$5,580,000, by taking depreciated bank paner m
the years 1814, 1815, 1816, and 1817     What
amount, if any, will be finally lost of the deposits |
m the  banks at the time of the suspension of
specie payments remains to be seen     But inde-
pendent of that, when you take into account the 1
expense incurred by the  necessity of an extra
session of Congiess, and the interest to be paid 1
on Treasury notes, the issue of which was rendered I
necessary by the failure of the banks to fulfill their
obligations to the Government, and the amount
will swell to a vast sum chargeable to the loss
account, by the use of banks as depositories of
the public moneys Why, sir, I would inquire,
aie gentlemen so silent upon bank defaults) s, which
have inflicted so great evils upon the country,
while they are so loud and eloquent in their de
nunciation of individual defalcations' How long
is it, sn, since the deposit banks, " pet banks,"
the "corrupt and corrupting system," was the
theme of eloquent and bitter invective and denun-
ciation' But now, since the system has exploded,
and inflicted the most severe injuries upon the
Government and the people, when there is some-
thing tangible of which we may justly complain,
all with them is silent, not a word of complaint is
uttered Why is this, sir? Is it because the
"pet banks" have taken refuge in the ranks of
their pursuers' Is it because they are found, in
the main, efficient auxiliaries in the war upon the
Administration> Is it because the system is found
a pretty good half way house, in which they hope
to recruit their strength for their final destination—
the marble palace3
But, Mr Speaker, the question of loss sustained
by the bank deposit system dwindles into com-
parative insignificance when compared with its
evils in other respects The influence it has in
deranging the currency, by contributing to exces-
sive bank issues and sudden contractions, the
stimulus it gives to speculation and extiavagance,
with all their demoralizing influences, its effects
upon legislation, encouraging high duties and ex-
travagant appropriations, and the natuial conse
quence of bringing the money power into our
political contests, and to bear upon the purity of
our elections, with all its corrupting tendencies
These, sir, are evils of a character that admit of
no estimate by mere dollars and cents, and should
awaken the attention of every friend to the per-
manent prosperity of the country, and the purity
of its institutions
Thedefalcations and fiauds upon the Treasury,
now so justly complained of, have doubtless,
some of them at least, had their origin in the spec
ulatmg mania, encouraged to its wildest extent by
the bank deposit system Look at the Swartwout
case, and at what period do you find his indebted-
ness to the Government swelling with thegreatest
rapidity to the largest amount > Why, sn, it was
in those yeais when your surplus money in the
banks was increasing to some thirty or forty mil-
lions of dollars, ministering to and urging on the
speculating mania, which swept over the land with
the contagion of a desolating pestilence Pel haps
nothing can more forcibly exhibit the extent to
which this excitement was carried than the aston
ishing fact that, during the yeais 1835 and 1836,
there were sold of your public lands more than
two fifths of the entire amount of sales since the
oigamzation of the Government Prom a report
of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
it appears that the whole amount paid into the
Treasury from sales of the public lands, since the
land sales first commenced to the 30th September,
1837, was ¡J94,496,543, and of this amount there
was paid in the yeais 1835 and 1836, $39,399,580,
whereas, previous to that time,the amountseldom
exceeded $2 000,000 a year, and generally fell
much short of that sum That the use made of
the public money by the banks was mainly instru-
mental in producing these results, was charged
upon this floor by those gentlemen who are now in
favor of continuing to the banks this pnvilege. It
was justly complained that the money was loaned
out to speculators to buy up the public domain, and
thus leturned into the Tieasury again, to perforin
the same office, and to prevent this, the Secretary
of the Treasury issued the much abused specie
cucular
Mi BO^D here called the attention of Mr T
to a letter of the Secietary of the Treasury [Mr
Taney] advising the deposit banks to discount
upon the public money
Mr TAYLOR continued Sn, I well remem-
ber that let'er, and the circumstances under which
it was written, for it is a period in the history of
this country not soon to be foigotten it was
after the deposits weie removed from the Bank
of the United States, and when the effort was
making to produce a. panic and pressure in the
money market, when the bank commenced the
curtailment of its discounts, and predictions of
distress and rum, from the scarcity of money,
was heard from the Opposition in every quarter,
that the Secretary, to prevent, as far as possible,
the fulfillment of these predictions, and the de-
signs of the bank party, encouiaged the banks to
more liberal discounts upon the public deposits,
a id surely, if anything could justify such a
course, it was the circumstances under which the
advice was issued But, su, 1 was about to show
how the Swartwout defalcation appeared con-
nected with the speculating excitement, and pro-
gressed with it Fiom a report laid upon our
table, it appears that this defalcation commenced
from a small beginning in 1830, and gradually in-
creased until, in 1834, it had reached the amount
of $50 370, in 1835, when your surplus deposits
in the banks were essentially aiding and contribu-
ting' to the excessive expansion of bank circula-
tion, and kindling up the wild spirit of speculation,
it increased to $86 000, m 1836, about #200,000,
and in 1837 more than $680,000' thus keeping
pace with the speculations and extravagance of
the times Perhaps this case, like many others,
in its incipient stage, might plead the excuse of
honest intention, the design of replacing what had
been withdrawn, but as it advanced, and the
golden harvest fiom imagined profitable invest-
ment dazzled before the eye of the collector, re-
course was had to artfully contrived deception
and fraudulent concealment, and he was swept
along in the broad current of extravagance and
speculation which was bearing rapidly along it 
thousands to misery and rum He may, perhaps,
have consoled himself under the turpitude of his
official perjuiy by the íeflection that he was vio-
lating no law that regarded his offense as a crime,
subjecting him to an ignominious punishment,
that, at most, it was legally but an indebtedness
to the Government, and that, in using some por-
tion of the public money for the benefit of himself
and friends, he was but doing that which was per-
mitted the banks to do, if paid over to them
But, Mr Speakei, however detective the sys
tern may be under which this defalcation has hap
pened, nothing can excuse or palliate the moral
turpitude of so gross a fraud upon the Treasury,
and so base and ungrateful abuse of public trust
and confidence And while I will raise my voice
as loud as the loudest in condemning this and all
similar cases, and give my aid to raise a commit-
tee for a thoiough investigation, I should deem
myself unfaithful to the trust reposed in me, if I
did not turn my attention to some lemedy for
those defects of law, which have enabled public
agents to perpetrate these frauds with impunity,
and lend my feeble effoits to change a system
which has inflicted upon the country evils of a far
more aggravated character, and resulted, not only
in direct heavy losses by bank defaulters, but in
one grand explosion, involving both Government
and people in the most serious embarrassment
and difficulty, and to ray mind the remedy is plain
and simple Apply the knife to the root of the
disease, to that cancer which is poisoning the
body politic, cut entirely the connection between
the banlcs and the financial operations of the Gov-
ernment, so as to remove all necessity for any
dependence upon them on the part of the Govern-
ment, and all inducement to political influence on
their part, take away the temptation for honest
men to become rogues, and put it out of the power
of logues to cheat the pubhc,and escape unwmpped
of justice, make it a penal offense, criminal legally
as it is morally, for any one to convert the public
money to his own use for any purpose whatever,
and establish such guards and checks as shall
make it secure, and frauds of easy detection, and
you will have discharged an important duty and
rendered the country an essential service These
are measures that are identified with the policy of
the present Administration, and which recom-
mend themselves to our immediate action from the
highest consideration of public duty But if gen-
tlemen of the Opposition,who appear to have in this
House a majority, at least upon some of the most
important questions connected with the finances,
shall refuse their aid in the establishment of a
more safe and secure system for the collection and
