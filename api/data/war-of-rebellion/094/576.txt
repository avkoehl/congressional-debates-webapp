Abandoned farther pursuit of Lyon near Paint Rock this a. m. The streams were impassable. There are squads of rebels that have crossed to opposite side of Paint Rock and are in woods near the bank of it, and a few squads still higher up, but the whole organization is reported broken up. A citizens says that Major Chenoweth crossed railroad near Woodville with 150. The residue of Lyon's command is beyond Paint Rock, near the mount. Could not ascertain truth of this.
