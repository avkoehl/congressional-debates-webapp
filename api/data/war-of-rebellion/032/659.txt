COLONEL: A soldier just in, who was released by the enemy 4 miles this side of Carthage at 9 o'clock this morning, states that he heard their guns firing at Carthage; that part would go by Greenfield; all were destined for Jackson County, and were taking away all the wagons they could find. They are going to take their plunder out. We will move rapidly, via Brownsville, to-night, to Greenfield. Our subsistence should meet us on the 7th or night of 6th. You can send the artillery, via Mount Vernon, to Greenfield, which do rapidly, if possible.
