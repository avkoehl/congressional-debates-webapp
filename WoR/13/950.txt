
enemy's pickets, three mounted, near. As five infantry regiments were reported to be at this point I ordered the cavalry to endeavor

to capture the pickets, but they failed after a pursuit of about a mile. No infantry force was to be seen in the neighborhood. Three dismounted men had shown themselves at the same point as the first picket, and were supposed to be the same. The picket fired one shot at us before leaving.

From an examination of the ground in front I am confident there is no force within 4 miles of the point marked D, and that the pickets are from a force considerably to the interior, my own impression being Petersburg, judging from the inclosed envelope, the letter inside of which was dated June 17, 1862.

As it was late in the afternoon and my men very much exhausted from heat, the weather being excessively hot, I determined to return, and after the usual delay at the landing I arrived in this camp at 8.30 p. m. The assistant surgeon with my command reports twenty cases of sunstroke as having occurred during the time we were absent.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN D. WILKINS,

Captain, Third Infantry, Commanding Regiment.
