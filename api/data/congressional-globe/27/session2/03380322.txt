Mr. REYNOLDS lose to address the commiltee, and began
by expressing his great joy and satisfaction at hearing his
worthy friend from Kentucky, [Mr Owsley ] and though they
might differ a little as to this little salary, that made no manner
of odds it never should make any difference with him m his
feelings towards any individual Mr R said that when this
little office had first been created the patents were nearly six
years m arrears, and it had been productive of great good He
was well aware that every individual m that House wanted to
retrei ch the expenses of Government, wherevei it could pro
perly be done. His worthy friends on both sides of the House
were anxious for this, he was very sure, and this, no matter
whether an individuaron the stump, had pledged himself to
retrenchment and reform or not Now he felt assured that all
would admit, especially h« woithy friends from the West,
that it was of more consequence that the land patents of their
constituents should be signed than that this little capital against
the President, or somebody, he did not know who
The people of the West, as every one knew, had a mon
strous amount of these land titles which required signature,
and, in fact, wherr the Government sold an individual his
land, it did virtually enter into contract to give that individual
the legal evidence of his title—a patent bigned according to
law Now, if the Pte&ident tould sign all these patents him
self, it was very we] I, that was all any gentleman wanted If
this could be shown by his worthy friend from Kentucky, or
by any other individual, then Mr R would go with gentle men
to abolish this tittle office of Piesident's Secretary He was
for economy, for retrenchment, and for reform, as he hoped
every worthy friend of his on both sides was and he had no
doubt of it Let every individual go for retrenching offices
wheie it could be done rightly, let every gentleman do what
ever he believed in his conscience to be right, but then do not
Jet wot thy gentlemen cany their retrenchment so very close as
to retienen every thing to death no individual, he wasconfi
dent, could desire this He would say to gentlemen, if you are
sure you are riant, go it, certainly, whenever an individual
thought retrenchment reasonable and right, let him go it by
ail means                                                                                 !
Mr rjLLRÍORE pressed for a vote Gentlemen were mis
taken if they thought this a proposal to abolish this office The
House had no power to abolish any office created by law They
might, to be sure, withhold the salary attached to it, and they
might, ¡f they thought it more expedient, impose this duty on
the Commis*nonei of the General land Office which perhaps
might be proper enough But he thought it looked fike a very
small attack on an officer hkt this, whose salary was no gieat
object But, besides this, a consequence might follow which
gentlemen did not anticipate The law now lequired patents
to be signed by this officei,and should they, while tint law con
tinuesm force, be signed by the Pie&ident m per&ori, it might
raise a question as to the valí hty of the land title Mi F
hoped the 7tem would not le stricken out
Mi HABERSHAM moved that the committee use, but the
motion was lost—ayes-62, noes 67
Mr H thenobseived that the appropuation under consideia
tion was for the salary of an officer regularly nominated by the
Pie&ident of the Tinned States and conffimed t y the Senate an
officer holfhnCT his office by foice of law This case did not rest
on the same principle as the other amendments which had been
made to the bill, and they formed no piecedent for it Mi H
wia in favor of retienrhrrent, but he was notf i pushm  it in
this way I et the appropriation be m ide to meet the 1 uv and
if the law was deemed to be inexpedient Itt it he lepeiled A
part of the salary of tin* officer was now due and ifthe appro
priation wis put out of this bill, it must be put into some other

Mr HOWARD could not agieewith the gentleman from
New Yoik [Mr Tillmore] in the opinion that patents now
signed by the President's own hand could be invalid he did
not so understand the Jaw It was as much tie Piesident's
duty now as ever to sign these la d titles, and if be did not it
was incumbent on him to see them legally signed by anothei
Ihe law for thjs secretary was pa-sedin 1¿33, and between that
time and the year 1810 u had been found that the secretary of
the 1 ue Pi esident had affixed his name to these titles not by sig
natuie with a ptn, but by Ubing types, and thus, printing n
m consequence of which a very hrge cfsss of patento" on
which the titles of the estates of thou-sands ot individuals' de
pended, were found to be void It wis the duty of the
President to sign these instruments, and not have bis name
fixed to them by priming, but he bad not only had this dore
but done by a third peison, not the ofticei appointed for that
purpose, in consequence of which, the instruments weie all void
and Congress in 1841 had to go into new legislation to cover this
defect, and make such titles good in Uw Mi II thought the
office might properly be abolished, though, while it continued
he would not withhold the salary                                                 '
Mi WI*3E said he did not know exactly what the o-ent'ei Tin
fiom Michigan [Mr Howarp] alio led to He waa sure thar the

validity of the President's signature so long i;, there wa<-ar o
