of the army is upon the right fortifying and that they are only keeping up a skeleton line of the center. His brigade, he thinks, is on the right of the Jerusalem plank road, extending just across it. He thinks Mahone's division lies principally to the right of the plank road; cannot say what troops are to the left of the plank road extending toward Beauregard, but thinks Mahone's old brigade is in there somewhere; has not much intelligence. His regiment is 161 men bearing arms. His company, the largest in his regiment, has twenty-one men for duty. From his estimates of the other regiments in the brigade, Sanders' strength is about 800 men. No news of Early's defeat has yet reached the army.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. BABCOCK.
