Mr. BINGHAM. I ask the gentleman from
Indiana to allow me to suggest an amendment for
the purpose of making clear the legal effect of the
second section of thesubstitute which he proposes.
Mr. PORTER. I shall be compelled to decline
the request of the gentleman from Ohio. If I open
the way for one I must admit all. I respectfully,
therefore, decline to yield.
Mr. BINGHAM. My only purpose was to
suggest an amendment for the purpose of carry-
ing out what evidently is his object in the second
section of the bill.
Mr. HICKMAN. I rise to a question of order.
This is not tho time to offer amendments. There
has been no reconsideration, and it is not compe-
tent, therefore, for any amendment to be offered.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks the ques-
tion of order cannot be raised until some amend-
ment is proposed to be offered.
Mr. HICKMAN. Tho gentleman from Ohio
desired to offer an amendment, as I undeistood.
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not so under-
stand him.
Mr. PORTER. While I cannot give way to the
gentleman from Ohio to offer an amendment, I am
willing to hear his suggestion.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. I rise to a
question of order. I do not understand that it is
in order for the gentleman to yield tlii floor, and
I must object to any proceeding that is not strictly
in order.
Mr. DAWES. I should like to make an in-
quiry of tho gentleman from Indiana.
Mr. HICKMAN. I object to the gentleman
from Indiana giving way for any purpose what-
ever, unless he does it unconditionally.
Mr. DAWES. I was merely going to make
the inquiry whether I understood the gentleman
from Indiana correctly to indicate his purpose not
to permit any amendment whatever to his propo-
sition.
Mr. BINGHAM. I mustobjectto any.inquiry.
If the gentleman from Indiana'cannotbe permitted
to yield to ono side,J object to his yielding to the
other.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. I willmerely
say that I am willing that there shall be a free in-
quiry, if the question can be opened to all of us.
Mr. DAWES. I wish to say, with the consent
of my friend from Ohio 
Mr. BINGHAM. I object.
Mr. PORTER. The question having been put
by the gentleman from Massachusetts,! have the
right, notwithstanding it may have been out ol
order, to answer it. I will, therefore, say that it
is not my purpose at this time to receive amend-
ments, nor do 1 suppose that any amendment is
in order. My purpose is, if the motion to recon-
sider shall prevail, to move to recommit tho bill
to the special committee, with instructions to re-
port the substitute which has been read at the
Clerk's desk, unless it shall be the desire of the
House to act finally upon it at this time. When
that substitute shall have been reported, it will be
within the discretion of the House to receive or
refuse amendments.
Mr. Speaker, I have said that the purpose of this
bill was to strike an effective blow at the leaders
of this rebellion, but not at the same time, like the
bill reported by the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, to menace or disturb the constitutional rights
of the loyal citizens of the slaveholding States. I
have said that its purpose was to deprive the lead-
ers of this rebellion of their property in slaves,
but at the same time not to destroy the security of
the domestic institutions of any of the slavehold-
ing States.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. Will tho gentleman allow
me to ask him a question?
Mr. HICKMAN. 1 object.
Mr. PORTER. The point of order having
been made, I must decline to yield to anybody.
I do not affect to disguise, sir, that if the sub-
stitute which I have indicated shall be enacted,
will operate to emancipate a very large number of
slaves. Nor, sir, do I doubt that it will quite nearly,
if not altogether, destroy the institution of slavery
as a mere political and governing power. Nor is
that to be lamented. But it will not destroy it as
adomcsticinstitution,nor impair,in any way,the
rights of the loyal people ofthe slavehoIdingStates.
I think there are few persons of sober judgment
who will not now admit that if the institution of
slavery had not been wielded, as it has been for
the last few years, as a political power, it would
have been far more secure, and that the interests
of those concerned in it will be best subserved by
forever withdrawing it from the fields of political
strife. The emancipation of the large number of
slaves who would be set free by the operation of
the substitute which has been read, would not tend,
if allowed to take place peacefully, to weaken or
imperil the rights of loyal men in the slaveholding
States to persons hold to'service, nor disturb their
industrial interests, nor loosen the foundations of
social order. A conspicuous proof of the truth of
this assertion is furnished by the State of Mary-
land. With the exception of a partial insecurity
in that part of the State next to an extensive bor-
der upon a free State, arising from facilities of es-
cape, there is no State in which slaves arc held more
securely than in the State of Maryland. Yet, ac-
cording to the census of 1860, with a slave pop-
ulation of eighty-seven thousand one hundred and
eighty-eight, she has a free colored population ot
eighty-three thousand seven hundred and eighteen.
One half, therefore, within a small fraction, of the
colored population of that State are free. Yet who
has ever heard that the presence of that free pop-
ulation has excited uneasiness or alarm among the
owneis of slaves, or has weakened the tenure by
which slaves are held to service, or has injured
the industrial interests of the State ?
In 1859, when the slavery agitation was at its
height, there was held in Baltimore what was dis-
tinctly known as the " slaveholders' convention
of the State of Maryland." It whs a large assem-
blage, and none but slaveholders were admitted as
members. A resolution that the Legislature of the
State should be requested,atitsnextsession there-
after, " to terminate free-negroism in Maryland a'
