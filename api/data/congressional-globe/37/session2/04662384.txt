THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 27.
ble magnificence, the Bourbons of France surrounded by
the splendors of the Tmllenes, the Stuaifs ot England
clinging to their maxims of kingcraft, lustful tyrants, de-
bauched princes, and dishonest statesmen of aJ! ages and
every clime have all talked wisely and profoundly of the
sweets ami cmnforts which flow to the people from that
fountain of bitter waters—a great public debt."
Flushed with this success, and having disposed
of this enormous sum in a permanent public debt,
he turns to the annua! expenses which will there-
upon accrue, and must be met by the Government.
The statement shall be given in his own words,
together with his asseverations of its correct-
ness:
" I will content myself with a specific statement of the
various items of cunentyeaily expense which musibeieg-
ulai ly met. Against the substantial correctness of this state-
ment I challenge successtul contradiction.
" The interest, on the public debt, ata very low estimate,
{$100,000,1)00. The ordinary expenses of the Government,
including appropriations for the mcicased magnitude ot the
Aimy and Navy afiei the war is ovei, will reach §150.000,000
at anothei low estimate. I am especially wan anted hi tid-
ing tins amount, m view of thedeclaiation on this flooi,by
the cliaumanot the Committee on Military Allans, [Mr.
Blair, of Mis-sou* i,J that heieulter our peace establishment
will consist ota standing Army ofa hundied thousand men.
u The pension Ji t comes ne\t." * * * * ''Jt
is of eouise difficult to calculate the amount which will be
required to meet this item ot expense; but no well lnfoimed
person will pretend that it will be less than the sum of
$100,000,000.
To the above must be added at least .$50,000,000 more
as a margin lor claims against the Government, contingent
expenses and unloieseen events during this convulsive and
untitled period of the world's history.
tk We have thus an inevitable annual expenditure, without
making any piovi-ion whatever foi thepavment of'the pub-
lic debt itself, of the sum ot $-100,000,000. This amount
will make its demands <m the le-suurces of the people in
each succeeding yoar,a^ regularly a* the seasons come and
go, and in a voice as imperative and incxoiahle as the cry
ot fate. You need not aveityour tnglitened gaze fiom the
sore contemplation ot this temble t.ict."
Availing himself still further of that wonderful
arithmetic which has brought him to these re-
sults, he divides the indebtedness of to-day among
all the voters of the country; then aggregates it
again upon his own State of Indiana, and then
again subdivides it upon his own district, with a
dexterity so wonderful, that anything short of a
quotation would be cruel injustice. "But,again,"
says he,
u By the censiH report from which I have j««;t quoted
we find ih,u the population ot the United States in the year
J800 was u little inoi<; than tlmty millions Ot this popula-
tion about live million* aio voters. A moment's*calcula-
tion in the simplest rules of aiithrnetic '•how- that each in-
dividual volet ot'the-e five millions i«, in debt to-day ,<200
on account of Jits proportion of the national expend'*, and
that one yeai hence he will he m debt $100 on the same
account. The liability of my own gre \t State of Indiana,
aecouling to the rule ol Minion which ha* boon enacted
ag.unM hei by the present Cougre^, will be ^100,000.000,
ol which enonnous Miin the people of the disirict which 1
have the honor to i epre«,ent will stand ciuugcd with some-
thing ovci twelve millions of doll.us,."
1 have, thus reproduced from the speech of the
gentleman irom^ Indiana, [Mr Voorheek,] that
it may be fresh in your minds, so much of it as
I shall probably have time to notice. Whatever
else the speech contains is built upon these asser-
tions, and when they are shown to be without
foundation, the rest fails with them. If, there-
lore, the House will give its ear for a short time
to a di y detail of figures and statistics, I will show
how utterly groundless are the statements of the
gentleman f'iom Indiana touching the expendi-
tures and liabilities of the Government.
It Will lie observed, by referring again to the
beginning of these extracts, that the gentleman
himself distrusts the entue accuracy of his own
statements. "[ piesume, sir," says he, " that
no one can, at this time, with entire accuracy,es-
timate the amount of our public debt." Indeed,
he goes fuithur,nnd charges "an unusual silence
in official cju.uters in regard to the extent of the
Government liabilities."
What ground or foundation there was for the
gentleman to say that there was an un usual silence
(rovernnv nt officials m regard to
the liabilities of the nation, he does not inform
us. A still fuuher reference to the speech will
show that the key-note of the whole was, that it
was to be a revelation—a revelation of something
to the revelation. Availing lmnsrif of a
statement made on the floor of the House by the
chairman of the Commutes of Ways and Means
as to the amount of daily expenditures at a par-
ticular period, he shows the full extent of the cal-
culations upon which he proposes to make this
alarming revelation to be the simple multiplica-
tion of §3,000,000 by three hundred and sixty-five
—the number of days in the year—showing a prod-
uct of §1,095,000,000; and therefore he declared
it might safely be stated that our present indebt-
edness amounted to tha't sum. As if it followed
that because the expenditure of one day was
$3,000,000, it was the same every day of the year.
If the gentleman had consulted the proper officials
I have no doubt that he would have omitted to
say that there was an unusual silence on the part
of Government officials as to the amount of the
expenditures or the public debt. On consultation
the next day after he made his speech, I was en-
abled to learn, and now have before me, from such
authority as does not admit of denial, a specifica-
tion of every dollar that has been expended by
this nation since the incoming of the present Ad-
ministration. I also have a statement of every
dollar expended up to Thursday of last week, and
of every dollar of the public indebtedness from
ail sources up to the Friday of last week. The
accuracy of these figures any one can test by ap-
plication at the Treasury Department. I put them
against all loose statements in debate, however
honestly made. If the committee will listen to
these dry statements, I hope I will be able to sat-
isfy even my friend from Indiana that the reve-
lations of his arithmetic have failed him, because
they were based upon error:

perhaps the next month, as requisitions for pay are now
mostly satisfied, will not probably exceed $1,000,000 per

a long period ahead.
