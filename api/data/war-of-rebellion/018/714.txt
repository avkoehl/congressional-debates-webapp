Major General H. W. HALLECK:

The following dispatch has just been received:

BARNETT'S FORD, August 27, 1862 - 10.45 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

Immediately after sending my last dispatch I ordered the scouts at Kelly's Ford, 7 miles distant, to precede to Rappahannock Station and obtain reliable information. They have just returned, and report no enemy and the place deserted. The scouts I ordered across the river, in compliance with General Parke's dispatch, have also returned, and report no enemy for several miles toward Brandy Station. General Morell has left a quantity of stores and ammunition at Mount Holly Church, near Kelly's Ford, which he requests you will send for; also stores turned over to me by General Griffin at this post. I have now scouts across the river, 7 miles on Culpeper road. I have but 42 men in camp; the rest all on duty. McIntyre has not arrived at Kelly's Ford as yet.

DEVIN,

Colonel.

This is the latest news I have.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I have also just received the following:

BARNETT'S FORD - 9 a. m.

General BURNSIDE:

At 6 o'clock last evening I dispatched Lieutenant Easton, with 6 men, with instructions to cross the river here and proceed as far as possible on the Culpeper road and then conceal himself, for the purpose of watching movements of the enemy during the night. He reports on his return the same force of cavalry camped about 12 miles from here and the forces of all arms still at Stevensburg. The pickets of the enemy were at the intersection of Kelly's and Germanna Ford road with the Culpeper road. their scouts patrol the road to within a mile of my pickets across the river, distant from here about 2 miles. Everything quiet this morning at Kelly's.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. C. DEVIN,

Commanding Sixth New York Cavalry.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 28, 1862 - 11.35 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

All is quiet at our advance telegraph station up the river. We have nothing from General Pope's column since 7 p. m. yesterday, at which time the forces remained in the same positions as were indicated by my dispatch of yesterday afternoon. Meagher's brigade is here, and I have ordered it down to Aquia Creek to re-embark, in compliance with an order from General Sumner. There are indications of a considerable force in our front in the direction of Spotsylvania Court-House. We continue to hold Fredericksburg and all the fords. Nothing but cavalry at the upper fords. I have just sent you a dispatch from Colonel Devin that will show the condition of things at these fords. I am sending to Aquia Creek all surplus baggage and stores. I await your further instructions. Our scouting parties are out in all directions.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
