This point and our depots at Devall's Bluff and the railroad will be kept secure. I can whip any force sent here by the enemy. Colonel Ryan, Third Arkansas Cavalry, has returned. I send him to Lewisburg, and Lieutenant-Colonel Fuller I have sent to command at Dardanelle. The Third Wisconsin Cavalry, Lieutenant-Colonel Calkins, will arrive here in a few days, and expect to be mustered as veterans and will want to go home. They are now at Dardanelle. If horses do not arrive soon I will take such as I can find here in the hands of citizens to mount the cavalry, and then the guerrillas must make away with themselves.

Hoping success may be yours, I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
