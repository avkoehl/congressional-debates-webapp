General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

This is the way the rebels report the position of the gun-boats. The following message was intercepted at 10.30 a. m.:

Colonel B and A:

The heavy firing heard last night was all, except a few guns, from Battery F, in Steuart's front, on Terry's front, at our left. A good deal of picket-firing toward the James. Afterward a gun-boat near Dutch Gap opened, and was answered by our batteries at Howlett's and Bishop's. The firing was brought on by an attempt of Terry, on our left, on Saturday last, to advance his picket-line. From C: No change on hand or noticed.
