*A Such motion having been agreed to (witnott a divi i n)—
Inecomin ttee ie0umed the consideration ol the bill liomthe
■?e late to uicoi porate the irtbscubers to a Fiscal Lank of the
I 11 ed states
1 he j endmff question being on the motion of Mi   McCíul
/an ol New \olk   ti s nke out the enacting clause ihereu!—
\I    IOHN F   MA 0\ (.who was entitled to the floor) ad
dies ed the committee, dunng the hour, in opposition to the bill
i ne points of hi  aigumem wore a  follows
Mr M said thai, in the remarks which he proposed to sub
mit, whilst he should not hope or expect to say any thing new or
original on a subject which might properly be said to have been
exhausted by the reflection of the greatest men that this country
had ever produced he should erdeavor to avoid those old and
hackneyed ideas which had been so much the theme of discus
sion and ohsei vation
But, before he entered on the consideration of the main ques
Hon—the charter of a National Bank—he desired to say a word
or two in relation to an inciden al subject—the repeal of the
Sub Treasurj, and, as the fi st subject necessarily involved the
second, he should claim the privilege of saying something on
the la ter
In all the argumentswhich had been made in both Houses of
Coogtess duung the present session, not one word had been "aid
against the efficacy oi expediency of uV Sub Treasurv The
burden of the song of the enemies of that measure had bepn,
that it had recen ed the condemnation of the people, and that
therefore, it ought tobe repealed Now, whilst he admitted
thep ropnety and justness of the conclusion that if this mea^uie
had been condemned by the peoi le, it ought to be repealed he
hada woid to sayas to the /oei of the alleged condemnation
itself
In support of the po ition that the SubTieasury had been
condemned, gentlemen had i efeued with confidence to the last
election, as having settled that question beyond controversy
Was that the (act' J_et us examine and see whit the people
had sad in lelat an to the Sub Treasury Mr M then went in
to abnef history of the Sub Tieasuiy from its first reeom
mendation in ^37 through its original rejection by the peo
pie, to tlej uodwhei he contended it finally leceived their
express and inequívoca! sanction, as manifested m the compo
sition of the 26th Í ongiess At the late election, he contended,
anddunngth- routes n tone word had been said about the
Sub Tieisuryor tne cardu al principles involved in it— which
wasasep ration ofth Government from banks He admitted
thstswetpi g chaiges had been made against it, as uniting the
purse and the swoid—as providing specie for the office holders
and rags for the peof le, but the mam principle of the measure
had m no single instance been assailed during the last Pitei
dential canvass
The naked, caidinahprinciple involved in this Sub Treasury
system, that was to say, the separation of banks fiom the Go
veinment, had not he repeated been condemned by the pro
pie And, in tins connection he would refei t ti e autboi tv
ofa men wbes" opinion? 1 e Ww, wmld )e entitled ins tt
weight, heieand els whcie Mi M ben r a the lollow oi,
passage fiom the Iraug iral -ehhe sofG 1  Ham  in
 I know th i npon"nce which has been attached by men of
gieat abilities and patriotism to the divoice, as it is called of
the Treasury fiom thebankmg institutions It is not ihe di
\ orce which is complained of, but the unhallowed union of the
Treasuiy with the Executive Department, which has cieated
such exten n e alarm '
Mr M proceeded He had intended, he said, when the
question of thi lepeil of the Sub Treasury came up, if he had
thought there would have b en any prospect of success, to
move the íeleienceof the bill to the Committee on Finance
with a view of remedying these two featuies of the system
He had intended to move something 1 ke this that the com
mittee should bemsti acted to mquue into the expediency of
lepealins the specie clause of the Sub Tieasuiy bill and to
prnvideihat ihe receivers if pul he monevs (oi sub treasureis
asthey weie called)sHoil 1 be appointed in -orne o her «ay
than by the Executive There were vaiious ways m which
this latter oLject might be effected But the repeal had been
decreed, and it was not now wo-th while for him to throw any
obstacle mfhf way
The gentleman from Noi th Carolina, ["r «aunoers ] in
the course of the remarks submit ed by him yesterday had
shown, conclusl/ely, that that Sta e at least was opposed toa
National Bank No £en leman could deny ihe truth of that
propostion as to North Carolina anl what was tiue of that
State «as ti ue also of many othei states ol the Union, and par
ticularlyof theS'ate of Maryland How did she stand on this
question' He would a «ert bioadly, that on this question o
the Suh Treasury she was misrepresented tin this floor Io
sustain this position, Ml M tlunenteied at some length into
a hi tory of the tecent elections m Maryland, State and Te
deral                                                     „    ,                 ,             ,
He had desired to s ibmit some further remaiks on this
point but, as his time was «hoi t, he t ouldnow pa=s on to the
mine immediate question—the incorporation of a National
Bank
Hewoullnot detai i the committee m reflections upon the
power of Congress to c larter a Bmk as a national institution,
luuhei than to lefer to one or iw o objections urged! ere eeamst
the charter of a ha lonal Bank These had been geneially of
a negative character That inasmuch as no power of that de
scnption had teen given under the genei il powers chlegated
by the Com Itution t > Congic s, tha theietore it was no right
to cxeicise it This w?s a ne a.tlio aigument a=ainst a Bank
of the United Sates Bu' theie veie inferences to be diawn
fiom othei features of die Constilun n, wlnci ¡vould positively
prohibit the e abhshment of a National Bank and the most
linpouaut of tho e (eatui s ivas that which foibade theciea
tionof any monopcly in tni country That a Nitnnal Ban^
would be a mot opo > no i ¡an cm d den) A gent'eman luí

He would ask anv man to «ay \,he her it would  e possihle
to exclude the introduction of loieign capital un let thisclau^
The inducement would be too great Foreign capital!  s could
nut resin the tempwuon, and that which they weie prohibited
from doing directly they would contrive to do indirectly This
monopoly would be created for the benefit of foreigners, be-
cause, although they could not, under this clause oí the bill,
hold stock m then own names, y6t it would be easy for them to
have agents bete, and to own stock m American names And
this would be the case in spite of all the restrictions that could
be thiown around the bill He did not refer to this as any
particular objection, because he could not see why foreigneis
shoul 1 not hold stock, because the means would be afforded
thereby of the introduction of foreign capital He alluded to
it only for the purpose of shewing that, whilst the section had
been introduced with a view of fortifying the measure before
the people, under the idea that the bill exeluded foreigners fiom
the benefits of this Bank, yet that, indirectly, every inducement
was held out to foreigners to lake its stock
Again, as to the 21 st section By this section h was provided
that this Bank should be incorporated for the period of twenty
years and that, during that time, no Bank of a similar charac-
tershouldbemcorpoiated by ( ongrees He knew it had been
ate tedas the opinion of Mi Webster, one of the greatest con
stitutional lawyers of the country, that such a power existed in
Congress Buthe(MrM )demed emphatically and unequivocal-
ly that such a power did exist in the Constitution or m Con
giess, and, as authority for this denial, he gave the opinion ofa
man equd meveiy respect to Daniel Weoster, and that was
Chief Justice Taney If Congress had the power to do It, it
certainly had the power to do it to morrow, or at all times
Was ft in the power of one Congress to take fiom a Congress
which was to come hereafter any of itspoweisl The Consti-
tution of the United States regulated the powers of Congress,
but we it seemed, weie to go further than the Constitution, and
give to the Congress which incorporated this Bank the power
to Iimitand control the powers ofiuture Congresses
A word as w the sixteenth section Congress had either the
powei to incorporate a National Bank as such, or it had not
He knew there w re gentlemen who maintained lhat Congress
had not the power  incorporate a national institution as such,
but that it has the power to incorporate an institution within
the limits of theDistnct of Columbia under the powers given
to ( ongress to legislate within that D strict, and with a view to
accommodate the opinions of gentlemen on that point, an
amendment had been introduced i to the bill in the Senate, i n-
dei this general power of legislation, providing i hat the mother
Bank should ' e place i hole and that branches should be lntro
du ed into the S ates ty the cor eat of the States The princi-
ple-upon which the - Ue anl ¡satonal Covuninems rested
v, ete , lecis ly analogous Tneir powers might not indeed be.
tt e c n Out the pnncip es upon wbieb tlio&e poweis were
founded weie the same They were all derived fiom the peo-
ple Mr M then piuceedelto argue lhat the Constitution of
Maryland had, by no piovision, given express power to Ihe Les
"islatuie of that State to incorporate any Bank- that, according-
to the i rinciples of our Government, powers not expressly gi-
ven were denied, and that the State of Maiyland rot having:
possessed tlm power she could not delegate it to Congress as
legardedths District
But it had been said that the rower might be exercised hy
implication If that was «o, iheie was another provision
which piohibiied banks within the limits of Maiyland They
had i bill of i ight , which was a part of the fundamental law of
that State 1 he thirty ninth amele ofthat Bill tfRights de-
clared thatmonapnlies were odious-coitrary to the «pint of
free Government &c and ought not to be suffered There was
an express | inhibition on tleparttf the people of Maryland
that they should not giant a monopoly Now if a bank was
not a monopoly, what was lO
It miohtbeaigued that the exercise of this power by ihe Le-
gislature of Maryland lor yeais past would sanction the act
He knew that the aigument upon which he meant to rely
mioht lead to the exclusion of banks altogether—to their total
annihilation He believed that a strict adheience to the Consti
tulions of tho seveial States would load to that result But
the Legislature oi Maryland, and of other States,had exercised
this power, and thus, it might be seen, the act bad been sancti-
fied because although it was an encroachment on the r glits of
the people yet the people Ethemselves had permitted and suf-
fered it But Congress could asseit no such reasons lor the.
exeicise ol such an authoiuv Anl it the Legisla-ure of Ma-
ryland could not rglufully exercise such a power, how could
she delegate it to another! Ihe duties of Coigress,, with re
feienc to this Disuict were confined to matter  of legislation
exclusively within the Distiicl, and for the benefit and proter
tionofthe peopleof theD stuct Bejond that the Constitution
of the Un ted Stat* did not allow them to pass Did this
clause of the Constitution giving power to Congress tolegw
late exclusively for the District of Columbia, coniam, under-
that cloak the additional authority to exercise power overall
the ¡states'! Nevei—nevei Yet we were called upon to esta-
blish a bank undei that very clause No such power, he m
«is ed had been giv n
Theie was another clause m the Constitution of the United
States, a sue adheience to which would prohibit the lncoi
poi atlón ol this institution He alluded to that clause which
uro! íbited to the states the powerto emu billsof ciedit He
con d i iodt.ee authon íes to show that bank notes were inclu-
ded under thu clause and that it was for the veiy pui[ ose of
i lecludine the States from creatine numerous hanks that this
clause wis indued And if the Cons itution of the United
