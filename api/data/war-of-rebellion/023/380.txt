HUNTSVILLE, August 20, 1862.

Major SIDELL:

Do you hear that the garrison was captured? Have you any particulars of the affair?

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, August 20, 1862.

Major SIDELL:

What became of the garrison that was at Clarksville? How strong was it?

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

Major SIDELL, Nashville:

Send a train to Columbia to take Seventeenth Kentucky to Nashville and retain it there, and send one of the regiments now there to protect repairs on railroad. The road must be opened, and rapidly as possible. See Mr. Anderson about it, and push it through without further orders in case telegraph is cut between us. All the supplies, forage, beef cattle, &amp;c., which can be got about Nashville must be secured. With the Seventeenth Kentucky you will have eight regiments at Nashville, which will be enough to hold it and open the road to Kentucky. Send to Decherd and Murfreesborough all the supplies you can.

JAMES B. FRY.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

General SILL, Cowan:

Suspend your march for the present to give protection to the depot at Decherd until the garrison is well established. Give protection to foraging parties, and see that forage, beef, and flour are collected, and that not an ounce is wasted.

If you should be called forward to re-enforce General Schoepf move promptly. See that all public property, wagons, &c., are conveniently disposed of, so that they will be under the protection of the field work.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

General SILL, Decherd or Cowan:

A few rockets will be sent up at this place to-night between 8 and 9 o'clock to determine the distance at which they can be seen. Have some one on the lookout and report the result. If seen, report the colors and the exact order in which they occurred.

D. C. BUELL.

(Also commanding officers at Athens and Larkinsville, and Colonel Harker, Stevenson.)
