Brigadier General C. B. FISK:

SIR: I have the honor to report that Clay County is now free of bushwhackers. I have been as vigilant as circumstances would admit in driving them from this section of your district. On the night of the 9th instant forty-five crossed the Missouri River five miles below Richfield, Mo., going south. A portion of them consisted of some of the notorious bands which have infested this county for the last month, and the remainder were from Platte and Buchanan Counties. I was not advised of their movements in time to accomplish much. General, I am now satisfied that Clay County is now clear of guerrillas.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. McMICHAEL,

Captain, Commanding Station.
