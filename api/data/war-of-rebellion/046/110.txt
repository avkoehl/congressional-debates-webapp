[Indorsement No. 2.]

DECEMBER 8, 1863.

Respectfully submitted to the President for his information as to the condition of General Beauregard's command and his arrangements for defense.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

[Indorsement No. 3.]

It is not seen why the infantry force asked for by General Walker cannot be furnished by General Beauregard, arrangements being made to secure the return of the force at any time within a few hours to Charleston if events should require its presence at the latter place. The estimate of the number of troops requisite for the perfect defense of Charleston and its approaches against possible contingencies is no doubt correct; but our whole force does not permit the Government to keep at each assailable position as many troops as may become necessary. Immediate wants must decide the location of the forces we have.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
