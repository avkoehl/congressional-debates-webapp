uct worth £38,804,409; her home consumption
was £17,794,823; leaving for export value
£20,513,686, or $102,568,430.
In 1859 she manufactured 976,600,000 pounds
of the finished value of £71,373,214; her home
consumption was £23,164,770; leaving export
value, £48,208,444, or $241,042,220.
Mr. Bigelow, whose elaborate work on the
Tariff Question has furnished me with much
valuable information, estimates the remuner-
ative profit to English capital and labor in the
manufacture of the 976,600,000 pounds of cot-
ton in 1859 over the cost of material at nearly
two hundred million dollars.
It is not wonderful that British statesmen
should take pride in a manufacture which is
conceded to have added to the national wealth
within the last fifty years more than five thou-
sand million dollars.
I might ask here, why is it that we employ
to our own incalculable injury the labor of
other nations to produce the fabrics which we
wear from the material which we raise ?
But first let me allude in a few words to
other items of production. The number of
tons of pig iron produced in England and
Wales was, in—
1740   17,000,000
1778   68,000,000
1840 .1,39(5,000,000
18-16 .1,750,000,000
1864  4,767,951,000
% The estimated value of the iron of 1864 was
£11,919,877, equal to $55,599,385, and we ex-
ported of iron and its products from England
in 1864 $16,048,694. Great Britain produced
in that year one half of all the iron produced
in the world.
If we turn to coal, we find results equally
astonishing and suggestive. It was stated by
Mr. Taylor, in 1823, one of the most intelli-
gent and extensive proprietors of coal mines
in England, that the amount of coal consumed
in Great Britain was 15,800,000 tons. I find
by the examination of the Report of the Gov-
ernment Superintendent of Collieries for the
year 1865, that the production in that year was
92,787,873 tons, of which there were exported
7,529,341 tons, and there were consumed 85,-
258,532 tons. In 1860 the total coal mined in
the United States was 14,333,922 tons, and in
1863, under the extraordinary demand made
and anticipated by the Government, it did not
exceed 18,000,000 tons.
England has a population now nearly equal
to our own. By her system of labor and manu-
factures, protected against competition until
she could defy it, she has supplied the wants of
her own millions, and exported of her produc-
tions and manufactures to other countries in
a single year almost seven hundred million
dollars in value.
Sir, these exports have risen from the sum
of £37,234,396 in 1805 to £135,842,817 in
I860, and we have, except during the war of
1812, been her most mnnificent patron.
The statesmen of England know too well
the great sources of their national wealth to
imperil them by any policy of free trade, which
has in it more than the name.
England reared the throne of her empire
upon coal. She made iron king, and cotton
prime minister. She surrendered the sov-
ereignty of the colonies when she could retain
it no longer, but by her capital and our depend-
ence and folly secured the control of our pro-
ductions and our markets.
The victories won by England over Napoleon
were achieved in her mines, her workshops,
and her factories. The thunder-bolts which
fell at Talavera and Waterloo were forged in
the founderies of Britain. The glories of Tra-
falgar and the Nile would have been unreal-
ized in the absence of her manufactures, which
developing her resources at home and sustain-
ing her commerce on every sea, created the
wealth by which the arms of Spain and Prus-
sia and Russia were subsidized in that event-
ful conflict which convulsed Europe and the
world, and whose moving spirit was lulled to,
sleep by the surges of the South Atlantic.
Truly did Napoleon say, beneath the willows
of Longwood, "Great Britain conquered me
not with her swords but with her spindles; with
her spindles she subsidized all Europe, and
here 1 am." It will be well for us to remember
the power which subverted his empire.
Mr. Speaker, Monsieur Arago, on the 8th of
December, 1834, delivered before the Acad-
emy of Sciences, at Paris, an eloquent eulogium
upon James Watt; and in it he alludes to the
changes wrought by the steam-engine and jenny
in the manufacture of cotton. By their means,
in the county of Lancaster alone, he says :
"The spinners deliver to the calico manufacturers
a quantity of yarn that 21,000,000 clever spinners
could not accomplish with only the aid of the rock
and spindle; and 1,500,000 people now find occupa-
tion there, where, before the inventions ©f Arkwright
and Watt, there were only 50,000."
The cotton machinery of Lancaster in its full
working power is to-day performing the labor
of more than 50,000,000 men, while the labor
of the steam-engine, in its multifarious crea-
tions of power, rspresents the capacity of
600,000,000 people employed in manual labor.
The policy of England is to-day what the
policy of every wise nation is, to take care of
itself; and these elements of power, thus exist-
ing in profusion, are not to be sacrificed to any
sudden promptings of philanthropy. England
about 1826 inaugurated a modification of her
corn laws, not because she was unwilling to
protect her own producers, but because her
producers could not raise an amount approxi-
mating to the wants of a nation of manufac-
turers ; but in utter repudiation of every idea of
free trade, she made the import duty one pound
sterling per quarter of eight bushels, when the
market price was under fifty-one shillings, and
reduced it to one shilling when the price rose
to or above seventy-three shillings.
With the exception of the reduction of du-
ties on silks in 1824, and of corn a little later,
but little was done in England by way of redu-
cing duties for any purpose until the act of 1842,
in respect to which the Premier, Sir Robert
Peel, said:
" Wo have applied ourselves to imperfections in the
tariff, to make it clcar and intelligible, and, as far as
possible, consistent. We have sought to remove all
prohibitions, all absolute prohibitions upon the im-
portation of foreign artiel es; a nd we have endeavored
to reduce duties which are so high as to be prohibitory
to such a scale as may admit of a fair competition
with domestio producc.
" With respect to raw materials which constitute
the elements of our manufactures, our object, speak-
ing generally, has been to reduce them to almost a
nominal amount. In half manufaetared materials,
which enter almost as much as raw materials into our
domestic manulacture, we have reduccd the duty to
a nominal amount."
The various tariff acts from 1842 to 1859 re-
ducing the duties on raw material and articles
partially manufactured, as well as on articles
of food, were intended to increase the export
of her manufactures to other countries, where
England by reason of her immense capital and
machinery and her low labor could be a suc-
cessful competitor.
The reduction of duties on articles wholly
manufactured, ostentatiously alluded to by her
statesmen, was simply offering toother nations
a proposition they could not accept in'compe-
tition with anything manufactured in England,
for the simple reason that England could man-
ufacture cheaper than anybody else.
The mean annual customs collected in the
United Kingdom from 1838 to 1842 were re-
ported at $116,045,680, all of which, except
$10,542,715, were collected from silk manu-
factures, spirits, sugar and molasses, tea, tal-
low, timber, tobacco and snuff, wines, and
ordinary agricultural products.
In 1843 and 1844, that is, for the two years
after the free-trade tariff of 1842 reducing du-
ties, the mean annual customs amounted to
§116,638,720,^ of which all but $8,908,810
were of the list above enumerated.
Now, if we pass to the six years, from 1854
to 185',) inclusive, we shall find that the mean
annual revenue from cusloms was $117,797,085,
all of which save $2,779,885 was collected on
the enumerated list. Of the average annual
duties of the first period, $116,645,680, the sum
of $80,411,220 was collected from articles for
consumption not raised at all in Great Britain,
being on coffee, sugar, molasses, tea, timber,
tobacco, and wines. Of the $116,638,720 of
the second period, $86,531,410 were collected
on same items; and of the $117,797,085 of the
last period the sum of $92,584,301 was col-
lected from same sources. But we must deduct
from the residue in each instance $12,000,000
more for cusloms on imported spirits which
England does not manufacture to any extent
because of her limited production of grain com-
pared with her consumption. Where do we find
here the evidence that free trade has opened
the ports of England to foreign manufactures
which compete with her own ?
In 1841 and 1842, before her tariff proclaimed
the reduction of duties on imported articles
wholly or partially manufactured, she received
on finished articles but an annual revenue
of $2,397,850, and for the mean of 1843-44,
$2,377,625. Will these insignficent sums, not
more than sufficient to dover her revenue du-
ties on the finished non-competing manufac-
tures of the Indies and of other countries, indi-
cate that the world has free entry into the ports
of England?
In 1839 the import duties collected by Great
Britain amounted to $110,604,760. In 1859they
amounted to $123,522,635, which to Ameri-
can arithmetic would seem to prove that the
rule of reduction in England is that of 11 reduc-
tion ascending." Applied to the pretense of
"free trade," a logician might style it the
"reductio ad absurdum."
Preaching free trade to the world, England
has within the last ten years once, at least, if
not twice, imposed an increased duty of ten
per cent, upon American cottons imported into
her Indian empire to exclude the manufactures
of New England.
I feel reluctant to trespass longer on the
patience of the committee in proving, both by
the words and the acts of British statesmen, that
all their theories of free trade are based upon
the idea that their own manufactures are pro-
tected against our competition by their capital
and superior facilities, and that our markets
are to be opened to them by the alluring assu-
rance that their ports will be open to us. Yet
I may be pardoned for citing the language of
Sir Robert Peel in 1846, in debate in Par-
liament, complaining that other countries did
not comply with the disinterested desires of
England. He said:
"You have defied the regulations of those countries.
But your exports, whatever be the tariffs of other
countries, or however apparent the ingratitude with
which they havo treated you—your export trade has
boon constantly increasing. By the remission of your
duties upon the raw material, bv increasingyonrskill
and industry, by competition with foreign goods, you
have defied your competitors in foreign markets,
and you have even been able to exclude them. Not-
withstanding their hostile tariffs the declared value
of British exports has increased above ten million
pounds during the period which elapsed since the re-
laxation of duties on your part. I say. therefore, to
you that these hostile taritfs, so far from being an
objection to continuing your policy, are an argument
in its favor. But depend upon it your example will
ultimately prevail."
Suppose wo had adopted this policy and
opened our ports for the right of entry to those
of Great Britain, where would have been the
benefit to us? England years aso attempted
to secure the reduction of our tariff by promis-
ing the repeal of her corn laws, and held out
her proposed action as an equivalent for what
she asked of us.
The proposition was not accepted, and in
1849 she removed the duties upon grains of her
own volition and for her own interest. In 1850
we exported nearly three million bushels of
grain less than in 1849, and nearly a million less
than in 1848.
The following table will show our exports
from 1840 to 1800, and from the fluctuations
