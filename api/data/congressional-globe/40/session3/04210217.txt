possible point, and by the honest collection of
the revenues.
It is for Congress to keep down the expendi-
tures, and it is for the President to see that the
laws are faithfully executed and that the reve-
nues are collected; but it is for Congress to
see also that they do not keep the fetters upon
the limbs of the President so as to render it
impossible ror him to faithfully execute the
latts.
It is 'well to recur to the total expenditures
of the Government for the last three years, and
it is encouraging to observe that they have been
gradually decreased :
In 1865-66 they were $520,000,000
In 1866-67 they were  316,000,000
In 1867-68 they were    333,000,000
In 1867-68 they were, exclusive of bounties 334,000,000
In 1867-GS, or inclusive of bounties ($43,-
T 000,000)  377,000,000
In 1868-60 they are estimated, exclusive of
bounties, at  310,000,000
In 1868-69, or inclusive of bounties ($26,-
000,000)  336,000,000
For the next fiscal year, 1869-70, these are
estimated at  303,000,000
and this latter estimate the committee believe
will be materially reduced.
The amount for bounties is not properly
chargeable to the expenditures of the Govern-
ment; and it is a matter of congratulation that
there are no bounties estimated for the coining
fiscal year 1869-70.
The amount voted for deficiencies for the year
1867-68 was $15,000,000, and that amount is
included in the total of expenditures for that
fiscal year.
The amount called for as deficiencies for the
present fiscal year, and which is included in
the total of expeuuitures as given above, is
$21,000,000.
It is worthy of note that on the 2d day of
December, 1807, the Secretary of the Treas-
ury estimated the appropriations required—
For the fiscal year ending June 30,1869...$372,000,000
On the6th of December, 1868, he states that
the expenditures for the first quarter of
the same fiscal year were $105,000,000
He estimates for the noxt
three quarters an expendi-
ture ol  231,000,000
Total, including interest and defi-
ciencies   336,000,000
Expenditure less than estimated by
the Secretary of.  S36.000.000
DEFICIENCIES.
And I now proceed to the consideration of
the interesting question of what this Congress
will be called upon to appropriate for deficien-
cies for the preseut fiscal year ending June 30,
18G9, and to carry on the Government for the
next fiscal year ending June 30, 1870.
First, as to the estimates made by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury "of additional appropria-
tions required to complete the service of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, and previous
years." It is for Congress to inquire rigidly into
the necessity and propriety of voting these de"
ciencies, which the Secretary estimates aj^ie
enormous sum of $21,000,000. Of t&s amount
$14,000,000 is for the Army, necessitated,
in a great measure, by a consuming Indian
war, which is entailing extraordinary expenses
on the Government. The next current amount
is the estimated deficiency for the Post Office
Department of over four and a half million
dollars, incurred by extravagant contracts for
unjustifiably extended mail service.
Then there is the scandalous estimate of
nearly §56-5,000 for deficiencies for public build-
ings where we were promised that the large
amounts we appropriated last year should finish
the buildings. Add this amount of $665,000
demanded as a deficiency for this fiscal year to
the amount demanded for the same purpose
for the noxt fiscal year of $2,434,000. makes
§3,099,000 which we are asked to vote for pub-
lic buildings at this session of Congress. And
in the present state of the Treasury, or, indeed,
in any state of the Treasury, I feel bound to
denounce it as one of the most extravagant,
unjustifiable, and profligate expenditures of the
public money ever asked of Congress. There
are other deficiencies which have been made,
and which we are called upon to make up, that
are without justification if it be considered
that Congress has any power over the public
Treasury. In view of the state of our finances,
and deetning it indispensably necessary to re-
duce our expenditures for the present year in
every way possible, and in full light of all tlie
facts, Congress appropriated a given amount—
which was $450,000— fof the Coast Survey for
this year.
In contempt of the action of Congress a de-
ficiency in that appropriation of $160,000 is
now demanded, not one dollar of which, I
trust, will be voted. The Columbian Institute
for the Deaf and Dumb, a private institution
in this District, which has obtained nearly half
a million dollars out of the Government, was
given $12,500 for this fiscal year for instruc-
tion, &c., which was deemed ample and even
generous; but with a familiarity of the whole
action of Congress on this subject, the president
of this private corporation, with unparalleled
effrontery, arraigns Congress for its action and
demands of us $17,500 more as a deficiency
for this year I
There are other deficiencies estimated for
which will be scrutinized by the Appropriation
Committee before it reports any bill. But one
thing is clear, if Congress cannot control the
expenditures of the Government, if it cannot
curb the executive officers of the Government
in spending the public money, and if such offi-
cers are to be left practically to determine the
appropriations, then, I say, let Congress abdi-
cate, and let the people be saved the expense
of keeping up this expensive and somewhat
ornamental institution.
AFl'KOPRIATIOXS FOK TIII5 FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNK
30,1870.
The Secretary of the Treasury estimates the
following appropriations as necessary for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1870:
For civil service, including tlie expenses of foreign
intercourse, internal revenue, courts, loans, public
domain, deficiency in the revenues of tho Post
Office Department, and all other expenditures ex-
cept for pensions, Indian, and the War and Navy
Departments  $45,140,825 60
For pensions  23,250,000 00
For Indian department  2,040,382 70
For Army proper ;.... 52,184,781 97
For Military Academy  3i4,388 88
For armory and fortifications  4,681,200 00
For harbor and river improvements,
public buildings, &c  8,486,018 00
For naval establishment  20.903,414 5!)
$158 014,011 74
To the estimates are added statements show-
ing, first, the appropriations estimated for the
service of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1870,
made by former acts of Congress, of a specific
and indefinite character, as follows:
For miscellaneous objects, including the ex-
penses of collecting tho revenue fiom cus-
toms    $0,749,000 00
For compensation to the Post Office
Department for mail services  700,000 00
For civilization of Indians... :  10,000 00
For arming and equipping the; militia, 200,000 00
l?or intorcston the public debt  128,690,676 00
$139,319,676 00
2. The estimated balances of existing ap-
propriations which will be unexpended on
June 30, 1869, part, of which are required for
the payment of the liabilities of the present
fiscal year, but which will not be drawn from
the Treasury until after June 30, 1869, are as
follows:
For the civil service, &c  ^
For pensions and Indians  24,558,831 49
For War Department  20,90 >,291 44
For Navy Department   12,9o±,043 /6
68,322,803 37
It is estimated tbat of this sum there
will not be required for tho service of ,
the fiscal year ending June 30,18i0 62,b80,4.Jl 11
$o,636,312_26
Total estimated expenditures for tho
year ending June 30, 18(0 $303,000,000 00
It .will be-thus aeeh .that* $803,000,000 is the
amount asked for, and it.is for Congress to
determine how much of that sum it is abso-
lutely necessary to appropriate to carry on the
Government. How much witiit bet I will let the
permanent appropriations stand as in the Sec-
retary's estimate, though I believe the amount
of interest on the public debt is overstated
$2,000,000. That amount is $128,690,676,
which we must regard as fixed arid definite.
Then there is the other amount of $158,014,-
011 74, made up of the items as set out in the
estimate. The question recurs how rauch can
this amount be reduced without detriment to
the public service? It is now impossible for
me to state how much the first item for
$45,000,000 can be reduced, as the Appropria-
tion Committee has not yet proceeded far
enough in the consideration of the various
amounts making up the sum.
But we shall report a reduction of more than
$100,000 from what was asked for the expenses
of foreign intercourse, and nearly $1,000,000
from what is asked to go inlo the legislative,
executive, and judicial bill. Pensions, Indian
department, and Army proper must remain
about the same as stated in the estimates. Mil-
itary Academy we reduce nearly $50,000 on
the estimates. Por armory and fortifications
§4,681,200 are asked, and I believe we can get
along with $1,500,000. Por harbor and river
improvements and pnblicbuilJings $8,486,018.
In my judgment $3,000,000 will be as much as
Congress would wish to appropriate under both
of those heads. For the naval establishment
$20,993,414 59 are estimated. Bntin the Navy
bill already prepared this is reduced to about
$16,000,000, which, it is believed, will answer
every purpose.
Hero are some $15,000,000 which it is
thought can be cut off from the estimates of
the total expenditures for the year ending
June 30, 1370, of $303,000,000, as submitted
by the Secretary of the Treasury. That will
leave lor the total expenditures for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1870, $288,000,000. Add
to that $2,000,000 more for various other ex-
penditures, and we have a total of $290,000,000.
it is my belief that the expenditures can be
kept down to that point, and that the Govern-
ment can be administered for that sum, and
if that can be done, as it ought to be done, a
good showing can be made.
1 have made no estimate in relation to the
revenue for the next fiscal year, but for the
present fiscal year it appears from the Secre-
tary's report that the actual revenues re-
ceived for the first quarter amount to $95,-
0(10,392, and that the Secretary estimates the
next three quarters at $246,000,000, making
tho total estimate of the Secretary $341,000,-
000. J3ut Mr. Wells, Special Commissioner of
the Revenue, who has given this matter .great
attention, estimates that it will reach $356,-
000,000, being $15,000,000 more than the
estimate of the Secretary.
Assuming, theretore, that we shall not col-
lect more revenue for the fiscal year ending
June 30,1870, than the Secretary estimates we
shall collect for the present fiscal year, and
assuming that our expenditures will not ex-
ceed $290,000,000 there will be a surplus of
$51,000,000 forthe year ending June 80,1870.
But with an honest collection of the revenue,
and without any increase of taxes, I think we
can collect $450,000,000 of revenue. If this
can be done and our expenditures can be kept
even within $300,000,000 we will show ajsnr-
plns at the end of the fiscal year 1870 of
$150,000,000.
With an exhibit of this character, which is
an exhibit that can be made if Congress and
the Executive shall act in harmony to that
great end, the credit of the Government will
be established on an enduring basis, our bonds
will go to par in Europe, greenbacks will ap-
proximate gold in value; taxes may then be
reduced, and the country will enter on a career
of prosperity, glory, and power without par-
allel iu the history of nations.
