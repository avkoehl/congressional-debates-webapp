Lookout does to Chattanooga, and too much honor cannot be given to the gallant men who carried its crest to-day, among whom I should not neglect to mention Captain G. R. King, Lieutenant Vaughan, and Lieutenant Munday. About 9 a. m. I saw a thick could of dust rising in the southwest, and soon another rebel column was displayed on that side of the place and commenced a vigorous attack, but a fe well-directed shells caused them to fall back. The firing ceased about 12.30 p. m., the enemy retired. I am informed that a portion of Gano's command is to attack me in the morning with four pieces of artillery. It is also reported that a part of Magruder's infantry is crossing the Arkansas River. Should I find these reports to be true I will inform you at once. This position is a favorable one; has no wealth to tempt the enemy. Merchandise, subsistence, and quartermaster's stores mostly expended, and as they could not expect to hold it long, would not pay a great sacrifice in taking it. With a re-enforcement of 1,500 men and a battery we could hold out against Price's whole army. I shall rely on you for daily information of movements north of me.
