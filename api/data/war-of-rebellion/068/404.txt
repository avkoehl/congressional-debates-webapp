Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A Mr. Wyckoff, a Northern miner, whom I have met and believe to be reliable, has sent me word that a person from Orange Court-House yesterday told him that Breckinridge and Polk had joined Lee. I send you this for what it is worth. Warren is making his disposition to attack, and Sedgwick to support him. Nothing immediate from the front. I think, still, Lee is simply making a demonstration to gain time. I shall, if such is the case, punish him. If he is disposed to fight this side of Mine Run at once, he shall be accommodated.

I ordered General Ricketts to hold the roads leading from the enemy's line to our right flank. I am informed you have ordered him forward as one of Burnside's division has arrived. I would suggest Burnside's division relieving Ricketts' on the roads, also a small party of cavalry I have in front of Ricketts. Ricketts having received my order after yours is awaiting your action on this suggestion.

I have also just heard from Sedgwick, who reports Wright's right having been vigorously attacked at 8 p.m. The attack handsomely repulsed.

Yours,

GEO. G. MEADE.
