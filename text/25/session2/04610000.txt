rest, accompanied by a report, which was ordered
to be printed The bill was read, and ordered to a
second reading.
Mr R from the same committee, asked to
be discharged from the further consideration of the
petition of the mother of Andrew Watts, which was
concurred m
Mr GRUNDY said that the bill for the relief of
J P Converse and Henry J Rees, had been re-
jected yesterday, and as he had voted for the rejec-
tion, he should now move to reconsider that vote
He was always disposed to do strict justice to the
application of claimants From a conversation he
had held with the head of the Post Office Depart-
ment since the rejection of the bill, he had denved
certain information which he was not befoie pos-
sessed of in relation to that claim, and though ho
did not agree that the bill should be passed in its
present shape, yet, if the Senate would indulge him
in his wish to reconsider the vote, he would then
move to recommit the bill to the committee that re-
ported it, m ordei that the committee might have
the benefit of the information he had derived, and
do what was right and just between the Govern-
ment and claimants
Mr. MERRICK, who reported the bill, expressed
a wish that the Senator might be gratified He be
lieved the claim to be essentially a just one, and
had advocated it with some zeal, on account oí the
opinion he entertained ol its. merits
The vole was taken on reconsideration, and
earned in the affirmative, and the bill, on motion oí
Mr. GRUNDY, was recommitted to the Committee
on Claims
Mr. LYON offered the following resolution
Resolved, That the Secretary of War be duectcd
to communicate to the Senate a copy of such letters
from Generals Scott and Brady and Major Gar-
land, of the United States army, and a copy oí
such other evidence in possession of Ins Depart-
mentasmay tend to venfyorrofute certain charges
against the Government of the United States, or
the State of Michigan, made either direct oi im-
pliedly by Lieutenant Colonel Maitland, of the
military forces oí Uppei Canada, in hi-, published
official report of the U5th oí Februiiy list, icla
live to the dispersion of the ioiccs assembled on
Fighting island, in the Detroit nvei
Mr L said he had not seen (he official report of
Colonel Maitland, to which thisusolntion referred,
but h« believed he had given its date and descrip-
tion with sufficient accuracy to identify it
He understood that it had been extensively pub-
lished in both the Cañadas and m England, and
that it contained statements bearing against the
Government of the United Stales, or, at least,
against the official authorities acting in Michigan,
which were incorrect and untrue, and were entirely
disproved and refuted by the correspondence and
evidence called for in the resolution
It was due to ihe gallant officers of the aimy,
and to the Brady Guards, and other patriotic
volunteers who sustained them on the Delioit fron-
tier, and it was no less due to the characlei of the
Government itself, that this refutation should be
published as widely, if possible, as the original
charges had been
He would not leave the British Government,
nor would he leave the Government oi people of
Canada, any excuse or justification whatever foi
such an act of piracy and murder as had been
committed, under the sanction of some of the offi-
cial authorities oí that Government, in the destruc
tioa of the Caroline' He did not know that this
atrocious act was approved by the British authori-
ties at home, but he saw with great pam and regret
that it seemed to be appioved by the authorities of
Canada If he was not misinformed, the officer
under whose direction the outrage was committed
had been promoted, or honored in some other way
fer his services, and such was the public sentiment
at Toronto, if we can believe the newspapers, that
onsomepubhcoccasiontherelately,Capt Marryatt,
an officer of the British navy, and a writer of some
distinction, gave as a toast " Captain Drew and h%$
irave companions who cut out the steamboat Cat oliw'"
He believed this statement might be relied on as
correct, for on account of it the Captain had since
that time been burnt in effigy in the city of Detroit,
and all his writings with him, in front of the house
where he was then staying, and it was not known
that he had ever disavowed the sentiment
Now, sir, said Mr. L if such outrages are to
pass not only without censure, but with positive
and unqualified approbation, as in this instance, it
is time for both this Government and the Govern-
ment of Great Britain to look well to the conse-
quences that may follow.
What do we see already? The newspapers of
yesterday inform us that the British steamer Sir
Robert Peel has been boarded, s«t fire to, and de-
stroyed, by a body of armed men proceeding from
our shores, while the boat was lying peaceably and
quietly at anchor in eur waters, on the river St.
Lawrence1 Is it not highly probable lhat this act
has been committed in retaliation for the destruc
lion of the Caroline, and on account of the appro-
val of that act by the Canadian authorities? And
if such be the fact, sir, would it not be as reasona-
ble in us to approve this outrage as it was in them
to appiovc that? But who is there in this nation,
what public man or what private citizen is there,
who will sanction the aggression? Not one, sir,
none but íecklcss, lawless desperadoes, who, hav-
ing neither character nor any thing else to lose
themselves, would gladly plunge the nation into
wai, in the hope that something may turn up to
their personal advantage
I trust, sir, the offenders will be brought to jus-
tice, that they will be visited with the utmost rigor
ot the law, and that we shall set an example to our
Canadian neighbors which it will be their interest,
as well as their duty, to follow, for they may rest
assured, that should a war once be kindled between
the two countries, the result would be as little to
their advantage as to our own, and it would un
questionably be one oí the gieatest and most deplo-
rable calamities thai could befall either
Mr PRLSTON asked if the consideration of lhc
resolution was sought for now? He did not know
that he should be opposed to the measure-, but it
sliuck him as somewhat peculiar ts> ask lor infor-
mation in i elation to so delicate a matter, from su
bordmate oihe rs
Mi LYON said he felt no disposition to press it
The resolution might lie over m accordance with
the ni les of the Senate
Mr  WEBSTER then submitted the following
Revolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
communicate to the Senate a copy of any order or
circular issued by him to the collectors and recei-
vers oi public money wn« the passage of the joint
resolution of Ihe 1st of June, 1838, relating to the

Mr BENTON said that a communication which
had been received from the Tieasury Department
in relation to the exchanges, &c had been ordered
to be printed, and the usual number had been struck
off, but, as it was a document of some importance,
going back as far as '83, several of his friends had
suggested that an extra number had better be order-
ed, and, in accordance with lhat wish, so gcneiallij
expressed, he would move mat 3,000 copies be

and sent to the House, where again it had been so-
amended as to strike out all alter the eaactmg
