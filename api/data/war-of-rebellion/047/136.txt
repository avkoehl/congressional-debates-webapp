by the signal corps, since it was almost entirely by this system that prompt connection was had by headquarters with the contiguous military and naval stations along the coast.

The general efficiency of the corps was always admirable, and there were very few circumstances (and those due to exceptional conditions of the atmosphere) under which the intent of the system could not be fully carried out.

In this department such a system is strictly indispensable, and the long distances that separate its posts are rapidly and successfully annihilated. The facility with which essential information is conveyed on the field of battle is one of the most valuable points to be considered, and few, if any, commanders can now afford to dispense with such assistance.

Briefly, I cannot conceive how large operations can be conducted without the signal corps. It has become inseparably a part of every superior command.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. SEYMOUR,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
