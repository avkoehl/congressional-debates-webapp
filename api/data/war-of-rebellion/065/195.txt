FORT SUMTER, March 6, 1864.

SIR: Owing to the haziness of the atmosphere no observation can be taken of the fleet. The Brooke gun and a 10-inch are lying on the berm of the sea face. Seven shots were yesterday fired at the fort, all of which struck; 1 shell wounded 2 men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. H. WILDS,

Captain, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, March 9, 1864.

I have the honor to report that there are 5 monitors inside this morning; in other respects the fleet is about the same, except that only one blockader is visible, which may be owing to their remoteness and the thickness of the weather. The shells fired last night, 8 of which exploded over the fort, 1 struck the slope, and 1 passed over. Gregg opened on Simkins this morning, who replied, together with Sullivan's Island.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
