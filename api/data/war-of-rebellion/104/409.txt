Railroad effectually cut at Griffin and this point this p. m. by detachments. Public property destroyed at both points; also at Zebulon. Please send orders, also information of general commanding First Division, so that a junction may be formed.

Gardner's Factory, Ga., April 19, 1865.

The attention of all commanding officers in the command is called to the fact that small squads of negroes are straggling through the country foraging. This must be stopped at once. Negroes will not be allowed to leave the column under any circumstances, but if it is necessary to send out parties for forage a company or more can be sent, always under an officer. Attention is called to Special Field Orders, Numbers 20, of April 11, 1865, from cavalry headquarters, in reference to foraging, which seems to be disregarded by the troops of this division. There can be no excuse for this, and will be corrected at once. Brigade commanders will report in writing to-day whether Special Orders, Numbers 20, has been published to the men of the division as directed.

By order of Colonel R. H. G. Minty:
