Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from Finegan's brigade, who left his picket-line last night, reports no changes within the enemy's lines. He has heard nothing indicating the recent arrival or departure of troops.

J. McENTEE,

Captain.

P. S.-There are 110 regiments, or twenty-two brigades, in our front (south of Appomattox River). By general comparison of deserters statements, I judge that these regiments do not average 200 men each.

Respectfully,

J. McE.
