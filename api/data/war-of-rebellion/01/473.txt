Richmond, August 19, 1861.

Colonel W. S. DILWORTH,

Fernandina, Fla.:

SIR: The attention of this Department has been already directed to the importance of the defense of the harbor of Fernandina, and in reply to your letter of the 12th instant I have the honor to inform you that artillery such as you desire has been already directed to be forwarded to you, in compliance with previous requisitions addressed to this Department, and it is hoped it may arrive in time to meet your most pressing exigencies.

In reply to your further propositions I have the honor to say that an artillery company, if organized and furnished with a battery, will be accepted, and assigned to your command if its services are desired by you; and that a cavalry company also, armed and furnishing its own horses, will be accepted, if required, and assigned to your command.

Respectfully,

L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War.

Honorable JOHN MILTON,

Marianna, Fla.:

SIR: I have had the honor to receive your communication of the 16th August, covering a letter from Lieutenant J. A. Alexander, relating to the defenses of Apalachicola, and it gives me pleasure to inform you that Brigadier-General Grayson, of the Confederate Army, has been assigned to the military command of Florida, and will report in full to this Department the necessities of that State. In the meanwhile the enemy will, doubtless, find employment elsewhere.

I have the honor to be, with high consideration,

L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War.
