On motion of Mr. CLAY, the Senate took up
the joint resolutions submitted by him, to amend

nig particulars, v z
1st To restrict the veto poWt,r 21 To lake from the hxc
cuuve the power to appoint the Secret lyofthe lretsury and
the Treasurei, and vest it exclusively n he t\TO Houses of
Congress 3d To prevent the appointment of membpis of
Congress to civil office, under the auchouty of the United states
from and during the time for wh cli they are elec ed
Mr. MOREHEAD asked  the indulgence of the
Senate while he submitted a few ob ervat'ons on
the resolutions submitted by  his> distinguished col
league some time ago, and now called ipV further
consideration.    He had li ten J ¿< evively to the
comments of the Senator on his righ' [Mr Pies
ton,] and of the Senator on Ins ls't, [Mu.  Bucha-
nan,] when the subject was under discus  Oj on
two previous occasion ;, and while he ac ^o ltog d
the ability and eloquence wi'h t hich both opp scd
the resolution , he was forced to say lhat ¡hry hid
failed to convince him that they were right    tie
regretted that the very eloquent speech  o! hr cut.
tinguished friend from S uih Caro ina [Mr Prtrs
ton] had not been repor ed, but tne veiy ekquen'
remarks of the Senator f'om Prnns< Ivan'a, which
he had fad attentively in ptint,cove'ed, he beh-ved,
the whole ground  taken   by   Lo h Scnaioib, ani
in replying to it, he conccveíl he would b* repi m^
to the arguments of hi' friend fiom South Carrlma,
as well as to those ot the Senator from Pennsji.d-
ma.
He found in the renorted speech of the latter
that the three main grounds of opnos.tion to the re
solutions were: First, because the veto power IS a
purely Democratic po  r, .ad ougV not tobe
touchsd on that account, secondly, because it is
nothing more than an appeal to the peop e oeea
sioning no further inconvenience than a shoit delay
in the passage of the law, if the law should prove
to have the assent of the people; and thirdly, be-
cause it can effect much good by arresting rash,
hpsty, immature, and improper legislation, while
it cannot be dangerous, inasmuch as ihe people
will ultimately decide and cent ol ihe action oj the
Execu ive.
To t'use three points, the principal part of Mr
Morehead's argum°n s was di ec ed. Ha refer-
red 10 the republics of antiqui y, and to ¡he History
of modern Governments, to show tl at the velo
pokier was noi purely Democratic, and tsiai i s ef-
fect, however its object might hav  been m ended,
was conserva ive of executive power in Hatt a
to ü e second position, lhat it was only an appe ! to
the peonle, he argued thst the possesion ot potver
by the Esec i ive with all the emoluments and pa
tronage oí ofice at his disposal, drew ainund him
an artife al supfort which counteracted the popu-
lar will, and that, therefore, the real voice of the
majority of the people agams' the exerci e of the
po ver could not be obtained, and if it could, would
be lost in the shadow of personal populan!/, as in
the instance of General Jackson.
Witn regard to the third position, that it rnigiit
effect much gcod, and coald nit be dangerou , he
argued the conveise from t^e experience of every
Republic in winch the ve'o porer hid exis ed To
it he aU'ibuted ¡ne downf<ti of all tne Republics of
the arcient a'ii inodern world. He argued ihu
fcebl" an ' harm tos as it s^eme^, 11 its infancy, i i
tendency was o increase in s'reigth with years, tul
fina'ly U overtirsw all restraints, and utarp^d a'l
o'her powers
