HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 24, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, via Lexington, Mo.:

There are about 4,000 Enrolled Missouri Militia in camp and nominal service in my district along the two lines of railroad. I say about, because it is impossible to get returns from all of them. One-fourth of them would be of more service than all are, so far as the maintenance of these lines of road and the wants of my district are concerned. If there is no reason to expect the return this way of any considerable part of Price's command I hope the general commanding will give me authority to relieve from duty all I do not need. The Iron Mountain line is complete to South Big River bridge, fifteen miles this side of Pilot Knob. It will take five or six days to complete that. I have the fort well garrisoned, the guns being remounted and a good supply of artillery ammunition on hand.
