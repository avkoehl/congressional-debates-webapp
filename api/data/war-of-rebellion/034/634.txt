start of our people, and before they could be concentrated to follow him the roads and streams became almost impassable, in consequence of heavy rain. In the mean time he reached Columbia, from which point the roads are good. He was checked at the crossing of Green River by five companies of the Twenty-fifth Michigan, leaving some 30 killed and as many wounded. Among the killed was Colonel [D. W.] Chenault. He made adetour and reached Lebanon, capturing the garrison of 350 men before re-enforcements could be got up, and then moved on the Spring-field, where his force separated. The main body moved in the direction of Bardstown, on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. One brigade moved back toward Columbia, and small parties moved in the direction of Frankfort and Lexington. Our mounted force is nearly all occupied in trying to cut him off. As soon as he is disposed of, I will start the expedition. It would not do to move our mounted force into East Tennessee, and leave him in Kentucky to break up our railroad communications and capture our wagon trains. Thus far he has done but little harm, but I fear he will destroy some of the bridges.

All my cavalry is after Morgan. I have one brigade of infantry and some artillery on boats to prevent his crossing, and if he does not go too high up for our boats to go, we can probably prevent his crossing. This morning he was at Jackson, with Hobson following him closely. I succeeded last night in getting a militia force in his front at Berlin, within 6 miles of Jackson, and a cavalry force, under Judah, between him and Gallipolis. Gunboats have arrived at Gallipolis. I am organizing troops in Kentucky for a move into East Tennessee as soon as this raid is over. When will the draft be made here? Please answer in cipher.

I telegraphed you on the 17th that our forces were closing around Morgan, with a fair prospect of finally capturing or destroying the entire force. During the last three days he has been trying to cross the river between Marietta and Portsmouth; but our forces have been harassing him, and up to the last advices we have captured more than half of his force, all of his artillery, destroyed all his wagon trains, and killed some 200. Among the prisoners are Basil [W.] Duke, Colonel Dick [R. C.] Morgan (brother of the general), and some 48 commissioned officers. His command is completely broken up and scattered, and constantly surrendering is small bodies. Not over 20 or 30 have succeeded in crossing the river thus far. We hope to capture the whole remaining force within the next twenty-four hours.
