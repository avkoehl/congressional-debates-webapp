THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 7,
Mr. ANTHONY. A.t the close of scction
four I move to insert:
And any State having .1 fraction exceeding one
half of the number required for a Representative
shall have one Representative added to its represent-
ation.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. It is obvious,
I think, that Rhode Island will have a large
fraction, about one half.
Mr. POMEROY, Will this add to the three
hundred?
Mr. ANTHONY. Yes.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. It will be
seen by Senators that in such a ease as that,
while ninety per cent, of Pennsylvania, Ohio,
or New York might be represented,-not more
than sixty or seventy per cent, of the people
of Rhode Island would be represented. Under
such circumstances it seems to me it would be
fair, if there was more than one half the num-
ber required for a Representative, to give an
additional member.
Mr. HARLAN. I have 110 objection to that
amendment. The fractions under one half
probably would balance those over one half,
so as to leave the number about the same.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the amendmeut of the Senator from Rhode
Island.
The amendment was agreed to.
The amendments were ordered to be en-
grossed and the bill to be read a third time.
The bill was read the third time, and passed.
On motion of Mr. TRUMBCJLL, tlie tide
was an^fcded so as to read: "A bill to fix the
time forthe election and provide for the ap-
portionment of Representatives and Delegates
in Congress."
executive blSs&iox.
Mr. CONKLINGr. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive lousi-
ness.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
proceeded to the consideration of executive
business. At half past four o'clock the doors
were reopened, and the Senate took a recess
until half past seven o'clock p. ni.
EVENING SESSION.
The Senate reassembled at half past seven
o'clock p. m.
M'OUEOOR AND MISSOURI IUVU1! KAIMVAY.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The special order
for this evening is the conference report 011 the
Army bill, upon which the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts [Mr. Wilson] is entitled to the
floor.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I understand the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts is willing to yield to
me to call up a bill.
Mr. WILSON. I am willing to give way for
ten minutes for action on brief bills that will
not take any time.
Mr. HARLAN. I have a bill that will lead
to 110 debate, and I hope the Senator will allow
me to call it up.
Mr. COLE. If the Senator from Massachu-
setts yields to anybodj'I think he ought to yield
to me.
Mr. WILSON. I cannot yield to anything,
unless it is a very small matter which will lead
to no debate. 1 am willing to have such bills
considered for a few moments until a quorum
is here.
Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask the'Senator from
Massachusetts to yield to me for one moment
to call up a little bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Several Senators
are appealing to the Senator from Massachu-
setts. Does he yield ; and if so, to whom?
Mr. WILSON. I yield to the Senator from
Iowa, [Mr. Harlan.]
Mr. HARLAN. 1 move to take up Senate
bill No. 477.
Mr. WILSON. If it does not take anytime
I uo not object to thai, bill being called up.
By unanimous consent, the !3e:iu.ie. :>•< in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (S. No. 477) to amend an act
entitled "An act for a grant of lands to the
State of Iowa, in alternate sections, to aid in
the construction of a railroad in said State,"
approved May 12, 1864, and to grant lands
to aid in the construction of a raiiroad from
O'Brien county, Iowa, to the Missouri river.
Mr. HARLAN. I will not ask to have the
original bill read, but I offer an amendment as
a substitute for the bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The substitute
will be reported in lieu of the original bill.
Mr. HARLAN. It has been examined very
carefully by the honorable chairman of the
Committee on Public Lands and myself, and
I think is free from objection.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I should like to inquire of
my friend from Iowa which it is that gives the
least land, the original bill or the substitute?
I want the one read that gives the least.
Mr. HARLAN. I do not know about .that.
This does not give any more than it ought to.
Mr. POMEROY. The substitute gives the
least.
Mr. HOWELL. There are some limitations
in the substitute that are not in the original
bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Then let that be road.
The VICE PRESIDENT. -The Secretary
will read the proposed substitute.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment, as
follows :

thereupon said Lands, except so far as they snail have

railroad, shall revert to the United States.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. There is one
point in that bill which I think should be rem-
edied, and that is,-allowing the company to
make up deficiencies. It seems to me that
that is at war with the principle of raising the
price of the remaining lands where a railroad
may be chartered.
Mr. HARLAN. That is in every other rail-
road grant except the grant made to the Union
Pacific. Still, 1 shall not insist upon it indi-
vidually. The Senator refers to the provision
that there shall be a margin of twenty-five miles
within which to make up deficiencies.
Mr. RAMSEY. That is the universal pro-
vision in all these grants.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. To go out of
the usual line to make up deficiencies 
Mr. HOWELL. Without discussing it, let
us take the sense of the Senate upon it. I am
willing to abide by whatever the Senate decides.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Vermont moves to strike out the proviso on the
third page, which allows the company to go
outside of the line for twenty-five miles to make
up deficiencies.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Mr. Presi-
dent, it niqy be necessary in some instances,
