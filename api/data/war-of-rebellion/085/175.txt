You will issue orders directing the troops of the Third Division to move up the river to Cape Girardeau and disembark and go into camp at that point. Take with you ten days' rations and forage. Order the discharge of all of the steamers, except two of the smallest and best boats. Select your camp in reference to defense. I will join you at Cape Girardeau.
