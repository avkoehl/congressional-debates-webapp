General Hoke passed up road on north side of turnpike toward Dr. Howlett's with one brigade, possibly the same that was reported by pickets last evening.

By order of General Butler.

Very Respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. U. FAQUHAR,

Captain, &amp;c.

MAY 12, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Can your order a part of Colonel West's command over to cut the Danville road? The rebels still have line of communication. I am at the Junction moving on Swift Creek, where the rebels under Ransom are fortifying.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

MAY 12, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

Do you wish me to understand from Farquhar's note that I am only to feel the enemy, or do you desire me to move ahead? General Turner has just joined our line.

Very respectfully,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

IN THE FIELD,

May 12, 1864 - 12.30 p. m.

[General SMITH:]

GENERAL: I sent what Farquhar wrote in order that you might have all the information I have. From that I infer the enemy is in front, so that we are at liberty to press him. I have also sent dispatch from General Gillmore's signal station. I think, unless you see something that I do not, press him vigorously.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,May 12, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

GENERAL: I have given the orders for an attack at once. Should there be no demonstration from Petersburg or no prospects of danger from that direction, O would request that a portion of General Ames' force be sent to me at this point as I have no reserve. My troops are all in the lines.

Respectfully, &c.,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
