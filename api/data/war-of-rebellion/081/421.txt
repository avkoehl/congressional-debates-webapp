FORT MONROE, June 25, 1864-11.35 a.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Colonel Hoffman inquires if we can send rebel medical officers through the lines now or soon.

JOHN E. MULFORD,

Major,&amp;c.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 25, 1864.

Major MULFORD,

Fort Monroe:

Mr. Ould having refused to allow the flag-of-truce boat to go up the river, I have no way of sending the rebel surgeons except through our lines, and I don't think that is safe; they know too much. Ould desires us to agree upon a new plan to make our exchanges, but refuses to answer officially what will be done with colored soldiers, therefore I have cut off all exchange and flag-of-truce communication.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

Major-General BUTLER:

It was General Smith's intention to carry an advanced point in front of his left last night, but finding that he had fewer men than he thought it was postponed. If he can secure this advance to-morrow night I would like it to be done.
