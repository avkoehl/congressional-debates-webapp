THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Febuaiy 14,
may be traced through the distant glade It is
his own, all his own, the fruit, the labor of his
nands,and with cheerlul delight he gazes over his
farm, and feels, with honest pude, the independ
ence of a freeholder However kind may be the
lecollections with which memory visits the paient
land, that memory is unclouded with regret, foi
he has exchanged toil for íest, penurv for plenty,
servitude for freedom If Rhode Island, as often
happens, has been his eaily home, the change is
even greater, the cause of nit> rejoicing still more
increased, lor the high instrument, the paramount
law which secuies and guaranaes his lights as a
mat),his privileges and his protection asacitizen,
is no loigei a loyal c utter, a giant canymg with
it the degrading evidence if a monaich's lute, the
humiliating admission that his 1 ingly condescension
had more wisely provided tor freedom than free
men themselves could No, he has exchanged the
goveinmentof thischartei for a constitution foi med,
perfected, adopted in all its parts, by the people
themselves, cieated at their will, based upon their
confidence, and sustained by then affection, an
honoied and living commentary upon the great
principle of human equality
It is such men as 1 haie descnbed that have
this day fallen under the denunciations of the hon
orable gentleman from Rhode Island, and whom
he thinks it would be discreditable to repiesent
on this floor For my own part, I am pioud to
acknowledge that such aie many of my constit
uents, and I appiehend they would lose but little
by any companion that might be instituted be
tween their moial condition and ehatof the people
of Rhode Island, or elsewhere The very indubtry
which they practice in,acquiring for themselves a
home, is a sufficient compensation to the Govern
merit foi her land, as it mcieases their attachment
to hei, by extending thel interest in the soil
What constitutes the wealth, the reliance, the
boast of any nation, but its population > Whit is
the gieat and paiamount object of all Government,
it it la not the promotion of happiness and security
among us people' Of all Governments that have
existed, ours professes in the highest degiee, and
is beyond doubt, in the outline, best calculated to
promote the end desired Yet with all its advan
coges, much of the machinery may be, and is,
practically misapplied
We are doing what no good Government be
side* has ever done, and what it is to be hoped
will soon be eiadicated fiom oui system—we aie
making the public domain of the country a matter
of speculation and piofil upon oui own eiuzens,
fur the puipose of increasing the Ireusury spoils
that aie annually lividecí out on this ft ¡or In
stead of tins course, weie we to portion m limited
put eels the whoie dt main as it might become set
tied by the class of otople against whom theinalh
etna oí the honorable genlleman has been directed,
weie we to divide it amongst all the industrious
pool of the whole countiy willing to become its
tenants, and reap Us hni vests, how much would
not the sum of human happiness be raised? How
immeasurably would the true wealth of the nation
be incieased'
But to this the honorable gentlemsn from Rhode
Inland, and those who act with him on the main
question involving the public lands, have an objec-
tion so deep—to the selfish politician so strong—
that, notwithstanding the coveit under which they
w>u!d fo*n hide the Hue cause, no occasion nasses
without its eihibitnn And this caiibe, and this
alone, I do from the bottom of my heart believe
has piompted the open and violent assault of the
honorable gentleman to day upon a whole lace of
peopif It is the fact that political power and
Ureoglh is gliding too mpidly fiom the East to the
West I he population of the latter, growing m
numbei, ami iluecting all then er ergies to the de-
velopment of the many resources kindly provided
by nature, presents a scene of advancing powei
that has Kindled up the jealousy of some in ti e
eastern section, who can view only the dark side
of the picture—their own downfall m the pros
perity of others Sir, it will be all m vain, no
checks can now íestram the growing piospects
of the great valley of the West Her march is
Btcady, sure, and onwaid
Against the very kind suggestions of the gentle-
man, that the proceeds fro~i the sales of the public
lands should be taken and distributed amongat the
different States, for the purpose of educating all
the children of the country, I would beg lea\e to
protest on many accounts One lesson, however,
will be sufficient at this time I do not wish to see
Rhode Ishnd raising the means for tie education
of her children out of the so,I of Indiana Let
her raise those means at home, let her educate her
own children with her own means, ard we will
educate our children in the same way We will
teach them the proper duties of the citizen instil
into the n a pure love of the free institutions of
their country, a leadmess to defend them when as
sailed by outward foes, aye,or by intestine traitors,
a just regard, too, for the feelings of all mankind in
awordfwe will teach them all that man should
be, just so much and no more, and it will be well
foi the fame of Rhode Island should the same
couise be hers m times to come
Mi Speaker, I have done The rhetorical
flourish of the gentleman in behalf of the poor
Indian requires no answer its use for sympathy,
01 ornament, in setting off a speech, however it
might suit, were the Indians concerned in the
matter before the House, is now of little avail
either way, being entirely out of place
To the merits of that class, for a portion of
whom the benefits cf the bill under consideration
aie intended, 1 have borne and can bear every tes-
timony that honest mdusti y deseives The bill
itself has my hearty wishes for its success, and
shall most coidially have my vote
Mr HUBBARD said, from some remarks
whichfell fiom the gentleman fiom Virginia, [Mi
Mason 1 he was induced to believe he had not
fully understood the subiect If the views taken
by the gentleman fiomOno [Mr Vinton] were
collect the bill should certainly be lejected In
ordei to give gentlemen a further opportunity for
investigation, he moved the House adjourn
The motion was agreed to, and
The House adjourned

The Senate then resumed the consideration, as
in Committee ot the Whole, of the bill to iepea[
that part of the act of 1820 limiting the terms of
certain offices, commonly called the four years'
law
Mr E WING rose and said, the question before
the Senate was one of the utmost importance,
and one that was deserving a most serious consid-
eration He should not feel himself bound to
sustain the bill fiom the importance of the first
and second sections, but the third involved prin-
ciples of the most momentous consequences He
had not heard anything said against that part of
the bill, that calls in question the constitutional
powers of the Executive The third section tieated
upon those powers of the Executive which had
been claimed as derived dnectly from the Consti-
tution If the President did hold these powers
from the Constitution, then the bill came in con-
tact with the Constitution itself He did not be-
lieve, however, that the Constitution gave the
power of removal from office to the Executive
He did not deny that the power might be conferred
by law, but only contended that it was not a con-
stitutional privilege The subject was not a new
one, now for the first time set forth It had been
long ago fully discussed by both Houses of Con-
gress, and very recently in the Senate, though
without coming to a derision The section under
consideration would test the opinion of the Senate
on that point The Constitution vested all execu-
tive power in the President, butthe term executive
poivet, was ambiguous,undefined,and loose in its
construction It had long been a question for
debate among statesmen, men of the gieatest tal-
ents and profoundestsagacity What was execu
tive powei,he would ask? How far did it extend >
If it was intended to vest all power in the hands
of the Executive, then it should have been more
clearly defined, and not been left uncertain and
doubtful Among the monarchies of Europe the
executive power of the Kings was unlimited, but
the framers of oui Constitution did not look to
Europe for patterns and models by which to build
up the institutions of a free people By thephrase
executive power, they did not intend to '■onfer on the
"President the power of appointment and removal
Neither was it so understood and expressed by
writers and books on executive power
Mr E ieferied to the opinions of Necker and
