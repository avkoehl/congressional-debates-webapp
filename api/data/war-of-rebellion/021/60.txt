diana regiment, under command, of Captain Noblet, was very close and severe; so much so that Manning's battery was compelled to fall back, which it did with considerable confusion, leaving one piece and caisson, the horses having been either killed or disabled. Lieutenant Whitcomb, Thirtieth Massachusetts Volunteers, gallantly dashed through the smoke of the enemy and succeeded in bringing off the caisson. The fearless Indianians secured the piece, and both were turned over to the battery on the field. Captain Manning quickly rallied his men and went into battery on the right of the Twenty-first Indiana, well supported on the right by the Seventh Vermont, Lieutenant-Colonel Fullam (Colonel Roberts having been mortally wounded), and with this battery did good service. In the mean time the enemy appeared in strong force directly in front of the Twenty-first Indiana, Seventh Vermont, and Thirtieth Massachusetts. At one time these three brave regiments stood face to face with the enemy within 40 yards of each other. For full one hour the contest for this piece of wood was terrific. At one moment the rebel Tennessee would seem to have success on their side. The tide would then turn, and the brave Twenty-first Indiana and Thirtieth Massachusetts would exchange a yell with each other, quickly advance, and drive the enemy back to the fence and into the corn field.

While this brisk work was going on directly in front the undaunted Trull, with his battery, was hotly engaged on the right with a full battery of the enemy that had cut its way through a belt of thick timber and approached within 150 yards. This is supposed to have been Semmes' celebrated battery. The Sixth Michigan, under Captain Clarke, acting lieutenant-colonel, moved up to the support of Nims' battery in elegant order. Its assistance came most fortunately, for it was clear the enemy intended to outflank us at that point. Nobly did Captain Clarke and his command discharge their duty here, as their list of killed and wounded shows. This regiment did good service on more than one occasion this day. For individual acts of gallantry I refer the commanding officer to Colonel Clarke's report.

At this juncture of the contest I ordered Lieutenant Trull to fire his three left pieces obliquely across the front of the Twenty-first Indiana, Thirtieth Massachusetts, and Seventh Vermont. This was the turning point on the right wing. This galling fire of canister, with the terrible discharge of the musketry of three regiments, effectually silenced the enemy' fire, and they withdrew again to the fields in the rear.

For the valuable aid given by Lieutenant Brown and his pieces of artillery on the right in the early part of the engagement, which prevented our being outflanked on the right, I refer to Acting Lieutenant-Colonel Clarke's report.

To the report of First Lieutenant Wm. W. Carruth, commanding Everett's battery, marked G,* I respectfully solicit the attention of the colonel commanding. His battery did not form part of my command in the morning, but from the fact that one section was sent to me it did afterward and the other fact of its having been supported by troops from the right wing (Twenty-first Indiana) you will account for his sending his report through me. The number of dead in front of his position indicate the valuable aid his battery rendered on the left.

There were very many acts of bravery which could not come under my own observation; therefore I respectfully solicit a careful perusal
