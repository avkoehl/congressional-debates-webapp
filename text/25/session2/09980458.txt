APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Independent Treasury—Mr. Duncan.
H. of Reps.
and with the most anxious desire to save him from
the consequences of a fourth disappointment, which
mighf prove very serious
Well, now, sir, in regard to this fourth and last
trial, for I think this will be the last I might fore-
tell its result without much hazard, but I will not do
that I will not *urn prophet, lest, like many-
others, I should be found a false prophet But,
sir, I have an opinion, a settled conviction, on this
subject, the result of some little observation and
reflection on past and present events My delibe-
rate opinion is, that the Senator will agau be
defeated, and that he is destined to suffer a fourth
and last political death About the year 1840 the
Senator, as well as myself, will, in all probability,
be much at leisure, when I intend to avail myself
oí his kind invitation and pay him a visit amidst
the quiet shades of Ashland, where, I doubt not,
he will find more real enjoyment than m the turbu-
lence of political strife, which has characterized
his long career.
From this brief notice of the prominent events in
the Senator's life, it is evident that his public career
will occupy a broad space in historj, jet it is
equally clear that the gist, substance, and marrow
of the whole, may be summed up m about the same
brief words as were used by him to record the
events of my public life I bel ei e that this bio-
graphy is a fair offset against his epitaph, but, jn
order to have the account not only balanced, but
paid off m kind, I will conclude it by offering an
inscription, which I think will do pretty good jus-
tice to his memory, and wh'ch he and his friends
can use or not, as they may see fit It is as fed
lows, short and simple
Here lies ihf Hon ---------, [I leave it for them
at tne proper time and place to insert the name,J a
distinguished orator, a daring political asp1-
rai.t, and four times a dffritcd candidate for
the Presidency
Mr. SEVIER rose merely for 'he purpose of
giving his reasons for the vote he was about to
give, and said that, as he was the only one of the
party with whom he almost invariably acted, that
would vote against the proposed substitute of the
honorable Senator from New York, foi the propos-
ed amendment oí the honorable Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, he must ask the mdu'genre of the Se-
nate for a single moment, m a«s gnmg h s reasons
for the vote he was about to give It n as not the
interest of the bank v Inch mUuence ' his course, --o
as they alone were concerned, he cred nc thing
about the question lie diieetors of the b nk ot
ihe Slate he hai the honoi, in part, to represent h?d
unanimously refused accepting the deposite of the
pubhemoney 110m this decision he mfei red th->t the
Bank of Arkansas con-, dued the deposito ot the
public money a matter, at best, of but tiifling i in-
put tance His objection to the substitute was, that
it proposed to repeal all law upon the subject oetne
^ale-1 eepmg ard disbui«ement of the public mo-
ney, and to leave it, as it v as by the act of 1780,
solely at the discretionof the Lticnme This was
a discretion he was unwilling to entrjst to anj
Executive It is a discretionary power that the
late Executive was unwilling to have confided to
h m, it is a discretionary power which the present
Executive is unwilling to have conferred upon him,
and, (or one, he was as unwilling to confer such
esoimous power and responsibility m the hands of
any one, as they were
We have tried our favorite expedients, said Mr
S upon the subject of the safe-keeping and dis-
bursement of the p ibhc money, and we have been
defeated on those measures, and the only question
for us now to decide is, shall we fall back on the
defunct act of 1836, or leave the whole revenue of
the country, as it was by the act of 1789, under the
unlimited control and discretion of the Executive?
Of these two evils, I prefer the former I cannot
reconcile it to my feelings to place the re\ enues of
this countiy, without lav, in the hands ot an}
one
I regret, sincerely regret, for many reasons which
I will not now take up the time of the Senate in
enumerating, that I cannot, consistently with my
notions of public duty, go with my party on this
occasion I cannot feel myself justified in going
bonus to -those to whom I owe every thing, and
whose interests in part I represent on this floor,
and say to them, that I have left the whole leve-
nues of this country, without law, at the unlimited
discretion of the Executive, although that Executive
is one of their choice, and in whom they have
every confidence that they ought to have in any
Executive
I asked of the Senate but a moment's indulgence,
for an explanation, and I will not abuse that in-
dulgence, by uttering another word upon the sub-
ject.
SPEECH OF MR  DUNCAN,
Oi Ohio,
In the House of Representatives, July 3, 1838—On
the bill to establish an Independent Treasury.
Mr DUNCAN addressed the House as follows
Mr Speaker Advanced as the session is, and
aiare of the vast quantity of unfinished business of
an important character^ both of a private and pub-
lic nature—important to individuals and important
to the public—I feel a diffidence in asking the at-
tention of the House while I offer a few ideas which
I entertain in relation to this measure, and let me
assure you, sir, I do it not from any disposition to
make a vain show, or from a pride to be heard in
the great councils of the Amencan Government for,
let me assure you, that when I rise to express my-
self on any subject, I use from a sense of duty that
I owe to those I represent, and always wnh embar-
rassment and great diffidence, knowing, as I do,
that I am surrounded by those of far superior
talents and acquirements to those of rry own—
statesmen who grace this country, and who would
be an ornament to any country and to any people
No, sir, it is the importance of the measure, and a
paramount duty, that induce me to ask >our atten-
tion at this time
Almost on every ques'ion of a general nature,
when and where it is possible to drag a parly feel-
ing, party facts, and party arguments m o discus
sion, it is universally done I knov> of no instance
where this has not oeen the case Political effect is
the object but it  ens to me that the result will
hardly wairant the design, more especially whea it
is done at the expense of prt ate and puolic busi-
ness, <>nd oí tne pul lie mone), at so great a ji pro
portion We b<ive witnessed the saci fice of d?}
ai er day in the di cussion of a simple appiopr a-
tion for \h* Fioi d-  v, or ra hpi, such was the
mcasuie lelore the liens- t i u scuss on, and yet

base and wicked mis naoageme i o* th s Adminis
tration, " id the one that prceedet it "When will

Whg¡? Prom the con raenc    f the Govern-
ment to this day, (uhi'e the D mucacy adminis-
tered tne Govern nem) this Ipsne n the cry—an
imbecile Administration, corrupt ¡un, and ruinous
measures' This kind of Fede-al howling has been
so long kept up, and is so v ell undeistood to be a
kind ot h}pocntical, crocodile Federal whimpering
that it is no longer regarded oi seriously listened to
Such murmuring and such fault-finding are the
characteristics of Federalism, and have their foun-
dation in a want f confidenee in the honesty, mte-
gnty, and capacity of the people to govern them-
selves, or, which is the same in a representative
Government, of electing those who are capable of
making, adjudicating, and executing the law  All
the democratic Administration* that have existed
since the organization of our Government, have
been administrations of the people Tney have
been elected by the peop e, and n t from personal
attachment on the part of the people to those thej
elected, but upon principle, and upon some one or
more important questions m which the whole oom-
mumty fell a deep interest
Such was the ¡act in relation to the present ad-
ministration, and to denounce an Admmis ration
which has been elected under such circumstances,
and to denounce the measures that the Adminístra-
nos are bound, by the nature of its official ex-
istence, and every obligation connected with its
duty, to carry out, is revolutionary m Us character,
subversive of our free institutions, and an indirect
denial or denunciation of one of the most impor-
tant and fundamental principles of our Govern-
ment, viz the capacity for self government and
the right to govern
Such, I say, is the situation of the present Ad-
ministra! on, and such its obligations. Certain
great and important and leading measures were
commenced by the Administration—measures in
which a great majority of the American peop'e felt
an interest in earrjmg out, anl for that purpose
was the present Chief Magistrate elected so was
the Vice President, and many of both branches of
Congress One of the most important of those
measures was the improvement of the national
currencj, and for that purpose was this measure
introduced Its object is declared by its title, its
various provisions Its importance and uti-
lity I am about to discuss, but the \ery cir-
cumstances that made its introduction not only
necessary, but absolutely obligatory, on the
powers that be, constitute the strongest argu-
ment in its favor It provides that the Govern-
ment shall collect, safely keep, and disburse its own
revenue, and, further, that it shall gradually esta-
blish the constitutional currency as the Government
revenue currency, that is, gold and silver The
suspension of specie payments by the banks, while
they had upwards of $30,000,000 of the public
money m their possession, (not a dollar of which
could be procured for a time) produced the sepa-
ration which tins bill contemplates, and vast in-
jury, loss, and expense to the Government, by this
unwarrantable measure, and, I might s<«y, high-
handed fiaad, pract ced upon the Government,
makes it important that this unnatural and danger-
ous connection never should be revived And ihe
great reduc ion in the value cf bank pape-, pro-
duced by the «ant of mtrins c value and public
confidence m it, makes it impor'ant to the highest
interests of the p opl  that the Goveinment should
return to tl p collection for us revenue to tlfe only
currency k town to the Constitution
Sir, I am in favor of continuing the separation
when exists betwepn the Gtvernment and the
bank'—a separat on modured hy he maFeasance
of the Darks themselves I i1- n\ the connection
tnat has existed h^re cfore was m vioatio of the
Constitution, and most nnq te tionab y impolitic
ai i unv is°, ca' u atcd to embarrass the Govern-
ment and derai se the currencj I sav I bei eve
such a connection to be unconstitutional Permit
me, s r heie to lay aoina proposi'ton, to which I
raaj have to reo n m the course of m} remarks.
It is tl, s that Congress can exerc se no constitu-
tional pnver, except that power be plainly autho-
rized bj expression con'amed in the Constitution,
and that the State Lesslatuus can exercise all
legitimate iegisative powers not expressiy prohi-
bited b} the Cois to ion of the I mted Slates and
the Constitutin t tnti'- nspec ive fa ates that is

stitution express y aiuhon?«=sl ? )d, the S'ate Legis-
latures can do ev en th ng (not morally wong) that
is not etpiessfj p*r>hib led by the Constitution
We find m the ninth section of the first article of
the Constitution (hese words " Zio money shall be
drawn outot the Treasury but in consequence of
ap¡ ropn-uions made b} law ' This provision
proves, b yond a do ibt, mat the framers of fhs
Constitution intended iha the General Government
should have an independe it Tieasury, and m that
Treasury the public funds should b« kept, and
from t ihe} should be d a«n out by la  There
is no other mermng tha' ca i be given to his provi-
sion, v nhout running into absolute absurd ty and
ridiculous sopl istrv If ¡t be a fact that e Gene-
ral Government s all bav e a Treasury it is equal-
ly irue that he revenue should be kept m that
T'easurv, and it is a violation of the Coa utution
to keep the public money in an} other place than
the public Treasury
Sir, it is of the first importance that the Govern-
ment should be m actual possession of its own
money, so that it may draw that rrioney "in come-
