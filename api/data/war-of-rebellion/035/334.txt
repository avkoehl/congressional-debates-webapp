Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have additional news of the movements of a considerable force of infantry and artillery from Shelbyville in this direction. It is said they are near Engleville, but this needs confirmation.

Respectfully,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: It is reported that one division of infantry is at Middleton and one near Unionville; the former under Cheatham and Smith, the latter under Withers. They arrived here on the 12th, and were seen there on the 14th. This report comes in pretty reliable shape.

The impression among the people in front of our lines seems to be that the rebel army is advancing.

The following report was received immediately after the above:

Colonel Crews, commanding a rebel cavalry brigade, and three colonels commanding cavalry regiments, came up to near Harpeth this morning, with about 400 men. They appear to be examining the crossings of the Harpeth above and below Chapel Hill pike. They were followed by our cavalry to near Jordan's Store, where Crews' brigade appears to be.

KELLY,

Signal Officer.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CINCINNATI, May 16, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

In your dispatch from Gilbert yesterday, Gilbert speaks of sending a small force to invest the rebels about Cumberland Gap and capturing their pickets. Ask him if he thinks if I should send him an organized force of say 5,000 men, he could proceed in the same way and capture and hold the Gap itself. Let him think of it and answer.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
