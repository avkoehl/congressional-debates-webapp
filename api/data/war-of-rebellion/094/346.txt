General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Captain F. H. Ruger, assistant quartermaster, in charge of advance depot of army, now at Spring Hill, reports great thefts and robberies by troops and others, and says he is without sufficient guards. I have telegraphed him to call on your headquarters for all necessary guards now or hereafter, and respectfully request that his requisitions be honored accordingly. I need scarcely say that it is of the first importance that your advance depot be well regulated and well protected, and supplied with ample details for guards to public property at all times.
