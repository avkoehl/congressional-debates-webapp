Vicksburg, April 15, 1863.

Major R. W. MEMMINGER, Assistant Adjutant-General, Jackson.

MAJOR: The following is an extract from a letter of Colonel Ferguson of the 12th instant:

In this connection I would call your attention to the five prisoners sent down who acknowledge that they had been led to the east bank of Deer Creek by their captain to steal horses and mules and burn everything. They were caught on stolen animals and had in their possession articles of private property stolen from residences, and were recognized as those who had set fire to the corn on the De Holb Plantation. Will not our Government make an example of them?

Can these men be held in retaliation for James?

I am, major respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
