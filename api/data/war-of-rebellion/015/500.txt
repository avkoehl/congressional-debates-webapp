of my men was killed and 14 taken prisoners. My command, consisting of about 1,400 men for duty, is scattered over a distance of 55 miles, and their safety is continually imperiled. I have telegraphed General Wadsworth that I consider it indispensably necessary for the safety of the command that we should be strongly re-enforced without any delay. I am informed that 2,600 cavalry, of Jackson's command, are disbanded to form guerrilla bands for the purpose of attacking this line. General Ewell is also near Luray, with a rebel force of about 8,000 men. I cannot too strongly call your attention to the necessity for re-enforcements.

Very respectfully,

JNO. W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

RECTORTOWN, May 16, 1862.

SIR: Dispatches have been to-day received from General Wadsworth and orders obeyed. A company of infantry of my command was yesterday ordered to Linden, to remain stationed there. A detachment of 17 men, the company wagon, reached there a short time before the main body of the company, which was on a train. They were attacked by a body of cavalry, variously estimated from 300 to 600, coming upon them from four directions. Our men resisted them, keeping up a sharp firing under shelter of the depot, which was riddled with bullets. My men were overpowered; 1 was killed and 14 taken prisoners, 3 of whom were wounded. When the balance of the company came up the enemy hastily retired under fire, and with some loss.

I have been informed that a portion of General Shields' command had a skirmish with them. Sharp firing was heard from between Chester Gap and Warrenton.

I have reliable authority to-day that the enemy is south of us in threatening attitude. They are represented as being in strong cavalry parties. I will resist any attack to the last extremity. The safety of the roads depends upon an early concentration of forces, as I have from the first stated.

Your orders relative to block-houses, &amp;c., are being executed. I have passed and repassed trains over the road to-day under heavy escort to near Strasburg.

Very respectfully,

JNO. W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
