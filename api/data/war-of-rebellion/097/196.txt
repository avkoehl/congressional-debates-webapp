do not know of any objection to the latter, except his troop will not be quite so well in hand as if massed near Hather's Run. I think, however, his movement ought ot be concealed from the enemy if practicable.

GEO. G. MEAD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 27, 1865-3 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

General Ord draws his troops out of the position they now occupy to-night. They cannot march at night, however, the whole distance without losing a great number of men by straggling, and as they will be in view of the enemy most of the time after they reach Broadway Landing I do not think it possible to conceal his movement. His instructions are to get up so as to relieve the Second Corps pickets as early on Wednesday as possible. I will also instruct Ord to conceal pickets of the Second Corps that Ord will replace, and the command will be in compact marching order near to Hatcher's Run.

Major-General MEADE:

A prisoner who returned from Richmond makes the following statement:

I saw General McLaughlen yesterday morning in Richmond. He wished me to communicate with General Grant that the works in front of Battery 5 were not strong enough. The enemy intended to make another demonstration on that point and was strengthening his own works on that line.

General Sherman is here and will remain until about noon to-morrow. I did not ask you to come in to-night because I did not know but you might be needed where you are in the morning. If all is quiet suppose you come in to-morrow morning.
