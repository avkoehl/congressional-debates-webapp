CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

must permit him to say, in reply, that he, for one,
was perfectly wi'l ng and held himself prepared,
to deride that question, either in the committee or
in the Hoube , and, for one, he was perfectly wil-
ling to submit the question to the nation Since
we, sir, continued Mr C have been diawn out on
this question, I hope gen leñen on the other side
will be as bold and as frank as the President of the
United States has been Let them take their
ground The glove i« thrown L"t them come
forward with their proposi ions They have been
talking so long about non committalism, let them
come forw ard now, imitate the example of the
Presdent, and not lav dark From the organs,
abroad, it may be interred that we are not now to
have the question of the Ba lk of the United
States That question may be postponed be-
yond the fall elections but, sir, that that issue we
shall come to at last, is as certain as the noonday
sun The gieat issue will be between the Bank
of the United States, and the proposition whethei
the finances of the country can be, and shall be,
managed without any bank or banks at all
That is the great question, and I hope the Com-
mittee of Way s and Means w ill concur w ith
me in fi? i m« some b II to dispense with all
banks That is the real question for the He use to
de eimme Whethei that question w ould settled re
now, or deferred till the fill elections, was foi the
consideration of the House, and net for the com-
mittee, and I trust the House will not be kept here
beyond three or four weeks
