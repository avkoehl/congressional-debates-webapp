Since making the above estimate the chief surgeon informs me that he cannot do without at least 500 nurses and attendants, which will increase the sum to over a million, if the orders of General Taylor are enforced. You will at once see the effect. I have not yet seen any inconvenience arising from it. I don't forward these documents by way of remonstrance, but to ask further instructions. The surplus prisoners at Cahaba ordered by you to be brought to this post have been, by order of General Taylor, sent to Meridian.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO H. WINDER,

I. The attention of commands of posts and all other officers having charge of prisoners of war is called to the laxity with which prisoners are guarded and the improper privileges which are extended to them.

II. While undue rigor and severity in the keeping and treatment of prisoners are to be avoided, it is expected and required that prisoners of war will be confined within properly restricted bounds, and intercourse with citizens and negroes forbidden and prevented.
