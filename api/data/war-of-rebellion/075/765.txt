HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,In the Field, June 9, 1864.

TO DIVISION COMMANDERS:

The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to inform you that scouts report that the enemy are advancing in force in our front, along the railroad and the Big Shanty and the Marietta dirt road, and that he wishes you to strengthen your position as much as possible to-night without fatiguing your men too much.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Kirk's House, June 9, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you conform your movements to those of General Loring, moving to the right. You will move your pickets, skirmishers, line of battle, reserves, artillery, ordnance and ambulance trains to the right, so that your right will unite with Loring's left, and be in order of battle when you halt.

I am, general, with much respect.

DOUGLAS WEST,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

This has been shown me, and I understood the order to be that I should leave my skirmishers and remove the line of battle and reserves, but nothing said about artillery.

JAS. CANTEY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. ROSS' BRIGADE, JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,In Front of Lost Mountain, Ga., June 9, 1864-10 a.m.

General VAUGHAN,

Commanding Infantry:

GENERAL: There is an army corps extending from about opposite Davis' house to a point near Leverett's gin (Twenty-third Corps). They are preparing to move, I think. I can see their skirmishers and reserves folding and packing up their blankets, &amp;c. They are beating drums all along their lines, and are moving and falling into line along their breast-works in small squads. I see they are doubling their lie clue they are not relieving those on duty.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
