HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Camp, May 26, 1864-3 p.m.

General McPHERSON,

Near Dallas:

I don't hear of you at all. What are you doing? I have heard no firing in your direction. I have turned the right flank of the enemy, but don't care to push the advantage till I hear from you.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Dallas, May 26, 1864-8.40 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Inclosed please find sketch* of our position to-night. Garrard's cavalry occupies pretty much the same position as last night. We entered this place shortly before 2 p.m. to-day, General Davis' skirmishers and my own coming in about the same time. It was 10.30 to-day before General Dodge's command got across Pumpkin Vine Creek, although a portion of his command marched nearly all night. As soon as he was up we moved forward, the Fifteenth Army Corps by the road leading from Pumpkin Vine Church, and General Dodge by the direct road from Van Wert. I do not think there was anything but cavalry in town, and we entered it after a very little skirmishing, but, on moving out to our present position on the Marietta road, we found the enemy apparently in strong force; also on the Villa Rica road. I shall move against them in the morning. The direction of my advance and the nature of it will depend very materially upon the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
