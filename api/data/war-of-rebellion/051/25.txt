Under all the circumstances we could not have anticipated more satisfactory results, and feel that the protection of a merciful Providence has been extended to us at a time when the safety of our cause was involved.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General, Commanding.

General S. COOPER,

Adjt. and Insp. General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Three Miles South of Chattanooga, September 29, 1863.

SIR: Herewith will be found an approximate return of the killed, wounded, and missing at Chickamauga.* Some of the missing are returning, and many of the wounds reported are very slight. Returns from the cavalry have not been received. They will swell the aggregate to nearly if not quite 18,000.

A field return of the present effective strength (infantry and artillery) is also inclosed. The enemy far exceeds us in strength now, and is rapidly and heavily re-enforcing. Every available man should be pushed to our assistance.

The question of subsistence should receive early attention, as our supplies are nearly exhausted at Atlanta.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.

Adjt. and Insp. General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.
