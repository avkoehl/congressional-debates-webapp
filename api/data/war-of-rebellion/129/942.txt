to meet these demands, I rely upon-

Half the money tax proposed ($215,000,000). . . . . . . . . . . 107,500,000

Half the sale of bonds estimated for the year

($409,000,000). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 204,500,000

I beg the committee to take notice that on the 1st of day January the Treasury will be entirely empty; and that there will be nothing after that day to satisfy the requisitions but the funds to arise from the sale of bonds.

Assuming that the recommendations I have ventured to submit in relation to the money tax (which is clearly indispensable) shall be adopted, the collection from that source will not begin to come in before the month of June; but I rely with confidence upon the ability to anticipate the collections to be extent of $107,000,000 by temporary loans.

There is obviously some risk of embarrassment in depending upon this expedient, but it is all can be done apparently under existing circumstances, and I would respectfully and earnestly impress upon the committee the importance of acting with promptitude, and thereby inspiring confidence in the adequacy of our future resources.

That a money tax is indispensable is plain; that less than the sum mentioned in the report will be insufficient seems equally clear, and I venture with great deference to suggest that the plan of taxation proposed will raise the requisite amount, and is strongly recommended by the consideration that it makes the smallest possible departure from the existing system.

With renewed thanks to the committee for the patient attention they have accorded to the communications I have been impelled by a sense of duty to address them.

I have the honor to remain, your most obedient servant,

G. A. TRENHOLM,

Secretary of the Treasury.
