IN SENATE.
Tuesday, February 10,1846.
A message was received from the House of Rep-
resentatives, announcing that said House had pass- j1
ed a joint resolution of notice to Great Britain to i|
annul and abrogate the convention concluded on !j
tiie 6th day of August, 1827, relative to the ooun- j|
try on the northwest coast of America, west of the
Stony mountains, commonly known as the terri-
tory of Oregon, in which the concurrence of the I,
Senate was requested. j|
Also, announcing that the Speaker of the House i|
had signed an enrolled bill, to which the Vice Pros- lt
ident also was requested to affix his signature. j:
Mr. SPEIGHT submitted a series of resolutions j
adopted by the Legislature of the State of Missis- 1
sippi, in relation to the Oregon territory, declaring !I
the approval by that body of the course pursued ,|
by the Executive in relation to the Oregon tern- Â«:
tory: pledging to the General Government the sup- ;i
port of that State m maintaining the rights of the
United States to said territory; and declaring their !;
assent to the principle of non-interference on the ,
part of any foreign nation in the alfairs of the j|
American continent. i'
In submitting the resolutions, Mr. S. remarked j
that they were declaratory only of the views of!,
that body from which they emanated, and con- '!
tained no instructions to himself or his colleague, ;
[Mr. Chalmers.] This he considered as a high j|
compliment, that while the Legislature of Ins State j!
had acted upon the subject, they had left their Sen- |:
ators to act independently thereon. Mr. S. was a ''
believer in the ris'ht of instruction; and repeated
his gratification that, on this important question, he
and his colleague were left free to act according to
their discretion. He would, however, endeavor to
carry out the will of his constituency. He re-
quested that the resolutions should be read, and
ordered to be printed; and it was so ordered.
Mr. CHALMERS concurred entirely in the
views which had been expressed by his colleague, .
and stated his readiness to yield to the right of in-
struction. Considering that war was second only
to national dishonor, so long as he held a seat
here, he would do nothing which he thought had
a tcndcncy to promote the one while it could be
avoided without tarnishing the other.

Mr. CASS remarked that the special order of
the day should, in his opinion, be first acted upon,

it; and as this was the day assigned for it, he could
see no objection to taking it up.

the previous order be postponed, in order to pro-
ceed to the consideration of the special order of
