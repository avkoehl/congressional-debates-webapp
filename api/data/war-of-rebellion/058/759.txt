DALTON, February 17, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

Richmond:

In a dispatch dated New Market, Tenn., February 15, General Longstreet complains that I do not cut off re-enforcements and supplies from Knoxville. Weakness in cavalry has prevented me. I am expecting Roddey with an addition and send an officer to confer with General Longstreet. Their fortifications at Chattanooga and Knoxville now enable the enemy to unite his forces against one or the other of us.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DALTON, February 17, 1864.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET,

New Market, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of 15th received. I have been too weak in cavalry to interfere between Chattanooga and Knoxville; am expecting an addition. The route can best be broken between the Hiwassee and Loudon. Can you send a strong body of cavalry there to co-operate with mine? Can you occupy southeast of Knoxville? It is important that we should be in communication; otherwise, the enemy, being fortified at both ends of their line, may unite all their forces upon one of us and then the other. I cannot move nearer to you. Can you move nearer to me?

J. E. JOHNSTON.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

Numbers 22. Dalton, Ga., February 17, 1864.

The system of cavalry tactics prepared by Major-General Wheeler is adopted for the use of the cavalry of the Army of Tennessee.

By command of General Johnston:

KINLOCH FALCONER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEW MARKET, February 17, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Cannot you send me force enough to insure the capture of the army at Knoxville-say 10,000 men? They will have to be supplied with rations from the east; thirty days' ought to be enough. Please answer at once.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,February 17, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Orange Court-House:

It is reported that General Sedgwick is moving west to re-enforce here. Is this the case, and can I expect re-enforcements if it is?

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
