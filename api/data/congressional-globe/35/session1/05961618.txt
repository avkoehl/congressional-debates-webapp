THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 16,
and offenses which have been heaped up moun-
tain-high before us, should do something, do it
quickly, and do-it well, in order to restore good
order and good government to the people of this
Clt{t is claimed, by some that the people of the
District of Columbia have the right of popular
sovereignty, that great panacea for all the evils
of the people, which was preached upon every
stump m 1856, before the election of the Presi-
dent, and repudiated now by every Democrat in
this House except twenty-two. That popular
sovereignty, which was preached all over the
length and breadth of the land, from Maine to
California, and from the Pacific to the Lakes, be-
fore Buchanan was elected, and repudiated here,
is now to be claimed for this District. The right
of sovereignty of this District is in the United
States, and can only be exercised by the rep-
resentatives of the people, and not by the people
of the District. Why try to make anything more
out of this popular sovereignty idea? It is dead
and gone. You have gained the only victory you
will ever gain on any such ground as that. It
â– was a bad investment.
Now, sir, inasmuch as my proposition is not
up, and wishing to be distinctly understood, I say
I shall vote against the proposition of the gentle-
man from Virginia as it now stands; but, if he
will put it into such a shape that I can vote for it,
I will go as far as I can, consistently with my con-
victions of right, in order to give pcace and quiet
to the people of this District.
I am giad that this discussion has taken place,
that the people may know what kind of socicty,
and what kind of municipal lobulations we have
in this city; for, if the Representatives should go
home, and tell what crimes are committed here,
their constituents would think they had become
insane in the capital of the nation. Yet, when all
testify to it upon the floor of this House, no man
can doubt the truth of what lias been said; and I
fear half the truth has not been told, and never
will be. Hoping something will be done that will
result beneficially to the people of the District, 1
leave this matter with the committee for its action,
without anything further from me.
Mr. KELSEY. I move that the committee do
now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, re-
ported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
the state of the Union generally under consider-
ation, and particularly the special order, being
Senate bill " To establish an auxiliary guard for
the protection of public and private property in
the city of Washington, and repealing all acts
heretofore passed in relation to that subject;" and
had come to no resolution thereon.
And then, on motion of Mr. KELSEY, (at
twenty minutes after four o'clock, p. m.,) the
House adjourned.

DEFICIENCY BILL.
Mr. HUNTER. The Committee on Finance
have directed me to report back the bill (II. R.
No. 306) to supply deficiencies m the appropria-
tions for the service of the fiscal year ending the
30th of June, 185tf, with some amendments. I
give notice that, to-morrow, I shall ask the Sen-
ate to consider the bill. I shall not ask to have
it taken up to-day, because a response has not
been received to the call made by the Senator
from Maine [Mr. Fessenden] for information.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Before the report made by
the Senator from Virginia passes from the Sen-
ate, I should like to inquire what the amendments
reported are? If they are important ones, I trust
they will be printed. I know that, at former ses-
sions of Congress, the appropriation bills have
come in, and numerous amendments have been
t reported without there being any opportunity to
: see them or know what they were. I trust the
: amendments, if they are of any importance what-
| ever, will be printed, that wc may see them be-
j fore they come up for consideration.
Mr HUNTER. There are only two small
amendments, and the bill will be printed as
amended, under the rule, without any order; but
I am willing that an order shall be made for the
printing, if necessary.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If it is to be printed, it is
all I ask.
