from crossing to the north bank. General Beatty's brigade (Third), Third Division, is sent at 3.30 p. m. General Schofield received a telegram from General Thomas, stating that he had heard from General A. J. Smith, who was at Clarksville, and he expected him to arrive in Nashville last night. As the enemy is pressing us hard and endeavoring to cross the river ins several places with his cavalry and infantry, we may be obliged to fall back to Nashville before General Smith can reach us; this to prevent the enemy from getting between us and Nashville. 3.45 p. m., reports come front he front that the enemy is forming for an assault. General Beatty is directed to post his brigade on the left flank of the fort, on the river. instead of going to Hughes' Mill. All of the troops here are posted, save Wood's division, Fourth Corps, as follows: On the right, Kimball's division, Fourth Corps; center, Cox's division, Twenty-third Corps; left, Ruger's brigade, of his division, Twenty-third Corps.* Two brigades of Wagner's division, Fourth Corps, Lane's and Conrad's, are posted outside of the line of works, or bridge-head, on the Columbia pike, in advance of Cox's division. After the first assault of the enemy Wagner's two brigades were drawn back, and occupied part of the line held by Cox at first. As soon as Wagner's two brigades were drawn back to the main line a large number of Cox's men broke and ran. The enemy, driving hard after these two brigades, entered the lines at this point. Opdycke's brigade, of Wagner's division, being in reserve, was ordered up at this moment by General Stanley. The rebels were driven back an our line of works reoccupied. Here General stanley was severely wounded. Why were these two brigades left out in such an exposed position, and why did not General Schofield order them in? The barricades thrown up stretch from the river on the east of the town to the river on the west. The line is about a mile and a half long, and commands the approaches via the Columbia pike, Carter's Creek pike, and Lewisburg pike. The enemy's assaults were made by columns, generally seven lines deep, battalion front, and covered by a line of battle. The general assaults were made by six or seven columns, on of which was cavalry dismounted. 7 p. m., the enemy has been steadily fighting up to this hour since 4 p. m. He has made not less than four vigorous and determined assaults, each one of which was handsomely repulsed. In addition to these, six or seven weak attempts were made. 7.30 p. m., General Wilson reports to General Schofield that Jackson's division, of Forrest's cavalry, crossed the river at Hughes' Mill this afternoon, and that General Hatch whipped him badly and drove him back across the river. 8 p. m., our trains now moving to Nashville, save headquarters and ammunition trains, which will stop at Brentwood. In accordance with instructions from General Schofield, Wagner and Kimball are instructed to withdraw from the enemy's front and to cross to this side of the river at 12 midnight, and the pickets to be withdrawn at daylight. If we can withdraw the troops will march at once for Brentwood. The troops of the Twenty-third Corps will be withdrawn at the same time and follow the Fourth Corps in the march to B[rentwood]. It is very doubtful whether these troops can be withdrawn, as they are very close to the enemy, with whom they are keeping up a continual skirmish fire. The enemy also makes frequent feeble assaults, evidently with the view to prevent our withdrawal. The enemy's attacks to-day were made
