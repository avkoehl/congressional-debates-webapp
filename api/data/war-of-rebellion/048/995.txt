although on of the parties had a skirmish on Tuesday night with a squad of Mosby's men, killing 1 and capturing several. A company of the Black Horse Cavalry was reported in Prince William County.

We captured a lieutenant and several of the men from it. We have brought in 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, 17 privates (10 of them being Mosby's men, the others of the Fourth, Eighth, and Twelfth Virginian Cavalry); also 10 citizens and 1 rebel forage contractor, all believed to be connected with Mosby or with the Fourth Virginia. Eight of them were taken at the same place with the officer and men of the latter regiment, and being all young and able-bodied, are believed to be recruits or conscripts. They were unarmed when taken.

I have to report 1 man of the Second Massachusetts Cavalry wounded (not seriously), and 1 man captured carrying a dispatch. One man of the Thirteenth New York Cavalry was taken in a house where he was breakfasting, having left his post on picket. His horse and equipments were not taken. No other losses reported.

We bring in 25 horses and 10 or 15 sets of equipments and arms.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. LOWELL, JR.

Colonel Second Mass. Cavalry, Commanding Cavalry Camp.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Taylor,

Chief of Staff, and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[P. S.] - This man has just come in, having lost horse, arms, and equipments, and with a parole from Captain Turner. Shall evening reports in the future be sent direct or through General Tyler?

DECEMBER 30, 1863 - SKIRMISH NEAR GREENVILLE, N. C.

Reports of Major General John J. Peck, U. S. Army.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., January 2, 1864.

GENERAL: Justice to the officers and men requires that I should call your attention to another affair near Greenville as creditable to our arms as several others previously reported. The following order contains the salient points:

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,

Numbers 2 NEW BERNE, N. C., JANUARY 2 1864.

Colonel McChesney, commanding Pamplico Sub-District, while reconnoitering on the night of the 30th ultimo, within 6 miles of Greenville, with about 140 men of the Twelfth New York Cavalry, First North Carolina Volunteers, and Twenty-third New York Artillery, was attacked by a superior force under Major Moore, who attempted to cut off his return to Washington. After a hand-to-hand conflict the enemy retired, leaving 1 lieutenant and 5 men dead, with 1 piece of Starr's fine battery, and caisson and horses. Darkness prevented further knowledge of the injuries sustained by the rebels. Our loss was 1 killed, 6 slightly wounded, 1 missing, and 3 horses disabled.

With regret the general announces the death of Lieutenant William K. Adams, of Company L, First North Carolina Volunteers, a gallant and dashing officer, who fell while making a charge at the head of his command.

The commanding general thanks Colonel McChesney, the officers, men, and guides for this bold and successful affair.

By command of Major-General Peck:

E. T. PARKINSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
