Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

I have the honor to report that I crossed but one division at Fite's Ferry, the ford being deep. During the crossing I discovered two trestle bridges about one mile above the ferry, over which I can cross the balance of my command with its trains without delay. The ford at this point is still deeper, but with the aid of two ferry-boats which I find here I shall be able to cross my corps without much delay: in fact, I hope to have it over to-night.
