í[John Quincy Adams, e«q
' This will inform you that your viilanous course in Con

very soon change youi course death will be your portion    Pre
pare, prepaie, for, by the-----■ of——, you will unexpectealy
be hmried into etemuy, wheie you ought to have been long

This, was a mere samp'e of a very considerable correspond
ence, passive on his part which he had íeceived, now and
heretofore, from this legion, m which, he was toid that hits villa
nous course was wa ched And the gentleman from Albemar e
had watched it Tpis lettei was postmarked Norfolk, Virginia
Nor was this alone the operation of the coirespondcnce He
had here a picturesque representation [.which he exhibited to
the Hou^e] of himself, with the mark of what appeared a riñe
ball,'at the shortest distance" on the head, andjj the word
"abolition' written over On the sides were the words ' ?nenp
teketupharsm" He ptesumed that members of this House
knew where it came I rom Underneath were the woids, "Stop
the music (precisely the words the gentleman (mm Albemarle
had used) of John Jersey Adams, the sixth President of the
United States, who,
Iione revolving •woon,
Is statesman, poet, babbler, and buffoon
The gentleman fiom Albemarle had used the word fiddler,
which was here supplied by babblei 1 hat he was a babblei
he could not deny, but that he was a fiddiei was i new di^co
very [Alauah] It was the gentleman from ASbemaile who
announced his intention at that time to stop the mu&ic of this
"statesman, poet, fiddler, and bu loon ' And he seemed to have
made marvellous pro^ss in t s m enuon to ston his music
He (Mr A ) would not undeitake to & or_ the gentleman's mu

ed to play n hi3 elbiti) stop his music Now becau e the
House might laugh a Utile, the gentleman would perhaps con
sider it asa proof of hi  charge of buffoonery He assured the
gentleman that whatever he said now was serious He hoped
it would not be m the ^eml-mian a po ffti to stop his music, be
it what it wou'd, as long a^ he did nothing more than his duty as
a repiesentative in this House The gentleman had spoken
about the "setting sun," and the 'eplendul rnei dian ' He
would put it to this Ho us*, not to the gentleman fi ira Albe

and vigor of body and mm J, could íeproach—in addition to
charging anothei member with hiving one foot in the grave—
could teproaoh him here with his mfnmitie
If it was true, a=, the mock petition from Geoigia cnarced,
that he was , fiom insanity or monomania, mcompeten to act
as chauman ot tne Committee on Foieign Afiaii«, I<H the
House pronounce him to be that insane perbon But when I e
gen leman said that he had no personal, sectional, or party feel
mgs, he asked whether it was believed, and whe*her the House
supposed that hi-s notion could ha\e come Irom any o her sec
tionol this. Union1 No New Hampshne would not due to
bring forwaid a proposition of this kind against him although
her member migh be in the coa!itio i dec ared by Clement C

How was it now1 Why, for presenting a petition coming from
the fiee states of this Union, under the supposition of gentle-
men from Virginia, that the right of petition «self was to be
pj ostia* el he washeie to be doomed to the indignation of all
mankind when he had declared, from the bottom of his soul,
that he disapproved of the petition—that he could no* vote for
if—and had called on the House, m the very first act ofieceiv-
iiff it to fspiess their condemnation of it lie waato beheld up
bene by ^ unmans a-9if he was the leader and head, not only of
the Abolition pai y, but of a dissolution party, a British party;
not only influenced by British leelings and assistance, but by
British money
He must c'ose this part of his defence—for he had now for
the lirst time entered on hi  defence— by saying that it was im
expected, most oerfectly unexpected to him, when he knew
what th^se great irlbn of the RevoWtionary times, who were
Viginid-ns, thou htoi slavery—of he institution to which now
eveivíthi g was-    be sacrificed—when he nowsaw members
