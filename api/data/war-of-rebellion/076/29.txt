WM. T. CLARK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MARIETTA, GA., July 3, 1864-10 a.m.

(Received 5 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

The movement on our right caused the enemy to evacuate. We occupied Kenesaw at daylight and Marietta at 8.30 a.m. Thomas is moving down the main road, toward the Chattahoochee; McPherson toward the mouth of Nickajack on the Sandtown road. Our cavalry is on the extreme flank. Whether the enemy will halt this side of Chattahoochee or not will soon be known. Marietta is almost entirely abandoned by its inhabitants, and more than a mile of the railroad iron is removed between the town and the foot of Kenesaw. I propose to press the enemy close till he is across the Chattahoochee River, when I must accumulate stores and better guard my rear.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
