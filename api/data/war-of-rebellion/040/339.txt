They are back from the river nearly a mile. I think the earthworks on the bank of the curve in the river 1 mile south from Banks' Ford are well supplied.

BALLOON IN THE AIR,

May 1, 1863-12.30 p. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Left Wing, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: In a west-northwest direction about 12 miles, an engagement is going on. Can see heavy smokes and hear artillery. In a west-southwest direction about 4 miles, artillery is moving toward the engagement. A large force of the enemy are now digging rifle-pits, extending from Deep Run to down beyond the lower crossing, just by the edge of the woods at the foot of the opposite heights. There are but few troops in sight now, except those manning batteries and in the rifle-pits. There appears to be a strong force in the rifle-pits.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronauts, Army of the Potomac.

MAY 1, 1863-12.50 p. m.

General SEDGWICK:

GENERAL: The enemy have advanced their skirmishers to the river in front of this place, and now occupy the rifle-pits. They are also advancing their skirmishers across the field to my right. I can see nothing south of the Massaponax.
