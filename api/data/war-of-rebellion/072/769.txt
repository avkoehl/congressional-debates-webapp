very heavy, but upon my part of the line they mostly overshot us. The names of the wounded appear in the list. The next day was spent in advancing our lines and fortifying. Toward evening heavy fighting was heard on our left. The attack was intended for our corps, but they struck the line too far to our left and encountered Hooker's, Howard's, and one brigade of Johnson's forces, where they got most decently thrashed. On the night of the 21st the enemy again fell back, and on the next morning it was officially stated in camp that Atlanta was evacuated. We moved upon the place with high hopes and firm step, but when within some three miles of there it was ascertained that it was all a ruse of the enemy; that they still held the place, but had so managed as to make some of our superior officers believe that they had left, that they might attack and surprise us when carelessly marching into the city. Instead of going farther, we immediately formed our lines and confronted their fortifications with works equally as strong. On the 24th my regiment was sent to fortify and hold a hill some three-quarters of a mile in our front, which we did under a very heavy picket fire. While intrenching we lost 1 man killed and 1 wounded; their names appear in the list attached. On the morning of the 31st we moved with our corps to the extreme right of the army, a distance of some six miles, where, after driving back the enemy, we took position in prolongation of the mainline and threw up works. On 3rd day of August my regiment, Eighty-ninth Ohio, and Twenty-third Missouri, all under my command, were sent out to the front in conjunction with the Second Brigade of our division, on a reconnaissance to ascertain the distance to and strength of the enemy's works. The duty was accomplished under heavy fire, and with considerable loss to some of the regiments. In mine but 1 man was hurt, to wit, John H. Sexton, Company H, badly stunned with a shell. On the 5th we were moved to a new position on the front line, and again had to fortify under heavy fire. On this day Morgan Jordan, Company C, was wounded. From the time we left Ringgold to the 6th of this month (when General Palmer, our corps commander was relieved) we have never been out of range of the enemy's guns. During all that time the men and officers have been exposed to the rain and dust which, under a tropical sun, have been almost beyond the powers of human endurance; yet all believing that they were engaged in the most sacred and just cause upon earth, have marched, worked, and fought without a single murmur. In a general summary, such as I have given, it is an impossibility for me to do my officers and men justice for the labors that they have performed, but suffice it to say that all have done their duty nobly and faithfully, never faltering in the hour of peril and danger, for which I return to them my sincere thanks. When we started on the campaign we had 328 effective men and officers; we have lost in killed and wounded up to the 6th of this month, 39.* We had at that date but about 200 men for duty. The loss over and above the 39 were those that became exhausted in the fatigue of the march and were back in hospital sick. Our brigade was commanded from the beginning of the campaign to July 15 by Brigadier General John B. Turchin, since by Colonel Moses B. Walker, Thirty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry. For the efficient manner in which they have conducted the manage-
