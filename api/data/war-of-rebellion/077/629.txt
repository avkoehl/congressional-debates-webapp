HUNTSVILLE, ALA., October 2, 1864.

Captain RAMSEY, Chattanooga:

CAPTAIN: My command reached here at 8 p. m., yesterday. The road had been but slightly torn up-once at a point twelve miles from Stevenson and again six miles from Huntsville. The forces threatening Huntsville left yesterday morning toward Athens; from all I can learn the number was not large. I am satisfied that Forrest himself was not here. Athens and Pulaski road no doubt is badly torn up. I found the Huntsville and Stevenson road poorly protected. I hold my teams here; am having rations issued to the command. The balance of THIRD Brigade not yet arrived. I do not feel at liberty to move from here before hearing from you.

J. D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain RAMSEY, Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I understand your last dispatch to move by railroad up to obstructions, and then to cover working parties toward Athens. This I shall at once do unless you otherwise order. Plenty of bread and coffee here; short everything else. I will send the train back as directed.

J. D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain RAMSEY,

A. A. G., Major-General Thomas' Staff, Bridgeport and Stevenson:

Your dispatch just received. The THIRD Brigade just arrived. Working party on the Decatur railroad will probably complete the road to the junction to-day. The road from thence to Athens, I am in hopes, will also be completed; if so, I shall move with my whole command by rail, understanding that to be your order. Please answer if I misunderstood.

J. D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

Captain RAMSEY,

A. A. G., Major-General Thomas' Staff, Nashville, Tenn.:

My command has just reached this point. Most of yesterday and all night repairing railroad between Huntsville and the Decatur Junction. The road from junction to this point all right; from this to Athens the road badly cut up. Citizens living here inform me that rebel cavalry moved toward Tennessee River night before last and yesterday morning. Our forces have possession of Athens.

J. D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.
