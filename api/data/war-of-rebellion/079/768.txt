the roads near Shoal Creek and the Waynesborough and Florence road filled in with timber. If they do not advance this abatis will enable me to move safely by the right lank should it be necessary for me to do so. Most of the roads leading to Shoal Creek wind through deep ravines and can be obstructed with timber. I send General Stanely a map of the ground, rather rough, but will show our position.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, November 13, 1864 -5 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Columbia:

Have the pontoons arrived at Columbia? I still hear rumors of a portion of Forrest's command having crossed the Tennessee above Clifton and having advanced on the road between Waynesborugh and Columbia. Send out scouts in that direction and find out the truth.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

PULASKI, November 13, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch of 5 p. m. is received. The pontoons have arrived at Columbia and will be laid in the morning. I have ordered Cox to march to this place with his DIVISION, leaving the brigade of Ruger's DIVISION at Columbia until my trains arrived. I will send about one half of Capron's command to Lawrenceburg, with orders to scout constantly toward Waynesborough. General Stanley thinks the report of the enemy's movement toward Columbia arises from foraging parties on Indian Creek, but I will ascertain the fact.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
