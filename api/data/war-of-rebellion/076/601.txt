HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 19, 1864-7.30 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

Your dispatch is received. General Stanley, on the other flank, is operating in like manner. General Garrard, with his remaining brigade, was to be in Decatur at daylight to move toward Flat Rock and engaged a brigade of cavalry on that flank, and move off toward Stone Mountain and swing round toward camp, to repeat the same to-morrow morning. If my presence is wanted over there let me know, and I come at once. All is not yet satisfactory to our rear.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Near Atlanta, Ga., August 19, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I will reconnoiter forward to a point where I can better watch the enemy and be ready to attack him if he shows any sign of movement.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 19, 1864-10.15 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have your dispatch. I have heard from General Kilpatrick at 11 o'clock last night, five miles south of Camp Creek. Ross' brigade in his front and retreating. He reported he would be on the Macon road at 12.30 to-day. Keep your cavalry well out as vedettes, and demonstrate as strong as you can. General Stanley is at work to the other flank.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.

SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS, August 19, 1864-2 p. m.

General SHERMAN:

We have extended our demonstration along the enemy's line as far as the large battery on the Newman road. My skirmishers are now within 300 yards of that battery. The enemy has been compelled to bring up reserves and occupy his works in force. I am now sending another force still farther to the right to threaten the enemy's left.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 29, 1864-3.10 p. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

Should your demonstration carry you to the West Point railroad break it, and let that seem to be partially the object of the movement, and also it will prevent an infantry force from being thrown down to-night to interfere with General Kilpatrick's return.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.
