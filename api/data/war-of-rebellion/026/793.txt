General GUSTAVUS W. SMITH,

Commanding Army, &amp;c., Richmond, Va.:

DEAR SIR: I sent you a copy of my letter to General J. G. Foster, U. S. Army; inclosed you have his reply.* You will perceive he conveniently disavows that the acts were done with his knowledge and consent. I cannot well go behind that, and unless instructed otherwise by Saturday next shall reply without further reference.

Yours, very truly,

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I have not yet received the affidavits sent you of the outrage in Craven County on women. Send it as soon as possible. I forwarded them to you.
