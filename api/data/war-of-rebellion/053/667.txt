several wagon trains in sight motionless. One column of infantry, apparently two brigades, moved across some fields an hour ago, going toward Snow Hill.

Very respectfully,

WILL T. MARTIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

GLASS' MILL, [September 18, 1863]- 1 p.m.

General POLK,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: I have driven the enemy's pickets across the creek. Citizens report no movement near here last night. There is an excellent position for another corps on your left. Its right resting a little below this place and its left toward Pigeon Ridge, its right would be immediately on the creek.

I have just captured a prisoner of Palmer's corps, who states that Thomas' division moved into camp on their right late last night. The main camp seems to be about opposite Owens' Ford, which is now nearly on my left. Were General Hill to take position where I have mentioned his center would cover it.

Respectfully,

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.

GLASS' MILL, [September 18, 1863] - 1.30 p.m.

General POLK:

GENERAL: From all information I can obtain, the larger portion of the enemy's force is above your left, on Chickamauga. This prisoner, just taken, says their men were much scattered, and not expecting any advance. I fired a shot into their encampment before they knew of my approach.

My cavalry is now massing on your left, and as soon as General Hill forms on your left I will form in rear of your left wing.

Respectfully,

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,[September 18, 1863]- 5 p.m.

General POLK,

Commanding:

GENERAL: A brigade of my division has been ordered to go on General Hill's left by General Hill since I left him. General Wheeler is immediately in rear of General H.'s left, and has orders from General Bragg to protect the left flank of the army. My brigade is not needed there whilst one of Wheeler's divisions is lying 1 mile west of Anderson's doing nothing. I have a brigade now on General Hill's left, protecting Worthen's Gap and Owens' and Glass' Fords. This should be done by General Wharton if I am to move with your corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.
