HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,Augusta, Ga., February 20, 1865.

Brigadier-General FRY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Augusta:

GENERAL: A pontoon bridge has been ordered to be built over the Savannah River between Washington, Ga., and Abbeville, S. C. A guard is necessary at that point to protect it and also to arrest stragglers and deserters from the armies in South Carolina and Virignia. General Beauregard desires that you will relieve from duty the guard and officers ordered to report to you a few days since and direct them to proceed by the best practicable route to that point for the purpose above indicated. They should move with three days' cooked rations. The guard can in future be subsisted from Washington or Abbeville.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, &c.,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WHITE OAK, February 20, 1865.

General Beauregard recommends that the ordnance stores be removed from Charlotte as soon as possible. Major Trezevant left Ridgeville [Ridgeway] for Charlotte on 18th. He can give you more explicit information as to the ordnance shipped from Columbia. Every possible assistance was rendered.

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,Near White Oak, S. C., February 20, 1865.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding Lee's Corps:

GENERAL: General Beauregard directs that you move with your command by the shortest and best route to Landsford ford, thence to Charlotte, via Belair and Pleasant Valley. You will await further orders at Charlotte. Unless otherwise pressed you will move at the rate of about twenty miles a day. He will move along the railroad, so as to be in telegraphic communication with General Hampton and the War Department. He will probably pass the night at Chesterville, and to-morrow night at or about the railroad bridge on the Catawba. General Hampton has been instructed to give orders to his trains whether to accompany yours or remain under his protection.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. R. CHISOLM,

Aide-de-Camp.
