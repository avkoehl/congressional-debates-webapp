Reports state enemy's wagon train stalled beyond here in that direction. By energetic movement your brigade may make important captures. Though not intended to bring on an engagement, the force should, if possible, convey to the enemy an impression of pursuit. Let the commanding officer report promptly and frequently to these headquarters what is passing in front, and remain out until further orders. Let them move promptly.
