PADUCAH, KY., April 12, 1864.

Captain A. M. PENNOCK:

The rebels are in force around us. The colonel and the gun-boats are waiting for an attack. I can hardly believe that they will make the effort to take the place with four gun-boats. We do not allow any transports to go down the river, nor will we until we can give convoy. The Peosta, Moose, Brilliant, and Fair Play are here. The Key West went up the river this morning with an army convoy. The Silver Lake is patrolling the river below.

Beware of rebel strategy and lookout for Cairo and Columbus. I think the rebels want to cross the Ohio.

JAMES W. SHIRK,

Lieutenant-Commander, Commanding Seventh District.

PADUCAH, KY., April 12, 1864.

General BRAYMAN:

A confidential messenger just in reports the enemy in heavy force this side Lovelaceville, coming this way.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the day has passed quietly. A report was brought in that Forrest, 20,000 strong, was at Mayfield last night. I have the news from my scouts, who will not return until they have positive information.
