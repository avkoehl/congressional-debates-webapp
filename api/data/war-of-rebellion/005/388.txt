payment. I was informed by various gentlemen of standing that had my troops been the first among them the feeling towards the Union would have been greatly strengthened, but that the carrying away of slaves and horses and the destruction of private property by a command under a Colonel Dwight, of Sickles' brigade, had alienated many and driven others across the Potomac, who otherwise would have remained at home. Complaints of this command were universal. This brigade behaved better than I expected, and marched exceedingly well. In their bivouacs they were exposed to a great deal of rain, and for infantry the roads were worse than I have ever seen. General Howard communicated with me from Lower Marlborough.

Not deeming it important, I gave General Hooker no notice of my position in his rear.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. SYKES,

Brigadier-General Volunteers, Commanding Brigade.

Captain H. W. SMITH,

Volunteer Service, Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully submitted to the Commanding General. The endeavor of Brigadier-General Sykes to conciliate the feelings of the inhabitants is commended by me. Officers and men of the brigade conducted themselves with propriety.
