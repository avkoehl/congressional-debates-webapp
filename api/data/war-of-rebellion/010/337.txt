ready and willing to meet the enemy. The scouts returning all report the enemy in full retreat for Corinth. There is now time to look over the field and witness the destruction-the dead, wounded, and dying, cannon dismounted, arms scattered, horses killed, &amp;c.

The loss of the Tenth Brigade is as follows:

Killed .................................................... 14

Wounded ................................................... 106

Missing ................................................... 4

Total* .................................................... 124

Each brigade is to bury all the dead on the ground over which it marched. The Tenth has been at work, and buried 112 of the enemy that fell in our front. They took their wounded off the field, except the prisoners we captured.

HDQRS. THIRTY-SIXTH REGIMENT INDIANA VOLUNTEERS, Near Pittsburg Landing, Tenn., April 8, 1862.

SIR: In discharge of my duty I make the following report of the part the Thirty-sixth Indiana Volunteers took in the general engagement at this place on the evening of the 6th and day of the 7th instant:

On our march from Savannah on the 6th my regiment had the advance of the column, and four companies forward as an advance guard, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Carey, leaving four under my command at the head of the column (two companies having been left behind on other duty).

I there lost another man killed and on wounded.

During the forepart of the night with the brigade we took an advanced position of about 200 yards, and took our position on the left of the brigade, and extreme left of the line of battle, which seemed to have been formed during the night, and lay on our arms until 5.30 o'clock the next morning, when we were ordered and moved forward with the brigade in line of battle. With two companies thrown forward and to the left as skirmishers we advanced forward to the left of the Corinth road about one-half mile, when our skirmishers engaged the enemy, we advancing steadily and the enemy falling back for a distance of about 2 miles from where we lay in the morning, when the engagement became general in strong force on both sides. Seeing the enemy making continuous efforts to turn our left, I threw out, by your order, a third company as skirmishers, which, with the assistance of
