Memphis, Tenn.:

Paragraph 3, General Orders, No. 21, current series, War Department, defines the status of the troops of the District of West Tennessee stationed at Memphis, or any other point on the east bank of the Mississippi. General Canby has the authority, you will see, to give your orders in certain contingencies, but no other general officer has, except myself, Lieutenant-General Grant, General Sherman, who is still in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi, and the Secretary of War, and Major-General Halleck, chief of staff, U. S. Armies. I am not informed by General Halleck what troops would be left in Memphis subject to your orders. You had better telegraph him exact state of affairs, being better informed on that than I am, and ask for information of what troops were to be left. General instructions for your guidance will be forwarded you by mail.
