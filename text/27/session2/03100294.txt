that which waspassed, but thatwhich was to come? If this bill
«hould-not become a law, what would be the only consequence?
Simply, thatA B when he had a deposite to make, or any other
banking: business to transact, would go to the cashier of the
bank, in the bank itse'f, and make hia deposite, or transact his
business with him as an Individual, and not as cashier, and the
Jaw was at once evaded A, most ingenious expedient, truly '
The Senator, from Delaware had said, in sut stance, m behalf of
these banks, "we art1 deter mi ned to violate your law, but we
would rather not To save ouiseives from this, necessity, we
•wish you to pass the pi esent bill " Asif a man were ¿o come
■forward and inform you that ho had deteimined to commit a
crime against law, and that you must therefore repeal the law,
in order to save his conscience It v\ as reserved for the banks
to discover this ingenious argument
He(M? Buchanan) yet trusted, although he knew it was
hoping against hope, that the "-enate might not lend its sanction
to such a bill Tor his own part, he was prepaied to come up
boldly to the work as a paity man, and rwe or fall m sustaining
the principles of his party The day of miserable expedients
had passed away, he tius«,ed forever Let us carry out the
principle* we have always profebsed M us forte a resump
lion wherever we have the power, and leave the results to the
country
As to the State of Ohio, which had so gloriously a seited its
independence of bank dictation and bank seduction, we had
been informed by one of her Senators, [Mr Allen] all thing*,
had moved smoothly along since the resumption bill had be
come a law Indeed, the banks had widely ant*cipated us ope
ration Hebehevefl that withm the spare of sixty fhys after
the resumption of the banks in anv State, the people would
wonder how they could ever have been de uded by the svien
songthatresumption wouldbe ruinous, to then interests As
soon as confidence was restored, the vast amount of specie
which had been hoarded everywhere by cautious and prudent
people would again make nsappearance and thus the banks
themselves would be sustained
In what he had said, and it was not his intention to add any
thing more, he did not wish to be understood as casting any im
putauon upon the puvate character of any of the bankers m
this District Far from it A system of bank morality seemed
to be established every where throughout the country, which
if applied to individuals, these bankers themselves would loudly
condemn It was the nature ol the calling racther than the na
ture of the man which made self interest the pole star of the
conduct of the bankers In reeard to the President of the
Bank of the Metropolis, he would say that he had known him
long and knownhun well,and he believed him to be as sound in
his principles of pnvate conductas he was correct m his de
porimeut of a gentleman of the old school
i le hoped that all his political friends, by their votes and by
their voices, would sustain the cause of immediate lesumption
The Whigs would be only acting upon their | unciples in votin*
for continued Euspension Let us make up the issue between
the two puties ind leave the re ult to the country
Mr VVOODURIUGC said a few words m relation to the
bank curiency of the ¡state of Michigan, and the led back cur

Mr WR GHTmadea few remarks in reply expla mng the
source of his information as to what he had stated of the cur

Hi BAYARD entered into an elaborate explanation of the
circumstances under which the banks of this D strict required
the passage of this bill He had no objection to an amendment
which might be introduced as an additional piuviso, to the ef
feet that a;> soon as the banks of Maryland and Virginia should

PennsvWania is to his advocacy some days ago ofsound doc
trines on the -ml ject ot b inking he would say that his opinions
and principles were unrhin^ul and when the geneial subject
should come up, it would be found he had not changed What
he had advocated with itj mi to tins bill, was m consequence of
his belief that cncmnstarjces overrule ceneial principles and
authonze 'exceptions He next contested the ciu urn tánces
governing the otau. of Oh o, and those g verning this D sti ct
with a view of showing that the difft trice w i^stf "reatadlo
1'isify a different polity He compared the condition of the
District to that of a ttamster who&e 'larness wUb brokt-n in the
midst of his journey i id the question was whether he would
remain in that helpless pre hcament, or go to woik and natth
up his haine«8in the best way he could m view ofieachm 
the end of his journey as speedily as possible                             3
He further reviewed tht chatters of the innk-, and the arts
for the extension fr it tune to time and lenhed 10 some nomts
of arguments made by the S^mtor fiom Ohio yesterday con
t  ml ng that the refusal of Congiet* to, pas^ this act would
drive the (ommnmtyheie into the handaofhrokersand shivers
lie c unmerited upon the Sena or's declaiation that these banks
hid plundeied the community, maintaining that it wss only the
Senator's vehemence which had forced him into a belief that
had no grounds to rtst upon He contended that the comn n
nity of this District wete obliged from the necessity of the case
to receive and my out thia niedeemable cmrency, and undei
their restrmgenturcumstanres they weie glad tog tthosecer
tincares of deporte He mamt uned that he had already shown
there was no violation of law in this form ot ceiiifictte
It seemed to him that, as a tempoiary matter, there oueht
to be no objection to this bill He never would have consented
to sustain this bill had he not been satisfied that the peculiai
cir<~ una aocts of this Di&tnct demanded its pa^a^e At
a suitable time he «hmtll he prepared to puibue the^proner
course in relation to a sound system of currency
Mr WOODBURY said that he would detain the Senate but
a few moments
The motion to commit had hardly been argued at all yet it
was firct m order and was made bv a mem her of this body to
inquire loto ttgii ve cjuif laint of misconduct by a l>ai k i^kmo-
of us a favor TJndei such circumstance* befjie acting on the
petition for inlulsrence shoulI we not first a«reitam whether
the party had violated mn f)rmer legislation' let us have
light and certainty as to this in rhe outsei It s-, due to the cha
meter of the bank *vei!aa u irselvts, the °- ¡ardían of tht*
community
Butgoingtoth mentsofthe bill, if seem  to me that ail he
aiguments in favor of us provisions have bet dr&weied ex
cept one I shall, therefore confine my sdf to that one ' aji
agree, on both sides of this chamber, it i-  hoped that a currency
of specie, or the notes of specie paying banks is to be 1 referred
to one discredited and notredeemable in specie
This is too plain to need further facts or reasoning    In the
next place, it is certain that, though banks like these are re
quired to redeem then own notes in specie, it is not sufficient to
ensure a sound currency, unless you further require that these
banks shall not receive 'or pay out irredeemable notes of other
banks For otherwise those irredeemable notes, eo 1 ecei ved and
paid out, will constitute the currency This is the result of all
our experience It is virtually admitted by the chairman TMr
I3AYAKD ] Hence this new bill seems to be proposed in order
to relieve these banks from that restriction and to permit them
to take and circulate notes discredited and below par He ad
nuts, if I understand him, that this relief is not right in the ab
stract but contends it is proper and necessary under all the pai
ticular circumstances of the present case This is the position
on which I differ from him, and this alone I shall attempt m a
very few words to combat
Every year since the general suspension of specie pay
men's in 1837, numerous facts have proved that one State can
resume, though another does not One county or district can
resume, though another does not One city, or one bank in one
citv though others do not This District is small m territory
But its population equals half that of some whole States The
idea that we mist wait for all adjoining is an argument foi an
eternal suspension
All our expenence duung ÍS3S and 1839, as well as 1837,
demonstrates that eveiy fctafe, District, city or bank can
íesume whenever it is sound, without wai ing foi the
lest It is its duty to do tl is, and it is 0111 duty to require
this of all tho e undei our legislative caie But how is
theory and politicil science, on this, as wtli as expedente"?
It is not wnat laws the youthful giant Onio can impose—
nor what Virginia or Maryland dicta es ISo sir It is what
the gieat laws of trale and of the currencv piescnbe on this
They show every wheie and at all time", that specie ¡roes
where it is, wanted or demanded, and can te had to resume if
only asked for It quits those who do no wish it 1 his is the
case with ind vi iualsas well communities The man who asks
for «pecio or its equivalent under his constitutional light", oh
tarns it So does the bank 01 people who demand it, or the
Constitution itself becomes a nullity
But it is asked where can the specie be had"? It comes, sir,
as any othei commodity, to every place wheie it is requested,
or where there is a market for it Its movements exhibit the
old operations of supply and demand all the world over There
is an ample amount in the country and m the world If one < uy
prefers to eat wheat lather than oats—the wheat comes and the
oats disappeai, and go to places which aie still content with
oats But, say gentlemen, our money here comes fiom the
Government, and the Government now pays m a depreciated
paper Gianted, if you please, foi this-aigument Yet thede
preciation is small, though none should be requued to lose that
This 13 the root of a?y real evil now, which the community u
self cannot at once entirely remove Tormeily, thousands on
thousands of dol aisin speeie were brought heie by the irea
surv and paid out to public cieditirs as duty required It was
often obtained in exchange lor Tieasury notes It should be
now if not otheiwise pto"uiable The Iieasuiy should bear
the 103s! it any, and not the community If specie, then, or its
equivalent, is not paid out here now hythe Government, it ought
to be We should see to this We should look to the con
duct of the Treasury as well as of the banks And if our own
payments here, by our own agent , are not made m conformity
to law and theCorstuution- if the District and the Government
aie thereby disgiacedoi discredited, where is the fault? It lies,
sir at the dooisoi Congress
Mi CALHOUN" said if he nad no other reason for voting m
fivoi of theamcndmeiU and against the bul, mease the amend
mtttshmUl ful, ítwis buffiuent for him to know that the
banks had been acting for some time pa&t in dnect violation of
law This fact furnished to hi* mind an ample reason why tf p
bill ought nor to pass He did not intend to examine either of
the acts which had been heretofore parsed in behalf of th'1
bank- , imther than to ascerla n that which was perfectly man
ifestupm theveiy face of this act itself, that it had heen the
intent on of Congrebs that alttr the fir t day of March, 18-12,
tbeieshould bean en 1 to the circulation of all other descrip
tions ofcurrency within UiHÜi^tiict, than eold and siher 01
the tintes of specie paying banks Congress m his opinion
should caust its law=s to beicspcctedand obeyed ard whenever
a violation ofalaw occuned and they failed to visit the ofílnd
ei-- with some to\t of punishment they would deoerve ss in
thib case that ms-ilt t-houtd be added to din bed] en ce But
there weie 0 hei and powerful reasons why the bi'l ehouid
not pass In the eaily | enod of bank suspensions, m the yeai
1837, it had been his opinion that the banks fhould
have time allowed them, bi t that the Legislature
fahould take care so to frame their legislation as to
prevent a recurienceof suspension It was the onlv remedy
and he firmly belu*vt.d now that if ¡.hat course had been adopted
in 1837, the «mspenstion of 1838 and 1839 would not have oc
cuired and the greater part of the evils which had arisen from
bank suspensions would have been avoided, for he held that
the country had suffered far more from the subsequent than
from the first suspension Their latter acts had done more to
wards the overthtow of the banks and the derangement of the
the currr cy than any other circumstance whatever But
theie was now no leason on eaith why suspension should be
continue i on the partofjthese banks It was an evil to the
community and an evil to the banks themselves if he wished
to destroy the banks he would say, go on, grant them the puvj
lege they a^k and the probability was they never would le
piime, for they would put it out of their own power to do so
In his opinion no fuithei indulgence ought t© be gianted to
them, the only effect of which would be to make them still
worse than they wete at present, and to inflict additional inmry
upon the community, and if these observations wei e true as
iegard-5 banking opeiation^ elsewhere, they were eminently
ttue in reference to hese banks of the Dis'nct of Columbia
wheie Gongte^ ought as the immediate guardians of the pub
lie interest, to set an example, and enforce immediate jesumn
tion                                                                                              f
But there was anothei and sull moie powerful reason why
he bill should not pa«s                                                                y
The popu a ion of the District, as had been irgued was
coir po e! of consumers chiefly, whose staple commodity of
exchange for the articles of consumption, consists of j¡n]d an 1

reived bv them m payment of then salaries from the Govern
men , and the only motive which he could íenagmeasmfluenc
mg tne banks m endeavoring to establish a local currency dif
fen ¡x from this standard, was one in the highest degree dis
ci editable to them                                                            °
He would not prolong the discussion The commotions
which had been produced throughout the whole Union by the
operation of anlc suspensions, should be a sufficient warning
The gleat comn erual cities, ÜNew Orleans, Philadelphia, New
York, had been successively convulsed by their banks They
weie now beginning to experiei ce a return to a more sound
condition in consequence ol having taken a more deteimmed
stand The neighboring city of Baltimore bad recently expe-
rienced the shock, and it was time that they, who weie espe
tia!)y íesponsible in this matter, should at once take a decided
stand, and he would s.ay to the gentlemen opposite, that a feel
ing of compassion towards the bank5? themselves as well as of
humanity towards the mjuied community, should prou pt
them to exeicise ,adue severity mth s instance, in ordei that if
it were possible yet to rescue them fiom complete destruction,
the opportunity might not be lost The longer it was delayed,
the woise would be the evil and the moredifficult the remedy
