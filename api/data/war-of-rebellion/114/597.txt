Captain BRAGG,

Second Regiment Maryland Volunteers.

SIR: I do not wish any searches made in private dwellings by the military. I prefer it should be done by the police. You have very properly reported tome the case of Doctor Henkle and I shall put it in the hands of the provost-marshal in Baltimore. I do not wish any persons to be stopped who have shotguns and who are evidently going on sporting excursions. They should not be dtained or interfered with in any way. Your duty is to examine vihicles passing out of the city of Baltimore and suspected of having concealed arms or goods destinated to the disloayl States.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.
