UNITED STATES STEAMER BENTON, Off Island Numbers 10, April 3, 1862.

GENERAL: This morning the Benton, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg, with three mortar boats, opened and continued for more than an hour a fire on the rebels' heavy floating battery at Island Numbers 10, when the battery, having received several shells from the rifles and mortars, cut loose from her moorings and drifted 2 or 3 miles down the river. The shells were thrown from the flotilla on different parts of the island and into the rebel batteries lining the Tennessee shore. The return fire produced no effect upon the squadron. No more men than were actually necessary to man the rebel batteries were visible.

I ma, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. FOOTE,

Flag-Officer.

FLAG-STEAMER BENTON, Off Island No, April 6, 1862.

GENERAL: I inclose several papers in relation to our operations here. I have written Commodore Porter that, in consideration of my having authority to modify the Eastport, now preparing for a gunboat at Mound City, into a ram, and the two boats you refer to as being built also for that purpose, he had better not attempt to fit out the steamer Choctaw, at Saint's Louis, as he proposes, into a ram, but to confine himself to fitting out and getting the Essex ready to join us as soon as possible. If under your authority you wish Commodore Porter to fit out the Choctaw, he will of course do it under your directions. I have no authority to act in the matter except what may be authorized and directed by you.

As you will perceive by the accompanying papers, there is so much hazard in running the blockade with our badly-protected gunboats, and the rebels being so much on the alert, I consider it injudicious to hazard another boat in attempting to reach New Madrid.

I am not yet informed of the condition of the Carondelet.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. FOOTE,

Flag-Officer.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Commanding Army of the West, Saint Louis, Mo.
