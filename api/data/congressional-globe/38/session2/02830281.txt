Mr. ASHLEY. The select committee on the
rebellious States direct me to ask of the House
that this amendment may be substituted for the
original bill, and considered as an original bill, to
which other substitutes may be submitted as
amendments.
The SPEAKER. That can be done only by
unanimous consent.
There being no objection, it was so ordered.
Mr. KELLEY. 1 move to amend this bill by
inserting jifter the words " to enroll all the white
male citizens of the United States,99 the words
"and all other male citizens of the United States
who may be able to read the Constitution thereof."
Mr. ELIOT. I move the following as a sub-
stitute:
Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:
That the States declared to he in rebellion against the
United States, and within which the authority of the Con-
stitution atid laws of the United States lias been over-
thiown, shall not be permitted to resume their political
relations with the Government of the United States until,
by action of the loyal citizens within such States respect-

organized a just local government, republican iu form, and

Congiess.
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. Ts the motion of
the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Wilson] in order
under the rule ?
The SPEAKER. It is, for it is in the nature
of an amendment to an amendment. By unani-
mous consent the House has substituted the
amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Ashley] in the place of the original bill re-
; ported trom the select committee on the rebel-
lious States. The gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr. Eliot] submits an amendment to that bill,
in the nature of a substitute. The gentleman from
Iowa [Mr. Wilson] moves an amendment to the
amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Eliot.] The gentleman from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Kelley] has also submitted an amendment
to the seventh section of what is now the original
bill, and as his amendment is to perfect the ori-
ginal bill, the fii st question will be upon the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Kelley.]

ment m the nature of a substitute.

lows: ,

recommit this bill, with all the pending amend-
ments; and as I do not desire todiscuss the sub-
ject now, 1 will yield the floor to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kelley.]
Mr. KELLEY. Mr. Speaker, theseare indeed
terrible times for timid people. Use and wont no
longer serve us. The guns traitorously fired upon
Port Sumter threw us all out of the well-beaten ruts
of habit, and as the war progresses men find them-
selves less and less able to express their political
views by naming a party or uttering its shibbo-
leth. It is no longer safe for any of us to wait till
the election comes and accept the platform and
tickets presented by a party. We may have
served in its ranksfor alife-time and find atlastâ
costly and painful experience being our guideâ
that to obtain the ends we had in view we should
have acted independently of,and in opposition to
it and its leaders. In seasons like this,an age on
ages telling, the feeblest man in whom there is faith
or honesty is made to feel that he is not quite
powerless, that duty is laid on him too, and that
the force that is in him ought to be expressed in
accordance with his own convictions and in a way
to promote some end seen or hoped for.
The questions with which we have to deal, the
grave doubts lhatconfound us, the difficulties that
environ us, the results our action will produce,
fraught with weal or woe to centuries and con-
stantly-increasing mill ions,are such as have rarely
been confided to a generation. But happily we
â¢are not without guidance. Our situation, though
novel, does not necessarily cast us upon the field
of mere experiment. True, we have not specific
precedents which we may safely follow; but the
founders of our Government gave us, in a few
brief sentences, laws by which we may extricate
our generation and country from the horrors that
involve them,and secure peace broad as our coun-
try, enduiing as its history, and bcncficent as
right and justice and love.
The organized war power of the rebellion is on
the eve of overthrow. Itbelongsto us to.govem
the territory we have conquered, and the question
of reconstruction presses itself upon our atten-
tion; and ourlegislation in this behalf will, though
it comprise no specific provisions on the subject,
determine whether guerrilla war shall harass
communities for long years, or be suppressed m
a brief time by punishments administered through
courts and law, to marauders for the crimes tliey
may commit under the name of partisan warfare.
At the close of an international war, the wronged
but victorious party may justly make two claims:
indemnity for the past, and secuuty for the fu-
ture; indemnity for the past in money or in ter-
ritory; security for the future by new treaties, the
establishment of new boundaries, or the cession
of military power and the territory upon which
it dwells. Indemnity for the past we cannot
hope to obtain. When we shall have punished
the conspirators who involved the country in tins
sanguinary war, and pardoned the dupes and vic-
tims who have arrayed themselves or been forced
to do battle under their Hag, we shall but have re-
possessed our ancient territory, reestablished the
boundaries of our country, restored to our flag
and Constitution their supremacy over teiritory
which was ours, but which the insurgents meant
to dismember and possess. The other demand
wo may and must successfully make. Security
for the future is accessible to us, and we must
demand it; and to obtain it with amplest guaran-
tees requires the adoption of no new idea, the
making of no experiment, the entering upon no
sea of political speculation. Ours would have
been an era of peace and prosperity, ha# we and
our fathers accepted in full faith the gieat princi-
ples that impelled their fathers to demand the in-
dependence of the United Colonies, gave them
strength in counsel, patience, courage, and long
endurance in the field, and guided them in estab-
lishing a Constitution which all agos will rccog-
