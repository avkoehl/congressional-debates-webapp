HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,June 15, 1864.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: Under the instructions to relieve General Knipe, my line will be drawn out to a thin (single) line. General Schofield has not yet connected on my right, and I am not sure that he will. The enemy are strong and spiteful in my front. I have no idea of my losses, except 35 ambulance loads, and more waiting. Major Griffin, commanding Nineteenth Michigan, a fine officer, Major Ragan, Seventeenth Indiana, are among the number.

I am hard at work intrenching close to the enemy. If my line could be shortened by Geary coming a little to the right, I should like it. I do not like to be extended in one line without a reserve.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

With this line we shall have to rely on Schofield's position on our right to cover our trains. He tells me that he does to perfectly.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,June 15, 1864 - sundown, 7 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: Owing to the distance of my two brigades from [each other?] the leading one was quite a little while in getting in. Have run against a strong line of works with artillery supported by infantry. Shall hold the position I have gotten until dark and then intrench. The Twenty-third Corps should be ordered forward on my right. The position is of such strength that I cannot carry it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
