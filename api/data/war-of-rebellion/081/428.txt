BERMUDA HUNDRED, June 25, 1864. [Received 4.25 p.m.]

Lieutenant-Colonel BOWEN,

General Smith's Headquarters:

If you will direct the Rhode Island battery to report to Brooks I will send you the Fourth Wisconsin.

GEO. A. KENSEL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864-5.20 p.m.

Colonel SHAFFER:

I understand that my pickets are not to be relieved. If so, I would ask that you send me the men I left, and I will replace them by two regiments. Now, those men are taken from the several regiments and it breaks up my organization.

Respectfully,JNO. W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Send regiments and I will send men.

J. W. SHAFFER.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 25, 1864.

General TURNER,Commanding Division:

General Smith desires me to say to you that the chief engineer of the corps, Captain Farquhar, reports the enemy's lines so well covered by traverses, &c., that he has determined to postpone the assault indefinitely. The loss of life would probably not be proportioned to the results gained. You will therefore please countermand your orders for the assault at 7.30 p.m. to-day.

Respectfully, &c.,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 25, 1864.

Brigadier General J. W. TURNER,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General Smith desires me to say that he wishes you to strengthen the salient on your front to-night, and protect it by strong abatis in front. The flanks will also have to be strongly connected with the main lines. If possible the general commanding would like you to push out little zigzags from under the parapets for skirmishers and sharpshooters, covering the extremities by slight traverses, which may finally be connected so as to form a parallel. The mortar battery should be particularly well protected. Respectfully, &c.,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
