of slavery produces ail iiuquaiUy of States.
The principle of allowing parts of a nation
political power in proportion to the number of
men tliey hold in bondage, is so undemocratic
and detrimental to liberty that 1 am surprised that
any man outside of the privileged States should
be willing to extend it one inch beyond the States
to which it already applies. Such a principle as
this would have been repudiated by the heathen
democracy of Alliens long centuries ago.
By the Constitution of the United States, in the
apportionment of Representatives to Congress,
five slaves count the same as three freemen. Under
tliis provision of the Constitution, from 1789 to
IT92 the South gained seven Representatives;
from 1795 to 1813 she gained fourteen; from 1813
to 1823 she gained nineteen; from 1K23 to 1833
the gain was twenty-two; from 1833 to 1843 the
gain was twenty-five. At this moment the South
has twenty additional members on this floor on
account of this principle.
The present ratio of representation is 93,731.
The free States have 144, and the slave States 90
Representatives. The free white population of
the free States, in 1850, was 13,438,667; and the
free white population of the slave States was
6,184,404. The number of free colored persons
in the free States is about equal to the same class
in the slave States. The free States have 144
Representatives on this floor, or, on an average,
one Representative for 93,324 free white inhabit-
ants. Tbe slave States have 90 Representatives,
or, on an average, one Representative for 68,715
free white inhabitants. This is the way this prin-
ciple works.
in the next presidential election the free States
will have 176 electoral votes, or, on an average,
one electoral vote for 76,356 free white inhabit-
ants. The slave States will have 120 electoral
votes, or, on an average, one electoral vote for
51,536 free white iahabitants. - The South will
have 20 electoral votes as a premium for slavery.
If we examine particular States we shall find
the contrast even more unequal than in the aggre-
gate. For instance, South Carolina haa a white
population of 274,567, and six Representatives,
or one representative to 45,761 free white inhab-
itants. She has eight electoral votes, or one for
34,321 white inhabitants. Newt Hampshire has
a white population of 317,456, and three Repre-
sentatives, or one for 105,818 inhabitants. She
has five electoral votes, or one for 63,491 free
white inhabitants. It will be observed from thesis
figures, that three white men in South Carolina
have as much influence in the votes upon this
floor as seven white men in New Hampshire.
And this, sir, is tbe " eqnalih) of the States," so
much talked of on the other side of the House.
Perhaps, sir, the institution of slavery is so
elevating in its effects upon human character, that
three men in South Carolina are equal to seven
in New Hampshire. The country should conr
cider the subject in this light before they pass any
hasty judgment. It certainly has some very
striking examples.
The following statistics of the. third congres-
sional district of New Hampshire, represented
by me, and the district represented by Hon, Law-
rence M. Keitt,of South Carolina, from the cen-
sus of 1850, will illustrate the working; of this
principle,and be found suggestive of ether things:

Georgia has a free white population of 521,572
and eight Representatives, or one for 65,196 white
inhabitants. Maine has a free .white population
of 581,813, (60,000 more than Georgia,) and six
Representatives, or one.for 96,969 inhabitants.
Virginia has a white population of< 894,800, and
thirteen Representatives, or one for 68,830 free
white inhabitants. . Massachusetts has a white
population of 989,450, (about 100,000 more than
Virginia,) and eleven Representatives, or one for
89,586.
But some one will say: "The South pays
direct taxes in the same proportion as an offset
for this property representation." This is true.
Let us examine this point, and see whether the
South lias been the gainer or loser by this provis-
ion. A direct tax has been resorted to only four
times since 1789, by the General Government,
viz: in 1798, 1813, 1814, and 1816, and is not
likely to be resorted to again. The whole amount
assessed was $14,000,000. Of this, the South paid
for her slaves only $1,256,553.
In 1837, the surplus revenue of the Union,
amounting to over $37,000,000, was distributed
among the several States in proportion to- their
electoral votes. By the census of 1830, the North
had 7,008,451 free persons, and the South had
3,823,289. ThefreeStatesreceived $21,410,777 12,
and the slave States $16,058,082 85. Every free
man of the North received but $3 50, while every
free man of the South received $4 20 in that divis-
ion.
At that time the South had one hundred and
twenty-six electoral votes, of which twenty-five
were on account of her slaves. She therefore
received by that arrangement $3,186,127 50, on
account of the representation of her slave prop-
erty. Prom that, if we deduct the $1,256,553
paid by her as a direct tax on account of her
slaves, there is left $1,929,574 50 as the bonus
which the South had received from the Treasury
of the nation on account of the representation of
slaves—southern property represented in Con-
gress. Such has been the practical operation
of this provision of the Constitution. In view of
it* Mr. Pickering once said in Congress: " The
terms are not bad for the South to take." So we
should think. By it the South has had extra
representation in Congress of from ten to twertty
members, and & corresponding extra voice in .all
the affairs.-of Government. In addition to this,
she has received nearly two millions of dollars
out of the national Treasury, in consequence of
this unequal representation—this representation
of southern property.
.But, sir, tnis is in the Constitution, and we
pbide by it. I. have alluded to this subject, not
for the purpose of making war upon the Consti-
tution, but for the purpose of giving a practical
reason why we are opposed to the extension of
slavery. We are opposed to the extension of the
principle of property representatioa,and > espe-
cially to a privileged class. Daaiel Webster once
said; r:
" I have made up my mind, for one, tliat under no cir-
cumstances-will I consent to the" extension of the area of
slavery in tbe United States, or to the further increase of
slave representation in the House of Representatives."
So 1 say, and so say the people of th$. free
States. '
I have gone into a somewhat tedious detail of
figures, to show that the North is the sufferer—
that the people of the free States have reason to
complain of inequality, and not the South. The
South have more than their equal rights. Two
thousand . millions of dollars of southern prop-
erty—so called by the  —-is represented on this
.floor. It has twenty Representatives here, while
not a cent of northern property is represented'.
No man is here .to represent our horses and cat-
tle, our iron, our ships, or our mills; and I thank
God it is so. Freehand independent men, free,
intelligent, and liberal thought* and the interests
of free, educated, and well-paid labor, have their
representatives here from the North. Property
representation is confined to the South. And
yet, sir, we hear southern men talking about
" State equality," as though the South did not
enjoy equal right with.the North. - We are told
that slavery must be extended, in order to secure
and preserve to the South her equal rights.
Thisargument is often presented in a different
shape. We have been told many, times this ses-
sion, that the Territories are common property,
and that the southern man has the same right to
occupy them that the northern man has. All
this we admit. We admit that they are common
property, purchased by the common treasure,
and that men from all sections have an equal right
in them; but we deny that the. prohibition of
slavery in the Territories impairs any man's
right. Gentlemen talk as though they could not
' move into a new Territory without their slaves.
They say that, unless they can take their slave
' property there, and hold and use it as they do in
the States, they are excluded. Not so, sir. As
well might the banker say he was excluded be-
cause he could not take his bank with him into
the Territory. His bank charter is the creature
! | of local law. Slave property is the creature of
| the same law; and neither are property beyond
I the locality governed by said laws. •
But, sir, how stands the account between the
North and • South in relation to the Territories
acquired, and paid for out of the common treas-
ury, since the adoption of the Constitution?
Since that time territory has been purchased or
acquired, out of which Jive slave States have been
formed and only two free States. The free States
have paid more than two thirds the cost of the
acquisitions, and obtained less than one third of
the States. This is what I suppose southern gen-
tlemen call " State equality." These States have
the following extent of territory and represent-
ation in Congress:

■^hese figures show, again, the beauties of,
j] "State equality." But as the present contest
1 relates mainly to the Territory of Kansas, I pro-
: pose to show the "equality'* that has been ob-
; served in the division of the purchase out of
which this territory was formed. In 1803 the
United States purchased of France the territory
; known as.the " Louisiana purchase," and paid
j therefor fifteen millions of dollars—the North pay-
i ing, at least, ten millions as her share. Out of
i this particular territory,thus far, fpur States havq
|:been formed—three slave, and one free, as fol-
i lows: i!

The free States have received one fourth the
number of States, less than one fourth the nuifti
ber of square miles, one fourth the number of
Senators, and one seventh the Representatives.
I call the attention of gentlemen to these figures.
This looks as though the South had been excluded
from the Territories! South of Mason and
Dixon's line this is called "State equality!'1
We are taught a different system of addition in
the free States; but, according to southern calcu-
lations, our arithmetic is all wrong.
Kansas and Nebraska constitute the balance bf
the Louisiana purchase; and if they were made
free States, there would be an equal division
of-this territory between the North and South,
Against this thfr Sbuth'are'• contending. Not
satisfied with three fourths, as the division now
stands, they claim Kansas for slavery. .. And this,
sir, notwithstanding it was. pledged' to freedom,
thirty-six,, years agoy in -consideration for the
admission-of Missouri as a slave State. And
because the North will not tamely submit tp.this;
theyi talk of aggression on the part of the frea
States, and threaten a dissolution of the Union.
The people of the North are not given to
bragging or to threats. They have flther modes
of proving their courage , and patriotism. They
appeal to history. If ever an attempt should bis
made to dissolve the unionof these States, because
slavery is not allowed to spread over, free Terri-
tories, I presume the North will demonstrate not
only (heir love for the Union, but their ability to
maintain and defend it.
The mania of slavery extension has seized the
entire South, and taken possession«f the Demo-
