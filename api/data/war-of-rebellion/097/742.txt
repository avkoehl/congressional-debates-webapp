on General Chapman's camp. General Hancock wishes you to notify General Chapman that there is such a report. No reply has been received yet to the communication sent to Mosby on the 11th, but citizens of Millwood report that he says there is no occasion for the surrender of his party. The general wishes you to send a strong detachment to Millwood to get such information as practicable.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

P. S.-The man who took charge of the letter to Mosby should be seen.

WINCHESTER, April 13, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

The general commanding desires you to be on your guard against Mosby for the next three or four days, paying particular attention to the river line from Point of Rocks, and guarding all exposed points. Mosby has been offered the same terms as were given to the Army of Norther Virginia. If he does not surrender the general will send a force into Loudoun.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

HAPRER'S FERRY, April 13, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

I have information that Mosby is collecting his own men, White's battalion, and all straggling rebels within his reach near Snicker's Gap to make a raid. It is to come off a soon as possible. They say it is designed against the cavalry camp near Berryville, but as they speak of that point it may be designed for some other. I think the information sufficiently direct to advise you of it.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, April 13, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

I have received information, I think reliable, that Major White, commanding White's battalion, Mosby's command, died near Purcellville a few days ago of fever.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
