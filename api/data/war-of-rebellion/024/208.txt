W. F. Wheeler, aides-de-camp, I am again under great obligations. All that was required of them they performed with the highest bravery and promptness. They rallied great numbers of fugitives of Davies' division and left led them back to the field.

Surg. J. H. Murphy, acting medical director, was prompt and unwearying, in his care of the wounded. No one could have done more or have done it better.

Reports of all subordinate commanders are herewith transmitted, to which I beg earnest attention, as showing in detail the operations of each command during both days, and in naming those subordinates, both officers and men, whose bravery was conspicuous, but whose names cannot be condensed in this report.

A list of casualties* in full accompanies this, together with a supplementary report of minor operations during the battle, as also of the pursuit.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.
