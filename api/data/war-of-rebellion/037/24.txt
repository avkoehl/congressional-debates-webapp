pickets, we halted, and after a short reconnaissance resumed the advance, and proceeded about 1 1/2 miles farther on said road, where found the enemy in force. My regiment took position on the right of said road, first throwing Companies A, F. and D forward as skirmishers, and afterward the remainder of the regiment moved forward, and, driving the enemy's skirmishers from their position, the regiment was ordered by General Garrard to fall back and resume its original position in line of battle. Sending forward Company G as picket, remained in position until-o'clock, when I was ordered with my regiment to advance with the brigade, and engaged the enemy, and after a short and very severe engagement, was ordered to fall back a short distance, and were not engaged any more during the day, as the enemy commenced a precipitate retreat to Black River Bridge.

On the evening of the 16 the, we proceeded to Edwards Depot, where we halted for the night (having followed in rear of General Benton's brigade). Before leaving Champion's Hill for Edwards Depot, and I was ordered not to get my regiment into line, from the fact that General Garrard had received orders to follow in the rear of General Benton's brigade. I geared the order delivered to General Garrard, and think it was by one of General McClernand's aides.

On the morning of the 17th May, 1863, we resumed the pursuit to near Black River Bridge; took position on the left of the brigade. I then sent Companies A and B forward as skirmishers, and advanced upon the enemy's right, where they were strongly intrenched. My regiment was on the extreme left of the First Brigade, and advanced over an extensive open plain for nearly 1 mile. This plain is intercepted by a slough, which is about opposition. The intrenchments about 150 yards to the left of the enemy's artillery, without opposition. The intrenchments are located below and near Black River Bridge, running nearly north and south.

The loss of my regiment in the actions of Champion's Hill and Black River Bridge is as follows:
