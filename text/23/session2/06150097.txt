Mr HUBBARD remaiked that the oiation
was now under the control of the House It had
been considered by the joint committee that it
would be most propel for each House to act in
dependently in regard to having it punted, mas
much as there was no punter to Confess He
asked leave to piesent the following icsolution
Whereas it was resolved at the last session of
Congiess that John Q, Adws be ítquestéd to
deliver an oration on the life and character of
Geireral La Payette, before the two Houses of
Congi < ss and in pursuance of that i esolution and
sundry other resolutions which have been subse
quently adopted, Mr Adams, on Wednesday,
the 31st day of December, 1834, in the Hall of
the House of Repiesentatives, and in the pres
ence of both Housesof Congiess, and also in the
presence of the President of the United States and
the heads of the respecuve Depaitments of the
General Government, and of a most numerous as-
sembly ot citizens, did deliver an oiation, replete
with those pure and patriotic sentiments which
will be saciedly cherished by eveiy tiue and en
lightened American The House of Repiesent
atives was satisfied with the mannei in which
Mi Adams has' performed the duty assigned
him, and desirous of communicating, " through
the medium of the press," those principles which
have been by him so ably discussed, as well as
their sentiments of respect for the distinguished
character, and then sentiments of giautude for
the devoted services of La Fayette, which have
been by him on this occasion so faithfully ex-
pressed, have come to the following resolution

the blank in the resolution with 10,000 copies

named 50,000, and Mr MILLER 40,000

ber, and earned—yeas 80, nays 61
Mi EVANS, of Maine, suggested that the
oration ought to be punted on better paDer, and
with more neatness, than the ordinary documents
which were oidered by the House He therefore
moved to amend the iesolution,by dnecting that
the printing should bo executed under the dnec-
tion of the committee appointed by the House.

tion, as amended, was then agreed to
