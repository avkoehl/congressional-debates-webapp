1848.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

plainer than that the sum which is shown by these
figures is the true balance to be provided for.
i am aware that some gentlemen (and the Sec-
retary seems to be of that number) have some idea
that the power to reissue these treasury notes
places in some way increased means in the power
of the Government; and that this thirty-three mil-
lions may become fifty millions, or some other
indefinite amount. Nothing in the world can be
more erroneous, not to say absurd,than this view,
as a moment's consideration will show. The acts
of July, 1846-, and January. 1847, which authorized
the issue of treasury notes or a loan, expressly
limit the gross amount to the sum of $33,000,000.
If a loan had been effected the day after the pass-
ing of these acts for the whole amount, no one
disputes that nothing further could be realized. I
The authority given by the acts would be thus !
•exhausted. Would not this have given the Gov- (
ernment all that they can in any way receivc from j
these two loans ? If the price wns the same, would !
not the Secretary of the Treasury have preferred j
to issue stock instead of treasury notes? It will j
also be agreed, that if the notes were issued on two j
years' time, and not redeemable under that time, j
when the money was received into the treasury on
the whole of these notes, nothing further would
remain to be received from that source.
Now, sir, the question is, whether the receiving
these treasury notes at the custom-houses and land
offices instead of gold and silver, in any way in-
creases the available amount of this loan. It most
clearly does not. When they are so received, they
are received in the place of gold and silver, which
would otherwise go into the treasury; and after
they are received, the very best thing which can
be done with them is to negotiate them the very
next day for the very gold and silver which would
•otherwise have been received from the payer of
•duties. These treasury notes are, so far as pay-
ment of duties, &c., is conccrned, a kind of Gov-
ernment paper money; and it would be just as
absurd for a bank to suppose that it was a gainer 1
to have the debts due to it paid in its own bills,
instead of being paid in gold and silver, or that
the gold and silver would not be as available to the
bank as its own promises to pay. There are many
■other suggestions on this subject which show the
utter absurdity of supposing tliatform of paying the
bills into the custom-house, instead of specie, at all
increases the available means of the Government.
If there had not apparently been a dense fog
surrounding this subject, a grievous confusion of
ideas which seems to have been one cause of the
successive and almost incredible errors of the
Secretary of the Treasury, 1 should not, most
assuredly, have argued so plain a proposition. If,
however, I am correct thus far, it is not at all ne-
cessary for me to proceed one step further to show j
that there is the mistake to which I have above re- !
ferred, and which will require an increase of the
Joan bill some one and a half millions of dollars.
There have been, however, a succession of
blunders on this subject, in part connected with
the statements I have already made, and growing
•out of them, and in part of a separate and distinct
character, and showing the error t^be far more
serious in amount. It is not, in the view I have
taken of the subject, and in order to arrive at these
results, important that we should be successful in
exposing or correcting these blunders. It may,
however, be very important, and, in view of the
reccnt advertisement of the Secretary for proposals
for five millions of treasury notes, of the utmost
practical interest to expose other and more serious
errors.
The Secretary states the amount of avails of
treasury notes, as I have already shown, during
the year 1846 and the first quarter of 1847, and the
estimate of avails from the same quarter, as follows:
Avails of treasury notes during
year ending30th June,!847, $25,679,199 45
Deduct redemption oftiea*ury
notes during the year  2,361,397 07
 $23,317,802 38
Avails of treasury notes for
quarter ending 1st October,
3£47  $6,915,078 00
Redemption or treasury notes
and interest  2,385,399 63
  4,529,748 37
Estimated avails of treasury notes and loans
for year, as in report  6,265,294 55
34,132.845 30
Deduct from this amount the amount of loan 33,000,000 00
1,132,8-15 30
It thus appears that, according to his own show-
ing, there is a greater amount received from this
loan and estimate for this year, than the whole of
the loan by more than a million of dollars. Per-
ceiving this discrepancy, I applied to the Register
of the Treasury for an explanation of the difficulty.
The result of this he has given me in the following
statement:

DANIEL GRAHAM, Register.
Treasury Department,
Register's Office, January 18, 1848.
This corrected statement of the Register of the
Treasury is, on the face of it, erroneous, to the
extent of $135,244, aiising from the adding of the
sum of $67,622, instead of deducting it. A word
of explanation will make this clear. Table B
shows the avails of treasury notes to have been
for the first quaiter of the present year $6,915,078.
From this amount, in order to show the actual
amount of these notes on hand, should be deducted
the amount which has been returned into the treas-
ury of note* issued in 1846 and 1847. This is
stated in the report to be 2,385,329 63. The Re-
gister, however, states, in his corrected statement,
that a portion of these notes, so stated as having
been redeemed or returned into the treasuiy, were
notes issued under other acts, and for interest paid,
and shouldthusbededucted from theaboveamount
of $2,385,329 63. tie does so deduct the sum of
$142,979 63, and, after having so deducted it, sub-
tracts the amount. This is all right as far as 1t
goes, but the error consists in this: He proceeds
to " deduct also treasury notes, redeemed and
issued under acts prior to acts of 22d July, 1846,
also part of said sum of $2,385,329 63, $67,622."
This is clearly wrong. This amount clearly re-
duced by so much the amount which#wos to be
subtracted, and thus increased instead of diminishing
; the amount of treasury notes to be accounted for
from the sum of $1,401,900 to $1,537,143.
It will be seen that this statement shows the dis-
crepancy to be greater than shown by the report
; of the Secretary, owing to the fact that the pay-
j ment made on account of former loans is deducted.
I The explanation of this discrepancy, and the mode
j in which the accounts are made to balance, is
i shown as follows:
i "Deduct also the amount of treasury notes issued under
acts of 1846 and 1847, winch were m the hand* of the ac-
; counting ofliceis on the /ii&t of October, 1847, and not cov-
i ered by warrant, but winch notes when coveied will make
! the ehaige against the treasury equal to the notes converted
: into stock orrcceived foi public dues $1,401,900."
(I have shown that this sum should be $1,537,-
143.) 1 know not, sir, that I understand this state-
ment. I hope some of the Committee of Ways
and Means, particularly those who are especially
in the confidence of the Executive and the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, will enlighten us in this
matter, which, to my eyes, appears tb be not re-
markable for clearness, however much it may have
been the wish of the officers at the department to
throw light on this subject. Let us, however, look
at this explanation in connection with tableG,from
which the estimated balance, which is to be avail-
able for the year ending July 1,1848, is taken. In
relation to the amount of the actual avails received
from loans and treasury notes during the year
ending June 30, 1817, and the first quarter ending
October 1, 1847, there is no controversy. The
question is as to the amount available during the
residue of the year. The table is as follows:
G.—Amount available on the ht October, 1847, of the loans
of 1846 and 1847,
Of the loan of J846—loan of. ..$10,000,000 00

standing.,  1,255,850 00

It thus appears that, on the 1st October, 1847,
the stock issued on the two loans amounted to
$11,4-35,105 45, and the outstanding treasury notes
amounted to $15,279,600. These sums taken to-
gether and deducted from the whole amount of
$33,000,000, leaves an amount of available notes,
by the table, of $6,285,294 55. The stock having
been issued, and being on a long loan, it is a fixed
amount, and the only question which arises is in
relation to the " notes outstanding." If that is
correct, the balance of $6,285,294 55 is correct. Is
the amount too large or too small ? If it is meant
that some of the notes which are entered as out-
standing, are in fact returned to the treasury, and
not entered on the books, the difficulty would by
this only be increased, and the discrepancy made
so much the greater. If, on the contrary, it is
meant that the amounfbf notes really outstanding
is larger than the apparent amount, because the
amount has been actually disposed of, and the
money received by the department, but the notes
not actually issued, the result would certainly be
to reduce the balance, and to show that the esti-
mated amount of available means for the year was
not $6,285,294 55, but $1,401,900 less than that
amount; which in no manner relieves the diffi-
culty, but shows that he has made the very
error which is claimed, and that his repoit is
not to be relied upon for accuracy on this subject,
and the amount of available means is so much
less.
My own impression is, that in this statement, as
in the otheis, it is only an indication of the utter
confusion and darkness which prevails in the de-
partment of the treasury. And if I am correct in
stating that the error of over$135,000 exists in the
statement of the Register, it leads to the supposition
that the amount of $1,401,900 is inserted to force a
balance.
This difficulty is also sought to be explained by
a writer in the " Union" of yesterday evening, who
himself in no way meets the difficulty. The ex-
planation is as follows:
" The explanation is very easy. Authority is given by law
to reissue such tieasaity notes as may be received m pay-
ment of public due'* or redeemed with specie, provided that
the total outstanding at any one time does not exceed a cer-
tain amount. In this way, after having received upwards
of twenty-five millions from Joans and tieasury notes jn the
fi-cal year mdirig June 30,18J7, and neatly seven millions
in the quarter ending September 30, the Government bad
still power on the 1st of October to bonovv upwards of six
' million*, because parr of the treasury notes previously is-
[ sued bad been redeemed and were by law reissuabJe."
! It will be perccived that I have deducted the
j<4part of the treasury notes previously issued
; (which) had been redeemed and were by law re-
j issuable," and that the balance above referied to
' still remains. . t
\ I refer to this article, because on its facesit ap-
i pears to have come from some officer m the Treas-
ury Department, and is thus semi-official. If any
gentleman in the House will say that it does not
proceed from any such semi-official source, I will
throw it out of consideration.
