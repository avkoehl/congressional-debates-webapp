above all others to obedience on my part while I was in said depart ment, and respect on the part of others who might be in the same department, and at any rate deference from all and every commander touched with or interested in said orders, I ventured to try obedience and elicit [?] from Colonel Howe. I could not see my force transferred, I might say decoyed,and in the face of orders, from the department to which they rightfully belonged into another one. Special Orders, Nos. 3 and 4, Headquarters New Mexico Expedition, were Colonel Howe's final answer, and will amply prove, I expect, the effort I have made, and how my wish was baffled and my purpose frustrated. I had to bow and follow in arrest. Captain Crawford, who had been placed in command, took the detachment through to Fort Union. There the field report of the command was made out and sent to the commander of the post under the signature of Captain Crawford. Such was the state of affairs and such had been when I wrote first letter, the second day after we were at Fort Union. I had no expectation of a change before ordered were received from headquarters of either the Department of Kansas or the Department of New Mexico. Orders, however, came next day. I did not look for any as soon. The first one received was Special Orders, No. 7, Headquarters New Mexico Expedition, releasing me from arrest, an at the same time ordering me to remain at the post until further orders; the second order received was Special Orders, No. 84, Fort Union, N. Mex.; the third and last one Special Orders, No. 106, paragraph VI, Headquarters Department of New Mexico,which last order I have no doubt was the first and only of both the other orders. Be it as it may, I remained, as I was so ordered,in camp under Fort Union,with the detachment over which I had reassumed command, waiting for new orders. Meantime I received from headquarters at the post several special orders, in obedience to which Captain Crawford (A company), upon Orders, No. 86, was detailed with his company after Indians committing depredations in the neighborhood June 28, 1862. Captain Moore (D company), upon Orders, No. 87, detached 1 non-commissioned officer and 4 privates for service to Santa Fe June 28, 1862; and upon Orders, No. 97, detailed 1 non-commissioned officer and 5 privates to escort Paymaster Fillmore from Fort Union to Santa Fe June 30. Captain Crawford returned the third day after he had been detailed, and was able to attend to the matter of the detachment by Major H. D. Wallen, Seventh U. S. Infantry, commanding post and mustering officer. Orders, No. 99, issued July 1,and ordering the command to Fort Lyon, was forthwith acted upon and preparation made to march without unnecessary delay, and on the 5th instant, with one section of the Ninth Wisconsin Battery of Artillery, added to my original command by the order above named, I started from Fort Union, leaving behind the 11 men of Captain Moore's company, for the return of whom to this command Major Wallen said he would answer himself should they ever report to him.

I have mentioned all the facts connected with my command.

I send in a special package copies of all orders which directed or controlled my actions and conduct.* I have thought them necessary to enlighten you, and feeling that upon such proofs in support of my report you will do me entire justice and give me credit for the manner in which I have acted on every occasion, I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FISK,

Major, Commanding Battalion Second Regiment Kansas Vols.
