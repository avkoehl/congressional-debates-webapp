General MEADE:

I have the honor to state that twenty-four rebel deserters were forwarded to this office to-day, bringing in with them the following property: twenty muskets and three Sharps carbines. The men were representatives of Wallace's, MacRae's, Scales', Cooke's, and Barringer's brigades. An informat of Wallace's brigade, Twenty-third South Carolina, states that it was rumored in the above brigade that Bushrod R. Johnson's division was to move to the right near Hatcher's Run, and that a division from the same place was to move up to the left and occupy Johnson's line. Another informant states that Lane's brigade has moved back into the quarters occupied by the brigade all winter; also taken up the same picket-line. An informant of Barringer's brigade (cavalry) states that Barringer's and Dearing's brigade, under the command of General W. H. F. Lee, have gone to Dinwiddie Courth-House. Broke camp yesterday morning; carried everything with them.
