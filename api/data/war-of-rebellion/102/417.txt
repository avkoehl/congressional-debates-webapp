Camden; also two batteries of artillery kept at that place for want of horses to draw them to Marshall, Tex., at which place nearly all the rebel troops are assembled. Rebel officers are making great efforts to persuade the men to go to Mexico and establish a colony, but the men are opposed to it, and are willing to return to their allegiance on any terms.

W. W. Frazier, scout, sent from Little Rock to Camden on the 30th of last month, returned to-day, and makes the following report:

Went within twelve miles of Camden, at which place there are about 200 of Shelby's command, dismounted, about 100 of Deckery's, and two batteries without horses. These batteries would have been taken to Marshall, Tex., but they are entirely without horses. The great body of the rebel force is at Marshall, Tex. The officers are making strong efforts to get the meant to go to Mexico and establish a colony. The men are generally opposed to this, and are willing to return to their allegiance on most any terms.

I inclose copy of Texas Republic, extra. Kirby appears to be a "last-ditch" man.
