Major-General DODGE:

I will modify over to meet your suggestion. Thanks for prompt change of troops on Kansas border. The Second Missouri Artillery, Colonel N. Cole commanding, has 1,400 men and 800 horses. Average unexpired term of enlistment nearly two years. I suggest that it be converted into a cavalry regiment.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,May 21, 1865-11. 30 a. m.

Colonel MORRILL, Rolla:

See if those armed bands will not surrender same as those in Central District and North Missouri. They give up their arms and horses, take the amnesty oath, if they remain in Missouri, or be paroled if they want to go South. If they do this the U. S. military authorities will not molest them, so long as they live up to the agreement and obey the laws where they reside. All armed forces in Arkansas have surrendered.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, MO., May 21, 1865.

Major-General DODGE, Saint Louis:

I arrived here yesterday. To-day Dave Pool and forty men surrendered. Twenty-seven have heretofore surrendered to Captain Rogers, assistant provost-marshal. Pool will help us to bring in the rest of the bushwhackers, and is willing to go out for that purpose to-morrow morning. I shall send Lieutenant Saltzman, acting assistant adjutant-general, and an escort to accompany him. I think we will soon put an end to bushwhacking here. I may remain here a few days. All who have surrendered deliver up their horses and arms.

C. HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major-General DODGE:

Pool has agreed to go out to-morrow with an escort of my men and use his influence to collect bushwhackers. He thinks he will be gone four or five days. Lieutenant Saltzman, acting assistant adjutant-general, will go with him, and will order my scouting parties to hold up until we can see what will be done.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, &c.
