RECTORTOWN, July 20, 1863-5 p. m.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH:

I have just dispatched the reserve to Manassas Gap, and the First Brigade, with guns, to Chester Gap. I have seen no enemy worth naming; about 40 or 50 of Mosby's, a few of White's, and some stragglers from Jones. I apprehend no trouble at either gap. I was detained longer that I anticipated by having to reconnoiter Ashby's [Gap]. The information I received about Ashby's [Gap] last night was ugly. This morning it was disproved. I will move to-night with Devin and the trains to near Salem. Where shall I go next? My train is empty, save rations. I am, your obedient servant, JNO. BUFORD, Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

CAMP NEAR UNION, VA., July 20, 1863-9 p. m.
