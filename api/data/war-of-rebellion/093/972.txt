I therefore want you to telegraph me at once the earliest information you get of his advance. Your telegram of last night received. I hope Croxton has placed reliable men on the two roads leading out from Florence to Huntsville and Pulaski.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

PULASKI, November 21, 1864-11 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

Your dispatch of 9 a.m. is received. I will instruct Croxton to be sure to watch carefully the roads from Florence toward Huntsville and Pulaski. If compelled to abandon any portion of this country, shall we destroy the flour mills?

Major-General.

PULASKI, November 21, 1864-12 m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I propose to move to-morrow morning with two divisions to Lynnville, leaving Stanley here with the other two. This will be the best disposition we can make to meet Forrest if he attempts a raid. Then, if Hood advances with his entire army, Stanley can join me at Lynnville, where we can fight Hood, or retire to Columbia, according to circumstances. I do not believe Hood can get this far, if he attempts it, while the roads are so bad, and Smith may be able to join us before they get better. It will be well to avoid the appearance of retreating when it is not necessary. I will leave Stanley unincumbered, so that he can move freely. Upon reflection, I think it wisest not to leave a small garrison here. We ought to concentrate as much as possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

PULASKI, November 21, 1864-6.30 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

General Hatch's report of 8 a.m. seems to leave no doubt of Hood's advance, and that he is going to Columbia or west of that place. I will make preparations at once to move accordingly to-morrow. I may, however, get later information by to-morrow morning.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 21, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Pulaski:

Have you seen General Hatch's dispatch from Lexington of 8 a.m. to-day? It is very detailed, and he thinks it reliable. I have just received your two telegrams of 11 a.m. and 12 m., and approve the
