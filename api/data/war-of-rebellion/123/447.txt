Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

We telegraphed you some days since for our full quota of men under the two calls for 75,000 and 300,000 volunteers. We have as yet had no official information of our quota. Will you answer?

Brigadier General C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Enrollment progressing. Commissioners and surgeons, rendezvous and commandants selected. Expect everything will be ready by September 3. Before that date it is probable the greatest par of our quota of militia will be filled by volunteers without awaiting a draft.
