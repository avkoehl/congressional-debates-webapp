CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Montgomery, April 21, 1861.

J. P. WOOD, Esq.,

President Memphis and Ohio Railroad:

SIR: In compliance with the request of the Secretary of War, it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th of April, inclosing the resolution passed by your Board of Directors to pass over the Memphis and Ohio Railroad all troops and munitions of war for the service of the Confederate States free of charge. It is truly gratifying to the Government, in the midst of its labors for the general defense of the Southern States against a perfidious and incendiary foe, to receive such evidences of self-sacrificing and fervent patriotism, and I cordially thank yourself and your directors in the name of this Department for your generous resolution.

With high consideration and respect, your obedient servant,

JOHN TYLER, Jr.
