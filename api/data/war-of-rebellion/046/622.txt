REMARKS.-In column "Left uninjured" are set down all guns that are buried. If some are injured that fact could not be ascertained. It is thought that the majority of guns even in that column are injured. The only gun in working condition is a 32-pounder smooth-bore, situated at the extreme left of northwest casemate battery.

Numbers 5. Reports of Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Elliott, jr., C. S. Artillery, commanding Fort Sumter, of operations September 5-December 31.+

September 6.-I have the honor to make the following report:

I assumed the command of this post yesterday, pursuant to orders from department headquarters. There has been no direct fired upon the fort. Two monitors took position after dark and kept up a continuous fire upon the entrance to the harbor during the night, throwing grape and shrapnel. At about 12.15 a. m. heavy firing from the enemy's land batteries and heavy musketry firing induced a belief that an assault was being made upon Battery Gregg. I submit the engineer's report, and would recommend that the timber for bombproof be sawed up in the city, as there are no facilities for doing it here.

There are eighteen days' ration for the garrison. I would also draw your attention to the fact that there is no quartermaster at the post.
