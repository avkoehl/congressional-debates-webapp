suggested by the Senator, and the other, that of
bringing the whole duties to one uniform low aver-
age ad valorem, without any discrimination for or
against any duty It would be too sopn to dis-
cuss the relative merits of the two at this time,
and, in fact, he had not made up his mind A
review must soon take place, it cannot be post-
poned beyond one or two years, when it will be
the proper time to examine their respective merits
in tne mean time he was prepared to say that he
would be ready to go into it with a hbeial spirit
and a disposition to do equal and exact justice to
all, and to adopt that which, after a full examina-
tion, shall appear to be the best calculated to pro-
mote the interest and harmony of the whole.
SWAItTWOUT'S DEFALCATION.
REMARKS OF HON. F.THOMAS,
OF MARYLAND,
In the House op Representatives,
January 9, 1839,
On the Resolution providing for the appointment
of a Committee to inquire into the Defalcations
of Samuel Swartwout.
The question being on Mr Wise's amendment
that the committee be chosen by ballot—
Mr THOMAS rose amidst loud cries for the
question.
He said-1 am not, Mr Speaker, to be checked
by rude calls from any quarter. I have unfeigned
respect for the wish of a majority of this House,
and believing that there is a desire to take the
question before we adjourn, I shall compiess my
remarks within a very short space of time But
I have a right to be heard When it is recol
lected the opponents of the Administration have
consumed nearly all of the time which has been de-
voted to this debate, it is but íeasonable that they
Bhould hear patiently and politely oneof its friends
In accordance with my promise to be brief, I
shall omit everything I was about to say as to
the conduct of the Secretary of the Treasury and
officers of his Department involved in this dis-
cussion Whether they could, or could not, by
the exercise of due diligence, have prevented the
loss of much of the public money that has been
embezzled, I will not now inquire When all the
facts, if there are any more material facts to be
collected, are brought to light by the committee to
be appointed, it will be time enough to examine
how far these officers are culpable
The first question now before us is that brought
forward by the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
Garland ] He proposes, in this instance, to de-
part from the usual mode of appointing commit-
tees, and to elect the committee now to be chosen
by ballot. After hearing the arguments which
have been urged in support of this proposition, it
is one that should not receive my vote, no matter
what was the nature of the duties to be performed
Gentlemen complain that our presiding officer has
placed upon some of the most important commit-
tees ordered by the House a majority of the friends
of the Administration,and urge this circumstance
as good cause for depriving the Speaker of the
power to make the selection m this instance.
This argument ought not, surely, to have an in-
fluence upon those by whom the Speaker was
chosen. We voted for him because he was known
to be friendly to the Administration We ex-
pected that he would, in. compliance with the uni-
form practice of those who had preceded him,
place upon the most important committees a ma-
jority of the friends of the Administration. The
dominant party in the House is responsible to the
country for the public measures to be brought
forward by the standing committees, and ought to
nave the power necessary to frame and fashion
those measures before they are reported. This
has been always conceded. It should be claimed
now, unless, indeed, the friends of the Admims
tration are willing to admit that they are not to be
confided m, and that the superior patriotism of
their opponents must be put m requisition For
one, for myself, and for my political associates
here, I spurn indignantly all insinuations and im-
putations tending to such a conclusion If the
friends of the Administration have the majority I
in this House, they should claim and exercise the
right, through the Speaker, to organize the im-
portant committees If th y are in a minority,
produced by a combination of Conservatives and
Whigs, they must submit, and will be relieved by l
the country fiom that responsibility to which they
are now held, under the belief that they have con- ¡
trol in this body
Not content with denouncing, generally, the
Speaker for the manner in which he has orgaiized
the comm'ttees, tne gentleman from Virginia [Mi
Wise] has selected an instance to prove that these
denunciations are  merited     If the  other  cases
which he has not adduced are like that particularly
referred to, the gentleman has done,m my opinion,
cruel, gross, monstrous injustice    The select com-
mittee on the subject of the public lands was to I
consist, according to the order of this House, of
one member from each of the States.  In executing I
this order, the Speaker had not unlimited discre-
tion.   He was required to select one member of j
the committee from each State     He was bound
to suppose, too, that the House designed that the
will of the several States should be respected in i
the selection of the member of the committee to
which the States were to be respectively entitled   I
Take, then, these most obvious considerations into
view, and it will be seen that gentlemen who com-
plain that their peculiar opinions as to the manner
in which the land fund is to be disposed of are
not probably to be sanctioned by this select com-
mittee,are themselves in fault   If they had ordered
a committee to be appointed generally, without
imposing limitations upon the Speaker, he could
have had reference  to  the supposed will  of a
majority of the House     But the movers in this
matter thought proper  to do otherwise     They
have directed that «he States, without regard to
population, should be put upon an equal footing '
in the committee, and now complain because then ¡
own rule, when fanly worked out, does not show
that a majority of the States and a majority of
this House concur as to the mode in which the !
land fund shall be disposed of   In support of the
premises upon which their reasoning is founded,
I beg leave to advert to a few facts     The com- ]
plaint against the Speaker is founded in the sup-
posed fact that a majoutyof this land committee
is hostile to the distribution among the several
States of the money derived from the sales of the
western lands     Could the Speaker, consistently I
with the order of the House, have produced a I
different result >  There are ten States represented I!
here having lands within their limits, and known   '
to be hostile to the distribution.   From each of
these States, then, ten members of the committee ¡J
were necessarily to be taken hostile to that plan    j
Prom New Hampshire the representation harmo- I
nizes in hostility to distribution, so that no sound il
objection can be urged to the selection of the gen- ¡j
tleman who has been chosen to represent that State    I
The member of the committee selected for Georgia
has submitted a plan of his own for disposing of .1
the proceeds of the land sales, he is one of the   I
majority of the delegation from that State, and 1
know no reason why the Speaker should suppose
that he would not act in accordance with the wishes
of those whom  he in part represents     From   i
Maine, the member of the committee coincides in
opinion on this subject with the majority of his
colleagues, and, I presume, will speak the senti-
ments of the party known to be in the ascendency   I
in that State   The member of the committee from
Pennsylvania is one of the majority of the delega-
tion from that State here, and ¡s of the political
party in the ascendency at home, and could, there-
fore, without impropriety, be selected to represent  |
the State    In addition to this, he was not heie at  í
the commencement of the session, to be placed on
one of the standing committees, and this furnished j
good reason for the preference given him over his |
colleagues      Here, then, are fourteen  members ,i
of this committee, being a majority, for whose "
selection  an unprejudiced  mind  can  find  good   J
and sufficient reasons, without imputing to the   I
Speaker a desne tu thwart a favorite measure of
any one    It is not necessary, therefore, to review
further this proceeding, to vindicate the Speaker
from a most unjust attack    If it were necessary
to do so, material could be found in the cnoice   j
made of members of this committee from Virginia  '
and Vermont Trom the latter State a fr.end of
the Administration has been oveilooked, and the
p-efeience properly given to one of its opponents
And fiom Virginia i gentleman has been selected
who is m the minority of the delegation fiom that
State hete, and who must be in the minority at
home, unless the people of the State have changed
their opinions, and are now in favoi of distributing
the money of the United States for purposes of
education and internal improvements in the States
Although the last gentleman named may not ac-
cord in opinion with the sentiment of his State,
yet, as there is reason to doubt upon that question,
there can be no objection to his selection, as he,
like the gentleman from Georgia, has a favorite
plan, to be submitted to the committee of which
they are members. These considerations were
urged by me privately to the gentleman last re-
ferred to [Mr Robertson] in conversation, soon
after this committee had been selected, when I
had enjoyed no opportunity to learn the motives
by which the presiding officer had been influenced
They were then, they are now, esteemed by me
good reasons to remove unfounded suspicions, and
to guard against ungenerous imputations. Besides,
where do gentlemen get the extraoidinary notion
that this committee was to be composed of gen-
tlemen^ majority of whom were to favor any
particular measure ' There is certainly nothing to
be found in the proceedings of this House to justi-
fy such an opinion To this committee the Hous«
has referred a communication from the Land Of-
fice, and varying projects offered to the House by
different members. This being the case, there can
be no pretext for the supposition that one plan foi
disposing of the proceeds of the lands was to have
given to it a preference over another in the organi-
zation of the committee It was the duty of ths
Speaker to place upon the committee members re
fleeting every variety of opinion which have been
indicated in this House, as far as this could b 
done consistently with his obligation to choose
one member from each State And this he has
done in a manner that ought, with all liberal men,
to shield him from censuie.
Finding nothing m these proceedings to destroy
confidence in the Presiding Officer of the House,
I must be permitted to express my regret that two
gentlemen from Virginia, [Mr Garland and Mr
Mason,! who were elected as fnends of the Ad-
ministration, and who represent districts supposed
to be of the same creed, should separate from their
former political associates upon this occasion. It
cannot be contended that the committee to be ap-
pointed will have much to do in connection with
any default that has occuired, except those of the
collectors and attorney of New York. The reso-
lution before us is very general in its terms, and
has reference to all defalcations of public officers
from the origin of our Government to the present
moment But then we all know that the extracts
from the public íecords have furnished all the in-
formation expected to enable us to judge of the
conduct of those public officers who are involved
m those transactions. So far as the officers of
the Government are concerned, we have no reason
to expect that further information will be collected
in the New York defaults. We have before ua
extracts from the public documents in these cases
also, sufficient to decide upon the culpability and
capability of the Secretary of the Treasury and
his subordinates What, then, is this committee
to be especially appointed for' Not, sir, to afford
an opportunity for a combination of Whigs and
Conservatives to make a report against an inde-
pendent Treasuiy Not, sir, to get up by such
means a book or treatise on our financial condi-
tion, to be distributed with a vew to prejudice the
public mind against the leading measuies of the
Administration We i ave a right to suppose that
this committee is to be orgarized for some prac
tical parpóse We know that the cohectoi at
New York has embezzled a very large amount of
public money We desire to know where this
money is, to see whether any portion, and what
portion, of it can be recovered These be'ng the
objects for which this oommutee is to be appointed,
let us look to the facts of the case to determine
upon the propitety of depnvmg the Administra-
tion of the advantage of having the investigation
commuted to a majority of its Inends.   The Ad.
