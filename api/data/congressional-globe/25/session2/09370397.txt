Northeastern Boundary—Mr. Strange,
H of iieps.
\ernment, "that if a negotiation be entertained at
all, upon the unsatisficlory basis afforded by the Bri-
tish counter proposition or substitute, the President
will not invite it, unless the aulhonties of Maine
shsll think it more likely to lead to an adjustment
of the question of boundary than the General Go-
vernment deemed it to be, although predisposed to
see it m the most favorable light." What should
Mame do under such circumstances'2 She had
alieady repeatedly seen her citizens arrested, im-
prisoned, and punched unjustly by a foreign Go-
vernment She had been admonished and en-
treated by the General Government to desist from
doing any act upon the disputed territory that
might be inconsistent with the understanding that
was said to be had between the two Governments
as to the territory during the pene mg of the ques-
tion, and while endeavoring to conform thereto,
she found the claims of New Brunswick enlarged
and extended until they covered one-third of her
whole territory, and that a warden was commis-
sioned by a foreign power to watch over, and osten-
sibly to protect the territory from depredation, and
at the same time the valuable timber upon it was
fast disappearing
Maine had often remonstrated to this Govern-
ment against these violations of her rights and ter-
ritory, and entreated the aid of this Government to
settle the line of boundary and to obtain redress for
the many wrongs done to her All had failed,
and no hope was left, as she was informed, of set-
tling the question upon terms which the Geüeral
Government would "venture to invite," unless
Mame should desire it To such terms she could
not agree, and hence resolved to request her Sena-
tors and Representatives m Congress to procure, if
possib'e, The passage of the bill now undei conside-
ration, authorizing the P'c-idsnt to run and mark
the line according to the treaty of peace, pnd if
that fail, and the Government of the United States,
either alone or in conjunction with Great Britain
or the State of Maine, shall not, by the 1st of
September, establish and appoint a commission
for a survey of scud boundary line, then it shall be
tie duty oí the Governor to appoint surveyors
and to run and locate the boundary. What is
there lash or impolitic in this measure' What
other mode is left for Maine to obtain hei rights?
If the General Go/etnment, after having made at
th" UH session an appropriation for this object,
will not «oil! direct the line to be run, will they
etet do it' It ever, when"* The Senator from
Pennsylvania says after we shall have waited the
result of the pending negotiation1 But recollect
that when this resolution of Maine was passed
there was no negotiation pending, nor any reason
to expect that it would be renewed unless Maine
should desire it, and she knew, if she did not make
herself so understood, that she did not desire it
upon the inconclusive and unsatisfactory basis pro-
posed.
Then I would again a«k, What should Maine do
to obtain her right, and a boundary line accordmg
to the treaty? Was any other mode left to her than
those contemplated by the resolve, viz firs , to get
Congress to authorize the President to run and mark
the line if that fail, then to get the President, with
the aid of the former appiopnation for this object,
either aloue, or in conjunction with Great Britain if
she will, or with Maine, to establish a commission
Jor the iuney of the boundary line, by the 1st of Sep-
tember, and the other mode failing, thirdly, that
the Governor should forthwith cause the line to be
ascertameJ, ran, and located If the lme be ever
run, it mu^t be done m some of these modes If
Congress will not authorize it, and the President
will not do it, eithei alone or with Great Britain,
or witn Maine, then Mame must do it, or it will
not be done Then shall Maine be considered to
have acted rashly in adopting her resolutions'* Do
they propose any thing beyond what the exigency
of the case demands? If not, ¡hen the Senator
from Pennsylvania was wrong in supposing that
her acts were more the effects of passion than of
policy?
It has been fuither said that Maine acts incon-
sistently in finding fault with the late proposition
of the Piesident to the British minister, that her
Government and Legislature invited the measure,
and when adopted, it is complained pf Wheth r
or not Maine be liable to this charge, depends upon
her acts, and a just construction of her reso-
lutions. It may be, and probably is true, Mat
her acts and resolutions have been considered
by the President as indicating h r aesire for
the establishment of a commis 'on of explo-
ration aid survey, but knowing, as I do, th 
feelings of the peop'e of Matne upen ih s question,
and having i-xamined the report of the committee
to whom Mr Forsyth's letter, and the rie<=ssíe < f
'he Governor, were referred, I *m well satis<W ¡h<u
it was not intended by the Legislature, or by her
.¿solutions, to express any desire for the creation
of a commission upon the principles proposed by Mr
Forsyth to Mr. Fox, in his letter of ¿7th April l?s<
and untes they did desire the creation of such a
commission,it was not to be expected that it would
be invited by the President
The Senator from Pennsylvania supposes that
the resolution of Mame does, in terms, ask such a
commission, and if not m terms, it is fa rly* to be
inferred from an omission to negative it, as was
done in reference to the conventional 1 ne, and t
the appointment of a new arbiter He on^ru^
that part of the resolution which «ays "that it the
Government of the United States, either alone, or
in conjunction with Great Britain, or th > Stale of
Maine, shall not, on or before the 1st of Septem-
ber, establish and appoint a commission for a sur-
vey of said boundaiy I ne" to mean "the establish-
ment of a joint commission oí survey and explora-
tion, upon the basis of the original American pro-
position and the modificat'oas offend by Her Ma-
jesty's Government," as proposed to Mr Fox by
Mr Forsyth, and so, it would seem, the President
must have resabed it, or he would not have ven-
tured to raí i e it, in con'radic on of what had b<>en
said to Mr Vox in ti * let'er of Mr Forsyth of 7th
February last
The Leg slatui e of Mame has not, as vet, had
any opportunity to say whether or not the conduc-
tion of the Senator, and of the Piesident, is in ac-
cordance with their understanding of the lesolu-
tion; and it remains for the Governor of that
State to determine whether the proposition bow
made, if accepted,' will establish and appoint such
a commission for a survey of said boundary Lne"
as will relieve him from the obligation imposed by
the resolution "to appoint forthwith suitable com-
missioners aed survejors for ascertaining, running,
and locating the Northeastern boundary of th's
State, and to cause the same to be carried into ope-
ration " Wh le I would not instst that the Gov er-
nor may not so regard it, I cannot suppose that, in
forming the resolution, the Legislature had in vie-v
any such commission as is now proposed, but that
the "survey of said boundary line," nrevhoneó1 >n
the resolution, was saca a survey ot the boundary
line according to the treaty of 1783, a« is mer>' on-
ed in the bill now b-fore Congres  ana as is to be
made by the Governor in the event of cuch a
survey not be rg made in the other modes meatior-
ed in the res he
But, suppose the Pi evident did unders'and tie
resolution and the Governor's letter as desiring the
appointment of such a commission, and hence di-
rected the proposition of Mr ForsvthteMr Fox ct
the 27ih April, shou il that prevent the jns<ng<? of
the prooosed bill to authorize the President to run
and mark the houndaiy line according to the treaty
of 1783? This may depend upon «hat tin i pro-
position is, and the probnbihtv of its leading to any
satisfactory result If it means what the words or-
dinaiuy imply, it might lead the commits on  o such
a survey as would make 'he final settlement of ihe
line more difficult than it now is, especia'h it such
commission shonll be ' instiuc,od o look fti h in-

The unexpe-ted information that suc'i a propo-
sit on, and the apparent broad terms in wi fh it
was made, as are contained m Mr  Forsyth's note
to Mr. Fox oe 37tn April, produced alarm and
anxiety for the rights of Mame, and very naturally
induced expressions wh eh the Senator irorfl. Penn-
sylvania considers as fii \\r>% fault with the Admi-
nistration f-vr do ng that which "vas understood to

snd in wle of doubts which her Majesty s Govei íment st 11
en ertam ol th   efficacy of the measure
In Mr Forsyth's reply of 7th February, 1338,
speaking of the Bni'sH proposition, he savs "It
merely contemplates a coihmiss,on of boundary
analogous to that appointed under the 5ih article
of the treaty of Ghent, and iooit!<J tit all probabil >y
proie equally unsai-i*fcctoiy in practice, an^ to tne
President will not venture to inv e it unle«s the
authorities of the State of Maine shall think it
more likely to lead to a final adjustment of the
question oí bou n'ary than the General Govern-
ment deems it to be. '
Now allow me to ask what po sibie good can be
expected to íesult from the proposed commission of
exploration and survey? Both Governments under-
stand that it can lead to no useful result, and ex-
perience proves that it will be so Then why
enter upon it, and suffer the delay, without any
prospect of settling the question?
The commissioners under the treaty of Ghent
had the power to ascertain and determine the point

they were to make report of their doings to then
respective Govermrems, aLd the question was then

is not to have that power, but are to be limited to

Ghent, seven'een veais were spent in forming the
