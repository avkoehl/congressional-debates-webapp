nature of the service may require ' In the exercise of this
discretion, the committee are informed by the Secretary of the
Navy that he proposes to employ a squadron in the Mediter
ranean, consisting of two ship" of the line, four frigates, and
four sloops and brigs— mall, ten vessels, another squadron on
the Brazil station, consisting, also, of two ships of the line four
frigates, and four sloops and brigs, which two squadrons will be
made from time to time to exchange their stall ms and thus to
traverse the intermediate portion of the Atlantic He proposes,
further, to employ a squadron in the Pacific, consisting of one
ship of the line, two frigates, and foui sloops and a similai
squadron of one ship of the line two frigates and four sloops
in the East Indies, which squadrons in like manner exchanging
fiom time to time thvir sta ions, wil! tiaverse the intermediate
portion of the Pacific, giving countenance and protection to the
whale fishery in that ocean He proposes further, to employ
a fifth squadron, to be called the home squadron, consisting of
one ship sf the line, three fi igatcs, and three sioops which, be
side the dutie& which its name indicates, will have devolved
upomt the duties of the West India squadron, who&e cruising

in commission seven ships of fie line sixteen fugates, twenty
three sloops and brigs, and eight steamers—m all, hfty lour ves

Mr. B said this was an a'ithenUe declaration of
what was intended to be dene by virtue of the
President's discrelion, under the act ef 1806, if not
controlled by Congress. Five squadrons are to be
employed; fifty-four vessels are to be in eommis-
Sten, and the class ef the vessels composing each
squadron is given in detail Has any one (said
Mr B ) calculated the amount of this increase, and
counted up the amount of men and monev which
it will co t? The report does not, and, in lhat re
spect, is essentially defic cDt It ought to be
counted, ana Mr. B would attempt it He ac
knowledge^ the difficui y of such aa undtrtaking
how easy it was for a spesker—and c pecial v such
a speaker a^ he wat>—to gtt in o a fog w jen h  got
into masses ot millions, a id to bewilder others as
well as himseli. To avoid this, details mast be
avoided, and lesalts made plain by simplifjin  Ihe
elements of cal ulation He wou'd endeavor to
do so, by taking a few plain data, in this case—ihe
data correct m themselves, and the results, there-
fore, mathematically demonstrated
He would take the guns and the n ea—show
what we bad now, and what we propose 1 to have,
and what was the cost of each gun afloat, and the
number of men to work it. The numoer of guns
we now have afloat is nine hundred and th'rty-
seven, the number of men between eleven and
twelve thousand; and the estimated co«t for the whole,
a traction ovei eight millions of dollars This
would give about twelve men and about $9 000 to
each gun. [Mr Bayard asked how could these
$9,000 a gun b" made oui'] Mr Benton re-
plied. B> counting everything that was nec° stiry (o
give you the use of the gun—everything incident
to its use—everything belonging o the whole naval
establishment The ená, ae ign, aid effect of'he
whole establishment, was to give yoa ths use of t! e
gun That was all that was wanted But, ti get
it, an establ shment bad to be k r> ap of v<st exlent
and vanety—of shops and yarda on land, as well
as ships at sea—of  lanes aid pens ons, as well as
powder and balls Eveiy expense is coanted, and
that gives the cost per gun Mr B said h* wculd
now analyze the gentleman's report, and see what
addition these five «squadrons would make to ih  ex-
pense of the naval es ablishment. The first point
was, to find thenumbei cf guns wh'ch they weie to
bear, and which was the element in ¡he c dculation
that would lead to the results sottgi'for Re-

Here (said Mr B ) n an aggregate of 1 704 saw,
which, at $9,000 each gun, would give 015 336 000,
a  the sum which the trtasury wou'd have to pay
for a naval establishment which would give us the
Use of that number Deduct the difference be-
tween 937, the piesent number oí guns, and this
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
1 704, and you have 767 for ihe increased number
of guns which, at $9,000 each, will give $8,903,000
for ihe ¡ncre-ased cost in money This was the
moneyed rrsult o! the increase. Now take the per-
sonal increase—that \% to «ay, the increased num-
ber of men which the five squadrons would require
Taking ten men and two officers to the gun—*m
ell, twelve—and the increased number of men and
officers requned for 767 guns would be 8 204
Add these to tae 11,000 or 12,000 now m service,
and you have close upon 20 000 men for the naval
peace establishment of 1843, costing about fit teen
millions and a half of dollars
Mi B «aid we had just had a Presidential elec
tion carried on a hue-and ery against extravagance,
and a hurrah fot a change, and a ptomise to carry
on the Government for tmrtecn millions i/dollars,
and here was fifteen and a half millions for one
branch of the service • and tbo e who oppose if are
to oe s* grrat z«d as architects of mm, and enemies
of the navy, and a hue and cry raised against them
for the opposition He said we had just voted a
set ef resolutions [Mr. Clay's] to limit the ex-
penses of the Government to twenty two millions,
and yet here are two-thirds of that sum proposed
for one branch of the service—a branch winch, un-
der General Jackson's administration, cost about
four millions, and was intended to be limited to
about lhat amount. This was the economy—ihe
retrenchment—the saving of the peop'e's money,
wl ich wis promised beiore the election'
Mi B wouid not go into points ?n well stated
by the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr Wood
Burty] tu yisteiday, that cur p.e««nt peace naval
es'ablt hment exceeds the cost of the war establish
m nt during the late war, that we pay far mote
mone>,and get much it wcr gnns and men than
the Briiish do for ihe same money. He would
oil ihe tables which he ha i on hand to prove
these important points, and would go on to say
that it was sn obligation of imperious duty on
Cor-gre^s to arrest the present state of things, to
turn back the es ablishment to what it was a jear
ago, and to go to work at the next session of Con-
gress to regúlale the Untied States naval peace es
¡ablishment by law When that bill carre up, a
great question would have to be decided—the qwes-
tion ot a navy fot defence, or eox offence1 When
that question came on, he would give hts opinion
upon it, and hts reasons for that opinion. A navy
of some degree, and of some kind, all seemed to
be agreed upon, but wha' it is to be—whether to
defend our home«, or carry war abroad—is a ques-
tion yet to be decided, and on which the wisdrm
and ihe patriotism of the country wouM be called
mto req us tion. He wou d onlv •-ay, at present,
tnat coasts and cities could be defended without
grea' fleets at sea. The history of continental Eu-
npe was full of the proofs England, with her
thousand sh ts, could no nothing after Europf was
nady foi her, during the late wars oi the French
i evolution He did not speak of attacks in time oí
peic<>, ike Copenhagen but of Cad z and Tene
riffe in 1797 and Boulogne and Flushing in 1804,
w^ere Nelson, with all his skill and personal da-
ring, and with vast fltets, was able to make no im-
pression
Mr B said the navy was popalar, and had many
fr ends and champions, bu' tnere was such a thing
as killing by kindness He had wa th d the pro-

fhe next amendment was to strike out from the
3d page, lines 55 and 56, in the appropriation for
the improvement and neee«$ary repairs of the na-
vy yard near Pensaco'a, Florida, the woids "and
for a naval constructor at said place, $35,300,"and
insert $33,800, to which
Mr. BARROW moved an amendment, to strike
out as above, but, instead of filling the space with
$33,800, as proposed by the Committee on Finance,
to insert $100 060
Mr. EVANS explained that the difference be-
tween the House and the Finance Committee of
the Senate was, that the Finance Committee
wished to strike oat $1,500 for^ naval constructor,
such officer not being wanted at Pensacola.
Mr BARROW approved of the recommend-
ation of fie Finance Committee in that par-
ticular. Theie was, in fact, no navy yard, there-
fore, no necessity for a naval constructor. Bat he
would have been pleased if the committee had
proposed to increase the appropriation, because it
would then have devolved upon the very able
chairman of Finance to state the necessity for the
establishment of the navy-yard at Pensacola.
Seventeen years ago, Congress decided on estab- .
hshing that navy-yard, and every Congress since
had made appropriations for the purpose. He
btheved the appropriations had already amount  e
to upwards of five hundred and forty thousand deP
Urs, yet no na/y yard has been actually establish- *
ed, capab e of affording even the most indifferent
and common repairs to vessels of the navy On <
lookmgimothe .natkr, he di^coverel tha* $2,420,000
had been expended on navy yards from Norfolk
to N w Hampshire, all intended for the pro-
tection of the North. He did not ODj-ct (o this—
he rejoiced at it, but be did complain that, while
the North is so effectually protected, the South is
left wholiv unpro ected When the Senators from
that region had asked why noth.ng of this kind
had been done for the South, ihe answer was,
that th.i=re were no sur'eys, no estimates, no plans.
An appropriation of $50,000 was made for prep-
arations for the construction of a dry dotk at New
Yo k, and the Commissioners of ihe Navy had
recommended a fuither appropriation of $150,000
wuhout hesitation No surveys or plans were ne-
cessary for that. Now, as to the excuse that no
survey or plan had "been made for the South, he
contended that sufficient hid been done in that re-
spect by Lieutenant Powell, whose survey has
been in the posse sion of he Navy Department for
the last six mo iths Hts report deci ies that Pen-
sacola is the most suitab'e place in the South for a
navy-jard Yet it is now a^s-rted that there is
considerable doubt whether St Joseph, Apalaehi-
cola, or Sh p Island, or some other point, may not
i be more eligible, and, therefore, nothing 'hould be
I    dons until lhat que tion is sealed
He did not suppose §100 000   ffou'd be a suffi-
cient appnpnatio i, but the great value he attach-
I   ed to such an appropriate n in the present bill was,
|    tuat it would be an evidence that Ihe navy yard at
I     Pensacola, authorized seventeen jears ago, was
II   not to be ibmdmed     This bid appropriates a
l|  large sum for the repairs t í the other navy yards
o   the united Sta es, and he would ask the Sena-
¡  tors from the Nonh if it was not as necessary for
11 the pro ection of their commeice mth tie South, to
have ?n effi'-'ent navy yard 11 tae Gu'f of Mexico,
as a any othel pent oí the U uc i'
j       On tne score of eu n iny, it is necessary to com-
I  piee that tnvy-i?rt, lor on i* depend'he safety
anu dereiceof the ¡south    By tic compte'ion of
i tun ravv-}ard, and wi h a lev* navy depots in
suitable points aoout the Gulf, the South would
be able .o contend against any loreign povvei which
cou'd oe brought -against l's commeice
Irte question could be narrowed down to two
pjms—fust, whnher a navj-yard was neces-
s íyiu the South and, then, whether Pensacola was
t e proper p'ace He presumed that r o Senator
