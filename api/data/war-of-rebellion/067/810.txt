The cavalry fighting this year has been dismounted; the enemy has not dared to give us an opportunity to operate mounted, and when dismounted, they have had a great advantage of us from the fact that they have a very large brigade of mounted infantry armed with the rifled musket; but I am proud to say that the division has been signally successful in everything they have been called upon to perform; in fact, officers nor men never fought with more determination or courage. Too much credit cannot be given to the brigade commanders for the gallant and efficient manner in which they performed the duties incident to their position. I cannot speak too highly of the Horse Artillery (three batteries) commanded by Lieutenants Williston, Pennington, and Heaton, serving with the division, and part of the time Lieutenants Dennison and Randol, for they always used their guns to the advantage of every one, except the enemy. The medical department of the division in under the immediate control of the very accomplished surgeon, W. H. Rulison, Ninth New York Cavalry, and it is managed to the perfect satisfaction of all concerned. To the officers of my staff, for their invaluable services they have rendered in battle and on the march, I owe more than I can ever repay, and it would be invidious to particularize, for all seemed to vie with each other who would be first in all that is gallant and meritorious; but those who remain will allow me to express my appreciation of one, now absent, and who may not return, Captain Craig Wadsworth, additional aide-de-camp, a worthy son of a worthy man, son of the lamented General Wadsworth, who has proved himself one of the most gallant, energetic, and meritorious officers who has given his services to his country. From may 26 to June 26, 1864, the division has marched about 400 miles, and in the different engagements has lost as follows:
