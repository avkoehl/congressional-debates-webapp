General Turner has just telegraphed to General Terry that he has not old soldiers sufficient to perform picket duty; that he lost yesterday very advantageous ground in endeavoring to do picket duty with 100-days' men and colored troops; his old men are worn out. I can't very well supply General Turner's demands. Cannot the Eighteenth Corps assist us?
