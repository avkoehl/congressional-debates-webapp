private merchants? This practice must be arretted,
or they msut all be ruined The one or the other
alternative is inevitable What private individual
can enter the cotton market ra competí ion with
the banks of the countiy] Individual enterprise
can accompl sh nothing m such a straggle It
would be tne spear hurled by the fteble hand of
the aged Priam, which scarce reached the buckler
of the son of Achilles The Bank of the United
States, which, according to the testimony of its pre-
sident, might have destroyed, by an exertion of its
power, almost every bank m the country, could,
with much greater ease, destroy any priva te mer-
chant who might dare to interfere with its specula-
tions Such a contest would be that oi Hercules
contending against an infant It can acquire a
monopoly against individual merchants in any
jranch of mercantile business m w rich it may en-
gage, and, after having prostrated all compe ition,
it can then regulate the price of any article of
commerce according to its pleasure I do not siy
that such is either us wish or its intention, but I
mean thus to illustrate the va<=t and dangerous
power which it may exercise as a merchant The
East India company monopolized the trade of Asia,
but it possessed no banking powers It could not,
therefore, by curtailing or expanding it  issues,
make money scarce or make money plenty at plea-
sure, and thereby raise or depress the price of the
articles in which it traded In this respect its power
as a merchant was inferior to that now exercised
by the Bank of tne United Stiles
Hoa vain, then, I might almost say how ridicu-
lous, is it for the people of the South to make the
attempt to establish merchants in the Southern sea-
ports for the purpose of conducting a c'irect trade
with Europe in cotton and other «articles of their
production in opposition to the Bao! of the united
States and their own local banks This effort must
fa 1, or the banks must cease to be merchants I
am glad to learn that, at the late Southern conven-
t on, this alarming usurpation by the banks of the
appropriate business of the merchant has been
viewed m its proper light The time, I trust, is
hot rar distant when they will be confined, by pub-
he opinion, to their appropriate sphere What a
fatal error it is for any free people, tempted by pre-
sent and partial gam, to encourageard foster such
institutions in a course which must, if puisued, in-
evitably crush the merchants of the country who
conduct its foreign trade1 As a class, these mei-
chanto are highly meritorious, and entitled to our
support and protection against a powei which, if
suffered to be exerted, must inevitably destroy
them
Philadelphia is a city devoted to the interests of
the Bank, but even in that city, if it should under-
take to speculate m flour, in coal, or in. any other
article which is poured into her market froauim
rich abundance of the State, such corduct would
not be submitted to tor a moment. The Legisla-
ture of the State would at once interpose to protect
our merchants Such an attempt would at one 
break the spell of bank influence And yet it pos-
sesses no more power to deal in Southern cotton
than it does in, Pennsylvania flour It w ill remain a
banker at home, whilst us mercantile speculations
will be confined to the Southern and Southwestern
province  of its empire
The reason will now, I thm'r, appear manifest
why the Parliament of Great Britain, the Congress
of the United States, and the Legislature of Penn-
sylvania, have so strictly prohibited their banking
institutions from dealing m any thing except bills
of exchange and gold andsiher bullion If the
Bank of England should dare to mvaJe the pro-
vince oí the merchants and manufacturers of
that country in a similai manner, tne attempt
■would instantly be put down Every man ac-
acquamted with the history and cbaiacter of the
people of England, knows that  uch would be the
inevitable consequence And yet this violation of
liw, on the part of the Bank of the United States,
has been lauded m our iree Republic
As I am upon the floor, I shall proceed briefly to
discuss the merits of the bill now before the Senate
It proposes to inflict a fine not exceeding tpn thou-
sand dollars, or imprisonment not less than one nor
more than five years, or both such fine and impnson-
20
ment, at the discretion of the court, upon thoi-e « ho
shall be convicted under its provisions Against
whom does it denounce these penalties1 Against di-
rectors, officeis, trustees, or agents of any corpora-
tion c ea*ed by Congress, who, after its term ol ex-
is ence is ended, shall reissue the dead notes of the
defunct crrporation, and push them into the circu-
lation of the country, in violation of its original
charter The bill embraces no person, acts upon
no person interferes with no person, except those
whose duty it is, under the charter of the old Dank,
to redeem and cancel the old notes as they are pre-
sented for payment, and who, in violation of this
duty, send them again into circulation
This bill inflicts severe penalties, and, before we
pass it, we ought to be entire'y satisfied, first, that
the guilt o' the mJividua's who shall violate its
provisions is sufficiently aggravated to justifv the
punishment second, tnat ths ¡aw will be politic m
«sell, and, third, that we possess th  constitutional
power to enact it
First, then, as to the nature and aggravation of
the offence The clnrter of the late Bank of the
United States expired, by its own limitation, on the
3d of March, 1836 After that da}, it could issue
no notes, discount no new paper, and exercise none
of the usual functions of a bank For two years
thereafter, until the 3d of March, 1838, it v <xs
meiely permitted to use its corporate name and ca-
pacity " for the purpose of suits for the final settle-
ment itid liqu dation of the affa'rs and accounts of
the corpoiaiion, «nd for tne bale ana disposition of
their estate, leal, peisonal, and mixpd, but not foi
any o'her pinpose, u tn any o'her manner, ukatso-
ev r " Consress had granted the bank no power lo
trake a v olumar} a^ignm-nt of its pi openy 10 a ly
corpf "a'ion c r anv indiviiual On the co trai ,
the phii m"inng oi the nvt i v ¿>s that a1 lh°
affairs it the institution she lid b<, wcuad up by
its om Pre  dent and Dinctors It recei ed
no au'honty to delegare this important trust to
others, and jet what has it do1 ' On the second
day of March, 1836, one day before the charter had
expired, this very president and these directors a -
signed all the property and effects of the old corpo
ration to the Pennsylvania Bank of the United
States On the same day, this latter Bank accepted
the assignment, and agreed t-a "pa}, satisfy, anc"
discharge all debts, contracts, and engagements,
owing, entered into, or made by this [he old]
Bank, as the same «hall become due and pa} able,
and fulfil and execute all li nsls and obligations whaUo
ever arising fioni I's transactions, oi fiom aiy of
them so that every creditor or ughtful claiman*
shah be fully satisfied " By its own agreement, it
has thus expressly created itself a trustee of the old
Bank But this was not necessary to confer upon
it that character By the bare act of accepting the
assignment, i' became responsible, under the laws
of the land, for the performance of all the duties
and tresis required by the oíd charter Under the
c rcumstances, it cannot make the slightest pre-
tence of any want of notice
Having assumed this responsibility, the duty of
the new Bank was so plain th-u it could not have
been mistaken II had a double character to sus-
tain Under the charter from f ennsj Ivania it
became a new banking coiporation, whilst, under
the assignment from the old Bank, it became a
trustee to wind up the concerns of that institution
under the act of Congress These two characters
«ere m their nature separate and distinct, and
never ought lo have been blended Tor each of
these purposes it ought to have kept a separate s«t
of books Above all, as the privilege of circula-
ting bank notes, and thus creatn ¿ a paper curren-
cy, is that function of a bank w h ch most deeph
and vital!} affects the coirmunit}, the new Bank
ought to have cancelled oi destrojed all the notes
of ihe old Bank which i found in its posspision tn
the 4th of March, 1836, and ought to have redeem-
ed the remainder, at its counter, as thev were de-
manded by the holders, and then destroved them
This obligation no Senator has attempted to doult,
or to deny But what was the course of the Bank?
It has grossly violated both the old ana the new
charter. It at once declared independence of both
and appiopnated to itself all the notes of the o d
Bank, not only those which were then still m circu-
lation, but those which had been redeemed before
it accepted the assignment, and were UiPn ijmg
dead in its vaul's I have nov beiore me the first
monthly statement which was ever madp by the
Bank to ihe Auditor General of Pennsylvania it
is dated on the 2d of April, 1836, and signed J
Cowpei'nwaile, °ctmg casher In this statement
the Bank charges itself with "notes issued,"
$36,620,420 16, whilstm its cash accotmt,along with
its specie and the notes of S'ate banks, it credits
itself with "notes of the Bank of the United States
and offices," on hand, §16,794,713 71 It thus
seized these dead notes to the amount of §16,794,-
713 71, and transformed them into cash, whilst
the difference between those on hand and those
issued, equal to $19 825,706 45, was the circula-
tiun which the new Bank boasted it had inhered
from the old It thus, in an instant, appropnat^d
to itself, and adopte 1 as its own c rculatior, al1 the
notes and a 1 the illegal branch drafts of tne eld
Bank which were then in existence Its baldness
was ec^ual to its utter disregard of law In this
first return, it not only proclaimed to the Legisla-
ture and people of Pennsylvania that it had di=ie-
garded its trust as assignee of the old Bank, by
seizing upon tne whole of the old circulation ant"
convening it to its own use, but that it had viola-
ted one of the fundamental provisions of its rxw
charter
In Penns}'vama le have, for man }ears past,
deemed u vv se to i crea c tne specie basis of our
paper circulation We know ih  , under the uni-
versal law efcurrene}, smaa nolps and gold and
s her coin c{ the a^e denomination cannot cir i-
la e togefirr The one will t\pel Ihe other A~-
coidn0iv, it is now long s¡nc° we prohibited our

i m fi\ lolltis Tn° Legislature which rechar
ercd ihe Jank oi the h lined Sta es, deeme i it wise
to proceed one step further in regard to this mam-
moth m« ítu ion, and in tka opm m I entirely con-
cur Accord ngl , b} the sixth fundamental arti-
cle o its charter, the} deciaie tt at ' tn notes and
bills wh ch shall be issued b} order o* *-ai i u '-porn-
ion, or under ib authontv, "hall be binding upon
it, and those made pa} ab'e to order shal" be as-
signab'e by endowment but ¡ one shall b" issued of
a denomina ton less than Uit doll*?s "
Now, it is well known to ever} Senator vvithm
he sound of my voice, that a large proportion of
these resurrection notes, as they have been ap ¡y
c ined, w Inch hue Deen issued and reissued by ol-
der of tne nev bank, are of the denomination of
five doUars Here, then, is a plain, palpable viola-
tion, not only of tb' spirit, but of the very letter of
Us char er The Senate will perceive that the
Bank, «s U to mee i->e very case, i„ not merely
prohibited from iss„ ife ts own notes, signed by its
o vn piesident and cashier, of a denomination less
than ten dollars, but this prohibition is extended to
the notes or bills which shall be issued by its order,
or under its authority If I should even be mistaken in
this construction of the law, and I believ e 1 am not,
it would only follow that us conduct has
not amounted to a legal forfeiture of its char-
ter In bo'h ca«es the violation of the spmt of its
charter, and the contravention of the wise pslicv of
the Legislature, are equall} glaring So entire!}
did th  Bank make these dead notes its own pecu'iar
circulation, that until July last, m its montnly ie-
tutns to the Auditor General of Penns\t ama, toe
