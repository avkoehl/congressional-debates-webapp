CUMBERLAND, August 28, 1864.

Captain PATRIE,

Hancock:

Have you any news this a. m.? Have you heard anything of General Duffie's moving toward Hancock via Hagerstown with his command? Did you send a messenger to General Averell yesterday?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

HANCOCK, August 28, 1864.

Major-General KELLEY:

Messenger I sent to General Averell, whose headquarters is at Hagerstown, has not returned. General Duffie is not moving this way that I know of. I have heard from Martinsburg; no enemy near. Can I run to Cumberland this p. m., and return in a. m.? My men need clothes and medicine badly. Please answer immediately.

P. B. PETRIE,

Captain.

SOUTH BRANCH, August 28, 1864.

General KELLEY:

Report that McNeill is coming down South Branch for purpose, as is supposed, of getting on railroad at some point. Have sent scout out the branch, and will put party in ambush on the ridge on Springfield road.

COMMANDING OFFICER EIGHTH OHIO CAVALRY,

The general commanding the troops in the field directs that you at once place in arrest the officers in command of the detachment of your regiment which was surprised and captured at Huttonsville on the morning of the 24th instant. You will prefer charges and forward them to these headquarters without delay. Acknowledge receipt of this.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Our military agent at Gallipolis telegraphs me this morning, "I have reliable information of Breckinridge's advance into the Kanawha Valley with 8,000, via Lewisburg." General Heintzelman left for Chicago this morning under your order. I have telegraphed him on the way. I have the State battery at Camp Dennison and three regiments of National Guard at Gallipolis. No general officer in the State.

JNO. BROUGH.
