CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, December 19, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I have before me a letter from Captain J. G. McKee, Third Georgia, dated Johnson's Island, December 4, 1863, sent by flag of truce, in which he states that the money which had been sent to him was of no avail, because, owing to the removal of the sutler, he and other officers were unable to buy anything either inside or out. I will thank you to inform me what is the true state of this matter. In order also to enable us fully to understand each other, and to act on reciprocal principles, I will thank you to inform me what is the course of your Government in relation to funds sent by private individuals both within your and our lines to our prisoners in your hands. I will also thank you to inform me what is the course as to contributions of food and clothing sent to the same by private individuals both within our lines and yours. I do not think that you will find any indisposition on the part of the Confederate Government to agree to reasonable and reciprocal terms on this subject.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Captain McKee receives in every respect the same treatment as his brother officers. I saw him in my office a short time ago. He was looking well. He desired an interview with me and I granted it, as I always do when the request is made. His status is that of a prisoner of war.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, December 19, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I have made the inquiry you requested some time ago about Major B. F. Mosely, Fourth Kentucky Cavalry; Captain Lewis L. Cartler, East Tennessee cavalry; Lieutenant E. H. Mason, Twenty-first Ohio; Captain C. S. F. Dircks, Middle Tennessee infantry, and Private John Wollman, Thirty-third Ohio Volunteers.

Major Mosely's irons were removed before he was taken sick. He falsely represented himself as a lieutenant.

Captain Lewis L. Carter was a deserter from the Confederate service. He escaped from prison some time ago.

Lieutenant E. H. Mason is here in Richmond; he has never been in irons.

Captain Dircks has never been in irons.

Private John Wollam was one of the party who stole the engine on the Georgia State road. He escaped from prison, but was subsequently recaptured and put in irons.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
