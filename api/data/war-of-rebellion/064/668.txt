HDQRS. NORTHERN SUB-DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Camp near August, Ark., June 12, 1864.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Some time ago Colonel McCray sent you a communication asking that you send him 2,000 stand of arms, and your reply was favorable to the same. That letter of the colonel's I would most heartily indorse, and say to you while in this connection that I have been sent by General E. Kirby Smith to take command of the Sub-District of Arkansas, lying north of the Arkansas River, and found the scarcity of arms deplorable in the extreme. Over 4,000 men could be added to our standard now, who will have to remain in complete inactivity until they are armed. In the hurry and clash of deadly warfare in which you have been engaged I suppose you have overlooked this item if arms, but I have a sufficient force to convoy them from the Mississippi River, and would be more than pleased to hear from you, and to know that some arrangement could be made to arm these men, now so greatly needed in their country's service.

I am, general, with high respect, your obedient servant,

JO. O. SHELBY,

Brigadier-General, C. S. Army
