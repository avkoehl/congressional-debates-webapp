HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 5, 1864.

[General GRIFFIN:]

GENERAL: General Warren directs that you withdraw just at dark.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. MARVIN, JR.,

Assistant-Adjutant General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 5, 1864.

General GRIFFIN:

You can withdraw immediately after General Cutler. Leave your pickets on till 12 o'clock, and send an officer to me so that I can notify the different pickets to withdraw at the same time. Yours and Cutler's can rendezvous at my headquarters. As the head of your column passes my headquarters it will be put on the right road.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 5, 1864-12.30 a. m.

General CRAWFORD:

I wish you would send me a brigade to the Bethesda Church to be there at daybreak. General Burnside's whole corps is now on your left, and you can get support from him rapidly if needed.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION,June 5, 1864.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: Cannot General Burnside relieve my Maryland Brigade, which is separated by a swamp from the brigade at its right? He has second line in rear of this brigade and apparently abundance of troops to spare. If this is done I can strengthen the line weakened by the withdrawal of Bates. As it is I have my line broken by two swamps and it would be better to have the corps separated by such obstacles than the brigades of a division. The swamp would be a better termination of Burnside's line than the open field where it now is.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

The reserves are not now on the line. They are at work organizing but until the officers are recognized nothing can be done. The list goes to General Meade to-day.
