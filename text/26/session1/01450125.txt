on his owu responsibility, and it wis due to Messrs G des , ni
Seaton to say that he did  o without any consultan >n whatever
* with them What construction others migh make on the
part he had acte I, he di I not know, bu he was sure
that no one who was not capable of com mtling bn
bery himse'f, wiuld consider that letter as a proffer
of bnocry He hid not yet obtained a copy of his la
t*r to General Green, but when he did so, he would lay it
before the House The article in the Globe said tint his letter
was shown first to the Spsaket, as it ought to have been, and
he would call the Si-baker's attention >oihe idea here attempt

so considered it, but—
The PE\KCR said ne knew nothing of the article in the
Globe, to which the gentleman referred, uli he saw it in print.
He never expressed the op nion tint the 'otter shown 10 hi n
was an offer of bribery—out he said at o ce that the proposi
Uon was ina Iro'sgib'e
Mr FISHER, of North Carolina, presumed that it was un
derstood by every Lentleman present that he was the member
from North Carolina to whom allusion was made in the article
id the Globe This rendered it necessary that some exp ana
twn should csme fnm him, in relation to the part he had in
the matter, thougn he regretted that his name should have been
connected with it in any v. ay He had no ambition to figure
in matters of this kind, and it was for this reason that he h id
not spoken of it. The simplest way to explain a subject ol tins
nature was t  tell the whole story , and he would do so with as
much brevity aa possible
About the time that Congress met, he received a letter from
Geieral Green, informing him thithe was a candidate lor the
oiice of printer to the House, and could be elected Taking
I'm to be a circular leiter, common on such occa* on , he laid
the letter aside, and t k>k no further notice of i , and a lew (lavs
after be saw General Green, who said nothing on the sjljcc
Bat a day or so after the Spsakeb was elect d, he, Mr F re
Calved another letter from General fireen, enclosng this leiter
of the gentleman from New Yoik,lMr Mitchell J The state-
ment in the Globe, just read, was made from an explana'ion of
his, [Mr Fisher**,] and on His authority, and alter it was
written out, had been shown to him The Editors of the
G.obe had been accused of having commuted the sa ue ai i that
was proposed m ihe letter of ihe gen leman from New \ork,
and having heard of th.s matter, they called on him for he
purpose ol obtau ing mljrmatio i respi ct ngit. wh c i he, [Mr
F ] felt that it was but sheer justice that he should give them
Now, sir, said Mr F lor the conten a of the1 etier He would
endeavor to give them according to the best d his recollection
The letter begins by saying "that it is pretty well asrertai ied
that Gales and Sea ton coul J not be elected, and that the wn
tei's aversion to Biair was so great, that he wwhed Gen Green
ti come on and be a cnilidate, believing that if he could ceta
few of 1111 friends to vo'e for h,m h" could be elected, t afthc
printing would be worth about «30 OOU, and as Geo Green pro-
bably had not the means of executing it, he could make an ar
rtngemeni with Gales and Seaton to do it for him—lie retain
Ing S.10,000, wuh >ut any risi or responsibility whatever, an I
Gales and Seaton receiving the remaining S<  000 for doing the
work and incurring thetroub e and responsibility " This let
ter Gen Green enclosed to him, (Mr V) desiring lumto
confer w th certain gentlemen on thesubiect, without naming
th m, but by ihe alius oris made, he could not but understand
who General G'een meant He at once, Mr F said, saw the
impropriety of the proposition, and yott, sir, [allressirg the
«makes ]beingthefir«l gen' emin I met of those for whom I
thought the'letter might dp intended, may remember that I said
to you that I haJ received a letter of a very strange charac er,

men referred to l'ou remarked, sir, that the proposition could
hot be entertained fot a mom-nt, but you «aid nothing, as you
have |ost very corre-tly obcrved, about bribery You thought
that 1 ought to exhibit the leiter to some of the gentlemen re-
ferred to in Gen Green e letter
Afier I had left you, I me' w th another gentleman—a distin

General Green, and get rid of the sub, ft altogether But for
my own safety, I showed it to a gentleman Irom South

Mr B1DDLE, aft r proceeding at rami" length in reply to
Mr Coupee ol Georgia said, ill that the Repreyentatives from
the North wished waf, that the South wou d t ike out of the
mou'h of the Abolitionists ihe answer which Ihey wefe affoided
by the action of tha Hou e on ti eir petitions take that
away, and they of the North would put d iwn Abolition
Take away the false issue made there, the difficulty which
disarms them—remove that difficulty, and all danger
wuuld be at an end In his i em irks he had no anxiety
'o operate on the constituency either in the North or the
South, but with perfect simplicity of purpose, give his
v ews as to Ihe bes' course for the House lo puisne He was
thankful the House had pursued a course which permuted gen
tlemen to explnn themselves and define ih ir position, winch
the mere yeas and navs did not show He lelt mat his pósiuon,
firtnrately, was one which enabled htm to appio<uh this sub
ctwuh fw-rfect freedom He took the ground at home, in
e i'y to Abolitionists, that it was inexpedient to giant the
priyer oi the petitions, an 1 urwanan able fr them

though he had b en represented as an Abolitionist, re

sorved perfect silence on the gieat question involving the peace
of the conn ry, he could not be drawn for.1  Itwasantici
pated that he could be lefeated by that gen leman, because of
his silence on that subject, and the bold stand that he (Mr.
Middle) had taken in defeneeof the rights ol the States un-
der the ConBtitut on
Mr B «aid h- had come there with greit dislike to the
course of the petitioners, and although impressed with such
feelings, he had from the course ol that Hou-e and the denun-
ciations which gentlemen heaped upon them, er most at limes
wished hlnisel a lank Ab ilinonist, that he u Ight reply to such
denunciations in tie spun ol one The whole ob|taol these

him if Mr Van Buien did not also say that, notwithstanding
this power existed, he consider d the ixercse of it
sodangero is to tries ability of the Unitw— so inexpedient—that
he wou d ve o any bill tint should be passed by Congress for

Mr l>ll_)I)L,r replied, did not every gentleman on that fleor
who pieeeu ed Abulition pen ions say the sime thing, but the
question was as to tie sincerity ot the pio!e*sion.
If itivas a question of expediency meiely, with whom did
the power rest lo deride it? Ccr an ly wnh Congress—the sub-
ject was at the men y of Congress and consequently at the

might become tnnsiently obnoxious—petitions might be sent m
upon that subject, and lhev could, with equal propriety, spurn
them Irom he halls ol Congie's, as petitions upon the subject
of slavery
TJiis was a mitter which public opinion at last must deci<Je,and

Mr WA rTLRsCS was opp rsed lo the recept on of Abolí ion
petitions in any foim wlntever He would neither receive

consider the right ol petition at all mv u d by rtlie-lng to

a mitter which did concern ihem—ihey hav i g no gner-
ances to rediefce—and a matter about which Congress
had no power to lei slate He hoped the Hcpicstntanvis
