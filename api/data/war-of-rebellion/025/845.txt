RECAPITULATION.

Van Dorn's corps.......................................7,455

Cavalry with Mississippi Army..........................1,018

Cavalry on Mobile and Ohio Railroad....................8,733

This, General van Dorn informs me, was the present strength of the cavalry, as near as he could come to it.

Nothing remains to be said except that the 20-pounder Parrott gun, caliber 3,97, has been applied for at Vicksburg, and as it is unnecessary at Grenada I respectfully recommend that it be sent there.

I am, colonel, with much respect, your obedient servant,

E. J. HARVIE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Inspector-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,Grenada, Miss., January 19, 1863.

Major-General LORING,

Commanding Army of the Mississippi, Grenada:

GENERAL: I have, in compliance with your orders, directed the Second Brigade of Bowen's division to hold themselves readiness to move to Panola. The effective total of this brigade is 1,309. The effective total of Green's brigade (the only other troops of my corps now here) is 2,891.

I communicate these fact so that a different disposition may by made if the brigade order to Panola is too weak for the duties of that position.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

STERLING PRICE,

Major-General, Commanding Second Corps.

VICKSBURG, January 19, 1863.
