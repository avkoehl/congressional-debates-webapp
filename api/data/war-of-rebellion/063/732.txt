the revenue to be derived from an ad valorem tax, with so much country overrun, so much property destroyed, and all profitable pursuits broken up and abandoned. We have no public lands to sell; our custom-houses yield little or nothing; cotton appears to be our chief resource, for those things we most need and must have.

Without money or credit we cannot wage war; without cotton we cannot command money or credit. If the Government has not the power to control the cotton of the country, it certainly has the right. The war is carried on for the benefit of the people, and all the property of the country should be subject to the authorities in order to preserve the rights of the people. The Texas office is acquiring little or no cotton. Its offers to purchase amount literally to nothing in the face of the proposition made by the agents of the State.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. BROASWELL,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., April 4, 1864.

Major General STERLING PRICE, Commanding District of Arkansas:

GENERAL: Fagan's infantry brigade was to-day ordered by telegraph to Shreveport. The lieutenant-general commanding thinks it of very great importance that this brigade should be back upon Red River. It can be best used against either column of the enemy from a position near Shreveport. General Taylor has fallen back to Mansfield, the enemy occupying Pleasant Hill.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. CUNNINGHAM,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

Major General S. PRICE, Commanding District of Arkansas:

GENERAL: I telegraphed this morning for the pontoon bridge at Dooley's Ferry to be sent done by the river to the crossing opposite Walnut Hill. I inclose a communication* from the chief engineer in relation to this crossing. The lieutenant-general commanding instructs me to say that in the event of the enemy crossing Red River near Fulton it may be necessary for you to throw your force to the south and west side to meet him. This bridge being put at Walnut hill will enable you to do this. Major Douglas thinks the pontoons, &amp;c., can be rowed down the river by the detachments of 15 or 20 men left with it by General Drayton. It would probably be will to have an officer of engineers but in charge, and also to have the roads leading from Walnut Hill crossing, in the direction of Linden and Jefferson, carefully examined. Mr. James D. Hutton, assistant engineer, has been directed to make the examination recommended to you above and will report to result to you.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. CUNNINGHAM,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
