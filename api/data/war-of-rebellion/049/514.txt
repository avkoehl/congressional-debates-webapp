FRED T. LOCKE,

Lieutenant Colonel, and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The officer sent to make an examination of Mine Run has returned. He reports that he went in advance of our pickets until the fire upon him became so strong that he was not able to proceed. He reports that the enemy's pickets are in groups of 5 and 7 men in the pits beyond the creek. He reports a bog or swamp on the creek making a distance of 150 yards. He reports that he made his way to the left, and that he saw the picket line of the First Corps advance, and that they were driven back. I have ordered 3 picked men to go to-night and make an examination of the ford.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 29, 1863-7 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your notes of 5.40 p.m. and 6 p.m. are just received. The first, in reference to the trains of the Third Corps ordered up, I am in perfect ignorance. I remember only being informed of the three days' supply especially directed by the general commanding. I beg to assure the general commanding that I never will or wish to transcend his orders, and cannot be accessory to others doing so.
