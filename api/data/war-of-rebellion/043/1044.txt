ON THE 8TH INSTANT WE MARCHED TO BEVERLY FORD, AND CROSSED THE NEXT MORNING AT 6 O'CLOCK. THREW OUT FOUR COMPANIES AS SKIRMISHERS, WHO WERE MISLED BY THE NEXT DETACHMENT, AND WHEN ON THEIR WAY TO JOIN THE REGIMENT, WERE TAKEN BY GENERAL PLEASONTON AND PLACED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON THE RIGHT. WHILE THERE, ONE COMPANY, IN CONNECTION WITH ONE OF THE THIRD WISCONSIN, TOOK 16 PRISONERS OF THE SECOND NORTH CAROLINA CAVALRY, WHICH REGIMENT THEY DISLODGED FROM BEHIND A STONE WALL. I THREW OUT TWO MORE COMPANIES TO TAKE THEIR PLACE, AFTERWARD ONE MORE TO FILL A GAP CAUSED BY THE MOVING OF THE CAVALRY WITH WHOM I CONNECTED ON THE LEFT. THEN SENT TWO COMPANIES TO SUPPORT A SECTION OF ARTILLERY ON MY LEFT, WHICH LEFT ME WITH ONLY THE COLOR COMPANY AS RESERVE. THE MEN, WHENEVER ENGAGED, BEHAVED WELL AND INFLICTED SEVERE LOSS UPON THE ENEMY. WHEN HE ADVANCED, THE THREE COMPANIES LAST DETAILED REJOINED ME, AND I WAS SENT TO THE SUPPORT OF COLONEL UNDERWOOD, THIRTY-THIRD MASSACHUSETTS. WHEN THE LINE WAS DRAWN BACK I WAS SENT TO THE SUPPORT OF GENERAL BUFORD, BY ORDER OF GENERAL PLEASONTON, WHERE I REMAINED UNTIL ORDERED TO TAKE THE TWELFTH CORPS DETACHMENT ACROSS THE RIVER, NEAR WHICH WE CAMPED THAT NIGHT, AND THIS MORNING CAME TO THIS PLACE WITH 20 OFFICERS AND 279 ENLISTED MEN.

OUR LOSS IN THE ENGAGEMENT WAS 1 KILLED, 3 WOUNDED, AND 2 MISSING. I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,
