His Excellency Gov. JOSEPH E. BROWN,Milledgeville, Ga.:

SIR: The movements of the division of the enemy in North Alabama point unmistakably to an attack on Chattanooga.

The force threatening this department by way of Cumberland Gap prevents my meeting such an attack with anything like adequate numbers.

Even of the very small number of troops under my command several thousand are unarmed. Can you not send me two or more armed regiments, or arms to put in the hands of those who are without them? The boxes of arms marked: "J. E. B.." which you directed me to retain, have never arrived. Any assistance which you may render me at this critical juncture will greatly redound to the cause of our country, and be thankfully received by your obedient servant,
