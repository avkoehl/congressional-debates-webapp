PLAQUEMINE, February 4, 1865.

(Received 9 a. m.)

Captain F. SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just received word from Captain Rice, commanding the cavalry expedition sent from here to The Park. He was attacked last night about 12 o'clock by a force of about 500 men, a portion of which attacked him in front, while the remainder attempted to flank him on the left, but failed on account of the high water in the swamp. He is fighting yet and holds his own. One man killed and one wounded on our side. Should they drive him we are prepared for an attack here. Please acknowledge receipt.

R. G. SHAW,

Major, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,New Orleans, February 4, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER PLAQUEMINE:

If the enemy is as numerous as represented, Captain Rice should have fallen back. But it is presumed that the number is much exaggerated. Colonel Sayles, at Bayou Goula, is ordered to send a cavalry force to relieve Captain Rice from any undue pressure and assist in driving the enemy away. In the event of Captain Rice falling back to Plaquemine you must promptly notify Colonel Sayles. You will keep Colonel Sayles posted as to the condition of things at The Park. Keep these headquarters promptly informed if anything important transpires.

By order of Brigadier-General Sherman:

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Captain FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just received a report from Captain Rice at The Park. He has repulsed the attacking party, which consisted of about 150 men, and is looking for further demonstrations. He has sent in 6 prisoners and has 2 more wounded ones with him. Our loss is 1 killed and 1 wounded.

Respectfully,

R. G. SHAW,

Major, Commanding Post.

COMMANDING OFFICER PLAQUEMINE:

Telegram received. It is very good. Let all these scoundrels be either captured or driven well back into rebeldom. Let them be followed up, but so as not to allow them to get into the rear of our own men.

By order of Brigadier-General Sherman:

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
