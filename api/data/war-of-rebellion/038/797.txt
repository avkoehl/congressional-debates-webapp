JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:

A demonstration is now being made in large force at Hard Times. It is indispensable that I have more cavalry. The approaches to Northern Mississippi are almost unprotected, and it is impossible to prevent these raids with infantry.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

General Johnston, Tullahoma:

The enemy is at Hard Times in large force, with barges and transports, indicating a purpose to attack Grand Gulf, with a view to Vicksburg. I must depend upon the Army of Tennessee to protect the approaches through Northern Mississippi.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOWEN, Grand Gulf:

It is probable enemy numbers 1,500; have no information of his movements subsequently to Hazlehurst by interruption of communication. Our cavalry must follow him up.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOWEN, Grand Gulf:

Have reason to believe enemy are striking for Natchez or Baton Rouge. Send courier to your cavalry, with instructions to try and get on their flank and rear. If Colonel [W.] Adams has not gone, instruct him to go on and take command of all the cavalry engaged in this expedition. From Osyka northward, there are eleven companies cavalry operating.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

GRAND GULF, April 28, 1863.

General PEMBERTON:

Reports indicate an immense force opposite me. Harrison is fighting them now.

JNO. S. BOWEN.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

General John S. BOWEN, Grand Gulf:

Have you force enough to hold your position? If not, give me the smallest additional force with which you can. My small cavalry force necessitates the use of infantry to protect important points.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

GRAND GULF, April 28, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Have sent a full report by Major Lockett of my position. Cannot explain by telegraph. I advise that every man and gun that can be spared from other points be sent here. * Cargo of steamer Vigo arriving in Port Gibson safely and being unloaded.

JNO. S. BOWEN.
