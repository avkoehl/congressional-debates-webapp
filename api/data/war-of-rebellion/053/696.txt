MISSIONARY RIDGE,

Dyer's Mill Road, September 23, 1863-7.30 p.m.

General POLK:

GENERAL: I can discover two lines of battle and two works of the enemy on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, and distant from town about 1 1/2 miles. These lines are protected by rifle-pits and extend across the railroad. The enemy are still intrenching at the same point. Behind their second line I can see parks of artillery and ordnance stores. Large columns of dust can be seen extending from the enemy's line of battle to the ferry at foot of Main street. Cannot discover what causes it.

Respectfully,

OTEY,

Lieutenant.
