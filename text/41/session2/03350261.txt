The Tariff—Mr. Maynard.
Ho. op Reps.
since the outbreak of the rebellion have com-
pelled the study of finance and the exhaustion
of all available resources. We needed money,
and a great deal of it. We still need it, and
shall continue to need it, in sums far beyond
our wants prior to the war. To meet this de-
mand a higher rate of duties on imports has
been imposed than ever before known to our
commerce, except daring the war of 1812.
Such duties are often condemned as prohibit-
ory and self-defeating. The argument is that
with high duties imports will be reduced, if not
suspended, causing the revenue to fall off;
whereas if the duties be lowered importations
are increased, and the revenue correspondingly
augmented; in other words, the lower the duty
the greater the revenue. However this may
be in theory the fact is otherwise.
Wehave heard a great deal said in this debate
about prohibitory duties and prohibition. I am
not aware of any duties that are prohibitory.
The gentleman from Iowa seemed to be of the
opinion that the duties on iron are prohibitory.
The custom-house returns do not show it. The
imports of iron and steel, and manufactures of
iron and steel, are given thus :

With some care I have compiled a table of
imports, beginning with the century and omit-
ting those years in which the imports did not
equal the preceding. The imports of 1801
were not equaled until 1805, those of 1807
until 1810, and those of the latter year until
1835. From 183G it was fifteen years, till 1851,
before the imports reached llie same figure.
After this date they increased at irregular
intervals until 1800, the year before the war.
Since the war they have largely increased, and
with the exception of one year, 186S, have
remained quite uniform. The table is worth
studying in connection with the inquiry whether
the largest imports indicate the soundest finan-
cial condition of the country, or the reverse.

Note to Table.—This table vrhen prepared was
believed to be strictly accurato, and is still presumed
to be sufficiently so for the purposes of the present
inquiry. The figures wero derived from the tables
of Mr. Special Commissioner Wells, appended to his
report of January. 1869. They give the imports of
1867 at $411,733,309, and the duties at $176,417,811;
the imports of 1868 at 5373,409,448, and the duties at
$164,464,599 56, all with great precision of statement.
The table appended to his rccent report gives tho
imports of 1867 at 8400,229,017 54, and the duties at
6168,501,650 44; the imports of 1868 at $358,733,068 30,
and tho duties at $160,532,778 78. The volume of
Commerce and Navigation for 1868 gives the total
imports of that year at §371,624,808. The Special Com-
missioner disagrees with this volume as well as with
himself.
I wish gentlemen to consider that the years
1885 and 1886 were marked by much larger
importations than at any previous time, and
the terrible disasters of 1837 followed. In
1856 importations had culminated; more ships
had been built in 1854 and 1855 than at any
previous or subsequent period; our importa-
tions had run up to a higher figure than ever
before, and the result was the disastrous crash
of 1857. Men may buy more than they want.
It is not a matter of economy to buy what we
do not want merely because it is cheap, nor
is it wise for a people to buy more than they
can conveniently find easily pay for.
Mr.-GARFIELD, of Ohio. Will the gentle-
man allow me to make a suggestion ?
Mr. MAYNARD. Certainly.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I notice that
the gentleman as well as a great many others
on both sides of this subject have treated free
trade and a protective tariff as having much to
do with the financial crises of the country. I
desire to ask my friend from Tennessee [Mr.
Mattnard] if he does not recognize the truth
that the condition of the currency, as being in-
flated or less than is needed, was one of the
powerful causes which operated or co8perated
with these financial crises? And is it not a
little unjust to treat one of these causes alone
as causing the financial crises of the country?
And whether all the causes should not be con-
sidered together?
Mr. MAYNARD. Undoubtedly the gen-
tleman is correct. If I had had the honor of
his attention to my remarks upon artificial
money, that is, currency without any intrinsic
value, to supply the place of actual capital, I
think he would have seen that I made due
allowance for that element of disturbance.
The cause to which the gentleman refers is no
doubt a disturbing cause, and comes in in con-
nection with and subsidiary to the causes to
which I referred. Because the time when the
industrial forces of the country are unsuccess-
ful, when the prosperity of the country is at a
low ebb, is the time when a resort is had to
these methods of relief.
Owing to the different tariffs the amount of
revenue derived is entirely disproportioned to
the amount of imports. Contrast the receipts in
1816, of $36,000,000 with $16,000,000 in 1807,
and $26,000,000 in 1835, from annual imports
not very unequal; also $63,000,000 in 1857
with $53,000,000 in 1860, from a slightly in-
creased importation. Since the war the receipts
have been as uniform as the imports, approach-
ing nearly $180,000,000 eachyear. Butthe most
obvious and for present purposes the most in-
structive fact appears by a comparison between
1860, the year immediately preceding the war,
when our imports had reached their maximum,
and the four years subsequent to the war.
Though the imports have increased barely 20
per cent., the revenue derived from them is full
three and one third times as great. And yet
we are told that the present is not a revenue
tariff! The truth is that, for purposes of rev-
enue, it surpasses all previous legislation as
much as in its protection to American labor
and its encouragement to our domestic indus-
tries. It is the only revenue tariff the country
has ever enjoyed.
a protective taeipl'.
At the same time no tariff has given equal
protection to American labor or done so much
to foster and stimulate all enterprises. It is the
highest rate of duty ever imposed except during
the last war with England and under the tariff
of 1828, known in the political parlance of that
day as the "bill of abominations." These
duties are imposed with discrimination upon
such articles as are very largely produced in the
country, and are made to correspond as nearly
as possible to the increased labor cost of the
domestic over the foreign article. When the
wages of American labor are 30 per cent, in
excess of foreign labor, a duty of 30 per cent,
is imposed ; when the excess is 50per cent., a
duty of 50 per cent., and so on. This rule will
apply to the established branches of manufac-
ture, as cotton, woolen, and iron. It is difficult
to see why this is not perfectly fair. If the
consumer choose to employ his own country-
men, let him pay them fair wages according to
the standard of the country. If he prefers to
go abroad and utilize tho cheaper labor of
other lands, let him pay the difference into the
public Treasury. If, on the other hand, the
foreign artisan desires to bring his fabrics into
our markets for sale in competition with our
own workmen, let him pay to the Government
for the privilege what will make the competi-
tion equal. That is fair play and legitimate
protection to our own laborers, the men who
sustain the Government in peace and war.
There are, indeed, branches of industry to
which a greater extent of protection is afforded-;
such as are not established and are as yet in a
tentative condition. They manifestly need a
higher rate of protection against established
concerns with abundant capital and skilled
labor, whose products have a recognized place
in the commerce of the world. Such is the
character of the present tariff; avowedly and
designedly protective as well to our established
as to our infant manufactures, though in an
unequal degree. This, too, in harmony with
the entire legislation of the country from the
earliest period. For it should never be for-
gotten that on the 4th of July, 1789, our day
of happiest memory, was approved by George
Washington the second act ever passed by
the American Congress, introduced and sup-
ported in this House by Mr. Madison, with this
significant preamble:
" Whoreas it is necessary for tho sup port of Govern-
ment, for tho discharge of the debts of tho United
States, aad tho encouragement and protection of
manufactures, that duties be laid on goods, waree,
and merchandise imported."
Such was the recorded opinion of the fathers,
and such the uninterrupted practice now for
more than eighty years.
Mr. MARSHALL. I would like the gentle-
man from Tennessee [Mr. Maynakd] to state
the rate of duty per cent, of that tariff.
Mr. MAYNARD. The rate of duty was very
lew.
Mr. MARSHALL. It was about 8J per cent.
Mr. MAYNARD. Our importations then
were not large; and our necessities were but
small. Mr. Hamilton, in his report on tho
condition of the Treasury, contemplated rais-
ing $600,000 of annual revenue, of which
$100,000 was for pensions. Of course it was
not then necessary to impose a rate of duty
such as is now imposed, when, thanks to the
rebellion, we have a debt on our shoulders of
$2,500,000,000 and an interest to be paid
annually of $125,000,000.
But a duty of 8 per cent, to " encourage and
protect'' manufactures involves the same prin-
ciple as a duty of 80 per cent, or any other
rate of duty. Of course itis a matter of judg-
ment, ofdiscretion, of sound and wise states-
manship, what particular rate of duty shall be
imposed in each particular instance and on
each separate article. It is tho principle of
protection which we are speaking of and con-
tending for.
About nullification times there arose a grave
constitutional question, one of the unpleasant
things hatched from the heated and distem-
pered condition of public affairs. It was seri-
ously argued that it was unconstitutional to
impose duties for protection. Such was the
view of Mr. Calhoun, who argued very ably in
support of it, as he always did in support of
every thesis which he undertook to maintain,
although he had interposed no such objection
to tho passage of the tariff act of 1824, and had
with great zeal urged the passage of the act
of 1816. I should not now have referred to
this subject had not doubts been suggested,
though not pressed during this debate, of our
constitutional power to pass the bill. The re-
corded debates of the First Congress show that
the act of 1780 underwent a prolonged discus-
sion by the ablest men of that day. 1 he debate
took a wide range. The same objections were
urged and answered that have often been Urged
and answered since and will be again. I hat
there should be no mistake about the princi-
ples on which the act was passed they took
