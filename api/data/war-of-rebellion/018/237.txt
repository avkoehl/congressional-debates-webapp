HARPER'S FERRY, May 25, 1862-9 a. m.

(Received 9.30 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

One hundred and ninth and One hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania and First Maryland Cavalry are here. Five companies of the First District Regiment left here this morning. Tenth Maine joined General Banks last night at 11 p. m. No communication with General Banks this morning since 7 o'clock. Last dispatch stated our forces to be retreating from Winchester. Reports from prisoners and contrabands state the force to be Ewell's 6,000 strong, and an indefinite number of Johnson's being with him, which, if true, will be between 3,000 and 4,000 additional. Ewell has fourteen guns. All agree that enemy intend to attack Harper's Ferry. Many conflicting rumors. My impressions are that the entire force of Jackson, Ewell, and Johnson are acting in concert in this valley. One prisoner states that Jackson desired Ewell to march immediately from Front Royal to Winchester; to pay no attention to Banks. They approached Front Royal by three routes, viz: Chester Gap, Luray road, and Powell's Fort Valley. Enemy attacked scouts last night at Berryville with one company of cavalry. Reported that they are re-enforced this morning by 250 additional. The Maryland Cavalry are making preparations, and will march as soon as they can get ready.

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

Two trains just arrived from Martinsburg report the arrival of a body of Federal cavalry from Winchester, bringing the news of Banks' retreat toward Martinsburg, with orders to send all trains east and west from that point. Dispatch just received saying operator and all are leaving Martinsburg. Telegram from Adjutant Markell, Eighth New York Cavalry, from Charlestown, stating men just arrived there who had been guarding stores at Spencer [Stephenson's?] Station; that the rebels are pursuing our retreating forces to that point, viz, 9 miles beyond Charlestown. Heavy cannonading heard all the morning. No artillery here.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The Sixtieth reported to be at Sandy Hook. The One hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania gone on cars. Telegram from Charlestown, 7 miles, just received, reports all quiet 2 miles beyond that point, with no signs of the enemy. No telegraphic communication with Winchester. Shall join the One hundred and eleventh, and reach General Banks to-night if alive. Present appearances indicate somewhat that
