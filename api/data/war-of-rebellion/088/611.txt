Lawson will send them all to you. The commanding general wishes you to designate some rendezvous for them, and have rolls prepared as fast as they report, informing them that their pay and rations will commence from that time. I will telegraph Captain Wheeler to send all those from Beaufort and Morehead to you. The commanding general hopes that you will make such arrangements as will insure the presence of all when the time comes for them to go.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. JUDSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
