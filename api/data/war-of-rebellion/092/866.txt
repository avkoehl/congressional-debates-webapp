General Taylor telegraphs from Mobile that he may not, through accident on roads, reach Macon before Sherman's force. I am in same condition here. I therefore respectfully urge that General Hardee should be ordered to assume temporary command fort with of the troops operating in Georgia.

General S. COOPER:

General Cobb reports from Macon, November 17:

Enemy is advancing in two columns, by Griffin and McDonough, evidently moving on Macon. His force three corps, estimated at 30,000, including Kilpatrick's cavalry. We are falling back rapidly to this place. Enemy will probably be here Monday.

I have ordered Generals Hood and Taylor, and requested General Hardee, to send General Cobb all the re-enforcement they can spare. I have ordered General Taylor to Macon forthwith, and am going there in person rapidly as condition of roads will permit.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

General Hood reports from Florence, 18th:

Jackson's cavalry division could not be spared from this army without seriously embarrassing Stewart's operations, while General Wheeler has with him some thirteen brigades of cavalry.

I have suggested to General Hood, if he could not spare troops for Georgia, to take the offensive immediately to relieve it.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
