sure, to shelter the vital par-ts until the whole
should be completed From some misunderstand-
ing, without the knowledge 01 participation of the
Engineer Department, this mound was levelled
Earth has also been placed upon the parapet wall
These operations have proved mjunous to the
works, and immediate measures must be taken to
repair the evils they have produced In loading
the parapet it was found that the masomy was not
sufficiently dry and consolidated to beai the pies-
sure of the great superincumbent weight, and al-
thVgh) fr°m tacir original strength and sohc'ity,
the • ^Ú* have not jet sustained any material in-
jury, sUi'J ü 1S of a nature to call for pi ompt re-
pairs. I recommend, therefore, that propei mea
sures to proteo* 'his fort from a coup de ma n, to
which it is now SO evidently exposed as to invite
attack, be adopted without delay, together with the
necessary repairs to strengthen the existing work*.
From an examination of the state of the works at
the Rip Raps, it appears that the subsidence of the
artificial foundation of stone, on which it is in-
tended to erect Fort Calhoun, has not yet entirely
ceased, and orders have been given to replace the
mass of materials, collected for the completion of
the fort, upon the arches, in such a manner as to
render the subsidence uniform , and when this is
done it will be prudent to leave it ihere tot some
time longer before recommencing the w orks
The great difficulty which has been experienced
in fixing upon a suitable -itc for the new tort
ordered to be constructed on or ne ir the Arkansas
frontier, and m determining its piecise position,
has occasioned unusua! and unexpected delay in
the commencement ol the work The commis-
sioners appointed to make the selection, by my
predecessor, being military men, fixed upon a site
with a single eye to its military properties, win reus,
it is believed to have been the intention oí Congress
to erect a fortress which should seive as a refuge
for the border settlers, who are exposed, from their
situation, to the hostile incursions of the Indians,
and it became necessary to direct a subsequent
examination, in order to meei that object A board
of competent officers was accoidingly appointed,
and proceeded in the execution of this duty Then
report may be looked for dail), and the work will
be commenced as soon as the situation is fixed upon
by the Department
Prom a variety of causes not necessir\ f> re
capitulate here, but chicfH I rom > di-puic I title,
which has beenonl} recently decidid hi Ihe courts,
tfee land on which Port Delaware is situated has
not yet been acquired bv the Government The
Pea Patch island might have been purchased when
the fort was projected for comparatively a small
sum, and, since the commencement of its construc-
tion, was oflered to the United States for a slightly
advanced price- Since the decree in their lavor,
one hundred thousand dolíais, with interest fiom
that date, are asked for it by the proprietors, and it
remains to be decided whether this large sum shall
be paid for the land, or the wor! s be abandoned
The importance of having a I< rt up in this
island, in order to protect the harbor ol Phili
delphia, has been recognised b} every board of
military engineers that have examined the sub-
ject It is the lowest point at which, in connec-
tion with works upon the mam land, Philadelphia
is defensible, and, while it covers lhat haiboi,
Chester, and Newcastle, prevents an enemy from
finding shelter in Delaware ba}, securer the de-
bouche of an important link in the great inland
chain* of wateicommumcation—the Delaware and
Chesapeake canal, and co\ers the extensive pow-
der manufactories near Wilmington Tor these
reasons, it is important the United States should
possess it, but whether it is to be acquired at the
pnce now asked far it, or afler an equitable ap-
praisement of its real value, is a subject to be de-
cided by the wisdom of Congress In the mem
time, the works in progress there u ill render its
abandonment more costly hereafter, and maven
hance still further the value of the island An ear-
ly decision is therefore highly desirable
The ordnance corps, organized in 1R32, requires
some enlargement in order to lender it efficient
At present, there is not an officer to superintend
«üftéiseaal, and it appear  to me that the public
interest wih be promoted by the addition of two
majors and ten first lieutenants But, above all,
this branch of the service demands the creation,
by law, of a mixed bowl of artillery and ordnance,
to be composed of oflicers of rank and experience,
to digest a general sj stem of ordnance and small
arms for the use ot the United States Similar
boards have been lormed, from time to time, by
regulations of the War Department, but expe-
rience proves the necessity of some legal enact-
ment, to ensure the due performance of this im-
portant duty, for up to this time there exists no
geneial system, such as I propose, and such as is
absolutely necessary to place this branch of the
service on a level with that of othei countries, and
pi esciieit there
Doubts having been entertained by my prede-
cessoi m office of the power ot the Department to
enter into contracts for supplies oí cannon and
arms, w ithout pievious advertisement, it has be-
come the pric tiee ot the ordinance office to make
informal aiiansrements with the proprietors of
foiindues and linnufactoiies ol arms, to receive a
certain amount of cmnon and muskets on inspec-
tion at i settle 1 price, an engagement equally
binding as i wiitten contract on the put ot the
Depirtment, but unci nam m its obligation upon
the manufactuiei The fmmei method of con-
ti acting foi limited penods, is, in every respect,
preferable These establishments require expen-
sive preparations, and having no other market
than that afforded by the demand of Government,
ought to have some assurance of the articles they
ma\ manufacture being taken off their hand^ A
contract for a limited period gives this assurance,
enabling them to secure the most competent work-
me i, and encouraging them to render their midli-
ne rj is perf ct as possibV A iccenl opinion if
the Attomei General declares this method to be
legal, and it will be followed in lutnre unless pro-
hibited by legislative enactment The existence of
oor own armories enables the Government to esta-
blish a stindard of comparison to which the pri-
vate manufacturers are compelled to conform, and
secures the acquisition of good arms at equitable
puces With the satw view, the establishment of
a nitional foundn has been frequently urged, and
I bc¿ have, re pectfully, to repeat the iccommen-
dition It is not intended that this establishment
'henil I, at once iurm-h the amount of cannon and
pillee tiles required, but it would enable the Old-
nance Department to make the necessary trials
and experiments, so as to determine the proper
wiixluie of met lis to combine the greatest strength
with the greatest lightness, and produce the most
perfect model  This would secuie, at all times, a
sntlic ent snpp'y of the best Aims at fair prices
Intending to submit a plan by which the casting of
cannon and projectiles and the manufactory of
ginpowder shall be placed under the supervision
ot a joint board ol the united seivice of army and
navv, the proposed establishment will, if adopted,
be made useful to both branches of the service
The erection of a manufactory of small arms
west of Ihe Alleghany mountains cannot be too
strongly recommended The transportation of the
armament required by the western portion of our
Union is vei) expensive and ought to be avoided
It appears to me that the establishment best suit-
ed for that countiv is one for finishing, polishing,
and putting together, the several parts of the mus-
kets, to be made by individuals artisans, after
models furnished them by the superintendent, and
leceived on inspection In this manner the works
e in be eui tailed or extended to any amount that
may be required without inconvenience, and this
description of manufacture become familiar to a
1 irge cla s of mec names The buildings and fix-
tures, suitable for ims purpose, would be much less
expensive than those of the present national armo-
n-s, <ind, un' kc them the number of arms fabri-
cated mignt be increased tenfold without requiring
\, v addition to the original establishment This
armory m ght embiace the manufacture and in-
spection of rifles for the supply oí the friendly In-
dians, of \ihici numbers are now purchased an-
nualli
Disputes have arisen with persons who with-
held the rent lead due by them to the United States,
under the terms of a license to smelt lead ore
on lands belonging to Government; and, on lull
ronsideratwn of this subject, Í think it my duty to
state that, in my opinion, the reservations of the
lands m the lead region, and the plan now pursued
of collecting rent on their produce for the nse
of Government, whatever may have been its for-
mer advantages, is now prejudicial to that portion
of ¡he country where they are situated, and injuri-
ous to the interests it was intended to foster. Indi-
viduals will not engage m ex'ensive, systematic,
and costly works, such asare required in mining
opeiations, without some better security than a
meie license toi smelting ore. Nothing more is
elone, therefotc, than to scarify the surface of the
earth, and the mine is given up at a time when it
i íelds most ore, because its further exti action would
require in outlay not justified by the tenure ot the
land The miner then removes to anothei spot,
where the same process is followed, and the whole
i gion is dotted ovet with these imperfect and aban-
doned woriis Whereas, if these lands were brought
mlo market, to he sold at moderate prices, m small
tracts, to those who will actually settle there anil
w >rW the mines, they might be purchased by enter-
pnsing and industrious individuals, who would
erect permanent works, develop fully the mineral
lesoutce s of that region, and render iron and lead
so abundant and cheap, lhat Government would
be benefitted by the reduction in the price there of
articles of which it is so large a consumer, as well
as by the genet al impiovement of that portion of
the country. Por these reasons, it appears expe-
dient that authority be asked of Congress to dispose
of these lands, and also of ail ore banks and lands
containing minerals, of any description whatsoevei,
under the eontiol of the War Department
The ace nnpanying rep >rt of the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs coitainsa lull and lucid state-
ment of the vatious and important matters under
tne control of that office The complicated and
arduous duties of that branch 0t the War Depart-
ment have been performed m a manner highly cre-
ditable to the officers charged with their execution
but there are some important subjects connected
with these duties which require the early attention
c f Congress The Commissioner represents " that
the present system of disbursing, through the
agency of military officers, has proved inconve-
nient, in consequence of their frequent transfer to
other dfities," and it is, in my opinion, liable to
still stronger objections, as it imposes upon these
oflicers duties foreign to their professicn, and of
great responsibility, abstiacts them from their regi-
ments, and, not unfreqaently, unfits them to return
to them I would recommend that this method of
disbursing these funds be abandoned, and a suffi-
cient number of civil agents be appointed, so that
disbursements may be made by persons giving boncl
for the faithful discharge of their duties I concur
with the Commissioner in the propriety of provid-
ing by law for the more liberal compensation oí
agents and interpreters On their faithful execution
of th ■■ trusts reposed in them depends the success of
all iur efforts to civili/e the tribes and maintain the
peace of the frontiers, and the price now paid for
such important services is not equivalent to that re-
ceived by the same class^of persons in the employ-
ment of trading companies, whose mtei ests are not,
I am s( rry to say, identical with those of the Go-
vernment, and whose conduct too frequently coun-
teracts the humane policy of the United States to-
waids the Indians
In accordance with the opinion of the Commis-
s oner, I would lecommend the passage of a law
by which all sums accruing on moneys invested for
the use of the several Indian tribes be deposited in
the Treasury, to be drawn out upon the requisitions
of this department, m the usual form, and further,
that the whole busmen connected with the invest-
ment of the funds, for the interest of the Indians,
and the management thereof, be transferred from
this department to that of the Treasury, to which it
piopcrly belongs
Intelligence was received at this Department early
m the spring, that the Indians were in an unquiet
state on our northwestern frontier, and appre-
hensions were expressed that the hostile feelings
which existed between the Sioux and tne Sacs
