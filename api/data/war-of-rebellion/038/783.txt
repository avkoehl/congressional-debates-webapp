HDQRS. SECOND DIST., DEPT. MISS. AND EASTERN La.,Vicksburg, April 24, 1863.

Major R. W. MEMMINGER,

Asst. Adjt. General, DEPT. MISS. and Eastern La., Jackson:

MAJOR: In reply to the telegram of the lieutenant-general commanding, received last night, with regard to the movement of troops below, I have to state that every man has been taken from our right that should be, until further developments show that it cannot be attacked. There in no information in my possession which induces me to believe that the larger force is not above us. I respectfully submit my opinion that no re-enforcements be taken from Vicksburg for Grand Gulf until it is ascertained definitely that the main force of the enemy is opposed to it. The river is falling rapidly, and the country in our front will soon be out of water, when the entire line will be exposed. The line of defense here is over 20 miles, from Warrenton to lower works; Smith's two brigades, the city and part of right; and Forney's two brigades at Haynes', Snyder's, and Chickasaw Bayou.

If the enemy are well informed as to our positions, and I have no doubt that they are, they would attack right and left simultaneously. The Deer Creek and Sunflower country, from which we get our supplies, is now much more exposed than Upper Yazoo, and requires a considerable force to protect it.

I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON.

JACKSON, April 24, 1863.

Brigadier-General TILGHMAN, Canton, MISS.:

You will send one-half of your command, under a reliable officer, to intercept the enemy should he attempt to retreat by Carthage. You will employ active citizens, well mounted, provided you cannot furnish them, to act as scouts, and to keep you advised of his movements.

JACKSON, April 24, 1863.

Brigadier-General TILGHMAN, Canton:

You will can in the FIFTIETH Alabama Regiment. Also order Major Cummins to fall back to Canton. If General Featherston should call for a battery, you will send the one you have.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 24, 1863.

Brigadier-General TILGHMAN, Canton:

Mount the Kentucky regiment, but do not send it to Carthage, but draw in your other regiment to Canton. Keep out scouts, and if you find enemy approaching points named by you, you can move by railroad more rapidly than he can. I have no troops now here to send up the road.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
