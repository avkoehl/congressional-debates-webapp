flashes of Ilia divine eloquence, he paused in one
of his loftiest flights, and, casting his eyes up-

celestial world, exclaimed: "Father Abraham,
whom have you in Heaven? Have you any Meth-
odists there?" "No." "AnyBaptists?" "No."
"Any Presbyterians?" "No." "Any Episco-
palians?" "No." "Whom have you there?"
"Nobody but Christians," was the patriarch's
reply. So, when it shall be inquired of the great
leader of the Democratic hosts, in the approaching

Breckinridge men?" "No." "AnyGuTimiB

" Whom have you,then ?" " Nobody but Dem-

be."
