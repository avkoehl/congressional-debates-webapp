THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
159
It may be that this provision of the Constitution
was never discussed in re'ation to this subject, and
consequently never acted on Ii neither an exam-
ination nor discussion has been had on this part
of the Constitution, the pievailing practice of bal-
loung should not receive much consideiation fiom
its ant quity—" an ancient erroi cannot make a
modern right "
The object and meaning of the Constitution
was to give publicity to the proceedings in Con
grels, and as all elections were questions in which
the people were interested, the conclusion is irre
sistible, under the provisions of the Constitution,
that the proceedings in all elections should be
dido toce, and published to the world in the Jour-
nals
It cannot be seriously contended that under the
Constitution the veas and nays ought to be used
¡iteially in an election, but even this could be
done 1 he candidate proposed foi office could be
voted for m this language The voter could say
yea or nay to him And one fifth of the membeis
piesent may requne u
But independent of the express provision of the
Constitution, and independent of the "¡pint and
meanmgof that instrument, Mr R obsei ved that
this proposition was of such a character, ausmg
from our republican institutions, that it is almost
as suscep ible of demonstration as any mathemat-
ic 1 problem
In this Republic the supreme power rests with
the people, under such rules and regulations as
are prescribed in our constitutions and laws I ne
people ate soveieign, and of right mast be, while
our GrovemtYient continues to exist as a Republic
No tyrant or irresi onsible loid or represéntate e
can rule over us The people ale lesponsible for
their acts to no earthly povvei, while they remain
within the pale of the Constitution and the law of
the land
This principle needs no demonstration to an
American It is self evident to every republican,
and I hope 1 address such
Arising out of this principle the system of
repiesentation must of necessity be adopted.
It would be folly to suppose that all the people
of this widely extended Republic could assemble
together to provide for their various wants, and to
transact their public business If they weie pres-
ent, they could not do any business, as the body
would be so unwieUy Hence resulted the rer>-
resentative foi m and principle in our Government !
It is the great improvement in governments which
gives the modern the great superiority over the
ancient Republics. Tnis is the principle, above
all others m our Government, which should be
preserved puie and sacred Any intervening cir-
cumstance, althougn trivial in itself, that tends to
injure the punty of elections, or the puiity of the
representative principle, should be condemned as
dangerous to our liberties
Judging from the experience of a few years past,
Mr R said he had arrived at the conclusion that
the people of the United States are determined,
at all hazards, to preserve the purity of elections
Thisis the greatest evidence of the vigor, strength,
and long life of our Government
Next m the order of/events is the responsibility
of the Representative to his constituents This is
as important, and, in fact, as necessary to becher- I
ished and preseived in its purity, as the elective
franchise It is a yoke fellow, one will not exist
in Mgorwhen the other is in decay and rotteniaess
They will both rise or fall together, as they both
stand on the same political giound
A moment's leflection will satisfy all of the ne-
cessity of the le^ponsibihly of the Representative
to his constituents The very name will show that
he is not acting for himself in his official capacity
He acts for others, and to them he is responsible
for his official conduct He should be the minor,
to exhibit the sentiments of his people, and, in
fact, the miniature picture of the people
Although I am at a great distance fiom my con-
stituents, and perhaps not one of them will wit-
ness any of my official conduct, yet I cons.der
myself bound, by the nature of my office, and by
my own feelings also, to represent in this House
the will and sentiments of the people of the First
Congressional District in the State of Illinois
Should I disregard their republican sentiments on
the subject now before the House, and vote to
hide my vote fiom their examination, 1 would he
taught a lesson, through ¡he medium of the ballot-
box at home, which v,ould be a warning to me on
all tuture occasions This, I think, would be my
lot     1 judge not foi others
This pnnciple being established, that the repre-
sentaave is bound to represent the sentiments of
his constituents, liuly ami hqnestly, and that he is
responsible for the same, the question then anses,
how is this fact to be ascertained '
The proposition now before the House, is noth-
ing moie or less than to require the best evidence
to ascertain the responsibility of the representa-
tive of which the naiuie of the case is susceptible
lilis is the common sense, and, I may add, the
common Jaw rule of evidence m our courts of jus-
tice. And should it not be extended also to trans
actions in the most high and august ti ibunal in tlie
nation ' The lecord evidence ot each individual's
vote on the J miual is the mode the best calculated
to exhibit to the people the acts of their lepre-
sentatives
This is the mode pointed out by the Constitution,
and it is found by expeuenee to be the best man-
ner to preserve the histoiy of any tiansact on in
courts of justice,*oi in legislative bodies It is
much the best for the memoer himself There
can be no perversion of his vote, if it be recorded,
as it falls from his mouth His constituents and
the world, if they please, will know how he acts
Mi R said he was satisfied that there was no
peison in this House, who would want to hide
ins vote on any pxibiic transaction
The people, as they aj esoveieign and not respons-
ible to tne íepresenlatives oi to anybody, have
the right to vote as they please, by ballot oi other-
wise I he ballot system is the best for the people,
and the tiua noce for the public seivnnts
it is idle to con end that the Constitution requires
the record of the proceedings and votas of mem
beis oi measures, to be reconled, and not on men,
n elections On measuies, one filth of the mem
bers can require the votes to be iccorded, and on
elections for men to office, the same rule and prin
ciple should be applied They are both within
the meamni and letter of the Constitution
Mr McKllNLLYdid not consider it a matterof
the leastconseq tence, so far as this resolution was
concerned, whether the printer to this House be
regaided as an officer of the House, oi one bound
by contiact to perform a pamculai  duty     The
joint resolution of 1819 could have no influence
upon the mere question of election or appointment
of printer, because that part of it which directed
that the printer to etch  House should be elected
by bal'ot, was temporary, and expired with the
first election under it     The residue of the resolu-,
Hon, which regulates the duties of the printers, is I
still in force    The joint resolution of 1829, is the ,
law regulating the election of pnnteis, by it there |
is no mode of election prescribed, consequently
there is no law of Congress requiring that the
election of public punter shall be by ballot
But, sir, if there was such a law, it could have
no weight in a case like this The Constitution
confers the power on each House, to determine the
rules of its own pioceedmgs That part of the
resolution of 1819, which dnects that the pnnteis
shall be elected by ballot, does nothing more than
prescribe the rule of proceeding in the election,
therefore, is not obligatory on either House longer
than either chooses to confoim to it There is
nothing, therefore, in the resolution of 1819, if it
were m force, which could, or ought to, restrain
this House from adopting the resolution under
consideration Sir, I deem it unnecessary to fol-
low the argument of the gentleman from New
York [Mr Fillmore] further upon this part of
the subject The resolution under consideration,
is one of great importance, in principle, it pro-
poses that the vote of each member of this House
shall be entered upon the Journal in every election,
and thereby promotes the great and leading prin-
ciple of the Government—the responsibility of the
representative to his constituents In doing this, it
conforms to the spirit and intention of the Consti-
tution Why should any gentleman desire to con-
ceal his vote, or to shield himself fromjust accoun-
tability, upon this, more than any other subject
Upon all other questions it is admitted that one
fifth of the membeis present can compel each
member to iote t o voce, and have his vote re-
corded in the Journal Are elections exempted,
in any way, fiom the influence oí this rule' Is
there any íeuson why they should be' The con-
stitutional rule is broad enough to cover eveiy case
that can come before either House. It is in these
word* " Each House shall keep a Journal of its
'proceedings, and from time to lime publish the
' same, excepting such pans as may, in their judg-
' mem, i quite secrecy, and the yeas and nays of
'tne membeis of either House on any question,
'shall, at thedesneof one fifth of those present,
' be enteied on the Journal "
Su, is not an election & piocerdmg which is,and
ought to be, entered on the Journal^ If so, any
quemón aiismg in the eouuse of that proceeding
may be so entered, or then is no virtue in the rule.
There is no piovision of the Constitution more
piactisid under by this House—none so well cal-
culated to keep the people mfoimed of the pro-
ceedings of Congress, and the motives of its mem-
bers, why then should they not have the full
I benefit of it in elections as m other cases' It does
appear to me to be utterly impossible to escape
from the obtigatmy form of this provision m this
or any other case The proposition hrieis, that
a majority of this House, by passing the íesolu-
tion under discussion, may compel all the mem-
bers voting upon a question of election to have
then votes entered on the Journal The const!
tutional rule is, that one fifth of those present may
do so, and yet gentlemen say this lesolution ought
not to pass
Why was this provision inseited in the Con-
stitution ' Was it not to enable the people to see
who sustained and who opposed any particular
measure' This, sir, is the living pnnciple of
this Jovernment, without it the liberties of the
country could not be preserved We see efforts
making daily, on the part of the representative, to
shake-oft all responsibility, and to put at defiance
the populsr will Let it now be established by
the voie of this House, that we are not bound to
lecoid our votes in the election of officers, or on
any other question, and the boldest step towards
lnesponsible power evei yet taken in this Govern-
ment will have been, so fai, established Is there
any exception to the rule laid down in the Consti-
tution ' If elections of officers, the election or
appointment of printers, or any other act, or
thing to Le done by this House, is excepted, let
the exception be shown There is just as much
danger from the exercise of lnesponsible power
in the election of officers of the two Houses of
Congiess.asm innumerable other cases, occurring •
daily, in which the yeas and nays are requned
Youi Clerk disburses annually more than one hun-
dí ed and fifty thousand dollars—has the custody
of the papers and journals of the House The
Speakei presides over the deliberations of this
House—appoints the committees—examines and
conects the Journal—preserves order and deco-
rum—decides questions of order, and m virtue of
his office, may be President of the United States
And have the people no interest m the appoint-
ment of these officers' It is strange if they have
not Should a woithless individual be appointed
to either of these offices, and any signal failure of
duty occur, we should hear the inquiiy—who
voted for him '—by which party was he elected'
But under the existing rules of this House these
would be unavailing questions—secrets which the
people could not know, and which gentlemen say
they ought not to know
The framers of the Constitution did not put it
in the power of a bare majority of either House
to suppress or exclude from the Journals the vote
upon any question whatever, but to effect that
object they required that more than four fifths of
those present.should concur This ¡shows the
jealous apprehensions entertained by those pat-
riots It shows that they foresaw that the repre-
sentatives would be disposed to conceal their pro-
ceedings and to avoid responsibility, and fearing
the combinations of interested members, and the
failure of public virtue, they put in the power of
one fifth of those present to coerce the remaining
four fifths, and compel them to record their votes
for the information of the people And is th's
essential  provision  of the  Constitution  to be
