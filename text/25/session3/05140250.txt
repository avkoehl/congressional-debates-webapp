APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 24,
25th Gong....3d Sess.
by which our Union was governed for nearly
thirty years. Prior to the late war with Great
Britain, our tariffs were revised and our taxes
levied to supply the actual wants of Government,,
however they might operate, incidentally, on the
internal industry of the country. It was never
then designed to raise more revenue than was
actually necessary to supply our Federal wants.
During the war, large investments were made by
our capitalists in manufactures; and when it was
over, the principle of our revenue laws was en-
tirely reversed. Our taxes were no longer gradu-
ated by the wants of Government, but by the
demands of our capitalists for protection; thus
substituting the incident for the principal. Our
tariffs Were revised without any regard to the con-
dition of our finances, and a broad foundation was
laid for a redundant revenue. The consequence
was a- rapid extinguishment of a public debt,
funded and unfunded, of$150,000,000. Antici-
pating this redemption, appropriations in every
branch of the public service were increased; and
still more extensively to absorb a prospective sur-
plus, new objects of expenditure were soughtfor,
which had been before considered under the ju-
risdiction of the States. Surveys were author-
ized, laying the foundation for a Federal system
of roads, canals, harbors, and other improve-
ments, sufficient to exhaust any surplus which
might possibly occur. Extravagance was deemed
patriotic, as designed to perpetuate protection to
manufactures. The one was indispensable to the
other; and, for a time, the rights of the tax-payer
were wholly disregarded.
This attempt to interfere with the rights of the
States, and to enlarge Federal jurisdiction, ex-
penditure, and patronage, was partially arrested
at an early stage, by leaving to the States the ex-
clusive and constitutional control over their roads
and canals. But there still remained other ex-
penditures.which will be noticed hereafter, equally
foreign, as the committee think, to the legitimate
duties of a confederated Government. But, not-
withstanding these, the extravagant tendency of
a surplus, and the rapid redemption of our public
debt, we have been already compelled to deposit
eight-and-twenty millions with the States. For-
tunately, however, this association of protection,
surplus, and extravagance, is no longer the policy
of our Government. Both Houses, by over-
whelming majorities, revived ourancient principle
of revenue in the act of 2d of March, 1833. The
fourth clause of the third section of that act pro-
vides that after the 30th of June, 1842, "duties
shall be laid for the purpose of raising such rev-
enue as may be necessary to an economical ad-
ministration of the Government." Believing, as
the committee do, that no other policy can be
permanently sustained in a confederacy of inde-
pendent States, they deem it expedient to examine
our expenditures in detail, to ascertain what re-
forms can be introduced to bring them down to
the economical standard permanently contem-
plated by the act of 1833.
Before noticing the permanent expenditures of
the Government, it is proper to advert to those
of an occasional or temporary character, which
have very largely and unavoidably increased the
amount of our annual appropriations for a few
years past; these are in the Indian branch of the
public service. The expenditures for Indian
lands and wars have amounted, within a few
years past, to about fifty million dollars. The
purchase of their lands, and the removal of the
Indians beyondthe Mississippi, were unavoidably
connected with the settlement of the country,
however it might affect the various tribes. It is
satisfactory to know that their condition has been
ameliorated by removal. The addition of thirteen
new States to the Onion, embracing within their
boundaries.most of these tribes, made it necessary,
especially in latter years, to purchase their lands,
in order to advance civilization; to remove obvi-
ous obstructions to the settlement and cultivation
of the country; to prevent collision, and to pre-
serve the lives and property of the inhabitants of
our States and Territories from Indian depreda-
tions. These purchases have also been founded,
almost exclusively, upon compacts formed with
some States more than thirty years ago; on our
implied obligation to other States; and on-réáola'-
Beporton the state of the Tretísuñp, Sfc:
ticms and appropriations by both Houses of Con--
gress, extending through every Administration of
the Government. They were, moreover, justifi-
able on mere financial grounds. By referring to
the documents annexed, it will be seen that we
have acquired by Indian treaties, since the 4th of
March, 1829, about one hundred and ten million
acres; There now-remain, of unbought Indian
lands, less than thirty-five million acres. No ex-
traordinary expenditure can, therefore, be here-
after anticipated for this object; nor is it proba-
ble that there will be such extravagant demands
upon the Treasury for Indian wars, owing to the
removal of almost all the tribes, and to a change
in the plan of operations in Florida, but princi-
Eally to the recent increase of the Army. One
alfof the amount expended in these wars has
undoubtedly arisen from the extraordinary ex-
penses arising from suddenly calling into the field
numerous bodies of militia and volunteers, which
we were obliged to do in consequence of the in-
adequate force of the regular army. The increase
of that force will enable Government, in some
degree, to dispense with these calls in future; and
many millions in our annual expenditures will
be saved by preventing Ihdian depredations, and
promptly suppressing them when they may
occur.
Owing to appropriations of the character re-
ferred to, and to others which will be noticed,
there is a very considerable apparent increase of
the Federal expenditures in the last ten years.
The appropriations for 1828, including those un-
der permanent acts, amounted to about thirty-
eight million dollars. In comparing these with
the expenditures in 1829, the following items
will be found in the former which were not in the
latter:
For preventing and suppressing Indian hostilities,$l ,000,000
For the same, and for the Cherokee treaty......6,740,000
For removal of Indians, annuities, &c,$3,060,000

cipally in the following:

Our naval and military expenses have been
greater since 1829; the former owing, in part, to
the uncertainty, atone time, of our relations with
France, and the latter to Indian wars. But our
expenditures Have been since then increased in
every branch by an augmentation of the amount
of commercial credit, which adds to the cost of
all our supplies.
In examining into our expenditures there will
be found, in many of them, much abuse requiring
reform. Two branches do not come annually
under the consideration of Congress—the expend-
itures for the Post Office service and the expenses
of collecting our revenue. The former, not be-
ing a charge upon the public Treasury, (except
Ho. of Reps.
for the expenses of the General Post Office,) are
regulated by the ineorae-from postages, which are.
annually increasing the number of our routes and
the frequency of the transportation of the mails.
Of the immense increase in this branch of, the
public service, some idea may be formed from the
increase in the transportation of the mails. It
was not, probably, more than 100,000 miles in
1790; 845,468 in 1793; as late as 1803 it was but
3,504,800; it is now. 34,580,202 miles. Though
not a charge upon the public Treasury, we are
bound, ás the trustee of the fund, to see that it is
administered with economy, in order that our
mail routes may be extended to the remotest
quarters of the Union. It has been, accordingly,
the subject of investigation; the Department has
been reorganized, and it is believed now to be
well administered. There is charged upon this
fund, for the service of the present year.f 5,100,000.
If it is designed that this important establishment
should support itself, there seems to-be no reason
for discriminating between the expenditures for
the offices throughout the Union and of the Gen^
eral Post Office by charging the former upon the
fund of the Department and the latter upon the
Treasury.
The expense of collecting our revenue from
customs amounted, in the first ten years after
1789, to about two hundred and ninety-three thou-
sand dollars annually; for the last ten, ending
31st December, 1837, to $1,232,000; it is now
about a million and a half. By referring to the
table of tonnage, it will be seen that the amount
of tonnage entered from abroad has increased
from six hundred and five thousand tons in 1790
to two million sixty-five thousand tons in 1837.
The expenses of collecting the revenue was, in
1829, $1,013,000, and, in 1837, $1,492,000. The
tonnage entered from abroad was one million
three thousand in 1829, and two million sixty-five
thousand tons in 1837. The annual amount of
revenue is no criterion of the expense of collection;
because, although we have relinquished the duty
on more than half of our importations, the great
increase in this branch of trade creates a necessity
for an increased number of inspectors. We have
also, of late years, introduced many very com-
plicated provisions in our tariff laws, and added
to the expense of collection. But a part of this
increase is owing to the neglect of Congress in not
limiting, from time to time, the number of officers
to be employed; and in permitting the collectors
to pay the whole expense of our custom-houses
out of the revenue received, without even trans-
ferring it to the public Treasury. Had Congress
periodically limited the number of our officers,
directed the collectors to pay all the money re-
ceived by them into the Treasury, required annual
estimates, and made specific appropriations for
"this, as in other branches of the public service, it
would have operated as a sensible check on the
extravagance of some of our collectors.
Although the subject of tonnage is only indi-
rectly connected with the question of expenditures,
the committee cannot dismiss it without calling
the attention of the House to the fact disclosed in
the table annexed, that while the American ton-
nage entered from abroad increased from 872,949
in 1829, to 1,299,720 tons in 1837, the foreign
tonnage rose from 130,743 to 765,703 tons in the
same period—a result owing, among other causes,
to our unwise taxes on navigation, and to an abuse
of credit at home, which enables foreign nations
to build, supply, and man their ships cheaper
than we can, and slowly to undermine the basis
of our naval power.
The legislative expenses of the Federal Gov-
ernment for the first ten years were annually, on
an average, about $171,000; the appropriations
for the year 1838 were $982,000. A part of this
has arisen from the increase in the number of
members of Congress; but the most extravagant
increase has occurred in the contingent expenses
of both Houses. In the first ten years these
did not amount to more than $10,000 annually;
while the appropriations for the past year were
$373,960. Although under the immediate obser-
vation and exclusive control of Congress, there
is no branch of the public service where there has
been more abuse and extravagance. Thousands
