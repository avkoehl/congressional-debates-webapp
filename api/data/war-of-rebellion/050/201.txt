Advices from Burnside received this morning. He was at Carter's Depot 23rd; had defeated rebels there and burned bridge. Was about to move hitherward with whole available force. Will probably get here about Wednesday next week.

No change of importance. Rebels still remain in Chattanooga Valley; report they had withdrawn erroneous. Telegraph cut today between here and Bridgeport. New line ordered on north side Tennessee.

CHATTANOOGA, September 26-10 a.m.

Enemy pushed forward his pickets on our left at 5 a.m. to-day, driving in ours. Sharp skirmish ensued, rebels being driven at 6.30. General Palmer received severe flesh wound while standing in embrasure of one of our forts. Our loss otherwise inconsiderable. We took several prisoners from Breckinridge's division, who report the main rebel force encamped along Missionary Ridge. We have reports that rebel cavalry have appeared in Lookout Valley, threatening Bridgeport, but other evidence contradict them. [Rosecrans] is about to lay a bridge across Tennessee at mouth of Lookout Creek, so that he can operate from here in that valley without crossing the mountain. Weather bright, cool, pleasant.

This feeling is universal among them, including men like Major-Generals Palmer and Sheridan and Brigadier-Generals Wood, Johnson, and Hazen. What is the senti-
