is very necessary that a sufficient force should be kept here, or everything movable here will be sacrificed. General, please excuse this lengthy letter. I could state much that you should know, but will close for the present.

Yours, most respectfully,

JOHN F. IJAMS,

Major, Comdg. Fifth Independent Battn., Ohio Vol. Cavalry.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 12, 1863-1.30 p.m.

Major General S. A. HURLBUT,

Or Army Officer at Memphis, Tenn.:

It is reported that a court organized by the provost-marshall at Memphis has taken jurisdiction of a claim of certain creditors in Columbus, Ohio, against Orgill Brothers. Such a court can have no jurisdiction of the class of cases mentioned, and the Secretary of War directs that army proceedings of a civil nature which may have been had therein to Messrs. Orgill's detriment be annulled and set aside. You will order the Court to discontinue all proceedings of this character.

Brig. General E. A. CARR,

If you are out of provisions at La Grange, draw from Corinth by return trains.

Forage must go forward from here, and our stock of rations is out until a boat comes from above.

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, October 12, 1863.

General HURLBUT:

I am here with one brigade (1,000) and a battery. Sweeny left a point 7 miles south of here at 4 this a.m., going toward Hudsonville; says he will recapture Sherman. His cavalry is somewhat scattered; does not know where Colonel Hatch is; says Phillips will co-operate with him from Coldwater. Hatch is probably south and west of Salem. Phillips, with brigade, is probably west of Sweeny and in communication with him. Regular train which was stopped yesterday going west will leave here on time to-day for Memphis followed by those which were behind i yesterday unless other orders. No other trains on road to my knowledge.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
