provement now of less value, because not directly
connected with the others — as much more im-
portant and useful as are the great rivers of the
West more valuable than thty would be were
they separate ind disconnected streams, and the
navigation confined on each to their own chan-
nel"
Your magnificent lakes and beautiful rivers
must forever continue your commetcial avenues
Your canals, which bisect the country between,
will communicate with the commercial interior;
but the ease and speed of railroads give them
unquestionable preference for all traveling pur-
poses, and all experience has shown that for
commercial purposes they are incomparably su-
perior to the bt st macadamized roads. Animal
power for draft, much less for speed, can never
compete with steam, which is unlimited in its
abilitj , and never tires. Not many years ago
the ked-boat was mnde to stem the rapid current
of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers by manual
power, then a trip to New Oileans was a voyage
of three months The first introduction of steam-
boats greatly lessened the time and labor; the
time, undt r the advancing improvements, is re-
duced much further, but every traveler who has
been upon a railroad knows that the time may be
yet reduced one half.
He viewed the determination of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company to persevere in their
prosecution of that work to the Ohio river as a
most propitious event to the West He should
feel that he had been recreant to the interests of
the West were he not to embrace this occasion
to express these sentiments. And he believed
the West would be unpardonably negligent to
her interests if the earliest opportunity be not
embraced to secure the termination of that road
at such a point as will be suitable for the termin-
ation of the great railroad avenue of the West,
that the two may complete the rapid and cheap
communications between the East and the West
Each of these great works east and west will add
incalculably to the value of the other; they are
inseparable parts of a great and essential whole,
and surely the different sections so deeply inter-
ested w ill not let the available period pass without
securing their junction, and the completion of
both He entei tamed an earnest hope that they
■would" not.
Let this railroad be completed from the Ohio
to the Mississippi, and to the farthest west, and
it will greatly advance all the interior towns and
villages between yourcanalsand rivers—willform
a much more valuable channel of communication
for commercial purposes than any other road to
forward the productions of the interior to their
destined markets, and receive in return whatever
the necessities of the country require     It will
brins: them substantially as much nearer to the
canals and rivers, and to each other, as the time
and expense of travel and transportation are re-
duced     It will cross  the  great projected  way
between  Lake  Erie,  by way of Cincinnati, to
Chaileston.and will cross the projected railways
of Indiana and Illinois, and will render them all
more valuable to those who construct them and to
the country, by gathering the current of travel as
it com. s from the East, and distributing it again
through these diverging channels to the interior
and to the remotest regions of the West, and it
would invite an immense travel east waid through
these roads, which must otherwise pass to the
east by way of the Ohio river or the lakes; and it
would present a most successful competition to
the steamboats on the Ohio, between Cincinnati,
by way of the projected Lake Erie railway to its
intersection, and the termination of the Baltimore
and Ohio railway, for the distance mty be trav-
eled in less than half the time, and between St
Louis and that point the time of travel would be
reduced at least three fouiths; and between the
mouth of the Ohio and Wheeling, by way of the
Illinois Central railway, to intercept the great
western railway at Vandalia, it would compete
most triumphantly with the steamboat travel, for
U could be traveled in   about one  third of the
time, and probably safer and cheaper, and at all
seasons of the year when the stage of water is
unfavorable in the river, particularly during the
low water in the summer and the ice in the win-
ter, which so often render extremely difficult, and
frequently entirely interrupt, the navigation in the
upper Ohio If the time was the same, this would
be an invaluable substitute, but when it is known
that the time is reduced seveial days in the trip,
compared with the most favorable stages of the
river, it would be preferred by all business men,
to whom time is more valuable than money. It
would be seen by all, and he could not doubt that
the people of Illinois would see it so, that this
road, m this view, receiving and transmitting the
immense travel of Missouu, Tennessee, Missis-
sippi, Alabama, and the whole southwestern
country, that travel to and from the East through
the southern section of the Illinois Central i ail-
way, would add incalculably to the value and
interest of that road, and would diveit a large
portion of that immense travel that is now con-
fined to the Ohio liver, through the States of
Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio
To those who have not kept pace with the im-
provements of the most •eventful times, and to
those who have not enjoyed  the ease and wit-
nessed the facilities of railways, this picture may
appear too high  wrought      But all who have
traveled upon any of the railways of this country
will readily admit its practicability     He knew
he had not stated all that may be, and, in his
sober judgment, would be, accomplished before
many yeais in the rapid progiess of western en-
terprise.    He had himself tiaveled at a greater
speed than twenty miles per hour, he had trav-
eled  twenty continuous  miles in less   than   an
hour over a track not so well adapted to great
speed as that now projected. To him these objects
were too desirable in his view, and of too much
value to his country, to let any proper occasion
pass without presenting them for public consid-
eration, and pressing their early accomplishment.
Every person the least observant of the prog-
ress of events in this country has seen with pleas-
ure that the whole system of traveling, through-
out  this  country, has  undergone  a great  and
important revolution within the last four years.
This has been effected by the application of steam
to boats, the construction of railroads and steam
locomotives, and by the general introduction of
stages and extension of stage lines, to connect all
the important points of the country    It is within
the recollection of those present, when the citi-
zens of the Atlantic cities traveled from one city
to the othei  in their own puvate cainage,and
when the tedious journey fiom the West could
only be performed with great fatigue on horse-
back     No one thinks now of making a journey
in this style.    He who would  attempt it would
be laughed at as unfashionable and eccentric, as
one who neither consulted his ease, his economy,
nor his leisuie     A private carriage,or a travelei
on horseback, is seldom met on any of your great
traveling thoioughfaies     This íesults fiom the
great facilities of traveling to any desired  point
faster and cheaper by other means     And as the
numbcrof contiguous lines of stages, steamboats,
and railways, is increased, each adds to the im-
portance, and increases the business, of the other
This was the boasted age of inventions, the hand
of improvement was seen, and its influence felt,
cveiywhere  advancing   the   interests  and  pio-
moting the happiness of society     Laboi saving
machines were applied to increase the power and
i educe the laboi of men in each opeiation and
every department of life; and in no attempt have
these efforts been more successful than in then
application to the means of traveling.
The general adoption of railways will accom-
plish all that is desirable, and viewed in this light,
the connection of the great eastern and western
I sections of the Union by a railway is of the
utmost importance The improved mode and
I increased facilities of intercommunication are
among the prominent events which characterize
this age. To that immense multitude who travel
between the East and West, time is money, and
the time that would be saved, without estimating
the fatigue between a railway and a macadamized
road, would be several days to each passenger
This economy of time would in a shoit period
equal the construction of the road. The ease of
the traveling public would be piomoted, and the
ability of the business community is increased.
He had made an cffoit to collect a series of sta-
tistical items relative to that country to elucidate
this subject; but Tn a country so new, so vast,
and so extraordmai y in all that relxtes to it,
nothing satisfactory or even appioaching the tiuth
could be gatnered What was coirect of it to-
day fell far behind the tiuth on to-monow. Such
was the rapidity of its growth in improverm nt,
population, wealth,and business íesources. Like
the current of its mighty rivus, its course was
rapid, nresistible, onwaid.
A few yeais ago a journey over the best roads
in the country of time hundred miles, was one
of many days and of gieat tnal. Now it may
be performed in a single day, and compir-uivcly
without fatigue A journey acioss the AlKgha-
nics and tluough the valley of the West lequired
foimal prepaiation and the toil of weeks or
months The traveler took solemn leave of his
family and relatives The unforeseen incidents
and unavoidable perils of the journey were the
constant theme of his anxious friends. Complete
these roads, and a trip fiom New York to the
Ohio river may be performed in two days, and
to the Mississippi in four. And in point of time
and foi all practical purposes, St. Louis will be
brought as near to New York as Baltimore wis
twenty yeais ago; and eveiyother point in the
West, in time and labor, is biought as n uch
nearer Is not the accomplishment of all this
most desirable to the West' And will not the
East, who will share so laigely in its advantages,
aid in its accomplishment!1 Every individual
interested in the canals and raihoads, or in the
piospeuty of the commerce or towns of the West
—eveiy meichant or tradei who travels to the
East—every farmei whose agucultuial products
are sent to the East—every individual wlio navels,
has a common interest in the accomplishment of
this work They have only to lefl ct upon its
immense advantages to eveiy interest, to per-
ceive them and advocate them. Let the attention
of the people of the West be dnected to it, and
they will not fail to approve of it, and to instruct
their Representatives to secuie their interests;
nor will they hold him faultless who withholds
his cooperation
He believed the social and political influence
which would result from the increasing facilities
of intercommunication would be happily felt on
the character and destiny of the American peo-
ple As the time, labor, and expense of traveling
were lessened,greater inducements were held out
to the man of ease, and the mnn of industry, to
I travel, as well as to the man of business and the
man of leisure. As the time and expense weie
reduced, more fiequent journeys of friendship
and trips of pleasuie would be made—social feel-
ing promoted, society impioved, and a moie
genial feeling exist, and intimate connection be
foimed between the citizens of the different sec-
tions of the Union. To the Hue pituot, to the
aident lovei of his country, a^ to the true fnend
i of the Union, the rapidly-t xtending lines of mail
stages, the constiuction of canals and railways
through every part of the countiy, the ímorove-
ment of steamboat navigation upon nil your
lakes and rivers, furnish the strongest and most
conclusive evidence that this union will be per-
petual They bring, within a few days' travel,
the most distant paits of this wide spread Repub-
lic, improve their social feelings, sotien and
subdue their prejudices, unite then commeri lal
interests, and foim the sinews and ligaments
which must forever and ímepaiably bind and
cement them into one common and united people.
And as military defense s, the facilities with which
any required amount of men, mihtai y stores and
aims may be concentiated through them, at any
' given point, give to the assailaüle points of the
country the most confident security against any
successful invasion.
And since it has become the settled policy of
I the Government to remove and congregate all the
Indian tubes on the northwestern frontier, it is a
subiect worth v of grave and deliberate consider-
ation whether a railway on the line undei consid-
eiation, and extended beyond the Mississippi to
the Indian teintory, would not turnish the most
available and certain means of that kind of fre-
1 quent communication and rapid supply of foice
to control and keep in pioper check that wild and
lawless people
He did not understand it to be the desire of the
