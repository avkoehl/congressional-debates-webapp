the militia, to have as many more in addition on Cole's arrival. Cole has also one piece of artillery with him, the detachment of the Second Missouri Artillery, and the convalescents sent from Saint Louis. I will, with your approbation, direct this force of cavalry and the piece of artillery, under Cole to pursue the rebels. The convalescents, and other footmen with Cole, are unfit for such service.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 10, 1863

Lieutenant Colonel N. COLE,

Second Missouri Artillery, Commanding Troops, Lookout Station:

The cavalry should be certainly by this hour at Lookout. I prefer that you move with caution. Your command is too important to allow of any risks, and there is a great deal if you run your train at night, where it is possible the enemy may be watching for you. Let your cavalry flank your movement, and keep your troops carefully on the watch. Let me hear from you when you get to California.

JAS. TOTTEN.

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO.,

October 10, 1863-7 p.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

McKissock, general superintendent of the railroad, reached California from Sedalia on horseback; reports he saw La Mine Bridge and station-house there burned last night. Rebels are in possession of Tipton. Cole will be in California to-night, and his force, when joined by militia there, will number nearly 800 men. I sent with him all I could spare. I will give you the earliest information I can get regarding movements of rebels. Crittenden leaves at 10 o'clock to-night with 75 men.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 10, 1863-10 p.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN, Jefferson City:

If Cole finds the enemy scattered so that he can act effectively with his small force of cavalry and artillery, let him join in the pursuit. Some of them will doubtless attempt to escape across the Osage, below Linn Creek; perhaps at Tuscumbia. Cole might act with effect after such parties.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., October 10, 1863-2 p.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN, Jefferson City:

If the rebels retreat and cross the Osage, advise me quickly, and as near as possible where they cross, so that I may order movements from below.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
