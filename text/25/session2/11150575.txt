tendency m some quarters to distrust Republican institutions—
to uphold the anti refoim paity of other nations—to assume
anti democratic ground upon questions of foreign politics—to
be drawn too much, m practical quest ons of domestic politics)
into an ob&cure under current of tmrepubhcan opinions and
feelings—that this it is, beyond and above all other things, which
has given to the Administration Whatever hold it has on the
attachment of the popula? mas.es, and to the samo degieecon
Stitutes the weakness of the Opposition
Our Government is fundamentally Democratic, I use the woid
to. Ira ph losophic, not in its party meaning, resting upon the
sovereignty oí the people We cannot change this If we could,
we ought not It as right And, right or wiong, it is the exist
Sng act to which Government must conform itself justas me
Vitably as agriculture to the natura] qualities of soil and ch
mate You may modify, you may conect evil tendencies,} ou
may improve good ones, but the basis remains unchangeably
the same, and there is no sense in reasoning, nor use in acting,
agamstirreversible facts in the very constitution of things We
lay lose the confidence of the people by thinking or speaking
distrustfully of them, but, in proceeding thus, we establish no
truth, we promote no good end, we simply thiow away our
means of usefulness, and we do not desei ve to possess the con
fidence of the people, unless we legally entertain, and cordial y
act upon, the popular principles which are the very life blood
and spiritual essence of the Constuutu n
Wnetherthis be Fedeialism or Democracy is nnmateual to
me, it is my political (.reed, by whatever name of party it be
called like the gentlemanfiomTennessee, [Mr C H Wil
LiamsJ I desire to be guided by prmcir les, not by names
We may discern, I think, among the opm ons current in the
United States, two extiernes of < onclusion, each of them alike
exceptionable and dangerous tothelioeitmsüf the people One
1j> the disposition indicated by some peisons to draw back, to
shrink from tiusting themseives fiankly to the Democratic spi
ntof our institutions, to maintain a sort of ultra conservatism
whreh ls ¿ policy unptulosophical, because impracticable and
injuuous, because adverse to the organic strncturf of the fede
ral Government The other is the extreme of ultra radicalism,
which, in its eagerness to maintain the right* of the many, disre
gards those ol the few, and w hich, as it can act only by delegated
power, seeks to concentrate us foice in the person oí a populai
chief, the hand to wield the despotic will of the mass, as in ti e
dictatorship of the Roman Republic
Supposing these opposite tendencies to exist m the cummu
mty, what has been then influence upon the action of the Fede
raí Government? Pi actically, how has the Constitution woiked?
Have abuses'crept into the administration of (he Government?
And, if so, what, and how1
In the first place, as to the soui ces of abuse, it is evident
these are various, according to the various elements or parti of
th-- Government
The whole Federal Government might (theoietically speak
mg,) conspire to injure a State, or the people of a ¡state, or sume
of them, by the exercise of some power not granted by the
Constitution, as, if Congress should pass, the Judiciar) sustain,
and the Executive, through the public íunctionanes subordi
nate to him, undertake to cairy into eifect a law to abolish per-
sonal servitude n Virginia or South Carolina
The President asil he should, of his mere motion, without
the authority of an act o Congress, pioclaim war against a io
íeign powei, and, being m command of the military foices of
the nation, proceed to make war
Congress, that is, the Senate and House as if they claim to
enact a law, the veto to the contiary notwithstanding, and with
out avotp of two thirds theieupon
The Senate as if it onginate levenue bills, or appoint am
bassadors without nomination from the Extcutive
The House as if it assume to exercise a concurrent voice m
the ronfiimation of appointments made by the President
The |udiciaiy as if it should take upon itself any of the ex
ecutive functions of the Government
Officers, civil or military, either m the familiar forms of mal
versationm office, or as the instruments of the Executive, m
paiticular acts, or in a system of usurpation
In the second place, as to the modes oí corruption, these also
may be various, according to the objects Either directly in
the people, that isf the person of the cmzen, as if this House
should reiuse to receive petitions setting forth gnevances of
which they complain, oi il the President should undertake to
impress men for the naval service, as piactised in England, oi,
indirectly, by one blanch oi depaument oi the Government
drawing to itself the exercise of poweis belonging o ano her,
and thus violating the order piescribe 1 by the people in their
Constitution
Upon the Constitution ofthe United States, then, in which of
these various ^uaiters, and in what form of action ties the dan
ger1 Fiom which department of the Federal Government is
corruption, encroachment, or usurpation to be most aj>pre
herded
Usurpation by the whole Federal Government, m all its
branches, combined to that cm\ is a question between the Uni
ted States and individual States, or the people, or a portion
of them That I do not now discus  But, as between diffe
rent departments uf the Fedeial Government, I repeat the
question, winch is the most dangerous to the in egrity oí the
Const itution
We may dismiss all serious ftar fiom public functionaries
in. the civil service of the countiy, as fudges, Secretanes of
State, andthe like, because of the natuie of their functions
their want oí pecuniary resources and physical power, then
amenability to the law, and (in legard to all but judges) their
dependence on the Extcutive
So, also, as the men holding command in the naval or military
service ef the country, in addition to which, il usurpation
comes fiom that quarter, we may ust assured it will clothe
itself m the forms of legality For example, the Roman Cesáis,
who overthrow the liberties of the Republic intheform« of law,
by causing themsehesto be continuously invested with legal
functi nsj and thus tendering themselves practically and exclu
sively supreme, whilst all institutions ofthe Republic remain
ed seemingly m full vigoi the woid emperor it is notorious
signifying originally nothing but Commander m Chief Ano
ther example, the dukes and count? of modern Fuiope men
who, id name, as in fact, originally were the holders of a legal
function merely, which, by usurpation, they transformed into d
personal right or fixed rank m the State And, intensely de
voted as the people of the United States are, to Republican
institutions itisb) misuse,probably ofthe form of the Con
«million, if  verataU, that usurpation ot conuptionnvili find its
way into the Federa1 Government
We may, I think, narrow down the consideration, for present
practieal purpose?, to the two prominent departments of the
Government, the I egislative and the Executive, the relative
capacity of which to enero ch on the rights of the other, or of
the people, can be appreciated only by means of a propei ana
ly&is of the Constitution
In the description of the powers of die Federal Government,
and the céfini ien ofthe poweis of the seveial component parts
of it, which the Constitution gives, the Congress stands lorth
eminently from the face of theinstiument It occupies the first
place in the Constitution
And the enumeration of poweis gtanted to Congiess, co
veis, in part oi m whole, the grants of powei parted with
by the respective States to the Federal Government m the ag
g legate.
The^e powers are specific, and therefoie, m themselves,
less liable to abuse by implication, that is, when "legislative
powers" aie spoken of in the Constitution, they aie expressly
declared to be those "herein granted," <,Ait I, sec I,) rcfeirmg,
of course, to thesubsequent enumeration of powerc
And the power  of Congress are legislative powers, that is,
powers m which, foi then effectual exercise, the three subdivi
sions ofthe legislatuie, that is the Piesident, is well an the Se
nate and House of Repiesentatives, concur
The House of Representatives possesses no particular pow
ers, eJccept such as relate, 1st, to its organization and rulet of
proceeding, 2d, the origination of money bills, and, 3d, of lm
peachments, and of these, the first, a power comparatively un
harmful is the only power which is complete as well as parti
cular
T/he Senate possesses no particular poweis, except suchas
lelaeto 1st, its own mgani?ation 2d the trial oí impeach
mentí, 3d, the advisement of the Executive in foreign nego
nations and 4th, the rejection of nomination  and, of these, the
fiist only incomplete
Of checks to usurpation, on the part of the Senate and
House, either conjointly or separately as agam&t the Execu
Uve, there are many Look at the House, foi example its
proceedings are public, by debate, in this hall, before the pre
sence of the whole community—m ihe (ate of the world—seen,
understood, scrutinized at every stage, by an ever vigilant peo
pie, while thedeiiber? ions of theExecurne are confined to his
ownbieast, or to the puvacy of Cabinet councils There
sponsibiht} of thi-s House is more dnect and tangible, being
distubuted into sepaiate constituencies of States and of parts of
States, befcue which n i\ldualmembers are subject lobe held
toarcount, pert-om1 y, for the discharge of their trust, while
the President is withdrawn from contact with the diffeient parts
of the countiy, and placed m the remote dignity of the While
Ilouse We possess no patronage of any < oneequence while
that of the President peí vides the Union W e have ho publ ic
money in our custody, no munitions ol war, no fleets no ioits
t r arsenals, no physical foice by land or sea, neither the smews
noi other msttuments of corruption oi usuipation all which
are m the hands ofthe Executive Our councils aie inter
rupted by adjournment while those c f the Executive have un
broken continuousnpss of pmpose and perpetuity of execution
ours are disurbed by numerousness of peisons his ha\e the
decision and concentration of indiv dual intellect The mem
bersof the Senate and House are not elected for identical pe
nods, and this House foi half the term of the President Fi
nally the action of Congress, m all things, except its own or
gamzatio i and the preferment or trial of impeachments, is sub
ject either to the pievious action ofthe President, or to his veto,
conferied upon him as well to guard his own independence as
to maintain theinteguty of the Constituiion
Fiom this inspection ofthe Constitution I infer that the pow
ers of the two Hou°e-> are not of themselves particularly capa
ble of abuse I am not aware that any facts exist in thr histo
ry of Congress contradictory to the inferences deduced by me
fiom the text of the Constitution And I proceed next to eon
sider how it is, in this respect, with the powers conferred on the
Executive
Foremost among them ts the provision (Art 1 sec 7) which
makes his approbation—except as against a subsequent vote
of two thirds of each House—essential to the enactment of a
law Couple this with a power given to him in another place,
(Art H «eu 3 ) to recommend measuies to CongrebS, and you
see that he is a component branch of the Legtsl iture of the
country, originating and rejecting measures equally with either
House Is not this—I speak now of the veto— a gi eat powei to
be placed m the hands of one man? and a ¡ ower subject to
abuse?
It is the notorious fact that in the couroeof the late Adminls
tration, the veto was exercised more times than m the whole
pievious histoiyof the Government Exeicised not only in he
direct mode ofan express refusal to approve leavir «• to Congress
the t ption to insist oi not by a vote of two third*?, but m the more
objectionable mode of the suppression of bills Giant this, in
the cates leferred to, to have been a constitutional power consti
tutionally exerted, s ill the fact itself* the frequent íepetition of
the veto m the last few jears is indicative at least of a great ad
vanee m the practical power and m the influence of the Ex
ecutive
But this is one of the concurrent powei s ofthe Executive a
function in the discharge of which the President acts in associa
tion with ( ongrcss     Let us look farther into the Constitution
When that instrument comes to «peak of the President pirti
cularly, it says 'The Executive power shall be vested in a
President of the United States ' —(Art II "cc 1 > What is
meant by thiV? Does the word "Executive " in this phrase,
confer any substantive powers on the President?
I hold that when it said,' The Executive power is vested in a
Piesident " the pxpression i=* intended only as a desenpfwn ol
the pers< n who i to exercise the Executive functions, otherwise
described in the Constitution oi to be reposed in the Piesident
fur the execution ofactt. of Congress And I adopt, m this con
necfion, the construction suggested at the last session by the
gentleman from V isnma [Mr Wise 3 In the President aie
vested the 'Execu ive' powets True but what are these
powíT=1 Pait of them aie aftei wards expiessly enumerated,
and the rest are such as Congress may see fit to entrust to the
President either under the several specific powers granted to
Congres , or under the general power which closes the enume
ration, and i  suppletoiv of all the rest—"To make ill laws
which shall le necessary and proper for carrying int" execu
turn the foi coin  powers, and all other powers vested by this
Constitution ut-the Goiernmentofthp Unzttd States or any
Department or officer thereof " —(Art I, sec 8 ) Here is the
life giving clause the grant to Congress ofthe power to infuse
vitality into the undefined poziets of the Executive, which idea
is confirmed by thefáct that, when this word is used by the Con-
s' itution in another place, it is m association with the víord &k
partment, "Executive Depaittnertfp" is the expression, (Ar*
II,sec 2) And these Executive Bepaitments, we all know.
were among the earliest things to be constituted, defined, and
limited, by acts ofthe first Congress which •assembled undertfhe
Constitution And this znpomt of fací t/*s—Trnean byatts of
Congress, that the President has charge ofthe Post Office, the
Treaiuiy De artment, and the Land Office
And yet, for the defence of doubtful acts of authority, the late
adminibtration hadiecourse to the old prerogative doctrine Of
" an origins] Executive power," said to be ** left" in the hajicts
of the Piesident " unchecked by the Constitution **
If the word "Executive" confers substantive powers on the
President—powers deducible from the intrinsic meaning Of thb
woid—how is that meaning to be measured! How denned
and limited'' Is it a Bi itish Executive, or a French Executive,
or a Russian Executive, or, peradventure, a Turkish Ex
ecutive?
If the President possesses any substantive powers in Virtue rif
this word, it is a power vast, immense, incalculable, immeá
surable there will be no limitation to the acts of authority
which may shelter themselves under lis ample iolds But I
utterly deny this monstrous doctrine, and I mark it, and the act
peiloimed under it, as innovations in favor of the Executive
and encioachments, deep and dangerous, on the powers of Con
gress
Foi, while the Administration waspiofu«ein the profession of
a desiie to confine the Federal Government within ilsapproprl
ate functions, ltis to be remarked that^ in the actual practice of
that Admin stration, new limitations were applied only to those
oi the powers oí the Go\ ei nment in which Congress must parti
cipate, I hat is to say, the enactment of laws the scope of things
to be done bv the Houses of Congress was lessened while that
of thii gs to be done by the Executive, independently of Con*
gie*s, was extended
But to proceed We come now to the Executive powers e.r-
pi essly granted to the Executive in and by the Constitution,
and ol ihese f mean to select the moie important only, m illus
tration of the views I entertain
' The President shall be Commander in chief of the army and
navy of the United totate&, and of the militia ofthe sevei al States,
when called into the actual service of the United States "—(Art
H sec 2 ) A power how vast' Conferring immense patron
aere, and controlling the entire physical force of the countiy'
A power, this alone erearei, in its piacticalexercise and unme
diaie efferth than all the powers whatsnevei, whicn are confer
led on Congress Giving to the President himself, nay, to a
smsrleoihcerof the army or navy acting on a hint from him,
the disnetion of peace or war in a thoueanu cutical contngen
cíes For example, it has repeatedly, three signal times atleast,
in the history of the Fedeial Government, happened, that the
Executive oran officer under him, has mcaded the territory of
a Inendly powei m time of peace Is not this a power some
what capable of abuse1
lie may íequire the opinion in writing, of the principal of*
ficei in each of the Executive Departments "—(Art II, sec 2 )
It dees not =ay control the action of those principal officers, but
íequire their opinion, which supposes, of necessity, thatthey
hate opinions of their own Moieover, if the President may
absolute!} pres nbetho conduct of these officers ifthereisany
thing in the Constitution which confers on him such power,
why be at the pains of giving to him the much less powei, to íe
quire their opinions'1 The infinite gieater power would of
course comprehend thejitnitp less one Couple this clause of
' Executive Depaitments" wuh that of "Executive power,"
an! apply to hoth the c lause that Congress may make laws for
carr> mg into execution all powers vested in any depai tment
oi ojicei of the Federal Government and the conclusa n Is
manifest, as I have sta ed before, that the -vitality of the func
tionsof the Executive is, under the Constitution, to be infused
into them by the legislation of Congress
Yet, we have, m late times, seen "the pi mcipal officers of the
Executive Departments" treated as the mere servants ofthe
President, the humble instruments of his supreme will, instead
of w iat the ( onstitution suppose** lh" agents of the law
of the land and the instruments of Congress as well as of
the President, which 1 mark as another dangerous innova-
tion
"fe shall have powei to make treaties " Here is an immense
power, a power of peace or war, a powei larger than any
which is exercised by law, for though it be provided that the
treaty shall be made "by and with the consent of the Senate,"
vet, according to the established construction of the Constitu
tion the negoh tions aie actually conducted throughout by
the President
Look at the compass of this treaty power For example,
the Piesident may, of his own simple discretion, unsubjected
to the coi tiol or advice of any other department of the Go
vemment so word a despatch, or other public document, as of
necessity m time of war to effect peace or in time of peace to
produce war, frequent cases of which could be given from the
hiMoiy of our relations with Great Butam and with France
For anoihei example the President may, of his own mere
rpotio*1 double the teintory of the United States by a treaty of
acquisition, and though the ucaty must of course be submitted
to one, oi it may be both, of the Houses of Congress, yet the
question will then he, not whether Congress will make theac
quisinon of a territory, but whethei it will reject a territory al
leody acquired     Thio was the case of Louisiana
It may be—I do not know but that, in the predestined march
of ewpire the United States will cover this continent But if
itistob1so it will hapen, Ido believe not from any previous
resolution of the people of the United States or of Congress,
to enter upen a grand career of conquest or aggrandizement,
butiatheun tuture times as m past, through the exercise, on
the part of the Piesident of the practical discretion over the
question of wai and of territorial acquisition, which the treaty
power confers on the Executive
' He shall nominate and by and with the advice and consen'
of the Senate shall appoint ambassadors other ministers and
consuls judges of the Súpleme Court, and ai! other officers of
the United Mates, <&c Here is the patronage power of the
Executive— a pown which even though regularly exercised,
and without removals for opinion is yet a tremendous engine
of influence
Heie is the patro age power of ihe Executive—a power,
which even though iegularly exerci°ed and without removals
for opinion is yef a tremendous engine of mflufnee and autho
i itv, because it renders the Pre idem the gieat fountain of honor
and profit
