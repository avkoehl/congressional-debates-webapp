Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

No positive changes or movements of the enemy have been observed in our immediate front. It was reported that the picket force on the left had been reduced, and on the right that some 50 or 100 yards of the chevaux-de-frise had been removed opposite to the interval between Stedman and Numbers 9; also, that the smoke of camp-fires had largely increased. A deserter, sergeant of a South Carolina regiment, came in during the night; reports no change on our front. The Engineer Brigade moved over to the Aiken house yesterday.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-11.15 a. m.

Please examine into the matter of the chevaux-de-frise and report positively whether or not any of it has been removed.

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-11.30 a. m.

Major-General PARKE:

Warren drove the enemy handsomely for some time on both the Vaughan road and the Dabney's Mill road, but at 6 p. m. the force in front of Gregg, on the Vaughan road, left him and concentrated on the left of Crawford, on the Dabney's Mill road, driving back the whole line to the original position. For a time there was much confusion. If the weather be not too bad Warren will renew the attack to-day.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to General Getty.)
