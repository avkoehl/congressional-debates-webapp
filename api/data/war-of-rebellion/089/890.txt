to the point threatened, as Miles is nearer the enemy's lines than he is to ours. His right flank is, besides, open to a movement down the Duncan road. I have rather anticipated as the result of Our last movement that Hatcher's Run would be found next time more strongly guarded.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 9, 1864. (Received 12.15 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

General Canby has relieved General Steele from the command of the Department of Arkansas for failing to supply Fort Smith and his western posts in season. As it might not be please for Steele to serve under a division commander who relieved him from the command of a department, I have expressed a willingness that Parke should be ordered to report to Canby and Steele placed in command of the Ninth Corps. Steele is one of the best of commanders of troops in hand.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 9, 1864-1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch in regard to proposed change in command of the Ninth Corps is received, and I have to state the same is satisfactory to me.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 9, 1864-1.45 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

It is highly desirable that we should learn what the enemy are doing, but General Miles will have to be left with discretionary powers as to the method of forcing the crossing of Hatcher's Run. I would simply say to him that the object is to learn if the enemy have detached against Warren, and with what force, and leave him to select the way to do it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 9, 1864-2 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I forward you a dispatch from Major-General Humphreys and my reply thereto, which will explain existing condition of affairs and answer yours of 1.45 p. m.:

General S. WILLIAMS, Assistant-General:

"HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,

"December 9, 1864-12 m.

"I succeeded in forcing a crossing and have about 100 men over. The river is filled with fallen trees and about four feet deep. I am trying to cross the cavalry single file and construct bridges at the ford half a mile above. The enemy are moving about two regiments to the right.

"N. A. MILES,

"Brevet Major-General."

Respectfully forwarded.

A. A. HUMPHREYS.
