Issue vf Treasury Notes.—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
These are the distinctive feamres of the two
classes of notes Now try the committee's bill by
the test of these qualities. It will be found that
the notes which it authorizes belong to the first
named class, that they are to beai an interest,
which may be six percent , that they aie tramferra-
Me only by endorsement—that thcv are not ie-issua-
ble—that they are to be paid ata day cei tain, to wit,
withm one jear—that they are not to be issued of
less denomination than one hundred dollars—are
to be cancelled when taken up—and that the Secie-
tary of the Treasuiv is expressly authorised to
rais" money upon them by loaning them
These are the features and qualities of the notes
to be issued, and the> define and fix then charac-
ter as notes to raise loans, ?nd to b  laid by as in-
vestments, and cot as note* for currency, to be
pushed into cnculation by the powei of the Go-
vernment, and to add to the curse of the day by in-
creasing the quantity of unconvertible paper
money
The execution of the act, and especially the car-
dinal feature of the quantum of interest, is left to
the President and the Secretary of the Tie?sury I
presume it will be executed as a law to borrow
monev, and in that point of iww the interest was
left open, under a maximum limit, as is proper to
be done m all propositions it r loans Lids maybe
mvited by ach ertise nent the competition of len-
deis may fiv the interest, capitalists may fix it bv
competition, though nominally left to the discretion
of ihe President and ^ecietarj , and at whatever rate
His thus fixed—at vvhatevei ratea loan of gold
and silvei is commanded—at that ía'e the «hole
issue, made at an} one tnnt, ought to go There
should not hi two rates of interest, a high one for
the independent and o\ nlent capitalist, and a lovs
one for the helpless and necessitous public cieditor
This is nry opinion of the charactei of these
Treas'Hj nc c , and o<* t! e mo 'e 01 ucing tliem I

and the facility with wh'ch 1 -rgp "mounts of specie
were borrowed immediately af'er t\e bank sitspen-
suns, and the commercial revulsions of 1819 The

Mr. Chaves—so vc can all ipnT>mbei—but to re-
fresh memono, and esiab1 sh thr importani fact, I
will read a paragiaph f m IIi Cbev^s's late let'er
to Dr  Cooper
"Before tie c'osp of the first \eai of roj ad-
min strati on, adequate capital hau been a*s neJ to
th° office in which it h">d been defic en', aid the
bann andisofnces genera!!}, then c- M-iv soon
after, wprc in a cordmon to do extensive b ismes-,
had the situ?tin ot the eounnv pe raitted it But
the commerce of the county i~pc?me perfectly
stagnant Money was a drug. The bank, to keep
•up its hi. 'mess as far as possible, discounted long
paper, say at four and >\ months, pud pe-haps
longer It was even pn pos d, with the same ob-
ject, to lower the rate of interest to five per c=nt
I believe local banks at Boston did, in some in
stances, discount at that rate In Philadelphia, I
think, the local banksdiscounted paper having nine
months to run, and perhaps rnoie The commerce
of the country was reduced from a state of gieat
excitement, such as vve have just witnessed, to a
state of collapse, such as I fear we maj soon suf-
fer Under these circumstances the discounts fell
off, the bank uas too soft It had, at times, I be-
lieve, as much specie, perhaps moie, m its vaults
than it had notes in circulation Undei this want
of demand tor monrv, I \ as so fortunate as to ob-
tain the public lopns, ti the amount of six millions
of dollars, which the lank was able to pav foi,
and retain an abiWance of specie in its vaults "
Stch is (he testimony of Sir Cheves, and thus

the (listless now is not tie tvthe of what it uas
then, the leal monej n the country, the go'd and

now, the disttess then uas all ieal,and no jia?í of it
assumed, pretended, aitiíicial, torced, and fictitious,
contrived with malice afoiethou^ht, to govern elec-
tions and politics, and to coerce the revivification
of a national bank
I remember the times of which Mi. Cheyes
speaks 1 came to t k Senate m 1820, and I know
that his picture of the abundance of monev, the
facility of gett ng loans an 1 the low rate of inte-
rest, is entir ly just Om ow n legislation pioves

The bill has !>vn denounced as thu g ma of a
new natío ia' qtbt I1 cc-taif v pronoses the
crea'ia" of a debt Tut for w i<-> purpose, and
under what c <i st luces'* To cinplj vyith the
mrxnn, that a. public debt is a pjbho  blessing1
By no means' But to relieve "the States from
being called upon for aieimbursement of aav pait
of the twenty-seven millions of dolíais1 which have
been deposited with them—to relieve the mer-
chants from an immediate payment of four mil-
lions—and to rehev e the late deposite banks from
an immediate press for six millions. This is the
object. The loan of ten millions on the Treasury
notes comes hi place of the four and six millions
due from merchants and the banks It is because
we cannot collect one, that we create the other. If
we had the ten millions from the merchants and
the banks, we should not want the Treasury notes;
not beinjable to collect those ten millions, we give
time to our debtors, and borrow an equivalent sum.
The outstanding debt due to the United States is
equal to the debt created, it will be a fundtop'v
it, mtpiestaad ad, foi the merchants and banks are
to pay interest, and then the Treasury note debt be-
comes a mere nominal liansaction, so far as debt
is concerned, being no burden to the United States,
and a íelief to her debtors.
This is the cbject of this nominal debt, and un-
der what crcimstantes is it created"2 Under the
same \vhi'h cceasioned eight millions to be bor-
rowed b> direct 1 \> \ 11 the two succeeding sessions
after fie catas laphe of 1819 We have run the
career of that period over again, and the parallel
is exact in eveiv puticu'ar Then, as now, we
had had our dream of inexhaustible surpluses,
and w ere waked up to the reality of an empty
ueasurv. Then, as now, vvc had our fort5'-seven
millions of levtnue, cur nine millions of annual
surplus—our bank expansions—our mad specula-
tions—our bloated and delusive prosperity, and
then, as now, we were called together to borrow
eight millions for the suppoit of the Government,
to hear the cries ot distiess, ond the calls for tehof
The eight millions borrowed then, and borrowed
w tli the appiov mg voice of some who now stigma-
tise a similai loan, under similar circumstances,
and for the same object, was not considered as the
germ of a new national debt, neither will our loan
be so considced by the country.
I trust I have vindicated the bill from the stig-
ma of being a paper currency bill, and from the
imputa'ion of being the first step towards the crea-
tion oí a new national debt. I hope it is fully
cleaned from the odium oí both these imputations.
I will now say a ievv words on the policy of is-
suing Treasury notes in time of peace, or even m
time of war, until the ordinary resources of loans
• and taxes had been ttied aid exhausted. I am
no fi lend to the issu  of Treasury notes of any
kind As loans, tle^ ri_ a.disgmseJ mode of bor-
íowing, and easy to slide into a curiency as a
cmiencj, it is the most seductive, the most dan-
gerous, mil the most liable to abuse of all the de-
s notions of pap r mono . " Tht stamping of pa-
ya (by Government) is an opeiahon so much, timer
than, Ihe laying aj taxes, 01 of borrowing money, thai
a Govei nm^nl t  the habit of papel emissions would
laidy fall, in any emergency, to indulge xlself too
fir in, the employment of that tesonrce to «void
as much as possible, one lew auytcicus to pre
sent popnlanty" So sail General II ,11'on;
and JerTersm, Madison, Macon, Randolph, and
all the fathers of the repub tcan church, concurred
with h m These sagacious statesmen w eie <*hr of
this facile and seductive resouice, "so liable to
abuse, and so certain of being abused " They held
it inadmissible to tecui to it m time of peace, and
tlw it co nd only be thought of amidst the exigen-
cies and perils of war, and that aPer exhausting
the direct and responsible alternatives of loans and
taxes Bred in the school of these great men, I
came heie at this se-sion to oppose, at all risks, an
1 >ue of Treasury notes I pieferred a direct loan,
nd that for ma.11 y and cogent reasons. There is
clear autnonty to borrow in the Constitution, but,
to fmd authority to issue these notes, we must enter
the held of constructive powers To borrow is to
do a responsible act, it is to incur ceitam accounta-
bihty to tne coistituent, and heavj censure it it
cannot be justified, to íss'ie these notes is to do an
act which few consider of, which takes but little
bold of th- public mind wh.eh few condemn and
some encourage, because it increases the quantum
of what is y atnly called money   Loans are limited
