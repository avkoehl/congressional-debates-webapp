Mr. VAN WINKLE. I should like to have
the attention of the chairman of the Naval
Committee. Yesterday the Naval Committee
reported back a petition of naval officers of
League Island, praying for relief to Mrs. Jane
Dean Bishop, and moved that it be referred to
the Committee on Pensions. On examining the
petition I see that there is no claim for a pen-
sion. On the contrary it is simply that the
back pay to which this surgeon may be entitled
may be transferred and placed to the credit of
his widow, owing to certain circumstances; it
is to date it back to a certain day and pay the
increase up to that time. I move that it be
referred back to the NavalCommittee. Itseems
to me to be a good case if the proof main-
tains it.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN, from the Committee on
Finance, to whom was referred the memorial
of the Legislature of the Territory of Mon-
tana in lavor of the establishment of a branch
mint in that Territory, asked to be discharged
from its farther consideration; which was
agreed to.
He also, from the same committee, reported
a bill (S. No. 968) authorizing certain banks
named therein to change their name; which
was read, and passed to a second reading.
Mr. MORGAN, from the Committee on
Commerce, to whom was referred the bill (H.
R. No. 375) to repeal an act approved March
2, 1867, entitled " An act to regulate the dis-
position of fines, penalties, and forfeitures
received under the laws relating to the cus-
toms, and for other purposes," and to amend
certain acts for the prevention and punishment
of frauds on the revenue, and for the preven-
tion of smuggling, reported it with an amend-
ment, and submitted a report; which was
ordered to be printed.
Mr. POMEROY, from the Committee on
Public Lands, to whom was referred the bill
(S. No. 8G6) granting a right of way over the
public lands of the United States to the Oro-
villo and Virginia City railroad, and to provide
for its construction, reported it with amend-
ments.
BILLS INTRODUCED
Mr. RAMSEY asked, and by unanimous
consent, obtained leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 967) authorizing the allowance of the claim
of the State of Minnesota to lands for the sup-
port of a State University ; which was read
twice, by its title, referred to the Committee on
Public Lands, and ordered to be printed.
PRIVATE LAND CLAIMS IN NEW MEXICO.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I ask the Senate to take
tip a little bill from the Committee on Private
Land Claims this morning. I think it will
induce no controversy. It is House bill No.
1345.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. I desire to make
some reports.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Allow me to take up this
bill and then I will give way to reports.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent. Does any Senator object ?
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee ot the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (H. R. No. 1345) to amend an
act entitled "An act to confirm certain private
land claims in the Territory of New Mexico."
Mr. WILLIAMS. I have made a written
report in reference to this bill. If any Sen-
ator desires to hear it, it can be read. It
simply regulates the surveys of the public lands
there.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
ABBOTT Q. BOSS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask the consideration
of the Senate for a bill for the relief of Abbott
Q. Ross. I believe this is the only private bill
1 have called up this session. It is for the
relief of one of my constituents.
By unanimous consent, the bill (S. No. 845)
for the relief of Abbott Q. Ross was read the
second time, and considered as in Committee
of the Whole. It requires the Secretary of the
Treasury to pay to Abbott Q. Ross, ot'Cleves,
Ohio, the sum of $5,000 as compensation for
the past and future use in the United States
Navy of his invention for using hot water and
steam as a weapon in naval warfare for extin-
guishing fires, and for other purposes.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I should like
to hear some explanation of this bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. There is a report from
the Naval Committee on the subject. It is a
very small sum, given to this gpntleman for
an invention of universal use, which will prob-
ably save hundreds of thousands of dollars to
the Government of the United States. The
report of the Naval Committee is with the
papers in full. It is recommended, I believe,
by Admiral Porter and others. It is a very
strong case, although I think the amount is
too small.
Mr. DRAKE. While waiting for the re-
port, I suggest to the Senator from Ohio to
put in before the word "compensation" the
word " full."
Mr. SHERMAN. Certainly; I have no
objection to that.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That
amendment will be made.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, was read the third time, and
passed.
ORDISB OF BUSINESS.
Mr. CORBETT. I ask that the Senate will
allow me to take up Senate bill No. 735.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I will inquire what the
bill is.
Mr. CORBETT. It is for the purpose of
preventing the extermination of fur bearing
animals in Alaska and to protect the inhabit-
ants thereof, and it was reported with amend-
ments.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I hope the Senate will
not take up that bill in the morning hour, but
let us finish the judicial system bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent. Does any Senator ob-
ject?
Mr. CORBETT. I wish to state that this is
to put into the Treasury of the United States
something over one hundred thousand dollars.
I have been trying to get it up for the past two
or three weeks ; but it is very difficultto get up
a bill to put money into the Treasury, though
very easy to get up bills to take it out.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Is it a House bill ?
Mr. CORBETT. It is a Senate bill.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Then it is not likely
that at this session it can become a law.
Mr. TRUMBULL. There was abill up yes-
terday morning to reorganize the judicial sys-
tem, and 1 hope that at some time I shall be
allowed to finish it.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Does the Senator from
Oregon withdraw his motion?
Mr. CORBETT. I do not wish to withdraw
it. 1 have been urged by the Senator from
Connecticut and others.
Mr. FESSENDEN. It is no use.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does any
Senator object?
Mr. FE8SENDEN. If the Senator from
Oregon withdraws his motion 1 should like to
call up House bill No. 1906, averysmall matter.
Mr. CORBETT. This is a bill for the pro-
tection of these animals and allowing the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to lease certain islands.
It has got to be done very soon in order that
the people may go there to enter upon this
work.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Senator could not
expect to pass a Senate bill through the other
House at this stage of the session.
Mr. GRIMES. Does this bill authorize
leases?
Mr. CORBETT. It authorizes the Secretary
of the Treasury to lease the islands on the best
terms, and for every seal that is taken parties
