Numbers 97. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Near Centreville, September 1, 1862.

To the Officer commanding the forces around Fairfax Court-House:

General Pope directs that you furnish one regiment of infantry as an escort for a wagon train from Fairfax Court-House to Fairfax Station. Lieutenant Devin, Ninth Infantry, will call for the escort as he proceeds through the town.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Numbers 98. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Centreville, September 1, 1862-11 a. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

The enemy is deploying his forces on the Little River pike, and preparing to advance by that road on Fairfax Court-House. This movement turns Centreville and interposes between us and Washington, and will force me to attack his advance, which I shall do as soon as his movement is sufficiently developed. I have nothing like the force you undoubtedly suppose, and the fight will be necessarily desperate. I hope you will make all preparations to make a vigorous defense of the entrenchments around Washington.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Numbers 99. CENTREVILLE, September 1, 1862-12 m.

Major-General McDOWELL:

You will march rapidly back to Fairfax Court-House with your whole division, assuming command of the two brigades now there, ad immediately occupy Germantown with your whole force, so as to cover the turnpike from this place to Alexandria. Jackson is reported advancing on Fairfax with 20,000 men. Move quickly.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

By command of Major-General Pope:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
