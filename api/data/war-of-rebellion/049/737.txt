HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, September 20, 1863.

Colonel JOHN McCAUSLAND,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: I telegraphed you last night that the situation of affairs in East Tennessee and near Saltville renders it absolutely necessary to order to the latter place the Sixtieth Virginia Regiment. The enemy are between Generals Jones and Wharton, and the utmost promptness can alone save us. This exposes you, but I hope you can maintain yourself with the Eighth Virginia Cavalry until another regiment of General Jenkins' brigade, now on its way to you, gets up. Of course, you must fall back, if necessary, and try to hold the Narrows and Rocky Gap. A company from the First Brigade has been ordered to the Narrows as a guard.

If Scammon learns the state of things at Zollicoffer and Bristol, an advance will doubtless be made. Be prepared, therefore, for any move, and keep a sharp lookout in your front and in the direction the raiders last came. Nothing but the most urgent necessity would have caused this move.

Very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
