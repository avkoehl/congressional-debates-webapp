GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL
Mr    TILLMORE inquired  of the  Speaker  whether  a'l
the public business  on  the  Speaker's   table had  been dis-
posed of!
The SPEAKER replied mtheafhimative
Mr FILLMORE moved that the House reso vo itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
After some conversation between Mi TILLMORE and
Mr. GEN fRY, the former gentleman waived his mo ion, to
enable
Mr GENTRY to submit a motion made by him on a foimer
day, but withdiawn
Mr G said te did not know sufficient of the parliamentary
law to be aware whether 01 not he I ad a right to piefacelns
motion with a few remarks explanatory of us object
The SPEAKER said it could only be done by ger.eial con
sent
Mr GENTRY then moved that the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, to whom Hoi =e b''l N > 74 (being the
"¿ill making appropuauons for ihe civil and diplomauc ex
penses of the Government for the year 1&42") had been re<ei led,
be instructed to sti ike out every item oí appropriation which
was not authorized by existms laws
Mr G was proceeding to make some remaiks, when
Mr BOWNE objected
But, aftei abuet conversation between Messrs GElNTRli,
BOWNE, FILLMORE, and the SPEAKER—
Mr BOWNE, at the suggestion of Mr friiiMORE, withdrew
his objection
Mr GEN TRY said that he had observ ed, when the House
was m Committee of the Whole on Thursday last, and had the
Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation bil)-" under coisideralion,
that the Committee of Ways and Means ¡fed, in then expose ac-
companying that bill, laiddowpa pruKipIc of reform which
was calculated to  lead to the most ¡Salutary consequences
He was serious  in  that deejaiatiog     Yet  he   had   been
sorry to perceive that, aftei  laying flown a sound and silu
tary general principle of legiá an r£ they themselves s en ed
in some degree to  shrink  fiom its app'icanon    The prm
«pie was this that no i'em should  1 e included in any ap
propnation bill which had not the express sanction  ol law
This was a principle which thtf House hal recognised  anl
sancuoned, by inserting it as one of the rules of order which
should govern ils   pioeeedinss    And  accorhng   tj the deci
sion of the gentleman who íad then occupied fie chan of the
Committee of tie Whol , [Mr  Casey]   the  ule was one
which must be observed     Vet the Committee ol Ways and
Means, in reporting tt is bill, had not governed   the n«o ves
bythatxule    They had, indeed expiessed theii as ent to it,
just so far as was necessary to bung it to the not ce of the
House, and yet trey had mseited  i i  then   hill items  no
sanctioned by  any law   thus acting m Ihe  very face of the
principle they had themselves laid dtwn    The rn.ee ion of
order having been rai ed  by a gentleman Horn  Ma   trim
setts, [Mr   Cushino ]     he   chauuiin   of the Oommi tee of
the Whole had decided that  an ameno nont of ti e bill   to in
elude items which were not sanctioned bylaw was not in oidc-i
Still, the chairman   of the Finance Committee  had  hure lf
stated to the House that the committee hai1 already inserted items
of that description in the bill to the amou it of $S2 216   Ye ,
an amount of appropriation amou iting to upwards ol ei«lny
thousand dolíais was avowedly a«ked for objects not legalized
by anyactof Congress  foi objects wbicha rule of the House
prohibited to be introduced into such a bill    Now, what Mr G
had proposed in the insti unions he had moved was,  that the
Committee of Ways and Means be requn ed to act out their own
principle, and, in conformity with it, to suiko ci eveiy item of
appropriation not covered by law    He coiiHtlei d the n,ot on
asoneof vast importance, because of the pimcip'e it embo
died    Some approved the obj-ct Mr G bad in view butdffer
ed from him as to the mode of leaching it     fhey wi hed ash 
Wished,   that this  tppropnatiun  billshiuhl   appr ipiute the
public money foi nothing that ha 1 not the exi re.-  sanction of
law    But they «aid there was no need o'ihj  ng instruc ions
of this kind in the House because eveiy item not warnntcd by
law could.successivcly, bestrrckenoutin committee,and-o long
as they were kept out of the bill, wnat difference did it make
how that was done"! ButMr G must bo pel mi ted to say tb it m
his view it n ade a very great diffeience In the one case mem beis
acted uudei the liability tnlme their votes lecorded by yeas
and nays, and thus made known to their constituents   m the
other they did not    No yeas and nays could be callei in com
mittee, and the Journal would not show whether a n embei was
even present when the bill was discussed    But this wa« not all
By adopting these instructions the II >u=e solemnly and del be
rately asserted the print 11 le, but by simply stnkmsout ifis
mCommittee of the Whole, no principle was expie-sed     The
expression of opinion would be emphatie il the House aftei a

Yes, this "undefined field of contingencies," of which the pa
ti lot spoke with so much truth and force, was an area on which
men m high place had "played tricks before high Heaven that
made the angels weep " Fi lends and relatives had here been
pensioned oat, and political partisans rewarded, without sha
dow oflaw effices had been created, and emoluments attached
to tnem, a 1 the mere will and pleasure of men, themselves ir
responsible foi thus acting, in the very face of their acknow
ledged duty as guardians of the people's riguts An appropria
tion bill had obtained the faeeuous and nut 11 appropriate name
of an omnibus into which every sottof expenditure was ciowd
ed w leh c  uld find no oilier place of refuge The bill was
passed in Ctmnnttee of the Whole, often when not two thirds
of the House were in their seats, and ihen, in the House the
previousqiestion cut off discussion Thus the responsibility
of members fot theexpendituieof the public mofey, if not de
stroyed, was at least greatly weakened A return to ppet fc
appropriations was the only effectual mode ol introducing a
valuab'e íelorm in this, important blanch ol legisi itmn
In advocitmg a measure like this, Mr G was not tobeun
derstood as passsing censure against the particular items m
eluded by the committee in the bill, and which this instruction
would rescind Many ol them might be very necessaiy and
pioper, and such as he should be willing to vote for m a pro
