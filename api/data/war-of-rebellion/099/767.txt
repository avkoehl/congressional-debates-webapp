I think the rest is coming. They will probably try it again to-morrow. Couch is heard from, and is to be at Beaver Dam Creek to-night. I hope he will get up in time. We shall try to hold here until he comes, even though the enemy may get in our rear. Bring up all the troops from Morehead to New Berne, and prepare to hold that place in any event. Use the trains to bring up supplies here and troops to New Berne. All other work may be stopped for a day or two.
