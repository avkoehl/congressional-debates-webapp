Jane, 1838.                         APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._________________- 403
25th Cong '••S.sn Sess.                                     Independent Treasury—Mr. Dromgoole.                                                                H. of Reps.
powers of the Federal Government, as resulting
from the compact to  which the States are parties,
as limited by the plain sense and intention of the
instrument constituting that compact, as no farther
valid than they are authorized by the grants enu-
merated m that compact, and that in case of a de-
liberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other
powers not granted by the compac*, the States, who
are parties thereto, have the right, a d are in duty
bound, to interpose for airnstmg the progress of the
evil, and for maintaining, within their respective
limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties, apper-
taining to them "   Holding fast to  this doctrine,
maintaining that the States, as sovereign  partes,
having no common arbiter, may interpret the com-
pact for themselves, and may interpose to arrest its
violation, as a State rights man, I cannot   hnit—
on the contraiy, I utterly deny—that Congress, or
any department of the Federal Government, the
mere creature or agent of the parties, can construe
the powers, or define the limits of State authority
Congress is not a competent tribunal, and cannot
undertake to decide whether any provision of the
Federal Constitution prohibits the States from cre-
ating banking institutions    I am not to be under-
stood as contending that such a question might not
incidentally arise before the courts of the United
States, or that they could not properly decide such
point, arising in a case of which, under the Consti-
tution, they had cognizance    Nor do I mean to
deny that their decision, pronounced m such a
case, would be of binding obligation between the
parties litigant    I decline therefore, a discussion
of the constitutionality of State banks, and shall ad-
mit, for the purpose of argument, their rightful ex-
istence.   On this occasion too, I decline an exa-
mination of their expediency or utility    For the
present, also,  the important   inquiry is waived,
whether their exclusive privileges and chartered im-
munities are in accordance with thegemus andpnn-
oples of Republican government, or consistent with
the equal righto of all the citizens.    I will not in-
dulge myself here to speak of the great question of
bank reform—the  great question of a necessary
and thorough  revisal of the entire system and
doctrine   of  corporations—questions   which   are
irresistibly forcing themselves upon public  con-
sideration both m England and America, m spite
of all Conservative  resistance in bc'h countrns
Waiving the discussion of these topics on this floor,
I proceed to an examination, not of the provisions
in detail, but of the principles ot this fondly che-
rished scheme of selecting m the first instance, and
then employing, by contract,  St- te banks to per-
form the fiscal operatiors of the Fedeial Govern-
ment    I arraign it before the  country, and im-
peach it at the bar of pablic opinion oí \lolating
some of the express provisions of the Const tution
■—of tending to defeat the object designed, by the
substitution of a direct power to raise íevenue, in
place of the indirect mode of requisitions on the
States—of exercising " other powers not granted m
the compact"—of disfiguring, if not obliterating, I
the line of distinction and separation between   le i
authorities of the United States and of the respec- '
tive States—of contradicting the settled doctrines ,
of political economy, and grossly mistaking the  |
nature and effect oí taxation and public expendí- i
ture—and finally, upon a comprehensive view of
all its purposes, promises, and designs, I accuse it
of commending to our lips a rank and poisonous |
Federalism, worthy of the time and the school of i
Alexander Hamilton.                                               '
The plan of converting the State banks, by i
league and compact, into aa adequate and uniform i
fiscal system for the whole United States, require 
a latitudmous construction of the Constitution,
and an expanded exertion oí Federal power, extra-
vagant, unprecedented, and alarming. Solemnly
and deliberately convinced that such is the charac-
ter of the measure, I am impelled by a sense of
duty to essay its exposure to public reprehension,
and although I strongly desire to indulge a peace-
ful temper and a conciliatory spirit, to avoid cri-
mination, dissension, and division , and to prefer
no charge against personal friends and political
associates, yet, sir, this sense of duty to my con-
stituents and my country is paramount and must.
be obeyed.
By reference, Mr Chairman, it will be clearly
perceived that the clauses of the Constitution which
have been cited absolutely require  that the reve-
nue, and all the "public money," shall be kept m
a Treasury     It is, therefore, the duty of Congress
to create by law,  to call into existence by legal
enactment, this Treasury, in which the public mo-
ney must be deposited when collected or received,
and it is also the duty of Congress so to regulate
and guard the custody of the revenue, that it may
be ready at every moment, without contingency or
delay, after its receipt into the Treasury, when le-
quired, to meet appropriations     As the revenue
must be placed m the Treasury, and as no money
can be drawn therefrom but in consequence of
appropriations made by law, it results conclusively
that no part of the public money once received into
the Treasury can be intermediately withdrawn, or
otherwise used and employed    Now, sir, a Trea-
sury cannot be recognised by these essential cha-
racteristics—of hew the receptacle of all public
money, retain n? it    care p ia nviolate for any
purpose but ft r ap ropr «tioiis, and keeping it evei
read} for 'hest—an'e^s it >e oí the entire creation,
and under the separate and independent supervi-
sion and regulation, of the constituted authorities of
the United States    This Treasury, to answer the
wise purposes of its institution, must, of course, be
entrusted to the management of human agency, and
this agency, to insure its fideh'y and efficiency,
must be neld strictly accountable and responsible,
and made susceptive of coercion into a proper dis-
charge of duty    The laws creating and organizing
the Trepsmy may and ought to contain sanctions,
they may and ought to prescribe and enforce fine
and pun shment tor delinquency and failure     Cor-
poiations, especially those existing by State ?utho-
rity, cannot completely   and effectually, if at all,
be subjected to compulsatory and penal legislation
Hence not only the superior expediency, but, to
my mind, tne necessity, of selecting xndividual ra-
ther than corroíate agency—of employing natural
ra her than artificial persons     If this be so, it can-
not  be completely and effectually accomplished
unless the Treasury is   wholly administered by
officers of the Federal Government.    Yes, sir, th«
officers proper of the Treasury must be appointed
and commissioned, as officers of the United States,
by authority of the Federal Government, must be
amenable to the same authority, punishable by the
same authority, and by the same authority remova-
ble from ofcp
According to my perception, it appears clear
and indisputable that the opposite of the public
money in the State banks and the grant of its
entire custody to them and their officers, a-e a
violation of the positive provisions of the Constitu-
tion, which requ re that this public money shall be
placed in the Treasury, and there so kept, that no
part shall be withdrawn at any time, or for any
purpose, 'but in consequence of appropriations
made by law " But the revenue, the public mo-
ney, thus on deposite, although collected and re-
ceived, is not actually in the Treasury of the United
States It is tnere only by contemplation of the
law—it is there only by the magic of legal con-
struction The revenue is placed m the possession
of these corporations, they have the same use and
control of the public money, for all purposes of
business, as they have of the money and funds of
themselves, and, in palpable contradiction of this
fiagrart fact, a credulous and confiding consti-
tuprxy are gravely invited to believe, to take it for
grrnted, that the money is really and bona fid' m
me Treasury, lying ready and capable of being
drawn therefrom according to law
Sir, this requires a force of the imagination, a
transport of the fancy, utterly beyond the exertions,
of plain sense and common observation It is of-
fering an idle mockery to an honest man's reason.
It cannot be that the mass of the people of this
country have a love for fiction and romance so ex-
tensively cultivated, so exquisitely refined, as to re-
quite artifice and deception foi its gratification, m
the dull and diy corcein o{ an account current of
receipts and expenditures It cannot be that the
people are yet prepared to adopt a system, and
stamp it with " a final consideration and deliberate
adherence," which authoriMs ard requires finaaciil
inventions, instead  of " a reguiar statement and
account of the receipts and expenditures oí all pub-
lic money " An honest and confiding peop'e cheer-
fully and generously discharge all theu public bur-
dens, they ungrudgingly,  and without complaint,
satisfy the last exactions of their Got ern merit, with
an uncorrupted simplicity, they rca' ly oehe-ve thai
their contributions, rendered m willing obe 1 ence oj
law, will be put in  their own commjn Treasury,
and drawn ont only to meet legitimate and neces-
I sary appropriations, and that their servants will
give them, from time to time, a plain, intelligible,
and satisfactory exposition     Instead oí a regular
statement and account, conprehensible to an ordi-
nary mind, they receive an elaborate dissertation
upon the condition of the finances, ps 1 ai abstruse
explicaron of available and unavailable funds     The
veiy laws are an offence to their sense of morality
and their love of truth, becau e thev require tech-
nical misrepresentations of the true state of the
Treasury
Sir, Congress is guilty of gross financia dilapi-
dation, by surrendering the public mone jto irre-
sponsible persons and bodies politic tor their own
use and benefit, instead of keeping it securely m the
Treasury, and but for legal forms and technicali-
ties, would be justly chargeable with peculation
and embezzlement The withering indignaron of
a betrayed and outraged comtnumtv ¡«^prevented
only by imposing on them " a fiction of Jaw" for
"a matter of fact."
Mr Chairman, I have endeavored to show that
the Consti'u ion requires that tne collected revenue
shall be safely kept ia the Treasury of the United
States, and that it cannot be intermediately used or
and command such duties A pa'pabie defect of
power can be supplied only in the mode designa-
ted irt the Constitution it cannot be obviated by
artful contrivance by indirection, and by circu ty
of legislative action No compact, stipulation, or
agreement with these corporations can confer on
Congress, or the Executive, or any department of
this Government, additional powers The autho-
rity of Congress over the subject of finance and
revenue cannot depend, in whole or in part, for its
existence or its exertion, upon the assent or dissent
of bodies politic The consent ot one or more
States cannot empower Congress to do an act not
warranted by the C nsntfftion, nor can the dissent
of one or more States prevent the exercise of apower
clearly granted This doctrine applies « fortiori
to corporations created by the States, and subordi-
nate to their sovereignty
The conclusion is legularly leached, and i> un-
deniable, that the State banks are not, and cannot
become, the Treasury of tne United States, a«= dp-
signed and required by the Constitution itse'f The
corollary from this conclusion is, *nat public money,
placed in the banks on deposite, is not m the Trea-
sury, sife, and ready at every moment, from the
time of it  receipt, to be drawn therefrom, "11 o >r—
sequence of appropriations made by la ," and in-
capable of being subtracted therefrom, m conse-
quence of any thing else It is true, that the Se-
cretary of the Tieasurv annually repoits all that
public money as being in the Treastry nmch s on
deposite, and in possession of the banks and it is
also true that the acts making appropriation-,, re-
gard this public money m the same point of view
But, sir, I think it has been made > "amies in a
previous part of my argument, that \*< s v rn'e y ro-
ceed ng rests upon delusion, and not upon real t ,
upon hy pothesis, and not upon fact, that ir fie a i
conclusions are íequired by ¡he chaiac'er of oar
financial sy stem, and the nature of om leg s'at on
not warranted by the actual condition of the Trea-
sury. Are we to be told tnat there is no dminc'ion
between the actual possession oí money, the real
cash m hand, and a debt due, a mere liability to
pay money I understood my colleague [Mr Gar-
land] as asserting that monev deposed n bank
was just as much in the possession of Government,
as when m the hands 01 its own officers Do you
