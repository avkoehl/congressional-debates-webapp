HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864-8.20 a. m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

The major-general commanding requests me to say that he has ceased working on his intrenchments to-day. In the event contemplated of withdrawing the Fifth Corps from the intrenchments and directing it against the enemy's right flank, could your reserves now working on the redoubts be used in extending your line? It is only in the event of the enemy holding the line of their intrenchments thinly that such operation would be undertaken with the Fifth Corps.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

By ceasing work I could extend my line as far as Burnside's mine and not put the colored troops in the trenches.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff;

I have received orders in case of a movement to co-operate with the Army of the Potomac, and have the honor to report accordingly.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864-5.15 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Shall I occupy part of Burnside's trenches to-night? I can by using all my reserve and stretching take half of Burnside's ground, and he can then by similar means take whole of Warren's. A deserter, in this a. m., states that Lee's forces all gone north of Richmond, and he heard that one division, probably of Beauregard's, left yesterday and the day before.

ORD.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864-5.45 p. m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

Your dispatch received. The information received is not yet sufficient to enable the commanding general to determine upon the arrangements to be carried out to-night. Will let you know as soon as possible.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
