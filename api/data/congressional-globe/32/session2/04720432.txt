THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 28.
vious orders, for the purpose of taking up the bill
for the relief of RulifF Van Brunt. I think there
will be no debate upon it, and that it will pass
without opposition.
Mr. BRADBURY. I shall not object to the
consideration of the bill named by the Senator
from NeSv York, but I would suggest whether it
would not be desirable and expedient that we
should to-day consider those bills from the House
to which no objection shall be made. By pursuing
that course, we shall be able to pass a large num-
ber of bills, and prevent the Senate from exhibiting
the scene of members struggling for the floor to
get up particular bills out of their order. I hope
that course will be pursued. I shall make no ob-
jection to the motion of the Senator from New
โข York provided the bill gives rise to no debate, but
after that bill shall be disposed of, I shall submit
the motion I Jiave intimated.
The motion of Mr. Seward was agreed to, and
the bill was read a second time, and considered as
in Committee of the Whole. It proposes to direct
the proper accounting officers to audit and adjust,
upon the principles of equity and justice, the
claim of Ruliff Van Brunt, for the occupancy of
certain buildings, leased by him in Brooklyn, by
a military force in the service of the United States,
and for property belonging to him. taken and used
or destroyed by those troops in the ygar 1814; and
to pay an amount, not exceeding ยง750, so found
to be due.
Mr. SEWARD. I ask for the reading of the
report of the Committee on Claims. It is very
short, and will explain the whole matter.
The report was accordingly read; from which
it appeared that Van Brunt leased the premises
alluded to from Mr. Jackson,from the 1st of April,
1814, to the 1st of April, 1815, and that he had
them in a state of cultivation with valuable crops;
that they were taken possession of by the twenty-
second brigade of New York Infantry, then in the
service of the United States, and ordered out for
the defense of New York. General Johnson, then
in command, certifies, that on the 2d of September,
1814, his brigade was encamped at Fort Green,
King's county, New York, on the land named.
Mr. Van Brunt's dwelling-house was occupied as
a guard-house. In consequence of the occupation
of his premises by the troops of the United States,
he was compelled to abandon his farm and pro-
cure a house for his family elsewhere. Hence the
committee think him entitled to relief.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read a third time, and passed
PRIVATE BILLS. !
Mr. BRADBURY. I now move that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of the Private Cal-
andar, and consider those House bills to which no
objection shall be made.
Mr. DAWSON. I think we had better take
the calendar regularly. There are bills which
have been upon the calendar since the beginning
of the last session, and it is time they should be
acted upon. We can act on bills from the House
in the last week of the session, and they will then
be passed when we shall have acted upon them.
I know it is said that the House will not pass all
the private bills which we have sent there already
from this body, yet it is due to all claimants that
we should at least give our sanction to the bills re-
ported in their behalf. If they are not passed at
this session of Congress by the House, we, at
least, shall not have to bear the blame, for we shall
have discharged our duty towards the claimants.
Mr. BRADBURY. I will modify my motion,
so as to take up and consider those bills on the
calendar to which no objection shall be made,
rather than have debate upon the question.
Mr. ADAMS. I suggest to the Senator from
Georgia the propriety of going over the Private
Calendar and disposing of those bills to which no
objection shall be made, which will take but a
short time, and then returning to take up the
others in their order.
Mr. DAWSON. I cannot consent to that. Why
should we, in the case of a just claim, pass it by
because some Senator objects to it? I trust we
shall take the bills up in their regular order, and
pass or reject them as they are presented. That
is the rule, and I call for its execution. It must
be suspended to agree to the motion of the Sena- i
tor from Maine.
Mr. BRADBURY. At the last session, we
devoted three or four days to the consideration of
certain bills which were debated at length because
they were thought to be of doubtful character, and
as they were in advance of others on the calendar,
a large number of bills were not reached, and
therefore not considered at all, to which, if they
had been reached, there would have been no ob-
jection.
Now, I ask that we may devote one day to the
bills to which no objection will be made. By this
means we shall gain time to consider those bills
to which the Senator from Georgia alludes. I
hope the motion will prevail, and that we may
devote this day in that way in the trial of the ex-
periment.
The motion was agreed to.
THOMAS H. LEGGETT.
The first private bill on the calendar was the
bill for the relief of Thomas H. Leggett.
Mr. SEBASTIAN. The Senator from Vir-
ginia [Mr. Hunter] takes an interest in that bill.
I have no objection to it myself; but I will repre-
sent that Senator so far as to ask that it may be
passed over.
It was accordingly passed over.
PAYMENT TO THE STATE OF GEORGIA.
Mr. DAWSON. I desire to call the attention
of the Chair to the bill immediately before the one
just considered, and ask if it is not a private bill ?
The PRESIDENT. The Chair is of the opin-
ion that it is not a private bill. It savors very
strongly of a public character. It is a " bill to
' provide for the payment to the State of Georgia,
' for moneys expended by that State for horses
' and equipments lost by volunteers and militia
' whilst engaged in the suppression of the hostili-
' ties of the Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee Indians
' in the years 1836, 1837, and 1838."
Mr. DAWSON. I think it has been treated as
a private bill.
The PRESIDENT. In the opinion of the Chair
it ig" not a private bill.
Mr. DAWSON. It is a bill providing for the
payment to the State of Georgia of certain mon-
eys expended by that State during certain Indian
hostilities, and I presume there will be no objec-
tion to it.
The PRESIDENT. Does the Senator appeal
from the decision of the Chair ?
Mr. DAWSON. Not at all. I never do that,
even if the Chair is wrong. [Laughter.] i
CARMELITE NUNNERY.
The PRESIDENT. The next bill on the cal-
endar is that "for the benefit of the Carmelite
Nunnery of Baltimore," the pending question on
which is on the motion made by the Senator from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Cooper] to reconsider the vote
refusing to order the bill to a third reading.
Mr. ADAMS. I object to that.
The PRESIDENT. It will be passed over.
MARK BEAN AND RICHARD H. BEAN.
The PRESIDENT. The next bill is that for
the relief of Mark Bean and Richard H. Bean, of
Arkansas.
Mr. UNDERWOOD objected to the bill, and
it was passed over.
ROBERT T. NORRIS. j
The Senate proceeded, as in Committee of the
Whole, to the consideration of the bill fer the
relief of Robert T. Norris. It proposes to pay
to Robert T. Norris, in consideration of injuries
received by him while acting as pilot under the
direction of the collector of customs at New York,
Mr. BAYARD called for the reading of the re-
port of the Committee on Commerce; and it was
accordingly read. Prom that report, it appeared
that Robert T. Norris was a regularly-trained and
licensed pilot of New York, and in September,
1839, was directed by the collector of the customs
at that port to pilot the floating-light ship belong-
ing to the United States from the East River to
Sandy Hook. Having performed that duty, and
being engaged in the act of mooring the vessel,
the chain cable slipped out of an open hawser hole
on the port bow, in consequence of one of the
stoppers giving way, and came in contact with
his person, badly injuring his right leg, and so
violently wounding the left, as to render amputa-
tion necessary. By this accident he was disabled I
from pursuing his vocation, and his means of sup-
port were rendered precarious, and he is now in
needy circumstances. Considering' that the acci-
dent happened from some defect or neglect about
the ship for which the pilot was not responsible,
and that the ship belonged to the Government, and
was under its management, the case addresses
itself with so much force to the magnanimity and
justice of the United States, that the committee
say they are not willing to advise its rejection al-
together; but that at the same time they cannot
advise the precedent of granting pensions for in-
juries received in the civil service of the United
States, and they have therefore thought flroper to
submit a bill for the payment of a fixed sum, and
refer to a report made in the House of Representa-
tives in May, 1850, in the case of Ely Darling, as
somewhat analogous, and as covering the prin-
ciple.
Mr. BAYARD. I do not rise for the purpose
of discussing this bill, but I would ask for the
reading of the report No. 213, of the third session
of the Twenty-seventh Congress, made by the
then Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Huntington)
on the same case, and on precisely the same state
of facts. I think that when the Senate hear that
report, they will have very little difficulty in re-
jecting this bill.
The report was read accordingly.
It sets forth that Mr. Norris was one of the
licensed pilots of the port of New York, and as
such, had been for a considerable period previous
to the month of September, 1839, employed to
pilot the ships-of-war, and other vessels of the
United States, in and out of that port when the
services of a pilot were required. This employ-
ment had been given to him in consequence of his
high character for skill and fidelity as a pilot, and
his respectable standing and exemplary conduct
and course of life as a citizen.
Early in the month of September, 1839, the col-
lector of the customs for the port of New York
employed him to pilot the Government light-boat
from the harbor to its station off Sandy Hook. In
the course of the discharge of that duty, and on
the 12th day of that month, the chain-cable of the
boat slipped out of the hawse, caught Mr. Norris
by the legs, so severely lacerated the left one
as to require its immediate amputation above the
knee, severely injured the other leg, and otherwise
imminently endangered his life. Indeed, the tes-
timony shows that he was only liberated from the
confinement of the chain by himself ordering the
hands to cut away the stopper, and let him go
down with the cable.
The consequence of these injuries was a con-
finement from the time of the accident until late in
the month of June after, full three quarters of a
year, and an entire disability forever after of fol-
lowing his profession of a pilot.
The papers contain the most-full and satisfac-
tory testimonials as to the good character, un-
yielding faithfulness, and superior skill and qual-
ifications of Mr. Norris as a pilot, and show that
he has a numerous and dependent family relying
upon the avails of his services for the necessaries
and comforts of life.
All these considerations appeal in the strongest
manner to the feelings and sympathies of the
committee as men, but do not authorize them to
put their hands into the Treasury of the nation
and dispense from it the chanty which the facts
in this case so strongly invoke.
The committee say they have examined with
earnest, yea anxious attention, the report of the
committee of the House which originated the bill,
in the hope that some established and approved
precedent might be there presented, or that some
view of the case might be there taken to change it
from one of a mere appeal to the sympathies of
the Legislature, addressed by a most worthy and
most unfortunate fellow-citizen, and therefore ren-
dering resistance, even of an imperious official
duty, a more thankless and painful one. Still,
they had sought in vain. The report of the com-
mittee of the House did not assume to bring for-
ward a precedent for the bill, the passage of which
it recommends, nor could the committee see that
it placed the claim upon any other ground than
that of worthy sympathy for severe and irremedi-
able misfortune. Upon that ground Mr. Norris
should make his way to the heart and the pocket
of every fellow-citizen possessing the pecuniary
ability to administer to the wants of himself and
