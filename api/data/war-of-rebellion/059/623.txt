New Orleans. Sherman is not in Vicksburg. indications are his force is moving down river. Rumor has it that an expedition is fitting out at Natchez, either for Mobile or up Red River. the enemy have all left Yazoo River. The above is from scouts' report just received. A citizen just out of Vicksburg, who was carried in a prisoner, reports that most of Sherman's army have gone up Red River. The troops which have gone up the Mississippi are mostly furloughed regiments. This is, I consider, reliable.

Lieutenant-General.

DEMOPOLIS, March 14, 1864.

General S. D. LEE, Canton, Miss.:

Your dispatch of the 13th, reporting what you regarded as reliable information concerning enemy's movements, received. All indications lead to the belief that he is now moving from Tennessee River down on Middle Alabama; also that he proposes to repeat his movement from West Tennessee on the prairies in Mississippi. You will therefore leave such force as you may think necessary on the western front, and move promptly with the rest of your command so as to strike Columbus [Pickensville or Warsaw*. Answer immediately.

Lieutenant-General.

DEMOPOLIS, March 14, 1864.

General FORREST, Okolona:

the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-seventh Regiments of Infantry in North Alabama not being under your orders, you will revoke your orders to them, and allow them to do the duty on which they were sent. Order an officer over to Decatur to make a close reconnaissance and send me his report. Have wires extended up to Tupelo or higher up. Established a post there and a line of couriers from that post to the infantry command in North Alabama.
