HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

September 14, 1864-10.30 p.m. (Received 11 p.m.)

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The commanding general wishes to know what was the result of your examination yesterday in reference to throwing forward your pickets, and whether you cannot throw forward the right of your picket-line and get rid of the sharp bend to the rear of the picket-line of the Second Corps. Your dispatch about garrisons and armament received. Please designate them until otherwise directed.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, September 14, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHRYES:

The right of my picket-line was thrown forward yesterday to connect with the left of the Second Corps and preserves about the same relative position with the main line on my right as does the left of the Second Corps line. The whole line can be still farther advanced and get rid of the re-entering angle, but being in the woods is somewhat objectionable. I will direct a further examination to be made in the morning, and, if not otherwise ordered, will advance my right to conform with the Second Army Corps.

JNO. G. PARKE,Major-General.
