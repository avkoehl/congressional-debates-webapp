CAPTAIN: The general commanding directs that you send the Metamora down to Old Point to be turned over to Colonel Biggs, with a note asking him to store the property now on board in some safe place. As soon as your wagons are fairly started you will report here. Send the engineer tools to Captain Pitkin. We have all we need. Captain Butler will hurry up everything and report here as soon as possible. The general desires you to use all dispatch in joining headquarters. We shall need a few more tents. Bring all of our men, guards, &c., sending Lieutenant Smith and a few of them to turn over to Colonel Biggs our things for storage. Every thing has been done in our power to stop the interference of Army of the Potomac headquarters, but in vain. Bring all your assistants. If possible leave some one to forward transportation and join us at once.
