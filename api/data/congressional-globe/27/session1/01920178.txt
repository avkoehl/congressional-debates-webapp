CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. C&A.Y rejoined.   He had alwas been led to
believe that the Senator from New Hampshire was
& matter-of-fact man; but now it appeared he was   .
for creating a Bank without any capital «it all
Mr. WOODBURY replied that the Sub-Trea-
sury had no capital, and yet the Senator from Ken-
tucky had always maintained that the .Sab-Trea-
«ury was a Government Bank.
Mr. ARCHER would give his vote ?gainst the
amendment, by which -he did mean to >e under-
stood as excluding him from vating for auy other
change of amount at another time.
The question was taken on the mom n, and de-
cided in the negative. %
Mr. WRIGHT moved to strhe out the pro
vision in ¡he charter for the increase of t'.e capital
of the Bank, from thirty to fifty millions after 1851.
Mr Wright urged that the condmon [creation
of new share* in the Bank, at ths> end of ten year4*,
would produce an influence in ret  ion to tK  esta
blishment, which would be any thing but ¡ i nducive
toths stability and uniformity which it s^o uvl to be
tiie great object of those in favor of ih concern,
to impart to the business of the country, with which
it was connected. He said that if it was found
profitable, the owners of the thirty miliirn% wield-
ing a va^t power, would opprse the n creav oí
shares, whuh in bringing two thirds ot the sam^
amount of capital to participa* m, ind dim nish the
profits, would be pione lo rest t the m r?«i*e—t^en
there would be a great body of wealti struggling
for ínvestmtní in the Bank, whuh w uld bnn^

proviso for incorporation, at the end of tui yeir^,
would be ío generate a to it and mischievous in-

Mr. CLAY replied at some length, insisting that
if the stock rose it would be an evuieice ot tne
prosperity of iiip establishment and the expe Ik nc/
of increasing the capital Ho referred to the course

fect, and that any amendments ofiere 1 0  t w le
use ess, a«d would only t nd to defoim it T.us
might be excused on account of the relition which
that Senator bore to the measure, but he (Mr W )
and those with who*n he acted, had a duty to per-

Mr. WRIGHT said he had ou or t\ > more,

therein, adjourned.

there was a laige public debt, &c
Ihe result ol bis investigation led him (Mr McK ) to earnest
opposition to the pascase of this bill
Mr HUNTER of Vnsima next addressed the committee
and stated hi* ouject to be to vindicate hmisUf fi m unfounded
charges which had been thrown upon his couise in relation to
the piebcnt Admidistiation ard to expUm the ieasons of his
opposition to the pie^entbill
Heciprcbsediegtetatthe o-der in which the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means had thought pioper to
hung forward the meabUies pi oponed foi the action of the
House at the piesent session The first in order ought to have
been the tax bill, that it might be ascertained what change was
to be made in the tariff then the distribution bill, that it might
be known how the inheritance of the people was to he thrown
away by distributing it among the States, but, more especially,
ought this loan bill to fund the public debt not to have been
brought forward until the amount of additional taxes had been
ascertained But he mustmeet the measures proposed in such
order as it wa3 the good pleasure of the chairman of the Fi
nance Committee to present them for action
\ndn wastothi3loanbiU Mr H was opposed to it, be
cause he was of opinion that if the Secretary of the Treasury
had regard to a lust economy, the financial provisions whi^b
were already m operation before this extra session had been
called would have been sufficient to hare carried on the fiscal
affairs of the country at least until the regular meeting of Con
giess in December The accruing revenue, together with
the six millions in Treasury notes outstanding, would have
been sufficient to meet the current demands of the Treasury
Mr Hunter opposed the bill for an additional reason even
allowing the Secretary to expend all the o'd appropua
lions and all the new which could be needed for this year,
atdl the amount of deficit would be much Ie«s than the twelve
millions for which thi=? hill wa^ asked Mr H went on to
show this by adding the Secietary's estimate of means for 1S41
to the Treasury notes outstanding, the proceeds of the public
lands and the income from the customs, together with abalance
ofS607OOO, which the teecietaiy had admitted, ma communi-
cation to the Sena e, to have been omitted m his report, which,
taken together, would show ¡he current means of the Treasury
for 1841 to he near twenty five millions and a half The lia
bihtiesofthe year, taking ail the appropriations n ade at the
la t Congreas, together with all theTreasuiy note* which the
Secretaty proposed to ledeem, would amount to but between
twenty three and twenty four millions, leaving a surplus in
the hands of the Secietary sufficient to have enabled him to
wait for the opening of the regular session There ought, how
ever, to be subtracted from the amount of Treasury notes to be
ledeemed a little over 1 million foi those which were on an in
terest of six per cení, beexuse the mteiest on these notes did
not, as the gentleman fiom Massac! usotts [Mi Salton&tai.l1
had erroneously stated, cease to run fiom the date when the
notes became due If the ¡secietary had confined himself to the
nth followed, with one exception, by all his predeccssoie, and
confín  d himself to the expenditure oí the tot 1! annual amount
ol appropriations at one session, he would have had money
enough tot airy mm along till Coligiese met The gentleman
from liassachusetta, howevei had told the committee that they
must vot for this bill because they did not know the ac
tnal «state oi the lieasuiy, and the teecretaiy did know it, un
less tht,y could show his ¡statements (on which tho bill was
foundeOtobe enoncous Now Mr IÍ held directly the con
traiy position and maintained that the buulen of proof was on
the Sccretaty and noton the commitfee The Secretary was
boun 1 to show the reasons why he was obliged to spend so
much of the old appropriations How could the committee
judge of that necessity unless it was proved to them by him'i
And was there any thing in the report it elf calculated to con
ciliate for it this implicit confidence^ Where did the gentle
man find it?—-in the eight millions tobe expended over and
above the annual permanent appiopnation^—in the Secre
taiy s omission to state ovei a hall a million of di liars in his
Í obsession?—or was it in 1 ie eager disposition manifested
throughout to involve his Department in as deep an amount
of debt as practu ible? The s-ecretaiy had stated the public
debt to amount to sixteen millions including fout millions to
be retained without nece^ity, in theTrea&ury He admitted
that the amount m Freas uy notes did constitute a debt, but that
debt had heretofore been met by new Treasury notes, a great
part of which would not be pre en ted until alter the opening of
the íegular session Why must we provide for debts beiore
they aie due when we had already given «ur obligations for
tl e amount, and m a more convenient form? Mr H went on
to insist that, even if Congress should authorize the fcecretary
to spend the twenty four millions proposed, the two and a half
millions asked for by the War Department, and the eight hun
died thousand for the Florida wai, still the deficit would not
amount to neai the sum of twelve million* If Gongre&s should
boriowthe twelve millions pioposed the Secretaiy uasalready
atithouzed bylaw to rei^ue Tieasmy notes to the amount
ol five millions and a halt ¡so that ht* wot Id in fact have at
hiftdiopo^il not lest, than^cven een millions anda halfof dollars
Besides what was to become of the Secretary's proposed addi
turn to the tariff by levying a duty of twenty percent on free
goods'* This, according to his own calculation, was to bring
tn five millions and a quarter Did gentlemen propose to give
him six millions of surplus, besides five millions and upw aids of
new means?
But it was not on these srrounds alone that Mr II opposed
this loan bill It was because he saw m the recommendation of
the Secietary the commencement of aseries of measures which
went to efTeet a lovolutionin thecouatry, silent indeed—peace
ful it might be huf working an entire and ladical change mall
the institutions and policy of oui country because he saw the
unfoldings of a system which was, in us results, to take power
from the many and place it m the hands of the few There was
no necessity for creating thirty millions of the United States
stock, nor any intelligible reason lor it, unless to bring upon the
coimtiyahigh protecting tariff and to furnish easier means of
scttinga new Bank ago ng than if its cipital were íequired to
be all paid m in specie While it nvght be a v?ry difficult
thing to put such an institution into operation if the whole of its
vast amount o stock must be fun ished m specie, nothing could
be easier if it were allowed to be lounded on United States
stock
And was he, with the recollection of all the sensations pro
ducedby the chartering of such an institution m his portion of
the Union to be detened fiom opposing it and all cosnate mea
sures, for fear of being charged with dibloyalty to the Constuu
turn? His friend from South Caiohna [Mr Pickens] had sug
gested that equal taxation with unequal distnbution was an evil
m any Government, and had used this consideration as an argu
ment against over burdening the country with taxes, and sad
dling it with the protective system Cm wh ch taxes were twice
paid—once to the Government, and once to the manufacturéis)
ai d for this he had been taken to ta«k by the gentleman from
Penasyivama [Mr Sergeant] and charged with a want of
attachment to the Constitution
Mi H inveighed against the injustice of such a charge,
maintaining that a man might be animated with the utmost
layaltyto the Constitution, and yet disat prove of measures
which were contrary to its spint, andeveiy way inexpedient
Fiom this very question of tax collection and tax distribution
arose the great contests which disturbed the social condition of
civilized man, m our own country and elsewhere   It was a
