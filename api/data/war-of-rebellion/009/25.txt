Captain G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of Navy, Fort Monroe:

It is directed by the President that the Monitor be not too much exposed, and that in no event shall any attempt be made to proceed with her unattended to Norfolk. If vessels can be procured and loaded with stone and sunk in the channel it is important that it should be done. The San Jacinto and Dacotah have sailed from Boston for Hampton Roads, and the Sabine in tow of Baltic, and a tug from New York Gunboats will be ordered forthwith. Would it not be well to detain the Minnesota until other vessels arrive?
