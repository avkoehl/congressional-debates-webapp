Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: You are directed to have a transport (either a steamer or sailing vessel as may be deemed proper by the Quartermaster- General) sent to the colored colony established by the United States at the island of Vache, on the coast of San Domingo, to bring back to this country such of the colonists there as desire to return. You will have the transport furnished with suitable supplies for that purpose, and detail an officer of the Quartermaster's Department who, under special instructions to be given, shall have charge of the business. The colonists will be brought to Washington, unless otherwise hereafter directed, and be employed and provided for at the camps for colored persons around that city. Those only will be brought from the island who desire to return, and their effects will be brought with them.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

You will please proceed to carry this order into execution, and report to me the name of a suitable officer of your department to whom the special instructions mentioned by the President may be given.

Your obedient servant,

EDWIN M. STANTON,
