40th Cong. ... 3d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Ho. of Khps.
1868, increased $35,625,102 82. Of this in-
crease $24,152,000 is chargeable to the Pacific
railroads, and 37,200,000 lo the purchase of
itussian America. Within the same period
there was paid for bounties $44,060,515, and
at least §4.000,000 tor interest on compound
ami seven three tenth notes, which had ac-
crued prior to the 1st of November, 1867. If
these extraordinary advauces and payments
had not been made the receipts would have
exceeded the expenditures §43,787,412 18.
Considering the heavy reduction of internal
taxes, made at the last session of Congress,
and the large expenditures which have attended
the military operations against the Indians on
the frontier, and the maintenance of large
forces at expensive points in the southern
States, thi3 statement of the amount of the
debt cannot be regarded an unsatisfactory one.
The bounties will, it is expected, be entirely
paid within the next three months, and very
little interest, except that which accrues upon
the funded debt, is hereafter to be provided
for. Should there be henceforth no extraor-
dinary expenditures, and no further donations
of public moneys in the form of bounties or
of additional subsidies to railroad companies,
with proper economy in the administration of
the General Government, and with judicious
amendments of the revenue laws and proper
enforcement thereof, the public debt, without
oppressive taxation, can be rapidly diminished
and easily extinguished within the period here-
tofore named by the Secretary.
The ability of the United States to maintain
their integrity against insurrection as well as
against a foreign enemy can no longer be
doubted. The question of their ability, under
democratic institutions, to sustain a large na-
tional debt, is still to be decided. That this
question should be affirmatively settled, it is,
in the opinion of the Secretary, of the highest
importance that the tax-paying voters should
be encouraged by the fact that the debt is in
the progress of rapid extinguishment and is
not to be a permanent burden upon them and
their posterity. If it be understood that this
debt is to be a perpetual incumbrance upon
the property and industry of the nation, it is
certainly to be feared that the collection of
taxes necessary to pay the interest upon it may
require the exercise of power by the central
Government inconsistent with republicanism
and dangerous to the liberties of the people.
The debt must be paid. Direct repudiation
is an impossibility; indirect repudiation, by
further issues of legal-tender notes, would be
madness. To insure its payment without a
change in the essential character of the Gov-
ernment every year should witness a reduction
of its amount and a diminution of its burdens.
The Secretary is confident that he expressed
the sentiments of the intelligent tax-payers of
the country when lie said in his report of 1865:
, "The debt is large, but if kept at home, as it is de-
sirably it should be, with ajuiliciou? system of taxa-
tion. it need not be oppressive. It is, however, a
debt. While it is capital to the holders of theseeuri-
ties, it is still a national debt, and an incumbrance
upon the national estate. Neither its advantages
nor its burdens are or can be shared or borne equally
by the people. Its influences are anti-republican,
it adds to tlio power ot the Executive by increasing
federal patronage; it mu-t be distasteful to the peo-
ple, because it tills the couutry with informers and
tax-gatherers. It is dangerous to the public virtue,
because it involves the collection and disbursement
ot vast sums of money, and renders rigid national
economy almost impracticable. It is, in a word, a
national burden, and the work of removing it, no
matter how desirable it may be for individual invest-
ment, should not long be postponed.
As all true men desire to leave to their heirs un-
incumbered estate*, so should it be the ambition of
the people of the United States to relieve their de-
scendants of this national mortgage. "We need not
be anxious that future genciatious shall share the
burden with us. Wars aro not at an end. and pos-
terity will ha\ e enough to do to take care of tho debts
0 ".v,'n cre itiuii.
liio Secretary respectfully suggests that on this
subject tile expression of Congress should be decided ■
aim empsnitie. It is of the greatest importance in
;Pe tnanagement of a matter of so surpassing interest
that tho right start should bo made. Nothing but
revenue will sustain the national credit, and noth-
ingJess than a fixed policy for the reduction of the
public deot will be likely to prevent its increase."
And in his report of 1867, when he remarked:
"Old debts are hard debts to pay; the longer they
are continued the more odious they become. If the
present generation should throw the burden of this
debt upon the next, it will be quite likely to be
handed down from one generation to another, a per-
petual if not a constantly increasing burden upon
the people. Our country is tuil ot enterprise and
resources, Tho debt will be lightened every year
with great rapidity by the increase of wealth and
population. With a properreduction in the expenses
ot the government, and with a revenue system
adapted to_ the industry of the country, and not
oppressing it, the debt may be paid before the expi-
ration of the present century. The wisdom of a
policy which shall bring about such a result is vin-
dicated, in advance, by the history of nations whose
people are burdened with inherited debts, and with
no prospcct of relief for themselves or their pos-
terity."
In bis last report the Secretary referred to
the condition of the Treasury at the close of
the war and at some subsequent periods,
alluding especially to the emergency in the
spring of 1865, arising from the very large
requisitions which were waiting for payment,
and the still larger requisitions that were to be
provided for, to enable the War Department
to pay arrearages due to the Army, and other
expenses which had already been incurred in
the_ suppression of the rebellion. In briefly
reviewing the administration of the Treasury
from April, 1865, he did not think it necessary
to state how much of the large revenue receipts
had been expended in the payment of debts
incurred during the war; and he would not
undertake to do it now did not misapprehen-
sion exist in the public mind in regard to the
expenditures of the Government since the con-
clusion of hostilities, prejudicial to both the
law-making and the law-executing branches
of the Government.
The war was virtually closed in April, 18G5.
On the first day of that month the public debt
amounted, according to the books and accounts
of the Department, to $2,866,955,077 34. On
the 1st day of September following it amounted
to $2,757,689,571 43, having increased in four
months $390,734,494 09. From that period it
continued to decline until November 1, 18G7,
when it had fallen to $2,491,504,450. On the
1st day of November last it had risen to
$2,527,129,552 82. By this statement it ap-
pears that between the 1st day of April, 1865,
and the 1st day of September of the same year,
the debt increased §390,734,494 09, and that l
between the 1st day of September, 1865, and jj
the 1st day of November, 1868, it decreased ;j
8230,560,018 61 ; and that on the last day jj
mentioned it was $160,174,475 48 larger than "
it was on the 1st day of April, 1865. Since '
then the Treasurer's receipts from all sources .
of revenue have been as follows : <
For April, May, and June. I860  $83,519,164 13 ;s
For the year ending J une 30,1866  553.032,620 06 1 i
For the year ending June 31), 1867  490,634.010 27 ji
For the year ending June 30, IS68  t05.638.0S3 32
June 30 to November 1,1868  124,652,181 42 j
Total of receipts  1,662,476,062 20
To which should be added the in-
crease of the debt between thel*t
day of April, 1865. and the 1st day
of November, 1868 ,4.  160,174.475 48
$1,822,650,587 68
This exhibit shows that the large sum of
$1,822,650,537 68 was expended in the pay-
ment of the interest and of other demands
upon the Treasury in three years and seven
months, being an annual average expenditure
of $508,646,661 68.
If the statement of the public debt on the
1st day of April, 1865, had included all debts
due at that time, and $1,822,650,537 68 had
really been expended in payment of the interest
oti the public debt, and the current expenses
of the Government between that day and the
1st day of November last, there would have
been a profligacy and a recklessness in the
expenditures of "the public moneys discredit-
able to the Government and disheartening to
tax-payers. Fortunately this is not the fact,
That statement—as is true of all other monthly
statements of the Treasury—exhibited only the
adjusted debt, according to the books of the
Treasury, and did not, and could not, include
the large sums due to the soldiers of the great
Union Army—numbering at that time little
less than a million men—for "pay" and for
'•bounties," or on claims of various kinds
which must of necessity have been unsettled.
For the purpose of putting this matter right
the Secretary has endeavored to ascertain from
the War and Navy Departments how much of
their respective disbursements, since the close
of the war, has been in payment of debts
properly chargeable to the expenses of the war.
The following is the result of his inquiries:
By the War Department $595,431,125 90
By the Navy Department  35,000,000 00
It has been impossible to obtain an exact
statement of the amount of such debts paid by
the Navy Department, but sufficient informa-
tion has been received to justify the Secretary in
estimating it in round numbers at $35,000,000,
which is probably an under rather than over
estimate. The expenditures of the War De-
partment have been furnished in detail, and
are believed to be substantially correct.
These figures show that the money expended
by the War and Navy Departments, between
the 1st day of April, 1865, and the 1st day of
November, 1868, on
Claims justly chargeable to the expenses of the war,
amounted to  $630,431,125 SO
To which should beailded aniountad-
vanced to the Pacific roads  42.19t,000 00
Amount paid for Alaska  7,200,(W0 00
$670,825,125 90
Deducting this sum from the amount of the
revenues, $1,662,476,0(52 20, and $160,17-4,-
475 48, the increase of the public debt, the
remainder, $1,142,825,411 78, or an average
of $318,928,021 89 per annum, is the amount
actually expended in the payment of current
expenses and interest.
It is thus shown that within a period of
three years and seven months the revenues,
or the receipts from all sources of revenue,
reach the enormous sum of $1,662,496,062 20,
and that $630,431,125 90 were paid on debts
which were actually due at the close of the
war, and for bounties which, like the pay of
the Army, were a part of the expenses of the
war. Adding the amount thus paid to the
debt, as exhibited by the books of the Treas-
ury on the 1st day of April, 1865, it appears
that the debt of the United States at that time
was $2,997,386,203 24, and that the actual
reduction has been $470,256,650 42; and but
for the advances to the Pacific roads, and the
amount paid for Alaska, would have been
$519,050,650 42.
Nothing can better exhibit the greatness of
the resources of this young nation than this
statement, or show more clearly its ability to
make ''short work" ofthe extinguishment of
the public debt. It will be borne in mind that
these immense revenues have been collected
while one third part of the country was in a
state of great destitution, resulting from its
terrible struggle to separate itself from the
Union, with its political condition unsettled
and its industry in a great degree paralyzed ;
and while also the other two thirds were slowly
recovering from the drain upon their product-
ive labor and resources, a necessary accom-
paniment of a gigantic and protracted war.
The Secretary has noticed with deep regret
indications of a growing sentiment m (Jon-
gress—notwithstanding the favorable exhibits
which have been from time to time made of
the debt-paying power of the country—in favor
of a postponement ofthe payment of any part
ofthe principal of the debt, until the national
resources shall be so increased as to make the
payment of it more easy. ]f this sentiment
