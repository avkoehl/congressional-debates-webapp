. APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 3.
34th Cong....1st Sess.
Marine Hoipitah—Reform—Mr. Campbell, of Ohio.
Ho. of Reps.
sick and disabled seamen are cared for at one half
the expense of the other.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. If that is
the case at Pittsburg, where there is an organized
hospital, what will the gentleman say of Pensa-
cola, where the sick and disabled seamen are
cared for at a private establishment at a cost of
$2 20 a day?
Mr. CAMPBELL. The jrentleman is taking
me around to Pensacola, while I am considering
the condition of things upon the western waters,
Mr. WASHBURNE. Then I will take the
case of Memphis, where it costs the Government
$1 15 a day.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Well, take Memphis at
$1 15 without a building, and Natchez at $10 10
with a Government hospital, and tell me how i
you justify your course. • |
I lake the whole under each system and group
them together, and show you that the expense
at the organized hospitals is twenty-four dollars the
week, while on the other plan it is only $4 40 the
week. That is the only correct way to test the
merits of the two systems. Gentlemen may per-
haps pick out individual instances, and get facts
to support their case; but the true test is that
which I have adopted.
Mr. KENNETT. I would asK the gentleman
if he is not aware of the fact that it has been the
habit of the Government, where they could not
get accommodations cheap enough, to make no
provisions for that class at all ? In the city of
St. Louis, L happen to know, having had some-
thing to do with the municipal affairs of that city,
the sick seamen are handed around from pillar to
post—from the surveyor and inspector of the port
to the city authorities—from the city authorities
to the city hospital, and finally are taken up by
individuals, and provided for by them; or they
could not have got support at all.
Air. CAMPBELL. That may be very pos-
sible. But past neglect on the part of Govern-
ment officials is not by any means an argument
against the system proposed here, because this
proviso simply gives the Secretary discretionary
power to lease the Government hospitals for the
purpose of affording relief.
Mr. DUNN. Will the gentleman from Ohio
allow me a word or two.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Certainly.
Mr. DUNN. I have no doubt, from what has
been shown here, that very great and shameful '
abuses and frauds are practiced on the Government i
in connection with these marine hospitals. The \
arguments and facts presented by the gentleman
from Ohio make that clear enough. But I beg the .
gentleman's attention to another point. These
seamen are, so to sneak, the children of the nation.
I They have abandoned their homes and their
! friends, severed the ties of home and kindred, and
i when sick they have no resource unless the nation
' provides it for them. They have no nursing wife
or mother, or other friend, when wasting disease
strikes them down—they have given themselves
up wholly to this perilous service of their coun-
try—a service in its very nature which deprives
them of all thought ofeconomy, providence or care.
As they have thus become the charge of the na-
tion, and as the nation should nourish them in
affliction, ought they to be abandoned to the cold
cruelties—I will not say charities—of the traffick-
ing, moneys-hunting world, or should they not
rather be taken care of by the nation, at whatever
cost ?
Mr. CAMPBELL. Certainly.
Mr. DUNN. I thought my friend would not
controvert the obligations of Government in such
a matter. Then does this proposition remove the
difficulty? Does it not only change the abuse,
and probably make it worse ? The suggestions
of the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Kennett]
point to cases of neglect and suffering which passed
under his own observation for the want of Govern-
ment hospitals. Will this proposition remedy such
| cases? or may we not fear they will be increased ?
j This is the branch of the subject I wish to have
; made clear, if it can be.
; Mr. CAMPBELL. This bill does not propose
to cast out into the world the sick seaman. No,
sir; no ! It is designed to secure to these children
of the nation better care than they are now receiv-
ing. You are taxing them by law at the rate of
twenty cents a month, and then you are squan-
dering their money. That is what we complain of
in their behalf. That wrong we wish to remedy.
Our proposition is to change the system, so as to
provide for them greater comforts at less expense
to them and the Treasury. And we ask your
support of the measure. I think that the facts
show conclusively that the Committee of Ways ;
and Means are right in their effort. Why, I ask I
emphatically, why are we met with this unrelent-
ing opposition ?
Mr. DUNN. These abuses evidently grow
out of the cupidity of men; and if you hire out
these charities, do you not incur the same chances
of abuse ?
Mr. CAMPBELL. It strikes me that if the
gentleman from Indiana had paid attention to the
facts which I was presenting, there would have
been no necessity for that inquiry, because I have
shown that at New York the expenses are only
forty-eight cents per day, while at Pittsburg- they
are $1 53 per day, and at Natchez about one hun-
dred and fifty dollars per week ! Will gentlemen
undertake to say that at New York, at Philadel-
phia, at Cincinnatti, or at Baltimore, the seamen
are not provided for quite as well as they are at
Natchez, in Mississippi, or at Napoleon, in
Arkansas, or at any other port where the Gov-
j ernment has built a marine hospital ?
!| Mr. WASHBURNE. At the ports of New
; York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore hospitals were
already established by the cities; at other points
where the Government established hospitals there
are no local hospitals, and no means of taking
care of seamen.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Perhaps there are no people
there! There can be no very large number of
disabled seamen at any point where there are not
people enough and commercial interests sufficient-
1 Iy great to make provision for the sick and build
hospitals. The inference is very natural that
there is no pressing demand on the Government
to build an hospital for sailors in any locality,
, simply to have money expended, in order to
i make room for sinecure matrons, stewards, phy-
l sicians, nurses, though people may not have made
provisions for other classes.
Mr. KENNETT. Allow me to call attention
to another fact. It is this: The gentleman has
said that this money comes out of the pocket of
the nation. I happened to be connected with
this business, and know 
Mr. CAMPBELL. During the last fiscal year
the amount collectedfrom seamen, &c., was about
1 $149,000, and this bill appropriates $150,000.
With these facts before honorable gentlemen, I do
not see how they can consent to strike this reform
clause from the bill.
Mr. KENNETT. Yes; but I was going to
say that although the sailor must pay this twenty
cents a month, it is paid out of the pockets of
the boat-owners, when the boat takes out her
clearance at the custom-house; and when the men
are paid their money, there is in a great many
instances no call upon them.
Mr. CAMPBELL. The officers of the boats
may pay it; but 1 doubt not it is charged up to
the seamen on settlement. The point of trouble
is not so much how it is paid, in as how it is void
o^U! *
Mr. Chairman, I have discharged my duty in
exposing this matter to-day, and I leave it to the
action of the committee and the House to decide
whether the proposed work of reform meets their
approbation.
