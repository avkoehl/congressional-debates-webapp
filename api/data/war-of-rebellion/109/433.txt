STEVENSON, August 8, 1863.

General GARFIELD:

I examined Capertons' Ferry. The river is about 800 yards wide. Approaches excellent. Road from Stevenson to ferry good; ferry guarded by one regiment of rebel cavalry, Third Confederate.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

What is the nature of the shore on the opposite side of Caperton's Ferry? Can the enemy be readily dislodged from his position?

STEVENSON, August 8, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

Opposite side densely timbered, timber very heavy; bank on opposite side a little lower than on this. The best road to Will's Valley is the Bellefonte and Lebanon; it is represented as being a good mountain road.

Major-General.

CAMP NEAR WINCHESTER,

August 8, 1863.

Major-General STANELY:

SIR: There is a steam-boat used by the rebels upon Holston River. She is a stern-wheeler, capable of carrying about sixty or eighty tons. I saw her at Knoxville while I was a prisoner; she landed in view from the jail window. I was told that there was another in the same trade. The rebels do not keep a guard on her. Thinking that these boats would now be of service as ferries and transports, I thought best to report them to you. I would respectfully suggest that I can pick ten men out of this regiment who can go and bring one or both to any point you may order. Please send an order to the regiment detailing me as a scout. Captain Casper would not give me the pass your ordered until I was detailed. I would also report that the bridge over the Ocmulgee River at Macon, Ga., and one over the Altamaha, on the Savannah River, both need burning very bad. All the rebel transportation to the east that does not go by Knoxville goes by Savannah.

I am, sir, with respect,

JAMES PIKE,

Corporal Company A, Fourth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry.
