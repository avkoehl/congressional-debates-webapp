a movement of the enemy to cut off the command from the mountains, I thought it best t to fall back to the pass in the mountain.

One of the enemy is known to be badly wounded. None of my men were hurt.

Taking possession of the mountain pass, I remained there some time expecting the enemy would follow, but saw nothing further of them.

I found the roads in good condition. I found a sufficient quantity of water along the way to supply the troops passing over the mountain.

But little information could be obtained from persons along the rout. From the clothing found I learned the troops in Trenton belonged to the Fourth Alabama Cavalry. I also learned that a force of our cavalry occupied Trenton for a short time yesterday. They returned to the valley by some other road, and I did not see them.

My detachment arrived safely in camp at this place at 6 p.m. this evening.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
