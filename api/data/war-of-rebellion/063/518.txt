6. On the march of the troops of this army from this point it is absolutely indispensable that all straggling or leaving the ranks for unauthorized purposes be prevented. Commanding officers of regiments and detachments will be held strictly responsible that no men of their commands leave their places in ranks except on account of sickness or for necessary purposes, in which cases passes must be given to show that they are unavoidably out of the column. When the army commences its movements the chief of cavalry will order a sufficient number of men to patrol the town of Alexandria to prevent any building being set fire to or any other act that can advertise the movement to the enemy and to force any stragglers forward to their commands. Upon the advance guard of the army [cavalry] coming to any town, plantation, or buildings, the commanding officer will detach a sufficient number of men to remain at such places to keep the men from falling from the ranks. As soon as the army has passed the guards will fall in with the rear guard until a halt, when they will pass to the head of the column at a walk to rejoin their regiments. Nothing tends to the inefficiency of an army more than straggling. Commanding officers must use every exertion to stop an evil of such magnitude, which has already made its appearance, from spreading or gaining any foothold in their commands.

By command of Major-General Banks:
