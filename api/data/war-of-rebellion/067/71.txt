two armies are now concentrated upon the main road from Fredericksburg to Richmond. The rebels appear to be massed about the Court-House, where they have twenty cannons in position to bear upon the road. Their works, however, do not seem to extend far to left of the Court-House. Yesterday their trains were moving in the direction of Guiney's Station, where they apparently have a depot of supplies. Our pickets in front of Wright's lines are about 2 miles distant from the road leading to Guiney's. A brigade of rebel cavalry has appeared here within the last two days, but has done us no damage. General Grant desires that Major Morton, of the Corps of Engineers, should be sent here to report to General Burnside. Captain Harris, of the Ordnance Corps, now serving with General Burnside, might be advantageously employed elsewhere. Burnside has no more occasion for an ordnance officer than any other corps commander.
