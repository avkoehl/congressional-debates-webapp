GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 79. New Berne, May 19, 1863.

In obedience to orders from the War Department Brigadier General E. A. Wild, U. S. Volunteers (a gallant and accomplished soldier and gentleman), has arrived in this department for the purpose of raising a brigade of colored troops. General Wild will establish recruiting offices at such points as he may select, and all district commanders, commanding officers of posts, and other officers and men, are hereby enjoined and ordered to afford to General Wild, his officers and men, every facility and aid in the performance of their duties and in carrying out fully and in good faith the orders of the Government.

The commanding general expects that this order will be sufficient to insure the prompt obedience (the first duty of a soldier) of all officers and soldiers in this department to the orders from the War Department.

By command of Major General J. G. Foster:

[SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT MONROE, May 20, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

The Baltimore Sun of Monday says we are taking up the track of the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad from Carrsville to the junction of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad. The writer of this letter is not here; when he returns I shall see to it. The rails on the Seaboard road weigh 158 tons per mile; those on the Petersburg road 246 tons per mile. Of course it will require time to remove them. The operation on the later road will amount to a campaign and we must look for some sharp fighting, for I do not believe 5,000 tons of railroad iron will in the present emergency be given up without a contest.

All quiet at West Point. Gordon needs more guns, and one of his regiments goes shortly. How are you getting on?

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
