HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, N. C., March 17, 1865.

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I respectfully report that I left camp at daylight this morning and pushed out on the road as taken by General John E. Smith. The roads were very heavy, so much so as to require almost continuous corduroying. The work was done well, so that I know the train under charge of Brevet Brigadier-General Woods will pass over that portion of his route without interruption. Reaching the fork of the road near General Smith's camp, I turned to the left and followed in his rear, reaching my camp at such an hour as to give me everything in snug before dark this evening. At the fork of the road near General Smith's camp of last night I detached one of my regiments and sent it down the right-land road to the point directed by Major-General Logan, commanding corps. The regiment reported at camp to-night, having accomplished the object desired. There was no sign of the enemy at the crossing. My troops cover the road leading to Beaman's Cross-Roads, my headquarters being on the main road just in rear of line.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
