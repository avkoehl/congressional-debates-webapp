HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, May 29, 1864.

General McPHERSON,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee, Dallas:

GENERAL: When you move, take with your wagons all Confederate wounded that will bear transportation to be sent to Kingston and the rear, and leave those too severely wounded in Dallas, attended by a medical officer of theirs, if there be one in your possession, or of some one or more useless prisoners. You had better leave Dodge's command at Owen's Mill brigade and the point where you enter this road, and relieve Hooker's corps with the Fifteenth Corps, and afterwards bring up part of Dodge's. Let Davis come ahead or parallel with you and proceed to General Palmer on our left. General Thomas has examined all the ground and finds it most favorable to our movement.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General McPHERSON,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: I suppose General Blair to be now near Rome. I wish you to send a good staff officer to meet him there or at Kingston and order him to replenish his stores and march for Allatoona Pass, east of the Etowah, to gain, if possible, its eastern terminus and then intrench his position. He had better march from Kingston four miles southeast to the Free Bridge, cross the Etowah, and move for Allatoona, via Euharlee and Stilesborough. This route will deceive the enemy as to his purposes till the latest moment possible. Once in possession of Allatoona, I wish him to order the railroad superintendent, who is already at Resaca, to repair the railroad up to Allatoona, including the Etowah or Hightower bridge. General Blair should also construct on the dirt road a trestle bridge at the same crossing.

I am, with great respect, yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Dallas, Ga., May 29, 1864.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, Rome, Ga.:

GENERAL: You will move with your command, as rapidly as possible, from Rome to Allatoona, in accordance with the instructions of Major-General Sherman, herewith inclosed.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
