tion between the two parties was bank or no bank.
He read an extiact from a report made to this
House, two years ago, which was thougnt to be
so excellent an argument in favoi of the recharter
of the bark, that a large number of copies were
distributed by the bank In this passage the wri-
ter laid down, in broad terms, the very principles
on which the Secretary of the Treasury claimed
tne right to remove the deposites He also re'encd
to the opinions of Mr. Sergeant ard Mr McLane
as authority for the measure The argument then
was, that the Legislatuie htid no right to investí
gate the concerns of the bank, or in any way to
interfere with it In relation to the selection of
the places of depositing the public money, he had
only to say that, before the establishment of the
bank, the Secretaiy of the Treasury exercised the
exclusive contiol of this subject Tne Secretaries
of the Treasury had exercised the power, without
dispute, oftrar.sfei ring the public money fiom one
bank to another, and choosing what banks they
pleased as Us depository
In conclusion of the remarks, of which the
above is a very slight sketch, Mi P strongly
expressed the opinion that this was a contest
between the Constitution and the laws on one
hand, and a moneyed oligarchy on the other
Mr. GHOLSON obtained the floor, and signi-
fied a wish to speak on the subject, but as the
hour was very late, he would detei his remarks
for the present    On bis motion,
The House then adjourned.

Mr POINDEXTER, from the select committee
to whom was íeferred the credentials of the Hon
Asher Robbihs and Elisha R Potter, on the
subject of the contest between those* two gentle-
men for a seat in the Senate, made a report, which i
Mr P read at the Secretary'stable, adverse to the
claims of Mr Potter, and favorable to the right
of Mr  Robbins, the sitting member, to his seat
After the report had been read,
Mr POINDEXTER said he declined making
any observations upon the subject now He
merely wished to move the printing of the report
and the documents He understood that the mi-
nority of the committee wanted to submit a counter
repoit, and he wished to give them time for that
puipose, and when the report came up for con-
I sideration he would submit his views
' Mr. WR1GH fsaid heWs bound, injustice to
himself and to the honoiabie Senator from Vn-
gmia, [Mi Rives,] who, it would be recollected
ty the Senate, wa3 a member of this select com-
mittee, but who had, upon a late day, resigned his
seat m this body, to state a few facts in relation to
the proceedings of the committee According to
his lecollection, the meeting of the committee to
decide the impoitantmatteis referred to it was held
three weeks ago on Saturday last At that meet-
ing the views of each member of the committee
were fully expressed, and it was found that him-
self and nis honorable fnend fiom Virginia enter-
tamed the same opinions, and that their opinions
diffeied with those entertained by the other three
members of the committee He (Mr W ) then
undeistood that the report of tne majority of the
committee would be drawn up and submitted to
the minority at a much earlier period, but he found
no fault with the treatment which the minority of
the committee had rece ved from the majority
He knew from his o.wn experience how little time
any member of the Senate could get, from his
othei duties, to think and wnte upon subjects im-
portant as those submitted tothis select committee.
The honorablechairman of the committee, as much
pressed with other official duties as any otnei
member of the body, had found it necessary to
retain the papers upon which the report was to be
predicated until the present time, to enable him to
draw up the report of the majority of the com
mittee, and his (Mr W 'a) knowledge of the case
enabled him to &ay, that no peison could write a
report upon this subject without the possession of
the papéis before the committee Such had been
the course peimitted to the parties by the com
mittee, that those papéis weie indispensable in
drawing a report taking either side of the great
question
He, (Mr W ,) by the resignation of the gentle-
man fiom Viigmia, was now left alone as the mi
nority oí the committee, and unexpectedly the laboi
of diawing up a report, expi easing the opinion of
the minority of the committee, was devolved upon
him, a3 before the resignation of the honorable
Senatoi, it was understood between them, that
that able and much more competent individual
should perfoi m that labor He (Mi W ) should
have asked the Senate to elect a member of the
committee to fill the vacancy occasioned by the
lesi  nation of his honorable fnend, had it not been
foi the fact that the case had been finally decided
by the committee before that event happened, but,
with his best reflection upon the subject, he had
come to the conclusion that placing at this late
period of their action, a new member upon the
1 committee , would give little aid to their delibera-
tions, while it would impose an arduous labor upon
some member of the Senate
A question had been suggested in the committee
as to the right, under the i ules and practice of the
Senate, of the minonty of its committees to submit
a report. His present object was to say, that
himself and his colleague before named upon the
committee, had discussed this subject, and in view
of the importance of *he questions involved, they
had consideied it to be their duty to present their
views to the Senate, in case it should be considered
admissible for (hem to do so He was aware that
he ought to have been prepared, at this time,.to
submit those views, but want of possession of the
papers had prevented him from having made that
preparation, and his expectation, enteitained until
one week ago on Saturday last, that the Senator
fiom Virginia would perform the labor, furnished
another reason for his want of preparation
He would now submit to the Senate the dispo
sition of the whole matter, declaung his disposi-
tion, according to his best ability, to discharge his
duty as a membei of the committee, but entertaining
no feelings as to the course which the Senate should
indicate The honorable chairman had moved the
pnnungof the report of the majority, and if the Sen -
ate should so order, and no other expression should
be made, he should feel it to be his duty, as soon as
he could obtain the possession of the papéis from
the committee, to draw up a repoit containing the
views of the minority of the committee, so fai as
they came in conflict with those which had been
given to the Senate by the majority Still, if such
a report would not be received by the Senate, he
desired to be saved the labor of maismg it, and,
therefore,he hoped such expression would be now
made as might direct him as to his duiy. For
himself, he felt no anxiety whatever, but rather
íegretted that this responsible duty had devolved
upon him, but under thecucumbtances, and stand-
ing alone in the minority, he felt so strongly the
importance pf the questions, that he should not
shank from the attempt to present his views of
them, in case they would be received by the Sen-
ate, and in that event those views should be pre-
sented at the earliest day at which his other duties,
and the possession of the papers, would enable
him to give them
Mr CLAY said, that the time had arrived for
proceeding to the orders of the day, but he would
say, that the parliamentary propriety of allowing
a counter repoit of a committee, no doubt, was
not warranted by usage, as it had been applied in
this country, until within a few years past. As
regarded tne practice oi the Senate on this subject,
he did not know what it was, but he thought it a
bad one to introduce He had no objection to re-
ceiving the leport of the minority, but he wished
now to move the postponement of the subject till
to-morrow, and proceed to the consideration of the
special order
Mr KING, of Alabama, said he was aware
that, until a late period, it was not the practice to
present counter reports, it grew up in the House
of Representatives, and this morning there were
two reports made io that body on the same sub-
ject A few years since, the question was raised
in this body A Senator from South Carolina
presented a majority report on the subject of re-
ducing the duty on impoited iron; a Senator fiom
New Jersey presented the minority report on the
permission of the Senate Tne report was received
for the pui pose of enabling the minority fairly and
fully to express their views and opinions He
hoped the view of the gentleman fiom Kentucky
would not be carried into effect. If the report
could be sent back to the committee, so that the
opinions of both the majority and minority could
be presented m one view, he thought it would be
the preferable course
Mr CLAY said the-sentleman from Alabama
misunderstood him He was not opposed to a
minority report He only said the practice was
unparliamentary The gentleman relied upon a
single precedent, and Mr C would submit whether
a single precedent ought to contiol the Senate now
and hereafter As he understood that case, a paper
was repoited by a mojonty, and another bv the
minority In this instance, he would prefer allow-
ing a minority report, but at the same lime with an
expression of opinion that it should not be con-
sidered as a general rule, because he thought it a
bad one But he hoped the subject would be post-
poned till to-morrow, an¿ thegentleman fiom New
Hampshire, who had the floor, be allowed to pro-
ceed in the speech which he had begun upon the
special order
Mr POINDEXTER thanked the gentleman
from Alabama for referring to the precedent He
was quite willing that the minority should have an
opportunity to make their report.
Mr SPRAGUE was very unwilling the minor-
ity should be deprived of the opportunity of
making a counter report But he thought it could
not be yielded to them as a matter of right He
would rather lay-down a piospective rule, than
appeal to the present. He hoped such a course
would be adopted as would enable the gentle-
man from New York [Mr Wright] to make his
report, as he believed, from his statement, that he
would have had much difficulty before in doing
so
Mr CLAYTON understood the proposition of
the gentleman from Alabama was, to recommit the
whole subject, which he was opposed to He
hoped every facility would be given the gentleman
from New York to make his report, but he thought
the rule, as a matter of practie-e, objectionable, as
it would in every case of difference of opinion in a
committee, enable a minority to obstruct and delay
the action of a majority He thought it better to
print the report, and give an opportunity to th-
gentleman to examine it and the documents, and
then submit his report.
