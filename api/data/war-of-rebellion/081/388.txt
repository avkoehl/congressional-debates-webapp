Major-General WRIGHT.

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Your dispatch of 10.15 a.m. is received. The commanding general directs that the pickets go forward, and that they be well supported. They must keep up connection with General Birney's pickets, which are also ordered forward. When your pickets have secured sufficient ground the commanding general directs that your line of battle be moved forward connecting with General Birney's, whose left will be moved to correspond with your right. You will leave the two brigades of the Fifth Corps where they are now posted, and dispose your left flank to give security to your line of battle.

A prisoner taken on your left this morning states that he was sent last night to General Mahone's headquarters with 300 prisoners, taken from our picket-line by surprise while rations were being issued. The commanding general wishes this to be inquired, and if found to be well founded, that the officer responsible be held to strict accountability.
