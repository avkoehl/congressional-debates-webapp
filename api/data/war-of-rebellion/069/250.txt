fortified front. If the brigade was attacked by a strong force it would be obliged to fall back under very disadvantageous circumstances, or it would be necessary to move to its support, and so shift the battle-ground from the intrenched and studied line to a new one, where we would have no advantage of position.

Respectfully,

WINF'D. S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 27, 1864-6 p.m. (Received 7.30 p.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

You can halt your column at dark, leaving at 4 a.m. to-morrow. You will follow the Sixth Corps, whose route has been slightly changed and who will perhaps cross the river above Hanovertown. When you halt report your position. Headquarters are at the Mangohick Church. The cavalry were across at 9 o'clock this morning and Russell at 11 a.m. All quiet when last heard from, though Russell is nervous about Breckinridge at Hanover Court-House.

Respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,Bethel Church, May 27, 1864-7.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Received your dispatch by Captain Mason; also one of 6 p.m. Expecting to make a long march to-night, and the men being wearied, and on account of the difficulty of getting water, I had halted my command, say three-quarters of an hour ago, to let them make a little coffee. I shall now move on about 5 miles or to suitable camp. I think they will be able to do that now after their rest well enough.

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

Your obedient servant,
