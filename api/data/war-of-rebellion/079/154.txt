DECATUR, October 8, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

In answer to your telegram just received I can give you the following: I have ordered officers along the line of road to telegraph you immediately the information asked for from their commands. Post of Decatur - Battery F, First Ohio Artillery, 92; Battery D, Second Illinois Artillery, 37; Battery A, First Tennessee Artillery, 115; total artillery, 244. Infantry, Eighteenth Michigan Infantry, 330; One hundred and second Ohio Infantry, 290; Tenth Indiana Cavalry, as infantry, 274; total infantry, 894. Post Athens - Seventy-THIRD Indiana Infantry, 200; Tenth Indiana, 100. This supposes all the men at that post for duty. The remainder of Seventy-THIRD Indiana at block-houses and trains, 150. Second Tennessee Cavalry, about 320 for duty (200 with General Morgan, remainder at this post). Horses here are in miserable condition. In reports sent to you I have not included the force from Pulaski to Nashville, as it was under the immediate control of General Rousseau. No reports of them have reached me since the commencement of this raid. I before mentioned to the general commanding that the works here are very extensive, requiring a heavy garrison. The outer line of works, exclusive of the river front, is a line over 1,600 yards long. The present garrison cannot, therefore, man one-half of the works. They were laid out for General Stevenson's DIVISION. I have remedied this as far as possible by making the two redoubtes nearly independent of the rest of the works.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
