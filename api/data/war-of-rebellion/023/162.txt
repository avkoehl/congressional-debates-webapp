you will there either intrench or build a stockade to inclose your command. To resist cavalry or infantry the stockade is preferable. Posts from 6 to 10 inches thick, 2 1/2 feet in the ground and 8 or 9 above, are suitable, with loop-holes every 3 feet. The work can be done in a day, and you will lose no time about it. You will keep your command within or near the work.

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE OHIO,Tuscumbia, Ala., July 16, 1862.

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville:

The road has been in running order for two days. General McPherson will organize a daily train from Decatur to Corinth immediately. I have stated to him your request to forward provisions to Decatur for your command.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 16, 1862.

General THOMAS, Tuscumbia:

When you move you will cross mainly at Florence; your train at Eastport, as I suggested. Make your arrangements accordingly.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 16, 1862.

General CRITTENDEN, Battle Creek:

Your quartermaster telegraphs again to-day for clothing. Your want of clothing has been frequently reported and is not forgotten; it results, however, from the neglect of your own officers. You are aware; however, that the troops are on half rations, and even this supply is not altogether certain. Just as soon as provisions can be supplied in sufficient quantities clothing will be furnished you.

JAMES B. FRY,

Chief of Staff.

BATTLE CREEK, July 16, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL:

I have agents out seeking the information form all points named by you except McMinnville; hope to get something reliable to-day; will send out others as soon as I can procure suitable men and inform you at once. It was reported to me last night that a rebel force was at Altamont, but the reporter said he could not rely upon his information.

T. L. CRITTENDEN.
