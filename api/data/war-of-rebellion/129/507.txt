CIRCULAR CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA,
 WAR DEPARTMENT, BUREAU OF CONSCRIPTION, No. 23. Richmond, Va., June 24, 1864.

All white men from the State of Maryland between the ages of seventeen and fifty years, who are now "residents of the Confederate States," are, by virtue of the act of Congress "to organize forces to serve during the war," in the military service of the Confederate States for the war.

Commandants of conscripts will proceed to the immediate enrollment and examination of these persons in conformity with the provisions of Circular No. 8, Bureau of Conscription, current series.

Those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, determined by the Board of Examination to be capable of performing active service in the field, will be forwarded to Camp Lee, near Richmond, for assignment to the Maryland Line, but those between the said ages found unfit for field duty, but capable of performing some of the duties named in the eighth section of the aforesaid act of Congress, will be assigned to those duties by the commandants of conscripts of the State in which they respectively reside.

Those between the ages of seventeen and eighteen and forty-five and fifty years will be disposed of by assignment or detail by the commandants of conscripts of the States in which they respectively reside, under sections five and eight of the aforesaid act of Congress and under Circular No. 20, Bureau of Conscription, current series.

An active and vigorous execution of this order is required.

By order of Brigadier-General Preston, superintendent:

C. B. DUFFIELD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
