BULL'S GAP, April 23, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. W. BARRIGER,

Commissary of Subsistence, Knoxville:

It is very important that I should have here to-night 10,000 rations to enable me to carry out orders of General Schofield. Can they be sent up by extra train so as to reach here during the night? Please answer.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, April 23, 1864.

General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

We must make calculations, leaving A. J. Smith out. Banks cannot spare him, as I feared. Hurry up the two divisions from Cairo, and get ready as soon as possible, for I think Grant is pushing matters. I have news from Dalton to the 20th. A part of Polk's troops have arrived there. We must not allow our chief attention to be drawn toward Mississippi, as that is what the enemy wants.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, April 23, 1864.

General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

Colonel Comstock is here from General Grant, and we may have to move sooner than we are ready, but we can go as far as the Coosa. I will throw forward provisions enough to load your wagons, and they can be replenished at Ringgold.

If we move before Crocker gets up I will require you to move by Lebanon and Chattanooga, to communicate with Thomas at La Fayette and Villanow. But I will write at length. If we move by May 1, the divisions at Scottsborough, Larkin's, and Woodville should cross at Larkin's. Dodge's force and Garrard should cross at Decatur and move to Guntersville, and a junction made at Lebanon. I do not propose to cross the Coosa till all are up, but we will gain time by a move in concert with Grant.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. LEFT WING, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Athens, Ala., April 23, 1864.

Major General JAMES B. McPHERSON,

Commanding Dept. and Army of the Tennessee, Huntsville, Ala.:

GENERAL: Rumors over the river are very conflicting, but up to this time I am not satisfied that the force has been greatly increased. I think a small force of cavalry in addition has joined Roddey.

Two of the Ninth Illinois Infantry, who have been prisoners at Danville, escaped last night; they report a pretty large force, all mounted.
