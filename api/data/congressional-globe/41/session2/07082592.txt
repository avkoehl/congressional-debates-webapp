THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April IX,
and when boots and shoes come to be consid-
ered we will find protection demanded because
of the tariff on elastic cloth.-
I have made an estimate of the expense
thrown upon the consuming population of the
country so far as we have yet gone in this bill,
and we have .pnly as yet got fairly into the first
chapter of it. I find that a tax on every family
composed of aix persons is $134 15 per ^nnum.
The following is the table:
Annual tax by this bill upon a family of six persons-~two adults and four children-

Any gentleman who will examine t.liis table
will see that upon the articles of tea, sugar,
spieos, unbleached cotton, bleached cotton,
woolen, and the woolen goods now under con-
sideration, and the other articles which we
have so far gone over, the lax to each family
will amount to the enormous sum, as I have
said, of $134 16, and you still leave the family
without a hat, without a coat, without pants,
without boots or shoes, and without bread. I
agree with the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Mux-
onx] that no family supported by the labor of
one individual can be clothed and fed under
this enormous duty; yet it is claimed that
it is in the interest of labor that this tariff i3
imposed.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Jilr. IvEJjLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thought
that general debate had closed. But the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. Mayiiam] has
been discussing the duties on spices, tea, oof-
fee, &e. When we proposed to reduce the duty
on coffee the Democratic side of the House op-
posed the reduction ; and when we get to spices
I have no doubt they will oppose the reduction
on that article also, for we propose to reduce
largely the duty on spices. The gentleman
has said that the duties are not in the interests
of labor. I have shown what they are, 68 to
00 per cent. But is that on the manufacturer?
No, sir; it is on the wool. It is a duty for
Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota, western Ohio, and
all the rest of the wool-growing States. If
the gentleman will turn to page 271, No. 29 of
the Treasury Reports, he will find that the
duties on wool are very much higher ad valorem
than the duty on woolen goods; that they range
from 41 per cent, on one kind to G4J per cent,
on another, 01 per cent, on another, and 121
per cent, on another; so that while the wool-
growers of the West are claiming an average
protection of nearly 100 per cent, on their
wool, and are getting it, they refuse to give a
similar ad valorem protection to the manufac-
turer. The proposition is precisely that. The
specific duty on woolen goods i3 a counterpart
precisely of the duty on wool and the duty on
dye-stuffs. It is calculated to a nice percent-
age, and the only protection the manufacturer
has is the ad valorem duty which is added to
the specific. And this, as a blow at the wool-
grower and the laborer of the country, the
gentleman from New York would strike out.
1 ask what is the use of making tea and coffee
cheap to men who can find no employment and
have not a dollar to spend? Close your facto-
ries and turn your laborers out; let them and
their children starve, and then where will you
get your duties on spiees and tea ? Alas and
alack! the working people will not get many
of them. And this 35 per cent, is the barrier
between the wool of the West and the shoddy
of the West Hiding of Yorkshire and other
districts in England. This 35 per cent, is the
barrier between the Belgian aud Prussian
wages, or from 34 cents to a franc a day and
the generous wages paid the American men
and women.
[Hero the hammer fell.]
Mr. SCHENCK. The whole enormity of
this section is that we have departed so far
from the present law as to take off just one
third of the duty on gray goods. That is the
whole of it. But as gentlemen cannot talk on
that matter without running into general de-
bate on free trade and protection, I ask the
committee to close debate on this paragraph.
If I cannot got unanimous consent to close
debate on it I will have to movo that the com-
mittee rise for that purpose.
Mr. WOOD. My colleague [Mr. Gbiswold]
desires to say a. few words, and I hope the gen-
tleman will allow him to proceed.
Mr. SCHENCK. Gentlemen will not talk
about this paragraph.
Mr. WOOD. There has been more humbug
on the other side of the House than on this.
Mr, SCHENCK. Oh, no. I will yield,
however, for a few minutes that the gentleman
from New York may be heard.
Mr. COX. I will withdraw the amendment
to enable the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Griswold] to renew it.
Mr. GRISWOLD. I renew it. It is not
true, as stated by the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. Kelley,] that the Democrats
in this House voted to raise or to keep up the
duties on tea and coffee. A large majority of
the Democrats here voted to reduce the duties
on tea and coffee.
Now, in reference to this amendment, I think
it will be understood upon looking at the votes
here that in every case where these extraor-
dinary and enormous duties have been placed
upon any particular articles there is some pow-
erful organization to back it up, some,large
pecuniary interest. The people of the country
do not ask these extraordinary duties, the inter-
ests of the revenue do not demand it. It is
these powerful interests that are at work liere
and having their effect upon this committee
and upon the House.
Ithas beensaid that the duty upon wool is for
theprotectionofthefarmersoftheWest. Now,
it will be noticed that this is the highest duty
placed upon any article that is the. product of
the farmers, and to explain that it may not be
generally known that there is one of the most
powerfulorganizationinthecountry—theWool-
G rowers' Association—interested in raisingthe
tariff on this particular article of the farmers'
produce.
We heard the other day from the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mi-.Covode] that there was
a meeting between the woolen manufacturers
and the wool-growers, and that those t-wo organ-
izations united together in order to raise the
duty first upon wool and then upon the manu-
factured article, and thus by their coalition to
put a high tariff upon each and rob the peo-
ple of the country generally who are not here
with their lobby or upon this floor to take care
of their interests in the manner of those who
are especially interested.
I believe it will be 'found, as 1 said before,
that in the case of all these extraordinary duties
there is some powerful interest behind backing
them tip and urging their adoption. The coal
aud iron men of Pennsylvania and the cloth
manufacturers of the New England States come
together aud combine with the wool-growers
and some small interests in New Jersey and
elsewhere, aud thus the tariff is kept up in the
interest of those organizations and in entire
disregard of the rights of the people. I believe
that if the people of this country could vote
directly on these questions, or could be fairly
represented in Congress when here, the duties
upon theso articles of necessary use and con-
sumption by the poor and laboring classes of
the country would be far below what they are
at the present time.
The question was taken on the amendment,
and it was rejected.
The Clerk then read the next paragraph of
the bill, as follows :
On clothing and wearing apparel of every descrip-
tion, and on ISalmoral and other skirts and skirting,
composed wholly or in partof wool,worsted, ttaehair
of goats or other animals, manufactured wholly or in
part by tho tailor, seamstress, or manufacturer, ex-
cept knit goods, 50 cents per pound, and, in addition
thereto, 40 per cent, ad valorem.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move to insert afterthe
word " animals," inline two hundred and two,
tho words " silk not being a component mate-
rial thereof of chief value." That is the same
amendment I offered to the other paragraphs.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr.BROOKS, ofNewYork. In the woolen
compact of 18G7 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman must
propose some amendment in order to be enti-
tled to speak.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I move to
insert the word " like " before the word "ani-
mals." Or, in other words, I propose to restore
the law of 18G7. This word "like " has been
most adroitly left out of this bill, which is full
of meaning. Still, if a man does not study the
subject of dry goods and woolen goods day and
night, he cannot keep up with the numerous
little things in this bill.
Now, the effect of striking out this word
"like" is to raise the duty ou cloth, in which
hair enters as an element from 35 to 190 per
cent, ad valorem-, or, in other words, it -is not
tor the purpose of raising a revenue from mixed
goods into which hair enters, but it is to make
a really prohibitory duty, and that solely for
