DEVALL'S BLUFF, June 20, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Special train arrived at 5.30 a. m. Cavalry scout ordered toward Des Arc and Hickory Plains. If there is any considerable force on this side of White River, which I think is very improbable, they will attempt a dash on remount camp. It will be necessary for me to cover that place with my cavalry from here.

Respectfully,

J. K. MIZNER,

Colonel, Commanding.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, June 20, 1864.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR:

I have ordered out the entire available mounted force at this place, which will be small, as the Eleventh Missouri report but 316 serviceable horses in all. I will mount a small vedette on the provost horses. I had sent 130 men this a. m.

J. K. MIZNER,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
