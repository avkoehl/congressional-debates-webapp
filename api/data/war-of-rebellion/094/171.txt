Major-General DODGE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

If have any further re-enforcements to send to this place, I would like you to send three regiments of infantry or cavalry, if you can spare them, to Paducah, to report to General Meredith for special duty of driving the enemy from Danville bridge, on the Tennessee River.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 12, 1864-8 p. m.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Reconnaissance to-day showed enemy's force all around; in greatest strength on right, where some artillery opened. Thaw has begun, and to-morrow we can move without skates. Rebel General Lyon crossed the Cumberland twenty miles below Clarksville, Sunday, by capturing a transport; so we may los use of Louisville railroad soon, and communication by telegraph, but he cannot stay long-not strong enough. Trains run from Murfreesborough to Chattanooga. All quiet in that quarter and in East Tennessee.
