the first who alighted on the rock of Plymouth And am I, the
repiesentave of the descendants of these men—of the free peo
pie of the State of Massachusetts, that bears not a slave upon
it—amito come here and be tried for high treason because I
presented a petition—o petition^-io this House, and because
the fancy or imagination, of the gentleman from Kentucky sup
poses that there was anti slavery or the abolition of slavery in
it** The gentleman charges me with subornation of perjury
and of high treason, and he calls upon this House, as a matter
of mercy and grace, not to expel me fot these crimes, but to
mflictupon me the seveiest censures they can, and to decide
upon that, there are one hundred members of this House who
are slaveholders is any one of them impartial? No I
uust they will not consider themselves as impartial men, 1 trust
that many of them will have those qualms of conscience which
thegentlemanfiom Accbmac[Mr Wise] assigns as his reason
for being excused, and that they will not vote upon a question
on. which their personal, pecuniary, and most sordid interests
are at stake
Mr WISE I never avowed any such reason The rea-on
is, the personal loathing, dread, and contempt, I feel for the
man
Mr CALHOUN of Massachusettsrose toorder Thegentle-
man from Virginia £.Mr WiseJ had proceeded in his remarks
without lntetiuption, and Mr C insisted that the same right
should be secured 10 the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr,
Adams 3
[some woids passed between Mr Wise and Mr Calhoun,
of which nothing, bejond the accompanying gesticulations on
the part of the tormer gentleman, is known to the Reporter ]
Mi ADAMS proceeded I object, theieforc to the resolution,,
tn toto, as not only lnjunous t> my rights, to the rights of my
constituents, and injurious to the lights of ¿11 the free peopleof
the United States, but because thu&e who ¿ue to decide upon it
are, so far as they aie slaveholder^ challengeable if ihey were
jurors They are not the judges by whom I ought to be judged,
and they ought, eveiy one ol them, to exclude himself—eirber
from that motive, oi, if they please, the motive which the gen
tleman from Accomac assigns
Mr Speaker, I will not multiply words T simply say that,
as T cannot be tried by this Ilou&e foi the crimes alleged as
the motives foi the tiial, sol piotest against am decision of
this House I cali upon the House to dismiss the resolution
of the gentleman from Kentucky, as one upon which they
have no power whatcvei to act But, as I cannot pre\*nt
the action of the members of the Houe>e, whon I consider
partial, and theiefoie disqualified fiom pionouncing on my
GfKnces, I am still in the powei of the majority If they say
they will try me, they must try me If they «ay they will pun
ish me, they must punish mi If they say that, in grace and
metcy, they will spare me expulsion, I disdain ami cast then
mercy av,aj, and I ask them if they will come to such t tiial
and expel me 1 defy them I have constituents to ¿o to tint
will have something to say if tms House expels me Nor will
u be long befoie gentlemen will see me again
It appeal ? to mito beso clear that theie is no right in this
House to tr> and punish me, oi to show me that mercy or giace
which 1 disdain to i eceive at their hands, that aigumeut i* tm
n c^ssary But if they say «o, I shall then reqem thp applied,
tun of the benefits which the Constant on secures to peisons
in d fur these crimes injudicial tourts I shall then claim to
bj beard in my defence fully—without interruption—without
■hMiig set down again, as I was on a late- occasion, after the
Hou-^e hadpiomised to heai me, piensely at the moment when
1 wai coming to the mo-stpo nted p oof of the cast, I su*, amed
Ihjtpeit will not he so I hope that if I am to be 'lied for
dimes and to have the tender of the contemptible metcy of
the House I hope, I say, that a will be done in form, that a
iltywill be assigi ed when I shall have the oppoitun. ty of de
f i ding myself, when I shall havt the oppoitumty or collecting
1 'tw of those documents of which the gentleman fiom Acco
mar has been making a file and bundle, that he might e^pecto
\a c hiis bdeupon me
Hue Mr Adams concluded
A conveisation followed between Mr ADAMS and the
SFCAKER in ícjati m to the forr  m which the question on the
point of order sho dJ he put to the House, when on the surges
t m ot the Speaker, Mr A consented'hat it should be put in
th form of ioru>idei alion, to wit ' Will the House consider the
re olutioisl'
[ Vnd this question the Speaker said was not debatable ]
Ml MARSHALL (who was indistinctly heard at the Ke
pr rt i's dok fiom the position he occupied) said he wished to
* ori ra very few lemarksinieply to the argument of the gen le
i iai from Massachusetts, [Mi Adams I 1 hei e were two ¡ omts
to be consuh red—one a matter of law, and the other a matter
of ftct The crpnUeman had ac umed, in the first place, that
t e lesolutionofilicd by him (Mr M ) as a substitute for that
of tne gentleman fiom Vngmia [Mi Gilmer] charged him
[Mr A ] with subornation of perjury and high treason and that
t'iecensuie of this n>us,e was invoked against him for these
tvo offences A veiy supeitibial examination of this, resolu
tion would satisfy eveiy centloman, he (Mi M ) thought that
the gentleman w is mi taken in the fat t He [Mr A ] was not
chaigedwuh suroirition of perjury or high tieasoi, and in
po ntof fact wvs not put on trial one ihei of these chdiges It
was clniged thn a pioposition
"To the Repie*entati\esof the people to dissolve the or
game laws fíame 1 by then con«tuuei tb, and to support wh eh
they are coirn landed by th ?e coi aitue its to he sworn before
they can enter upon the execution of the political powers
created by it and entitled to them is a high breach of pnvi
lege, acontemot ofteied to tins II mse, a dnt.ct proposition to
the Legislature, and each m^mbu of it, to commit peijury,
and involving necessarily in us execution and its consequences
the destruction of our country and the dime of high uea
son "
Now this petition was not drawn by the gentleman,and he
was not charged foi it
Mi  ADAMS    Why am I to be punched for it1*
Mr MARSHALL Because, as a membei of this House,
tb e gentleman had permitted himself to be used as a vehicle by
which a petition involving within itself the proposition here set
forth was offered to the Representative body of the nation, and
the charge against the gentleman of offence against the pnvi
legesof this body, for which he (Mr M) had ventured to ar-
raign him, was net that he [Mr A] had petitioned for this ob
ject, or sanctioned the prayer of the petition, because the jour
nal showed thathe had at the same time moved instructions
against the prayer of the petition The gist of the charge was,
that the petition wasoffered, notthat it was high treason itself,
but that it would involve in its execution, if earned into eff ct,
the consequences of high treason. That was the chaige—that
the gentleman had made himself the vehicle by which a propo
Bition so base was to be laid before this honorable body Thw
was a fair statement of the fact    The resolve------
Mr ADAMte    What is the word "therefore?"   .
Mr MARSHAL! again read from the resolution
"Unsolved tkerpfo7e^ That the Hon Tohn Q.uincv Adams,
a member from Massachusetts, in presenting for the considera-
tion of the House of Representatives of the United Statesape
tiuon praying for the dissolution of the Union, has offered the
deepest indignity to the House of which he is a member, an m
suit to the people of the United States, of which that House Is
the leg.slative organ, and will, if this outrage be permitted to
pass unrebuked and unpunished, have disgraced his country
through their Representatives, in the eyes of the whole woild "
That was the charge, (continued Mr M) So far then for the
fact The gentleman had charged him with charging him
[Mr A ] with high treasi n    Theie was ao such charge theie
Mr ADAMS    It is involved in the resolution
Mr MARSHALL Cod knows in what cume the gentleman
may mvolvf himselfbef re begets thtouch this ma'ter He
[Mr A ] was only charged with making himself the vehicle for
the presentation of tin*, and therefore with bung liable to the
contempt of this House But even if it wa", and the gentleman
was eharged with it Suppose the gentleman had offered a pe
titionof his own to the House of Representatives to dissolve
this Union and had really made himself guilty of the same of
fence thatihe petitioners were guilty of, dil it follow tiiatm a
question of privilege befoie this Hou=c they would he entitled
to inflict on him the punishment the law had established for
this cume if he was found guilty oí high treason'' Wa  the in
qinry made for the pui pose of visiting him with punishment
undei the i ules of this House, or with ttvmg him for the put
pose of inflicting the penalty of the law**
If a membei of this House should m the Rotundo murder
one of his iellow members, because mmdei is tued by the law
of the land, could not this House so far as its laws exfended,
expel orcen ure the membei under then ink "> If theai~u
ment of the genllermn was coircct, the suiest wav rf esc if in<*
censuie oi pum hment beloiethis Hou^e was to becuilty of
some crime wouhy of death Hcdemtd the mitter o flaw If
a member of this Hou«e boicarm&agair «ttho United States, he
was guihy of high treason, and if the fact were [.nown to this
Home, did it follow a  a mattei of law, becau e the courts of
the United States wou d pini&h h m thai (¡eiefore th s House
could notcmsure or expU him'! He thought not The House
had the right to inquire into the ma ter and to inflict puni&h
ment according toth" law of Parliament, of wh ch they weie
the ludgeb, and sole judges
Then ifhehadnot read his law utteily in \aisi there was,
first, nothing m the article to which the gentleman had refei
red which would protect hmt even ll the charge weie made,
Horn the punishment ofthis House and second he would find
that there was neither in the preamble nor resolutions a charge
ofthis kind The preamble was simply a statement of the pe
tition itself, f*nd a declaration hat it did invite the House tn
perjury And did it nof* Where for ooth did the gentleman
fiom Massachusetts learn his law'* Not from his father he
was sure I hese were doctrines thatnotonly his (Mr M's )
uncle but the eentleimn s father, nevei taught A petition to
(he Corgiess of the United States to dissolve the Union, and
they swoin to support it' A repeal of the organic law of the
land' If ¡oho Marshall oi the Eldet Adims evei thought
the Constitution of the land could be lepealed by an act of
Congress, he had never found it in then writing if so his
íespect for both the gentlemen would be most essentially les
sened
He would go in'o more ofthis lenaler Ho b-d usen
merely to the point of oi 'ei male !>iht- Hous , and to the
question whethei the IIou ehada right to enteitaui suchaie

they could it seemed weie not, «nflicunt fiom their own

noth ne Ih wis led overv member of this Ilouee would lead

Mr riLLMORE said he  hd not íne fir tí c purpose of mak
inff a speech on this matter hut toappeil to th" Hiuse,andto
ask the sober part of this Hou^e whethei th's matter Bad not
gone far enough?
The SPEAKER said the \ei> question now for 'he Hou-e
to determine was whethe  it had gose far enough
Mr FILLMORE said he would then submit a motion to bring
it to a close
The SPEAKER eaict the question now was, whether the
House would consider the resolutions of tl5e gentleman from
Kentucky, [Mr   Marshall ]
Mr FILLMORE said  he had desired to make a few re-
marks, but would content himself by moving to tay it on th*
table
The SPEAKER asked what part the gentleman moved to lay
on the table
Mr FILLMORE said he moved to lay the whole subject on
the table
Mr GILMER'asked if it was not too late now to raise the ques«
tion of consideration?
