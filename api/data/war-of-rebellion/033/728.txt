as commissioner to raise the Eleventh Regiment Colored Troops. He asked my aid in that capacity. Desirous to facilitate the service, and with respect to his rank, I have assigned him an office and such assistance as his duty requires. By General Blunt's train we received 100,000 rations, without flour and little hard bread. By the coming train we will have as much more, with 20,000 rations of hard bread. The supply by each train is badly wanted.

Brigadier-General SANBORN, Springfield, Mo.:

General McNeil telegraphs that the enemy, in force, are apparently approaching Fort Smith. McNeil needs re-enforcements, especially artillery. If you can possibly spare any troops, move them in that direction, with orders to communicate with General McNeil, and to join him if he requires them. He also needs ammunition for small-arms See if you can supply him from Springfield.

You will communicate by the bearer where you are and what information you have, and when and by what route I may expect you into Springfield. Nothing of importance here.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,
