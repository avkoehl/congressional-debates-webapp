General GETTY:

There are now in Suffolk from 30 to 50 infantry, and a much larger force on the South Quay road just below town, removing the obstructions placed there by Major Wetherill. I anticipate an attack here to-night. Is there a gunboat on the river?

Captain L. G. ESTES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to inform you that I have been inspecting my picket line on the river this morning, and have observed that the enemy's pickets are not as numerous as they were yesterday, and their infantry posts have been relieved by cavalrymen; that they show less animosity at the presence of our pickets, and I am inclined to believe that they have withdrawn their main force from the river. A sergeant of one of the patrols reports that considerable noise was heard on the other side of the river at about 11 o'clock last night, and near Morton's Ford the officer commanding the pickets heard the beating of drums and the sound of the bugles at 3 o'clock this morning also the noise of wheels and shouting of men, as on a march.

I remain, captain, very respectfully,

H. E. DAVIES, JR.,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
