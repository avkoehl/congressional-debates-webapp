the construction of this great thoroughfare,
and her present magnilicentcontributions to (he
national resources will be many times multi-
plied. Instead of being on the borders of civili-
zation she will then be in the very center of that
continent which is destined to be the center of
the world's commerce. When the main trunk
line shall be completed private enterprise will
gridiron every part of that magnificent domain
with branch roads, as it has done in the older
States. Instead of one hundred and fifty mil-
lion acres of land, now valueless, being brought
within its influence, an area of five hundred
thousand square miles of fertile territory will
be transformed from the solitude in which it
has slept for centuries into the teeming fields
and prosperous homes of happy millions.
Consider also the value of the lands retained
by the Government. Within the said fifty
miles limits the Government would own over
a hundred million acres. Estimating only
one half to be good, we have fifty millions
of acres, now worth nothing, that would be
made at once, by the construction of the road,
worth from $1 25 to $10 per acre, making an
aggregate addition from this source alone of
at. least $100,000,000. The fact that the Gov-
ernment donates her lands to actual settlers
docs not affect this estimate, for the reason
that such donation is made because the con-
sideration of settlement and cultivation is
clearly more profitable to the Government
than the money price the land would bring.
4. It will augment our imports and exports,
and thereby increase the public revenue.
On this point I ask the attention of the
House to a few facts and figures taken from a
paper read before the Statistical Society of
Loudon, in November, 186(5, by II. Dudley
Baxter, lie assumes it as an ''axiom that
the commerce of a country increases in exact
proportion to the improvement of its railway
system, and that railway development is> one
of the most powerful and evident causes of the
increase of commerce."
The followingstaiisucs are adduced, together
with other important facts, in proof of that
pi oposition. Anyone who will give this paper
a careful reading will, I think, bo convinced
that there is much truth in his theory:

been for some time stationary before that pe-

perfection of her canals, which were the finest
and must numerous in the world : in the !ar<;e
tonnage of her shipping; in her access by the
Rhine to the heart of Germany; and in the
command of the German trade, which was
broi-ght to her ships at Amsterdam and Rot-
terdam. The Dutch reiied oil these advan-
tages and neglected railways. The Belgian
Government adopted a wise and extensive sys-
tem of railway improvements. Observe the
results. In 1839 the Dutch exports and im-
ports were £'28,500,000, nearly double those of
Belgium. In 18G2 they were ,€50,000,000, when
those of Belgium were £78,000,000. Thus,
while Holland had doubled her commerce Bel-
gium had increased fivefold. The former pos-
sessed a territory thirteen thousand eight hun-
dred and ninety square miles in extent; the
latter eleven thousand three hundred and thir-
teen miles. Their populations were not far
from equal.
Various other statistics are given, proving
conclusively that in all commercial nations a
distinct correspondence exists between ihe
means of internal communication and foreign
commerce; but I will content myself by re-
ferring to those of our own country.

the relative increase of foreign commerce to
railways may be found in Belgium.

period that may be selected, and similar results i

These statistics certainly show a very remark-
able correspondence between the increase of ,
railways and the increase of imports and ex-
ports, and nowhere is it more apparent than in
the United States. This increase will doubt- ;
less be much greater per mile when we shall ■
' have completed the proposed Pacific roads, for !
the reason thatthey will develop an immensely ,
; rich mineral region, and be the great highways !
j for the commerce of the world. The foreign \
\ commerce of a tuition depends mainly upon j
; the value of the products of its soil, its work-
! bhops, and its mines, and upon the facilities it :
i affords for the internal interchange of those j
' products for the commodities of other conn- j
! tries. Hence, considering the vast extent of J
! the United States, the millions of square miles i
wholly undeveloped, the sparseness of the pop- ;
i ulation. and the difficulty in exchanging com- |
i modities between distant points, we may (
I reasonably expect to find that the relation !
^ between the increase of imports and exports ;
1 and railway development will be more striking i
: in this country than in any other. Since 1830 '
! every additional mile of road has been followed ;
bvan additional twenty to twenty-five thousand
dollars of foreign commerce. ^ May we not,
therefore, safeiv assume that the construction 1
of the Northern Pacific, with all the advantages ■
and probable results I have enumerated, will
add to ourimports and exports at leas! £'20,000 ,
per mile, or an aggregate of $40,000,000 per ,
annum? As imports are geneially aboat equal j
to exports, we shall have from this cause aa i
additional $20,000,000 of imports, on which a
tariff equal to the present will yield an annual
revenue of over eight million dollars.
TEK NORTHE11X PACIFIC ROAD ISA COMMERCIAL
NECESSITY.
"First, because one road will not be adequate
to the business of the country; and second,
because no other route will so certainly con-
trol the commerce of Europe and Asia. 1 have
conversed with some gentlemen on this subject
who seem to fear that there will not be room
and business for more than one road. Let us
briefly examine this objection. It is only fif-
teen years since, by the opening of the Cleve-
land and Toledo railway, a continuous line was
formed between Chicago and the eastern sea-
board. Now there are no less than five double-
track roads connecting that city with New York
and Boston, and all of them are overwhelmed
with business. The increase of the tonnage of
these great, through Hues furnishes one of the
most remarkable illustrations of the wonderful
material progress of the United States, as well
as a conclusive answer to the objection under
consideration. The following table, copied
from the Manual, will .show the increase of ton-
nage on three of those lines for ten yeais:
1857. 1S67. Increase.
Iloads. Tons. Tons, percentage.

Some half dozen or more roads connecting
with these great lines are pushing forward iid
rapidly as possible to form a connection with
the Omaha and San Francisco road, which, it
is supposed, is to do the business not only of
the Pacific slope, but also of Rnropc and Asia.
Now, sir, in view of the fact that fifteen years
ago there was no railroad connection between
Chicago and the East, and in view of the im-
mense increase of internal commerce that now
crowds all the five great thoroughfares between
those points, is it not absurd to suppose that
one road can accommodate the trade between
the people of the Atlantic and Pacific slopes,
and between the six hundred millions of Asia
and the two hundred millions of Europe ? The
fact is, that the commorce of our own country
will, m less than ten years, crowd with busi-
ness two more JPaeiiic roads. There is ample
room for three. Mr. Baxter, from who&e paper
I have quoted, derncmstiutes that in Great
Biitaiu railroads will pay that have three and
a half milo <>(' countiy on each side to sup-
poit them. The question we debate is, whether
a teiritoiy iifieen hundred miles in widih will
not be r-ro wiled if we build three roads across i>.
But it is in repaid to its relations to loreigu
commerce that the advantages of this road ait*
most conspicuous. The most intelligent ?tateh-
men of Europe concede that the day is not far
distant when the trade between that continent
and A^in will bo carried on across this country.
In I8u-f a paper wa* road before the Ih'iush
North American Association by Colonel Synge,
of the queen's royal engineers, in which he
makes this statement:
"America h ^opcraphie'illy a 'Connecting link be-
tween the continents ot Europe and Asia, and n-;t
monstrous* b;u liui between them, it lies in tin' traek
ot the snul connection, and lliis tact
need*! only to be hilly recognized loiendct it in pi.v,-
tiee what it unqiU'Stnmaoiy is in the e^enu'ai point.-
ot (U&t.iiiLO aiid direction."
Says Lord Bury :
"Our trade (EodisbJ on the Pacific ocean with
China and wr.h ludin must ultimyteiy bo earned on
through our North American po^ecrdons. At any
rate oar political and comtneieial supremacy will
havo utterly departed from us if wc neglect thatjubt
and imi'ort:mt eomidf-ration, and ll we fail to cairy
out to us tallest extent the physical advantage* whien
our countiy oilers to sniu which we have only to
stretch out oui hand to take advantage ot."
English statesmen and capitalists are alive
to the, importance of tiiis Subject, and their
Government has already sent out. a corps of
engineers, which has made a careful survey
uf the whole country from Canada to the Pa-
cilic, and leported that a railroad through the
lUitn-h Xmih AnuoScan possesions i^ entirety
piactieabie. And iu fui t heranee Ol this scheme
