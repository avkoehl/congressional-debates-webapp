yards from our large battery near the Taylor house. As yet, but one or two guns have been opened on us. The position is well covered from our direct fire. I would recommend that four 10-inch or 8-inch, preferable 10-inch, mortars be placed in position near the Taylor house to control it.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 13, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

The withdrawal of Gregg's division of cavalry and Kautz's small force leaves but little cavalry to watch between the left of the army and the James. I would, therefore, suggest the withdrawal of the cattle herd of the armies in the field as near City Point as practicable. Kautz has been ordered to post a regiment at Sycamore Church.

Colonel SHARPE,

City Point:

Deserters from W. H. F. Lee's division of cavalry, Tenth Virginia Regiment, report the division doing duty in vicinity of Reams' Station. They say this is all the cavalry in that vicinity. They state that Hampton's division went away yesterday morning, supposed toward the Valley, and that Fitz. Lee's division left for the Valley shortly after the mine explosion. Deserters from Finegan's brigade report no change in position here.
