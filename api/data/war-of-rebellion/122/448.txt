Governor A. G. CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

Colonel Ballier, of Twenty-first Regiment, received an acceptance from the Department for a regiment to be made up from his three- months' men. I should prefer you to accept it as an additional regiment. You will oblige me by telegraphing that you will take it.

J. LESLEY, JR.,

Chief Clerk.

HARRISBURG, August 23, 1861.

J. LESLEY, Jr.:

Governor Curtin desires me to say that he is laboring to complete the requisition made upon him, and would feel embarrassed by undertaking to fill any of the independent regiments.

Governor SPRAGUE,

Providence, R. I.:

The Secretary thought the one regiment would come armed with Burnside rifles, hence why the query was made. I sent the message.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Providence, August 23, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: On the 18th of August I received the telegram about forwarding everything to Washington, organized or not. This I could not do. August 19 I received the following:

The Government desires to know immediately whether a requisition for the whole or a part of the uniformed militia or home guards of your State for temporary service would seriously embarrass the enrollment and organization of the volunteer forces now being enrolled for three years, or during the war. The exigencies of the public service may require the utmost promptitude on your part. Please answer by telegraph and state your views.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
