FORT FISHER, December 28, 1864 - 8 a. m.

General BRAGG,

Sugar Loaf and Wilmington:

Quiet during the night, except entrance of Will of the Wisp and Banshee, latter under a weak fire of two blockaders at very long range yesterday. The blockading vessels and small tugs - I count thirty in all - about six miles off. I am at a loss whether to put the obstructions on the Rips or not. Shall I do so? I send the Caswell troops to General Hebert. It will take a long time to get them on board. No light-draught steamer here. On arrival of the battalion of the Thirty-sixth please to make them march at once and send the Fortieth by steamer. Let me keep Graham until secure.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

FORT FISHER, December 28, 1864.

Flag-Officer PINCKNEY:

The Fry is beyond the reach of the Chickamauga. She is entire, four miles below the bar. It will not do to send her out. Please let Ward bring the Governor and myself up to town. Answer at once.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

FORT FISHER, December 28, 1864 - 7 p. m.

Flag-Officer PINCKNEY:

I will go over to Smithville in Chickamauga and bring Captain Fry and people up to city. Your dispatch was misunderstood.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

SUGAR LOAF, December 28, 1864.

General HOLMES:

General Bragg directs that Clingman's brigade be retained in Wilmington and the remainder of Colquitt's brigade be sent to Fort Anderson to join their brigade.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

FORT FISHER, December 28, 1864.

General HOKE,

Sugar Loaf:

Please send me another regiment, a good one, this morning. I have a great deal of work to do, and have to send 500 men back to General Hebert. It leaves me too weak entirely. I expect the battalion back from Charleston to-morrow.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
