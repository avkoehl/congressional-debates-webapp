I can add somewhat to the strength by employing the militia, but it will have to be done cautiously and at points where they can do no mischief. If any troops can be spared for these objects they should be directed to Pensacola. If they are sent from the north will you advise me as early as possible?

Provision will be made for Sherman's wants, if he should make his way to the coast.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

E. D. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST TENNESSEE,New Orleans, La., September 17, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Your dispatch of the 10th has just been received. The operations you suggest have been in contemplation and preparations are now in progress. I think I can give you the assurance that you will find friends in Mobile if the troubles in Arkansas should be soon ended. How far east of that will depend upon the re-enforcement that can be spared for this command.

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General J. KILPATRICK,

Commanding THIRD DIVISION Cavalry:

I am directed by the general commanding to give you the following information: G. W. Lee's battalion rebel cavalry is encamped at James Ressender's, or name similar to that, on Fayetteville road, about six miles from Campbellton; his scouts cross the Chattahoochee at Ben. Kemp's, about three miles below Campbellton. This force is very much overestimated, it is thought, at 1,200. Brown's battalion, of Rice's [?]
