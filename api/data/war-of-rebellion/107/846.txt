CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, September 18, 1862.

(Received 10 a. M.)

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

Instead of one baggage car with the ammunition as required in your disaptch of midnight, there were four cars which could not leave Washington until nearly 5 a. M. They arrived Camden Station 6.30 a. M., and we transferred them here through Howard Street to the Northern Central by 6.50 a. M. They left Bolton Station about 7 a. M. I have renewed my appeals to that company to urge them forward to Hagerstown and sent one of our men to accompany them through.

W. P. SMITH.

ARSENAL, September 18, 1862-1 a. M.

General RIPLEY:

Your dispatch just received. If I send men to the depot I can't possibly get on here. The laboring men live wide a Part and I can't collect them after night. My work to-night is very heavy. I can only send a few men in compliance with your order.

Lieutenant-Colonel.
