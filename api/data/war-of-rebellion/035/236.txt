HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., April 13, 1863.

Brigadier General GRENVILLE M. DODGE,

Commanding Corinth, Miss.:

I send you the following dispatch, received this day:

MURFREESBOROUGH, April 11, 1863.

My expedition leaves Nashville by river to-day. It will probably reach Hamburg six days hence. Dodge should move as soon as your orders can reach him. Should communicate with my force by messenger at Hamburg, so that each may know the whereabouts of the other. My force will probably land at Easport.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

You will move on Wednesday, as agreed.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, April 13, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

Henry's [?] force at Tuscumbia and Florence, 5,800. Over 5,000 of them are cavalry; eleven pieces of artillery-six at Tuscumbia and five at Florence. Dodge moves from Florence to Iuka to-morrow. Nothing hear yet of gunboats or Ellet's Marine Brigade. Dodge takes 5,000 men. If you come up, affairs will be settled.

HURLBUT.

FRANKLIN, April 13, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

The railroad between Columbia and Decatur is not used, though I believe in repair. Have no information from the Tennessee. The enemy in this vicinity is stationary, so far as I know. Sent General Baird with flag of truce yesterday about exchanging our wounded at Columbia. General Gilbert went out to-day to receive Van Dorn's reply. The matter has been referred to Bragg. Baird and Gilbert, who met Cosby and Armstrong, report the rebels much dejected. Much reason to be; the bottom is about knocked out of the Southern Confederacy. When will Crook be here? I need him badly.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, April 13, 1863-8 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

My troops are on the way back, by the direct road. I have given them orders to retaliate for the attack on the train. I intend to burn down every house that has a rebel member in Dick McCann's force. Will be at Murfreesborough to-night.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
