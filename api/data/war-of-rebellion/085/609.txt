to Fort Scott. The train loaded with supplies at that post and started back the 12th day of September, and, on the 19th, was attacked at Cabin Creek by General Gano with 2,300 men and six pieces of artillery, and was captured together with 86 prisoners. The escort with the train consisted of about 400 men. A re-enforcement of seven companies from Gibson had joined the train before the attack. Anticipating that the enemy might attempt to take the train, as the Arkansas River was fordable at any point, and before I had information that the train had started from Fort Scott, I had sent Colonel Williams with the First Kansas Colored, Fifty-fourth U. S. Colored, and the Eleventh U. S. Colored Infantry, and one section of artillery to meet it. Though he made extraordinary marches he failed to reach it in time. The enemy, however, was obliged to burn about one-half of the train. Colonel Williams' men were so completely exhausted that he could not pursue. My last information from the main force of the enemy left him between Honey Springs and the Canadian. On hearing of the loss of the train, and being cut off from communications with you and not knowing how long it might continue so, nor the amount of supplies at Little Rock, and fearing your communication on White River might be interrupted by Price or Shelby, I thought it advisable to communicate direct with General Halleck, and sent him dispatches, of which the inclosed are copies.* He, however, seems to have anticipated me. On to-day a dispatch reached me from him, of which the inclosed is a copy.* My object in communicating with him was to get another train from Fort Scott with a sufficient escort, and thus provide for the future in case I could not get supplies escort, and thus provide for the future in case I could not get supplies from Little Rock. My first dispatch to Genera Halleck is dated the 22nd ultimo. his to me is dated the 24th, and must have been sent before mine reached him. I have subsistence for sixty days and can live longer in case of an emergency, though the supply of sugar will be exhausted the 20th of this month. I shall hold this place and gibson under all circumstances, and in the last extremity. Much additional work toward strengthening the fortifications has been done at both places within the last two weeks, so that they are now thoroughly fortified. I have now no train to send to Little Rock. Could not Colonel Carr send up a train of 200 wagons with subsistence, the train to be turned over to Captain Durbin? It could come up under escort of the Second Arkansas, though I think there should be an additional force accompany it toward Clarksville to be met by a force from here which I would send if I knew the train was coming. The river is now in good boating condition and any of your boats can come to this point without any difficulty. I know of no force on the south side of the river that could interfere with them, and the passing down of Major Derry's command on the north side will probably have the effect to drive back any force on that side. It is possible that the river may continue so that you can send up plenty of supplies by boats. I have hard that a force of about 3,000 was on its way from Texas to re-enforce Cooper. I have had reason to anticipate an attack since the capture of the train, but I am not certain now what the intentions of the enemy are. I have sent to Gibson for the Eleventh U. S. Colored Infantry and it will be sent to Little Rock, on their arrival here.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
