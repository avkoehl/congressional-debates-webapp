1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
4201
has made no ruling on that subject. Any
Senator can have any paper read that he calls
for.
Mr. PRATT. I shall have to object to the
consideration of that bill at this time until
the cases reported from the Committee on
Claims are all considered.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thought they
were.
Mr. PRATT. No, sir. I wish to call up
one or two cases reported from that com-
mittee.
The PRESIDING OFFICER.. Does the
Senator from New Jersey withdraw his bill?
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I do not if it
is in order.
'The PRESIDING OFFICER. This bill
has been taken up by a vote of the Senate. It
can belaid aside by unanimous consent.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. 1 object. I
think, as this bill is up now, we had better
dispose of it.
Mr. PRATT. This evening was specially
designated for the consideration of bills re-
ported from the Committee on Claims, and I
think they are entitled to be heard.
The, PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
was informed that the bills from that commit-
tee were disposed of.
Mr. PRATT. If the bill of the Senator
from New Jersey will not lead to debate, I
do not object.
Mr. CASSERLY. It will.
Mr. FIIEL1NGHUYSEN. It will lead to
some debate, but it ought to pass, and at any
rate I wa-pt to get a vote of the Senate upon it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
understood a Senator from the Committee on
Claims to say that their calendar was ex-
hausted, and he then recognized the Senator
from New Jersey, and his bill was taken up by
a vote of the Senate, and it is now before the
Senate.
Mr. COOPER. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I ask for the
yeas and nays.
Several Sexatoiis. Oh, no ; take a division
first.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I withdraw the
call.
The- question being put, there were—ayes
ten.
Mr. WILSON. I hope Senators will not
insist on a division. 1 should like to ask
unanimous consent to give me next Wednes-
day night.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is a further
count insisted upon ?
Mr. ROBERTSON. Yes, sir.
Twenty-seven Senators rose in the negative.
'The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate
refuses to adjourn, but there is not a quorum
voting.
Mr. CONKLING. Let us have the yeas and
nays. There is a quorum present.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The Secretary proceeded to call the roll.
Mr, WILSON. While the Clerk is looking
over the list I ask unanimous consent to give
me Wednesday night.
Mt. STEWART. Oh, no; we cannot do
that.
Mr. WILSON. I must have some night. I
have twenty-five or thirty bills, and if the Sen-
ate will give me an hour and a half I can dis-
pose of them.
Mr. RAMSEY. I will divide the night with
you.
' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is
out of order pending the announcement of the
vote on the motion to adjourn.
The result was then announced—yeas 9,
nays 29: as follows :
YEAS—Messrs. Bayard, Casserly, Cole, Cooper,
Kelly,' Saulsbury, Stcrenson, Stockton, and Viek-
^NAYS—Messrs. Alcorn, Blair, Boremap.Caldwell,

So the'Senate refused to adjourn.
Mr. WILSON. I ask unanimous consent
that Wednesday night be given to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, the Committee on
Post Offices and Post Roads, and the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I object for the
present until this bill is passed.
Mr. STEWART. I do not object to assign-
ing an evening, but I object to the time that is
made in so thin a Senate.
Mr. BAYARD. What is the bill before the
Senate? -
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be
read for information.
The Chief Clerk. The bill before the Sen-
ate is the bill (H. R, No. 694) to prevent
cruelty to apimals while in transit by railroad
or other means of transportation within the
United States.
Mr. PRATT. I move to lay that bill on the
table for the purpose of allowing the remaining
bills upon the Calendar reported by the Com-
mittee on Claims to bp considered.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I object to de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion
is not debatable. The question is, shall the
bill lie on the table?
Mr. PRATT. I ask for the yeas and nays.
I wish to see whether the agreement of the
Senate will be carried out.
The question being taken by yeas and nays,
resulted—yeas 23 nays, 14; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Alcorn, Bayard, Blair, Boreman,

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no
quorum voting.
Mr. SPENCER. I move that the absentees
be called; I am satisfied there is a quorum
here.
Mr. COLE. I move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
Mr. PRATT. Is it in order to make a single
remark ?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unani-
mous consent.
Mr. PRATT. This evening I understood
was given to the Committee on Claims to con-
sider all bills proceeding from that committee,
1 believe, with the exception of two. I ask
for the consideration of one.
Mr. COLE. We have considered too many
to-night from that committee, I am sure.
Mr. PRATT. 1 thought the whole evening
was given to that committee. There are only
$400 or $500 involved in the bill I wish to
have considered.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
must remind the Senate that the last vote dis-
closed the want of a quorum.
" Mr. WILSON. The question is on adjourn-
ment. I ask for the yeas and nays on that
motion. Let us see whether we have a quo-
rum or not.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. -On-the
motion made by the Senator from California,
that the Senate- do now adjourn, the Senator
from Massachusetts demands the :yeas and
nays.- :
The yeas and nays were ordered and taken,
with the following result:
YEAS—Messrs. Bayard. Blair, CaJeFwMT, Casserly,
Cole, Cooper, Cragin, Harlan, Hitchcock, John-
ston, Kelly, Lewis, Osborn, Pomeroy, Pool, Ramsey,
Saulsbury, Stevenson, Stockton, and Vickers—20.

Maine, Morrill of Vermont, Morton, Nye. Patter-
son, Rice, Sherman, Sp-rague, Sumner, Thurman.
Tipton, Trumbull, West, Windom, and Wright—36.
The call of the roll having been concluded,
Mr. WILSON. Before the announcement
of the vote is made, I ask unanimous consent
that Wednesday evening be assigned to- the
Committee on Military Affairs, the Committee
on Naval Affairs, the Committee on Agricul-
ture, and the Committee- on Post Offices and
Post Roads.
Mr. HITCHCOCK. I object.
Mr. HILL. I must ask my friend from Mas-
sachusetts, doss he expect to behere on Wed-
nesday evening? [Laughter.]
Mr. WILSON. 1 have twenty-five bills from
the Military Committee. I should like to have
Wednesday evening. I do not expect to pass
any bills that anybody opposes. When we
get through, others may have what they can
get.
The PRESIDING OFFICER.- Is there
objection to the proposition of the Senator
from Massachusetts?
Mr. HITCHCOCK. I object.
Mr. RAMSEY. With this amendment, that
he take in the Committee on Po^t Offices and
Post Roads, who have a parcel of small bills
winch will not be objected to.
The PRESIDING OFFICER'. Is there
objection to that proposition?
Mr. CONKLING. What is the proposi-
tion?
The PRESIDING OFFICER.^ The Chair
understands it to be the proposition of the
Senator from Massachusetts that Wednesday
evening be set apart to the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs, and the Senator from Minnesota
adds the Committee on Post Offices and Post
Roads.
Mr. CONKLING. I shall want a little-time
to consider that unless I know what sort
of bills the Post Office Committee intend to
take up.
Mr. RAMSEY. I assure the Senator that
the postal telegraph bill, which he stands so
much in dread of, will not be brought up.
Mr. CONKLING. I do not object, if the
Senator says that he wants ah evening to take
up routine measures from the Post Office
Committee.
Mr. RAMSEY. That is. all.
Mr. CASSERLY. I shall not object to that
proposition provided it is understood that no
other bills are taken up.
Mr. COLE. I am under the necessity of
objecting while the appropriation bills are in
their present condition.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator from California-object?
Mr. COLE. I can only consent on condi-
tion that it be subject to the unfinished bnsi-
Mr. CONKLING. One minnte before this is
announced. The suggestion made by the other
Senator from California, [Mr. Casserly,] I
am afraid, will have the effect, as usual, to
bring a very thin Senate here. Senators come
who are interested in the particular bills to be
considered: other Senators feel exonerated,
and we shall have a very small attendance. I
do not believe the Senator from California
farthest from me [Mr. Casseblt] wants that.
