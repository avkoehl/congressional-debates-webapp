Just arrived after a rough passage on steamer Monterey. Could not land at Cape Fear. Left Savannah 19th, Port Royal 22nd. Wet and stormy weather. General Sherman still at Savannah. Cotton being shipped at rate of 800 to 1,000 bales per day. Treasury and War Departments working smoothly and harmoniously.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: General Mower is still maneuvering against the Salkehatchie bridge and it is important the movement from Garden's Corners should be kept up. Continue it until you receive further orders. If boats can be obtained, let an effort be made to cross, but I do not wish it done at the risk of loss of life - merely to attract the enemy's attention.

Your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
