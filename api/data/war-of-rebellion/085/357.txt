that Brookhaven and Summit were the points as which Taylor's [men], in case they succeded in crossing, were to be supplied with stores. From Summit I went to Osyka and found that all the provisions had been moved to Summit. At Camp Moore I found Colonel Orgden with 210 men, who were to scout the country and stop cotton. At Bayou Barbary, in Livington Parish, I found two companies under Captain Doyal (about seventy-five or eighty men). They are there to stop cotton, but there is more smuggling done there than any other place. They (the Confederates) get powder, revolvers, carbines, caps, clothing, and provisions. Stopped two days there. I saw a man by name of Alcus get fifty carbines and 60,000 water-proof caps. At Osyka, in the printing office, I saw in a paper that all the militia of Alabama should be sent to Mobile, because an order was received from Richmond that no troops could be sent from there, and the State must protect itself. All negroes to be sent to Mobile to work on the fortifications. General Hodge is commanding, with headquarters at Liberty.
