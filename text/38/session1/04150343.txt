THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
simply to give validity to the existing act of Con-
gress. It does not undertake to go beyond that
existing act of Congress. Now, if we refer to that
act, we find these words:
"That hereafter every person elected or appointed to
any office of honor or profit under the Government of the
United States, either in the civil, military, or naval depart-
ments of the public service, excepting the Presidentof the
Uniied States, shall, belore entering upon the duties of
such office, and before being entitled to any of the salary
or other emoluments theieof, take and subscribe the follow-
ing oath or affirmation."
The statute is limited in its operation to those
" hereafter clected or appointed, "and the rule ob-
viously is confined to an enfoiccment of the exist-
ing statute.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will,
then, if there be no objection on the part of the
Senate, give to it that construction, that it applies
to such officers of the Senate as have been elected
or appointed subsequent to the passage of the law
prescribing the oath.

a model ready for exhibition in the city of Wash-

Washington City, January 20,1864.
Sir : I was taken wholly by surptise at the presentation
of the resolution to expel me from the Senate. I had not
expected, or even thought of any resolution which was
made the ground ot that proceeding, or any one, or the
whole of the caries producing any such movement. f
therefore avowed.in substance.'distmctly, that the mover
of the rebolution for my expulsion interpieted the resolu-
tion on which he based his erioneously and injuriously
to mc. That in offering those resolutions Iliad no puiposo
to invite the Army to mutmv, or the people to sedition, or
any violence whatever; but it was to exhort the whole
people. "North and South, to terminate the war by a consti-
tutional settlement of their difficulties and reconduction
of the Union; and that the seties of resolutions would not
fairly admit of any other construction; all of which I now
rcnlfnm.
I am prompted-to make this disavowal again. In this
form, to place it upon the records of the Senate, it having
as yet only appeared in the report of itrf debates. And
with this note, which I request you to lay before the com-
mittee. I submit the case on my part to its action.
Yours, &c., GARRETT DAVIS.

exhibited in the letter of the honorable member
from Kentucky just read from the Chair seems

predicament; and I desire now to say to the Sen-

hedesires leave to withdraw the resolutions which
