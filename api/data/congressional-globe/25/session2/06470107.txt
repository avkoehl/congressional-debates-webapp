Senate.
which now, like a dense cloud, hangs over the
land, has been the work of our hands. I have,
Mr. President, on a former occasion, answered lhi¡>
statement. It has been said that the Specie Circu-
lar was* the cause of the suspension of specie pay-
ments, and that it was the hostile action of the
Government which has produced the pressure
which now prevails.
This deposite system had its origin m 1833, and
from that time to June, 1836, a few selected bants
had the control of all the public deposites That
law was passed, and did it find those deposite banks
■which had received the public money, prepared to
pay over that money agreeable to the provisions of
the act of June, 1836? JVb, siv no Every dollar
had been loaned, and before the Manhattan Bank,
jn the city ef New STork, could comply with the
terms of that act; before it could make the transfer
of the public money to the new depositories, so as
to reduce the sum it held to a ¡sum equal only to
three-fourths of its capital stock, it was compelled
to make collections of its customers; and the histo«
ry of the times will show that, with the passage of
that act commenced the pressure of the deposite
bank5:.
This was the case with all the tunics which had been selected
a& public depositories ptevious to 183b The amouat of the
Government funds cor^Bted exclusively m the credits of the
banks This act of 1836 was then, the very first measure
which went to impose a check upon the operations of the de
posite banks in then extraordinary caieer The public money
wis collected by one «et of banks from their cu:>tu>iier*= and
transferred to anothei <*& of banks This opera^icm wt of ne
ee<?-ity, pecuhaily embarrassing to the old deporte bank* but,
the language oi the act vv a** periertly explicit It dec'ared to

I can assure the honorable Senator from \ irsin'a that it was
nn theaet of 1*336, nor was it the specie Circular which { ro
duced the pecuniary pressure which existed m the autumn of
ib3b and the commencement of 1837 There wab a pre existing
pause The evil was beyond the origin of that measure it
wis the great extension of individual credit, the most unexam
pied expansion ofa paper circulation, which existed antenorto
June, 1836, which furiiibhedan adequate cau<-e for all the pecu
r^ary evils which subsequently orrurred The Specie Circn
lar then, so far from having an injurious operation, must have
teWed to check the madness and extiavagauce of the bank

press with itsmHity power, ha  reiterated over and over again
the¿e charees against the late and present Administration of our
National Government The public mmd has been agitated
upon this subject from Maine to Florida Every argument
which the ingenuity of man could devise, has been put forth
to produce conviction that the evils which afflict our land are
the fruita of the weak and wicked measures of the Admims
trati on
At a late political rneeunfr m Rhode Hand, it was
" jResolvedi That this most deplorable condition of the cour
try is mainly attributable to the ignorance, the felly, ©r the wick
ednesbofom rulers "
The^e charge" have been promptly met—boldly and directsv
controverted—and the is ue has been made before the Arne
ncan people With them I am Tviiiine to leave this whole
matter Their deliberate <jiJ unprejudiced judgaaeiit must be
formed and w'libe promulgaredin a manner not tooenv-
und^r tood by their public servants and, *or one I en'ertam
no doubt what \m" be that padgment That there does ex.st
great derangement m the currency—that there does exi=t a
mo^t extiaordmary pre^uie among the various buf-inee*?
classes of our community—I shall not deny, the fart is ad
mitted, hut I differ—radically and essenually differ—with 'he
honorable Senator Irom Massachusetts, that these disasters to
business ana to currency have proceeded from the acts ofthe
Government
If the fault Iiee at the door of the Administration—if this
universal distresshas been produced by those in poiver-j-why
has not the particular measure ofthe Administration, charge-
able wrh all these evils, been designated? "Why do the hono-

try, because, as the Senator from Massachusetts most apfaro-
pnareiy remarked
"There had «own up a currency of p^r áeqeá l^r ba£&^,
seuing ont with the psomise to pay g ld aaásily*^ wttích tihey
had been wholly unable to redeem, ihe tfimeqamce was, ifcat
there was a maggof paper aSoat, which sustained no ijoiHe-
díate relation to the legal currency of the eoímüry."       "    ~
This was the stated the carreacy and of cfedi£—tíie condi-
tion of trade and of commerce then \ arid is not this a meet per-
fectj exact, and faithful representation of t&e presem. state of
the currency and of credit—of trade $ná of commerce? The
fact is undeniahJe The Senator himself aduirte it He made
the comparison, and lam free to acknowledge its justice ana ks
arcuracy What,thea, was the cau?e of the calamities—Om
pecuniary disiress-tbe commercial embarrassnserits—the bank'
ruptcy and ruin, which pervaded the country in 1816?
it proceeded from an extraordinary and unwarrantable ex-
pansion of credit, an over issue of bank paper, and its conse-
quent depreciation and debasement These were the causes,
and these were adequate causes, for the bankruptcies, botr!
to individuals and corporations, which followed. Like causes
will produce hkeeffects There is no occasion to indulge m
specjlauou on this subject The man who will look abroad,
cannot-a* cud the conc'usjon that the evils which row exist in
tke la«d aie the cei tarn eflec*s of an unwarrantable expansion of
ihe credu b> -fern To tins souice may be ascribed all the dis-
tress and embarrasgiT'eiit v hich now exist in the commercial,
a  well a^ 11 the other, clames oí the community
Tt is an un'oubtpd fart, that for a few years anterior to 1816
an immense amount of bank r-aper had been put in circulation
to carry on the war and to sustamthe credit of the Government;
and it is equally tine that thi% same amount of paper had been
disbursed to the creditors of live Government, and it was the de-
preciated value of tbi  paper, its irredeemable character, which
debased the currency of the country It was the total mabihty
ofthe bards to take up this paper which destroyed pwbfac con-
fidence, and producer tbe bankruptcy of theToisüitationa.
These were the true causes which produced the universal
distru«' and distress which prevaded the country is IS&ij ana
precisely the same causes naye operated to produce the saina
erTccts n 1837 The great extension -of individual credit, a. con
sequent < xpap**ion of the paper oitulatioo has brought upon
