was compelled to supply by impressment. At this place I received a communication from Colonel Ross, commanding cavalry escort, that the road for the next 12 miles was good, but after that for 12 miles on to Sunflower was muddy and boggy, but was practicable. I followed on after his train for something like 16 miles, when I found it impossible to proceed farther.

Colonel Ross then sent back 11 or 12 yoke of oxen for the purpose of assisting my train to this point, but all my efforts were in vain. The oxen could move the wagons out of the deepest holes, but the mules could not proceed with them, the mud being belly-deep to them. It commenced raining on the evening of the 30th, and continued all night and the next day, until 2 p. m., when it commenced snowing, succeeded by a hard freeze that night. My wagons are now about 7 miles east of this place, frozen in the mud, and it will be extremely difficult to extricate them from their present condition. I have abandoned the expedition, after consulting with Colonel Ross, and it is my intention to retrace my steps to east side of Big Black, asking of you information as to what disposition to make of the arms and a force sufficient to protect their safety to some point you may designate.

Respectfully submitted.
