General BURNSIDE:

My authority is Mr. West, who was warned to leave his home by Mr. Huff, who keeps the ferry, and who stated that the bridge was being laid down; also the statement of the pickets; also the statement of my assistant adjutant-general. None of them could see the bridge, but were close enough to hear the laying down of the planks. The pickets saw men crossing in boats also. No reason to doubt the statement. The enemy's pickets were within 50 yards of Captain Curtis. He heard officer command drivers of teams. He could go no nearer without being captured. I have a squad of cavalry as near as they can get to the enemy yet, and shall obtain the optical proof if possible.

Major-General.
