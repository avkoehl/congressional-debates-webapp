MONTEREY, May 13, 1862.

Flag-Officer FOOTE:

We have reliable information that nearly all the rebel troops have been withdrawn from Fort Pillow and Memphis, very small garrisons only being left at each place. Is it not possible to prepare the gunboats with cotton or hay bulwarks and run past the enemy's works to Memphis? He has a large fleet of river boats there, but no formidable gunboats. By doing this you would cut off the enemy's supplies from Arkansas and open a direct communication with the army of General Curtis.

Major-General.

HUNTSVILLE, May 13, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just received an order from General Buell to send all prisoners of my division captured and paroled by [John H.] Morgan to Louisville for duty under the provost-marshal. Before receiving this order I had opened negotiations with General Beauregard and E. K. Smith for an exchange. I trust in this I was not passing the limit of my duty, and hope I may be permitted to make the exchange. Have sold 270 bales of captured cotton, which is now going forward to market.
