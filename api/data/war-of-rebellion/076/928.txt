TWO MILES AND A HALF FROM FAYETTEVILLE,

July 29, 1864-10 p. m.

General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: The latest reports represent the enemy moving toward Fayetteville. I am quite certain they are moving back to cross the Chattahoochee. I have Harrison's brigade in their front at Fayetteville, and am moving now with Ross' brigade to that place. Should enemy attempt to pass round the place I will gain their front or flank about Newnan. If you can follow and push them in rear it would be well.

Very respectfully,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS HUMES' CAVALRY DIVISION,In the Field, July 29, 1864.

Major E. S. BURFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Mr. Bond, a soldier of the C. S. Army, under General Cobb, now on furlough, reports that about forty Yankees were seen this morning near Brushy Knob, about four miles from this place. They were going in the direction of Jonesborough. This fact he says was reported to him by reliable parties, but he did not see the Yankees himself. They took everything they could find from Mr. Martin, a citizen who lives near Brushy Knob, and left this morning.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. Y. C. HUMES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I have just sent a scout of 100 men, with orders to go four or five miles to reconnoiter.
