SIR: A rebel steamer, the Ida, ran by our battery on the Savannah River on the 14th instant for Fort Pulaski. The guns had not been worked nor the ranges obtained. On the next day she attempted to return, and four of Tatnall's gunboats came down from Savannah to cover her. They were all sent back to their places of departure, and one of them seriously crippled.

I inclose herewith the copy of General Viele's report on the subject.
