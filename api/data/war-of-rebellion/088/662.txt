burg, and that General Warren thought it might be a working party, &amp;c. Colonel Walker had this and several dispatches on his person when captured.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 2, 1864-11.45 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

I send you the dispatch* you probably referred to. I do not find any other of similar character.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 2, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

It is considered that the four guns in Battery Numbers 20 might be removed without materially weakening the line there, and they are therefore available for transfer to the line now held by Birney. The armament for Battery Numbers 6, near Fort McGilvery, is marked for two 30-pounder Parrotts, but the difficulty of supplying them with ammunition makes it desirable to substitute two field guns for the armament of the redoubts and batteries, as prescribed in the list.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1864.

Major DUANE:

Is there any name for the fort at the Strong house? One would be very convenient.

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1864.

General MILES,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires me to say that the order for immediate movement has been countermanded, and that the troops may be allowed to make themselves as comfortable as possible..

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. WILSON,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
