Commissioner for the Exchange of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 5th instant elating to two colored boys who accompanied the Forty-second Masssachusetts Volunteers from Boston, were captured during the expedition to the Sabine River in the spring of 1864, and subsequently sold into slavery at Houston, Tex. In by stipulations for exchange with the insurgents west of the Mississippi I have always made it a rule to require that persons of this character should be regarded as prisoners of war, and I know of no individual cases in which this has been complied with. As Texas is now within the limits of General Shheridan'ss command, I have referred your communication for his action.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
