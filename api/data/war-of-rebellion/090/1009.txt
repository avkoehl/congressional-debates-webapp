HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

Near Brucetown, August 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have but four regiments of cavalry and four pieces of artillery to defend the fords in your immediate front, and can keep but two regiments and two pieces of artillery on picket at a time, as I am obliged to graze the others. If it should be deemed advisable to hold these fords on the Opequon, I would suggest that the force be increased. I have been quite unwell since yesterday morning and am confined to my bed.

Respectfully,

FITZ LEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

Near Brucetown, August 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SORREL:

COLONEL: An infantry prisoner taken to-day reports that Sixth Corps marched through Charlestown, encamping near Cameron's Depot, on Smithfield pike, and moved up toward latter place yesterday afternoon, when their cavalry retired. A brigade from that corps (I mentioned before) actually reached Smithfield, following up our retiring infantry. The Nineteenth and Eighth Corps also passed through Charlestown, the first taking the Leetown and the other the Berryville roads, encamping, I presume, in the edges of the town, as they have not appeared anywhere on these roads.

FITZ LEE,

Major-General.

Major General FITZHUGH LEE:

I have men now at Smithfield, the enemy's vedettes being in sight on the hill beyond the town. I have ordered a picket-post to be established, if possible, on the hill beyond Smithfield. A brigade of the Sixth Corps came up to the town yesterday evening, but retired last night. The infantry is said to be encamped now at Baker's Run. My pickets are now at this end of the town.

Your obedient servant,

W. C. WICKHAM,

Brigadier-General.
