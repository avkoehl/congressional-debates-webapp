and inventions of art be more benefieraliy il-
lustrated than in the improvement oí the &eans
of national d*fence. Tnat the cause of hu-
manity will be piomoled in proport on as the
existing system <&nd means of defensive warfare
are perfected by new improvement", in affording
to all nations g'eater security to she independent
enjoyment of thei own acquisitions and fomis of
society and Gove nment, in puttirg the weak upon
a more equal f< oting wi h the strong, in renden g
wars less frequent, and allying all the arts oí
peace to flourish in uninterrupted vigir, canv,ot be
doubted. It is a source ef much grantic tion to
observe that several gentlemen ot high profes-
sional distinction in the rrmy are employing them-
selves in. fie^e appropriate studies. But while, 11
carrying forward the p an devised in former >ears,
due regard should be had to the improvements al
ready introduced in the means of defence, and, as
far as prac'icable, to =uch mo lifications as may be
rendered necessary by futir discoveries, wc must
take care, by the most efficient application of Use
means alleady known and approved, not to 1< se
the advantage of present security
The arr«y ot well authenticated facts and results
of past experience, and the well sustained reason-
ing foanded upon them, <>xmbited in the renort of
the board of officers referred to in the accompany-
ing letter ae the Chief of the Corps of Engineers,
appear to be conclusive m favor of completing the
system of defence therein recommended, so far, at
least, as to place the country in what ts denomi-
nated a food stafe of deiensive prepara'ion agimst
any sudden occurrence 01 wai. To this extent
the complefon of the works heretofore projected
may be regarded as indispensable, howrvtr defee-
tve they may be <ts a perfect system of national
defence. It will be teen ¡rom the esunates stated
in the report alluded to, that to e ieet ihat object
will require an appropriation oí $lj,69 J 547 upon
the fortifications, arid $2 433,01)0 tor the arma-
ment-, making together the sjm of $12 186,547.
The obligation of the Government to apply this
sum to the objects conterrplated as sp°edily as the
nature and due permanence of the several con-
structions will admit is rendered imperative and
absolute by every consideration of public safely
and public honor.
It is cumaied by trie Chief Engneer that the
sum of |1,4"Í5,500 can be judiciously and most .
beneficially applied upon these essential works of
defence during the remainder of the present yeai,
in addition to the appropriations heretofore made
for the sime objects. The expenditure* in this
branch of the seivice have been more considerab e
in the current quarter than usual, and hence the
additional appropriations asked 'or are larger than
they would have been under ordinary circum-
stances. How th s has happened will be explain
ed by the fact that, soon after the accesión of
5our immediate and lamented padece sor, all the
means at the disp< «al ot this Department were di- I
rected to be errployed upon the tortificauons and
other wotks for the protection of the Atlantic fion-
tier, in the manner deemed best calculated to pro-
duce the greatest possible efficiency in the shortest
time This course appeared to be called foi by
the unsettled and threatening aspect of our foreign '
relations. While the whole oí the resources at the
di.posal of this Department for this service were
thus ordered to be app'ied to such unfinished works
as couIj be made a/a lable, in whole or in part, in
a reasonable time, it is proper to state, in this con-
naction, tnat dnections were at the same time
given to supply, without delay, the works already
completed with their appropriate armament
The promptitude and liberality with which the
Governor of New York and the Commissioner of
Public Lands in that Siate íesponded to the recent
application of the Department to b> put in posses-
sion of the works constructed on Staten Island, un-
der the supervision and at the expense of thai
SUte, for the defence of New Your, harbor, de-
serve the thanks of "he country, and should be fur-
ther acknowledged by the immediate appropriation
of the sum demanded as a compensation for the
ground upon which they are situated. The works
are regarded as of great importance to the object
for which they were designed, and they are now

ment and the Guvenioi of New York, an Í the re-
port oí the Chtet Engineer, will show the terms
upon which the title to th s propel ty will be vested
in tue United States
It wnl be s.een from the accompanying report
from the Ordnance Department, that some addition-
al appropriations for that service are believed '0
be loipoiUnt to 'h>- public interest The amount
ctlled foi ¡s &220,000 The importance of ihe
cperations of tms Depaumr it, a'ld its immediate
connection with he ni'ionalc'efence, n providing
guns, gun-c;rriag s, and other mum ions, will at
once be perceived.
It is necessary that the at enlion of Congress
should be called to the poney recently adopted
in the management of the public armories The
duty of increasing, by every practicable neons, the
efficiency of these important estabhshme us, not
less than a due ieg*rd to eronomy, influence' tie
Department in giving lis sanction to the plan of
dispensi-g with the civil supeinVendencj authonzed
by law After full consideration, it was believed
that this could be safely and advantageously done.
Accordingly the armories are now in charge of
skil'ul and experienced officers of the Ordnance
Department. One defect 111 the policy of taking
superintendents from civd life, as shown by past
experience, is the want of the proper qualifications
in the persons usually sel"c'ed Some degree of
science, as well as a p\act cal knowledge in the
construction and use of arms, are ^dispensable ic-
qjisitcm the supeanlendenis. The desired ard
proper qualifications are rarely to be found unt ed
in the same person in civil life, who e services can
be commanded by the G wernm^nt Another and
mo e serious oljection to the. system of supeiv-
sion here'ofore practised is found in the defe tue
and inadequate conliol wo ch the D parlm^nt h.is
been able to excicne over Ihe supenntenden s
It his been found impossible, in some in-
stances, to enforce the most salutary regula-
tions Th- necessary deg-ee of deference
to the 01 lers a d wishes of the superior .
authority, it is mau.fest, his not been fe't This E>
probably is the inevitable result of th ■> 1 ature of tne f
interest and u-ftuence , in no manner eonnee ed
wi h the objects of these enablishmenls, which too
often control the conduct of the superintendents.
For lhece reasons, it is dee-ned of creai impoitance
that the armories should be separated, ?s far as
possib'e, from all connection wtlh the part/ politics;
of the day The force of ihe objections suggested
to a civil superintendence cinnot b bptur il'us-
trated han by the statements eo> tamed in the ac-
companying memoiandum of the Or nance Depart-
ment, whrh appears to be laken chiefly from the
correspondence between that Department and the
superintendent of the armory at Harper's Ferry.
But the expediency of continuing the superinten-
dent of these officers, must finally be decided by
Consreos Some hesitation was felt in dropping,
temporarily, the civil mpermteniencv, but as
neither of ihe la'e supenniendents, though of much
personal vvorth, was regarded as posse-.su g, in a
due desree, those particular qualificati ns which
are important in tie management of such esta-
blishments, their remo al wis thought a fit occa-
sion to m'roduce a new sysfra T in- has not yet
been allowed to test saffi-i ntly its advantages or
defects If it shall be the p'easure of Congress to
allow the existing vacancies under the law, as it
now stands, to continue for a short time, the pub-
lic interests will be subserved, whatever may be the
result of the experiment. If the policy rccommend-
el by the Ordnance Department and so far sanc-
tioned by this Department, shall succeed, it will be
well for the public service If it «hall fill, ihere
wil no longer beany pretext for future changes
and the Depart nent « i'l lork to the select on of ¡he
mo"t competent superintendents from tV waiks of
civil life and to the means of improving th« effi-
ciency of these establishments by such new regula
tions, under youí direction, as may be snjgested
by experience.
Additional  appropriations,   to   the amount ot
4825,637 86, are required by the Pay and Quar-
termaster':, Departments for the service of the pre-
s> nt year. The amount asked by the Quartermas-
ter General appears to bo indispensable. It is
ab 3Ut the sum which Congress at the last ses.ion
failed to appropna e, though included in the esti-
mates, and undi rstood to ba in part for arrearages
fur the year 1840; and a large portion of the pre-
sent demand ma/ not be improperly set down to
tie same account A portion of the sum required
by the P45, Department is for arrearages of the
\ear 1840, as will appear from the report of the
Paympstei General.
Anodier public work of great interest committed
to the care of ¡his Departm/nt deserves, some no-
tice at this time. The «urn of $75,000 was appro-
priated at the last sess.on of Congie s for clearing
out ihe Red river raft. The large sums of money
heretofore expended en this object, the h'gh expec-
tation indulged, after the inst succcsslul experi-
ment, of the piacttcabilit} of effecting . , the sub-
sequent accumula^ 1 n and ce mnua'ce oi partial
obstructions., and Use consequent disappt intmcnt of
tne public, ctused 1' e Department to ^ive Us early
aad serious attention to the subject Believing
that Congress, in making this appropriation, in-
dulged the hope that it would be all that would be
required tor the completion of the work, the De-
fa rtment resolved that the highest degree of per-
manence and utility attainable by the use of the
means plac-d at its disposal should be accom-
plished, directed that an officer of the highest
ciedit for skill and judgment should proceed with-
out delay to ascertain the nature, extent, and
e-uis , ot th" obstructions which interrupt the navi-
gat en of tb?t river, and to submit a pian for their
icmnal Tnat officer has not yet reported to the
Depaument. It is intended that the steam and
sn g boa s, after being repaired, sh^ll ascend Red
livei, while it continue .n a navigable state, to the
point f obstruction, bul it is not designed to enter
upna the work until autumn. Tms policy, as will
fallv appeal from the report of the Chief of the
Topographical Engineers, and the accompanying
letter of the superintendent^ was dictated by a
sound economy, if not by the necessity of the case.
The ageais and superintendents heretofore em-
pi >yed in the construction of the various improve-
ments on the lakes, the seaceast, and in the interi-
or, have been discharged, except such as have been
re'amed at a small compensation, to guard some of
th^ moit important works remaining in an unfi-
m hed s'a e, and the public propeity connected
wuh hem In a few instances it has been found
inexpedient to employ an agent to take care of the
property of the Government collected for the con-
struct on of ihese works, until Congress shall deter-
mine upon the question ot continuing or abandon-
ing them, wherj there was no fund out of which
they could be paid Some of the«e agents have
been paid from ihe proceeds of the 'ale oí a portion
of tl e public property, others can be paid only by
'urt' er sales or under an appropriation by Con-
rms It has also been asceitamed that ihe expen-
di'utes upon several of these work1  have exceeded
the appropriations made for their cc nstruction.
Tnese arrearages are generady due to contractors
and laborers in no way responsible for this error,
and provision should therefore be made for the
payment of them The amount necessary to dis-
charge them, as well as to pay the expenses of the
ag nts employed as above stated, appears from the
r p rt of the chief of the corps of topogiaphical en-
gi eert, to be $39 997 12
The «ubject oí the expediency of completing the
Cumberland road, and of improving certain har-
bor, and the naviga'iou of c nam great rivers,
which may be regarded as nece ¡,ary and proper
in making adequate pioviston for the public defence,
I propose to postpt ne the further notice of until
tt e sia ed session of Congress, as the consideration
o! it will involve ihe propriety of making aporopn-
a ions tor various w^rks of internal in proveonent
n it necessarily connected with that oojeet, and,
consequently, will require moie time iban Con-
gress, at its approaching session, may find it con
venient to give.
At the late sess on of Congress, the sum of
S30,000 was appropriated to be expended, under
the direction of this department, in repairing the
