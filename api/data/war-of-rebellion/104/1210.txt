HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 6, 1865.

Captain FRY,

Commanding Stamer Morgan:

CAPTAIN: I take it for granted after seeing you in conversation with General Maury, that you have received instructions from him to give to General Gibson all the assistance possible in protecting his flanks and water approaches. Should this, however, not be the case, I request that you will go down to Spanish Fort, or as near to that place as will enable you to accomplish so desirable an object. General G. Is hard pressed and unable to look after his water approaches, and you can do so to a very great extent. I have requested (in connection with this Captain Bennett, of the Nashville, to go as far as Tracy to aid you in covering the left flank of Spanish Fort, on Bay Minette.

I am, captain, yours, respectfully,

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 6, 1865-1.30 a. m.

There are strong indications that this position will be assaulted at daylight, especially on my left flank.

General MAURY:

Nothing unusual to report. Enemy is pressing forward his lines by the usual zigzags. Can't I get a company of sappers and miners? I hope you will come over to-day.

The general appeared in three barges last night and attempted to cut the telegraph line to destroy the pits. They were promptly driven off. Can't you send a gun-boat to fire into the enemy's right flank? Please look over the dispatches I have sent you within two days.
