HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Camp Winfield Scott, April 20, 1862.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I inclose herewith a letter to General Burnside, which will explain itself. I think there should be no delay in sending him the cavalry and artillery asked for.

I would beg to suggest the propierty, if possible, of recruiting for Burnside's regiments, as the most effective manner of bringing up his force. Recruits scattered among his veteran regiments will be much more effective than the same number of men formed into new regiments.

Our works are progressing well to-day. Very little firing.

General Holmes, of the rebel army, was ordered to North Carolina in command one week after the fall of New Berne. General E. K. Smith went to East Tennessee about five weeks ago.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
