HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 17, 1864. (Send 10.15 p.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

A later deserter states the assault will be made at daylight. That seems to be an hour when an attack would be made if one is really designed. The commanding general thinks that instead of having the whole of the division under arms, if a part of it is kept up ready to rouse the remainder, who should have everything prepared to fall in the ranks, it would answer as well.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
