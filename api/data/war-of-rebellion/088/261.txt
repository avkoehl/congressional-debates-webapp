CITY POINT, VA., August 18, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

General Warren moved with his corps this morning to and across the Weldon road about one mile south of the lead-works. To that point he met nothing but the enemy's pickets. He advanced from there toward Petersburg, meeting the enemy early in his advance. He had considerable fighting during the day, suffering some loss and inflicting loss upon the enemy. I have no report showing the extent of our losses, but judge them to be light, from the dispatches. Some of the enemy's wounded fell into our hands and a few other prisoners.

U. S. GRANT,

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-2.15 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK:

The firing is in front of the Ninth corps. No report has been made, but I have sent for one.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-2.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK:

The cannonading and mortar practice was along the whole line-Eighteenth and Ninth corps. No one seems to know how it began or the cause. It is probably the enemy feeling to see if we are still here.

It is now subsiding.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

Major-General MEADE:

Have your heard what progress General Warren is making?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
