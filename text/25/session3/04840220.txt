cedents and law, but, never, sir, to the arbiti u-y
extent to which its privileged orders have earned I
ii, nor, where its monarchical and aristocratic I
features come in conflict with rules or principles
of constitutional hbeity, essential to the exist- j
ence of fieedom m a Republic     We, sir, have ¡
adopted written íules for oui proceedings, and I i
have in vain called upon gentlemen to show one ,
of these luleswhuch has been violated     Are wo,
under the examples of the  Butish Pari anient,
which has no restraint upon its power, but claims
and exeicises unlimited authority, to step beyond
the Constitution and our own written rules, con-
stitute ouiselves a censor mm urn—look into the
private conduct of our membeis, and, at a discre-
tion as aibitraiy as it would make us odious,
airaign and try eveiy member whose habits or
pimciples may be disagreeable to us'   Shall we
exeiciae, in defiance of the Constitution which
protects it, a censorship over the freedom of his
pen, and of the press3 The right to discuss men
and measures'   Let it not be said theie is no
remedy but herefoi viplations of private feelings,
for coaise or vulgar or unbecoming publications
The couits, both of civil and cummal jurisdic-
tion, are open, and if they were not, this House
has no right to assume eithei their appiopinte
duties nor those of a court of honor, when its
own privileges aie not violated                                 '
The next powei given by this section of the
Constitulion is "to punish members for disoi-
deily beliaviot " Disorderly hehivioi where, sn'
Does any man doubt, oi hasitevei been doubted,
that it was heie, sn, in the pioccedings of this
House or its committees' Foi interrupting the
business of the country, intei feting with or ob-
structing us Legislature in its high duties'
But the remaining power given is m words
larger and moie unlimited " And, with the con-
cuuence of two thuds, expel a membei," and
this, sir, was the indication of the first ícsolu-
tion, an indication ominous and without prece-
dent in this land of law and liberty * Is it, will
it be, pretended that this power of expulsion is a
power to do it without good cause ' Is it left to
the House to cxeicise it in capuce' Is theie no
reasonable mle to be observed in its exoicise '
If the powct is to be considenil a naked un-
qualified power, you may exoicise it with or
against nason Theie is no n striint, no safe ty
You may cx.pt I a mimbei b< canoe his coat is not
i ut in the fashion—b< cause he turns Ins toes in,
instead of out win n he walks—because his atti-
tudes are notgiaecful, noi his voice melodious—
oi because his punnpks do not phase you, oi
las politics offend Oi, sn, you m ly follow liim
out of this House, spy into his pi i vate behavior,
impeach him of immoral conduct, of degiading
and debxsing habits, of being a debauchee, a
drunlcaid, ot a gamblci, oi of conduct < ven moie

" Resolve í, i hat Matthew Lj on, ame mberof tins House,

revo't'og, and bring him up in this House, and
expel him under this section No, sir, no The
pi oposition is too monstrous The moment you
act on principles so vague and undefined, you
leave the landmarks of law, and are in the dun
and shadowy regions of discretion, ever unpro-
pitious to constitutional and well íegnlated lib
crty In naked truth, you create a despotism
You are, sir, substituting the will of a majority
for the law, and turning loose that mijoutyto
act as prejudice, the passions of the moment,
angry and excited by paity collisions and party
objeots, may hurry them to establish precedenls
which you m turn may be giound down under,
when your opponents gain the ascendency The
experience of all time and the wisdom of ages
tell us to bridle the passions and fortity the judg-
ment Could the fi amera of the Constitution
have intended to íeverse this íule, and give in
this section unlimited license to power' Never,
sn, never Then, sir, let this House pause be-
foie it acts upon this vague authouty—or who,
sn, will be safe in 01 out of youi walls'
This is not all The powei given is " to ex-
pel " The resolution pioposes "to censuie
AiB.tAVDi.it Ddvca>j " Even thus softened
down to coniiliUe suppoit, this lisolution is, in
my judgment, unconstitutional I see no right,
no powet in this House to pass it
But, sir, even if theie was a pow ei in the House
to act, still I will say it was deseiving of giave
consideiation whether it would be expedient to
exeiciseit The powei to do so, at best, is of
exceedingly doubtful right Whethei the pnvi-
lcgcs. of the House go beyond those expiessly
giantcd in the Constitution, 01 where they have
been defined by rules of the House, 01 by law
solemnly passed, has. been frequently and much
questioned by some of the best minds in the
country I shall not hete enter into that wide
field, further than to say that I go with neither
oxti ernes of opinions on this subject I neithei
go for the unlimited parliaments y discietion nor
fordisairvung either House of Congiess of the
power of si If piotection I should ¿onsidei this
House reduced to the most deploiable helpless-
ness and contempt, if it had not the power to
protect itself and its membeis while in tin elis-
1 harge of then high duties, to shield them fiom
violence 01 impediment It has ample powers
for doing so 1 h ive hiietofoie spiead upon the
lecoids of this House my opinions on tins sub
]ect I then said, sn, and I now repeat, th it
"while it is essential foi the vindication of the
puvilegcs and dignity of the House, that Us powei
shall be sometimes exeicised, it should he done
(illy tn crises oj stiong necessity, and never earned
beyond what is absolutely and impellously re-
quired by the existing emeigcm y " There is" a
wise je alousy against powei in this count) y Its
piomness to abuse is well understood by the
people Tiie dictate of a wise modeiation should
admonish us to foibcai its exercise in doubtful
cases,especially when they involve vita] questions
oi high political and personal rights In moments
of calmness the judgment of all men will agiee
to this "When tins House tindei takes to asseit
privilege and cxeit powei, it should be a chai
case of light andduty, it should be with dehbcia-
tion, not passion—in defense, not in vcrgeance,
and its action should be tempeied by as much of
the spmt of modeiation, nay of indulgence even,
for the infitmities of natuio, as can be made to
comport with what is due to justice and its own
dignity Nor should the House foiget that it is
itself the accusei, the law maker, the witness,
the piosecutoi, and the judge in us own case,
and that fiom its sentence there is no appeal
I ask the House if this proceeding is in the
calm spun of judicial mquiiy' If the boisteious
and angi y passions which have been heaving and
tossing the judgment of membeis to and fio since
it besan, buisting ovei the legitimate boundiries
of calm and decoious debate, have fitted us to
decide this grave and impoitaiit matter with the
caution and prudence its magnitude demands ' Is
it the calm judgment of the House, or excited
feelings, which has biought this ease upfoi tinl'
Do we not all -ee the diiheulty which gentlemen
have, to define the offense of the member from
Ohio, to point to the law he has tians^rcssed'
What is it that has made him amenable to the
judicial action of the House' He is not arraigned
because he has committed any offense within these
walls against the íules of Us proceeding, or the
law, or the Constitution' Has he impeded the
action of this House, or its committees, or any
membei of it, 111 the discharge o*" their duties'
Has he assaulted, challenged, 01 obstructed, or
disabled the House, its committees, 01 any mem-
ber of it, so that they, or any one of them, have
been hindered for one moment fiom ftee and full
service to the countty and th<ur constituents'
No, su , not so Howevei gieat his offe use may
be consideied agairst othei tubunals, against
this, the only one alleged or put in issue by his
accuseis, is the publication in the Globe—just
such an offense as is daily and houi ly commuted
in every newspaper, and as will be to the end of
time in every free countiy, just Such a publica-
tion as got the Senate of the United States, 111
1800, into its difficulty with William Dunne, the
cditoi of the Auroia newspapei That cditoi, a
Republican, made stnctuies on the Fedeial Sen-
ate, which it íesented as "false, defamatory,
scandalous, and malicious," and an attack on
then high puvilegcs He was summoned to then
bar to be tiled foi it, and, eventually, lefusmg to
appeal, he was auested by vvatiant fiom the
Senate and punished—foi what'do you suppose,
sir, the bieach of pnviloge' No, su , no, they
dared not do lhat, but they punished him for a
contempt mnot appealing, in obedience to their order,
at then bai Ovei that they had junsdiction, but
on " sobei second thought" they let fall the ques-
tion of privilege, and ended the affair by passing
the following lesolution
' Resolved, That the President of the Unite d States be
reque ted to instinct the proper law officer to commence
and cairv on a prosecution asamst William Duane, editor
ol n newspaper e died the Auiora, for certain false, delam
atoiy, sc mdalous, and malicious publications in said news-
papei, of the 19th of Febril try last past, u nding to cíclame
the Senate of tin United <st ites, and to nnngthein intocon
ti mpt and dure pute, and to excite against them the hatred
ot the pe iple of the United Slates "Senate Journal, vol
3  pag( 9b
Thus, sn, even 111 that day of Fedeial usurpa-
tion, did the fiee pimciples of the Constitution
achieve a tnumph, and the Senate, with all its nr-
ístociatic tendencies, feel itself compelled to yield
its untenable and hiiih handed proceduie to a lulo
of conduct mo 10 confoi mable to the constitutional
lights of the people Let us pause heie, su , ere
we aie caught m the like piedicament, and com-
pelled to retiace oui steps, 01, if we peisist, are
íebuked and condemned by an enlightened and
mdignint public opinion
The gentleman tiom Mississippi called my at-
tention to the case of a challenge I have, in the
íeport, fiom winch the cluk read an extiact, sta-
ted my opinion, that " to challenge a membei to
fight a duel, dunng the session oí Congress,
while he is attending to his ptiblie duties, is a
bieach of puvilege," and I have, sn, in thatie-
port, given my leasons fully foi that opinion, to
which I lefei the gentleman But, sn, why this
question now' Has it anything to do with the
pioposed measuie against the gentleman fiom
Ohio' Has any challenge pissed' No, sir Is
the member fiom Ohio to be punished for what
he has not done ' In the resolution, which is the
indictment, not one woid is said of a challenge
The ctuse alleged is, that " he had wiitten, and
caused to be published in the Globe newspanei,
the following publication, "&c Why, then, whilst
in the resolution he is charged, and on tual,for the
offense of writing and publishing this article in the
Globe, are we leferred to the doctune of puvilege
embraced in challenges' Is it, sn, that while we
hold the member on tnal, under one charge,
which is not tenable in law, he may be convicted
undei the othei, for which there is law > The
case made against him cannot be varied It is
there wiitten in due and solemn foim Itpiopo-
ses fo punish, foi no act done 111 this House, nor
within its privileges, 1101 as a membei, but out of
it, in the excicise of his lights as a citizen, and
foi which he is answeiable to the courts of law,
foi allimpioper indulgence 1 ike jurisdiction of
this case, and you aie at sea    The same pnnciple
I will eovei eveiy newspaper attack upon a mem-
bei of the House Punish him, and you may
punish all offending in like cases     How many
1 will have to be tned by you'   Can you count
