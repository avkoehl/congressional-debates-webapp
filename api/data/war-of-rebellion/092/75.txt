his department, for his careful record and disposition of prisoners, and for his unremitting attention to the comfort and interest of myself and staff, while acting in his capacity of commandant of headquarters.

No department of this army has been better conducted on this campaign than the medical. To Asst. Surg. D. L. Huntington, acting medical director, is due great praise for his diligence and eminent success. To him and to Doctor Duncan, the staff surgeons, the officers and soldiers at headquarters of the army are indebted for all the medical aid they required.

Major C. H. Howard, senior aide-de-camp, is commended for his diligence, in causing my orders to be executed, in bearing dispatches by perilous and distant routes, and for affording me sympathy and moral support of one who identifies himself completely with the interests of the service.

Captain W. M. Beebe, Jr., additional aide-de-camp, receives my thanks for his generous assistance, being over anxious to undergo any risk, or perform a gallant action.

Captain F. W. Gildreth, aide-de-camp, is always at the post of duty, and has spared no pains to carry my orders promptly, and see them executed.

Lieutenant E. Blake, staff quartermaster and commissary of subsistence, has shown himself remarkably efficient, and has often received my special thanks.

Captain E. H. Kirlin, chief of scouts, has carefully reconnoitered the country through Captain William Duncan and the other scouts, and kept me well advised of the movements of the enemy.

Lieutenant J. A. Sladen has cheerfully aided me, writing at my dictation, bearing dispatches, and keeping important records.

My recommendations for the promotion of general and staff officers have already been forwarded and will be found separate in duplicate accompanying this report.

The General-in-chief has been enabled, under a Providential care, not to be mistaken to conduct our noble army thus far to results that one year ago seemed scarcely possible of attainment. He has secured our complete confidence, and, therefore, it may not be improper for me to express the faith that it is our mission, under his direction, to give the finishing blow to this hated rebellion. *

Please find accompanying this a statistical record for the campaigns.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
