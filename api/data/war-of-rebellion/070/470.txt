HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, May 16, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

While the engineers were engaged in removing the pontoon bridge, several boats were swept away, carrying four or five men, who were saved. A part of the trestle work of the railroad bridge has already given way. I expect the rest will follow at any moment. Communication is quite cut off. I will send one Ohio regiment to Baltimore as soon as it can be done.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, May 16, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

The railroad bridge has a portion of it gone, and we fear for the rest. The river is still very high. No communication with the other side.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, May 16, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

The wooden portion of the railroad bridge has entirely gone, and it will be some ten days before communication can be re-established. The quartermaster reports that he has on hand supplies for ten days only for the force now at this place. We must have, as soon as possible, pontoons to replace those lost to-day and rebuild the bridge.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier-General.
