Lia                                             CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
Aaoiher material error oí fact, committed by the
Senator, was to suppose that under the revision of
the tariff made at i&e extra session as much has
been received in 1841 as was imposed in expenses
in 1841 by the laige new appropriation^ passed at
ths extra session. Í admit that some drawbacks
were reduced in the last three months of the year.
But the Senator has overlooked that all the nev?
duties accruing under the amendments of the tariff
were, with slight exceptions, on three and six
months credits, and consequentlyííhat none of them,
instead of one or two millions, as he computes,
would fall due and be therefore received in 1841__
nose.
At this moment Mr. WALKER expressed a de-
sire to say something upOR the subject before it
passed from the Senate. When, on motion of Mr.
MERRICK,
The Senate adjourned.

Mr. ATIIERTON wanted to know the euzcioftne motion—
whether, if it pi evaded, the House would gc into Committee of
the Whole on this subject for to-day only, it would be recol-
lected, he said, that by a resolution adopted on Saturday, the
Committee on the Judiciary was directed to rcpoit to-morrow a

tion that would prevent th-t commutee from repon mg in the

F. was understood to add) on the reconnaendaMon of ihe De-
partment.
The- CHAIRMAN said that the pendmg question wvs on ths
amendment just proposed by the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. Fillmore.]
Mr. SAUTIj oí Virginia wished that the gentleman from New
York would explain what was the object of the amendment
whiáh he had suggested.
Mr. FiLLMOFvE said that the object would be very obvious",
by looking at thisbi'l, and at the billa of asimilar chaiacter,
which had been heretofore passed.
The object of the bill, of course, was to provide for the pre-
sent wants of the Treasury; but,thebii!,as it now stood, would
anly authorize the issue of Treasury notes in place of those
redeemed, which would not at all provide for the exigencies
of the Treasury. It was a clerical error in the drawing up of
the bill.
The question on the proposed amendment of Mr Fiixmobe
was then taken, and decided in the affirmative, without a divi-
sion.
So the amendment was agreed to,
Mr. FILLMORE said there was a corresponding amendment,
merely verbal, which he desired to offer. It was to strike out
from the end oí the 11th line to the end ofthe 14th, the following
words';
'■And as modified by an act entitled 'An act additional to the
act on the subject of Treasury notes,' approved the 31st of
March, ÍS40  
Which amendment was also agreed to.
Mr. WELLER said that notwithstanding the remarks of the
gentleman fiom Virginia, [Mr. Wise,] he felt it his duty to offer
an amendment to the bdl embracing m part, the proposition,
which he had withdrawn In doing ttm?, he wished it d^tinctiy
understood thin hisobject was not to embarrass the bill, (for,
with arnod-Geauon of the proviso, ho was pieparedto vote for
it,) butto res'oie to the Treasury for the relief oí tho piecing
wan's vf the Government, afund which.'in b-3 opinion, had been
unconstitutionally t^keri from it. At all evrins, h"1 desired to
have .t vote «if'he committee on hi? proposition. The land re-
vnentie. said ho, was given to the States no doubt for the purpose
of raising their credits, but the opposite rfieci had neen pro*
duee-t. ¿late credit hail gone down -still lower under the ope-
ration, and we had increased the embarrassments of th«fi ene tal
Government without conferring auv benefit upon State stocks.
We must now look to our own credit, for unless provision 13
soon made to relieve the Treasury, that v,->¡: bs no better than
the credit of the States. Why, then, should wo permit the pro-
ceeds afsing from the sales ofthe public lauds to be disttibnted
amongst the States, while we aie compelled to resort to forced
Jopos and the issue of Treasury notes to sustain oor own credit?
Why notapproprinte that /und 10 the redemoMon ofthe notes
we are now compelled to issue? 1 am, Paid Mr. W. opposed to
this policy of giving away whilst we are borro wins to supply
our own wrmts. liesVle?, said he, in issuing Tieasury notes,
provision should he immediately made for (heir redemption.
Tu t rYect this object as far as practicable, lie oifoied his amtnd-
merit.
Mr W. said, whether his amendment succ^dedoi* not, he
felt difpmed to go for the bi!'. vrith a sh^in modmeation of the
¡ rovi'o which he wTnuld Piovc of tho pioper time. lie had
voted m the hist Congress 101* the issue of Treasury notes, ar-d
h-1 wdi not disponed to oppose this bid merely h^cau^e it came
íroin ?n Adoiinístiation which ho did not sapport. Whenever,
K'iid be, the si'oafion of the T'e^pry reipurea immediate :e-
li-f, he vv-aa ready to act. The :r?cc:Liaiy tells tía that unless
this bill is pisset!, the drafts upon the 'í-iovernm^ní mi«?t be
protc-?ied, and the pubhc creditor remain unpaid. He, ívv
one, could no' refuse to do ah ¡n his power to" avert such a
state of things. Mere party considerations could not ínfitrnce
Iiio tonJuct, when the h>'nnr and'''edit 01 the (.Government
wuro at stíke. fíe was ready at all time's to do everv ihmq
which the Constitution sanctioned, to preserve the public faith
or the national hrncr.
Mr WFLLEIltheo ofibrcd the following amendme;¡¡'
^jírTioN'^. Ave' be it furlher enar'cd, That «o much of the
act p-iwsed on the 4ih day of September. 1811, enticed -'Anact

su-peoded; and that the paid fund &htd! be applied to the pay-
men* (if the outstanding Treasmy notes as well as those autho-
rized to h>' issued under this act.
Mr I'll A. MORE submitted to the Chair that tho amend-
ment of the jQon'ieioan fr°ni Ohio [Mr. Wt:li.e;;] was out of
otder, on 'he'eiound that it was not relevant to the subject mat-
ter of the bill.
Mr. PROFFÍT believed that the arnendment was m or-
fVr. though b". would have been glad if the -jentleman from
Ohio had not introduced it here, and appealed to him to with-
draw if.
Mr. G1LMETI subuMtted that the debate wis out of order until
the decision of the Chair had been made, and an appeal taken
therefrom

If the Chair, however, should be wrong in this opinion, another
and a still more formidable difficulty ilea 10 the way of the pro-
posed amendment.
On the 7th of July last Mr. Fit-lmore, from the Committee
of WaysandMeans, reported a bid making appropriations for
various fortifications and other purposes, winch bill was read
a first and second time, and a motion made by the gentleman
who reported that bilí to commit the same to a Committee of
the Whole House on the stale of .the Union. Mr. Atherton
thereupon moved to amend the motion to commit, by adding
"with instructions to reporta provision that the proceeds ofthe
sales ofthe public lands shall be appropriated and appjied to
the defence ofthe country in the completion of the worlts spe-
cified in the bill, and shall be thus applied and appropriated
yearly, until the said works shall be completed."
This motnn was ruledby the Speaker to be out of order, on
the ground that the House had the day before passed the bill to
appropriate the proceeds of the sales ofthe pubbc lands, had
thereby determined m what manner the proceeds of the sales of
the public lands should be disposed of, and that it was not then
in order, upon a bill on a different subject, to propose a different
mode of disposing of said proceeds From this decision of the
Speaker Mr. Atherton appealed, and the appeal was laid upon
the table by a vote ol ayes IOS, nays 77. The decision was
therefore acquiesced in by the House, and must, until reversed,
be regarded as the law of all similar questions. The Chair con-
siders thatdecision as conclusive of the question here, and the
Chair does not feel at liberty" to distegard a decision thus sanc-
tioned by the House. A chairman d^esnot sit here to expound
rules according to his own arbitrary views. A justdeference
for the opinions of his iellows should constrain him to give to
precedent its proper influence, and until the House shall re-
verse them* to give them al! the ronsideiation which is due to
cases heretofore settled by a solemn decision ofthe House.
Mr. McKEON appealed frem the decision of the Chair. Ir
his opinion, there was no incongruity between the subject of
the amendment and that of the bill. The bill proposed to issue
five millions of notes to meet the immediate necessities of the
Government, and what was tho piopusmon contained in the
amendment? Any thing foreign to tliat'i No. It was to pro-
vide the ways and means to meet the issue of notes contem-
plated by tiie bill. The subjects were so nearly allied, that he
was surprised that any one should doubt it; for it certainly
miut always be m order to incorporate in a bill for a loan of any
kind, a measure for us redemption. Mr. M. referred to a pre-
cedent in 183G, when a provision was inserted in the fortifica-
tion bill, to deposite with the States the surplus that would be
in the Treasury oh the first of January ensuing; and if
such a provision could be mseited m an appropriation
bid, surely a Treasury note bill might contain a provision
to meet the issue of notes intended by it.
Mr. CLIFFORD oí Mame observed-that the probability was
that the decision of the Chair would be sustained by the House,
ami that nothing that could b3 said would have the effect to
chango that decision. Notwithstanding this might be the esse,
yet he wished, before the vote Wiss taken, toaseign briefly his
reasons why he should not /ote to sustain the dec-ifeion oí the
Chair. What was the subject matrer ofthe bilP, It was to bor-
lo w money to provide f r the immediate and prying necessi-
ties of the Government. What was the subject matter of the
amendment.' It was topruvídea fund for 'In redemption of
tne paper that was to be issued to effect thw loan- Now the
rule that the Chair bad referred to was, that no motion on a
subject differing from the bid under cons nation, should
be submitted under color of an amendment. 'Ihia rule
was first adopted in 1789, and yet, the very n<~xt ye.^r, the mem-
bers of the (Congress who adopted it, mcorfcatcd in the bill
making* provision for the debt^ of theUriJitd States, a sec (ion
deciaimgthat the proceeds of the sales of úí° pnhhc binds shall
be appropriated for the object ¡a view, it was precisely the
&arae thing that was intended by the present amendment, with
this difference only; thatucw it was necessary to repeal an ex-
isting law. and then no 1 iw itood in the way of the provision,
liut the House would bear in mind that the repeal ofthe law
was not the subject 01 the amendment, it was only the inci-
dent. The subject was to provide a fimd for the 1 exemption of
the notes that might be issued under the bill, and the suspension
or 1 epeal of the law was only incidental to that object. He un-
derstood (he chairman to ?¿y that it woo M be m order to incor-
porate in the bill a provision for the fund that was to meet the
notes to be issued, and that being so, we may, said Mr. C. sweep
away every obstacle that is m the way. The amendment was
a legitimate object; and was in accordance with the sound and
wholesome doctrine laid down by Mr. Jefferson years ago, that
Congress should never authorize the issue of Tieasury notes
without providing at the same time a fund for their redemp-
tion. Anxious as he was to sustain the credit of the Govern-
ment, and to provide for the necessities of the Treasury, he did
not see how he could, consistently with his views of the Consti-
tution, vote for this bill withouuome provision similar to that
contained in the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio. He
regretted much that the Chair bad come to the decision that be
had given It seemed to him that theru'e the Chair relied o¿j, did
apply to the present ocri.-^on. The question w.i^ whether, m
authorizing un ls&ue of Trrasory note*, they miirbt provide a
fund for their reden'vUinn. It ihey could not do it in the way
proposed, he knew of no other way by y,hii h v. could be done.
After some further ¡emaik^ from Sit  0,
Mr. TILUNGUAST dddiepscd the House m support of ihe
decision of tho Chan7
Mr. MAXWELL expressed the. opinion that the amendment
was out of order, but M.d 'hat if the Hese eh^-e to decide it
to be morder, lie should havo no objection In thatevtnt,
however be would himself offer an amendment to the amend-
ment, pr-'Vidmg that sumueliuf the act commonly cabed the
compróme actas thrert- a diminution of duties !u*m this time
be ¡suspended until pome subsequent ijm<\ and that so much
additional funds a¿¡ should come into the Tieasury from that
srjice ?'.?:\ be applied as a fund lor the redemption of Trea-
iii'v nor «.
Mr HOLMES believed the amendment to hi'ir order, but
s5 ou'd voie against it, for he deemed the necessities'of tho
coimMy—the di*s*iaceful position m wh'fh trie Tinted Stite^
hadli^ri phwrduy the exuas-ásmn—such, that the immediate
action of ilonqre^s was indi-^p-Jiis dilo.
Some f i Dter remartw were mido by Messrs. CORDON
and CHAKLESHKOWN, against the decision of the Chair,
Pnd by Messrs. RTTRNELL, JOHNSON of Maryland, and
LEWIS WILLIAMS, miavor of it.
Mr. SMITH of Virginia rosa meieiy for the purpose of mak-
ing afew brief lernarks touching the subject before the House,
