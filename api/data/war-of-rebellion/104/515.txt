Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Sherman has directed me to open a supply line for my command by the way of Dalton and Atlanta. It will require --- days to repair the road. There are but few materials and means for that purpose to be had at the end of the line. Please give the necessary instructions to have the work begun at Dalton and pushed forward as rapidly as possible to Atlanta. I am making arrangements to have everything done from this end that our means will permit. General cobb has turned over all the Confederate supplies under his control on Southwestern Railroad, and done all in his power to assist us in buying from the people, but it will be difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity of forage to last till the new crops is ready for use. We shall soon begin to need small stores and clothing. They might be sent from Savannah to Augusta, or up the Altamaha and Ocmulgee to Buzzard Roost. Both State and Confederate authorities seem anxious to give me all the assistance in their power. The people are well disposed and anxious for peace. By an arrangement with General Cobb I have paroled all of the prisoners captured in Georgia, besides the remnant of those brought from Alabama. If Croxton's brigade were moved to Dalton it could protect the railroad repairers in that quarter in case a guard shall become necessary. There is enough C. S. A. cotton in store here to pay for opening the road.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Since writing my last telegram General Croxton has joined me with his command in fine condition. After burning Tuscaloosa, capturing three guns and a number of prisoners, he moved toward Columbus, fought Wirt Adams near Eutaw, moved thence to Hanby's Mills, on Black Warrior, crossed Coosa near Talladega, fought and dispersed General Hill's forces between there and Blue Mountain, burned several factories and iron-works, and then marched, via Carrollton, Newman, and Zebulon, to this place. General Croxton deserves great credit and should be brevetted.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
