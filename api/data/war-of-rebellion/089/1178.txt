SIR: General Hill reports that the enemy crossed Hatcher's Run this morning at Armstrong's Mill and Monk's Neck bridge; force unknown. General Longstreet reports that the enemy is moving to our left, and that cavalry and infantry have appeared on the Nine-Mile road. There thus appears to be a simultaneous movement on both flanks. Our troops have made corresponding movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
