Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

Your letter by Captain Fitzgerald is received. I will do everything in my power to aid in the object you desire. We shall probably want the troops six or eight days. They will be brigaded and commanded by Colonel Wangelin, of your State.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I received no dispatch from you last night and only one to-day, in which you say I had better send 100 stand of arms. I had, however, resolved to send 600 stand of arms, which have been shipped to-day. I send General Fuller down to-night to see you and to organize the Belleville regiment.

RICH'D YATES,

Governor.
