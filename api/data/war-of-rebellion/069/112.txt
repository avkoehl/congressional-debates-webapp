Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of Navy:

Monitors particle at Howlett Battery, firing 15-inch shell with great occurrence, but with no chance of stopping the progress of this commanding rebel work. The 15-inch is a great gun truly. Last night the enemy attacked the army, and were handsomely repulsed. Navy was in a position to fire if desired by signal from army, but no signal was made by army, as the direction of firing must be uncertain over high hills and woods.
