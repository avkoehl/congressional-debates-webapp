Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Black,
H. of Reps, gj
of silks at the South? They have grown into ge-
aeirat,nay into almost umverfal use, they areno
longer to be looked en as luxuries, al least not as
lixOTles confined to the use of the rich Almost
every man, poor or rich, m the region w%ere
I reside indulges his wife and daughter in the use
of this elegant and substantial article. To the
extent then, sir |to which silks are used at the South,
ar«r the cotton goods of Northern manufactories
excluded. The manufacturer sharpened by his
interest, sees and feels this—prompted by his cupi-
dity, and regardless of our rights and preferences,
he is now striking at the imports of silk by attempt
¿ngjo tax them with a duty of 20 per cent By
yottr existing laws they are free—our farmers'
wives and daughters, under this free importation,
can afford to wear them as n ell as the wives and
daughters ot the wealthy merchants, or the bankers,
but raise the duty 20 per cent almost one-fourth of
the value of ibe article, and tack on to it cash
duties, and a home valaation, and you effectually
deny to the poorm^n what the wealth of his neigh-
bor may still enable him to enjuy. TV manufac-
turer thui hopes to expel silks from the South and
to fill up the vacuum with hi  own cotton fabrics
Strange to *ay, this expulsion of silks has been
urgeo" as an f unanswered and an unanswerable
aigument" why the South should acquiesce in a
tax on wines and silks, that in proportion as silk
was expelled, the consumption of cotton would be
increased This would undoubledly be a hard ar-
gument in the mouth of a Northern manufacturer,
bucwhen used by a Southern man to the South, the
reply is evident and conclusive Although this ex-
pulsion of silk might compei us to consume more
of the manufactured article, 1 deny that i twould in-
crease the consumption of the raw material, in
wjtich the produceer is mainly interested, for even
as tbiogs now are, the home factories are fully sup.
plied, and any increased supply of the unwrought
staple m that quarter would slut the market, ands ill
farther reduce i s diminished value In addition to
the compulsion upon which this "ddional consump
lion would be based, it would not only be destruc
Uve of the advantages resulting from free bade,
but it would be closing a profitable foreign market,
from whence our cotton is not returned to us,
and substituting therefor a less profitable mar-
ket at the North from which we should receive
Jayment for the raw material in the same commo-
ity wrought op, being made to pay, in the maan
time, the profits of the manufacturer. U not this
x "protection" of Northern manufacturers at the
expense of our constituents? And yet my colleague
is willing to lend his aid to a measure which will
surely effect it So we see that piefemon, at least
in this case, is one thing, and practice quite an
other.
Mr. Chairman, this tax on wines and silks is a
hhw struck directly at the South—at the cot'on
and tobacco growing States. By the treaty < f Pa
ns, concluded in 1831, a system of commercial re-
ciprocity was established between the French and
this country highly beneficial to both parties, and
injurióos to no one Under that trea'y our com-
merce with Prance, which before was comparative-
ly limited, extended it elf rapidly, an 1 was main-
tained principally by tne experts of Southern cot-
ton For a period of five } e rs past our exports to
French ports have varied, in roun^ number , from
eighteen millions lo twenty millions per annum, of
which thp erpe rts of cotton alone amounted lo be
tween thirteen and seventeen millions a«nnal!y, the
balancebem  of tobacco and rue Now, in*read
of sending back to ti% as the English do, the greater
part of th s cotton, in wrought goods and thus «ad-
dling us as consumers with all the intermediate ex-
penses accrui' g on the commodity from i's produc-
tion to its con omptton, the French return to us
only about one milium t f cotton manufactures an
Dually, nearly the whole ba anee being paid to us
in silks and wines. They the i consume among
triemselves, one year with another, an average of
quite fifteen millions of Southern en ton, to say no
thing of nee and tobacco, tor which, as I said be-
fore, they pay us with their silks and wines Wow,
put a tax of 20 per cent, on these ¡mieles, and cou-
ple with it, as you must, if you maintain the com-
promise act, cash duties and a borne valuation, and
what do tou effect1 Why, you clone up this out-
let for our cotton by taxing, almost to prohibition,
the very aitic'es with whteh alone the French can
pay us for our raw material. What further do you
effect? Why, you throw back annually upon
the hands of the planters $15,000,000 worth of
their cotton France cannot buy it, England is
supplied without it, and, moreover, is preparing to
grow her own cotton, you have stifl d the fo-
reign maraet by your legislation, and the Northern
weaver steps in and tuys it at five or sx cents per
pound A propi'ious state of affairs for the farmer'
Cut, notwithstanding, my colleague is wil ing, not
only to maintain the compromise, but to tax w nes
and silks, at the suggestion of one of the rankest
tariff men in this House.
Again, sir, m proportion as you depress the com-
merce of Fi a ice, the friend and supporter of our
colonial strugges for liberty and a national exist-
ence, yon elevate that of Great Bn am    These
two nations are the only great rivals tor our trade,

thing to swell her commercial  importance o/er the

serva ive principie "
Mr. Chairman, I may not repeat the identical
words of my colleaaue, but the substance of what
he said about the Tariff will long be remembered
by me It v. as noticed by every e ne around me, par-
ticularly by the Democrats, as a most extraordinary
speech for a Southern man to make any where, but
more especially in the presence oí tariff men,
and Northern manufacturers. I rever heard a
speeeh more thoroughly imbued, in my opinion,
with tre principles of pro'rehon t nd dvamtnalion
than the remarks of that gentleman as they were
delivered to this Hou<e. How they will appear on
paper, I cannot say—I only «peak of my impres-
sion from what I heard He said sabstan íallj, if
not m hec verba, that formerly the peopl> of Geor-
gia were rabid on the tariff question—that it had
q* en a mad-dog cry anieng us. He remembered
the time when any mm who ventured to speak
in favor of a tanft would be withered by the indig-
nation of the people of Georgia, but, iaid he, that
day has past, "Ihan'csto the events of the last summer'"
Now the intelligence of his constituents enabled
ihem to think and «peak c">lmly upon that subject "
Ah? the events of the last summer—have they
wrought this marvellous "change!" Have the
events of the last summer cast an oblivion on the
old antipathies of tne people of Georgia? Sir, in
the name of the people of that State, I deny the
asser'ion, and all the deductions that may be drawn
therefrom. What changes those events may have
made in the gentleman, I cannot divine, but ibis
much I can say, that, from present appearance*, he
has not only lost his old honor of a tariff, but he has
ventured to walk boldly up to the monster He can
now look it coolly and celmly in the face, nay, he
even dares to touch and handle it without any ap-
parent concern. Ere long, sir, he may have "his
foot m the stirrup and his hand on the mane."
Well, that honorable gentleman certainly has a
right to mount what hobby he pleases—provided he
rides in his individual capacity, but in his official
character 1 protest against the course he has thought
proper to pur&ue. At this critical juncture, when
every ihing is portentous of "ihange," when we
have an evidence of chmge before Us in the speech
I have just adverted t , it behooves no man from
Georgia to be silent Where are my colleagues'
They are shortly to be my representatives, and
I have a right, as it is my interest, to know their
present position upon all the great questions (parti-
cularly on the tariff question) which have been agi-
tated in this debate I therefore invite them lo
come out—'o speak plainly and openly, and quiet
the hopes and fears, of th>se whose m'erest* are
confided to their hands
Upon toe tar ff question, th/1 people whom I ie'
prisent "arenow where tbey ever hive been, and
where they ever mean to be " If luxuries are to be
taxed let it be done indiscriminately, and if any
change is to be made in our revenue laws, let all
the imports of this country be taxed equally—no
discrimination—no protec ion. If any imports
must be admitted duty free, let the sugar, salt, iron,
mohs e , coarse woollens aDd coarse «htons—the
ab olute necessaries of life, be relieved, and let the
revenue raispd be sufficient only for an economical
administration of the Government With this sort
of a tariff, ami with no other, (notwithstanding
ihe events of th" last summer) will the people of
Georgia be satisfied If they supported General Har-
rison, and inadvertent y brought cer'amot his friends
into power, they assuredly did not d > <o with the re-
motest expectation that a protectee disc  iminatingta
nff,eith*>r open, ord sguuedasatax on luxuries, was
to be fas ened on Ihem Aud when they find that
sucha result is 1 kely to follow "the nents of the
I nl slimmer," anotner 'change ' aia> com > over the
spirit of my co league's dream
Mr CnaFma , I have ro vxin reg.efs for the
past, bm let us look to the future, and watch closely
the shadows whi^h ever precede coming events
Piecaulion is 'he * fec;uaia of our rights and Ubei-
ties, m thi, spirit onl,, as one t f tbe people, and
as a represantative of the reop'e,Uuundti,e alarm.
Jtt doing s0) I have ('one my duty, and come what
may of it, I shall alway, be consoled by the re-
collection that I have suffered no pers->nal feelings
to deter me from my post when I had nought to
face but a victorious and overwhelming enemy.
