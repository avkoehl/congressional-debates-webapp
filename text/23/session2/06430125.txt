THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

mentioned in the report Mr. K read from the
report, page 18 " It is not improbable to suppose"
«that the President would have abstained from
'any such recommendation, if he had known
'what recent intell gence from Prance shows, that,
' in point offset, the Chambers assembled on the
' 1st of December, instead of the 29'h, the day on
' which it was believed by the President they
'would meet "
The ouject of the latter part of the amendment
was also obvious He did not wish to stand com-
muted, or hold out the idea to Trance that we
would, under no circumstances, take any steps
during the present session of Congress, however
we might be justified by future information re-
ceived He was very far from wishing to con-
nect himself or the Senate to any future specific
mode of action, or to any action at all At pres
ent, we agree that legislation was inexpedient
Bjt he was unwilling to commit ourselves to the
inexpediency of legislation at this session, pro-
vided future information, before the adjournment,
should call for legislation upon the subject
Mr CLAY replied that he was glad to see the
honorable member from Georgia animated with
the best spirit on this subject—that he was frank,
ODen, and unreserved, in the expression of his
sentiments, and he was happy to find m his resolu-
tion that there was no ground for serious difficulty
between them But he thought the gentleman's
reso'ution was objectionable in two of its provis
ions The report was an argumentative docu-
ment, and it was not usual in resolutions appended
to such papers, to reiterate the reasoning in the
report His first objection to the resolution was,
that it assigned one of the reasons contained in
the report, iV he adoption of the resolution, and
he thought that not the stiongest one If one of
the reasons m the report might be drawn down,
he thought all might, and each Senator might
require the introduction into the resolution of the
reasons which governed his vote The Trench
Minister had said, in a part of the correspondence,
that a bill would be prepared for the sppiopria-
tion, and submitted to the Chamber the next day,
but the committee came to the conclusion that vve
ought not to reproach them for not doing so,
because they were the most proper judges of what
was the proper time for its presentation, he could
not, therefore, assent to one of the reasons be.ng
introduced into the resolution There was one
other part of the resolution, " that it was mex-
' pedient to act till further information should be
' received fiom France," an expression which he
viewed in the hgnt of a menace, and implied that
if their further action was not of a satisfactory
nature, then we were prepared to resort to the
measure recommended by the President Now,
he (Mr C ) would not say what he would do, if
Fiance should not make the appropriation at the
present session of the Chambers " Sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof " Let us have all the
circumstances before us He was for having Con-
gress free to deliberate upon war, open, undisguised
war—upon commercial res r.ctions or .eprisak,
unfettered in the event of any contingencies He
was anxious for all the circumstances—whetner
the King had abandoned the claim, or intended to
go on pressing it But if we looked fuither, it
would be seen that the propnety of ihis course was
more apparent when we considered that this Con-
gress terminated on the 3d March, when a new
Congress would come m, that they oughtto remain
free when the awful alternative of a rupture or
submission to wiong shall be presented, he, there-
fore, moved to stuke out the parts of the amend-
ment which he liad indicated as objectionable
Mr WEBSTER thought that the importance
of unanimity on this subject was so great, and
the piactical difference between the two resolu-
tions was so email, that pains should be taken to
throw them into a shape that the resolution could
bt adopted The prevailing sentiment seemed to
be a concurrence in the views of the President, of
the na'ure of the controveisy wjth Prance, of the
clear right of tnis country, and the utter impossi-
bility that the councils oi the United States can
depart from the just expectation of a reasonable
fulfilment of the stipulations by France He
thought there did seem to be an objection to the
i onoiable member's amendment, because it placel
the action of the Senate on one of several íeasons,
and left the inference that on other reason's given
in the report, the action of the Senate might be
otherwise It founded the action of the Senate
upon a reason whiJi might cease t > exist to-mor-
row Suppose the Chamber should reject the bill,
and the Executive Government of Trance should,
for that cause, dissolve the Chambers and call a
new one, he did not wish to form an opinion
what the Government of the United States might
do upon such an event occurring It was, there
fore, desirable to leave this Government fieefrom
any indication or intimation of what its action
might be, in any event The sentiment of the
country was, that we were right,and that France
was wrong, and this sentiment was not likely to
be altered
Mr BUCHANAN said he should be exceed-
ingly rejoiced if we could adopt any form of words
which would unite the vote of the Senate on this
occasion He would go as far as any man to make
concessions, in any matte- in which principle was
not involved, for the purpose of presenting our-
selves to the world as a united nation Howevei
we might differ amongst ourselves, as to matters
of internal policy, we ought always to exhibit a
bold and united fiont to foreign nations in defend-
ing the interests and honor of the country He
(Mr B ) felt great pleasure in doing justice to
the frank and conciliatory spirit of the renort of
the Committee on Toreign Relations It was a
statesmanlike production, and worthy of its dis
tmguished author, but, he trust be permitted to
say, that if this were the proper occasion for
such a discussion, he thought he could success
fully controvert several of the positions which it
contained, and show that they were founded in
error He would greatly prefer that the resolu-
tion proposed by the Senator from Georgia [Mr
Ki-re] shou'd stand as he had introduced it It
contained upon its face the reason, and the only
reason which would induce him to yote tor any
resolution of this character It was simple, be
cause the Trench Chambers had been convened
earlier than was expected by tne Pres dent of the
Uni ed States at the commencementof the present
session of Congress, that he wiild give his sup-
port to any such resolution He should, t! erefore,
be gratified if this preamble could be retained
France had, before the close of .he last session of
Congress, communicated to ti-e Piesident, that it
was the unanimous delerrmnation of the King's
Government to appear before the new Legislature
with its treaty and its bill in hand, and that its
intention was to do all that the charter allowed
to habten, as much as possible, the period^of the
pew presentation of the rejected law On the faith
of this assurance, the President rested satisfied,
and did not present the subject to Congress at its
last session How has France redeemed this
pledge> Has that Government hastened, as much
as possible, the piesentation of the rejected law'
At the first meeting of the new Legis'ature, the
liw was not presented, and, fn the face of this
engagement, the Chambers were piorogued, not
to meet in the autumn, as they might have done,
but, on the 29 h ot December, the very latest jay
which custom had sanctioned If this as&uraice
had any meaning at all, ¡t was that the Chambeis
should be convened at least so eauy in the season
as to afford sufiicient time to com"iuri',ate the fact
to the President before the meeting of Congiess
The President, at the date 0' the message, was
not ware that the Cnambeis would assemble on
the first of the month No such imoinauon had
been communicated to him The Trench Gov
erntrent had never informed him sucn was their
intention It now appears thai they did assemble
on that day and, for his own pait, he was willing
to wait until the íesult of their deliberations could
be known What effect th s circumstance might
have produced on the President's determi íation,
he was not prepared to say Every gentleman
could judge for himself He was not possessed
of any information on that sibject
There is a point, said Mr B , in the intercourse
between nations at which diplomacy must end,
and a nation must either consent to abandon her
rights or assert then by force A rter having ne-
gotiated for a quarter of a century, to obtain a
treaty to íedress the wtongs of out injured cm
zens—and aftei the Tienen. Chambei has on e
deliberately rejected that treaty, will noa no po. it
have been reached, should the Chamber again re-
fuse to make the appropriation > If this be bo, is
1' not right, is it not fair, to present this alternative
to France' Would she not have just cause to
complain if we did not adopt this very course >
To inform her fiankly and fairly that we have
arrived at this point, I am solemnly convinced,is
the best diplomacy to which we can resort, to re-
dress the wrongs of the injured claimants France
will then have the alternative distincly presented,
and it will be tor her to deciae whether she will
in vole herself ¡n war with her ancient ally, rather
than pay those claims which the executive branch
of her own Government has determined to be
just, by a so'emn treaty     Such an attitude on the
1 part of the United States will do more to accom-
plish the execution of the treaty than any tempo-
rizing policy which we can aaopt I never was
more clearly convinced of the truth of any propo-
sition
Fiance, from the tone and language of the Pres-
ident, wi 1 have no ngnt to consider this a menace.
It is no moie than to say, diplomacy has ended,
I and the treaty must be executed, or we shall,
J however reluctantly, be compelled to take redress *
into our own hands We cannot, we dare not,
abandon the just rights of our own citizens, how-
ever painful it may be for us to assert them France
is a brave and a chivalrous nation, her whole
history" proves that she is not to be intimidated,
even by Europe in arms But France is wise as
well as warlike To inform her that our rights
must be asserted, is to place her in the serious and
solemn position of deciding whethei she will, for
I the sake of a few millions of francs, more or less,
resist the payment of a just debt by force When
ever she is convinced that this result is inevitable,
the money will be paid, and although I hope I
may be mistaken, I believe it will never be paid
before France has never appeared to iegard the
quection in this serious light
It has been asked what would the American
Congress do, placed in similar circumstances'
Would they appropriate the money with a menace
impending over their heads ' I answer no, never
But it would be no menace, if, after Congress had
twice refused to vote an appropriation to cany a
treaty into effect, a foreign Governire.it, in the
spirit of candor, in language mild and courteous,
such as that used by the President, were to mferm
us they could not abandon their rights, and,
1 however painful it might be, they should be com-
pelled, by a sense of duty, to  assert them by
J force
1     Mr B concluded by saying he felt it due to
I himself thus to explain the vote which hem ended
, to give
Mr   CUTHBERT said he had not ansen to
I enter .rto any exposit on of his opinions on this
subject, but simply to suggest that such pnrase-
' ology might be used ai> should unite the votes of
every ho lorable Senator now separated only by a
1 slight shade of diff"ienee Mr O read the reso
lution. and said, it it was so worded as to express
that, "under ex ..ting circumstances,'' or, 'the
state of ciroumsiances now existing," it might
meet the views of all parties, and enable the Sen-
ate to pass its unanimous vo e upon the subject.
Mr KING, of Alabama, congra'ulated .he Sen-
| ate upon the spirit and temper which appeared on
both sides, and said he was one of those who was
not in favoi of taking up this question at the
present time, but the report having been made, it
became necessary to act upon it He wished for
mere infotmation before any discussion should
have arisen, and thus he was rot preDaied to say
expressly what ought to be done, or what the
Congress of the Uri.ed S'ates shou11 do What
he desired now, was, as far as pricticable, to ex-
press an opinion in language that could not be
misunderstood, ei her in this coun ry or on tne
other side of tne Atlantic, of oai deteimination
Mr K had hoped that ni  honoiablefi lend from
Georgia vvou'd have yielded in the spirit of con-
cession, ana that the) mignt vote expl city on the
ground that at this time it was inexpedient to pass
any act upon the subject Mr K also expressed
a ho,>e that every gemleu.un would feel rimself
justified in vo'ingfoi the pioposed measure, so
that it might g-1 f< rth to the wo-ld as the unani- >
rajuj voice of that body
