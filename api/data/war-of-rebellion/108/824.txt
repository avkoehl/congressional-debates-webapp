EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Richmond, Va., February 29, 1864.

His Excellency Z. B. VANCE,

Raleigh, N. C.:

SIR: Your letter of the 9th instant was received on the 13th, but the close of the Congressional session imposed on me duties too engrossing to permit a prompt reply.

I therefore deem it a duty to respond. When you assert that there has been "what seemed a studied exclusion of the antisecessionists from all the more important offices of the Government, even from those promotins in the army which many of them had won with their blood," I c\am compelled to characterize the statement as unjust to my conduct, my feelings, and my character. You cannot expect me to receive such a charge from the Governor of a State without insisting on a specification.

If unable to maintain this assertion, I leave to your own sense of justice to determine how best to repair the wrong done. In the meantime I assert that there exists
