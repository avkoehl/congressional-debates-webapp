men to deal with whom they believe to be upright-hearted, to put them to trouble on account of scruples of conscience is a painful task, and likely to be avoided as much as easily may be. But where men profess to be so meek and heavenly-minded and to have their trust so firmly settled in God that they cannot join in wars, and yet by their spirit and conduct in common life manifest a contrary disposition, their difficulties are great at such a time. Officers, who in great anxiety are endeavoring to get troops to answer the demands of their superiors, seeing men who are insincere pretend a scruple of conscience in hopes of being excuse from a dangerous employment, are likely to handle them roughly. In this time of commotion some of our young men left the parts and tarried abroad till it was over; some came and proposed to go as soldiers; others appeared to have a real tender scruple in their mind against joining in wars, and were much humbled under the apprehension of a trial so near. I had conversation with several of these to my satisfaction. At the set time when the captain came to town, some of those last mentioned went and told him, in substance, as follows: That they could not bear arms for conscience sake; nor could they hire any to go in their places, being resigned as to the event of it. At length the captain acquainted them all that they might return home for the present, and required them to provide themselves as soldiers and to be in readiness to march when called upon. This was such a time as I had not seen before, and yet I may say, with thankfulness to the Lord, that I believed this trial was intended for our good, and I was favored with resignation to Him."
