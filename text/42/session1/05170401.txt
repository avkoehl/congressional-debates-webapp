1871.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
401
What is the remedy for all this? Think you
that your armies and your navies will restore
prostrate industries and give life to a dying
public credit? Do you believe that they will
strengthen that deserved affection for govern-
ment, which is truly named loyalty and in
which Governments secure their cheap defense,
and on which they may rest in imperturbable
repose? What is the true remedy ? Remofe
at once political disabilities from the best and
most influential men of the South who are now
alone subject to them. Leave the southern
people to manage their own affairs under and
in obedience to our written Constitution. Then
the southern office-holder, instead of running
here to seek the means for holding his posi-
tion, will endeavor to retain it by making him-
self acceptable to the people whose agent he
is. You have made the negro a voter. For-
bear trying to reverse the order of things by
insisting that he shall be the ruler. Let the
experiment of his enfranchisement be tried,
and tried fairly.
So far as I speak for my party, we do not
propose to put a straw in the way of your ex-
periment. It may be, as has been predicted,
that the negro, being a voter, politicians on
both sides will court and flatter him to get his
suffrage. So be it. If in this way the colored
man finds security and is made more useful as
a citizen, I have no fault to find. I, for one,
have no fears of what is called the negro vote.
If the black man is fitted to be a voter, he will
vote to sustain the principles I advocate, if
my principles are right. If he wants cheap
salt, as I do, if he wants cheap coal, as I do,
if he wants cheap iron, as I do, if he wants
corruption to cease here, as I do, if he wants
an economic administration of the Govern-
ment, as I do, in a word, if he wants to make
it easier for those who live by honest labor to
make a living, as I do, he will vote with me.
If not, he may vote with the honorable gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kelley,] but
he will not if he is fitted to vote at all.
What, then, is the remedy for the troubles
we are considering? You have tried repres-
sive and coercive legislation, and you say the
condition of the South is becoming worse.
Abandon it. Return to the practice and the
principles of your fathers. Have faith in the
people. Let them manage their own concerns.
Proclaim to the South, not martial law, but
ratify in its interest and in your own the axioms
once dear to every American heart: the right
of the people to regulate their own concerns;
the right of a community to manage its own
affairs; the right of the States to sweep unchal-
lenged in their independent spheres ; supreme
over all the Federal authority, oppressing
none, protecting all, and inspiring by its benefi-
cence the love of all.
Mr. ROOSEVELT. I move that the House
do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at eleven o'clock and fifty-five minutes a. m.,
Monday, April 3, 1871) the House adjourned.
