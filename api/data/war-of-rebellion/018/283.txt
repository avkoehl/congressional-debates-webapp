HEADQUARTERS,Manassas, May 29, 1862.

Brigadier General G. D. BAYARD:

General McDowell wishes to have your command at Front Royal as soon as is consistent with the welfare of your horses. Can you march to-night, taking your artillery with you, and sending the Rifle battalion by rail? Forage will be up in an hour. He wishes to keep your horses in good condition, so that they will be serviceable when they arrive. Answer, with particulars.

SAML. BRECK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CATLETT'S STATION, May 29, 1862.

Major BRECK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

If absolutely indispensable I will move, but the Pennsylvania regiment can go to-night, if they have a good feed, as far as Hay Market without injury. But I think it would be best to allow the Jersey horses a night's rest. I can go with the battery and Pennsylvania regiment, and Jersey regiment will follow in the morning.
