SAINT LOUIS, August 13, 1861.

Colonel LAUMAN [Seventh Iowa]:

SIR: You are hereby ordered to proceed by railroad forthwith to Rolla, to re-enforce and support Brigadier-General Sigel, with five other regiments ordered there. As it is apprehended that the rebels under Hardee will threaten Rolla from Salem, and endeavor to cut off General Sigel's communication with Saint Louis, that place (Rolla) is to be held at all hazards.

The command will be assumed by the senior colonel, who will report at once to this department.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

[The same, mutatis mutandis, to the colonels of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Illinois and Second and Seventh Missouri Regiments of Infantry.]

Honorable MONTGOMERY BLAIR, Washington City:

See instantly my dispatch to the Secretary of War. My judgment is that some regiments with arms in their hands, and some field artillery ready for use, with arms and ammunition, ought to be expressed to this point. The report of the action comes from General Lyon's aide, Major Farrar. If true, you have no time to loss.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Captain JOHN C. KELTON,

Asst. Adjt. General, U. S. Army, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I have reliable evidence that about 3,000 troops, mostly mounted, but badly armed, staid near Fredericktown last night, and expressed the intention of moving to-day toward Farmington, with the intention of coming in and destroying the railroad. At the same time it is very reliable that 5,000 well-armed men, under General Hardee, are advancing upon this place. I express you the facts, and leave it to the general commanding whether in his judgment more troops should not be sent. I have to report at the same time that 32-pounder iron pieces sent here are not yet mounted, and I fear cannot be to-morrow. Could a battery of field artillery and one regiment of infantry be sent here to-morrow
