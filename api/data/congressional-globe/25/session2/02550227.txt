doubt that his colleague had intended to be a straight forward
man 10 ta political course, and lie thought it likely he had con
vlnced himself that he had been so He, too, had intended to
be a straight forwaid politician, to govern himself by certain
fixed principles, and to cany them out m all his actions, but he
dare not say lor himself what his colleague claimed, that he
had been straight upon all occasions One of them must have
turned the angle 01 the cm ve, as they were verj recently toge
thei, pursuing the name course, and entertaining the same opi
nions, and now they seemed to him to be very neaily oppositos
in opinion an 1 action Undei these cucumstances, be much pre
ferred to leave to their common constituents the decision of the
question, which had turned and which had kept " straight foi
ward "
He thought he had kept s'raight forward, but lie was aware
that a man lost, wh n intending to pursue a stialght Une, would
almost invariably describe a circle It was evident that eithei
himself 01 his honorable colleague were now, and had been for
some months past, lost, and that one of them had gotjust about
half round the circle, and so fai as he was concerned, then con
stituents, and not themselves, should settle the question which
was thelost politician
In jus ice to himself, however, he must claim that he had
some mirks, some guide-posts to direct his way and determine
his course He came into this bod} the friend of the late Admi
nisliation, of its principles, and ot its measuies He was se
lectedby those who sent him here, beciuse such weie known to
be hito feeling* and opinions ¡finding no cause to change
ei'hei, he had lemaincd the friend and supportei of that Admi
mstsation during us continuance, and dunng the whole of the
period he found the talented and distinguished body of Opposi
tion Senators upon his light unifoiraly opposed to him A
change of Admimstiation came, and he contributed his humble
effotts to place at its head the piesent President He had long
known that individual, and they had long been peisonal and
political fuends He, therefore became a supporter of his
administration, and still remained so He was daily told by the
Opposition Senators that the present Administration was but
carrying out the punciples and measures of the last, and elabo
rate speeches had been recently made, and weie now daily
making, to prove, not only to the Senate, but to the counuy,
that this was the fact Could he, then, be inconsistent in sup
porting this, an he had done the last, Administiationi But,
again, ¡he found the same distinguished Senatois who had
during the whole eight years led the opposition m the political
warfare against the late Adminisfiatioti, equally leadeis in op
position to this They occupy the same seats and use precisely
t-he same weapons in the fight Upon all questions they met
him, as formerly, in open md poweiful opposition If then,
he had been lost and tia\ellmg the circle, so necessaniy must
they have been upon ihewhiil, loo foi the distant e between
them and himself lemamed piecisety the ^aine Ihcy weie
exactly opposite at the stai t, and they wei e exat tly oppo i e
now, not hadtheie been any aimisticc within whlehthoy could
have met and ciossed eich other And, again he new found
himseh sunounded by, anil acting with, almost all (he was
sorry he could not say all) of those who had evei been political
friends They too, therefoie, had been lost if he had been, and
yet continued to puisue the eouise with him, whether dueet 01
circular These considerations would certainly not only pal
hate his error, if he was in enor, but would furnish him some
apology for being somewhat confident that his was not the en
cular course
A single woidas toaiemarkof the honorable Senator from
Massachusetts, and he had done That Senator had said that
m 1834, he had no confidence m the system of ^tate b tnk de
posites, but that I had, and that time has shown that opinions
upon that subject were then light and that mine were. \vi ong
I had then confidence in that system, and I expressed it freely,
fully, and honestly The trial of the system was made, and m
less than four years, and that too durmg a peuod ot the most
abundant plenty and prosperity, it iailed This expeuence
destroyed my confidence, and convinced me thit the system was
bad both foi the public and the banks I cannot, by volition,
íestore that confidence I cannot believe that to be good, md
safe, and beneficial, which has been pro\ ed bcfoi e my own eyes,
tobad, and dangerous, and miunous Has this expel mice
change 1 the former opinions ot the Senator No He tells us
this day that he has no confidence in the Sute bank deposite
system Still this is the system which my honoiable colleague
urges upon us, and desires us to loree upon the cotmtiy,
against the íecent and positive expeuence ofevtiy business
man m it I, foi one, cannot bring myself to such acouise of
action
Mi TALLMADGE made a brief leply to Mr Wwght
Whatevei might have been then devious political wireline,
there was no hostile feeling between his colleague and himself
With legaid to the course which his colleague had puisued, he
had been guided by the Executive index, as that had pointed in
its revolutions aiound the pol tied circle, so followed his eol
league, and he must take care, said Mi T lest in his wandei
mg, he should be lost like the twelve tribes mthedeseit If the
Executive ha J been a fixed sldl, all might have been well with
his cnlh ague hut msteal of that he was, to all intents an 1
purpose  anerranc comet, and wherever the light of his tail
appeared, there was to be found his colleague, directing his
course m pursuit

On motion of Mr FULTON', the lomt lesolution fioni the
House providing for the taking down of the walls of the burnt
postjoflice, was earned through the different stages, and passed
INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
Independent Treasury bill as the special order, the
question being on Mr Bicha van's motion of yes-
teiday, to postpone the bill and amendment till the
next session of Congress.
Mr CALHOUN could scarcely persuade him-
self that there was any hazard in taking this vote.
It appeared to him to be the best measure lor the
relief of the country, and he could rot believe in
the correctness of the views of the gentleman from
Massachusetts, that any postponement now would
be construed by the country as a decision of the
great financial question before them The country
had been greatly agitated, and until there was a
decision on this question, he did not believe that
the mercantile community could be restoied to
their former prosperity. He solemnly believed
that if this question had been settled at the extra
session, that the commercial interest would hive
been relieved from the piessure so much com-
plained of, and that those wno now resist it will
incur a heavy responsibility by so doing lie
could not believe that there was any hazaid in
taking this vote, noi that th s Congress would rise,
without deciding a question so important to the
best interests of the whole country An affii¿na-
tive vote on thi^ motion would ha/e all the ePect
of a rejection of the bill, and those, therefore, who
were opposed to the bill in any shape, ■would vote
for the postponement They could not do more
than decide lhe question for this session, foi it un-
doubtedly, if postponed, would be renewed at the
next
Mr MORRIS observed, that, at the commence
ment ot this debate, he did not intend to utter a sin-
gle word on ihis subject, nor did he intend now to
assign any reasons tor or against the bi'l He
rose to correct a misunderstanding as to the effect
of his vote on this motion He should vote against
the posiponement, and if that motion failed, he
should vote against the substitute of the gentleman
from Virginia. He should then vote for ceitam
amendments which he deemed indispensable to ren-
der this bill acceptable to him, and if these failed
he should be compelled to vote against the bill
He, theiefore, did not wish the vote he now gave to
be considered as Dindmg him to any future vote
If certain amendments, which he siould suggest at
the proper time, should be adopted, he would vote
for the bill, otherwise he should vote against it
The question was then taken on Ml BUCHA-
NAN'S motion to postpone the bill and amend-
ments till the next session, and lost—yeas 23, nats

Mr PRESTON desired to know whether it was
m order, at this stage of the proceedings, to offer
an amendment to the substitute proposed by Mr
Rives?   On being answered m the affirmative,
Mr. PRESTON commenced in too low a tone of
voice to be distinctly audible to the reportei, but
he was understood to say that he was in favor of
the substitute, provided it could be amended with
certain improvements. He objected, aKo, that any
preject oí this kind, to be saioly catned throueh,
must be wisely administered by the Executive De-
partments oi the Government, and he must say
that he had no confidence m the ability of tne offi-
cer who was to carry it on, and who seemed to have
no liking but for the most mid and visionary
schemes. It is a nice question ot patriotism, said
Mr P whether we ought not to stand by and ste
this measure carried through, because it is a mea-
sure of the Administration—whether it would not
be better to give them this measure, and let them
carry it out, and make the most oí it, and thus let
the failure which must ensue, rouse the indigna-
tion of the country against the experiment and ex-
penmenters, or, by a vigorous resistance, defeat it.
He believed that the experiment would derange the
commerce of the country, and derange the cur-
rency to an unexampled degree. But though he
believed all this, he was not sure that this measure
would not, in the end, be better than any, eyea the
wisest measure, entrusted to this Administration,
which had heretofore administered trie wisest laws
so mjunously. He did not know whether it would
not be better to give them [the Administration] this
law, rather than let them go on and canvass with it,
to advance their Democratic, agrarian and loco foco
measures. Give it to them, said Mr P and take
these catch words of rag barons, shin-plasters, and
uredeemable currency, from their mouths, wi'h
vi hich they continue to agitate the country
It was known to every man who had a bank
note, and who had a debt to pay, that the Sub-
Treasury system was now m full operation; and all
they want, said Mr. P is for us to legalize what
they now already have Mr P here complained
of indisposition, and regretted that he had not the
ability to go on in full He would have been glad
to show how destruclive this measure would be to
the prosperity of the country, and, as a southern
man, to show his disapprobation of a measure cal-
culated to break down the agricultural States, and
make them subservient to a central power. He
was anxious to show that its effects would be to
cripple our commerce, and, by a reduction of this
revenue, produce an increase of the tariff, and, as
a State rights man, "born in the purple," "porphy-
rogemtus," he was anxious to vindicate the straight-
foi ward principles in which he had been nurtured,
and show that it was impossible for him to support
a measure so directly at variance with them. If a
suitable opportunity occurred, he should do so; but
for the present he should content himself with
offering some amendments to the substitute, with
tho necessary explanations.
The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Rives] had
proposed that a system of financial agencies should
be carried out through the medium of the State
btnks, and he would be glad to see such a system
carried out, but a manifest objection to this vtas,
the patronage which it conferred on the Executive.
He had always been opposed to the union of the
purse and the sword, and, if he had no other ob-
jection to the Sub-Treasury scheme, this would be
a sufficient one The same objection applied to the
scheme of the gentleman from Virginia, and, to
remove that, he proposed to offer this amendment.
It would be recollected that the banks to be se-
lected as public depositories, were to be selected at
the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Now he proposed that this selection should be by
general principles, to be established by Congress
His first amendment, therefore, proposed that the
public deposilones shall be selected from such
banks whose stock is owned m whole or m part by
the ¡slates in which they are situated and he was
happy to be able to say that in almost every State
of the Union, there were, at the points where it
was necessity for the Government to have finan-
cial agents, banks, whose stock was owned either
m whole or in part by the States in which they
were But if it should turn out that there were
none such, then he would confide the selection to
the States themselves, and the amendment proposed
that it should be made by the Legislatures, when m
session, and by the Go/ernois in the íecess. We
hat e already decided, Mi. P. said, that the sur-
plus public money shall be put in deposite wiih the
State-, and the very institution^ in which the States
have deposited this surplus, will most probably be
selected In the other case, the selection will be
given to the Secietary of the Treasury, but m this
proposition, this immense source of patronage and
influence will be cut off. He should also propose
an amendment to reverse, in some sort, the order
of that part of the proposition of the gentleman
from Virginia, in regard to the mode by which he
addtessed himself to the banks, to induce thtm to
resume specie payments He should propose that
the notes of all the banks in Jhe country that are, m
the estimation of the Secretaiy of the Treasury,
sound, safe, and substantial, be taken for the dues
of the Government, up to a certain day, say the
first of August next, after which, none are to he
taken but the notes of specie-paymg banks. By
these means, the Government would lend a help-
ing hand to those banks which are not able to re-
sume without its aid.
He had another amendment to offer which h«
would briefly notice.     It had been supposed that
