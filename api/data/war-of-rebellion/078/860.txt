PALMETTO, September 21, 1864.

General B. BRAGG, Richmond, Va.:

I have ordered the iron removed from the Macon and Atlanta Railroad above Griffin, and from the Augusta road all above Oconee River. It would be better for us if there were no railroad from Atlanta to Augusta. Would it not be well to remove the iron from a point even farther south than this on the Augusta road? The army very much inspirited by our move in this direction.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

PALMETTO, September 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General, Richmond:

This army is very much in need of shoes; its operations render it absolutely necessary that they should be furnished at once. Dillard, at Columbus, can furnish 5,000 pairs on your order. Please give it.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

PALMETTO, September 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General, Richmond"

Major Ayer has reported for assignment of chief quartermaster. I have not assigned him, as an assignment merely temporary would seriously embarrass the army, and would be unjust to him in view of the great responsibility. Please telegraph whether assignment will be permanent; if so, I will assign him.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF TENNESSEE, Numbers 23. In the Field, September 21, 1864.

I. The commanding general calls attention to the fact that it is the duty of all officers and men to secure to the citizen the unmolested enjoyment of his property, and to discountenance and endeavor to bring to deserved punishment those who cause suffering and distress to citizens by acts of depredation and wanton destruction. It should be the proud aim of the soldier to reward the generosity and patriotism of our citizens by respecting their private rights, and to preserve the admiration and esteem of his countrymen by refraining from the commission of those acts that justly render him a disgrace to the service and a menace to the peace and security of families.
