Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Fort Leavenworth:

Your telegram of the 17th instant was received this morning. The list of colonels and brevet brigadier-general required I will forward as soon as possible. The troops You are sending me will be amply sufficient for this district. Lieutenant R. W. Jenkins, Company I, Second Colorado Cavalry, in his fight with the Indians between Cow Creek and Fort Zarah punished them severely. He found thirteen dead warriors besides those carried off by the Indians on the field, recaptured a lot of stock, also captured buffalo robes, blankets, arms, and camp equipage, without losing a man and having but two wounded. Lieutenant Jenkins is entitled to great credit for his perseverance and energy.
