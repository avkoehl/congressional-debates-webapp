HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleson, S. C., March 30, 1864.

Brigadier General GID. J. PILLOW,

Commanding, & c., Montgomery, Ala.,:

GENERAL: Your application of the 24th instant for several companies of cavalry from Florida has been referred to Major General Patton Anderson, commanding that district, for his remarks, but I think his answer will be that he has not enough cavalry or other troops for his present wants, for he is now confronting the enemy at Jacksonville and Palatka. I am unable to send him re-enforcements from the other districts of the department, as I have lately received an order to send several regiments of cavalry to Virginia, which will very much weaken me in South Carolina and Georgia.

I thank you for your compliments relating to our success in this department. I am compelled in self-defense to defeat the enemy, otherwise I would be ruined at home.

Wishing you success in your new sphere of operations, I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
