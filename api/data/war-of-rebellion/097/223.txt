By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 28, 1865.

In sending dispatches to corps commanders after starting to-morrow, I consider it necessary to number each dispatch to a corps commander and to state by whom sent or whether sent by telegraph. This will be done, and corps commanders are requested to do the same with their dispatches. Hatcher's Run becomes Rowanty Creek below its junction with Gravelly Run. Let reveille be as usual, not at the hour of march, or increased, but as sounded under ordinary circumstances. General Warren has kindly furnished these suggestions, and I adopt them.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(To corps commanders.)

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 28, 1865.

In the contemplated movement corps commissaries will remain habitually at the headquarters of their corps. Division commissaries will always accompany ad be preset with their trains. Brigade commissaries, when not actually engaged in making issues of supplies, will be present with the headquarters of their brigades.

By command of Major-General Meade:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
