road parallel to their line of march was taken by my command, and the head of the column will rest near Taylorsville to-night. A smll party was sent to discover his positon. Should he a ttack Richmond I will certainly move [in] his rear and do what I can; at the same time, I hope to be able to strike him if he endeavors to escape. His force is large, andif attack is made on Richmond it will be pricipally as dismounted cavalry, which fight better than enemy'zs infantry. Genreal Bragg will please have this repeated to Geenal lee.

HANOVER JUNCTION, May 10, 1864 - 1 p. m.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

As far as I can ascertain the force of the enemya dvancinfg toward Richmond consists of their cavalry corps under Sheridan. The corps is composed of the ree divisions. They left Beaver Dam last night and encamped on North Anna River, on road to Chilesburg. This mornign they returned to Beaver Dam. The head of their column left that place, marching in direction of Richmond, at 6 o'cloxck this morning. I am now on Central road, one mile and a half bedlow Beaver Dam. The enemy have obsturcted their route by felling trees, &amp; c., and if I find my progress too much delayed by following their trail, I will strike over to Hanover junction and arrive htere at 5 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

The enemy's cavalry moved from Trinity Church, on Negro Foot road, in the dire3ction of Ahland. Finding the road in their rear so much obstructed, I turned off at the forks of Hanover Court- Huse and Negro Foot road and am marching for the junctin. I suggest Tunstall's and Old CXhurc as points to be occupied to prevent their escape.

General BRAXTON BRAGGG,

Richmond, Va.:

I am informed by a reliable citizen the head oft e enemy's cavalry column was at Ground Squirrel Bridge, on what is called the Richmond road, at 4.15 p. m. There is none of our cavalry from thisz direction between the enemy and Richmond. Has the enemy made any demonstration upon Richmond! Please answer to- night, if practicable, as I am very anxius to give my command a night's rest, if compatible with duty.
