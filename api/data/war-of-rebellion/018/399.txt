HEADQUARTERS,Mount Jackson, June 16, 1862.

The PRESIDENT:

Your dispatch received. About the correctness of General Fremont's report there can be no question. When he attacked Jackson at Cross Keys the co-operation of General Shields was expected-Jackson being immediately between them-when Shields withdrew and Jackson was largely re-enforced. The conditions were no longer the same, and it was in reference to this new state of things that my letter was written. As to Shields, I wrote on the information I had. More by letter.
