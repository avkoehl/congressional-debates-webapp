HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., June 29, 1865.

GENERAL: My last general report of operations, dated at Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 8 [1], 1865,* completed the history of the Cavalry Corps, Military Division of the Mississippi, from its organization to that date. In pursuance of instructions from General Thomas, I was authorized, after the escape of Hood to the south side of the Tennessee River, to assemble the available force of the corps in the vicinity of Eastport, at the head of steam-boat navigation on the Tennessee River, for the purpose of compelling the organization and putting the troops in the best possible condition for early active operations. By his direction, after transferring the Seventh Ohio and Fifth Iowa from the Sixth Division, it was ordered to Pulaski with a view to its remaining in Tennessee for local operations. No reports have since been received of its services. On the 24th of January La Grange's and Watkins' brigades, of the First Division, after a fatiguing march arrived at Waterloo Landing, in the northwestern corner of Alabama. They had been detained in Kentucky under General McCook for the purpose of ridding that State of a band of rebel cavalry under Lyon. In pursuance of previous orders, the Third Brigade of this division was then distributed between the First and Second Brigades. Brevet Brigadier-General Watkins, at his own request, was ordered to Nashville to report to Brigadier General R. W. Johnson, commanding the Sixth Division, for assignment to the command of a brigade in that division. About the same time the Second Division, Brigadier General Eli Long commanding, and newly mounted and equipped, arrived from Louisville, having marched from that place, a distance of 385 miles, in midwinter over bad roads, with scanty supplies of forage, in twenty-eight days. Soon after this Winslow's brigade, of the Fourth Division, arrived by steam transports from the same place. The Second Brigade of this division was then organized by joining the First Ohio (transferred from the Second Division) with the Fifth Iowa and the Seventh Ohio (transferred from the Sixth Division). Bvt. Brigadier General A. J. Alexander, a young officer of courage and administrative ability, was assigned to the command. Brigadier General B. H. Grierson had been originally assigned to the command of this General B. H. Grierson had been originally assigned to the command of this for the field, he was replaced by Bvt. Major General E. Upton, an officer of rare merit and experience. The troops were all cantoned on the north bank of the Tennessee River, Long's, Upton's, and Hatch's divisions and Hammond's brigade, of Knipe's division, at Gravelly Springs, and McCook's division at Waterloo. The aggregate force was about 22,000 men, 13,000 of whom were armed with Spencer carbines and rifles, feed, and attention to become fit for active service. The balance were poorly armed and dismounted.

On the 3rd of February I received instructions to send a division of 5,000 cavalry to General Canby. After consultation with General Thomas it was decided to send Knipe's division; but in order to furnish it with horses it was found necessary to dismount a part of the command remaining behind. General Hatch's division, composed of most excellent troops, had under its gallant commander won great distinction during the recent campaign, but having the largest number of dismounted men, and having been constantly in service from the beginning of the war, I thought it best to take the horses from it necessary to mount the troops about to leave. I wished to give it an opportunity to
