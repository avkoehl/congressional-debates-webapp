GENERAL: General Sherman's instructions have been received. Major Jennigns has arrived. I am pushing a reconnaissance toward Powder Springs and Dalton and Villa Rica. The creek is very high; cannot be forded. My bridge, I think, will stand.

J. KILLPATRICK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry DIVISION.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., October 2, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

There is a flood in the Chattahoochee, which has damaged our railroad bridge, and will, of course, early away any of Hood's bridges. I want that reconnaissance pushed out boldly. As soon as it reaches Fairburn let me know, as I may push it on to the rear of their bridge. All the valuable part of the enemy's cavalry is over beyond Sweet Water, and we can do them damage on this side now. The same cause which produced the rise in the Chattahoochee will affect the Tennessee, and Forrest will be in danger with a swollen river to his rear.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,October 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch received. I have sent word to General Ransom to report to me as soon as he arrives at Fairburn, and not to hasten his march back unless compelled to.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
