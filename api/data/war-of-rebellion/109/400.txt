Brigadier-General WILLCOX:

My provost-marshal reports that a prisoner, an old acquaintace of his, informs him that Morgan proposes to cross the river to-day below Madison at Cooper's Bar. A negro, a freeman captured by Morgan, also an acquaintance of the provost-marshal, confirms the prisoner's statement.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

General WALLACE,

North Vernon:

Dispatch received. General Hughes was about leaving Seymour for North Vernon this morning. Must be there about this time. Please direct him to keep his mounted men well out, and communicate with me constantly and as readily as possible. If Morgan has gone to Maddison, even with his whole force, you will have troops enough without Hughes at Madison. Please order Hughes to keep his infantry ready to move on the cars at either Seymour or North Vernon and send out all the mounted force he has or can collect. Both harass Morgan and bring in information. Will you please communicate as repeatedly as possible with me concerning the whereabouts of Morgan from time to time. Shall hold troops here ready to take the cars for Lawrenceburg, and boats are now waiting there to transport the troops along the river above Madison. Boyle will look out for him should he attempt to cross below Madison. Let us bag the scoundrels without fail.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
