for they year? Refer to my letter of June 13, and answer by telegraph if You need any more, how many, and at what point. Stores referred to in that letter are en route. Have You sent in any estimates under that order?

FORT LARAMIE, DAK. TER., July 28, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Department of the Missouri, Fort Leavenworth:

I am rejoiced. I will require in Utah, in addition to amount stated in Your letter of June 13, clothing for 2,500 cavalry and 500 infantry (see my telegrams of June 22 and 27), and subsistence stores for 2,000 men. Have the infantry regiment started? What regiments of cavalry have started this mouth, or are to start this month?

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 28, 1865.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR, Forth Laramie:

Subsistence stores and quartermaster's stores for 5,000 men have been order and mostly gone forward to Salt Lake. The infantry regiment that goes to You is off. The brigade of infantry has been gone eight days. Roads are almost impassable from here to Kearny, and they will be slow in getting trough. The infantry that goes to Salt Lake I think should be the U. S. Volunteers, as I am satisfied the Government will muster out of service the veteran volunteers that are now going on the plains as soon as Indian troubles are over.

Major-General.

FORT LARAMIE, DAK. TER., July 28, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Department of the Missouri, Fort Leavenworth:

If clothing for 5,000 men has gone to Utah it is all I will require. The term of service of Third U. S. Volunteers expires this fall. It is worth while to send them to Utah? Will they be retained? Are Tibbit's and the infantry brigades veteran?
