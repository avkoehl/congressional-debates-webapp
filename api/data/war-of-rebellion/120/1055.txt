Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HOLT,

Judge-Advocate-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., October 28, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit a report of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done under the several cartels of exchange affecting this command which have been made during the present year.

Under a cartel between Major-Generals Franklin, U. S. Army, and Taylor, C. S. Army, in December, 1863, prisoners in the hands of General Taylor, in excess of those held by General Franklin, equivalent to 561 privates, were delivered on parole to General Franklin, whose agreement that an equivalent should be delivered in exchange for them from the first prisoners which should be taken from the forces of General Taylor, was ratified by Major-General Banks in the cartel of January 4, 1864.

The first delivery of prisoners made by me was inn pursuance of this agreement, beginning with which the following is a detailed statement of the several deliveries and exchanges effected by me.

The number of prisoners made by me was in pursuance of this agreement, beginning with which the following is a detailed statement of the several deliveries and exchanges effected by me.

The number of prisoners in each case is stated in its equivalent in privates, according to the cartel of 1862:

The cartel of January 4, 1864, made by myself on the part of Major-General Banks, and Major William M. Levy on the part of Major General R. Taylor, has thus been fully carried into effect, with the exception of the provision for the exchange of the officers and men of the C. S. Army captured at Fort Butler (Donaldsonville, La.) in June, 1863. These prisoners had been sent to the North, and application was long since made by Major-General Banks to the Secretary of War for their return
