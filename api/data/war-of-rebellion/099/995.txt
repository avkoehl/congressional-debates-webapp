HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Grahamville, S. C., January 6, 1865--4 p. m.

Lieutenant M. G. HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

Our pickets last evening (or a scout from them) reported to have met the enemy three miles this side of New River bridge, and fell back in front of the enemy to Hennessy's Cross-Roads, six miles this side of the bridge, where they last saw the enemy at 6 o'clock. Our picket after dark retired three miles farther to the junction of the road from this place with the Savannah and Charleston road, and remained all night. At daylight they advanced again and have not reported since. The officer in charge, Lieutenant Tinsley, of Shaw's battalion, is a good officer, and I can't account for his not sending a courier. Colonel McLemore sent a courier to him, who went to where he had remained last night, but no farther. I have since sent another scout, with orders to go until they find the enemy, and to report what they are doing. We have a line of pickets on the Charleston and Savannah road, from where they are up to Dawson's Bluff.

Very respectfully,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Grahamville, S. C., January 6, 1865.

Lieutenant M. G. HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

We have pickets at the following places, viz: Dawson's Bluff, which is two miles below Coosawhatchie Station, and the troops at Coosawhatchie join my left there, fifty of the Georgia Reserves being there, and one piece of artillery (the gunners, however, have abandoned it); Bee's Creek and Landing (lower road); spring house; Huger's woods; Euhaw breast-works; Tripp's gate; Boyd's Landing road (enemy are at Boyd's house); White Hall; Bolon's Church; brick-yard and Hazzard's Creek; Savannah Hill; Gennesis Landing road; head of Fording Island road; Hardeeville road; making fifty-eight men as advance pickets besides reserve.

The line upon the old Savannah and Charleston road extends upon and near that road from Dawson's Bluff two miles this side of Coosawhatchie, to within six miles of New River bridge. The enemy's gunboats are in front of Bee Creek Landing, and are also at Boyd's Neck, with a small force on land. At Dawson's Bluff the enemy have a battery across the river that dismounted one of our guns the day we came here. There are two guns of artillery at Bee's Creek, one at Honey Hill (near here), and one at Glover's place, four miles below. The Thirteenth Tennessee is at Honey Hill, Fourth at Glover's, Kentucky Brigade at Bee's Creek, fifty of the Fourth at Dawson's Bluff, and Shaw's battalion here. I would like to show Major-General Wheeler the lines to-morrow if he desires to see them.

Very respectfully,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, Commanding.

I have no pickets at Wilkins', Seabrook's or Bolon's house, nor upon the Okota River. I do not know where Rover Creek is. I located my pickets where General Young's were, after consulting with him and Colonel Colcock.
