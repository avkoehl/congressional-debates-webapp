idea of the faithful services of the men and officers of the brigade. For many days it rained hard, and at other times the weather has been oppressively hot. The enemy, though not strong, has been vigilant, and required constant watchfulness on our part; but all duties have been met, and the spirit of all is as good to- day for service as when we left camp. Our horses have had for the most part enough forage, and had it not been for the heat and some long marches, would have suffered little. The horses of the battery have suffered most, as the toil they have had to undergo has been greater than animals can stand, with no other forage than green corn, at this season. A tabular statement accompanies this as required. The number of miles marched direct is 215; adding the many scouts, independent expeditions, patrols, &amp;c., not enumerated, and the command may be said to have marched at least 250 miles.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN W. NOBLE,

Colonel, Commanding.
