The major-general commanding is anxiously waiting your reply to the dispatch sent at 8. 30 p. m., inquiring whether you can throw a bridge across at once at Norman's Ford. Do the enemy occupy the heights overlooking the point where Newton had his lower bridge? Please answer at once, as time is of the utmost importance.

Major-General FRENCH, Commanding Left Column:

The major-general commanding desires to know where General Newton's command is, and at what hour he will probably be over the river. If he is not ordered down to Kelly's Ford, he should be ordered to be down at early daylight. What indication have you of the force and position of the enemy in your front, and how far out on the roads have your reconnaissances or scouts been?

I sent you a dispatch by your orderly, telling you Sedgwick had carried the rifle-pits and redoubts this side the river. Captured 1,000 prisoners, 4 colonels, 3 lieutenant-colonels, 4 guns, 4 battle-flags. Kilpatrick will cross at Kelly's Ford at daylight and cover your left, and look out for the enemy toward Mountain Run and Stevensburg.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

11. 45 p. m.

P. S. - Kilpatrick will cross at Ellis' Ford or Kemper's, instead of Kelly's.
