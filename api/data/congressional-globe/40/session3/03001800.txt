THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 2,
proposition is that the contract has been taken
too cheaply. It will only cost $195,000, and
if we allow this to go in it will probably cost
$300,000.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the amendment of the Senator from
Minnesota to strike out the proviso in lines
twelve and thirteen.
The amendment was rejected, there being
on a division—ayes nine, noes not counted.
Mr. RAMSEY. Let it pass for the present.
I will renew it in the Senate. On page 2, line
twenty, I propose to increase the appropria-
tion for clerks for post offices from $2,000,000
to $2,500,000. I will state that the estimate
of the Department was §2,5.00,000, and I can
see no reason for striking it down. I will send
to the desk a letter of the Postmaster General
to be read in explanation of the amendment.
The Secretary read the following letter:
Post Office Department,
Washington, February 2,1869.
Sib : Inclqsed I have marked the items where the
appropriations have been cut down by the Appro-
priation Committee. The estimate I made for post
office clerks is not too high. The business of the
post offices is constantly increasing, and new calls
are constantly made for additional clerk-hire. It
will be most mischievous to the service to cut the
appropriation down.
The amount expended last year for .mail-bags,
mail-catchers, &c., was about one hundred and four-
teen thousand dollars, I believe. The report will
show. That item is cut down to $30,000. New bags
are constantly required, and the mails will be seri-
ously damaged if the supply of good bags is at all
restricted. The same kind of embarrassment Will
occur if the appropriation for locks and stamps is
cut down. Cutting off $1,000,000 for next year will
require a material reduction of the mail service. X
shall not be here to be annoyed by applications for
additional service or to bear complaint that must
arise if these appropriations are not made; but my
successor will have great trouble about these ques-
tions, and the service will materially suffer.
Very truly, '
„ A. W. RANDALL.
Hon. J. J?. Farnsworth.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I call the atten-
tion of the Senator to the last provision of this
bill, which is evidently intended to cover any
deficiency of that sort, and I ask him whether
in his judgment that is not ample ? It provides
85,740,000 for supplying deficiencies in the
revenues of the Post Office Department.
Mr. RAMSEY. Oh, no; the Senator does
not understand it. The last provision of the
bill provides for any deficiency in .the postal
treasury. Supposing you make the appropri-
ation in the previous part of this bill, that would
probably produce a deficiency say of $5,000,000
in the postal treasury, and it makes that up by
an appropriation oat of the national Treasury ;
but you could not make up this deficiency for
clerks from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000 without
being authorized by this law. The Post Office
Department has estimated for this amount.
The increase of the service all over the country
seems to require it, and there can be no motive
for the present officials in that Department to
overestimate the wants of the country in this
regard. I think it but fair to give it to them.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Well, sir, I do
not know that it is not so.
The PRESIDING OFFICER put the ques-
tion, and declared that the ayes appeared to
have it.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I ask for a
division.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I wish simply to say, on
the statement ot the Senator from Minnesota
and the statement of the Postmaster General
which he reads, it appears that the amount
named in the bill is not sufficient to carry on
the business of the Post Office Department.
Now, if we are to vote money for anything we
must vote for it on the statements of the heads
ofDepartmeutsasto the necessity for it. There
is nothing in the world shown why this is not
necessary. The chairman of the Committee on
Appropriations gets up and says, "I do not
know that it is not so," and then the Senate
vote it down.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
will put the question again.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. R A MSE Y. I now wish to offer an amend-
ment in the thirty-fifth line.
The clause now reads:
For detecting and preventing mail depredations
and for special agents $82,000; and no greater sum
shall be paid special agents than is hereby provided.
The estimate is $118,350, and I have a com-
munication from the Department in explana-
tion of this item which 1 will send to the Chair.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. What is your
motion?
Mr. RAMSEY. My motion is to increase
the appropriation to the estimate of the Depart-
ment, which is $118,350; and here is a letter
from the Post Office Department in explana-
tion of it which I ask to have read.
The Secretary read the following letter;
Post Office Department,
Contract Office, Inspection Division,
Washington, February 28,1869.
Sir: I have the honor to report the following as
the number of paid special agents of this Depart-
ment for the respective years mentioned below as
obtained from the official register, the intervening
years of 1862,1864, and 1866 approximating 1861,1863,
1865, and 1867; also the amount charged annually to
the account of " special agents and mail depreda-
tions," for the fiscal year ending June 30,1861, to
June 30,1868, inclusive:
Number Amount
special agents. paid.
186 1  21 $47,837 22
186 2  21 48,320 06
1863  .113 45,719 39
186 4  16 49,932 62
1865   33 62,935 22
1866   33 95,756 88
186 7    42 123.074 05
186 8   49 138,905 16
By the act approved March 3,1865, an additional
special agent was appointed for the Pacific coast at
a salary of $2,500 per annum, and a sum not exceed-
ing five dollars per diem for incidental expenses.
Previous to the passage of the act referred to there
was only one special agent nn the Pacific coast. The
same act'authorized the Postmaster General to in-
crease the per diem of all other special agents to a
sum not exceeding five dollars, and as it was found
that the amount previously allowed—two dollarsper
diem—was totally inadequate, on account of the in-
creased cost of living, to pay their expenses, other
special agents have been allowed from two to four
dollars per diem, according to their several localities
and the character of the services required by them.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant.
GEORGE W. MeLELLAN,
Second Assistant Postmaster General.
Hon. Alexander Ramsey, Committee Post Offices and
Post Roads, United States Senate.
Mr. RAMSEY. I will state that in the
appropriation bill of last year $100,000 was
appropriated for this purpose. It seems but
reasonable in the growth of the affairs of the
Department that this little increase should
occur from $100,000 to $118,000 ; and it seems
to me very unreasonable that the appropria-
tion should be cut down now to $80,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY. I desire to move an amend-
ment in the next clause, which reads :
For mail-bags and mail-bag catchers, $120,000.
The Departmenthave estimated for $130,000,
and I move to increase that item to the esti-
mate of the Department.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. That is so near
the estimate that I would not do it.
Mr. RAMSEY. Very well; I will passthat
by, but this balance accumulates from year to
year, and it will require a very large appro-
priation some other year. That is the only
difference. Probably before we pass it over I
ought to say that I have a communication from
the Department on the subject; but still as
the chairman says that the difference is very
slight I will let it pass. I now call attention
to the clause in lines forty-one, forty-two, and
forty-three, which reads:
For miscellaneous payments, including payment
of balances to foreign countries, $250,000.
I move to amend that by making the appro-
priation $875,000. This reduction on the part
of the House of Representatives was a clear
mistake. The miscellaneous disbursements
under that head amount to the sum appropri-
ated here alone, and the balance due foreign
countries amounts to between three and four
hundred thousand dollars.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. The Senator
has a communication on that subject I believe ?
Mr. RAMSEY. Yes, sir; and I will send
it to the desk and have it read.
Mr.- MORRILL, of Maine. The Committee
on Appropriations concurred in the House
proposition upon the statement in the Globe
from one of the managers of the bill in the
House that in a conversation at the Depart-
ment he was told that the estimate was a mis-
take and that this sum was all that was neces-
sary. I think the Senator from Minnesota
showed me a communication- the other day
which seemed to contradict that statement or
showed that there was a misapprehension
about it.
Mr. RAMSEY. It was a clear mistake on
the part of the member of the House who
made the inquiry at the Department. It was
a misapprehension on Ms part entirely. I ask
that the letter be read.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The com-
paunication will be read.
The Secretary read it, as follows :
Post Office Department,
February 24,1869.
Sir : I have the honor to ask your attention to tbe
following: In the estimates for expenses ot this De-
partment for the fiscal year ending June 30,1870. as
submitted to the House of Representatives on De-
cember 12,1868, there appears the following item:
"For miscellaneous payments, including balances
due foreign countries, $875,000," which was made up
in the following njanner: For rent, light, fuel, and
incidental expenses of post offices, $500,000; for mis-
cellaneous payments, the characterof which may be
seen by reference to pages 147 to 152 inclusive o f re-
port of 1867 herewith inclosed, $75,000; and for bal-
ances to foreign countries. $300,000. In the bill, as
passed by the House of Representatives, this item
has been reduced to $250,000, or barely sufficient to
meet the payments to foreign countries.
I would therefore request that some provision be
made for the other items embraced in the original
item for which $575,000 were asked.
The amount actually expended for these items dur-
ing the year ending 30th June, 1868, as per report
now in the hands of the printer, were—
For rent, light, fuel, &c $403,360 76
For miscellaneous expenses  6a,990 43
For balances to foreign countries  465,616 91
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
ALEXANDER W. RANDALL,
Postmaster General.
Hon. Alexander Ramsey, Chairman Committee on
Post OMceS) United States Senate.
Mr. RAMSEY. Balances on account of
foreign mails arise in this way: it seems that
the American letters sent abroad are three
fourths of them prepaid, while only about one
fourth of the foreign letters received here are
prepaid. This necessarily leaves a very large
balance in transactions, amounting to millions
of dollars on both sides, which must be remit-
ted to foreign countries and sent back, and to
do this requires an appropriation. The money
goes into the Treasury and is taken out again
and returned.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I am satisfied
that the provision in the bill was a mistake.
The amendmant was agreed to,
Mr. RAMSEY. I have, another amendment
to offer. I move to amend the bill by adding
the following as an additional section:
A nd be it further enacted. That the Postmaster Gen-
eral is hereby authorized to purchase for a post, office
the lot and building at thesouthwest corner of Lime-
stone and High streets, in Sprinjffield, Ohio, known
as the Episcopal church property, for the sum of
$10,000: Provided, however. That the entire cost to
be paid by tbe United States for the said property
and for fitting it up for a post ofiico shall not exceed
the sum herein appropriated.
The Senator from Ohio could explain this
matter fully if he were here. The proposition
has the approval of the Post Office Depart-
ment as an economical measure. It is to buy
a church conveniently situated, and it is for a
reasonable sum, to be made an advantageous
post office in the town of Springfield, Ohio.
Mr. GRIMES. What kind of a church is it-?
Mr. RAMSEY. I do not know what de-
nomination ; that is not important; but the
measure has the recommendation of the De-
partment.
Mr. GRIMES. I am not talking about the
character of the people who worship there;
but what is the structure made of? Wood?
Mr. RAMSEY. Brick or stone, I imagine.
There are a parcel of papers here on the sub-
