of th s country should be called on to pav bade
again that amount to supply the demands of the
Government He was not ior lncurnng a debt
merely to distribute money amongst those who
would receive two-thuds oí the amount, an 1 rot

heart and hand, and would mo /e that the present

The gentleman from Tennessee, (Mr Bell,) Mr
P continued, has maintained that the deposite aT
ws a contutet binding upon this Government, and,
by consequence, that w e w ere bound to m ikt the
distr bution whether we wanltd it or not Mr P
sud he could not thus view that act He looked
upon it as a deposite acf, and not a dis'tibution act

suiyofthe General Government This was the

for which we can appiopnate money under the
Constitution, to g ve it to Ihe States Mi P then
read ihe clau e in the act regu'atmg Ihe deposites
anu the conditions as follows
Sic 13 Anille il fmther enacted, That Ihe mo-
ney which shall be in the Treasmy of the United
States on the first day of Tanuaiy, eighteen hun-
ched and thirty-seve i, reserving the sum of fue
millions of dollars, snail be deposited with the
several States, m piopouion to their respective
representation m the Senate and House oí Repre-
sentatives of the United Sta es as shall by la v au-
thorize their Tieasurers or other comp"tcnt autho-
rities to recene the same on the teims lercinafter
specified And the Secretary of the Treasury shall
dehvei the same to such Tieasmer, or other com-
petent authorities, on receiving ceitificates of depo-
site therefor, signed by such competent authorities,
m such foim as may be prescribed by the feecie
tary aforesaid, which ceitilicatc shad cxpiess the
usual and le, il ob'igat ons, an I pledse the faith of
ihe 'state lor the safe keeping and repayment
thereof; and shJl pledge the laith of the Stat s
receiving the same to pay the said moneys, and
every part thtreof, from time to time, w henever
the same shall *c lequiied by the Stxietary of the
Treasury, fir the pulpóse of üeíia}iig any wants
of the public Treasury beyond the amount of the
five m  ons ofoiesaid Ptoiided, That if any State
declines te receive its proportion of the surplus
afoiesaid, on the terms before named, the same
shall be deposited w itb the o'her States agieeiti? to

is deposited, and shall not be cal ed foi m sums ex-
ceeding ten thousand dollars from any one Slate,
in anyone month, without previous notice of thirty
day s for eveiy additional sum of twenty thousand
dollars witch may at any time be required
He then argue 1 at length to show that it did not
paitike of the natuie if a contract, but a meie re-
gulation of the surplus that might be in the Trea
sury, so intended, and bearing hat intent up n ns
face The title of ihe act was, 'A bill to legulate
tl e d posi es of the public money "
He was at a loss to conceive how this coul 1 be
called a contract, which was intended asa direc-
tion to the Secietary of the Tteasmy There was
no specific sum limed to be delivered, and, if a
conttact, fiom its face, no s) ecific sum coul I be re-
coveiel The gentleman had said that it w as a
con ¡act s-tip dating the sum for the use ai d benetit
of th  States Tncre u is n y si pidation of the
kind even n"ired m the act The vvoids use ind
benefit did noi oc ui P was a bi inch of the Trea
sary which th-1 Stites might emit o' and dispose of
at their own nsl and responsibility The only se-
em ty eqii> cl was their futh Tae limitations in
the pet wee urn talions upon the Seeietary oí tne
Treasury, n it to draw back any sums except in a
certain way ind nnde i cm lam lestnct ons, but
theie was no limitation imposed by tna act ovei
Congiess Confess mu,ht cad rainrelntely for
the whole amount by any appiopmtions they might
make, but the hecietiry could no( it lmu'ed him,
but not Congiess.   Suppose we had been visited
with foreign invasion, do you suppose that we
could not then withhold the fouuh instalment,
because we weie bound by contract to pay it
ovei'' As well might it be said that the la\v re-
gulating the Treasurei, and giving him funds un-
der certain conditions, was a contract, ard we
were bound to give hiai the funds, whether m the
Tre^saiy oi not We had something of a t ontract
with tne United States Bank, created m 1816, by
which we were bjund to deposite the surplus with
tiat mslituti m, u eler certain conditiens Those
deposites were seized and removed in defiance of a
p'ain contrae!, and yet the gentleman, with hs
friends, I believe, sustained that w dhdranal of the
funds And we are now to be to'd that we must
pay ovei the fouith instalment, und°r a contract,
even though there be no surplus funds How
absunl must our position be, to say that we must
now, under contiac>, make this deposite, when by
•hat contract, if eontiaet it be, it can be immedi-
ately recalled for pppiopnations, and which even
the Seeiptary of the Treasury is authorized to recall
in diffetent simsif needed for any appropnations
made by law This seems to be any thing but
financial wisdom If this had been a contract he,
Mr P never would have v oted for it He was
not for an entne postponement, but for disembar-
rassing the Treasury at present, and enforcing fu-
tme economy, so as to make the deposite or divi-
sion hereafter It wps not the time for the South
to run the risk of incurring a debt merely to di -
tribute a few thousand dollars, while others would
get millions If it be a contract, show the bond,
and he would comply, although it might take not
only the "pound of flesh," but blood too
REMARKS   OF MR   CUSHMAN,
Of New Hampshire.
in the House of Representatives, Septembei 22,1837__
Made m Committee of the Whole House on the
state oi the Union, upon the bill to suspend the
4th instalment of the deposite act of June, 1836
Mr Cn urman, consider ng the position which
I occupied m the last Congress, relatn e to the sub-
ject now under consideration, I hoj e the committee
will indulge me while I m ke a few remarks
The gentlemen w ho oppose the passage of this
bill, do it upon the giound that the law of June,
1836, was a contract made by the United States
wi h the seveial States, by which the Geneial Go-
vernment is bound to dehvei to the seveial States
in four equal instalments, their due proportion of
all the surplus revenue which should be found in
the Tieasury of the United States on the first day
of January, 1837, save five milhons On the pas-
sage of ihe bill regulahng the public deposites, I
recorded my vote in the negative, therefore I shall
be excused, if I shall contend ¡hat both m letter
and spirit, that law is merely to regulate the depo-
ne of the surplus revenue of the Un ted States,
and not a eontiaet by which the Unite 1 States
would be legally and moiaUy oound to pay money
to the seveial States, whether that money is in the
public Tieasury or not If it be true tnat the
United States aielegally, as w ell as moially bound
to dehvei over the fouith instalment theiem men-
t oned to the seveial States, according to the elecla-
lations which have been made, oyer and over
again by gentlemen upon this floor, then I acknow-
ledge that I hav e been wholly mistaken as to the
prov isions oí that law Gentlemen ¿ay that it is a
contract which em'd be legally enforced m a coutt
of justice, if the United States were amenable to
civil process: If so, this bill to withho'd the
fourth instalment ought nol to pass ÜN'ay, more s,r
if theie be any mo al obligation restng upon the'
General Government to delivti ovei or deposite,
this money to die sev eral States, then it ought not
to be withheld, for when we legislate, wc should do
it upon principles a* far above all legal liabilities
as the heavens are above the earth
I contend, how ever, thd the deoosite act snot
sjch a eontiaet a" has been pietevided It is meie a
gratuity, vvh ch cannot fe rm the basis of a legal
ennt'aa Neither does lt jay t}ie United Stales
under any moral obligation to deposite money w th
the -.everal Mates, which she does not now possess
