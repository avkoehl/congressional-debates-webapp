The able chairman of the Committee on the
Public Lands, [ijr. Julian,] in his report against
granting lauds to soldiers, basis his opposition
to the same upon the reason that it will lock
up and throw into the hands of speculators
nearly one fourth of the arable land belonging
to the Government. The bill under discus-
sion differs materially from the one so ably op-
posed by tny colleague. No transfer of the cer-
tificate except by heirship is allowed, and of
course no speculation. Nor shall I trouble
myself with the objection that another Congress
will make tliem assignable; they will be as
well qualified, I trust, and perhaps have more
light upon what ought to be done with the pub-
lic domain than the present. No such large
quantity as lie represents will be needed under
this bill.
The whole number of troops receiving $100
bounty during the whole war was only nine
hundred and sixteen thousand eight hundred
and ninety-four; of this number a large per
cent, reenlisted and received the large bounties
of the later years of the war. These should
not be counted in making the amount to yet
receive bounties. If we take as the average
of our Army a million of men, and their term
of service four years, which is large, much too
large, we only have $400,000,000 as the total
bounty to be paid, and out of this amount the
Government has already paid $850,000,000,
not taking into the estimate $280,781,25(5 09
paid by the States themselves. Fifty million
dollars will, in my opinion, more than cover
all the bounties uuder this bill; and to prove
that this is correct, the present bounty bill has
only called for about forty-six million dollars,
and this bill will take but little more ; not one
quarter of the amount that so startled the chair-
man ot the Committee on the Public Lands ;
but so far from taking from the Government
Treasury, 1 believe it will conduce much towards
replenishing her coffers. The purchasing of
large tracts in a body is a detriment, but
where they are small, as these will have to be,
they are a help to the actual settler. They assist
in making roads, buildings, school-houses, and
paying taxes generally ; and those of us who
have lived in new countries know that the set-
tlers know full well how to make them nav
their full share.
Nor will it prove detrimental to the home-
stead principle. Many a poor soldier will
continue to get West or South, settle on his
quarter section under the homestead law, and
purchase near it with his scrip, that would not
otherwise go West at all. Some of our States
deem that as they paid large local bounties
they would get no share of the benefits
derived from this bill. The following state-
ment from Colonel Gibson, in charge of the
payments under the act of 1866, shows the
payments to each Stale; and as the most of
these cases will be entitled to an additional
hundred, it will be seen at a glance that the
disparity between the different States does not
exist:

In closing, allow me to use the words of my
colleague, [Mr. Julias,] over two years ago :
"Equality is equity," and the nation cannot
refuse to heed this maxim in dealing with the
brave men who protected the law makers of
this Capitol during the war, and saved the coun-
try itself from destruction. Nor do we accept
the plea of national poverty, so often urged, in
the light of the boundless resources developed
by our war of four years. The amount required
for a fair equalization of these bounties, we are
sure, has been much over-stated; but whatever
it may be, we think it should be provided for
with no unnecessary delay. "With the sol-
diers there was no task too great, no sacrifice
too large, no duty too arduous, no hardship
too_severe; but with an alacrity that marked
their earnestness in the cause, they cheerfully
responded to every order,' claiming none other
shield than the consciousness that their ban-
ners were the emblems of liberty, of justice,
and of truth." _ The prayer of these men must
neither be denied nor evaded when they only
ask the nation for justice.
Mr. JULIAN, Mr. Speaker, when my hon-
orable colleague some time ago asked that this
bill might be made a special order for one hour
to-day,being opposed decidedly to the measure,
I only agreed that it might be made the special
order on the expres's condition that no action
was to be had on it now. It is hardly necessary
therefore to debate it at length. I have already
discussed it with a good deal of thoroughness
in a speech during the last session, and what I
said in opposition to the policy and the princi-
ple of the bill is substantially untouched by any
word that has been uttered by my colleague.
I have had no opportunity to examine the facts
and figures adduced by him as to the amount
of money his bill would require; but if his
calculations are correct, cutting down the aggre-
gate amount to fifty millions, "he simply miti-
gates the force of the unanswered argument
that I made on the'basis of a larger amount.
That argument has not been met, and I believe
cannot be met-; and perhaps I may as well
restate it, so that the House may consider it in
connection with that of my colleague. I will
add, in the outset, that I subscribe to-day to
every word of the report of the Committee on
the Public Lands as quoted by ray colleague ;
and that my opposition to this bill is perfectly
consistent with what 1 said in that report.
Mr. Speaker, this bill provides that, instead
of assignable land warrants, there shall be
issued to the soldier a certificate of indebted-
ness for the amount of his bounty, computed
at the rate of eight and one third dollars per
month for his time of service, and drawing six
per cent, interest, which certificate shall be
used only by him or his heirs, and be payable
only in land. This, in effect, though in other
words, is the same thing as so many non-
assignable land warrants. These certificates,
as 1 shall presently show, would certainly be
made assignable by Congress at an ea'rly day ;
but for the sake of the argument I will admit
that their non-assignable character is to be
preserved, and that such is the bona fide pur-
pose of the bill. It must follow, then, most
conclusively, that its aim is not to give land
to those who really need it for cultivation.
The fraction of our solders who are farmers,
and actually want homes on the public domain,
can have theui now, under the homestead
law; and under the House bill before re-
ferred to, which will doubtless pass the Sen-
ate, the soldier can have a home on the lands
of the Government without money and with-
out price. Probably a small portion only
of our soldiers and seamen desire to settle on
the public domain ; but those of them who do
would seek title uuder the homestead law,
since a gift of lands under that would be just
as good as a gift under a law providing the
same thing under the name of bounty, while
the certificates of indebtedness would of course
be used in the purchase of other and addi-
tional lands, to be hold for some indefinite
time for a rise in the price. Who does not see
that this would be the exact operation of this
measure? The lands taken under it would be
withheld from settlement and tillage, for the
palpable reason that no man would buy them
when just such lands could be had free of cost.
To argue otherwise is first-rate nonsense. The
quantity of land which would thus be locked
up from the landless and laboring poor of the
country is given in the following official letter
from Secretary^ Stanton, in April last, in an-
swer to an inquiry addressed to him by myself:
"In compliance with the request of the chairman
of the Committee on the Public Lands of thellouseof
Representatives, for a statement of the amount of
public lands necessary to meet the requirements of
the proposed bill (H. R. No. 940) "to equalize the
bounties of soldiers, sailors, and marines who served
m the late "war for the Union,'in the event of its
becoming a law, I have the honor to communicate a
report on the subject by the Paymaster General of
the Army, dated the 2d instant, as follows:
In a communication from this office to the Secre-
tary of War, and dated March 31,1866, will be found
a carefully-prepared estimate of the amount of money
required to pay the bounties under a bill then pend-
ing-in the Senate introduced by the chairman of the
Military Committee.
,, . ^iiat^^J?y,assubstantiallythesameinitstermsas
this House bill No. 910, exccpt as to the manner of
making payment.
; The sum estimated was $253,691,100.
In my letter ofAugu:*(,6,1866, addressed to General
Vincent, Assistant Adjutant General, will be found
another caretully-prepared estimate, showing the
a^°jI* r££u\rc(* to pay the additional bounties pro-
vided by the law of July 28,1866.
fhe sura estimated was $58,634,300.
■experience so far gives indication that this last
estimate is rather short than in excess of the exact
truth.
'deducting this cost of the additional bounties from
the amount of the first estimate for equalization of
bounties, the remainder gives a pretty close approx-
imate estimate of the further amount that would be
S^^^pnderthobill in question, namely: $195,056,-
oOO, which, m land at $1 25 per acre, will require one
hundred and fifty-six millions forty-five thousand
tour hundred and forty acres. No note is taken
herein of the local bounties not paid by the United
btates, lor I have no means ol ascertaining their
amount." *
