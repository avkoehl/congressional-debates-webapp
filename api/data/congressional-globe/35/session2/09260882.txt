Tlio difference of food consumed by laborers
abroad and laborers at home, indicates the differ-
ence in wages received. The farmer evidently
*eaps the benefit of the high wages paid at home,
ana can all the better afford to pay a higher price
for better iron.
A ton of bar iron made in this country makes
a market to the farmer for a ton of wheat, and a
ton of r^ils nearly as much. If we take, instead
of all wheat, a part only, and the' rest vegetables
and fruits, the bulk will be greater, than a ton of
food for a ton of bars or railroad iron.
The same rule applies to the consumption of
everything else the American laborer needs; re-
ceiving higher wages than the foreign laborer, he
is able and willing, and does consume, more of
everything; and,therefore, every other industrial
pursuit in the country is benefited by a class of
nome consumers, who furnish a market, worth
more than that of all the countries furnishing us
with iron, for the products of agriculture.
Let the test be applied to our imports, and sec
"what American laborers would have consumed,
had the same iron been produced at home instead
of abroad:

people whom I represent, in part, on this floor. I
have reference to the impression which seems
too general, in and out of Congress, that under the
operations of the revenue system, the manufac-
turing States have enjoyed great incidental ben-
efits, which have been in no way reciprocated to
the others; and I intend to show the total fallacy of
that belief. If the South and West complain of
the revenue laws, the North and East can point
to the postal system and the donations of public
lands in a similar spirit. If it be true that my
State and others have been incidentally benefited
by the tariff, it is equally true, as I shall show,
that the munificcncc of the Government has not
been confined alone to tariffs; that it has been
manifested in a far morn direct manner by dona-
tions of the public lands to States for railroad and
other purposes, And it is to be regretted, sir,
that the States which have received most in this
way, seem least inclined to reciprocate the favor,
sofaras the manufacturing interests are concerned.
Having had such essential aid in building their
railroads, they should not be parsimonious in the
matter of helping Pennsylvania and other States
to furnish them with the best quality of iron for
their roads.
Now, sir, for the land grants, which I prefer
to present in tabular form, showing the amount
of land, in acres, granted to railroad companies,
and to States for railroad and other purposes, at
different periods,from 1850 to 1857:

Totals

in ten years.
Our total exports to Great Britain during the
same ten years, were, in agicultural products and
vegetable food, $214,103,628; or, as a bushel of
wheat represents one dollar,214,103,628 bushels;
which is but little more than twenty-five per
cent, greater than would have been consumed by
the makers of the iron we nnpoucd, had it been
made at home.
Under the head of agricultural products, is in-
cluded beef, pork, butter, cheese, &c., besides live
stock and wool. Convert 165,670,738 bushels of
wheat, at sixty pounds per bushel, into tons and
pounds, and we have 4,437,609 tons of wheat em-
bodied into 4,008,617 tons of iron, &c., &c., im-
ported, (old non excepted;) being a greater weight
than the iron itself by one third of a million tons.
But upon the basis of foieign consumption, name-
ly, $30 per head, the tonnage will show that, m
the ten years rcfrmd to, there was imported
three fifths of 4,437,(509 tonsi of wheat, namely,
2,662,526 tons, m the form of iron.
What would the faimers say if, before this im-
mense amountof agricultural products had entered
into the iron, they could see it arriving jn bulk at
our Atlantic ports, and there be converted into
iron made out of oth,er foreign material also,
namely, coal, ore, limestone, &c. ? 1 know that
more than one Senator is ready to ask, what we
should have done for revenue had the 4,098,000
tons of non been manufactured in this country?
and I answer, we always import all we can pay
foi; and the place of the iron would have boon
supplied by some article which oar country does
not produce.
Nothing is more unpleasant to my feelings than
to allude to the country m a sectional point of
view, or to notice the States separately, concern-
ing the relations they bear towards the Federal
Government. But I am impelled to the task be-
fore me by a sense of justice to my State; to the
The total amount of lailroad iron imported up
to 80th January, 1858, was 1,816,523 tons, valued
at $68,833,793, on which duties to the amount of
$25,126,643 were paid. Of this sum $6,313,300
were refunded, leaving the actual duties paid on
railroad iron up to the present time, $18,753,313.
There are now about thirty thousand miles of
railroad in the United States, and the States re-
ceiving the lands, as already named, contain about
seven thousand five hundred miles, or 750,000 tons
of railroad iron, valued at §31,185,000; on which
dunes to the amount of $4,688,328 were paid.
The total value of iion and of iron manufac-
tuies imported from 1851 to 1858, inclusive, is
$168,242,961; on which duties to the amount of
$40,289,0*1 20 wore paid.
Now, Mr. President, permit me to review this
account for a few minutes. As the duty on rail-
road iion has been the subject of special com-
plaint, I shall deduct fiom the aggregate value of
the land grants, as above stated, the total amount
of duties paid on raihoad iron from the day the
first bar was imported up to the close of the fiscal
year, say $18,753,313, and a balance of §81,949,157
lemains; of this aggregate of duties, the States re-
ceiving the land grants for railroads paid less than
five millions. But, sir, to be still more generous,
suppose we deduct the aggregate value of all the
l ail road iron used in the same States, less the
duties, say $31,185,000, and the balance is still
$50,764,157. But, sir, wc can go further and de-
duct the total amount of duties paid on iion and
iron manufactures since the first land'grant m
1850, less the duties on railroad iron already de-
ducted, and there js still left the handsome bal-
ance of 520,535,768.
I have thus shown that thje lands granted to the
South and West, to improve the physical condi-
tion of the country, arc worth more at a reason-
able valuation than the total duties paid on rail-
road iron, the value of the railroad iron used by
the States receiving the land, and the gross amount
of duties paid on iron, and iron manufactures of
every description since 1850; but still more, I find
that the following States have received, in addi-
tion, 55,129,492 acres of the public lands, appor-
tioned as follows;
Ohio  54,438 14
Indiana    1.334.732 50
Illinois  3,243.891 46

I have no data on which to base an opinion as
to the value of the swamp lands. I know that
they have not been of much account to the States
in their corporate capacity; but it is fair to esti-
mate them at their value to the citizens of the
States, for I am measuring their value against the
incidental benefits of the revenue system to the
people of the manufacturing States, and while
certain sections may not be worth ten cents per
acre, others would be cheap at ten dollars. At all
events, in connection with the foregoing balance
of $20,555,000, they constitute a nicc item to off-
set incidental protection.
But overforty-eight million acres of the public
lands have been given away on bounty warrants;
and I am aware that it has been alleged that my
State has received more than her pro rata share;
but I can find no evidence of the fact. But if it
be so, that fact could not properly be offered as a
set-off to the account I have presented. The
bounty lands were not given to the States, or to
companies to improve the physical condition of
the country; but to the veteran and patriotic sol-
dier wherever found, for services rendered to his
country m the field of battle. If it be true that my
State, or any other, furnished more than a pro
rata share of citizens for such service, the fact
should redound to her honor, and excite on the
part of all, the strongest feelings of gratitude and
generosity toward her.
But, sir, I must look into the burdens result-
ing to home consumers, from the principle of dis-
crimination, so much complained of in the South
and West. The total imports of iron and iron
manufactures for ten years, amounted to the gross
sum of $187,800,000; twenty-five percent, being
the average on dutiable goods. Iron was five per
cent, above the average, making this excess an
aggregate of duties of $9,300,000. Of this sum
the States receiving the lands for railroad pur-
poses, on the ratio of population, paid less than
one fifth—say §1,800,000.
IJut, sir. let us test this account on all the great
staples, woolens, cotton, hemp, iron, sugar, salt,
and coal. The total amount of duties paid upon
these for ten years, at thnty per cent., makes an
aggregate of §210,400,000. One sixth of that
would be five per cent., the amount of the dis-
crimination, say—$30,506,000, or at the rate of
$3,000,000 per annum,of which the land States
would pay £,600,000, being less than three fourths
of one per cent, on the value of the lands as al-
ready stated.
As for the assumption that the American con-
sumer pays as well on tlie domestic, as on the for-
eign ai tide, I shall not argue that point; whilst it
may be so, to a very Limited extent, for brief
periods, on certain articles, as a general proposi-
tion I discard it as a palpable fallacy. As to every
one of the staples I have named, should the home
production cease and the tariff be withdrawn, the
American consumer would pay for many years,
if not for an indefinite period, higher prices as a
consequence.
Nor, sir, is this all. These States, and others,
have notonly had munificent land grants, enough
in some instances not only to pay the duties on-
their railroad iron, but to pay for the iron, duty
and all, and contribute to build their raihoads be-
sides, but they have had a large proportion ot their
postal expenses paid out of the common Treas-
ury. If Senators will insist that the blessings
and burdens of Government, like the dews of
heaven, must fall alike on all, let them look to our
postal system for a work of equalization. 1 have
pursued the investigation far enough to discover
whose ox is gored. If it be true that the gratui-
ties of the revenue system flow north and east,
