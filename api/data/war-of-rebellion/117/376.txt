GENERAL: In compliance with instructions contained in your letter of July 28 to Major General John Pope (transmitted to me on the 11th instant) I have the honor to inclose the two reports* relating to the charges against Colonel James A. Mulligan, commanding at New Creek, Va.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 12, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,Adjutant-General of the Army, Agent, &amp;c., Aiken's.

GENERAL: Under all the circumstances of the case the commanding general is of the opinion that it would be highly impolitic at the present juncture to release the prisoners, some eighty in number, determined this morning to be sent for delivery to the Confederate at Aiken's. They are possessed of information which if communicated to the enemy at Richmond would possibly lead to serious detriment to our interests. He begs you therefore to represent to Mr. Ould that it is impracticable to release these prisoners to-day but they will be sent up as soon as practicable.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[S. WILLIAMS,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
