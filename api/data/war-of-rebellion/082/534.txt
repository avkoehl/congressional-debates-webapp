this morning was attacked below the junction of the Lee's Mill and the Prince George Court-House road, at Ambrose's house, by a party estimated about fifty. One man was killed, 2 wounded, and 2 captured. The wounded men have been instead of down to the mill? That country seems to be infested with guerrillas.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

A deserter just in from that part of the enemy's line near the upper pontoon bridge says they heard artillery crossing in the night. They did not know in what direction and the movement excited no suspicion. It is evident that the enemy commenced only about an hour and a half ago to re-enforce Richmond from Petersburg.

No reports. Have ordered careful observation; will keep you informed. At 10.30 a. m. a few infantry and wagons passed across Chaffin's farm, probably part of the garrison. Any further reports from Hancock?
