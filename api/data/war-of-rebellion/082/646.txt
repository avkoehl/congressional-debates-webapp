BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS, July 30, 1864 - 7 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The report from prisoners would indicate weakness in the enemy's line, and that a considerable portion of it has been vacated. If Burnside and Ord gain the crest the enemy cannot hold in your front, for they will be open to attack from front and rear. It was to take advantage of this contingency that I wanted to have your troops in hand. The orders to Mott are all right. If the enemy are in force and prepared you will have to wait developments, but if you have reason to believe their condition is such that an effort to dislodge them would be successful I would like to have it made. Burnside now occupies the line, but has not pushed up to the crest, though he reports he is about doing so.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 30, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Report from the Second Brigade, of General Mott's division, shows that the enemy are there in some strength, having two batteries which they fire seldom, owing to the close proximity of our riflemen. The commanding officer of the brigade says he can see every man who leaves his front to their right, and none have left since daylight. He is using mortars effectively. I will report any change of troops.

Major-General.

Major-General HUMHPREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

General Mott's remaining brigade developed the enemy in their front by putting their hats on reamers above the parapet, which elicited quite a spirited volley.
