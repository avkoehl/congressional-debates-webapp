to the event of the decease of their late President,

The Hon. JOHN  B.  DAWSON, member elect

DEATH OF THE  HON   CHARLES OGLE
Mr. COOPER of Pennsylvania then announced
the death of the Hon. Charlps Ootid
He died (said Mr C.) at his residence in Somei-
set, on the 10th of May last, in the midat of those
constituents of whom he was so proud, and who
loved him so well He had seaicely at'amed the
maturity of hi* intellect, when he wag cut off m
the midst of life. It might be said that he fell in
the very spring of promise But one brief year
ago, he bade as fair for a long life ps the youngest
and strongest amongst us, but neither you h nor
strength can shield from Death. The highe t m
place, for whom the profoundest respect of a nation
may be expresseJ, is as liable to be smitten down hy
his merciless aim, as the poorest and humblest
Again sad experience hasremmded n« of this trjth,
and it would be wise if we should, by this, be
taught a lesson of deep humility.
Mr. C. said it was not his purpose to deliver an
eulogium on the life and character of his deceased
colleague and friend. He would only say that
those who knew him best esteemed him most, and
that he was as much distinguished for his kindness
and benevolence in private life, as for his ability
and fidelity as a public man. With hi? bereaved
family he deeply and sincerely s) mpa hiz'd Their
loss wasineparabie How should they be con-
so'ed? Words of condolence, he knew, fell with-
out meaning on th^  ear of «orow, and there is no
comfort in them. But lei us (said Mr C.) trust
that the benignity cf t.im who "tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb," will not be 'ess kind to the wi-
dow and orphan children of om decea°ej friere*.
As Í tribute of respect to h^ memorv, an! to
show tho«e to whom hi wa- so dear tbat he is
held in recp ct ul and affcc'ionate remembrance
by us, with whom he was ps ocia'ed, I respectful-
ly ask the concurrence of the House in the tollcw-
lng resolutions.
Resolved, That the members of this House have
heard wnh deep sensibility of the death of the Hon.
Charles Ogle, late a Representa'ive from the
State of Pennsylvania.
Resolved, That as a testimonial of respect for
the character of the deceased, they will wear the
usual badge of mourning for ths space of thirty
days.
Resolved, That as a further testimonial of re-
spect, the House will now adjourn, to meet at
11 o'clock to-morrow.
The resolutions were adopted, and then, at 30
minutes past 19 o'clock,
The House adjourned.

Benton,
[The names of the Democrats are in Italic ]
Mr BARROW of Louisiana presented a memo-
rial from the Bar of New Orleans, stating that, in
consequence of the late dealh of the District Judge
of the United States in the district of Louisiana,
that office was now vacant, and a favorable oppor-
tunity was presented for the interposition of Con-
gress to augment the salary attached to the offiee.
The salary, at present, was but $3,000, a sura in-
competent to command the services of a gentleman
of high talent and legal attainment*, and the public
good urgently requtred that an adequate compensa-
tion be provided by law.
Mr. B sa'd he was fully aware that it was the
impression of many members, perhaps of a majori-
ty of the Sena'e, that, af the present called session,
no subjects but such a? were of general and na-
tional importance should be attended to, and these
gentlemen mignt object to this as merely a local
matter; but it is one in which 'he whole State of
Louisiana, and ultimately the people of the United
States, had a deep interest. Although he entirely
concurred in the opinion that the attention of an
extra session of Congress, convened under circum-
stances like the present, ought not to be diiected to
every subject usually acted on at stated and regu-
lar sessions, yet there were some subjects of so pe-
culiar a nature as to recommend themselves legiti-
mately to its action, and of that character was the
case stated m this memorial.  The system as well
of laws as of legal practice in Louisiana was
umque, and in refeience to this fact it might be
truly said that the people of that State were unre-
presented on the bench of the Suprsme Court. In-
deed, the j idges of that Court had frequently ac-
knowledged the embarrassment under which they
labored, when appea'b from Louisiana came be-
fore them. Hence aro-e a greater necessity that
the District Cjurt in that district should be occu-
pied by a man of iht highest legal a'tamments, the
very first and ablest lawyer in, the S ate should sit
on that bench, and the sa'ary ought to be such as
to secure a man of that standing. This would rid
the Supreme Court of much of the embarrassment
it now felt through its ignorance of the system of
Louisiana law He said this in no disposition to
derogate from that high tribunal; the fact arose
from the peculiarity of the circumstances, and im-
plied no fault. For want of the requisite know-
ledge, injustice had frequently been done, and tke
