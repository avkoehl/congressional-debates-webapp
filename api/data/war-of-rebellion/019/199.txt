tion. I quickly ordered those armed with sabers to advance 6 paces to the front, the balance to dismount, hitch their horses, and from on foot. This was all done promptly and in good order. Putting Lieutenant Colley in command of the cavalry, I ordered him to form on the right of the advance guard, which alone had as yet been seen by the enemy's pickets. As Lieutenant Colley's party came in view the enemy's pickets fled without firing. I then ordered Lieutenant colley to charge, which he did in gallant style. He found the enemy totally unprepared. Some were undressed and asleep; some sprang un ap and fled without either guns or clothes; others, snatching up their arms, retreated into a corn field close by and returned quite a spirited fire. I came up with the footmen at a full run, expecting that the cavalry would have to fall back. In this I was mistaken, for the cavalry, charging up to the fence and firing with their revolvers upon those in the field, put them all to flight, expect four, who were left dead upon the field. Many others, from the way ran, were thought to be severely wounded. After crossing a corner of the field they reached a thick brush, into which it was impracticable to follow them. We captured 23 horses, 2 mules, 30 stand of small-arms, 75 saddles and bridles, all their commissary stores, numbers of saddle-bags full of clothing, all their camp equipage, numbers of blankets, hats, shoes, &amp;c., as well as the colonel's trunk, containing all his documents, and many other articles. I endeavored to obtain a wagon, in which to bring away the plunder, but failing in this, and not considering it safe to remain long in the place, I had all the things burned which we could not carry away. Two of my men were wounded, one seriously. We left him in the care of a Union Citizens. The other was a slight buck-shot wound in the chin. The name of the man we left is -- --. The name of the other wounded man is Mark B. Evans. Sergeant Baxter received a full load of buck-shot in the breast but was unhurt, the shot not entering the flesh. Both officers and men conducted themselves in a manner that would do credit to veteran soldiers. The attack was made at sunrise, and the battle lasted about ten minutes. The enemy numbered about 150 men, commanded, as at Ozark, by Colonel Lawther. After the close of the battle we returned to Ozark, where we arrived at 10 o'clock in the night, after an absence of thirty hours, having rested only one hour and a half of that time, and having marched 80 miles over very rough roads.
