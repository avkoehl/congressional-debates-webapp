j.rs1nt,ui.y is piuaeui ana must lor a long
time to come bo dependent-in great measure upon
th ose roads for passenger travel and commercial traffic
with the eastern States and western coast; that while
we aro not unmindful of the great outlay of money
necessary to build and equip these roads, we are still
of the opinion that the rates of passenger fare and
freight now charged and allowed by law by the Cen-
tral Pacific Company are greatly disproportionate to
the exponses oj building and running that road, and
altogether too high, both for the true interest of the
company and the prosperity of the country; that we
are led to .this conclusion by a comparison of the
tariff of prices now ftilowed by law and charged by
the Oontval Pacific Company with the tariffs of other
roads, nnd particularly as com paved with the tariffs
of the Union Pacific road; that this opinion is sup-
poiled and strengthened by the fact that the present
tariff by rail from our Territory to the city of Chi-
cago. a distance of over sixteen hundred miles, is
about seven cents per mile, whilefrom this Territory
to ban Francisco, a distance of about seven hundred
miles by the Central Pacific road, tbo tariff isoharged
ten cents in gold, being equal to nearly fourteen
cents per mile. This opinion is further supported by
the published official report of the earnings and ex-
penses of tbe Central Pacific road during the last
two years. We, your memorialists, therefore respect-
fully recommend to your honorable bodies that said
Central Pacifio Railroad Company be restricted to
lower rates of fare for passengers and froightthan
the high and ruinous rates now allowed by law, and
that the same may be established upon terms that
your honorable bodies may deem equitable and just
and for the development a nd benefit of the country
as well as the interest of the corporation whose en-
terprise is the grandest scheme of internal improve-
ment ever conceived by any nation in any age* and
your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray.
