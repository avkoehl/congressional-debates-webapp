Outlet for the Products of the West—Mr. Negley.
42:D CONGI .... 3D
the estimate that twenty-five million tons
is a minimum showing for the products of
last year that the West could have spared
had the means of transport been available
and the rates of freight been reasonable.
To give a clearer idea of the want of trans-
portation, let us look at the means at hand for
moving this great volume of produce. The
Erie canal has a capacity of seven million
tons for through freight. The greatest ca-
pacity of all the railways crossing the Alle-
ghanies may be estimated at ..eight million
tons for through freights ; and what goes by
the St Lawrence and the lower Mississippi
may be put at four million tons, which makes
in all nineteen million tons. This is simply
theoretic capacity of these different modes
of transportation ; for, in point of fact, but
little . more than half this through tonnage
does go, according to the theory laid down.
It is further believed that of this twenty-five
million tons, the West wanted to send Bast, not
over half of it really went, which gives an im-
pression of the immense loss by the citizens and
the country at large through the general ab-
sence of available transportation. It is hardly
a figure of speech to say that the privilege
of carrying the cereals of the West during the
winter is put up at auction by the railway
companies, and sold to the highest bidders.
The productive capacities of the West and
South will expand more rapidly now than
before the war. The States east of them will
necessarily be their largest purchasers. An
uninterrupted and reciprocal trade between the
two sections should be encouraged, to make
stronger and closer the bonds of the Union,
and banish sectionalism forever. Formerly,
when the South was absorbed in the cultiva-
tion of cotton, sugar, and rice, a fair propor-
tion of the northern products went by the chan-
nel of the Mississippi river to the extreme
South. But the South since the war has taken
to the cultivation of what were formerly only
northern products, and this turned away from,
the South a certain quantity of staples toward
the East. Thus the proportion of the crop
sent eastward is increasing.
People along the lower end of the Missis-
sippi river think that this great river should be
made the outlet of the products of the whole
valley, extending to the hp3dwifers of all its
navigable tributaries, and claim that they can
send a bushel of grain from St. Paul, by way
of New Orleans, to New York at about half
what it costs by rail, which is probably true.
Commercial men, however, have not so far
availed themselves to the desired extent of
sending by this way their products of the'upper
Mississippi valley to New York, or any other
of the eastern markets. The objections urged
against it are that it takes too much time, and
that the grain is liable to injury by sweating in
the warm climate through which it necessarily
passes. But whether the grain is subject to
this sweating process or not, in going through
an almost tropical climate, the apprehension
of it does actually deter most shippers from
using the route. Even if these objections did
not exist, the outlet by way of New Oileans
would not be sufficient. Further, this route
Joes not encourge the development of the min-
eral resources of the interior. There are now
only two convenient water routes to New York,
that by way of New Orleans, and the other by
the great lakes and theNew York canals. The
former, putting aside the matter of climate, is
a little more costly than it would be if the in-
creased rates of insurance, on account of the
upper and lower rapids, were removed. If a
fit appropriation is made to cause the enhance-
ment of insurance rates to disappear, the route
will naturally become cheaper. The friends
of this route claim that they can, with the
rapids improved, and proper dredging at the
mouth of the Mississippi, send a bushel of
wheat from St. Paul to New York for fifty-five
cents, which is thus figured:

This, doubtless, is a favorable showing, a®
the two per cent, insurance is said to cover all
risks—wreck, fire, and sweating. The dis-
tance from St. Paul to the mouth of the Mis-
sissippi is 1,957 miles; hence, through the
Gulf and ocean to New York, 2.400 miles,
making a total distance of 4,357 miles, which
is considerably further than from New York
to Liverpool, as will be observed here. It
is. not so much the cost, as the time occu-
pied in this transit, which makes it open to
objection ; for k must be remembered that the
interest on the money value of products is
from seven to ten per cent.
Calculated on the other basis, namely, river
navigation at two and a half mills per ton per
mile, and ocean navigation one and a half
mills per ton per mile, the New Orleans route
would be as follows: to the. mouth of the
Mississippi, 1,957 miles at two and a half mills",
$4 89, thence to New York by Gulf and ocean,
2,400 miles, at one and a half mills, $3 60; 1
total $8 49, which would be a fraction over
forty-two cents per bushel. This presumably
does not include insurance and transfers.
However, whatever objections may be..made
to this water route to New York, it is inpoiut
of cheapness naturally much superior to any
railway line.
An effort was being made, a short time ago,
to stimulate business over this route by a com-
bination between the Illinois Central railway
and a line of steamboats, with barges, running
from Cairo to New Orleans; but, I believe,
the combination has not, so far, been effected ;
and whether it should be or not, this extreme
southern route will doubtless always command
a certain portion of the shipments of the upper
valley of the great river. All the products
which go by the St. Lawrence and the Missis-
sippi, both routes, do not exceed four ipillion
tons, while what goes over the Erie canal
amounts to seven millions, probably three or
four times as much as goes by the Mississippi.
This shows, so far, the Erie canal to be. the
favorite water route in the West, and if has
unquestionably done much toward developing
the resources of the soil from which it draws
its transportation.
A tolerably fair estimate of the increase and
total receipts of grain handled at the port of
St. Louis is shown in the annexed table, which
I have made up from the most reliable reports
obtainable:

As a further illustration of the enormous
crops of wheat moved to the sea-board during
the past year, I give the quantities received at
three of the lake ports alone:
"At Chicago there were received 71,261,563 bushels
of corn, wheat, and oats, against 71,082,208 bushels
in the preceding year. The increase in tho quantity
shipped was maca more marked, tho figures beins
71,563,652 bushels in 1872, and 61,772,226 bushols in
1871. The total receipts of all kinds of grain at
Chicago were 76,585,736 bushels in 1872, against
77,163,406 bushels in 1871, and only 52,485,408 bushels
in tho previous year. Tho flour trade seoms, how-
ever, to be declining, tha receipts having fallen off
nearly a million barrels biuoe 1869.
"At Toledo, where the grain trade is comparatively
new, the receipts in 1872 were 20,819,956 bushols of
all kinds 0f grain. The flour trade increased con-
siderably.
"At Milwaukee 18.782.672 bushels of grain wore
received.
"It appears, therefore, that 100,000,000 bushels of
frain, to say nothing of Hour and other breadstuff's,
ave passod through those three ports during the
last twelve months."
As to the charges of transportation by rail,
the rates on the principal roads leading to
New York may be taken as a fair average.
Being competing lines, they not only compete
with each other, but endeavor to do so with
the Erie canal when it is open ; hence their
charges are more'reasonable than interior or
lateral roads. This season's rates are all
"fourth-class" articles, such as flour, grain,
hogs, &c., sixty-five cents per hundred
pounds from Chicago to New York. This
is one and four tenths cents per ton per mile.
From St. Lou,s to Pittsburg, thirty-five cents
per hundred pounds. The rate charged on
the Chicago and St. Paul railroad has been
one and a half cents per ton per mile, or fifteen
Cunts per mile for a car carfying ten tons.
Comparing these charges with those by
water when navigation is open, on the lakes
we find the rates from Chicago to Buffalo are
five to ten cents a bushel on wheat ; and from
Buffalo to New York, through the canal,
eleven to fourteen cents, tolls included ; but
that when the bulk of the western crop is
pressed forward in the autumn, the rates from
Chicago to Buffalo advance to twenty-five or
twenty-six cents, and from Buffalo to New
York to as high as thirty cents, which is far
beyond the rate at which the canal can carry
freight, but advantage is naturally taken of the
immense demand for transportation and the
insufficient means at hand.
Yet even these advanced rates are much
helow those of the railways at the same period,
for, with the freight pressure, the scales slide
up with the same fatal facility on the railways
as on the canal. Had the Erie canal a com-
petitor in another war.er channel of like capa-
city, the same as the New York Central has, its
rival, the scale would naturally be lower and
more stationary. There is a certain point or
circle in the price of transportation by rail
below which railways cannot go, the radius of
