CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

and if so, when a repert might be expected. Mr.
W. i.ajd he desired no war with any foreign
pow«r, much less with such a power as Mexico,-
nor did he think a war would be necessary. If
Congress would do what the French Government
was now doing, send a sufficient squadron to de-
mand instantaneous redress, and, if not granted,
then to blockade the ports of Mexico, redress
would th n be granted, and never till then, but
new insults and injuries would be  accumulated
Mr BUCHANAN (chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations) said that he had no objection
whatever to answer the interrogatory propounded
by the Senator tiom Misses ppi All that he could
object to, if he were disposed to be hypercritical,
was the observations of the Senator preceding the
interrogatory The Senator had given day ind
date, and circumstance, and all connected with the
resolution which the tommittee had reported at the
last regular session of Congress on the subject of
our claim* against Mexico, evidently foi the pur-
pose of showing that our present apparent hstless-
ness was inconsistent with ourformet encrgj This
was not the cuse There was no indisposition on
the part of the committee to make a report on this
subject whenever it might be pioper He could
safely say, that there was not one ol them who felt
disposed to shunk from the responsibility of acting
up to the spun arid letter of the resolution which
they had reported, and which had received the
unanimous sanction of the Senate.
The committee had held a number of informal
consultations on the subject, and had come to the
conclusion that it waspropei to await the action of
the House of Representatives The next •step ne
take, said Mr B. m regard to Mexico, must be
some measure that may directly lead to war, or
war itself, because he thought every honorable
means of conciliation had been exhausted Now
where ou¿ht such a measuie to be introduced'' We
have, said he, examined the public archives, and
find that from the origin of the Government to the
present day, no such measure has originated in
the Senate Coercive measures had always ori-
ginated with the immediate íepresentatives of the
people, not«ertainly for the want of constitutional
power m the Senate, but most probably because
the House of Representatives emanated more im-
mediately from, and were more directly responsible
10, the jeople, who must bear the burdens of war,
and under the Constitution, the House alone could
originate the revenue bills without which warcoukl
not be pios-ecutcd
He had matte it his business to inquire of the
chati man of the Committee on Foieign Relations
oí the House, and had been informed by that gen-
tleman that the committee had then the subject un-
d r their most serious consideration, and might be
expected to come to some conclusion upoa it
within a few days Under these circumstances,
the committee of the Senate, were of opinion that
they ought, at the very least, to wait a reasonable
time, for the purpose of affording the popular
branch of the Legislature an opportunity of ex-
pressing their opinion This delay was rendered
more proper from the consideraron, that whilst the .
Senate, at the last regular session, had adopted the
resolution reported by their Committee on Foreign
Relations, the House had not then expressed any
opinion on the subject The leport oí their com-
mittee had not been acted upon
Such, said Mr B are the feelings and impres-
sions of the Committee on Foreign Relations If
he had mistaken them, the Senator from Kentucky,
[Mr Clay,] whom he obsened in his place, could
(orrect him
Mr CLAY of Kentucky said the Senator from
Pennsylvania had stated (orrectly what had occur-
red, and he perfectly agreed with him that the pro-
per course was to leave the matter to the direction
of the House of Representatives—the popular
branch of the National Legislature. The present
embarrassed state of the Treasury, which had been
so feelingly alluded to by Senators on other occa-
sions, and the present distracted state of the cur-
rency, should prevent, at least for the present, any
resort to belligerent step,s. While up, he would
ask a question which probably the Senator from
Mississippi could answer.    He (Mr. C ) had been
informed, but he hoped incorr«etly, that the Minis-
ter Plenipotentiary from the United States, although
appointed last winter one year, had never vet
. reached Mexico. An American citizen, residing
in that city, had told him that the Minister had not
arrived when ha left Mexico, He (Mr C ) would
like to ascertain the fact, and learn where the Mi-
nister had been, and when he would be likely to
reach there, &c.
Mr. WALKER said, m reply to the question
propounded to him by the Senator from Kentucky,
[Mr Cuy] that our Minister to Mexico, he be-
lieved, was still it) this country, but his nomination
was contingent, and the contingency had not oc-
curred upon which our Minister could depart for
Mexico Mr W would say one word m answer
to the Senator from Pennsylvania, [Mr Buchanan ]
He could not agiee that the Senate could with
propriety delay to act upon this subject until
the House acted, but if it was our duty to
wait a reasonable period, that period has long
since elapsed The Senate had the same con-
stitutional power as the House, it was con-
ceded, to originate even a declaration of war.
The Senate represents the States in their sove-
reign capacity, and is the honor of these States
less dear to the Senate than it is to the House of
Representatives? and if the House, as I do not in-
tend now to intimate, should delay or refuse to ori-
ginate the necessary measures to vindicate the Na-
tional honor, must the Senate submit, and refuse to
exercise their constitutional power, in regard to
a subject over which the Constitution gives the same
power to the Senate as to the House of Rep-e-
sentatives'' If the Senate is bound to wait the
action of the House on such a subject, would
it not, on the same principles, be bound to adopt
the opinions of the House when it did act, however
different might be the views of this body1? Mr
W said he was unwilling to place the Senate in
any such humiliating attitude Why have a Con-
mttlee of Foreign Relations of the SenatP, if, as
regards the most important of these relations, we
are to wait and abide by the action of the House of
Representatives'? The Senate was, with the Presi-
dent, the sole treaty-making, as well as on these
subjects, an equal and eo-ordmate branch of the
law-making power, and whenever a proper case oc-
curs for the exercise of the powers confided to us
by the Constitution, our constitutional duties are
measured by ota constitutional powers, and it is
no excuse for delay oi inaction on our part that the
House d«lays or refuses to act upon a sub-
ject m regaid to which the powers of both
Houses are admitted to be equal In re-
lation to the pecuniary claims of our citi-
zens against Mexico, it was, however just those
claims might be, entirely unimportant, when com-
pared to the actual outrages committed by that Go-
vernment upon oui flag and our citizens. Some
gentlemen seemed to think that the late attack
upon the Columbia is ihe first instance of the kind
that has occui red. Why, sir, said Mr W there
are at least half a dozen cases of insults to our flag,
and direct violence previously committed upon our
citizens by Mexico, equally as atrocious as the case
Of the Columbia; and if the nation does not speedily
irrteipose to protect its honor, it will be regarded
as having no honor to protect, and thus invite ag-
gressions from other powers
Mr CLAY of Kentucky deprecated the discus-
sion as irregular and out of place Nevertheless,
he felt it due to himself, as a member of the Com-
mittee of Foreign Relations, and due to the Senate
and to the country, to say, that while there was
strong ground of complaint against Mexico, if we
looked to the correspondence that had taken place
on this subject, we would find that on our part
there was much cause for deep and serious regret
What were the facts m the case? A Mr. Green-
how, a clerk 10 one of the public offices, was de-
spatched to Mexico with a large mass of documents,
containing the claims of our citizens, which were
to le examined and reported on within ten days, or
Mr. Greenhow was to return. Now those at all
acquainted with the manner of doing business in
the public offices, must know that it would have
been impossible to have carefully examined then*
in so many weeks.   The Minister for Foreign Af-
fairs of Mexico proceeded to take up these docu-
ments, and examine them one by one, admitting
the justice of some, and rejecting others, and while
these matters were still in progress, suddenly the
whole subject is thiown upon Cosgress, the Presi-
dent telling that body he had no furthei negotiations
to make with Mexico.
Whenever a clear case was made out, he [Mr.
C ] was ready to enforce on Mexico what wa  due
to law and justice No man was more ready, nor
more willing, than himself to do all that was neces-
sary to sustain the honor and digrtity of the nation,
and to exact from others reparation far all wrongs
that our citizens may have been madejto suffer.
While he would go thus fa , he could not help say-
ing, and all who looked to the correspondence must
admit the truth, that the want of dignity and the
want of temper that had been manifested by per-
sons connected with the Government in relation to
this whole mattei, was greatly to be deplored
Mr BUCHANAN said that although this debate
wa> entirely irregular, it had become necessary for
him to say something more on the subject, even in
regard to the remarks of his colleague on the com-
mittee, who had just addressed the Senate, [Mr.
Clay]
Our complaints against Mexico were of a two-
fold character. The Government oí that country
had not only refused to pay the just claims oí our
injured citizens, but, in seveialmstances, had as-
sailed our national honor, and insulted our national
flag. For assaults and injuries of this description,
pecuniary redress had never been demanded, and
could never be accepted No suitable explanation
of these msulis had ever been given, and no satis-
faction had ever been rendered, although often de-
manded. The remarks of the Senator fr«m Ken-
tucky had not touched this part of the case. A
gross insult had recently been offered to the Ameri-
can flag, of a character requiring the most prompt
and effectual redress, if we were to credit the
siatement published in the New Orleans papers
which had lately reached this city It appeared
that a steamboat, under the American flag, pursu-
ing her lawful commerce in our own sea, had been
repeatedly fired upon and brought to by two Mex-
ican vessels of war In this situation, the engineer
let the steam escape, and the noise so terrified these
Mexican heroes, that they fell flat on their faces on
the decks of their vessels, and the steamboat was
thus suffered to escape Such was the account of
this affair, given in the New Orleans Bee, and
signed by the passengers in the steamboat, several
of whom were known to bt gentlemen of respecta-
bility by members oí the Senate
Mr B said he could present to the Senate, if
this were the proper occasion, a number of other
cases m which the honor of the American flag had
been violated by Mexican officers with perfect im-
punity. He believed that the Senator from Ken-
tucky would be as unwilling as any other man to
suffer these insults to be passed over without any
redress.
In regard to the claims of American citizens
upon the Mexican Govt rnmtnt for pecuniar, re-
dress, which had been spoken of by the Senator
from Kentucky, the Mexican Secretary of Stats
had pursued a most absurd course, but whether by
design or accident, he would not at present express
an opinion After repeated and unavailing at-
tempts had been made to obtain satisfaction for
these claims, a solemn and formal demand was
made upon the Mexican Government for redress,
in July last, by our Secretary of State, in obedience
to the stipulauons of the treaty' A list of these
claims was presented to the Mexican S°cetary, by
Mr Greenough, a special agent appointed for this
purpose, verified by competent proof This, under
the treaty, was a necessary preliminary to war or
repnsals. All these claims had been examined by
our Secretary of State, and none were presented
which, in his opinion, were not founded upon jus-
tice Now what course had the Mexican Secretaiy
adopted'2 Jle had obtained possession, in some
unaccountable manner, of a copy of the printed list
of all. the claims, good, bad, and indifferent, in
which this Government had ever been asked by
mqUviduals to interpose, and which had been trans-
mitted to CongKss on a former occasion by General
