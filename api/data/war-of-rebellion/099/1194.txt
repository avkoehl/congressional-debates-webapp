General HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Dispatch of to-day received, containing President's dispatch. * I have far from sufficient force to hold the enemy in check in the field. He is at this moment investing Columbia with his four corps (as reported) on the south side of Congaree. Hence I see no good reason for deviating from the plan already decided upon; on the country, I urge its immediate execution.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Send here soon as practicable 1,000,000 rounds small-arms ammunition and 2,500 rounds 12-pounder Napoleon.

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,Augusta, February 15, 1865.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Columbia, S. C.:

GENERAL: General Cheatham's corps left this morning with Palmer's battalion artillery. The larger part of Stewart's corps has reached here and will move pursuant to your orders as soon as it can be put in condition to do so. It will muster only 1,000 effectives. The whole command is in a bad condition. Ferguson has been directed by General Hill to take position on Brier Creek and Iverson has been moved over the river. No news from the West. The enemy seems to have gone from our immediate front.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
