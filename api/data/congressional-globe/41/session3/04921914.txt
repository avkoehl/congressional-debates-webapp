The question was on agreeing to the report
of the committee ou conference.
Mr. GARF-1-ELDj of Ohio. I desire to ask
the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. beajian]
how much money can be taken out of the Fed-
eral Treasury and paid to this company for
raising their bridge?
Mr. BBAMAN. Just such sum as the court
of the United States for the southern district
of Ohio, or the Supreme Court of the United
States, on the appeal, shall determine that the
company is entitled to ; provided that the
court shall determine that any sum whatever
shall be paid to the company.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Is there any
limitation to the amount that may be so
allowed ?
Mr. BEAMAN. No ; there is no limitation
at all.
Mr. BINGHAM. Why should there beany
limitation by Congress to a future judgment of
the court?
Mr. ARCHER. What was the estimate of
the War Department?
Mr. STEVENSON. I can answer the gen-
tleman.
Mr. BEAMAN. I think it was $280,000.
Mr. STEVENSON. It was $288,000.
Mr. JONES, of Kentucky. I desire to ask
a question. I understand that this portion of
the report on this bill relating to the Newport
bridge is the result of an understanding or
compromise between those who are in favor
of ths bridge and those who are against it ;
that, so far as they are concerned, they have
agieed that this report shall be adopted.
Mr. BEAMAN. Yes, sir; I may state that
this is entirely satisfactory, so far as I can
learn, both to the bridge interest and to the
river interest. I now call the previous ques-
tion.
The previous question was seconded and_
the main question ordered ; and under the
operation thereof the report of the committee
of conference was agreed to.
Mr. BE A11AN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the report was agreed to ; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.

Mr. LOGAN. I ask unanimous consent
to have tak&n from the Speaker's table and i
passed Senate bill No. 1271, to amend an act
for the relief of Jearum. Atkins, approved July
15, 1870.
Mr. COX. I object if it is not a report of
a committee of conference.
Mr. LOGAN. Let the bill be read. It is
merely to correct a word in a patent. The bill
passed the House at the last session and failed
in the Senate. It has now passed the Senate
and it comes to the House. Let it be read.
rfhe bill was read. It proposes to amend
the act entitled "An act for the relief of Jearum
Atkins," approved July 15,1870, so as to read
as follows:
That the Commissioner of Patents be, and he
hereby is, authorized to entertain and exercisc juris-
diction over a petition of Jearum Atkins for the
extension of letters-patent granted to him on the
21st day of December, 1852, for a further term of
seven years from the day on which such extension
maybe granted, and to hear and determine upon
the said petition in the same manner and with the
sameeffectas if the original teirn ot said patent had
not expired, and to grant, or refuse such extension
upon the same principles that govern his decisions
upon such applications when made in due course of
law: Provided. That before granting any extension
upon such petition the Commissioner shall be satis-
fied that the same will inure to the sole benefit of
said Atkins: And provided further, That no person
shall be held liable for the infringement of said
patent, if extended, for making use of said invention
since the expiration of the original term of said
patent, and prior to the date of its extension.
Mr. COX. I understand that the only cor-
rection is to change 641st of December" to
" 21stof December."
Mr. LOGAN. That is all.
Mr. COX. I will not object.
No objection being made, the bill was
taken from the Speaker's table, read a first
and second time, ordered to a third reading,
read the third time, and passed.
Mr. LOGAN moved to reconsider the vote
