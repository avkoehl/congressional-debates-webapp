EDENBURG,

December 21, 1863..

CAPTAIN: Rosser's brigade is trying to cross the river to intercept us at Front Royal. Fitz. Lee's brigade of cavalry and Early's division of infantry is close after us in the rear. I think we have a good start and can keep ahead.

HEADQUARTERS VALLEY EXPEDITION,Strasburg, December 22, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report my arrival at this place to-day. I proceeded up the valley as directed, reaching Sparta on the 19th, and entering Harrisonburg with the cavalry. I reached there the 20th with the infantry. We found nothing in the way but O'Ferrall's battalion, most of which was captured at different times.

At New Market I found a dispatch from O'Ferrall, directed to General Fitz. Lee, which gave me my first intimation that he was in the valley. Two of the prisoners taken there belonged to General Rosser's brigade. They stated that they had come home on furlough, but that when they left the brigade was under marching orders for the valley. Before reaching Sparta, I received information from various sources leaving no doubt in my mind that the brigade was than near Ashby's Gap, intending to cross in my rear. I relied on the high water to prevent this and kept on.

On the 20th, two deserters from his brigade came in, who reported the brigade as awaiting for the river to fall. The men swam the river, reported it then too deep for fording, but falling rapidly. On reaching Harrisonburg, I learned that Fitz. Lee had crossed on Friday with his brigade and some additional force, and that he and Imboden were trying to intercept Averell, who it was reported had completed his raid, burning the depot and tearing up the track at Salem, and had made good his return, eluding the forces sent in his pursuit. I also learned that Early's division had been in the valley
