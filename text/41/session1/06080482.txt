THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 3,
that it should not be left to rest upon clauses
in appropriation bills.
I will have this table printed in the Globe
with my remarks, and I will state, ia explan-
ation of it, that there are two columns in it.
One is headed " Number specifically provided
by law," aud this gives the number of em-
ployes authorized by the acts organizing or
relating to the organization of the Treasury
Department. The next column ia headed
'"Number employed and paid by virtue of
law." That is the way it is stated at the
Treasury Department. It is by virtue of pro-
visions in appropriation bills, but not in any
organic act.
[Here the hammer fell.]
The following is the table referred to by Mr.
Lawrexce :

Mr. DAWES. For very many years there
hag been an appropriation in these terms,
varying greatly, however, in the amount of the
appropriation in different years. It is an ap-
propriation for what is called the Secretary's
personal staff. That is to say, it is for the
employment of persons for different and specific
purposes for dififerentand uncertain times, and
neither the time or the compensation can be
'fixed by law. Three years ago there was asked
'■$280,000—$180,000 to pay extra compensa-
tion to clerks generally in the discretion of
the Secretary, and $100,000 for the employ-
ment of clerks—and that sum was given. Two
years ago the sanaesum was asked, and$100,000
was given for temporary clerks at just and rea-
sonable rates of compensation, in the words
of this appropriation. Then there was asked
an additional sum of $50,000 for the same
purpose, making in sill 5150,000; but that
was not granted by Congress. The present
Secretary, instead of that large sum, asks for
an appropriation of $35,000 solely for the pur-
pose of employing those clerks at special duty
and on extra occasions which the exigencies
of the service require. It is for services not
provided for by law and the compensation for
which is not fixed by law. To adopt the
amendment of the gentleman from Ohio would,
therefore, be equivalent to saying that the
Secretary shall not have the $35,000.
The amendment was rejected.
The Clerk read as follows :
For salaries and expenses of collectors, assessors,
assistant assessors, supervisors, and detectives, to-
gether with the expenses of carrying into effect the
various provisions of the several acts providing
f«eS2UoeooeonU°'eXCePtin8itemSl>therW1SePrOTilled
Mr. COBURN. I move to strike out the
paragraph just read, for the reason that in my

opinion it is too uncertain and too indefinite.
The large amount of §2,000,000 is here asked
to be appropriated for purposes which no mem-
ber of this House can understand, or even U-^in
to understand, from the language of this ciau it-.
It does seem to me that if we are to appropri-
ate this large amount of money we utnjht to
know something about what it is for. it su\
for salaries and expenses of collectors, assiAs-
ors, assistant assessors, supervisors, and de-
tectives." Now, how much of this ,i?2,0u0.000
is for salaries, and how much is for detectives ?
The very next clause of the bill is "for detect-
ing and bringing to trial and punishment per-
sons guilty of violating the internal revenue
laws," and §50,000 is appropriated for that
purpose; yet in the clause now under consid-
eration we are asked to make an indefinite
appropriation to cover the expenses and pay
of these detectives.
If we make this appropriation of this large
sum let us have specific items showing what
is for salaries in round numbers, then what is
to be expended for expenses outside of sala-
ries, how much for salaries of collectors, how
much for salaries of assessors, and how much
for salaries of assistant assessors—these mat
ters certainly can be calculated or approx-
imated—and how much for salaries of super-
visors, and how much for salaries of detectives.
Then the paragraph goes on to say, ' •' together
with the expenses of carrying into effect the
various provisions of the several acts providing
internal revenue." What does that mean?
To what does it refer? For what purpose is
it? lor pay of officers, or for pay of detect-
ives? How much of the $2,000,000 is to be
used for this purpose ? One million, or half a
million, a quarter of a million, or a hundred
thousand dollars? No man can tell. The
Committee of the Whole is certainly entitled
to know when a large appropriation of this kind
is made for what purposes it is to be used.
"Excepting items otherwise provided for."
What does that mean? Now, it may be said
that it is utterly impossible for the committee
to put down in black and white the various
items for which this appropriation is to be
expended. That can hardly be so, for in a
previous portion of this bill we have the various
items in detail—one for $3,000, another ior
$10,000, and so on. Yet we are here called
upon, in a paragraph of five printed lines,
by a miscellaneous provision to appropriate
$2,000,000.
I say that we should strike out all these
indefinite items, or until our committees can
report specifically or approximately what the
appropriation is for we should vote themdowu.
[Here the"hammer fell.]
Mr. BECK. The report of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue gives every item the gen-
tleman from Indiana [Mr. Coburn] desires.
Mr. DAWES. The reason why this $2,000,
000 is asked for in this form is this: it has been
found that it costs $8,000,000 to collect the
internal revenue. The first appropriation for
that purpose, made three years ago, was for
$10,000,000. When the year closed it was
found that there was a surplus of $2,000,000.
The next year $6,000,000 was appropriated for
that purpose, which with the $2,000,000 leit,
over from the year before made the $8,000,000
necessary for that year. But when the appro-
priation came to be made last year, instead of
$8,000,000 it was made $6,000,000, the same
as the year before. Now, as there was no sur-
plus $2,000,000, as was the case the year be-
fore, this appropriation is necessary to supply
what was simply an oversight, in order to give
the department of internal revenue precisely
what it was allowed for the three preceding
years.
Although the necessities of the service have
increased, yet by a due regard for economy
the department has been enabled to administer
that office so as to keep the aggregate of its
expenditures within the original limit. And
it is only for the purpose I have indicated that
it is now proposed to appropriate the sum
named in this clause. Now, in ordsr tli.it
