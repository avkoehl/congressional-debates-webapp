NASHVILLE, October 2, 1863.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga:

Owing to the great delay in getting transportation for even wagons and mules, I suggest that when the troops arrive at Bridgeport they use the wagons of the supply trains if they are to move farther at once. When the road is once clear of troops, the supplies will be pushed through rapidly. I have requested Captain Jenkins to send small-stores, such as rope, &amp;c., in a baggage-car by passenger train. Plenty of axes, hatchets, &c., at Stevenson and Bridgeport. The clothing, &c., is all packed and ready for shipment. The moment cars can be had this will go forward. I have made arrangements for a full supply of everything we shall require. The railroad can be put in running order in a short time after the country is cleared. Thirty carpenters additional on to boat at Bridgeport [sic].

HENRY C. HODGES.

FOURTEEN MILES FROM BRIDGEPORT, October 2, 1863-9.30 a.m.

General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

In consequence of storm and other delays, made only 2 miles progress yesterday. Am doing well this morning, and office will be at foot of mountain 7 miles from here to-night. Officers tell me it will be impossible to go up the mountain by the Haley road, but I shall try.

Respectfully,

J. C. VAN DUZER.

Colonel GODDARD:

The three wires running from Nashville to Louisville are cut between Elizabethtown and Munfordville. The train coming south has been detained north of the break of the telegraph-line, for what purpose is not ascertained.

Respectfully,

C. HOLDRIDGE.

WALDEN'S RIDGE, October 2, 1863-6.45 a.m.

Captain MERRILL:

Our horses have had nothing since the morning of the 28th. Cannot get our team nearer than 3 miles of here, to which place we have to go for water. What shall we do?

BERRY,

Acting Signal Officer.
