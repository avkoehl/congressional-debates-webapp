The Middle Department, compromising the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware, and the Department of Virginia, have been the scene of important operations, concerning which detailed reports have not been made by the commanding generals to this Department. Your knowledge of the character and result of these operations dispenses with the necessity for any review until the final reports are made. The preliminary reports of Major-General McClellan of the battle before Richmond and of the battles of Antietam and South Mountain, and the report of the General-in-Chief are submitted.* The communications between this Department and the respective commanders were prepared under a resolution of the Senate at the last session, and will be transmitted to Congress whenever you shall be pleased to give your sanction.

The report of General Halleck, the General-in-Chief, exhibits the operations in these departments since the 23rd of July, the date at which, under your order, he assumed command of all the armies of the United States. If he campaigns of the armies in these departments have not equaled in their results the exceptations of the Government and the public hope, still they have not been unproductive of good result. The valor of our troops has been displayed upon many occasions, and the skill and gallantry of their officers have been distinguished at Yorktown, Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Gaines" Mill, Malvern Hill, Cross Keys, Cedar Mountain, Chantilly, and other places enumerated in the reports herewith submitted. The invading any which recently threatened the capital and the borders of Maryland and Pennsylvania has been driven back beyond the Rappahannock; Norfolk, captured by Major- General Wool, is in our possession; Suffolk and Yorktown are held; a strong army corps, under its vigilant and efficient commander, Major-General Dix, at Fortress Monroe, threatens and harasses the enemy; and, what is especially gratifying, it has been proved that the loyalty of the State of Maryland cannot be shaken even by the presence of a rebel army.

The official reports received at this Department show that the military operations in the West during the past year have been both active and successful. The beginning of last winter found the rebel armies of Price and McCulloch in possession of all the northwestern portion of Missouri, while many of the counties north of the Missouri River were in a state of insurrection. Our forces were concentrated at Rolla and Sedalia. As soon as the rebels could be driven from the northern counties and our armies reorganized active operations were commenced, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season and the bad condition of the roads. On the 18th of December a considerable number of the enemy were cut off and captured at Milford while on their way to join Price on the Osage River. The forces at Rolla under General Curtis moved toward Springfield, which compelled Price to fall back into Arkansas, where he has joined by Van Dorn. A severe battle was fought at Pea Ridge, Ark., on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of March between the combined armies of the enemy and General Curtis" force, in which the latter gained a complete and decisive victory.

The gun-boats, under Flag Officer Foote, and the troops at Cairo, under General Grant, moved up the Tennessee River for the reduction of Forts Henry and Donelson. While Grant's troops were marching to surround the former place it was attacked by the gun- boats and
