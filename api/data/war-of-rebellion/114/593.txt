is violated. I certainly do not think them perfectly safe here considering the population by which they are surrounded and the opportunities for evading the vigilance of their guards.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 5, 1861.

Respectfully referred to the general commanding with a recommendation that the seventeen prisoners referred to by General Dix be transferred to some other place for safe-keeping; and I beg to repeat my suggestion that some other suitable place be selected for keeping prisoners of war that may be captured in future. For present purposes it seems to me that Fort Independence, Boston Harober, of Fort Adams, Newport, might suffice.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,Baltimore, Md., September 5, 1861.

Major General G. B. McCLELLAN,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have received a communication from the mayor* of Baltimore protesting against my order, but informing me that he shall offer no resistance to it and that he will "give public notice to the officers and men of the city police that no further paymensts can be expected by them. "

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,Baltimore, Md, September 8, 1861.

Major General G. McCLELLAN,

Commanding Army of the Potomac.

GENERAL: I came to the city from Fort McHenry to-day to examine a quantity of articles, letters, &amp;c., intended for the Confederate States, captured last evening by the police. Two parties of individuals were also taken with them.

* *

I have all these persons in custody; what shall be done with them? I must again call your attention to the crowded state of Fort McHenry. Every room is full and we had about fifty prisoners last night in tents on the parade ground with hardly room left for the guard to parade. I understand that Fort Delaware cold very promptly and economically be fitted up for 200 prisoners by simply flooring the casemates.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.
