DALTON, November 19, 1864-11.30 p. m.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

I have just received information that Wheeler intends attacking Tunnel Hill to-night or in the morning. The garrison at that post embraces only 200 men. The commanding officer these requests re-enforcements. There is no telegraph office at Tunnel Hill, but will send an operator from here to open one to-night. I am convinced Wheeler is in the vicinity. Have not mounted men to keep myself advised as I wish to.
