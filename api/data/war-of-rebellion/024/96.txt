it was too dark to distinguish one object from another and until one-half of all the men that had been taken upon the line upon the right of the battery were killed or wounded. The battery at the same time, under command of the gallant Lieutenant Sears, held out, if possible, with still greater desperation, firing until all the canister-shot was exhausted and more than one-half of his men and nearly all his horses had been killed or wounded. After this the enemy came upon the ground where it was stationed, but did not remove the battery from the field. The position where the remaining companies of the Twenty-sixth Missouri was left had become very much exposed to the enemy's fire, and the lieutenant-colonel, in his discretion and without orders, removed them to an open field to the right of the Fifth Iowa, and then formed them in order of battle, where thy remained for the night. The enemy making no further appearance on my left, I withdrew the Fourth Minnesota Infantry from that wing and ordered them to move forward and occupy the ground originally occupied by the battery and the left of the Fifth Iowa. They promptly moved forward to within a few yards of this position, when they received a heavy volley of musketry from one of the regiments of the Second Brigade, which caused than to lat and lie down. The regiment occupied this position until 8.15 o'clock, when it was relieved by General Sullivan with one of the regiments of the Second Brigade.

I am happy to report that, with the single exception of the battalion on the left of the battery, each regiment obeyed every order with alacrity, and held every position assigned them until directed to vacate them; ant, in case of the exception above named, I deem it proper to state that the enemy's fire in that position was so severe that veteran troops even could hardly be expected to hold it. The brigade was in order of battle soon after the close of the engagement ready for action on the following morning. Every regiment conducted itself with coolness and deliberation,a nd in no case fired except when the enemy appeared in full view, and then with deliberate aim; but were subjected to four full volleys from regiments of other brigades of our own troops in the rear.

I forward herewith the reports of the commanders of the respective regiments of my brigade, containing full list of casualties of the respective commands. The official report of the Eleventh Ohio Battery will be forwarded at an early day, the only officer able to be on duty since the battle having been constantly engaged in refitting his battery for service.

I regret that, in an action occupying a little more than an hour and a half, there were, out of about 2,100 men of my brigade engaged, 584 killed or wounded and 24 missing.* It will be a consolation to the friends of all know that they died or were injured fighting manfully for their country, and in an engagement where the killed and wounded of the enemy were twice the number of our own.

All the commanding and field officers of regiments and detachments labored with equal zeal and courage to perform their whole duty. Colonels Matthies and Boomer made most extraordinary efforts and with measurable successful results. The former was more fortunate than the latter in being able to continue his efforts tot he close of the engagement. They both deserve from the country the reward that a grateful people are always ready to confer upon faithful servants. Lieutenant L. b. Martin, acting assistant adjutant-general on my staff, conducted himself with great gallantry, and labored incessantly and successfully
