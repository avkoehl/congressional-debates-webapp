I am directed to inform you that all men enlisting or re- enlisting into the Regular Army from the different armies in the field, or from the District of Columbia, will be allowed to select the State, district, township, town, and ward to which they prefer being credited. The localities to which men prefer being credited must be indorsed on their enlistment papers.

Enlistments or re-enlistments into the Regular Army made in the loyal States will be credited to the localities where the enlistments or re-enlistments are made.

OFFICE ACTG. ASST. PROV. March General FOR ILLINOIS, Springfield, March 8, 1864.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to ask if any action is contemplated to check the removal from the State of persons subject to military duty. In view of the near approach of the draft this movement has already begun and is rapidly assuming a serious character.

Captain West lake, provost-marshal, Ninth District, under date of March 7, 1864, says:

At least 1,000 young and able-bodied men intend to leave this district for California, Idaho, and other places, with a view of escaping the draft. * * * The copperheads are the ones who intend to leave. Something should be done to stop them from leaving the State, &amp;c.

Having received similar information from other portions of Illinois, I would respectfully suggest that the matter should receive the early attention of the Government, and measures be taken to arrest this tide of emigration, if practicable, at least until after the draft, or that parties leaving should be made answerable in a proper bond, or otherwise, for their appearance if drafted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES OAKES,

Lieutenant Colonel Fourth U. S. Cavalry, A. A. P. M. G. for Illinois.
