Mr. SMITH. Weil, I will allow the sren'lema"
fiv* minute , if he «i'l promise to move the pre-
vious question at ihe end of ihat time
Mr. CUSHING prom sec!, and proceed =d to ar-
gue that the gent'emai fi\,m Kentucky, [Mr Un-
derwood,] was wrong in stating that ihe ci e of
Newland and Graham was the fiist case of coh
tested eleciion where payment had been made
The first case wa that of EU^ha Potter, Senator
from Rhode is'and, in 1834 An act was pi-s-d
by the Senate for the payment of the mont;, and it
was cone ured in by hr H'>u<e
Mr. UNDERWOOD -aid the case of N wbnd
and Graham was the f'rst ra e where mrney had
been taken from the eon!mg n' fund of the House.
Mr. CUSHING sai i that was a mere matter oe
argument, tbe question was, the fact of paj ment,
and that was sett ed so far ns precedent v   con
cerned. As regarded the question of principle, the
neht of come ' was the right, not ot a number
bimself, but of his conbtituen'b. It -was no' rght
for the House to shut out his constituen s If Was
in that new of the matter that he voted in the case
of Newland and Graaam, Moore and Letcher, the
Mississippi case, and a'so m another case at the
present session. Mr. G. then moved the prcv¡ous
question
Mr. BOTTS consented to modify his re rluton
as follows-
Resolved, That ihe Commnteeon Accounts be in-
structed torepor* by what authority fiey authorised
the Clerk of this House to pay the sum 01
$2160 50 to Charles J. Ingersoli and ctbei«, for
taking testimony and foi oto°r expenses ncurred in
ihe contested eiec ion.
Mr. BRÍGGS then withdrew his ai)endm n\
Tne call for the previous quesmn was then se-
conded, and the mam question on the resolution cr-
dered and decided m tne afli mat ve So t1 ^ reso-
lution was adopted.
Mr. MEDILL then meed t> reco.nM t tne im-
port of the Clerk with the instruct o s p tviously
noticed, wh ch motion was ag eed to and the report
recommittted aceordmg'v.
