D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier General of Volunteers, Comdg. Second Cavalry Div.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the enemy are picketing the ford at Rappahannock Station and Beverly Ford strongly. Fifty persons have been seen at each of those places. Kelly's Ford and Norman's Ford are picketed by a very small force, only 2 vedettes at Norman's Ford and 5 at Kelly's having been observed. The report of Major Avery, forwarded to you last night, shows the condition of the fords above Beverly Ford.

Captain Hughes reports the enemy's main reserve at Brandy Station to consist of one brigade. Horses said to be in low condition.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. IRVIN GREGG,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.
