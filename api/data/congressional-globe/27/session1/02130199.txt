a suspession upon the question of forfeiture If
he agieed with -kch gentlemen as to the effect of a
suspension on the question ot forfeiture of charter,
hs rai^ht come 10 the same conclusion with the Se
nator from South C?rolma as to this amend-
ment
But Mr N. proceeded to «¡ay, that, according to
his opinion, a suspension of specie payments was
ipso fado a forfeiture of the charter whenever pro-
c°edius« houlJ be prostcnted to test the question
The only point with him, then, wis, whether, if a
suspension takes p'ace, and no process is in tttuted
for the violation oí the chirle- until after resump-
tion, such re-sumption would b  finy ground on
which the effect of thesujppnsnn ecu Id be avoided?
He pre=umrd there could be no diference of
opinion on this que tion If the suspension works
a forfei uie, the subsequent resumption, cannot
cure it Ii a scire fanm shoul 1 be issued even
after the resumotion, upon proof of the fact of a
previous suspt nsioii, the court would be bound to
adjudge th,e charier forfu ed How then could
there tie any gro wd for the inference, that by vot-
ing for thij amendment, ues'ou'd recognise the
existence of •J right to suspend, without incurring
the penilt) of for <-uure ot chnrtei? He again pro-
te ted . gimst anv such inference
Mr BkNTON «aid there seemed to be a choice
of two evils presented to Senators, whether to re-
cognise the receivabihty of suspended bank paper
by the Government, or to n cognise the right of the
Bank to suspend payment, and great as cas the
evil and the sc?ndal ot ihe former, he cons dered
the l*t nr lrfimtely greater, and shou d, consequent
ly, vo t rgainst he amendment
Mr CLAY of Alabama was sorry at the diver-
sity of sentiment min fested by his political friends
on this ques'ion His own opinion was, ihat the
adopt on of 'he amendment would bf a recognition
of ihe power in this Ba>-k to make its paper re
ceivaWe or non receivable at it^ pleasure Bat he
hid an ?mendmeiit whin n  would off- r, which
wouid test ir"> que tit *> as to who were the friends
of an irre'eemable bank currency. Mr C then
set th" following amendment to the Chair, which
was re d
" Vn \ such suspension of specie paymen s shall be held
anil a lulgel ipso facto a forfeiture of the charter hereby
gran ed
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky said ths was pushing
things 1.0 ai extreme which he could not sanction,
and would propose to amend it, by striking out all
after the word "adjudged," and inserting "a viola-
tion of the charter "
Mr CLAY of Aiabinia declined to accept the
amendment, and the Ciair decided it was not in
order
Mr WALKER wh d to be inclined whether
¡t was intended that the act of su pension itself
should be a forfeiture or wnether it was to be a
caus- of forfei ute, to be adjuJicated by th* court
Mr CLVYtt Alabama spid be lat'er was his
intention, an 1 he thought was the effect of the lan-
guage he had used in his-am-ndmert, but, to ob-
viate the objec iot of his frierd from Missssippi,
he v. as willing to modify it by irbTin  'by the
co irt "
Tne yeas and na>s having been ordere 1 on the
amendment, it required unan mous consent to mo-
dify it, and
Mr CLiY of Kentucky 'aid there seemed so
little cisposjuoi on the o t"r «i 'e to appreciate or
recipn c-i e courtesy, that he would oDject to the
mo 1 fioi io"
Mr WALKS I h p°d thcScnitor from Ken-
tucky we ' i ni t -p" ist n his objection, which
vould cc noi 1 Scnitors to place themselves m a
fals  po   ti  n on ¡he reord
Mr BUCHANAN hrped that his friends on that
«side of tn° H< u t wou'd net cbj°et to a modinca
tion of the amendment, which he trusted would
meet the concurrence of all sic'es of the chamber
He ¡ opo ed to mrdify it by declir ng to.it a sus
pension oí payment should be hell and adjudged
to be caos* of frrfeiture
Mr CLAY of Kentucky withdrew his objection,
aid
Mr CL\Y of Alaoama accepted the modifica-
tion of his amendment proposed by Mr Buchanan.
The question was then taken on the amendment

Mr CLAY of Alabama said he felt encouraged
from the good success of his last effort, to make
another, and h  would propose an amendment,
which he thought would be equally act pa It
with the last It «as a provision taken frini ih->
act of 1836, regulating the deposite banks which
declared the discontinuance cf any bank ¿s a
depositary which should suspend payment Mr
C then sent his amendment to the Chair, and it was
in substance to amend the 16 h section of the bill
which declares that the pub ic money shall be de-
posited in the Bank and branches, providing lhat it
the Bank fail or refuse to discharge any of its du-
ties, in the collection, safe-keeping and disburse-
ment of the public revenue, or to pay#ts no e> m
specie, then the Secretary of the Treasury shall
cease to deposite in the Bank, and shall report the
fact immedia ely to Congress, if in session, and if
not, at the commencement of the next session
thereafter, and it sha!' be lawful for hm to mike
the deposi'es m fr  mean time, in any State bank,
according to the provisions o* the Deposite Act of
1836, and in cr se of refusal oy the banks to receive
it, then to be kepi b/ ihe Secret-iry in tie be-4 man-
ner, until o her provision is made
Mr CL4Y of Kentucky objected to thi=, tint it
put the poser over the public money into the
hands of the Execu ive, and this he ne er would
consent to v th the rerrenbrince of the formf r
gross abose o that pj tec m th remov ¡tin* >'e

Mr CL4Y of A ibama -skrd if the Sma or
from Kentucky did  not vote in 1836 for the N 1
vegulating the d pos t  banks which contained tm
very provision
Mr CLAY said the only reason of bis voting f r
that bill was, that it contained the provi ions to
distribute the surp us 'evenue pmong the cever )
States
Mr CLA.Y of Alabama sad the pr nciple w„ 
not then so ob oxious to the Senator from Ken-
ticky as io overba'ance his partiality for a"oihtr
measure wi h which it was connected
But flits amendment vests no discretion in the
Executive. It direc s ihe Secre ary on the occur-
rence of a given state of facts, to perform cei'a n

show that he was nof in favor of ixt«nJing Execu-

its passage would have been to place the whole
treasure of the nation m the unrestricted power of
thp Executive Was the union of the purse a«d
the sword so dangerous m the hands of Gen Jack-
so1, and not dangerous in the hands of President
Harr son? The gentlemen saw no danger in vest-
ing this power in the PiesideM (hen, and he could
see no reason *"or their opposing it now. Hecou'd
suppose a c?se m which the exercise of this power
would be loudly called for. Suppose we had a
Secretary of the Treasury who was in collusion
with a ro.ten and fraudulent banking cjneern,
who would transfer the funds of the country to the
enemies of the country—should not the Executive
have the power of removal?
Mr WOODBURY thought a be ter way to effect
the obje"t of me Senator from Alabama was to
amend the 16th sec ion < f the charter by inserting
'hr wc-do ' unless it should suspend specie pay-
ment "
Mr SEVIER wished the Senator from Kentucky
to info m h m «hit the Government would do m
case of a su pennon. It could not receive their
no es m payment, and what would be done with
the deposite 1
Mr CLAY of Kentucky said, if the Bank sus-
pended, the Government would share the fate of
the private deposi or«, and the subsequent receipts
into the Treasury cou'd be made a special depo-
site
Mr SEVIER ¿sked where was the authority in
that bill to the Secretary to make special deposites?
The law is expl ctt, "he shall deposite," &c and
allows him no discretion. Are we, then, to pass a
law which w U compel the Secretary of the Trea-
sury to deposi e the revenue, for nine months, in
th  vaults of a bro ¡en bank, whose notes are not
taken in pa\mert'
Mr CLIY said, f ve were to leg slate on mere
poss b li'ie , v. e could go en adin/liufutn. For his
own par', sooner than countename the system of
Eieeut ve interference with the Treasury, he would
prefer to losa the entire amount of the public mo-
ney in the vaults of the Bank.
Mr. BUCHAINAN said he was as much op-
prsed as the Senator from Kentucky was to piling
Pelion upon Ossa, but the Senate had, by a unani-
mous vo'e, declared agam't the reception of the
notes of th Batik while in a state of suspension,
and why «hould we dpposite the moneys of the Go-
vernmentm her vaults, when her notes were not
received1
Mr CLAY of Alabama said, m reply to the Se-
nator from JNtw Hampshire, [Mr. Woodbury,]
there wee van us other causes besides suspen-
sion, \ h c'i might render the removalof the depo-
sitas proper, as a refusal to pay pensioners, &c.
« men the amendment proposed by him would not
cover
Mr CLAY rf Kentucky said if gentlemen re-
a"y wi lied to atuin the object which they pro-
fesse 1 to h xve so much at heart, he would submit
ar> sx- e">lspent which would accomplish it. Mr.
C sent the amendment to the Chair, which was in
sub t-nee as 'clo\s < Tnat if any suspension
snoi'd ta'pp1 c- during the recess of Congress,
ihen ht becretaiy of >-e Treasury was to have
pewer to make snc'i tempt rary disposition of the

prov is c n that 11 %H be adopted, something would
neoe anly have to be ¡eit to the di&ereuon of the
Ex"cut ve
Mr CL4.Y of Alabama then moved to so amend
the bill as to strike out twelve per cent, which the
Bank «as held responsible for during a state of
suspension and h >ert twefltj-ñve per cen'.
IVJr SEVIER hot ei the amendment would be
