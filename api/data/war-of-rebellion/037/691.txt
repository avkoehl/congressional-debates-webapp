Major: Yesterday morning, at about 3. 30 a. m. the enemy opened a heavy artillery fire on my lines, continuing about one hour. at 6 o'clock one of the enemy's guns opened on the 32-pounder on my extreme right, to which it replied; but, owing to some deficiency in the carriage, it fired but a few shots. Everything unusually quiet during the remainder of the day. About 10 p. m. last night, I moved a portion of Major Stevens' command on the line occupied by the Mississippi State troops, considerably strengthening that part of the line, but it is not yet strong enough on the extreme right. One wounded, sixtieth Tennessee; one wounded (Mississippi States troops), in town.

Very respectfully,

JNumber C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.

Major J. G. DEVEREUX,
