APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 1840.
á&JTH Cong""2nd Sess.
Pre-emption Law—Mr, Anderson,
Senate.
HUtolveJ, the puhcy of our law, as well as that
more recent act of this august body, was doubt ess
founded upon the very rational presumption that
foreigners who «eek an asylum, in our country
would come as the natural enemies of tyranny I
am not unmindful of what I cay. Trie priocip'e
which embraces the one completely covers tiie other.
It is in vain to refer to poor, unhappy, dismember
ed, prostrate, and ruined Poland, rent asunder and
trampled in the dust by the Autocrat of Rustía, as
sending forth upon us higher claim , in the persons
of her exiles, than other emigrants from every op-
pressive despotism of Europe Nor do I agree vs nh
the suggestion made, that emigrant foreigners, who
find here our outstretched arnis, secretly retain their
early prejudices in favor of kings, and princes
This might apply to the tided exile, but not t > th't
laborer who fled to us for the protection ol our
laws, and the enjoyment of our liberties He has
no sympathy v ith power The iron of resistance
and of hatred has entered deep into his hea't egamst
the titular nobleman before whom he was com
pelled to bow, and against that king who had mlcd
aim with a despot's rud. From the moment that
he set his foot upon your shore1-, and beheld that
t glorious banner that waves above the dome of this
Capitol, his allegiance to the land of his adoptioi
entered into his heart, as a fixed prmcip'e, faithfully
and forever, and whsn he ftlls the flist uee of the
far West, and treads upon the soil he can proudly
call his own, an invading foe could only strike
down the standard cf libeity by pacing ovei his
dead or dying bony.
Sir, why should not such men as those, as ihey
have for more than forty years, mingle m the pu
chase of your lands, and if we could vote a town-
ship of land to the exiles of Poland, at a en di of
ten years, and the lowest pr ce, why not let our
own countrymen enter tne land for prorrpt p y
menf? Why, too, sir, should we for the fint time
introduce odious exceptu ns in inference to aliens,
never resoited to in all oui legi litio  upon this
subject? Sir, the poor ct eveiy land aie the «ame
They are the lover of liberty wh< rever jou fin i
them, beciuse the y have be n made to taste the
bi ter cup of degradation Yoii h?/e nothing to
fear fiom such men' Such weie the sues of
that population which filled i ur victorious aitnies
in the Revolutionary •rtrusg'e But, sir, wevoed
lo the French teltlers four townships of Ian 1, at a
credit of fourteen year1;, for the m nimuii price,
without exacting any condition oí naiu'ali/diion
The possession ar d occupancy ot land seems to
imply in our legislation that this act will follow m
a matter of choice en the rait of the in'ividua'
Any interpositun at thu d ij is obviously unne-
cessary, when no inconvenience has ever ansen
from the present state i f our law s
The importance uh ch las been fivrn to this
part of the subject, has induced me to call >1 e sí-
tennos of the feenate to the -<pec al legisliuon wh ch
we have made in those cases, wuheut deeming it
necessary to al er our general rules, m the iliahtest
particular Sir, I am fully sensible of what m^y
be said for Poland, t e country of Kk sciuslto alld
of Pulaski—a countiy wh ch seemed destined, at
one period of her histoiy, to take the lead of all the
continent of Euripe n ihe man hoi the n(*ht of
sufT age, and the equal ty of liberty, whe n hi r t',ree
hundred thousand men we e a s mb'ed on the
plains of Warsaw, and the negati e of a iinpie n
dividual would have decided the power of nsr ruler
I never can forget she nab a hero «hose bonts
sleep in this land, consecrated by bis blood, and,
sir, I should, if I had had t>>e honor of a seat upon
this floor Ihen, received the pershiag exiles from
her ruin with a generoas heart and an open hand
Bat, sir, lo what despo'r-m in Europe can you not
turn and behold like oppie sions, and when the
victim who has long wtiihtd beneath the tyrant's
grasp escapes tothn happy land will you begin now
for the first time, to dojUhis ii)centy,aEd to place
him under hitherto unknown exception ?
Sir, for one, in the «ense m which all our institu
tions have been a proclamation to the world, and
m conformity with your ¡org established poaeyfif
the silence of the law m relation to al ens be a like
proclamation, let them come and mirgie with our
people, and partake of the joys and the brings of
liberty The only impress of despot sm they will
bring with them, will be that ha'red of it «hich has
been indelibly stamped up n their hearts It is
now too late, with our success and our experience,
and the past sanctions of our laa, to enter upon
the first set of pioscnp ion of the foreign emi
giant
Mr President, I regretted exceedingly to hear it
intimated upon this floor, by some of those who be-
long to the recently triumphant party, that the set-
tlors upon the public lands ought to be removed by
force Itn true, sir, that m some sense they are
trespassers, but without disturbing the public peace
By the very act of occupancy which has been here
denounced, they add to the value of our national
doma n If the design of su h settlement was to
prepare the way for asking the land as a gift, there
would be some plausibility for the denunciation
But thí first wi*h and the highest expectation cf the
settler is to become the purchaser. It is m the very
philosophy of things, in a country like ours, whose
free institutions awaken and bear up the spirit cf
aspiration from the humble hut, as well as the
lofty palace, that the poor man, surrounded
by his wife and his childien, and animated
by a holy love of those endeared objects, with
a pure conscience and a resolved purpose,
relying upon his own unassisted arm, should go
forth to the wilds of the far West to impnve
his fortunes, and confirm his peisonal independ-
ence Hj meets, there, men like himself, who hav 
entered upon that new experiment with the same
ardent hopes and lively expectations A corrmoa
lot and common sufferings, baid these settleis to
gtthcr, and they lovt each other next to th ise whe m
God hith specially committed to the ir charge'
Such, sir, are the men whom it is propos-d to d ive
from their homes' Whence, s r, ard wbuher,
would you march an aimy? What part ot the
broad terntorv of the West woul 1 it traverse in or
i't to reach th" point of attack? I tf 11 ycu public
opinion wou'd drive back your cohorts, and the
man who should attempt such a i™ea ure is not so
high but that sa tie publ c op nion would diag him
lo the dus.t with scorn  nl i idionat oi ' My
friend from Missouri [Mr Li-jn] was right—th'
deed can nevei be done '
Mr President, there was another vic-v of this
sulj ct tiken by gentlemen on the oth r side «nh
which I do not concur It h is been sa d th it lhcre
was no danger to be ->pprehended on our ex ended
Western frontier The twenty six thou«and In
dian warriors whom our policy has ¿«scmblíd
time, it Ins been aid, are perfectly harmless and
tha*, ínslea I of directing their aims against u?, th y
will sweep Ol firma This his been said in an-
swer to the arguiiei t ti at this bill should pas in
oi ler to induce cimpration lo our most remote bor
der* I confess, sir, 11 th s jspect of the subj°ct I
look upon it as presenting some of the most imposing
questions wh ch can oceupy tie attention of the
American sta1 smati If we a'tempt to con ider it
psa subject of firance onl>, we carry it far below
the standard to wh ch tt ?diances in the great scile
of our interests It is almost, sir, next in magni-
tude to the question of peace or war I look upin
its fai urt, if it is to be followed by the pretention
ot settlements o<i the pub'ic lands, as pregnant with
va«t and unktio >n mischiefs, and is success as
certain'} to be the ultimate means cf proi unng
safety and profecuon to a long line of inland and
undefended frontier, which cannot, in any other
way, be secured against the invasion of the sa-
vage If, however, the love of money must pre
vail, I entreat gentlemen to look through ihe rapid
and protracted march of events, it Will produce, and
wh-n they hav-1 subjected the measure to the test of
practical scrutiny, it will be found to be the moot
profitable scheme for the «ale of the public lands
that has evei jet been devised When they calcu-
lite the ñ Serene between the inteie ' on th
amount of moneys uhich would he r ceived under
the old system, at particular periois, extenhng for
more than fifty 3 ears and th t *mn wh ch would be
realised by prompt and rapid sales under th s law,
I think it must be seen dure would be little leason
in a financial aspect to resist its passage
But as a measure of policy, by which settlements
«pill be invited to your most remote borders, alcg
which you shall form a livm  and massive rampart
of bold and hardy men, its importance can only be
estimated by a review of the actual condition of
our frontier, the relations between us and the hun-
dred Indian tribes who hover like a storm upon our
We tein horizon, and the great in erests of the civi-
lized world, which in the adjustment of its balances
may finally precipitate upon us the mightiest power
of the earth The proposition is startling and im-
posing, but not moie startling than tme
Sir, how is it that we can assume the fact that
the Ind.an tribes are harmless? The his'ory of our
country, passing from its first settlement through the
war of the Revolution, and ihe second war of inde-
penderé?, is replete with contradictary evidence to
any such supposition Peacs' Peace' Security
with the Ind an ' It is but a dream ' He but re-
poses for a seasm in the enjoyment of your favors
until that day shall arrive when he flashes with the
hope of blood and revenge Tne recollection of
the injuries you have inflicted—the lands you have
taken—tne wounded pride jou have humbled, the
very tribute under winch you have placed him,
keeps the fire of hatred unquenched, and fiercely
burning in h s bosom ' He will receive your gifts-,
extend his hand for j our annuities, but instead of
turning his face upon the b eak passes of the Rocky
Mounta-ns, and descending upon the coast of Cali-
fornia, he will patiently await ths period, when
events, guided by the po'ent hand of his old ally,
snail call h m to the war-path and the battle field.
He nill then remember, not your bounties, but
yojr triumph', and he will prepare, in a more for-
midable shape than at any former period, for unit-
ing h s kindred tribes m one solid league against
yoar frontirr bre'h-en. The annuities which you
so bountifully bes'ow upon them exert but a friend-
ly influence, where no other more powerful agency
is brotsght to act upon their councils Their civi
hza it n too, m which some of them, at least, are
rap dly advancing, is bu the instrument of remov-
ing the bdrneis between ycu and them in your
mo e social relations, but cannot at its present
stage have any influence upon a question of war,
which is the na ural clement of th« Indian His
daily pursuits of the wild game of the forest or ihe
prairie, is but ths inspiring mimicry of war, and so
m the midst of peace, Ihe habit (the controlling power
of man af ei all) is kept fresh, inspired and vigo
roHv We have, sir, an illustia'ion of what I say
incneof the most memorable and graphic inci-
dents of I^diin history At the commencement
0! our last «ar with Great Britain, we were pay-
ing to the Indian tribes ample annuities The
Cieek, the mos1 powerful of his kindred, shared
largely of our bounty, but it had ro repress-
in? (if ct upon hi. hVti'e spirit That intre-
pid man, «hom ^oj, Mr President, met in.
that battle lWl which has given immortal
honor lo th- living and the dead, joined them
in the r national councils, and turned their
love of peace to Ihe fierce spirit of war. It was
no the witchery ol h s eloquence, but, sir, the
witchery of their passions' Their love of war'
Their hatred of the border man' He went forth
as the ally snd ihe agent of a great power, and
some kindred spirit of his will bs found to act the
ame pait, with the consolida ed Indian tubes, In
the future d ama of the frontier, wheuever suffi-
ciently active and skilful appliances are brought
home to their prejudces, their habits, and their
passions.
But, Mr President, I consider the question of
danger upon our extended Western frontier, -which
has been treated as utterly illusory, as having its
origin in the present progress ot international
events which no skill can avoid, and no human
arm can stav I refer, ir, to the relations between
ourselves and G ea' Britain I refer to her inte
rests, ihe posit on she occupies in the affairs of
mankind, and the poi«r which sooner or later she
will be called on  0 exert
I do net wish to be misunderstood I concur
rnost fu'ly in Ihe opinions expressed by my friend
from Missouri [Mr- Limj] m the debate of this
morning, upon another subject, in which he advert-
ed lo the action of that Government towards us.
He expressed his opinion that, far the present, she
had no designs of & hostile character, but while th s
