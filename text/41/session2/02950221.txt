The Tariff—Mr, Asper.
Ho. of Eeps.
the part of those favoring free trade to have the tariff
on pipr iron reduced, and a redaction of $2 a ton has
been recommended. From this and other causes it
is apprehended thero will be a reduction in the price
of pis iron, lint this is to be hoped for rather than
feared; 20 per cont., or about one half of our present
calculated profits, would be an ample return."
It seems that there is no necessity for this
increased price upon pig iron, unless we intend
1o put extravagant profits into the pockets of
the manufacturer. The amount consumed in
this country is about 1,800,000 tons a year,
with but a small importation necessary for the
manufacture of hollow-ware, stoves, and wliat
not. It would therefore seem that we pay a
large amount which goes into the pockets of
Some one and not into the Treasury of the Gov-
ern ment, the amount being about §16,000,000.
I am told that this is necessary to encourage
labor. How? Docs it increase the wages of
labor in this country? No ; the rate of wages
in this country is not as much greater now as
the increase in the price of clothing and every
other article of consumption. The increase in
the wages of labor is about, 25 per cent., while
the increased price of iron and other articles
of every-day consumption is from 80 to 100
jjer cent. Upon salt the increase is 100 per
cent., lumber 50 per cent., iron from 80 to 100
per cent. But I am told that it makes a mar-
ket for the farmer. Why, sir, we in the State
of Missouri are compelled to raise wheat at a
price fixed by the dealers in the Liverpool
market; we get for our wheat what the Liver-
pool dealers say wo shall get in the market
there, and that is regulated by the supply of
the world. We are compelled to raise our
wheat in competition with the pauper labor of
Europe. Does that benefit us ? The amount,
of wheat exported during eleven mouths of
1860 was 31,000,000 bushels, and about 1,000,-
000 barrels of flout, making altogether about
$48,000,000 worth of wheat exported to Eu-
rope, the price being fixed there. This follow-
ing table, taken from No. 20 of the pamphlets
issued from the Bureau of Statistics, shows l he
amount ol" wheat imported into England from
other countries

It appears from this that we furnish to ling-
land one fifth of her wheaten food, and that
the importation from the United States is on
the increase. The following statement from
No. 5 of the pamphlet reports from the Bureau
of Statistics shows the increase in 18C9, and
at the same time a comparison with 11 months
of 1868:

Thus it will be seen that our grain is exported,
and the price is regulated abroad.
The proof of this fact is apparent to all; but
a reference to the prices current will present
proof to satisfy the most credulous.
I have here a table of prices taken from the
price-current of the New York Journal of
Commerce, which states that, the price of wheat
is ruling lower, and that the decline of the price
of wheat in Liverpool caused the price to decline
in New York 2 cents per bushel. Here are the
quotations taken from that paper, under date
of March 22, 1870 :
" Breadstuffs.—Iho market for State and Western
flour is dull, and priccs are 5 cents lower. The for-
eign advices are discouraging, and curtail tho export
business, while the local dealers purchase only as

As we have seen, the price of grain goes
down as the amount of exportation increases,
so that exportation does not seem to control.
The controlling influence is abroad. The pres-
sure at home is so great for money that the
farmer must send forward his grain at whatever
sacrifice. The price rulc3 much lower than a
year ago, while the exportation was very much
lower. Tho following quotations and compari-
sons, taken from the Chicago Tribune of a
recent date, show tho change ;

It appears from actual facts that the farmer
of the West raises his wheat iu competition
with tho pauper labor of Europe; that the
prices are fixed for hiin abroad, and at home
tho cost of raising his wheat is enhanced by a
tariff levied, not to encourage the industry of
the country, but to protect certain special in-
terests, which aro controlled by a few men who
make large profits out of the burdens imposed
upon the people.
An adjustment of the tariff on a more just
and equitable basis would save to the farmers
in reduction on salt, lumber, wool and wool-
ens, and iron alone $50,000,000, and would
only reduce tho receipts of the Treasury about
$10,000,000, which is only about half the sum
agreed upon as a general reduction of taxation
through impost duties by the Committee of
Ways and Means. This burden of $50,000,000
could be lifted from the shoulders of the peo-
ple, the farmer, the artisan, the mechanic, and
the professions of the country, without injury
to a single interest now flourishing throughout
the land. It might reduce the inordinate prof-
its of the iron, salt, arid lumber-men; but they
still would have fair profits, and their patriot-
ism should teach them greater moderation.
With such a change I believe prosperity would
again abound everywhere.
How is it, then, that this tariff upon iron
increases the demand for the agricultural pro-
duets of this country? The whole number of
persons engaged directly and indirectly in
manufactures iu this country is but about
2,000,000, not to exceed that. Take all the
capitalists and laborers, skilled and otherwise,
with their wives and children, and they will
not cxceed 2,000,000 persons. Now, suppose
you double your manufactures, increase your
iron-making establishments, your woolen and
cotton and other manufactures, and where will
itbring you? It would only increase the num-
ber of persons interested in those manufactures
some 2,000,000 more. And what increased
demand would Jliat make for the productions
of this country ? Only enough to feed those
2,000,000. And the State of Illinois alone—
certainly the States of Illinois, Iowa, and Mis-
souri—are capable to-day, without bringing
another aero under cultivation than is now cul-
tivated there, of producing a surplus sufficient
to feed such an increase in the manufacturing
population of this country.
Now, if you bring down the price of iron, an
article of general consumption, and the price
of lumber, and of salt, and of woolen goods,
as yon may do by a proper adjustment of your
tariffs, what will be the result? "Sou will in-
crease the price of everything the farmer pro-
duces ; that is, he will get an increased profit
upon his wheat and corn and beef and'pork
which he sends to market; and you would also
reducc tho price of the articles which the laborer
consumes. You would give him higher wages,
and enable him to surround his wife and little
ones with more comforts. By so adjusting your
tariff duties you would increase the demand for
these articles; for iron, because the farmer
if he is making greater profits will buy more
agricultural implements ; you would increase
the demand for lumber, because tlie farmer will
then build better houses; you would increase
the demand for salt, because more beef and
more pork would bo packed ; and as a matter
of course there will be also a greater demand
for woolen and cotton goods, such a demand
as will aid the manufactures of this country.
_You would also increase your commerce.
You would have no further need of commit-
tees to perambulate the country to find the
causes for tho decay of Americau shipping, as
ship-building would spring up, because an
increased commerce would demand it.
The cost of manufacture, because of our
excessive tariff, prevents the sending abroad
our manufactured goods. Our woolen export <
have fallen off to nothing, and every other
interest also suffers. Our direct exports tn
England are double our imports from England.
Here are the figures ;
Wo exported last year direct to England.. &31 ">,315,17'!
Wo imported direct from England  10,",050,920
9108,231,550
making a difference of trade in our favor of
$108,204,550 as to our direct trade. But we
must have silks and fine broadcloths from
France, ivory from Africa, coffee from liio
Janeiro and other countries, tea from China,
hides from South America, and we pay fVu ihese
goods for the most part not in an exchange of
our own wheat, flour, woolen and cotton,
shoes, leather, but iu goods purchased by the
importer in England. This is done because of
our high tariffs, and consists iu the fact tha1, we
cannot manufacture as cheap iu consequence
of the excessive burdens upon labor and pro-
duction. Let us have varied industry ; leteverv
business and interest have a fair chance and
all this will change, trade and commerce re-
vive, and the farmer, the laborer, and the
mechanic will realize larger and better returns
for their labor.
My colleague [Mr. Burdett] on Saturday
appealed to this House in behalf of protection,
and feelingly said: " I have seen the pauper
laborers of Europe. I have seen them of every
description. I have seen them scrambling for
the carcase of a dead animal for food for the
wife, mother, and children. I have seen ail
this, and I protest," said he, " against such a
