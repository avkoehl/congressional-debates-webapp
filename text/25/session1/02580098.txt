It is a common remare that he public w 11 rol

debtors be at last good for the amount wh ch they
owe T " same obsei vation might be made wilh

debtois should be able to pay him, he will eventu-

banking it is «peculating upon mere credit, without
any solid capital to sustain it
According to the testmony given bei<re the
secret committee oí the House ot Commons by the
d rectors of the Bank of England, pre vious to its
reeharter, it appears that the principle upon vvInch
they had proceeded m regulating then is ties, was
to have as much com ">nd bullion in their coTeis as
amounted to a third part of ihe liabilities of the
bank, mcliid ng sums deposited, as well as notes in
circulation This rule of one for three maj, or
may not, be a corree t standard I shall not pre-
tend to determine this point That bank Ins since
been compelled to depart from t bj causes similar
to these wheb have cinshed our own banking
institutions fh - I «ill bay, however, ih ' it one
do'lar in specie, for three of circ htion and depo
sites, be no more than a «afe standard for the E mk
oí England,*íhen our banks ought to have a larger
propoi tion oí the precious metals to render them
secure The circulation of each one of our eight
hundred banks is limited within a narrow sphere
Their paper does not travel far from home When
a panic arises, from any cause whatever, nearly
their whole circulation may be poured in upon them
in the course of a very few dajs, and thus they
  ">} be es i pellen 10 suspend specie payments
Not so the Bar of Englpn 1 its circuí it ion is co-
exlens.ve with the kingdom md ¡Is not>s ->ie evert
wheic a 'egal lender, except ?' its own counter
TV joint s ock a id private banks pay their own
noles with notes of the Bank of England Itiol-
lows, as a nece s->r; con^quence, that it would
require much nine to make an extensive run upon
this institution, and an\ pane wheh mighl arise,
would have ample opportunity to subside before
their specie conlel Le exhausted^
When the d p site bilí wis before 'he Señale at
us last s s on, ineSeialot fiom South Carolina
otfrted an am'nd.nent ,nohibitmg the Secretar, of
the Treasury from emplo} ng any bank as a depo-
sitory of (he pubhe money, unless it had one dollar
m specie ior five oí us cnculation and deposites,
public as-well as private This propos tion, at that
time, received ni} hearty support The wlole
subject was afterwards le! ned to a select commit-
tee, of w inch I had ihe honor of be ng a membei
and thev reported a provision m substance reqnn-
ing each depository 11 have one e'ohar in specie for
five of its cuculation and prívale depcsi'es \ou
U li e bsetve, sir, that the public elepositts were en-
ttrelj exclude 1 irom this provision Ti ev wee
not taken into the estimate No pi por ion of spe-
cie Mas lequired to sec ire them One would sup-
pose that, m all conscience, this provision was sut-
ticicntly liberal t vvaids i' e bulks When the bill
afteiwards came lo be di cussed before 11" Senat<>,
it was found that ev ?n this hm tati n v/o l'd deprive
many of these banl s of tnc public lop sites, and
according to my recollect on, in which I th nk I
cannot be mistaken, if we had mide it oi« foi ten,
several of them would have been excluded Tor
tins re von the Senate determined, against my fee-
ble effor's, not to lequire the banks to hold avy
fued proportion of specie compared with th«r cu-
culation uud depcsites Lverv, prov sion on the
subject w ps stricken out of the bill, ana the amount
oí specie which the banks v tre to hold was lcfi en-
tirely to the discretion ot the Secietfij of the Trea-
sury On that occasion 1 turned prophet mjself,
as «eveial of my friends on this floor can testify I
anticipa ed an exp'osion of seveial of the  deposite
banks, but it came sooner than I had expected
Under these impiessirns, you may judge of my
astonishment when I s iw it stated bv the Secretary
of the T easuij in his late report, speaking of the
e'eposite banks in the aggiegate, lhat " their imme-
diate means, compareel with the r immediate lia-
bilities, w ere soniew hat strongei in November than
Ma\, but wtre at both per ods nearly one to two
and a half, or greater than the usual ratio, in the
best times, of most ban's which have a large
amount of deposites in possession " To sustain
this asseitior, he refers to table Gt in the appendix
ot his repoit Upon examining this table the diffi-
culty at enee vanished I found that the Secre-
tar), instead of deducing the amount due by
these banks to other banks, from an aggre-
gate composed of the amount clue irom other
banks to them, and the notes of these other
banks m their possession, and setting down the
balance as an dem of the immediate means of the
depc site ban , had placed tne sums due lo other
ban sew cne side of his statement, and the notes
of other banks, and the sums due fiom them, on
the other The inaccuracy of this course oe pio-
ceeding will appear clearly from a brief example
"which I shall present Suppose a bank to possess
§100,000 m spec e, and ns cuculation and depo-
sites to amount to §400,000 It would then stand
I as 1 to 4 But suppose it ow ed a balance to oihei
i banks of $200,000, and other banks owed ltpie-
cisely the same amount, bv adding these sums of
jp200,000 to Use i no and to ineoth" side of Ihesta e
ment, vou would change the apparent co idilioii of
the ban! , and male its immediate means the one-
half, instead of the one-fouith, of lis immedinte
responsibilities The slaten ent would then stand
thus, immediate means §300,000, and immediate
responsibilities |600 000, or a proportion of
$1 foi §9 In tin veiy mannei, as all can
peiceive who will examine the Secretary's state-
ment, has he brought the average condition of the
deposite banks uplo the standard of one for almost
two and a half
These accounts between the banks are often
adjustc' Balances are suffered lo lemain with
ea~h oilier, because Ihey can at all limes be rea-
dily commanded for immediate use If one bank
lias money in the vaults of another in us im-
mediate vjcmitv, it is the same tuing as if it were
m its own vaults Upon the least pressure it
w ould be uithdrawn rhere'bie, the balance due
lo one bank from another upon settlement, and not
the full a nount, can only be estimated among its
immediate means
According to this melho 1 of calculation, which is
clearly the onlj just mode which can be adopted,
the deposite banls, m the aggregate, have not quite
one doll u of immediate means to meet $4 40 of
their immediate ie«ponsibiliiii.s, and tha' they have
even this pioporhon,proceeds upon tne supposition
that they con command the balances due to them
from other banks m specie If they can not, the
specie m their possession wo lid not equal enr 
dollar fe i seven dollars and fifty cents of their c l-
calation and deputies
Now tins is the aveiage condition of all the
banks Manv individual banks among them are
in a better condition, whilst many others are m a
much worse
The Seeretaiy of the Tieasurv m the same ta-
ble, (Q, ) has picoentcd the ' condit on of deposite
banks on o-about June 15, 183?, m different sec-
tions of t ic cojntry " In this table ne classifies
these banks under six el Pa ent heads, according tj
the  diTerent portions of ihe Umon within which
th°y a e sit tated One of these classes is Alabama,
Mississippi, Liuisiana, and iennessee, and it
appears that th deposite banks m these States
have net one dili i of immediate means for
twenty dollars of then immediate responsibilities '
The vvholtf amount of specie in their vaults i<
$1,168,024, whilst the balance due by then to other
banks is §2 516 773 All the specie which they
possess would thus le less by £,1348 751 than
sufficient to paj this balance Independently of it,
there would then be left $21,480 819 of circulation
and public and private deposites, without one
dollar of specie to meet it, and m these banks a
large pioportion of the pjbhc revenue is now
deposited
The deposite bat ks in Ne v Jersey, Pennsylva-
nia, Delaware, Mainland, and the Distnetof Co-
lumbia, are classified together Their specie and
the balance due to them fr m other banks,
amounted on tie ]5fh Ture Jast lo the sum of
§1,732,478, whilst then circulation and public and
private deposites were <J9,357,947 Thus it ap-
pear> that these b inks bail not one dollar of im-
mediate trails for $5 40 of their immediate re-
sponsibility If the balance due to them from
other banks,, which amounted to $9-í7,921, is not
to be corsidwed as immediate means, tnen their
specie, to wit, §744,557, is not equal to one dollai
for §12 50 of their immeliate responsibilities
1 he depos te banks of Virginia, North Carolina,
South Caiohna, and Georgia, which are classed
together, had m specie, and the balance due to
them from oihei banks, §2,245,423, whilst their
cuculation, and public and private deposites,
amounted to §13,423,627 Thus tnese banks had
not cne dollar of immediate means for §5 95 of
their immediate responsibihes If the balanee due
to them upon a settlement w ilh other banks,
amounting to §176,469, be excluded from the esti-
mate, then tneir specie, to wit, §2,068,954, is not
equal to one do''ai for §6 45 of their immediate
responsibilities
The deposite banks m each of the other three
classes, composed of he New England &fates, New
York, and the western States including Michigan,
«"ic no iti so bid a cend tion Their immediate
respcnsibiln es were so muco greatei than one dol-
lar toi lour dollars and forty cents of their imme-
diate responsibilities, as to bring the general
average of all the deposite banks throughout the
Union neatly down to that standard
I have not examined each of these banks in de-
tail No doubt manv of them are m a sound con-
ditie n My object is to show that the sjstem, as a
whole, cannot be lelied upon by the General Go-
vernment I am one of the last men m the Se-
nate who would attack the credit ot individual
banks I therefore purposely avoid going into
particulars I shall proceed no furiher than the
course of m> Tgument renders indispensable, and
therefore justifies
The suspension of specie pa3tnents Üvoughout
the coun rj, has, in ove íespect, been a most for-
túnale occunence for the deposite bsnk« along tne
Atlantic seaboard It has enabled thin to pay
nearly the who'e amount of the pub ic deposites in
their possession m their own e'epnciated paper
The public cred tors were compelled to accept drafts
upon them, because ihe Secietarj of the Treasury
h id nothing bettrtogive and thus tieir debt to
the Government h ¡sbee i nearly extn gmshed The
balance sull lemanung due to us is chiefly depo-
sited in banks b~} oí d the mountain
The Senator Aom Kentucky (Hi Glat) has
used some strong e\pHssmis in ¡egard io the
oovver which the bih authonzi'i" the Seceiary of
the Treasurj lo settp  w.ih the depo-ite ban'is has
conferred upon that officei He said it was greater
than ever ought to be confided to any man under a
free Government, and would optiate severely upon
ihe banks And what is this power1 These insti-
tutions had agreed to receive our funds on deposite,
and to credit them as cash to oui account They
are liable, bv the teim of th ir own coitracfsi,
to be drawn upon, at any moment, foi the
whole amount m their possession We know
that they aie unable to pay, and theieforeinterpose
for the r relief We an hori7f lhj Secretary to
giv" them ti ne, and to accept the balance due
trim them in three nsfa'meot , pajable at the end
of four, s x and n ne months charging them no
more than two per cent interest If Ihey fail to
comp'y wi h th s( leisomble tein s, then we direct
sun to be broug it An 1 j et this has been de-
nounced as confiding a dangerous discretion to the
Secretary, and as a great haidchip upon ihe banks
