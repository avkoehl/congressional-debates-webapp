Brigadier General POWELL CLAYTON,

Pine Bluff:

All the steamers except one got out of the Arkansas; that one, the Saint Cloud, I understand, is at Pine Bluff. The Eclipse was fired into by about forty rebel cavalry; the guard returned about sixty shouts and the rebels skedaddle. None of our people hurt. Colonel Erskine was put on shore above the Cut- Off, about twenty miles from the Mississippi. This information just received from Doctor Miller, who was with the fleet.
