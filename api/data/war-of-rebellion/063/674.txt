Colonel P. CLAYTON,Pine Bluff:

Notify the commander ofa the Eighteenth Illinois Infantry that there are said to be quite a number of guerrillas on his route. Direct him to clean them out as well as he can, consistent with the safety of the train; also to baring in all the serviceable horses and good beef-cattle he can find; also to send report to me as soon as he gets near enough to make it safe for a messenger.

Brigadier-General SALOMON,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: A considerable part of General West's command is being withdrawn, leaving on his line only enough for pickets. Colonel McLean is ordered to re-enforce that line, if necessary, boat i case of an attack a part of your force may also be required there. Especial vigilance will be necessary for a few days. It will be well to send a scout to Benton and the crossing of the Saline beyond that place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
