a No report made.

Of the part taken by Battery H, Fifth Artillery, on the 20th and 21st, I have to state that Lieutenant Fessenden fitted up two Napoleon guns on the morning of the 20 th and took position near the Third Brigade, remaining until near noon, when he was ordered to Chattanooga; again on Monday, the 21st, he went back to near Rossville and remained until nightfall with two guns; when he was ordered by Major Mendenhall to proceed with Battery M, Fourth Artillery, to the rear, which he did, and on Tuesday morning his four Napoleon guns were placed in position, while his two Parrott guns were placed in the fort near the river, where they yet remain.

GEO. A. KENSEL,

Captain Fifth Artillery, Chief of Artillery, First Division.
