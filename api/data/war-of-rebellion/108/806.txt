JACKSON'S RIVER, December 21, 1863.

Major-General EARLY,

Harrisonburg, Va.:

Fitz. Lee is after Averell, crossing to-day about 10 o'clock a. m. severav miles above here. Averell is evidently gone toward White Sulphur Springs, and will take, no doubt, Anthony's Creek route; if he does not, he will go down the Kanawha Valley. I heard nothing from Echols. If Fitz. Lee's horses will stand it, he will overtake Averell. Owing to the delay I am still gathering prisoners. If you to not telegraph otherwise I will move my infantry to Warm Springs to-morrow. Ruffner has returned from his scouts and confirms the above.

WM. L. JACKSON,

Colonel.
