BALTIMORE, July 13, 1864-11 a. m.

GENERAL: I was in rebel lines at Monocacy and Federick during Saturday and Sunday last. The entire corps of Ewell and Breckinridge were there, estimated to be 25,000 or 30,000 strong. They had besides a large cavalry force, say 5,000 or 6,000. They were well supplied with artillery and stores. The main body left Monocacy Sunday morning, and a strong rear guard left at 12 m. or 1 p. m. They marched down the Georgetown pike. I last heard of them at Hyattstown, on that pike. It was said that they were making for Edward's and Noland's Ferries. A Union cavalry force from Hunter's command entered Frederick as the rebels left it. The rebel rear guard left precipitately, being under the impression that Hunter's main force was approaching. When I left Federick, at 12 m. yesterday, Hunter was said to be at Martinsburg with a part of his force. The railroad is intact this side of Monocacy. I came down the pike, which is now unobstructed.

OFFICE MEDICAL INSPECTOR, U. S. ARMY,

41 North Charles Street, Baltimore, July 14, 1864.

COLONEL: In obedience to the order of Major-General Wallace, dated yesterday, I have the honor to submit the following statement:

The Federal dead left on and near the field at Monocacy on the 9th instant, were buried under my supervision on the 10th and 11th instant. There were buried on the field, 117; and in the neighborhood, 4; making a total of 121.

Our wounded left on the field were carefully gathered up on the 10th and 11th instant, placed in the general hospital at Federick, and comfortably provided for. The number in hospital on the 12th, when I left that city and when, I believe, every man had been taken from the field, was 189. To these should be added 15 cases which I found at New Market, several miles this side of Frederick, making a total of 204.
