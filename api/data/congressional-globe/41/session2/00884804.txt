Mr. MORTON. If there is no Senator who
desires to listen to the minutes, and as time is
valuable, I suggest that the reading of the

house bills.
The bill (H. R. No. 2104) providing for
refunding the interest paid by the State of
Massachusetts on money expended by her on
account of the war of 1812-15 was read twice
by its title.
Mr. SUMNER. As that matter has already
been considered by the Committee on Foreign
Relations, I ask that the bill take its place on
the Calendar.
Mr. HAMLIN. And I move that it be
printed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill has
already been ordered to be printed. It will
be placed on ths Calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the
Senate the bill (H. R. No. 253) authorizing
the allowance of the claim of the State of Min-
nesota to lands for the support of a State uni-
versity.
Mr. RAMSEY. I see the chairman of the
Committee on Public Lands is here ; and I
suggest to him that we had better pass that bill
now. The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wil-
liams] has the matter particularly in charge.
Mr. POMEROY. I should like to have it
lie on the table for a few moments until the
Senator from Oregon comes in who has the
matter in charge.

withdraw it for the present.
COMMODORi! S. B. BISSELL.
The Senate proceeded to consider the amend-
ments of the House of Representatives to the
joint resolution (S. R. No. 107) for the relief
of Commodore S. B. Bissell.
The amendments of the House of Repre-
sentatives were in line four, after the name
"S. B. Bissell," to insert the words "and
Commander John C. Carter;" in line five to
strike out the word "he" and insert "they,-"
and also to amend the title of the joint resolu-
tion by adding thereto "and Commodore John
C. Carter."
Mr. ANTHONY. I am in favor of those
amendments; but I think that there is another
one that ought to be made, covering the same
principle. I have seen the law odicer of the
Navy Department, who has promised to send
me down a note to day on (he subject. If it
is a similar case it ought to go in this resolu-
tion; if not, we can pass the resolution as
amended by the House.
The VIpE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
withdraw it for the present.
