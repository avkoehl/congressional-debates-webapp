Mr. SHERMAN. Now I demand that the
bill be read at length. I called over and over
again to know what it was.
ThePRESIDENTpro tempore. The Chair
must be excused for cot hearing what Sen-
ators say in this confusion.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I hope the Chair will
see that the confusion ends by asking Senators
to take their seats.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The best
way for the Senator from Ohio will be to move
to reconsider.
Mr. SHERMAN. I enter that motion until
I know what the bill is.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill
will be read at length.
The Chief Clerk read the bill.
Mr. RAMSEY. Now, Mr. President, this
is simply one of those efforts to prevent the
passage of the bill from the House of Repre-
sentatives abolishing the franking privilege.
[Laughter.]
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the
Senator'from Ohio persist in the motion to
reconsider?
Mr. SHERMAN. No, sir.

german language at west point.
Mr. BLAIR. I was recognized by the
Chair and made a motion to discharge the
Committee on Military Affairs from House
joint resolution No. 104, to add a professorship
of German at the Military Academy.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Missouri moves to discharge the
Committee on Military Affairs from the fur-
ther consideration of a House joint resolu-
tion.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What is the object of
that? â€¢
Mr. BLAIR. The object of it is to teach
German at the Military Academy.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Discharging the com-
mittee will not teach German.
Mr. RAMSEY. I hope the Senator will not
interfere with the bill from the House abolish-
ing the franking privilege.
Mr. BLAIR. I hope the Senator from
Minnesota will not interfere with my joint
resolution.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the motion of the Senator from
Missouri, to discharge the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs from the further consideration of
the joint resolution (H. R. No. 104) directing
the Secretary of War to add the German lan-
guage in the United States Military Academy
at West Point.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I hope that will not be
done.
My. SPENCER. Let us hear the joint
resolution read, so that we may urtderstaud
what it is.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The joint
resolution will be read.
The Chief Clerk read the joint resolution,
as follows:
"Whereas the English and German languages are
more generally spoken in the United States than
any other tongues; and whereas during our late
civil war, embarrassment frequently occurred in
consequence of companies and regiments of Ger-
mans being commanded by officers who did not
understand their language: Therefore.
Jiesolved, &c.t That the Secretary of War is liereby
directed to add the German language, in the regu-
lar course of studies, in the United fcitates Military
Academy; and that he cause to be employed one
German professor, and two German assistant pro-
fessors, for that purpose.
Mr. CARPENTER. I object.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the
Senate discharge the Committee on Military
Affairs from the further consideration of this
bill?
Mr. SPENCER. I hope not.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I have no doubt that
the law, as the West Point Academy is now
organized, authorizes the proper authorities
to take any steps necessary for the teaching
of any foreign language, be it German, or
French, or Danish, or Spanish, or what-
ever 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator will suspend his remarks. The hour of
nine o'clock has arrived, and, pursuant to the
concurrent resolution of the two Houses of
Congress, I pronounce the Senate adjourned
