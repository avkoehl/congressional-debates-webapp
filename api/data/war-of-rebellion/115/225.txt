HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, February 16, 1862. (Received 19th.)

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: In reply to your communication of the 13th instant in relation to "persons received and held in confinement at fortress Monroe other than prisoners of war since the 4th of March, 1861," I have the honor to report that there are no records at these headquarters whereby such information can be obtained previous to my assuming command on the 17th of August, 1861.

On the 14th of September, 1861, I received from Major-General Dix by direction of the Secretary of War the following-named prisoners arrested in Baltimore: S. T. Wallis, George W. Brown, Henry M. Warfield, William G. Harrison, Charles H. Pitts, Leonard G. Quinlan, T. Parkin Scott, Robert M. Denison, Lawrence Sangston, Henry May, Ross Winans, F. Key Howard, John Hanson Thomas, Andrew A. Lynch and Thomas W. Hall, Jr. *

On the 23rd of September, 1861, Mr. Ross Winans was released by the direction of the Secretary of War on his renewing the parole which he had given on a previous arrest. On the 24th of September the remainder of these prisoners were forwarded by direction of Lieutenant-General Scott to Fort Lafayette.
