HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 9, 1863.

Colonel IRWIN;

I send by Captain [Thomas S.] Dennett, assistant quartermaster, copies of telegraphic dispatches sent you this morning.

From these and from the testimony of Lieutenant Francis, who escaped from Franklin, I am quite sure the enemy intend to avail themselves of the present state of things to attack Brashear City. You will know my helpless condition here in regard to troops, and the limited aid I can give.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BRASHEAR CITY,

June 9, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. SMITH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I must have by the afternoon train to-day three or four light pieces of some kind. An attack was intended last night, I am sure, and the Confederate officers say they will surely have this place by Saturday. I have a mob, officered by fools, but I have put them into some shape, and, with three or four light pieces, I can show fight well. They are going to attack from the southern side of the city, and it is wholly unprotected. The battery will not help us; they will keep clear of that. There is nothing whatever to hinder their shelling the city, and they have artil-
