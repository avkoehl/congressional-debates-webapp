PADUCAH, February 15, 1862.

General HALLECK:

Arrived at Paducah. * * * I think General Tilghman and prisoners had better be sent to Cairo and there offered terms. If officers elect to go on parole to Cincinnati they could go by rail.

Brigadier-General.

NEW YORK, February 16, 1862.

Honorable Mr. STANTON:

What has the Government done toward the release of Colonel Corcoran? A meeting at Tammany Hall on Wedensday, which we have kept back. I await answer at telegraph office.

Judge C. P. DALY, New York:

The Government has taken the measures they deem proper to effect the release of Colonel Corcoran and all other prisoners held in rebel Staes, and will disclose what they have done when proper to be disclosed. It is hoped that the rash indiscretion of persons pretending to be Colonel Corcoran's friends may not induce the rebels to prolong his imprisonment or refuse his exchange.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SIR: General Stone I rank among my friends. I believe in his intergrity and fidelity. So fully do I believe that scarcely anything could shake the belief. He has served me as a friend and I want to let him know how truly I sympathize with him. I inclose an open letter* for him which I desire you to read, and unless there is something objectionable in it which I cannot see do me the favor tohave it forwarded to him. If I should go to New York next week as I expect can I have a pass to visit him?

Very faithfully and truly,

JOS. H. BRADLEY.
