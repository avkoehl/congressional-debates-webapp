shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Pub-
lic Printing, at the commencement of each
session of Congress, to submit to the Joint
Committee on Printing estimates of the quan-
tity of paper of all descriptions which will, in
his opinion, be required for the execution of
the public printing during the coming year.
The Joint Committee on Printing shall then
fix upon a standard of paper for the different
descriptions of congressional and executive
printing, and it shall be the duty of the Super-
intendent of Public Printing, under the direc-
tion of the Joint Committee on Printing, to
advertise in only two newspapers published in
each of the cities of New York, Cincinnati,
Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Wash-
ington, for sealed proposals to furnish the
Government of the United States with paper,
of the quality and in the quantity specified in
the advertisements, and it shall be the duty of
the Superintendent to furnish samples of the
standard papers adopted by the committee to
applicants therefor; the said sealed proposals
to be opened before and the award of contracts
to be made by the Joint Committee on Print-
ing to the lowest and best bidder for the inter-
est of the Governments Provided, That the
advertisement for sealed proposals for furnish-
ing paper shall designate the minimum portion
of each particular quality of paper required for
either three months, six months, or one year,
as the Joint Committee on Printing may de-
termine; but when the minimum portion so
specified shall exceed in any case one thousand
reams, the advertisement shall state that pro-
posals will be received for one thousand reams
or more: And provided further, That no pro-
posals shall be considered by the Joint Com-
mittee on Printing, unless accompanied by
satisfactory evidence that the person or per-
sons making said proposals are manufacturers
of or dealers in the description of paper which
they propose to furnish: And provided further,

of time for filling the same shall he designated

paper.
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That it
shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Pub-
lic Printing to compare every lot of paper de-
livered by any contractor with the standard of
quality, and also to see that it is of the weight
contracted for, and to refuse to accept any
paper from any contractor which does not con-
form to the standard of quality and is not of
the stipulated weight. And in case of differ-
ence of opinion between the Superintendent
of Public Printing and any contractor for paper
with respect to its quality, the matter of differ-
ence shall be determined by the Joint Com-
mittee on Printing: Provided, That in default
of any contractor to comply with his contract
in furnishing the paper contracted for, in the
proper time, and of proper quality and weight,
it shall be the duty of the Superintendent of
Public Printing to report the same to the Joint
Committee on Printing if Congress is in ses-
sion, or to the Secretary of the Interior if dur-
ing a recess of Congress, and he shall, under
the direction of the Joint Committee on Print-
ing or of the Secretary of the Interior, as the
case may be, enter into a new contract with
the lowest and best bidder for the interest of
the Government, amongst those whose propos-
als were rejected at the last opening of bids,
or advertise for new proposals, under the reg-
ulations before established; and during the
interval which may thus be created, he shall,
under the direction of the Joint Committee on
Printing or of the Secretary of the Interior, as
above provided, purchase in open market, at
the lowest market price, all such paper neces-
sary for the public service. For any increase
of cost to the. Government in procuring a sup-
ply of paper for the use of the Government,
the contractor or contractors in default and his
or their securities shall be charged with and
held responsible for the same, and shall be
prosecuted upon their bond by the Solicitor of
the Treasury, in the name of the United States,
in the circuit court of the United Slates in the
district in which the defaulting contractor re-
sides; and to enable the Solicitor to do so, it
shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Pub-
lic Printing to report to him the default on its
happening, with a full statement of all the facts
in the case: And provided further, That the
Joint Committee on Public Printing, or, during
the recess of Congress, the Secretary of the
Interior, be authorized to empower the Super-
intendent of Public Printing to make purchases
of paper, in open market, at the lowest market
price, whenever in their opinion the quantity
required is so small, or the want is so imme-
diate, as not to justify advertisement for and
award of contract therefor.
Sec. 6. And be it further enacted, That all
laws and parts of laws, joint resolutions, or
parts of resolutions, conflicting with the above
provisions, be and they are hereby repealed ;
nor shall the Superintendent of Public Print-
ing print any greater number of the reports
herein named, unless otherwise directed by
either House of Congress.

moval of Causes in certain Cases from State
Courts.
Be it enacted by th e Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That if in any suit already
commenced, or that may hereafter be com-
menced, in any State court against an alien, or
by a citizen of the State in which the suit is
brought against a citizen of another State, and
the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of five
hundred dollars, exclusive of costs, to be made
to appear to the satisfaction of the court, a citi-
zen of the State in which the suit is brought is
or shall be a defendant, and if the suit so far
as relates to the alien defendant or to the de-
fendant who is the citizen of a State other than
that in which the suit is brought, is or has been
instituted or prosecuted for the purpose of re
straining or enjoining him, or if the suit js one
in which there can be a final determination of
the controversy, so far as it concerns him, with-
out the presence of the other defendants as
parties in the cause, then and in every such
case the alien defendant, or the defendant who
is a citizen of a State other than that in which
the suit is brought, may, at any time before the
trial or final hearing of the cause, file a petition
for the removal of the cause as against him into
the next circuit court of the United States to
be held in the district where the suit is pending,
and offer good and and sufficient surety for his
entering in such court, on the first day of its
session, copies of said process against him, and
of all pleadings, depositions, testimony, and
other proceedings in said cause affecting or
concerning him, and also for his there appear-
ing and entering special bail in the cause, if
special bail was originally requisite therein;
and it shall be thereupon the duty of the State
court to accept the surety and proceed no further
in the cause as against the defendant so apply-
ing for its removal; and any bail that may have
been originally taken shall be discharged, and
the said copies being entered as aforesaid in
such court of the United States, the cause shall
there proceed in the same manner as if it had
been brought there by original process against
the defendant who shall have so filed a petition
for its removal as above provided. And any
attachment of the goods or estate of the de-
fendant by the original process shall hold the
goods or estate so attached to answer the final
judgment, in the same manner as by the laws
of such State they would have been holden to
answer final judgment had it been rendered by
the court in which the suit commenced; and
any injunction granted before the removal of
the cause against the defendant applying for its
removal shall continue in force until modified
or dissolved by the United States court into
which the cause shall be removed; and any
bond of indemnity or other obligation given by
the plaintiff upon the issuing or granting of any
attachment, writ of injuetion, or other restrain-
ing process against the defendant petitioning
for the removal of the cause, shall also continue
in full force and may be prosecuted by the de-
fendant and made available for his indemnity
in case the attachment, injunction, or other
restraining process be set aside or dissolved, or
judgment be rendered in his favor, in the same
manner and with the same force and effect as
if such injunction, attachment, or restraining
process had been granted, and such bond had
been originally filed or given in the court to
which the cause is removed. And such re-
moval of the cause, as against the defendant
petitioning therefor, into the United States
court, shall not be deemed to prejudice or take
away the right of the plaintiff to proceed at the
same time with the suit in the State court as
against the other defendants, if he shall desire
to do so. And the copies of all pleadings filed
or entered as aforesaid in the United States
con rt by the defendant applying for the removal
of the cause, shall have the same force and
effect in every respect and for every purpose aa
the original pleadings would have had by the
laws and practicc of the courts of such State
if the cause had remained in the State court.
