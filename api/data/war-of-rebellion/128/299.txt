all the troops I could in such of our eastern counties. To this be consented, and under my authorities some four or five companies have been raised and the volunteering is still going on. The enrolling officers have, however, applied to me for instructions, thinking it their duty under orders to conscript all they find of the proper age and to prevent any more from volunteering. Having only a verbal understanding with His Excellency, I thought it best to lay the matter before you and have the written consent of the Department, so as to avoid any appearance of conflict and relieve the enrolling officers. The policy is so obvious that I need not dwell upon it. A large proportion can and have been obtained where it would be impossible to enforce the law. When it can be vigorously executed, of course, it is best that it should be done. Allow me to hope that it may not be inconvenient for you to give me an early reply.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. B. VANCE.
