CAMP OF 148TH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,

Near City Point, Va., September 26, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

I have the honor to report that on the morning of the 23rd instant, while on duty at the outpost of infantry picket, I met a captain belonging to the First district of columbia Cavalry. I asked him how far out were the cavalry pickets. He replied about one mile and a half. I remarked that I had understood they were out farther than that. He replied that they had been out about six miles, at Sycamore Church, but that finding the enemy in too great force they had deemed it prudent to fall back and had done so. This I reported to Captain Deacon. Do not know the name of the captain who gave me the information.

Shortly after receiving the aforesaid information from Captain Hicks, One hundred and forty-eight New York Volunteers, Colonel Ripley being absent at the time, I deemed the information sufficient important to acquaint General of the facts in connection with it and who happened to be on the spot at the time.

Captain M. H. ASCH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: Everything has been particularly quiet only my line during the night. I sent out a reconnoitering party to ascertain the correctness of the report "of pickets being driven in on my left," and find not the least foundation for such.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. SPEAR,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade, Kautz's Division.
