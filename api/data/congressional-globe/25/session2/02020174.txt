The J eas and nays were thereupon ordered
Mr. MERCER said that no gentleman had a
greater aversion to making this body the arena for
the mtioduction of paragraphs from newspapers
in order that gentlemen might vindicate themselves
from the charges made in thorn, than himself, still
he considered this matter of such a charactei as to
require the notice of this House The individual
who made this charge was a Known and responsi-
ble individual, and if the charge turned out to be
untrue, he could be made answerable before the
tribunals of the countty in heavy damage!  It
had been made after due consideration, and at-
taches itself to evtry member ot the House, then
are we to sit here under a direct imputation, a di-
rect charge, sf this kind hanging over us? He
trusted no opposition w ould be made to the inqu -
ry He regretted exceeding!) that matters of this
kind should be brought before the body, but in
this instance he thought the House ought to liisti
tute the inquiry into the matter a*ked for

and the whole case made out No  he (Mi \V )
would pledge himself, although he was not able
just now to lay bis hands upon the evidence, I 
show instances of investigations being gone into on
newspaper charges more vague and general, and
less specific, thin this, and he trusted that no man
v ho was jealous of his own honor, of the honor of
the House, and purity of the Government, would
stop to inquire about the specifications, when he
was thus impeached This House ought not to
hesitate to go into this, ¡nqtuiv, and he would now
say to the gentleman from Mame, that gentlemen
of his party ought to be the last to hesitate about
this inquiry The name of the person implicated
is not given there, but he wished to be permitted to
say to the gentleman from Maine, that thit gentk-
min was much more likely to be meant than linn,
(Mr W) because, svid Mr W I have no influ-
ence with the Fvecutivo Depirtments to sell-
none whatever I can go home to my constituents
free from an) such suspicion, for just ascertain as I
apply for any thing foi one of mj constituents, he is
sure not to get it, and if 1 tell the department that
one of them is a rogue, that one is suie to be ap-
pointed to oihoe Who is it thil has influence o

which the gentleman fiom Maine acts He hoped
the charge might prove to be untrue, but he hoped
there was not one other gentleman of that panv
who, in all probability, was implicated, that woul I
hesitate about making this inquiry Whit is ihc
object of this inquiry' It is to make lint cciti n

considered this charpe sufficiently specific, and he
would tell tho e g ullemen who alone could be mi
plicated by it, that they had better piuse bef re
they voted against this inquiry They could
go on, and, if the) chose, vo'e nay <n this
occas on, but he wou'd te I them that ticy

Editor of the Courier and Fnqu rer This letter
writer referred to documentary evidence to prov-
ide fact which he asserts, so that the name of the

or whatever it may be, and he shouldjlike to see that

an instrument as this.
Mr BOULDIN said he was under considerable
suspense as to what he should do when he fiist
heard his colleague announce this subject, and he
was struck with t1 e great mdefimteness of the
charge His collei<nie, however, had since ren-
dered it a little moie specific, and now charged
that it was some one among the friends of the Ad-
ministration
Mr WISE explained that the presumption was
that it was some who had influence to sell.
Mr. BOULDIN said whoever was alluded to
was unknown to him, peihaps much more so than
to the gentleman himself, for it was impossible for
Mr B to know any thing about it But when the
character and honor of the members of this House
weie thus implicated, m the first instance all being
involved, and then again one side taken out, and
all on that side indiscriminately involved, while the
other was entirely excluded, and he himself a
member of the side included, he cou'd not itmain
altogether silent Mr B knew whu was the
effect ol such matters, and he had witnessirf, on a
previous occasion, the impru lence of ¿tutlemen
saying any thing when these round (limits ueie
mide In the instance alluded to, the whole House
was generally charged with having been drunk on
a certain occasion, and a mm undertaking to<¿ay
something for the House was condemned, so far as
Mr B knew, throughout the United Slates, as a
drunkard, though Mr B nevct saw him lake a
glass in his life So would it be again if, when
any of their brethren got up and made a chaige
against the whole House, oi against hall of il, the
member who would get up to repel it would him-
self tun the nsk of being held guilty of it
Mr B said he mver felt so much it a loss m
his life to knowvhat sort ol a vote to ¿lie, though
he was at no loss, to Know iht < ifcct ihc lesolnuon

God of Nature has endowed me with
Mr WHITTLESEY of Oh.o was understood
to express his regret that this re^olut on had been
introduced, cut inasmuch as the charge implicated
every member of the House, and affected th© honor
and character of the House itssif, its reputation de-
manded that this investigation should take place.
Tne plan proposed was, m hi  opinion, the most
suitable one, and the history of this country was
replete with precedents, a number of which were
cited by Mr. W*.
Mr POPE considered that the House of Repre-
sentatives was bound to institute this investigation,
and referred to various precedents to show that in-
quiries had bean muituted into charges of a similar
character
Mr GLASCOCK said, that al'hough this charge
was not as definite as he could wish it, still he
thought the resolution ought to be adopted. He
should, however, Jilee to have it modified, so as to
state whethei it was a member of this House which
was charged, because he thought it improper in
this House to ímtitute an inquiry in relation to
rliaiges against members of the other House. If,
however, ihe charge was against a member of this
House, he thought it due to the character of the
House, and to the character of the individual, who-
ever he might be, that the investigation should be
hid lie was unwilling that tins imputation
should rest against an) member of this House, be-
cause he did believe that it would turn out to be
unfounded, or, if the language used should turn
out to be Iruif, that it would be so satisfactorily ex-
plained that the individual will be exonerated from
ill criminal intention, oi intention of doing a cor-
rupt act
He hoped, however, that the gentleman from Vir-
ginia would ma.^e the modification he had sug-
gested, so as to make the resolution point to the
lac!, whether it is a member of this House, whie'i
may be implicated
Mr WISE slid this was made as though he ivas
making the charge The charge was made by
another and a responsible, and all he asked was
that the House might mqune into the facts, and
sreil the charge was true If it was found to b"
i Senator, instead ol a Representative, the commit-
tee cr uld repoit that fact to the House, and it can
do no hirm
Mr DAWSON would suggest to the gentleman
to make his resolution a joint resolution
Mr GLASCOCK presumed it was known by
s une one heie whether this charge was against a
Senator, or member of this House, and whom it was
mide against It had been said, to be sure, that
the letter alluded lo was anonymous , but it must
be recr llectecl lhat the " Spy in Washington" is
well known heie, and he presumed that person
would not hesitate a moment to give the name of
the individual relerred to, or at least to go so fir
dk to say whether he was a member of this or the
other branch of Congress, and if this individual,
(the Spy) who was now with n the hearing of his
voice, would comedown from his present position,
ind si) whether it ir a member of this House, he
believed this resolution «ould be agreed to by an
overwhelming rrnjor ty
Mr WISE Suppose il is a member of the
Senate
Mi GL1SC0CK Then I would move to lay
the '«.solution on the table
Mr WISE Have we not as much light lo
investigate corruption in a member of the Senate,
wuh a view cf impeachment, as of a member of
this House?
Mr GLA'COrK This mislit be all right
em u ,'h, bul > <> thought the most proper course for
us to pursue in lei ilion io this matter, was first to
a certain wh llicr it wis a a nst a member of thu
House, ind Ir ( n we could mr re properly mstituie
I'u injury If it vas .-gainst a merrbei of the
other branch of Congress, he had no doubt but
th it body would institute the proper inquiry He
thought tii mattci ought to be more specihe, still
he was prepared to vole for it
Before he sat down, he would state that other
charges of a serious characier had been made
against members ol this House, by a letter writer
for a Boston paper, based upon remarks made by
two honorable member? from the State of Ohio
on this floor, charges which were against the whole
body calculated to fix a stam  upon the charac,-.
