The following regiments, encamped in this vicinity, number as follows: The Second Regiment of the Empire Brigade, Colonel P. J. Claassen, East New York, numbers 700 men. This is the One hundred and thirty-second Regiment New York Volunteers. The Third Regiment, Empire Brigade, Colonel Leverick, East New York, numbers 500 men. The Fourth [Regiment], Empire Brigade, Colonel Burke, East New York, numbers 425 men. Colonel Allen's regiment, Numbers 145, Staten Island, numbers 614 men. The Second Regiment, Metropolitan Guard, Numbers 133, numbers 700 men. The Third Regiment, Metropolitan Guard, Colonel Benedict, numbers 600 men. This is all the information I have been able to receive about the regiments in this vicinity up to this hour. They are all delayed because they lack the minimum number of men, but measures are now adopted to consolidate and fill them all up this week. The regiments composing the Corcoran Legion are all very small, none numbering more than 400 men. What will be done with these I have not learned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. K. STRONG,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
