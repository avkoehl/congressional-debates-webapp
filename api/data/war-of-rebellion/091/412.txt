RECTORTOWN, VA., October 19, 1864.

(Received 1 p. m.)

Colonel J. H. TAYLOR:

Say to General McCallum that as long as this road is kept open to Piedmont it will be undesirable to furnish any guards for the other road. I do not regard it safe to diminish guards on this road, and thee are no other troops in the department available for that purpose. If I give up Piedmont, I can spare 400 or 500 men now there; but that would not be sufficient to guard the railroad from Manassas to Warrenton Junction. Show this to General Halleck.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

GENERAL: All quiet. In the affair at Falls Church Mosby captured 4 privates, 1 corporal, and 1 horse, Sixteenth New York Cavalry; killed 1 of the home guards (colored) attempting to escape, and captured 1 white man of some organization (Reed), who, from all evidence I can find, was murdered after capture. The Fifth Wisconsin has been ordered to its corps, via Martinsburg. No sign as yet of the enemy on the upper line of Potomac.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
