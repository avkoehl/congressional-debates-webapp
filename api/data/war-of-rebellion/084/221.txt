Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

The scout returned last evening. It went beyond Hickory Plains; saw nothing of the enemy, but learned that the attacking force was about 800 and came from West Point. Lieutenant-Colonel Stephens feels sure there is a large force at West Point, but that Shelby is at Jacksonport.

Colonel Geiger is not entirely well, but will go if needed. About 900 cavalry are ready to march. The information is conflicting concerning crossing of Bayou Des Arc on direct road; our scouts swam it a week ago. It is thought to be fordable by way of Hickory Plains.
