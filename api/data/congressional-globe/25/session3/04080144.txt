"Do you not consider that the breed of hogs has also di
mimshed, in consequence of this increase of dutv on salt?"
< Very materially , and as afurther proof of what! state,
we had a very extensive trade of £200,000 a year in hog ,
now not £10,000"
" W hit effect, in your opinion, would a great reduction
of the silt dunes produce in your business ?"
" I conceive it would restore our trade We should then
be able to supply the West India markets, arid other colonies,
with salted pork, cheapei and better than any other country "
" What is the quantity of salt used upon 100 weight of
pork, to make bacon?"
" In a manufactory of bacon, about 12 pounds, to cure
a small quantity, about 17 or 18 "
11   Testimony of Sit Thomas Típrnard —Extract
" I ventured to suggest that a tax on salt was fundament
ally wrong in principle, because it presses most on the
class least able to bear the weight, because of its unmoral
tendency, and because it deprives the nation of benefits
beyond measure greater than the whole produce of the nn
post The salt duties are about a million and a half ster
¡ing per annum, (about seven millions of dollars ) The
poor use most salt in proportion to their wealth , a cottager
m the country ten to one in proportion to a nobleman in
town But the bei cfits of which the nauon is deprived by
the salt dutips are not easily appreciated, or even nam
beted In agriculture and rural economy alone, the los*
in feeding caitle, sheep, and lugs, m restoring dimagid
provender, in manure, and In the effect on wazes, in ly,
without extravagance be supp ised to * xeced the whole
value oí the tax Lqtial, perh ip=, would be the gun to
our manufarturers uf woolen, linen, glass * artheuw ire,
soap, &c , See , &c , by the unrestrained use of muriate
and c irbonate of soda and muriatic aeid, of which our silt
mines and ocean afford supplies absolutely inexhaustible '
Mr B having read, or stated, thebe extracts to
ahow the useof salt m agriculture, said there were
many other witnesses examined, to prove that alum
salt, which the English usually called bay salt, be
cause it was made by solar evaporation, out of sea
water in the Bay of Biscay, and other bays, was
indispensable to the curing of provisions, for long
keeping, or for exportation, other articles connected
with agriculture, as cheese, butter, bacon, pickled
beef and pickled pork, and that the English Gov-
ernment permitted alum salt, under the name of
bay salt, to be imported both into England and
Ireland duty free, for these purposes, even when
the domestic manufacture of common salt in Eng
and far exceeded the home demand, and furnished
millions of bushels for exportation Henlso staled
that the committee of the [louse of Commons had
examined the first physicians of Great Britain to
prove the effect of a deficiency of salt in the pro
visions of the poor on their health, and that these
physicians uniformity testified that many diseases
of the poor, and especially m childien, were the
effect of using vegetables not sufficiently salted,
and fish and meat not sufficiently cured He also
stated that the committee had extended then ex
animation to the use of salt in various manufac
tones,and had established, by proof, that a vanety
of useful manufactories required the abolition of
the salt duty On this point, he lead extracts
from the examination of Samuel Parkes, Esq , an
eminent chemist of London, as follows

"What is your profession ? "
"1 am proprietor of the chemical works m Goswell
strett, London, and of other chemical works in Maiden
L me, Islington "
"Can you acquaint the committee what are the manufie
tures most alfected by ihe salt laws ?'>
"The manufactures of mineral ulk ili, crystalled soda,
muriatic acid   hard soap—distinguish* tl from  soft soap
Glauber salt, Epsom salt, magnesia, and sal ammoniac, ire
all materially atlectul by the duty on sail, but as common
salt, or on*1 orothei of the component puts ol common salt,
is made use of in the composition of a  great \ ariety ni  ir
tides that are employed in our mannlactures, it is difficult
to answ  r that question with precision "   *   *   *   ' Ri

" How does the price of salt affect the soap boilers ' "
"As it affects all other trades in which salt is employed "
" State the way in which it affects them "
" The cheaper it is, the cheaper they will have it, if they
buy it "
"Doyou know any other (manufacturing) purposes for
salt* "
" Yes , it is used in very large quantities by dyers when
it can be had cheap , and in a great variety ofotherwavs "
"With respect to the salting of hides, I learn from further
inquiry, that ihe butcher usually applies five pounds of salt
to every ox or cow hide which he has occasion to lay by
or to send to Ihe tanner at a distance "                           '

" 1 his at the Long Benton works only ;"
" Yes  
" Which is m ule from salt duty free ?"
" Yes    They have an exclu ive privilege "
When Mr B. had read these extracts, he closed
the book, and regretted that he could read no more
without encroaching too much on the time of the
Senate He said the whole volume «as replete
with the moat instructive information on thequah
ties of salt, the difference between that made by
solar evaporation, and that made by boiling, and
on its uses both in agriculture and mimii/ficritres
Ihe living Btock in England was belieied to be
advanced thirty-three and a third per cent in value
from the free use of salt, and for this purpose fire
made salt would answer sufficiently well To fish,
beef, bacon, pork, and butter, the sun made salt
was indispensable, and was admitted duty free
by the English for these pui poses, even while
making a supeifluity of common salt at home, and
exporting to the United States In manufactures,
it was pioved that there were nearly fifty varieties
of manufactures in which salt was used either in
its proper state, or in us chemical prepaiations of
alkali, muriatu acid, oxymumtic acid, sal am
moniae, or some other form The extent of this
demand fot salt in manufactures might be judged
of from a single example in England, that ot haid
soap It was computed that the manufacture of
hmi soap alone in England required two thousand
tons of mineral alkali peí annum This alkali
is obtained by a chemical process, either fiom
salt of from barilla or kelp Che barilla only
yields seventeen per centum of alkali, and kelp
only six per cent The decomposition of salt
itself is the cheapestmode of procuring the alkali,
but to make it the cheapest mode, the salt must
be duty free From this single example it might
be judged how much manufactmes required the
free use of salt In England it was computed that
manufactures alone weie annually mjuied by the
salt duty to a greater amountthan the whole piod
uct of the tax, and accordingly, for the joint ben
efit oí agriculluie and nianuiai tures, the silt duty
was totally abolished in that countty after the
publication of the tianscendent papers from which
extiacts have been read
Mf President, the small amount of this tax is
an aigument ulso used by gentlemen against its
repeal They say it is too small to be felt, and
that after 184Ü it will be still less 1 admit it is
too small to answei any of the purposes of a tax,
that it is too small either for protection or revenue
It answers no puipose in either way, but it is
large enough to do gieat mischief Tirst, it is
huge enough to keep up the fishing bounties and
allowances, and while any pait of it remains, that
dram of a quarter of a million per annum will be
kept up fiom the Treasury Secondly, it is large
enough to amount to neaily one hundred percent
onTuik's Island salt, to about one hundred per
cent on Portuguese and Spanish salt, and to near
one hundred and fifty per cent on the salt from
the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean and
Ailuatic seas It is large enough to amount to an
enoimous tix upon the value of this salt, the only
kind that will cure beef, pork, bacon, butter, either
for long keeping or for southern mukets But
they say it is to come down to twenty percent on
the value, that the compromise act, as it is called,
is to leduce it to twenty per cent on the value
1 answer, first, that this reduction is not to be at
tamed foi near four years, and when it is attained,
it is not to remain at that point for one instant
This famous act, sir, expires upon its own limita
tion at the moment when the clock strikes twelve
on the night of the 30th of June, 1842 It is an
act which provides for carrying all duties down to
twenty per centum by a given day, and which does
not provide for keeping them there one moment
after they get there1 They may all be raised
on the morning of the 1st of July, 1849, to any
amount that the Congress pleases, and this any
person may see who will take the trouble to read
the last section of the act It is then four years
before the duty is to ¡sink to twenty per centum
on the value, and after it gets there, it is not to
stay there a single moment, and so of all the duties
reduced by that act They are to go down to a
certain point, but they are not to remain there' and
Senate.
thus this famous act becomes the sheerest piece of
humbuggery which ever deluded and bomboozled
the understandings of a rational people1
The obligatory character of that act, which as-
sumed to be a sort of sub constitution, controlling
and silencing the actual Constitution for nine years,
I and  now invoked  to arrest our legislation, was
I scouted at the time, and among other declarations
| against it were a set of resolutions submitted by a
Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr Webster,] not
now in his seat, one of which ran in these words
"That no law ought to be passed on  the sub-
'ject of imposts containing any stipulation, expi ess
' or implied, or giving any pledge or assurance,
'director indirect, which shall tend to restrain
' Congress from the full exercise, at all times here-
' after, of all its constitutional powers* m giving
' reasonable   protection   to   American  industry,
' countervailing the policy of foreign nations, and
' maintaining the substantial independence of the
' United States "
This resolve, Mr President, was offered on the
14th of Febiuary, 1833, while the compromise act,
I so called, was depending, and was expressly di-
rected against that act   ltcontained the sentiments
of many, besides the mover, and has since been
sanctioned by a. decided majority of the Senate in
I a bolemn vote, and aftei   full debate     It  was in
I the passage, tin )ugh this body, in the session of
I 1-3G '7, of the bill to reduce duties to the amount
of three millions of dollars on a great variety of
articles, of which silt was one, and which passed
! the Senate by a majority of 27 to 18, mauger all
the invocations upon the sanctity of the so called
compromise act     The yeas were   Messrs   Ben-
I ton, Black, Blown, Cuthbeit, Ewing of Illinois,
Pulton,  Grundy,  Hubbard, King of Alabama,
Ring of Georgia, Linn, Lyon, Moore, Mouton,
I Nicholas, Niles, Norvell,   Page, Parker, Rives,
|   Ruggles, Sevier,  Strange,   Tallmadge,  Walker,
I   While, and Wright
J     This vote Mr  President, settles the question of
'   theobligatoiy force of thatsub constitution,which
was  airanged   by  two  Senators  in   secret,  the
knowledge of which, as it went on, was leaintm
this body from the letter writers—settled in secret
il meetings, from which a then Senator fiom New
I   Jersey,   (Governor   Dickerson,)   repiesenting   a
II   laige   manufacturing  interest,   was excluded, in
I   the formation of which, he told me that he was
| not consulted, and also told me that a Senator
from Massachusetts, representing the largest man-
ufictunng interest in the country,[Mr Webster,]
told him that he was not consulted, and had no
part in the making of the bill For one, I thpii
protested against the binding force of such legisla-
I tion, concocted in secret by twomembeis, brought
into the Senate at the last moment, when all was
cut and dry, and rushing it through under a
groundless ciy of dissolution of the Union Such
legislation had  no sanctity for me, and  the vote
I just read proves that it has no sanctity for the
Senate     Then why invoke it now'
Sti, I devote myself to the extirpation of this
salt tax, and its appurtenant abuses I care not
how long the tax may be i educed, I go for total
abolition, and will stop at nothing short of that
point Twenty per centum would, of itself, add
twenty dollars m the hundred to the cost of the
article, which is something to a farmer, but it is
not the nature of a duty to add nothing but its own
amount to the cost of the article on which it is laid
It adds, also, to it the merchant's profit upon that
duty, and all the expenses of wharfage, storage,
warehousing, caiting backwards and forwards,
wastage, losses by bad debtsor accidents, and, in
case of some articles, of which salt is one, it creates
an intermediate set of dealers in these  port towns,
who get all the article m theirown hands, and put
up the puce, in seasons of scarcity, to what they
please I hold 20 per centum to be neaily as bad as
twenty cents on the bushel, and go for total aboli-
tion,and afree trade,m this prime necessity of life
Sir, I totally object to the manner in w hich some
Senators undertake to calculate the burden of this
tax They take the naked duty, add it to the low-
est price of the salt, then make a division, and
show that it comes to but so many cents a head
on a population of sixteen nn'lions of souls This
is a counting house view of the question, it is the
view of a young clerk, standing behind a counter,
with a quill over his ear     It is not the view of a
