In May, 1863, fifteen miles of the track were taken up west of Suffolk, about the same quantity on the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, and the material thus obtained was stored for use elsewhere.

The Western Maryland Railroad and the Gettysburg Railroad, together with the Littlestown Branch, were operated from July 9 to August 1, 1863, for the purpose of removing the wounded from Gettysburg to distant hospitals.

On the Northern Central Railroad a large number of bridges were rebuilt in July, 1863, which had been burned by the enemy during their occupation of the west bank of the Susquehanna. Some track was railed on the Cumberland Valley Railroad that had been torn up and destroyed by the enemy, and a little work of the same kind was executed on the Franklin Railroad.

The operation of these various railroads is believed to have been eminently successful in furnishing promptly and fully all supplies for the army, and it is but justice to say that much is due to the hearty co-operation of the Quartermaster's and Commissary Departments, represented by General Rufus Ingalls, chief quartermaster of the Army of the Potomac; General D. H. Rucker, chief quartermaster, and Colonel A. Beckwith, chief commissary at the depot of Washington, and to the stringent orders of Major-General Halleck, General-in-Chief, preventing interference of the military authorities with the running of trains.
