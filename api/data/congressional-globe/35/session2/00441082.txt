THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
February 17,
poses to dissolve the Union after it is done? I ask
any Senator, who is blustering in the Senate or
elsewhere about dissolving this Union, how he is
going to do it?
We propose to do more; we mean to elect a
President who entertains the same views; and if
that be a just cause for dissolving this Union,
again i asli, how are you going to do it? I want
any man on this floor to tell me how he is going
to dissolve this Union, because we, the people of
the United States, see fit to exercise our constitu-
tional privilege. We mean to annul the Dred
Scott decision—no, sir, I take that back; it is no
decision. We do not think it is a decision at all.
The only point decided in that case was, that ne-
groes cannot come into court. That we accept;
that we cannot annul; that is decided; but the
stump speeches of Chief Justice Taney, and the*
other judges, were mere fanfaronade, meaning
nothing. It was not a decision of the court; and
if we elect our President in I860, as we are going
to doy that decision will never be made, I do not
say that that decision would not now be made. I
tiling if a case were before the court now, it would
make the Dred Scott decision legal; but the Su-
preme Court has always sided with the Admin-
istration in power. What did General Jackson
do when the Supreme Court declared the United
States Bank constitutional? Did he bow in de-
ference to the opinions of the Supreme Court ?
No, sir; he scorned the opinion of the Supreme
Court, and said that he would construe the Con-
stitution for himself; that he was sworn to do it.
I, sir, shall do the same thing. I have sworn to
support the Constitution of the United States, and
I have sworn to support it as the fathers made it,
and not as the Supreme Court has altered it, and
I never will swear allegiance to that. But I am
not quite through with the Union article. It says
further:
"The protection of property being lioxt to that of per-
son, the mos-t injpounut object of all good guvi-rrnnent, and
propeity in t-lavcr, being leoogrnzed by the Constitution of
the United States, a* well oti«uialiy by all the old thir-
teen Stares, we have nevet doubted that the emancipation
of slaves in thou? Sut**& where u previously existed, by an
arbitrary aci of the Legislature, was a gross violation of the
rights of property."
There you have it declared that abolition of
slavery in seven of the old thirteen States was un-
constitutional, and, according to the Dred Scott
decision, it was. 1 ask any man of common
sense—I will not ask a lawyer; 1 am no lawyer
myself - but I ask any man of common sense, if
he believes that the old thirteen States, seven of
which intended to abolish slavery within a very
few years, would have adopted a Constitution
•which prohibited them from doing the very act
which they contemplated doing instanter ? 1 ask
any man if lie believes for a single moment that the
Representatives of those seven States that in tended
immediately to abolish slavery within their bor-
ders, would ever have assented to a Constitution
which prohibited them from doing the very act l
which they proposed to do ? No, sir, the prop-
osition is absurd; and the judges of the Supreme
Court themselves did not believe it when they ut-
tered it. .No man of common sense can believe it.
It is not so.
But, sir, monstrous as is this proposition, mon-
strous as is ihe article which I have read, if the
Dred Scott decision be law it is all true; and it is
a mere question of time when every State of this
Union will become a slave State. If the honor-
able Senator from Louisiana, or any other man,
should see lit to take a thousand negroes into the
♦State of Michigan after that decision shall have
become tin; law, J dery any power short of a rev-
olution in this Government to preventhim, or take I
them from him. But, sir, i' is not law; it is not j
common sense; yet tins Dred Scott decision is the ;
only platform of the Democtutic party at the pres- i
ent time—the only issue before the country. I :
beg pardon; there is another issue, not yet per- '
lected, and that is tins $30,000,000 bribery and i
conujjtion fund. That is to be another plank in ;
the Demoeuiue platfoim. These two planks, the i
Died S^ott decision and Cuba, are to be the plat- ;
form th vt is to float the paity into power if it ■
ever arnves there; the Dred Scott decision and'
the £30,000,000 loan, with, perhaps, the honor- !
able^enatui Ico-n Virginia [Mr. Hunter] astride '
of tin tit; and with that platform and thai candi- ■
dafe, flie Democratic party will march to certain
defeat. i
But, sir, as this measure at the present time is
a financial question, I propose very briefly to al-
lude to the financial condition of the country. 1
look upon thisas the practical method of judging
of its merits. I hold in ray hand a letter written
by a very distinguished man, at present connected
with this Government, dated March 1,1852, and
addressed to a committee of gentlemen of Balti-
more. It is signed "James Buchanan." Itsays:
" We must inscribe upon our banners, a sound regard
for the reserved rights of the States, a strict construction of
the Constitution, a denial to Congress of all powers not
clearly granted by that instrument, and a rigid economy in
public expenditures.
"These expenditures have now reached the enormous
sum of $50,000,000 per annum, and unless arrested in their
advance by the strong arm of the Democracy of the coun-
try, may, in the course of a few years, reach $100,000,000."
Well, sir, " the strong arm of the Democracy"
has been managing our affairs ever since. The
President of the United States was then mistaken
a few millionsas to the expenditures; for the entire
expenditures of 1852, including payment of the
public debt, was only $44,481,447; but let him
have the advantage of his own figures. The
strong arm of the Democracy has had charge of
this Government from that time to the present,
and we have already reached the pciint that he
prophesied we might reach in a few years—
$100,000,000 of expenditure. It was demonstrated
to my entire satisfaction, and, I believe, to the
satisfaction of the Senate, by the honorable Sen-
ator from Kentucky, [Mr. Crittenden,]theother
day, that $100,000,000 would not pay the ex-
penses of Government for this year. I propose
a change; I propose that we try some other hand
at economizing the expenses of this Government.
But let me go on with the letter. Its writer says
further:
" The appropriation of money to accomplish great na-
tional objects, sanctioned by the Confutation, ought to be
on a scale commensurate with oui power and resources as
a nation ; but its expenditure ought to be conducted under
the guidance of enlightened economy and strict responsi-
bility. 1 ant convinced thai our expenses might be consid-
erably reduced, below the present standard, not only with
out detriment, but with positive advantage both J* the
Government and the people." *
If the expenditures could then be reduced below
$50,000,000 with advantage to the Government
and the people, what can be done now? Is there any
reason why our expenditures should be greater
now than they were in 1852? There is no reason
except that money may be used for purposes of
corruption; and I propose to examine into some
of these corruptions now and here. This letter
says further:
"An excessive and lavish expenditure of public money,
though in itself highly pernicious, is as nothing when com-
pared wuh tlte disastrous influence it may exert upon the
character of our free institutions. A strong tendency to-
wards extravagance is the great political evil of the present
day; and this ought to be firmly resisted."
Sir, I propose to resist it with all the firmness
God has given me. Now, let us look a little into
the expenditures of this Government. I hold in
my hand an official document of the Senate,
printed at the last session, giving the receipts and
expenditures of the Government from its form-
ation to 1857; and I desire to present some facts
which are shown by this document; and to be as
brief as possible, 1 will take it by decades, and I
will commence with the military service of the
country. In 1790, the whole expenses of the
Army amounted, in r<#nd numbers, to $917,000;
in 1800, §3,272,000; in 1810, $3,107,920; in
1820, $4,923,027; in 1830, $5,082,843; m 1840,
$6,504,830; in 1850, $6,838,919; and in 1857,
$18,614,594. This last sum does not include all
the expenditures of the Army for 1857; for Sena-
tors will recollept that one of the first bills we
passed at the last session was a bill making an
appropriation of $5,700,000 for deficiencies in the
expenses of the Army. Thus it will be seen that
the Army expenses alone, from 1850 to 1857/al-
most quadrupled, and this m a time of profound
peace. Does any Senator on this floor believe
there was any necessity for such an enormous
increase in the expenditures for the Army? Does
any man believe that a prudentadimmstiatiou of
the Government would not cut down the Army
expenditures atleast one half? Sir, the extrava-
gance is enormous and outrageous; and it requires
something more than the strong hand of the Dem-
ocratic party to rectify the evil. We will take it
in the strong hand of Republicanism, and then
wo will remedy it
But, sir, let us look at the Navy. In 1800,
the expenditures for the Navy were $3,042,352;
in 1810, #1,870,274; in 1820, #2,709,243; in
1830, $3,496,643; in 1840, #7,562,752; in 1850,
$9,571,646; in 1857, $14,117,434. Have we any
more ships, or any more guns, or any more effi-
cient force, to-day, than we had in 1850 ? I am
informed that we have not. On the contrary, it
is said, I know not with how much truth, that
our Navy is hardly as efficient as it was at that
time. At any rate, we have had no war, no ex-
traordinary demand for excessive naval expendi-
tures, and yet th£y have been reaching up until
they are $14,000,000.
There is one other account here, to which I wish
to call the attention of the Senate. It is headed
"miscellaneous expenditures." I do not know
exactly whatconstitute the miscellaneous expend-
itures of this Government, but I notice a most
extraordinary increase in them of late. I take it
for granted that what cannot be charged anywhere
to anything, goes down as miscellaneous. The
miscellaneous expenditures of this Government
in 1800 amounted to $312,823; in 1810, $650,514;
in 1820, $1,386,448; in 1830, #1,436,201; in 1840,
$3,243,649; in 1849, $3,595,853; and in 1857,
$20,442,860. I should like to know how these
miscellaneous expenditures have swollen so enor-
mously. There is another remarkable fact con-
nected with the great increase of the miscellaneous
expenditures of the Government. I notice that
when any very great outrage is about to be per-
petrated, the miscellaneous expenditures increase
enormously. In 1849 they were $3,595,853; and
they swelled in 1850, when the fugitive slave bill
was passed, to $7,122,970. Again, when the Mis-
souri compromise was repealed, I notice they
reached the enormous amount of $19,899,000;
and a goodly portion of this great increase may
be legitimately charged to the negroes. That in-
stitution has been a very expensive one to this
Government. It has cost, in my estimation, all
it is worth. When any great outrage was to be
perpetrated, the expenditures of all branches of
this Government have swollen enormously. So
when the Lecompton constitution came here to
be passed last winter. We have not got the ac-
count yet, but you will find an enormous expend-
iture m several of the Departments of thi#Gov-
ernment, which, the less said about, the better th^
parties interested will be satisfied.
As I said the other day, we have had a bill
under consideration in the Committee on Com-
merce to reduce the expenditures for the collec-
tion of the revenue over $600,000 a year, and we
have not commenced the work of reform even at
that. We have lopped off by that bill a thousand
useless employes of the Government, scattered
over the United States; but we have not probed
the wound to the bottom. As I have said, that
bill, if it becomes a law, will save $600,000 a year.
I propose, for a moment, to call attention to some
of the outrageous expenditures connected with
that Department. In the Passamaquoddy district,
at Eastport, Maine, the whole amount of revenue
collected for the year ending June 30, 1857, was
$14,285 33, and the expense of collecting it was
$22,357 71; and nineteen men were employed to
collect $14,000 of revenue. In Frenchman's bay
district, at Ellsworth, they collected $954 96, and
the expenses were $5,032 09; and it took ten men
to collect the #954. At Wiscassett, in Maine, you
collected #130 93; and it cost #7,359 09, and took
eight men to collect $130. These are samples.
At Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the revenue
collected was $5,530 54; the expense of collection
was #10,984 49, and twenty-one men were em-
ployed to make the collection. At Burlington,
Vermont, the revenue was #8,581 70; the expense
of collecting was #16,285 47, and thirty-three men
were employed to collect it. At Marblehead,
Massachusetts, the revenue was $250 85; the ex-
pense of collecting it #2,228 97, and nine men
were employed to collect it. At Plymouth, in
Massachusetts, the revenue collected was $395 12;
the expense of collection was #3,216 04, and six
men were employed to make the collection. At
Barnstable, Massachusetts,the revenuecollected,
was $1,46275: the expense of collection #11,953 20,
and nineteen men were employed to make the col-
lection. At Nantucket, Massachusetts, the rev-
enue collected was $95 81; the expense of collecting
it was $2,320 73, and three men were employed
in the collection. At New London, in Connec-
