there was a movement of troops in front of Taylor, but where to I cannot find out; deserters say that they know of no movement on their right. I find all about as usual. The rebels did make a reconnaissance with scouts along our picket-line in front of Opdycke. Two regiments from General Wood reported at early dawn; they are in line on the left of the cavalry. I will retain them there until evening unless otherwise ordered.

Colonel FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Since my dispatch at 8.30 a.m. the signal officer reports that the rebel line in front of Kirby's pickets has been strengthened by at least three regiments. This begins more fully to develop the movements of last night. The guns remain as before.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

My brigade officer of the day reports that by the aid of a fire in front of the enemy's works he saw five regiments passing to our left, and then the fire was put out. He also says that he could distinctly hear loud cries from women and children, as if praying, &amp;c. There is now quite a fire burning in the town. The shelling from the enemy has done me no injury, though uncomfortably close.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. M. KIRBY,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-I will be on the alert before daylight.

Brigadier General K. GARRARD,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Major-General Stanley reports that the enemy were marching last night toward our left. The major-general commanding directs that you send a scouting party in the direction of Decatur for the purpose of ascertaining if possible whether the enemy has moved, where he is, and what are his apparent intentions.

Yours, respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
