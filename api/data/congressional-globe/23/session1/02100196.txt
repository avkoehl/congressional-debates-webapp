THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 24,
Mr REED would enter his protest against the
manner in which memorials were this session pre
„entea by some honorable members, who took the
oeeagion of pre&entmg them to cast discredit upon
those who sent them He would deny that these
memorials had been got up foi any political pur-
pose whatever, for he knew that there was, in
many cases that he had presented petitions, the
existence of very great distress and suffering, solely
caused by the derangement given to the pecuniary
lelauons throughout the country In answer to
the charge made, that those who now called for
actioi, action on this subiect by Congress, to re-
store the country to its former s ate of prosperity,
continued to debate the subject, it was enough for
him, perhaps, to say, that the debate was notpro-
tracteu to prevent relief being given, but thatit was
done in total despair of effecting it m any other
way—that, by such debating, there would be a
change of opinion of those in power, if not in Con-
gress, as would ultimately lead to a change of
measures on their part It was hoped that in this
way, when the true condition of the country should
be made known, Congress would afford the relief
that was soughtfor so uigently He insisted that
those who alleged that there was no distress in the
cranny, were utterly mistaken in supposing so
The distiess, first felt on the sea board, was fast
spreading into the country, and if the honorable
membei could now congratulate his constituents,
who weie, as he said, engjged in the lumber
trade, from being at present exempt fiom it, he
could venture to predict such would not be their
case sixty days hence He objected strongly to
the memorials being slighted, because they had
tieen signed by those who had not supported
Geneial Jackson
Mr EVANS defended the character of the per-
sons who signed the memorial, and moved that it
should be printed
After a few remarks in reply by Mr PARKS,
the memorial wasoidered to be punted, and re-
fen ed to the Committee of Ways and Means
Mi HUNTINGTON presented memorials from
the Phcenix and Haitford Banks, Haitfoid, and
from four buiks in the city of Norwich, praying
the restoration of the deposites, and the recharter-
mg of the Bank of the United States, which were
relerred
Mr FOOT presented resolutions of the citizens i
of New Haven, in favor of the restoration of the I
deposites, and the recharter of the bank Refer '
red to the Committee of Ways and Means, and |
ordered to be printed                                                   I
Mr  SELDEN presented a memorial from the '
city of Troy, in i elation to the State of the cun ency
Referred to the Committee of Ways and Means,
and ordered to be printed.
Mr SHINN rose and said
1 have been requested to present to this House
a memorial from a part of the citizens of the coun- li
tyofBuilmgton,in theStateofNewJersey    The
memorialists, after stating the derangement of the
currency of the country, pray that the public de
posites be restored to the Bank of the United States
This, bii, 13 a large and respectable memorial,
signed, as is said, by twenty seven hundred and
eighty five persons, many of whom are my per-
sonal acquaintance and fnends     I move its lefer-
enceto ti e Committee of Ways and Means    This
memorial had been printed in theSenate, therefore
I do not move that course
Mr POTTS presented two memorials from his
constituents, repiesenting that there exists a gen
eral and severe embanassment, in currency and
business, attributing the same to the removal of
the deposites, and praying their restoration Mr
P said that he fully concui red with his constit-
uents as to the cause, remedy, and extent of the
evils which they represented to exist, and on his
motion the memorials were referí ed, and oidered
to be printed
Mr MUHLENBERG presented the memorial
of 1 850 citizens of Berks county, Pennsylvania,
disapproving the removal of the deposites and de-
manding their restoration as a measure of publ c
justice and expediency
tn presenting this paper, Mr M wished to be in-
dulged with some remarks, and he promised those
who had petitions to pi esent that they should be
very buef    He represented a district composed
of the single county of Berks, with a population
of 60,000 souls.   1 he 1850 signers to the memo-
' rial were a part of that population, and but a small
part of his constituents     He deemed it proper for
a representative to present any petition fiom any
I part of his constituents, whether he concurred
I with their views or not    In the present instance,
he differed tolo calo from the memorialists, and he
I believed that a large part of the citizens of the
county coincided with him in his views     He be-
1 heved that the restitution of the deposites would
lead to the recharter of the Bank       the United
States, to which result he would undertake to sav
that two thirds of his constituents was opposed
| What change of opinion would be produced by
the continuance of the present pressure and de-
rangement of currency, he was not prepared to
say, for he was neither a prophet nor the son of
a prophet     Time and  experience would show
These men were a minonty of his constituents,
but they were a respectable minority     He ob
1 served among the names, many of the highest
respectability,  whose  opinions  were entitled to
gieat respect     But the great mass of the signers
had always been opposed to the present Adminis-
tration , with how much effect, the result of the
election had shown    Another portion of the sign-
ers were friendly to the President and his Admin-
istration until the President signed the bank veto
message      Anothei  portion  were still warmly
attached to the President, but differed with him
in relation  to the policy of a  bank     His duty
compelled him to add, that by some pti ions b 
had been requested to say, that many weie induced
to add their names to this memorial bystatements
and  coloring which  were  unfounded  in  truth
Without expressing an opinion as to the expedí
ency of removing the deposites, hemust say, that
he was opposed to their restoration at the piesent
time, because it must have the effect to produce the
recharter of the present bank     Ihe one measure
would necessauly lead to theother    lfhethought
that the opinions of his constituents differed from
his own, he would not say that he would conform
his views to their opinions     No     An opinion
deliberately formed, wi'h reference to the interests
of the whole people, he would not compromise
But, sir, said Mr M , I would instantly lesign my
seat, and give my constituents an opportunity to
elect an individual who would repiesent their sen-
timents     But he believed that a laige majouty of
his constituents coincided with him in opinion on
this suSject     He was sustained in this belief by
two large meetings held in the same county, one of
them consisting of eight hundred citizens, with the
proceedings of which he had notthoughtproperto
trouble the House     As a mark of respect to the
memorialists, and to show for what purpose the
memorial was circulated, and what object it was
coveitly  and  insidiously made  to  subserve, he
would ask that the memorial be read
After the memorial had been read,
Mr   McKENNAN said,  he wished to ask
whether he had correctly undetstood his colleague
to say that the memorialists had approached their
object m a covert and insidious manner
Mr MUHLENBCRGdemed that he had made
any such charge upon the memorialists
Mr McKENNAN said his object was merely
to resistan attack which he supposed to be made
upon men with many of whom he was personally
acquainted
Mr BINNEY asked whether acopy of the me-
morial in the German language was annexed to it
Most of the subscribers were acquainted with no
other languape than the German
Mr MUHLENBERG replied, that there were
two copies of the memorial one m English, and
the othei in German, which last,foi convenience,
had been detached
Mr BINNEY would further ask whether it was
so detached by the gentleman who presented it >
'-     MUHLrMBERG     Certainly
Mr
Mr WATMOU&H desired to ask whether
his co'league, m the concluding remarks of his
speeeh--—
The SPEAKER interposed, and said it was not
in order to propose mtenogataries to members
Mr WATMOÜGH wished to know, he said,
whether his colleague did mean to say that sub
scnptions weie obtained to the memorial through
improper means, and that the doctrines contained
in it emanated from a quarter upon which the
people were not accustomed to rely The gentle-
man seemed to convey this idea, if so, knowing
the opinions of the people of Pennsylvania, he
would say that when the questions now agitated
were clearly presented to their strong and dis-
criminating minds, they would not be prevented
fiom coming to a decision, by the intimation that
their opinions came fiom the Philadelphia school
or any other quarter He had propounded the
questions, and he had no doubt that his colleague
would answer it with his usual promptness
Mr MUHLENBERG If my honorable friend
will take care of his own district, I will take care
of mine I am responsible to my own constituents
for my course here, and forbid any interference
of this kind 1 have spoken respectfully of my
constituents. I intended to convey the idea that
signers to the memorial were obtained with a view
to the recharter of the bank, whereas there is not
one word in the memonal about the recharter of
the bank If the question was put to his con-
stituents, whether they were in favor of General
Jackson, two-thuds of them would say yes, and
if they were asked whether they weie in favor of
the recharter of the bank, two-thuds of them
would say no
Mr McKENNAN asked how his colleague
could say that an attempt was made to mislead the
people by producing the effect of rediaitering the
bank, when theie was nothing of the kind on the
face of the paper He would undertake to say
that many of the signers to this papei were men
who would spurn the suggestion that any decep-
tion had been attempted
Mr MUHLENBERG had no doubt, he said,
that many men whose names were on this paper
would spurn the suggestion that they had attempt-
ed to make a false impression, but among the
large number of signers there were many other
men He would like to know how many of the
names subscribed to the memorial were known to
his colleague
Mr McKENNAN, instead of answering the
question, would, he said, ask his colleague to
state to the House the names of the underlings
to whom he had attributed deception His con-
stituents might then judge as to the co-rectness of
the imputation It was not for him to interfere
with his colleague and his constituents, but he
wished to vindicate respectable individuals from
unjust imputations
The SPEAKER asked whether the gentleman
fiom Pennsylvania intended to embiace the names
m the motion to punt
Mr MUHLENBERG said he did not.
Tne memorial was then ordered to be printed
Mr WAT WOUGH moved the printing of the
names appended to the memorial
Mr BINNEY said this motion was connected
with the inquiry as to the original memorial
Most of the names would be found in the German
character, and manyof the signers understood that
language better than the English He wished to
have the Gei man original before the House, as an
answer to the suggestion, whenever and wherever
it might be made, that the memonal had been sub-
mitted to the Germans in a language they did not
understand He could see no reason for printing
the names, unless the German copy was annexed
to the memorial
Mi MUHLENBERG rose only to explain the
circumstances in connection with the separation
from the memorial of the German translation
The original memorial, as brought to him, was
written in English and German. It was so much
mutihtej, that he handed it to the person from
whom he received it, to make a new copy for pre-
sentation to the House It was not proposed to
him, nor uid he think it necessarv to present also
the German copy He had no objection to the
presentation of the German copy. If gentlemen
wished it they could have it
Mr MERCER said that the memorial directed
to be piesented was written in two languages, and
therefoie the House was not put in possession of
the real memorial
Mr BINNEY would simply request thegentle-
man to hand the German copy to the Clerk
Mr WAYNE said if it would be supposed that
a «ingle individual who had signed the memorial
would not have ¡signed it, if the German copy had
