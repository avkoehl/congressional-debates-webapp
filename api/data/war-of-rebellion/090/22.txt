CAMP OF SMITHFIELD PIKE,

THREE MILES AND A HALF FORM SMITHFIELD, VA.,

August 28, 1864 - 8.30 p. m. (Received 1.30 a. m. 29th.)

The enemy yesterday and the night before moved from my front, concentrating at Leetown and Smithfield. To-day I moved on these points. The enemy last night and this morning moved from these points to Bunker Hill, holding the crossing of the Opequon, leaving their cavalry at Leetown and Smithfield. General Merritt, with the First Cavalry Division, attacked them at Leetown, drove them from that place, and, after a handsome engagement, routed them at Smithfield and drove them across Opequon Creek. The cavalry engaged was Fitz Lee's. The enemy's cavalry pickets on the west bank of Opequon were relieved by infantry about night-fall. The enemy are concentrated at Bunker Hill form all reports. Whether they have left that point for Winchester is doubtful. I will be able to find out in the morning. Several handsome cavalry charges were made in the engagement of the First Division. The enemy suffered quite severely. Our loss was not very heavy.

Averell, who was at Martinsburg, was obliged to fall back to a point between Hainesville and Williamsport. I think that he will be able to advance again to-day. The two divisions sent to the rear have not yet accomplished anything, even to giving me information whether the enemy had sent any considerable force of troops from the Valley. I wanted to get between Strasburg and the remaining force. For this reason I have remained quiet here for the last day or two. The reports of the people are that the troops have been ordered back to Richmond. As yet, I have no good reason to believe that any have left.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

P. S. - I have just heard from Averell. As I supposed, the affair was not of much consequence, and he is going back to Martinsburg.

CHARLESTOWN, W. VA., September 2, 1864 - 6. p. m.

Yesterday I directed Torbert, with his cavalry, to derive in the enemy's pickets on the Opequon as far as the Front Royal pike, and to reach the Strasburg pike if possible, for the purpose of gaining information. This was done, and it was found that none of the enemy's troops had, up to that time, left the Velley. To-day Averell attacked the enemy on the on the Winchester and Martinsburg pike, driving Vaughn's cavalry from Bunker Hill, capturing some of his wagon train and a number of prisoners. I have not yet received Averell's official report. The enemy's infantry commenced moving toward Winchester this morning. I will move to-night.

Major-General.
