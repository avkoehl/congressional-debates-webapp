Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

I have advanced my line on the left, north of R. Armstrong's house, to Crow house, making it nearly straight to little north of Thorn's. We did not get very near to enemy's works; encounter too much resistance; return of casualties not in. I am entrenching on the new line. I connect with Second Corps.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

Where does your left strike Hatcher's Run now?
