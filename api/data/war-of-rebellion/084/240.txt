I will send the force from Patterson to you at Bloomfield. They will reach Bloomfield Thursday night. Will be about 250, with two 12-pounder mountain howitzers.

Colonel TYLER,

Commanding Pilot Knob:

Send Major Wilson with all the cavalry you can spare and with the two howitzers to Bloomfield, there to await orders from Lieutenant-Colonel Burris, or to join him on learning where he is. Answer, saying what force you can send. Let them reach Bloomfield Thursday night at farthest.

HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., July 18, 1864.

Colonel TYLER,

Commanding Pilot Knob:

All right as to force going to Bloomfield and without rations. I want you to meet me, if convenient, at Potosi Saturday, where I go to attend that day an Order 107 meeting.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., July 18, 1864.

Colonel TYLER,

Commanding Pilot Knob:

The combined movement proposed by you is impracticable at present, because Colonel Burris has just gone on an expedition below New Madrid. His force is between 300 and 400. I think it would be well for you to send out a force of 300 and the howitzers under Major Wilson, to go by way of Chalk Bluff, where he will probably be able to form a junction with Burris. If he does not succeed in joining him, let him go on down until he finds the strength and place of the enemy, bringing out such Union men as he can find. The construction of the redoubt will be commenced soon, if that and the other business of the sub-district will require your presence and supervision. Answer.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
