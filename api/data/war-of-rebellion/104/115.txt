HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE,Starke's Wharf, March 28, 1865.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

In pursuance of directions from General Comstock, I have had the point known as the Deep Hole, or on the map as Point Zeb, examined, and can find seven and a half feet of water within 200 feet of shore. It would take two days to fix the road from the landing to the army and build the wharf at this place. I am using pontoon bridges for wharves at two points. Will by to-morrow evening have a permanent wharf. Have had a force to-day repairing road between here and the army. Will to-morrow put on still larger force and go forward and complete wharf, unless otherwise ordered. Shall I go forward or not?

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
