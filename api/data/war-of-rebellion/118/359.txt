Major General H. G. WRIGHT,

Commanding Department of the Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio.

GENERAL: In reply to the matter submitted in your indorsement on the letter of General White accompanying a report of Major Davidson of the capture and parole of certain officers and men by guerrilla bands I have the honor to sate that such paroles, though of doubtful force, have heretofore been recognized as binding by both parties, and Union troops so paroled will be considered as bound by their paroles until General Orders, Numbers 49, has been generally promulgated to the Army, after which time any officer or soldier violating any of its provisions by giving his parole improperly will be held as an offender and punished accordingly. I have consulted the General-in-Chief on this subject and the above are his views. Order Numbers 49 will be presented to the agent from Richmond for the exchange of prisoners and it is expected that the rebel authorities will be willing to adopt that order as their rule in relation to paroles, and an effort will be made by a mutual agreement of the agents for exchange to cancel paroles so irregularly given on either side.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
