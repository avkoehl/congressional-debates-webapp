CHARLESTON, W. V., August 4, 1864.

Major W. P. RUCKER,

Gallipolis, Ohio:

Nothing from Ballard. Captain Ramsay's company was attacked two days ago and all the men in the fort taken prisoners by Thurmond; about twenty. Ramsay was away with most of his company. Since horses have been so scarce there is some new order about offices buying Government horses which forbids, I think.

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, &amp;c.

MONOCACY JUNCTION, August 4, 1864.

Major General L. WALLACE:

Everything quiet along our line. Major Waite, at Muddy Branch, reports that men in citizens' clothing are patrolling the Potomac, and when they find our men separated from their commands they bushwhack them. These men are supposed to belong to a Lieutenant Mobberly's gang of outlaws. I have instructed my command not to bring any of them to my headquarters except for interment. I think the Potomac, up to Point of Rocks, well guarded, except against a large force. My men are throwing up earth-works at Monrovia and Mount Airy to protect themselves against cavalry. We have a large force at this point.

(Received 11.50 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff;

General Kelley telegraphs me that the enemy are at Springfield, McCausland [and] Johnson, awaiting re-enforcements. He wants me to send him troops, but do not think it advisable to send him those at Camp Reynolds, 300 to 400. By these days I hope to have an organization of all the able-bodied men in this city.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

PITTSBURG, PA., August 4, 1864.

(Received 9.20 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Enemy attacked New Creek at 4 p. m. Stil fighting, according to General Kelley, at 7 p. m. He estimated it to be the same fore which attacked Cumberland, 5,000 strong. I hope to be ready to meet them if they come north.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
