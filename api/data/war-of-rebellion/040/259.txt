BALTIMORE, April 26, 1863.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Harper's Ferry:

Send more force to New Creek, and on to Oakland and Rowlesburg. Wilkinson reports that rebels have reached Oakland and driven in pickets at Rowlesburg.

Two good regiments, the One hundred and fifty-first New York, Colonel Emerson, and Fourteenth New Jersey, Colonel Truex, are now at Monocacy as a reserve, and you can call for them at any time if you need them.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, April 26, 1863.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

Wires appear to be cut west of Piedmont. A train of stock-cars going west was captured at noon to-day at Altamont. If Jones' cavalry should return after this raid by turnpike, cannot Smith, from New Creek, aided by Campbell, from Romney, intercept him? The cavalry engaged in this movement of the enemy's must be overestimated. The body of Jones' force may have been left at Moorefield.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, April 26, [1863.]

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

Colonel Mulligan, with two regiments and a battery, has arrived at Grafton. What news this morning? Answer soon, as I am fearful our communication will be cut off by Jones, who is approaching New Creek.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

GRAFTON, VA., April 26, 1863.

W. P. SMITH,

Camden Station, Baltimore:

The Confederates are in possession of Oakland. Our telegraphic communication with Piedmont is cut off. I think things had better be removed from Piedmont, as I fear they will capture a stock train west, and may use it to make a descent upon Piedmont. I think passenger trains coming west had better not pass Cumberland until the road is known to be clear.

J. P. WILLARD.

BALTIMORE, April 26, 1863.

General JAMES S. WHEAT,

Wheeling, W. Va.:

Rebel cavalry have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Oakland.

You will call out your brigade immediately, and proceed to Grafton,
