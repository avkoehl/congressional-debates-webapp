Some time subsequently,
Mr. MAYNAItD said: I did not at the
time pay particular attention to the bill grant-
ing a pension to Harriet W. Pond, or I would
have asked some explanation of it, as it seems
to be a bill granting a pension to a woman who
has a husband living.
The SPEAKER. The Chair noticed at the
time the bill was read that it was a peculiar
bill.
Mr. BEATTY. The report accompanying
the bill explains it fully. 1 ask that the report
be printed in the Globe, in connection with
the bill.
No objection was made.
The report was as follows, made by Mr. Vax
Winkle, of the Senate:
The Committee on Pensions, to whom was referred
the petition of Mrs. Harriet W. Pond, respectfully
report:
That tlie said petition, with accompanying papers,
was originally referred to the Committee of Clainis,
who reported the tacts of the ease as follows, which,
after due examination, this committee adopt as cor-
rect :
She represents that she volunteered her serviccsto
minister to the necessities of the soldiers during the
rebellion; that she 1 etc her home in Old Town, Maine,
anil went out with the sixth Maine volunteers, and
continued an active attendant upon the sick and
djiug until the close of the war; was on thirteen
bat.le-fields and many heavy skirmishes, and among
other things assisted in preserving the names of the
d^ad and procuring the bodies of many for their
friends; and ppont freely of her own money for the
sick wounded, and dying to the amount of at least
$3 000 Her son, of that regiment, was killed in bat-
tle, but had expended$1,000 of his own money, at his
mother's request, for the same purpose.
She represents that in held and_ hospital sno
attended to the necessities of all soldieis alike, and
without anv expectation of remuneration, and
would not ask for it now but her health and consti-
tution have suffered by fatigues, hardship, and expo-
sure, ond -she is lett without means of support.
She further represents that at the battle ot Antic**
tarn while assisting in the removal of wounded sol-
diers a wagon was overthrown, killing three soluiers
ami breaking her own leer; that she renewed her
labors for the soldiers before her limb was strong,
causing it to be thrown out ot place, and erysipelas
set in, by which she is permanently disabled.
She shows, too, that in 18*53. while with the Maine
regiment, she was captured by the rebels, and by
them robbed ot $-50 in money, and clothing beside.
Iler affidavit shows that she expended $4,000 in the
service, and there is some corroborative testimony
upon the subject. The papers indicate her good
character and persistency in the work.
The Committee of Claims conclude their report as
follows:
Your committee are of opinion that compensation
in such cases, if made at all, should be by the States
whose regiments accept the services and permit such
attendance. This committee has hitherto declined
to recognizc such claims. But in eonsideration of
the injury she has received, and loss of her son, on
whom, it is alleged, she leaned for support, it may
be proper that a pension be provided for the peti-
tioner in this ease; and they recommend that her
papers be referred to the Committee on Pensions.
In accordance with this recommendation the said
petition and papers were referred to this committee,
who proceeded to consider the same. They do not
find that there is any law under the provisions of
which the petitioner is entitled to a pension, unless
on account of the death of her son, a private in the
service, who was killed in battle; but it does not
apÂ« ear that she was so dependent on him at and
before the time of his death as to bring her within
the said provisions.
If tins is so, the case is one of a class of which
several, within the last few years, after being pre-
viously referred to the Military, Naval, or other
Committees, have been sent to the Pension Commit-
tee. The class referred to consists of cases in which
relief or reward is asked of the Government on
account of alleged exemplary services in the Army
or Navy. It is evident that the consideration of meh
cases does not fall within the proper duties of the
Coinmittoc on Pensions. They have, however, for
two or three years reported on them, usually ad-
versely, or have asked to be discharged from their
further consideration, not because they had been
improperly referred, but as a conclusion from the tacts
presented. Many ot these cases have askedadouble
or increased pension for the widows of officers of the
higher rank, the rato not increasing after the rank
of lieutenant colonel is reached in the ascending
scale. Such increase not being allowed by law.it
will be readily peu-e ved that what is a^ked in such
cases is a mere gratuity. For at least two years past
no such case bus been reported on favorably by this
committee. It they approved such increase, they
would deem it their duty to report an amendment to
the general law, increasing the rates of pensions in
the cases mentioned, thus putting all oil the same
footing.
There are, however, in the ca^e of the petitioner to
whom this report more particularly relates, some
facts at least analogous to the cases in which pensions
are allowed by law. The petitioner had devoted
herself to the service of her country by administering
to the wants of sick and wounded soldiers, and this
for years continuously; and while actually agisting
in removing some of the wounded from the battle-
field of Antietam, an accidcnt by which three of her
charge wcro killed made her a cripple lor life. In
consideration of this the committee submit to the
Senate the accompanying bill granting her the pen-
sion of an acting assistant surgeon, as in her own
right, fiora the time she left the Army during her
natural life.
It is proper, in explanation of some of the phrase-
ology of the bill, to state that since the war the peti-
tioner, who during its continuance was a widow, was
again married; but that her husband is himself
greatly disabled by disease contracted while an offi-
cer in tho Army during the war, and unable to con-
tribute to her subsistence. In ordinary cases pen-
sions are not granted to married women, but as in
this ease tho pension, it granted, is in consideration
of her own personal services and permanent dis-
abilfy, the committee have sought and intended to
make it payable to her in her individual right until
her death.
