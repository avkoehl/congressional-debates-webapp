Major-General HANCOCK:

Your dispatch of 11 p. m. received. The major-general commanding directs that you do not withdraw your line of battle unless absolutely compelled to do so. He suggests that you protect your flank be refusing your right.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 11.35 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Your instructions will be obeyed, but it will put my whole corps in a weak line; the two flanks being across the creek, and the center unable to cross, and with such an extended line, I cannot have any troops available for other purposes. The line I now hold is not of value, unless an assault is intended, and it is desired to mass troops close to the enemy. I can hold nearly the same ground, with skirmishers and artillery, from my old lines.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

The right of General Birney is over a half mile in front of the Hanover Court-House road.
