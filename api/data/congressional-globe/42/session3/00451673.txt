Jefferson did not have those, because, being
a Virginian and living in the neighborhood, he
had his own horses, which were not a chiefly
advanced in years," but he took commutation
for his horses instead. So did Madison. Now
the President finds his own horses, and I heard
in the last campaign something said about the
number he had. He is a lover of horses and
furnishes his own.
I find in looking over in degree we do not
raise the President's perquisites, if that be the
word, in what the country supplies him with.
1 have a report of the present furniture of the
White House to which I shall call the attention
of members. It shows while increased in
number they are not increased in degree, and
we do not furnish the President as much as we
used to do.
