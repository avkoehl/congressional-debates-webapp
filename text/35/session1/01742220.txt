THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 18,
But, sir, when I look at the bill which the Com-
\ Aiittee of Ways and Means have reported to this
"WHouse, i am not prepaied to say that these ap-
propriations were omitted from motives of econ-
omy. I find on page 10 an item for the comple-
tion of the Washington Aqueduct, $8U0,000; one
for the Capitol extension, $1,000,000; and one for
theextensionof the General Post Office, $100,000.
Enormous sums of money are asked for for the
completion of public buildings here in the District
of Columbia. I see no reason why the same rule
should not apply throughout the whole country.
If the Government, from motives of economjr, is
not prepared to complete its buildings in diffeienl
parts of the United States, let us make the rule
general in its application, and stop the progress
of buildings in the District of Columbia, as well
as in the States. The same remarks that apply
to custom-houses will apply also to marine hos-
pitals. The third class of appropriations is for
fencing, grading, paving, and furnishing build-
ings which will be completed before the next ses-
sion of Congress. [L-Iere the hammer fell.]
Mr. LETCHER. Ooo of the propositions em-
braced in this amendment is for §360,000 for the
custom-house at New Orleans—a custom-house
which has already had expended on it by the Gov*
ernment a sum of*$2,G75,258; and which has sunk
an average depth of fifteen and three fourths inches
since it was commenced. How long will it be
after you pile this stone on it 
Mr. ECJSTIS. Will thegentleman permit me—
Mr. LETCHER,. The gentleman will excuse
me, as I have but five minutes to reply to the gen-
tleman. I refer the gentleman to the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury for the accuracy
of my statement. It is sinking still; for, in the last
year, it has sunk on the average two inches; and
the more you pile upon it, as a matter of course
the more it will continue to sink. Then, besides
all this, here is New York, the great importing
port of this country, where a custom-house was
built for $1,105,000) which answered all the pur-
poses of the Government in 1842; while $2,670,000
has been expended on the custom-house in New
Orleans, and $9,000,000 will probably be demand-
ed to complete it. And here let me tell thegentle-
man that he isundera slightmistake when he says
that the New Orleans custom-house is being built
by contract; and there again I refer him to the re-
port of the Secretary of the Treasury, where it is
stated, on page 134, that it is being built by the
Government.
Now, let ine take anothercase: here is Oswego,
in New York, where $113,000 lias been already
appropriated to build a custom-house, and where,
according to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, $12,000 has been paid for a job, and
a contract made to build it for $77,000. There
is $89,000 for which it was to have been com-
pleted, while there has been already appropriated
$113,800, and they are here no w asking for §10,000
more. Worse than that, at that point, after taking
the postage and the revenue, the Government is
annually left in debt $6,020.
Here is Cincinnati, it costs $6,437 53 to sup-
port the sailors at the hospital, while the whole
income is but $2,000. They have expended there,
as well as I recollect, about one hundred and thir-
ty-six thousand dollars to build the marine hos-
pital, and they want $50,000 more.
Here is Belfast, in Maine, where you are ask-
ing money to complete a custom-house—where
the Government gets one hundred and sixty-one
dollars each year, after taking the whole revenue
and postage, and where they have got $18,000.
Here is Ellsworth—the same over again. Now
what I have to say to the gentleman from Louis-
iana is this: the custom-house at Oswego was
contracted for to be built for $77,000, and the lot
only cost $12,000. They have had §113,000 ap-
propriated, and now they want more money to
complete it. There is twenty thousand dollars
odd, over and above the amount appropriated for
the purpose, and yet they ask for more. I refer
gentlemen, for full information on the subject, to
the following tables:
