CHATTANOOGA, February 29, 1864.

Major-General GRANT:

I have given orders for General Matthies to rejoin his command. He will start to-morrow. Has General Schofield been directed to relieve Granger and McCook and send them to me? I wish to place Granger's troops in front of Cleveland, protecting the road from there to Loudon; one or two regiments of McCook's cavalry at Calhoun to prevent any flank movement of the enemy from Dalton in that direction. The balance of his troops to cover and observe our front. I have been making arrangements to-day to commence the reconstruction of the railroad between this and Dalton.
