ASHLAND, June 9, 1864.

General R. E. LEE:

Head of column reached this place at 12 m. to-day. It is reliably reported that Sheridan, with two divisions of cavalry, numbering about 5,000, with fifteen pieces of artillery and fifteen wagons, encamped last night at Reedy's Mill, Caroline County. He is reported moving to-day toward Chilesburg. His advance reached that place at 2 p. m. Prisoners taken from him say that he is going to assist Hunter to join Grant.

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864--7 a. m.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

All quiet this morning. Affair of yesterday demonstrates fully bad system of defensive works constructed for Petersburg. When will our engineers adopt strong detached inclosed works in preference to elongated and weak continuous lines requiring a large army to hold them?

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
