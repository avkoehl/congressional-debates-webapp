HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, May 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General ARNOLD,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: By direction of the major-general commanding you will detail 200 cavalry to report promptly at 3 a.m. to-morrow to Brigadier-General Emory, commanding Nineteenth Army Corps. They are to accompany a brigade of infantry down the river to Smith's plantation. Three steamers and two gun-boats as guard have been ordered to procure all the forage between Alexandria and that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIV., DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, La., May 7, 1864.

Major G. B. DRAKE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Gulf:

MAJOR: I regret to be obliged to state that the condition of my cavalry is such that for any immediate operations requiring energetic action it is utterly unfit. The men are able to endure much more, although fatigued, but I believe one-half of my horses would be completely broken down if compelled to move to-night or to-morrow on a scout. Since I have had this command every portion of it has been very severely worked, and it is now in so crippled a condition that, for the benefit of the service, I am compelled to make this statement. Without careful husbanding of its strength, I think the cavalry force can be of no decided advantage to this army.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD ARNOLD,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIV., DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, La., May 7, 1864.

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Gulf:

MAJOR: Permit me to respectfully renew my application that Battery F, First U. S. Artillery, which has been organized as horse artillery and designed for the cavalry service, be assigned in orders (it has already been informally assigned) to this division.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD ARNOLD,

Brigadier-General.
