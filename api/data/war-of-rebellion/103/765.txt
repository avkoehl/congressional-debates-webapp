LEXINGTON, KY., February 24, 1865.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

All quiet except guerrillas. Flag of truce here a little tangled, as General Burbridge is relieved. I asked information from General Palmer. I consider it very unsafe for it to be here.

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GREENSBURG, KY., February 24, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch received. Flag of truce ought to be disposed of immediately. Scouting parties should be kept beyond Mount Sterling. It would be well to direct Colonel Gibson to look out in direction of Pound Gap. I will see General Palmer Monday night.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY, Lexington, Ky., February 24, 1865.

Brigadier General B. W. DUKE, C. S. ARMY:

GENERAL: Your information that I propose to hold your command responsible for the murder of negro soldiers under my command at Saltville in October, 1864, is incorrect. I have ascertained what troops are responsible for the outrages referred to, and should an opportunity occur I shall hold them to a strict accountability. The murder of Lieutenant Smith at Emory and Henry Hospitals by Champ Ferguson was one of the most diabolical acts committed during the war, and I am surprised at its being passed over without notice by the Confederate authorities. Should he or any of the band that accompanied him on this occasion fall into the hands of U. S. forces they will not be treated as prisoners.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY, Lexington, Ky., February 24, 1865.

Colonel D. Howard Smith, C. S. Army, bearer of a flag of truce from Brigadier-General Echols, will return to Virginia via Mount Sterling and Prestonsburg, and is authorized to await at the latter place the arrival of Miss Breckinridge, who has been granted permission to go through the lines to Virginia.

By command of Bvt. Major General S. G. Burbridge:

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
