at least of being well founded; and declares
that in accordance with the suggestions of the
Secretary of the Navy in his iate report the

Mr. DAVIS. I object.
Mr. WOOD. 1 move to suspend the rules.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I cannot yield
for that purpose.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks the gen-
tleman from New York made his motion in
time.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I did not yield
the floor for that purpose. I yielded only for
such matters as could be considered by unani-
mous consent. That was the condition on
which I have all along allowed motions to be
made.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understood the
gentleman as yielding to the gentleman from
New York to offer that resolution. If he yields
he cannot prescribe conditions, and if the gen-
tleman to whom he yields moves to suspend
the rules it is beyond the power of the gentle-
man from Ohio to object.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. All I fear is
that the resolution will take up time.
Mr. WOOD. I demand the yeas and nays
on the motion to suspend the rules.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. SCOFIELD. I call for the reading of
the resolution.
The Clerk again read the resolution.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I hope there
will be no objection to that.
Mr. WOOD. Then why did you object?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I did not object
to the resolution.
Mr. WOOD. Everybody objected on that
side of the House.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Nobody is
opposed to it.
Mr. LOGAN. I am for it.
Mr. WOOD. Very well; then why not say
so before?
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Davis] insist on his objection?
Mr. DAVIS. No, sir; I do not.
The resolution was then entertained by unan -
imous consent, and agreed to.
REPEAL OF CIVIL-TENURE ACT.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I yield now for
the last time to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, [Mr. Butler.]

the Committee on the Judiciary, reported a bill
(H. R. No. 574) to repeal several acts relating
to the tenure of civil offices; which was read
a first and second time, recommitted to the
Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered to
