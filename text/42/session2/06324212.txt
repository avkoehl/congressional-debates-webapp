As Rood evidence of tho economy of tho pres-
ent Administration aa can bedesirod may bo found
in tho following illustration :
In 1860 the customs collections were 853,187,511 87,
and the cost of collecting the same was #3,324,430 53,
or 6.25. In 1871 the eoUoctions wore $206,270,408 05,
and the cost of ooliecting $6,560,672 61, or 3.11 [-, less
than one half of the amount whioh it cost the
Buchanan administration in 1860.

ADJOURNMENT OVER.
Mr. DAWKS. I now yield the remaining
portion of the time to the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr. Garfield.]
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I desire to
call attention of the House to the fact that
three of the appropriation bills are still pend-
ing. Those three bills are still in the Senate,
and will not be likely to reach us for two days.
If we meet again on Friday morning and work
vigorously 1 believe we can finish those bills
before the day fixed for final adjournment.
I shall therefore move that we adjourn over
until Friday.
Mr. STEVENSON. I hope not. Let us
remain here and attend to business.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I move that
when the Ilouse adjourns to-day it be to meet
on Friday next at eleven o'clock.
Mr. S l'BVENSON. Let us know for what
purpose that motion is made.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Gentlemen on
all sides of the House have expressed a desire
that we shall adjourn over until Friday morn-
ing, and no committee, so far as I know, is
presenting business which needs to he pressed
before that time.
The motion of Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, was
agreed to.
Mr. RANDALL. I move that the House
do now adjourn.
D8K OF COMMITTEE-ROOMS.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I desire
to offer the following resolution :
Revolved, That tho Speaker order tho Doorkeeper
of the House to prevent strictly the occupation of
uny of the offices and rooms assigned by the Speaker
and by orders of the House to the use of «he several
officers and committees of the House by any person
whomsoever during any recess of the Ilouse, with-
out the written consent of the officer having such
otiico in charge, or of the chairman or chairmen of
the committee or committees to whom sueh room
has been assigned.
Mr. PLAT1\ I object.
Tho SPEAKER. The adoption of that
resolution will not affect the committee-rooms
the use of which is given to the committees of
the two political parties.
Mr. PLATT. Will it not prevent the con-
gressional executive Republican committee
from having the use of the rooms assigned to
them ?
The SPEAKER. It will not; because that
is done with the approbation of the Speaker
of tho House or of the Doorkeeper.
Mr. ELDREDGE. I should like to know
what is the object of this resolution?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I will
state the object of the resolution. It has been
found that during the recesses of Congress,
unauthorized persons, messengers and others
who have been discharged, having keys to the
several committee-rooms, have gone into thera
and occupied them for proper and sometimes
improper purposes. To stop that is the object
of this resolution.
Mr. KERR. Would the word "recess"
apply to the adjournment of the House with-
out day ?
The SPEAKER. Of course the Chair would
so construe it.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Every
chairman of a committee will have his own
room in charge under this resolution. The
object is simply to prevent the unauthorized
use of committee-rooms during the recess by
people who have no right to them.
Mr. KERR. I am not aware of any abuse
heretofore of these rooms. I do not know
any reason why the resolution should pass.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I move
to suspend the rules.
The rules were suspended, (two thirds hav-
ing voted in favor thereof,) and the resolution
was adopted.
RAFAEL MADRAZO.
Mr. MARSHALL. I am instructed by the
Committee on Appropriations unanimously to
report a bill (H. R. No. 2972) for the relief of
Rafael Madrazo.
The bill was received and i-ead a first and
second time. It authorizes and directs the
Secretary of the Treasury to pay to Rafael
Madrazo, owner of the bark 'l'eresita, which
vessel was illegally captured by the United
States steamer Granite City on the 16th day of
November, 1863, near the mouth of the Ilio
Grande, a restitution of which was ordered by
the district court of the eastern district of
Louisiana after sale of said bark and the dis-
posal of the proceeds of the salethereof, under
the order of the court, in the First National
Bank of New Orleans, which said judgment of
restitution was afterward, at the December
term, in 18(56, of the Supreme Court of the
United States affirmed, a sufficient sum, not
exceeding $10,359 20, out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to re-
store to said Madrazo, or to his lawful assigns,
without interest, the proceeds of said sale after
deducting therefrom whatever sum may have
been recovered from said bank, either before
or after the failure thereof, said bank having
failed shortly after the deposit of the pro-
ceeds aforesaid.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. This is the
unanimous report of the Committee on Ap-
propriations.
Mr. HOLM AN. How did that subject come
before the Committee on Appropriations?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. It was regu-
larly referred to the Committee, and was in-
serted in the general appropriation bill, but
was thrown out on a point of order.
Mr. MARSHALL. If the House will per-
mit me, I will state briefly the facts of the~case.
The bark Teresita belonging to a Spanish sub-
ject, was illegally siezed by the United States
steamer Granite City. Proceedings were in-
stituted in the court in New Oileans, and
the bark was ordered to be sold. On the
final trial there was an order of restitution.
But in the-mean time the bank in which t,he
proceeds of the sale were deposited, had failed,
and the owner of the vessel has never received
the money. The proceedings were brought to
the Supreme Court of the United States, and
the decision of the court below was sustained.
And this bill is simply for the purpose of
returning to this man, the owner of the vessel,
the net proceeds of the sale of the vessel
seized and illegally disposed of by the author-
ities of the United States. It is the unaui-
