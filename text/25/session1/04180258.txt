Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Mercer.
H. of Reps.
his estimates to the extent of five nulhon<> It
would be a sufficient answer to his inconsistent re
projf of the extravagance of the last Congiess,
which I am not bound to vindicate, as, I trust, I
have shown, that four and a half of these five mil
lions consisted of appropriations lor the Florida
war and the payment of the outstanding claims of
certain volunteers, which originated subsequently to
the date of those estimates
I desire not to be misunderstood by the gentleman
from South Carolina or any other member of the
Committee.
I beg, Mr. Chairman, not to be considered as de-
nouncing the past expenditures of this Government,
where they have been discreetly applied to the in
temal improvement of our count!y On the con
trary, when I recollect that twenty years ago, the
spirit, which now animates this vast republic, from
its céntie to its remotest extremes had scarcely
penetrated south of the Potomac, I gloiy in the re
flection that, through its beneficent agency, the re-
sources of our common country have been explo-
red, and its capacity for improvement demonstra-
ted , that its loitiest mountains have been subdued,
and the navigation of its noble rivers unlocked by
the inspirations of science and the labois of art,
and, above all, that our people, once severed by
natural barriers, have turned these very impedí
vnents mto facilities of intercourse and bon Is of
perpetual union Sir, m whatevei paity I mav be
ranked by others, claiming, as I do, independence
of all, and asking favors of none, I am no nullifier,
and I most truly rejoice, that the State which the
honorable member from South Caiohna so ably
represents, is about to derive fiom the accomplish-
ment of an entei prise, worthy of the age, a new at-
traction to that union, in a commercial connexion
of her great southern emporium with the noblest
rivers and the fairest cities of the west
The power of this Government to make internal
improvements, t consider of diminished value,
when I behold the alacrity and zeal with* which the
several Stales are superseding the necessity oí its
exertion ^Whenevei its great purposes are accom-
plished, I will abandon its use with fai greater
pleasure than I have felt in sustaining it, but, until
men, I am prepared to meet any lepioaches which
it may bung upon its friends, from whatevei quar-
ter they may proceed
I am at all limes ready to vindicate the mode in
Which this power has been exercised, by that com
mittee, of which I have so long been the drudge I
aver, sir, without a fear of contradiction, that, so
far from the power of internal improvement having
been abused by that committee, as an instrument
for the pathal distribution of the public benefit,
Which it is designed to dispense, their never his
been a moment when an efiort, so un woi thv, w ould
not have been spurned with disdain
The committee will pardon a dtgiession piovok
ed by a charge which I could not but regard as
apph'able, m part, at least, to myself, since the
small appropriation of the last Congiess, to the pur-
chase of sites fol marine hospitals m the west,
sprung fiom arepoitof the Committee on Roads
and Canals, pursuant to an instruction of the late
House of Representatives
In leturmngto the path I had left, I have to invite
the earnest attention of the committee to a palpable
disagreement between the Treasmy estimates of
the probable necessities oí the Government dunng
the last quarter of the current year In his letter
of the 5th instant, Mr Woodbury computes the
' outstanding balances at the expiration of the year"
to amount to "aboutsixteen millions," asum which,
he adds, "does not diffei much fiom then amount
at the close of the lislyeai ," and this am unt, I dis
cover, from his letter to the Senate of the 14th of
Januaiy last, to have been $16,802,070, an amount
obviouslymuch nearer seventeen, than sixteen mil-
lions But, in reply to a resolution of this house,
inquiring what objects of public expenditure may
be wholly dispensed wnh or will bear a material
leduetmn, during the present year, the Secretary
expressly tells us, that "a minute and critical ex
animation, on tins point, was instituted in May last,
and the result of it vv as, that enough could and would
be postponed, till next v ear, to amount to fifteennul-
hons," "consequently," he adds, " the expenditures
during the present yeai were estnnxted iiiinyie-
cent ieport, upon that basts" To exclude any pos-
sible misconception of the grounds or extent of his
estimate, he subjoins that, "after eveiydelay which
thepnblic expenditure would permit, it is, therefoie,
expected that of the outstanding appropnations,
now exceeding twenty-four millions, not much over
nine millions will be necessanly lequired to be ex-
pended dunngthe residue of the year, the result
cannot be necessarily varied from that to which the
Department arrived last spring "
Thus, within a fortnight of each o'her, and from
the same data, the Secretary deduces two estimates
of the v ants of the Treasuiy during the residue of
the year, varying from each other to the extent of
a million of dollars, or, as might be justly contend-
ed, a million and a half
In the eatly age of this Government, Mi Chair-
man, a million of dollars was a sum sufficient to
engage the senous attention of this house, the con-
stitutional guardian of the public purse Are wc
to look for an explanation ol this palpable inconsis-
tency, between the con'empoiaiy estimates of the
«ame officer, to carelessness in the discharge of his
duty"* The extraordinaiy length of the Treas uy
reports, «mce he ha= been at the head of that De-
partment, precludes so unpisf a suimise Are we,
then, to seek foi it in an unexpected opposition to
the bill on ycir table, which, after gliding speedily
through the Senate, has been so long obsti ucted in
this house as to require greater urgency to pass it
through1
Sir, I have again to complain of palpable omis-
sions, as well as contradictions, in the elaborate re-
ports of this officer In reply to the late daect m
quiry of this house, we had every reason to expect
that the Secretary of the Treasury would correctlj
appuze us, not only of the sum of the balances of
formei appropriations which would remain unex-
pended at the end of the year, but of the part of
those balances which might he ultimately dispensed
■with A heavy cloud is allowed to rest over the
prospects of the ensuing year, without the 'lightest
effort to dispel it And yet there will not be found
in the annual reports of this officer for a series of
years, a similar omission
Tn his íeport of December last, in which he un-
denated, by more than two millions and a quarter,
the balaiif e-> of appiopnations whieh wc uld be nn
expended at the end of that month, he computes
the pait of those balances which could be applied
mail of the appiopnations of the ensuing year,
without a re-appiopnation, at more than three mil-
lions, and the part which would be earned to the
surplus fund, under a provision of the existing laws,
to very near two hundred thousand dolíais The
|wo sums, together, constituted nearly one-fifth of
the total estimated balance The actual balances
of the appropriations of former ycais unexpended
on the 31st of December last, is stated in the Sec
retary's communication to the Senate of the 14th of
January last to have been as we have seen, n ally
seventet ti millions, and no just reason can be as
signed for computing those which will exist at the
end oí the present, or the portion of them which
may be caí i led to the account of the ensuing year,
at a less amount
That I maybe better understood by a part of the
committee, allow me to remai k that those balances
of appropnations arise from no superior economy
on the part of the Executive, as the large amount
which they had reached on the 1st of Januarv last,
combined with the desire manifested by the Secre-
tary, to expend them, sufficiently demonstrates To
some extent, they must ever exist, since they spring
from the nature of the objects to which the public
revenue is applied
The present Chief Justice, when Secretary of the
Tieasury, stated that those balance1- had averaged
about five millions thiee hundred thousand dollars
for the four years pi ecedmg his report of December,
1833 In estimating the balances of appropriations
at the end of 1834, he assumes tint "a por'ion of
the expenditures," for which hesubmtts an estimate,
"will not be used during the year, that balances of
appiopnations, equal to the amount at Hie close of the
cuirent yen, will, in like manner, remain m the
Treasury at the ei d of the succeeding j ear," and
he wisely suggests that " it is not iteamary to ->ane
money for the public use sooner than it a ill be needed '
Dunngthe frugal admmistiationsof Washington
a id his immediate sucees«or,the elder A dams, these
balances were mconsideiable compared with then
present extent Their augmentation has, doubtless,
been piomoted by a favorite doctrine of the onpo-
sition to those administrations, a doctime which
contributed, tn no small degree, to its triumph in
1801 It had been the practice todistnbutethe esti
mates, and the correspondent appiopnations for the
maintenance of the Government, undei a fewgene-
l al heads of expenditure, and to allow the excess of
an appropriation, undcroue head, to supply any un-
foreseen deficiency that might arise under any other
head of analagous character The balances of
appropriations, under this system, were few in num-
bti and inconsiderable in amount
This usage was condemned for its supposed ten-
dency to dimmish the responsibility andenlarge the
powei of the Executive ltwascharged upon par-
ticular officeis that, under cover of the protection
which it afforded for the misapplication of the pub-
lic money, peculation had arisen, and one oí the
earliest measures of the successful party was an
inquiry into the conduct of the ex Secretary of
State, Mr Pickering This inquiry was instituted
and conducted by a distinguished member of this
house, from Virginia It ended m the complete
vindication of the ofhcei, but led to the praetice of
multiplying the specific objects of appropriation,
and lestrietmg the disbursements foi those objects
to the sums seveially appropriated As the excess
of one appropriation was no longer permitted to sup-
ply the deficiency of another, however close might
be the affinity between them, and the precise sums
lequired foi each could not be foreseen, it became
indispensably necessary to enlaige each of the nu-
meious estimates to which the new usage gave rise,
so as to guard again t any possible deficiency of
means Hence an unexpended balance would be
found at the end of every year, undei many, if not
all, of the numeious heads of appropriations The
aggregate of these balances became larger as the
public expenditure mcieased with the expansion of
the levenue and the multiplication of its objects
As some merit is, moieover, implied m keeping the
expcndituie for any object withm the estimate of
its cost, so both the estimates and the appropriations
have been giadually and propoitionabiy enlarged.
Whethei economy m the public expenditures
has been piomoted by tnis modern and still populai
system of appropnation, I shall not stop to investí-
gale ny piesent purpose will be answered, if I
shall render intelligible the objections I have made
to the estimates on our table
Before I letuin to Jiom, I would fiuther remai k
that the balances of appiopnationat the end of each
year, which have been so much augmented of late,
may be distributed under two distinct heads The
first embracing all such balances as may yet be re-
quned for the attainment of the objects to which
they are appropi mted The second, those balances
ascertained to be unnecessary for the purposes for
which they were originally designed, because, those
purposes have been all eady attained, oi found to be
wholly unattainable, oi to be attainable at less than
their estimated cost By a standing law, all such
balances as have stood over for two years or moi e,
from the date of their appropnation, pass to what
is called the suiplus fund, and, since the discharge
of the national debt, are mingled wnh the unappro-
priated mass of the public revenue
Without availiLg m\ self of the express admission
of the Secretary in Ins letter of the 5th Septembei
that the unexpended balances at the end of the pi es-
ent veai will not difjei much from those at the close
of the last year, ascertained to have exceeeled six
teen millions and a half, I shall not err, I trust, m
the opinion of the committee, if I set them down at
t'iat amount TheSeere*arv himself expressly states
that the appiopnations of the last year exceeded
his estimates, as they certainly did the appropria-
tions of the v ear next piecedmg, and it is obvious
that the magnitude of the balances, viliich remained
uncalled for at the end of a year, must bear propor-
tion to the number, variety, and extent of the ante-
cedent appropnations
Deducnng sixteen millions and a half fiom the
twemv-four millions of outstanding balances, com
piehended ui the Treasui v statements of the 11th
of September, and we have seven millions and a
ha'f for the full measure of the probable demands
on the Treasury for the íesidue of the year, exclu-
sive of the sums required for the Flonda war, and
the expenses of the present session of Congress
With iegaid to the new appropnation asked for
this disastrous war, a part of it will doubtless re-
main to be expended after the close of the present
year, and the remainder may be deducted from the
annual contingent fund of two millions , since war
is not only one, but the chief, of those contingencies,
for which tins fund is designed to provide, and since
three fourths of the year have, in fict, nearly ex-
íred, and to that extent limited the field of contin-
gencies during the cm rent year
The chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means ai rived at his esumate of the expenses of
