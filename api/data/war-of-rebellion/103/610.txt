re-enforcements near and will attack us again to-morrow. Send us 200 to 400 re-enforcements, if possible, by to-morrow's train.

WM. A. COCHRAN,

Captain, Commanding Post, Athens, Tenn.

A. M. ROGERS,

Captain, Commanding Post.

CHARLESTON, January 29, 1865.

Major MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Here all right. Nothing new from above. I will advance as soon as I can hear from you. Nothing is known beyond what I know from you. Shall I take the operator and instrument with me to Athens?

C. H. GROSVENOR,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

CHARLESTON, January 29, 1865.

Major S. B. MOE:

I go now with both trains flagging against train Numbers 2 from Knoxville. If I can get operator at Athens I will notify you, otherwise will send dispatches by courier. The guerrillas obstructed the track between every train near Cleveland, but did not show themselves.

C. H. GROSVENOR.

ATHENS, January 29, 1865.

Major S. B. MOE:

I am here with command. I find about 250 men already here to re-enforce. The garrison here is about 400, but not very well organized. The rebels under Graham are reported about eight miles off. I don't believe they are within fifteen miles. Unless your order different I will stay here to-night, or I will send half my own brigade to Charleston. The enemy left on the Georgia State road.

C. H. GROSVENOR,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

ATHENS, January 29, 1865 - 9 p. m.

Major S. B. MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch received.* I have sent cavalry scouts on three roads, with orders to find the enemy. Said to be strong. General Tillson urges me to proceed. I have agreed that if the enemy is in camp within fifteen miles to march rapidly to-night in time to surprise him. I do not think he is near, though Colonel Keith and others insist that he is. If I hear from them in time will report; otherwise will return in the morning.

C. H. GROSVENOR,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
