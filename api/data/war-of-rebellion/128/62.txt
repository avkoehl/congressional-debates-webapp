have been deposited in this way; thus proving, at the same time, the confidence of the country in the Government and t the plan.

It will also appear from the statements herewith that there have been issued about $846,000 of notes under $5. These notes are in great demand, and the issue of them may be extended to $10,000,000.

The issue of the large amounts and various denominations of notes has confronted us with a difficulty which calls for the intervention of Congress. It requires the services of 129 clerks to perform the various duties involved in the issue of these notes. Of these about 72 are employed in signing; and it will be readily seen that the chief security intended by the signing is thus reduced to but little practical value. It is difficult for any one to bear in mind the signatures of so many different writers; but when to this is added the changes required by sickness, absence, and resignations, it becomes impossible.

These embarrassment have been increased by the efforts of our enemies to counterfeit the notes. Organized plans seem to be in operation for introducing counterfeits among us by means of prisoners and traitors; and printed advertisements have been found, stating that the counterfeit notes, in any quantity, will be forwarded by mail from Chestnut street, in Philadelphia, to the order of any purchaser.

Under these circumstances it will be necessary to change many of the plates and to make new issues. The change would be more complete by dispensing with the variety of signatures, which are attached to the other notes. I am informed by the engravers that the signatures of the register and treasurer might be engraved in fact simile and printed, and that by stamping an elaborate engraving in colors on the back of the note the security against counterfeits would be greater than it is at present. The expense of the issue would be diminished by dispensing with the numerous signing clerks, and it more prompt execution would be secured. In order to make this change the authority of Congress is necessary. The laws against counterfeiting, it not already sufficient, must be made to embrace these notes. In this connection, too, it is proper to bring to the notice of Congress that the penalties of the law, while they apply to any person found in possession of counterfeit blank notes, with them, do not seem to embrace notes which are completely filled up and ready for circulation.

The situation of the country made it advisable to remove the printing and engraving establishments from Richmond shortly after the last adjournment of Congress. The distance from the seat of government at which so delicate a business must now be conducted involves the necessity of greater expense and of greater ability and higher character than those of ordinary clerks, in those who must superintend. I would, therefore, respectfully suggest that this Department be made a separate bureau, and that a chief clerk, with an appropriate salary, be charged with the superintendence of its business at Columbia.
