Mr Ma*ON of Ohio then oh ained the floor, tut yielded it,
for the moment, to
Mr STUART of Virginia, who said that he had i ^en fir the
purpose of iddressing o the House a few remarks in ichtionto
the unplea ant contioversy which had ausen to day, between
twoofhiac lleasucs, [ Messrs Botts and GiLMcr 3 And that
theie might be no misconception of his meaning, he had com
muted to wrmn; what he proposed to say, ajad, with ti e per
m'asion of the House, he would now read it
Mr S then read the following statement
Mr Speaker An unfortunate controversy has arisen he
tween two oi mycdleagues, winch has beena «ourceof deep
regret to me and to every member of this body I was an at
teriuve hstenei to the speeches of both gentlemen, and I am sa
ti fied that the unpleasant and peiaonal character of the con
troversy has been the result of a misconception by my friend
fiom the Richmond distuct, of the spirit and temper m which
certain phra&i s ofmv fnendfiom tie Albemarle distnctwere
conceive 1 and uttered binding m the rela ion of a colleague
and ofa friend to both these gentlemen I felt calle 1 on tointer
pise my mediation between them and I am happ} to say that
that mediation has been accepted in the spirit in which it was
0 fored My colleague^ from Albemaile used expiessionsin le
gard to the m mb r from. Richmond and his speech, which
were susceptible of an offensive interpretation, and were tin
derstood by him m that serse Butina conversation which I
have had with the member from Albemaile he distinctly dig
claimedany purpnseby those remarks to impeach the charar
ter or offend the feelings of the member from Rchmond, and I
am authorized, after a conference with both getlemen to say
so This ex lanation is entirely satisfactory to the membei
fromRichm nd, and he therefoiewnhdraws any offensive ex
pression which may have been used by him I am happy,
Mr Speak* r to give the gratify iig assurance to the House
and to the eoun ry that the painful difficulty is a( an end
Aftei some remarks by Mr MASON of Ohio,
Mr JorsE"> ofMaryland said that he did not rise to entei into
the letter, much less ihe spirit of the debate He rope to invoke
a rayofsunshme that ihey might take an observa ion and as,
certain their latitude and longitude We have, «aid Mr f got
into a stormy debate, and upon what question? It would be
difficult to find out from the debate We pas ed the Fiscal
Bank bill, upon its being presented to the President, it was
found to be m collision with his constitutional scruples and
was íeturnc I wuh his objections We then parsed the Fiscal
Ct-iporauonbill, and that fas been returned with the Prcsi
dent's objections What has the Constitution prescribed as our
duty inihetastl To inquire whether the President has the
power of vete ^ Wlethei the veto message is wut'en in a style
which corres onds with the rulesof rhetoric oi not? W he'her
he ought or not to have quo ed Latin'* Whether his motive m
the exerci e of this tfu highestand mostdelicate of his constitu
tional preio«atnes, weie pa none or conupC> Iso, «n The
Constitution «ays if the Piesident approve the Mil he shall sign
it, but if not he srntl leturn it with his objec ions to that Ht use
in which it shall hav e originated who shall enter the objections
at la °e on then journal, and proceed to reconsider it Then,
-r, we are to reconsider the bill, and that is the ques ion now
before u                                                  .,,,,.
ThePresi lent s objections ire a pioper subject of debate, that
wemayseeif there be be any thing in them to change our opi
nions of the bill Tt is is our constitutional duty But what
have we heai 1 Fieice-mil angry denunciation of the use of
the veto powtr, charges of treachery, perfidy, and motives of
personal amhi ion whichiftrue are enough damn any man's
character, and for which, if gentlemen think there is evidence to
justify their charges, they ought to exhibit against him am
clesof im| erchment If I were disposed to cavil at the veto
message I would say that the President h is gone beyond his
constitutional duty which was, to re turn the hill with his ob|ec
tionstoit, but he has gone into "abstr ictions" ipon the veto
power, and given intimations to us as to the propriety of our
adjourning The debate to day, has, I think, repaid him pnn
cipalandinteiest If these portions of his veto message are
extra constitutional, we have gone iar beyond him m denounc
mg him fot the manner m which he has discharged his consti
tuuonal duty
Sir I am no 'abstractionist," m the sense that term is used
here' 1 am a practical utilitarian But, if I have not mis
conceived the theory of ou Constitution, our Government
has three independent co ordinate departments—the Execu
uve the I e ibluive, and the sacred ermine of the Judiciary
If any one entrusted with power in any department acts cor
ruptly m the discharge of his duty, the Constitution has
provided the remedy of impeachment We are the grand in
auestof the nation—the Senate ara the high court of impeach
ment If the resident is not to be impeached, why spend
the time of the people and their money in denunciations and
comments upon ' rumor with her thousand tongues'!" I will
exercise th it charity towards the President which St Paul re-
commends, an 11 recommend to gentlemen for their calm con
tomplation the chapter of St Paul upon that subject.
The Fiesident came suddenly and unexpectedly into the Pr e
sidency    in a tew days he found Congres- assembled in extra
session    He had no time to deli lerate as he informs us, and
hasnothad during thesession, with mtenselabors pressing upon
him, and intimates that he desires until December to devise a
plan of a fiscal agent    I, for one, am willing to wait    I voted
for the two Bank bills we have passed m good faun, hoping the
best interests of our constituents would be promoted     The
President puis his objections upon the high giound of the Con
stitution,and hismoial and rehgiousobli ations Let the whole
matter go to the people   they will discuss it    The press will
will discuss it    It has occuired to me, in the midst of the in
tense excitement of the passions which we have witnessed to
day, to question whether we are m a proper mood for calm, de-
liberate consideration, and for an unpreiudicedjudgment upon
the motives of the President at the moment 01 so serious a dif
feience of opinion    I will wait till December, and then I shall
expect a plan of afiscal agency, wh ch shall incidentally give
the country "a currency of unilonn value "   This I considei
the Pi tsident bound to do, as he says m his message at the com
mencement of this session that the fiscal agent ol the Govern
ment should furnish such a currency
I sincerely hope this difference between the Executive and
Legislative departments of the Govemn entmi} be adjusted I
confess I Cc-mot see vciy clearly bow But no good can come
of angry di cu«sions and fiom listening toths whispeis of ru
m is,and obeyng the impulses ofpassicnani prejudice Ian
not yet wiil.ng to go off into ge.ieial opposition to ihe Whig Ad
ministration much less totecome involved in thatdistiactlng
q íestion of the Presidential succession With the gentleman ;
liom Ohio, [>Ir Mason 31 postpone that ques ion for some
yerrs I hope we shall leturntoa calm consideiaton of the
qu stion the Consideiation has made it our duty to decide, and
leave to the people, to time, to time ind to a calmer mood,
when oui leason shall be unclouded by jiasslon and prejudice,
the decision of the agitating questions which, 1 think, have been
improperly and impoliticly introduced into this debate

THOMPSON of Indiana

So the vo e required by the Constitution (as above stated)
not having been obtained, the bill was íejected
Some further prtceedings on other bil's were had, a report
oí which, for the sake of accuracy, as the houi was late and
the confusion great, the keporter defers till the next puhli
cation
And, at seven o'clock, the House adjourned
IN SENATE,
Saturday, September 11, 1841.
The Secretary of the Senate read a report from
the Treasury Department, m compliance with the
restlution of the 6th mst calling for information
relative to he indebtedness of the united S ates
Bank of Pennsylvania to 'he United S'ate«; which
íeport, on motion tf Mr. BENTON, was ordered
to be printed
Mr CLAYTON, from the Committee on the
L'brary, reported back to the Senate the following
joint resolution adopttd by the House, and sent to
the Senate for concurrence:
Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representa,
Uves of the Untied States of America in Congi ess assembled
That hereafter all printing by the order of the Heads of the
Execu tive Departments, or any other agent of the United States
shall, where the ratesare now higher, be done and pel formed
at the same rates established at the present session of Con-
gress by the two Houses for priming done by theu order, and
all accounts for such printing shall be settled and paid in
strict conformity to such rates by all offisers of the United
States
Mr. CLAYTON briefly explained that the ob-
ject of the resolution was to reduce the pnees_for
job printing for the Government (o the same rates,
or in the same proportion, as the prices of ordina-
ry printing for both Houses of Congress. The Li-
brary Comrr-iuee was n_t in favor of immediate
action on this resolution. It was considered by
the members of ihat commit ee that m conse-
quence of the latest *s of the session, there would
not be time to make the rececsary inquiries, and
to investigate the subject s-itisfacton y, and at the
same time lead to an cqmt ble adjustment. They
iherefore rctommended ih t the subject should be
laid over nil next ses ton
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky considered this a d< si.
rab'e retrenchment of expenditure. If an? indivi-
dual injustice was done, it could be sc'ed upon as
a special case h reaiter. He was opposed to ihe
posiponement, snd should theiefore call for the
yeas and nays.
Mr CLAYTON contended (hat there was no
necessity lo pats this reio'uiion now Congress
would meet pgam m two months, and there cauld
be no inconvenience in leav ng the printing to the
d screuon of the heads of Department , in whom
he had every confidence. He had no doubt
that any pnn'mg required between this and
ihe next session of Congress, would be doreon the
mo t reasonable lerms Tnecommiitee feared that,
if th s reso ution wps adopted, ihe Department*)
would not be able, in the recess, lo get wha ever
printing they might require done on ihe terms pre-
scribed
Mr. BUCHANAN observed ihat he had not been
attending to the resolution, and would iherefore
wish it to be read again.
The resolution was then read.
Mr. KING had no doubt that the Senator from
De'aware was correct in his views as to the
inconvenience which might arise from adopting this
resoluti n at present, as it might not be possible
to get the printing done at the satine rales paid lor
the printing of Congress. There were ttwny rea-
sons—iuch as the difference of work, difference of
quantity required &a all of wh ch would have to
be taken mío cons derautn There was an exist-
ing law w.h ch sufficently leguiated ih s woik, but
that law has been se at naught, and all for the
purpo^e of giving ih s prm mg lo lavóme indivi-
duáis, i sttad of letting the lowest bidder have i ,
a* expressly required in the law. He trusted
this course would not le pursued
Mr, CLAY of Alabama refeir d lo th  exist-
ing law, and jead frtmitihe ectitn^hich provdes
ft r tots printirg be ng given to ¡be lowest bidder.
He did nets eany necessity for a better law, if it
was acti'd upon in good faith
Mr WOODBURY explained the operation of
the law, during t o years of his ob?erv?t!0  of
it, m regard o the printing for ihe Treasury De-
partment. He had obtained a report irom the
heads of the bureaus of that Department, on
the subject, which showed that a saving of
from twenty to twenty-five per cent on the
printing bad been effect d by this law He, there-
fore, concluded ihat if this law «as adheredno
and carried out by ihe D partment in good faith,
as much saving would be the result as the nature
of the case would admit of
Mr. CLAY ot Kentuckj was not awre of that
law. It seemed sufficient to meet the case. He
supposed ii had been overlooked, which would ac-
count for the resolution. He would wi'hdraw his
call for the yeas and nays, and also his opposition
to the motion to lay the resolattcn on tbe table
The motion to postpone the consideration of the
reioluiion indefinitely, was then oairied without a
division
Mr   WRIGHT cal ed  up the joint resolution
from the House, fixing Monday at 11 o'clock for
the time of the adjournment of Congiess.
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky would oppose no obsta-
