power " to raise a revenue for distribution," either
««directlyor indirectly," is unqualifiedly correct,
and, as it is admitted, I shall attempt to show-
that the object and effect of the measure proposed
would violate that principle, and divert the pro-
ceeds of the sales of the public lands from the
expressed objects and intentions of the several
deeds of eession, made by the States of Vir-
ginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and New York,
to the General Government, which expressly de-
clare, among other things,
" That all the lands witMn the territory as ceded to the
United States, and not reserved or appropriated to any of
the beforementioned purposes, or disposed of in bounties
to the officers and soldiers of the American Army, shall be
considered as a common fund for the use and1 benefit of
such of the united States as have become or shall become
membefs of the Confederation or Federal alliance of the
said States, Virginia inclusive, according to their usual re
¿speotive- proportions in the general charge and expenditure,
and shall be faithfully and bona fide disposed of for that
purpose, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever "
To arrive at the true meaning of the deeds of
cession, we must look to the dates of those instru-
ments, and the objects to be effected by them, and
by examining these all important points, we find
that the deeds of cession made in the year 1783,
by Virginia, after the close of the revolutionary
war, and during the existence of the Government
under the Articles of Confederation, when the
States were sovereign and independent, in the ex-
ercise of all the rights of sovereignty, and could
make a treaty stipulation with the othei sovereign
Stales or with the Congress, which then exercised
limited power under the then form of Govern-
ment, which at once set the whole argument of
the gentleman from Virginia in favor of distribu-
tion at defiance, and render it nugatory
After the close of the war, we find Virginia,
as welt as the other States, largely indebted to her
soldiery and citizens for services, provisions, and
munitions of war, advanced to carry on the strug
gle for independence, and all dispossessed of the
ability to liquidate their just debts Hence, it was
n matter of policy in that State to change that
liability to some other quarter, and they made a
deed of cession to relieve themselves fiom the lia-
bility thus referíed to The State of Virginia had
a, claim to the wild landsacquired by her charters
under her colonial government, to what was
termed the Noithwest Terutoiy, which now in-
cludes the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Mich-
igan, and the Territories of Wisconsin and Iowa
The nature of that claim, situated as it was, and
being in possession of bands and hordes of hos-
tile Indians, it is not mypuipose to examine,
but, if I should do so, I do very much doubt if I
should not be able to show that, in tiansfemng it
to the Federal Government, Virginia displayed
quite as much policy and interest and sagacity as
magnanimity, or a benevolent devotion to the hap-
piness of a young Republic just merging into ex-
istence, nntl, besides, if an argument wcie now
opened on the subject, and its discussion were
now in order, it is not at all improbable that it
might be proved that Virginia never had a legiti-
mate claim, by conquest, purchase, or by any
other of the lights of possession, to a single acre
of the domain she so generously and nobly ceded
to the Federal Government
But, all this aside, Virginia, through her legis-
lative bodies, made a cession of her northwestei n
territorial claim to the General Government, and
that Government agieed to satisfy and liquidate
all her military bounties, with an understanding
that the surplus, if any, should be applied as a
common fund for the benefit of all the States,
(Virginia included,) according to the stipulation
in the deed of cession before alluded to, and for
no other purpose. The obvious intention of this
stipulation was, that the surplus should then be
applied in liquidating the expenses of those States
which were sovereign, and as such had partici
pated in the expenses and sufferings and glories
of the war for independence At that period the
several States were supported by adirecttaxupon
their citizens, and it was to afford them remuner-
ation for their losses that this arrangement was
effected The compact thus made mutually be-
tween the State of Virginia and the Federal Gov-
ernment, led to the creation of the fund of which
I have just spoken, and ltthus virtually became
a State fund for the support of the Government,
and precisely as much so as it has, since the
adoption of the Federal Constitution, become a
common fund for the General Government, the
mode of taxation having been changed by the
formation of the Constitution, and consequently
it has ever been considered a portion of the rev-
enue to be expended for the benefit of all the
States and the nation, and, until this project of
distribution was started in 1832, no man, I believe,
ever supposed or contended that this fund was to
be diverted from the usual application It must
be borne in mind that the funds derived from sales
of the public lands were to be applied to extinguish
the national debt, which at that time (1783, at
the close of the war) was not less than eighty
million dollars, and, by reference to the return
from the Commissioner of the General LandOffice,
it will be seen that the whole amount of sales does
not exceed one hundred and six million dollars,
exclusive of some twenty eight million dollars
expense accrued in bringing this land into mar
ket, so that the net proceeds of sales has about
extinguished, without interest, the national debt,
leaving the cost of extinguishing Indian titles to
the public domain, and the purchase of Louisiana
and Florida, unprovided for, amounting, in all,
to about sixty million dolíais, as will be seen
from the table

The national debt, it is true, has been paid, but
it was liquidated by appropriating to its extin
guishment a portion of the money arising from
customs There was, however, another* debt,
created by extinguishing Indian titles, to the
amount of $60,000,000, which is also to be paid
before you can apply the funds fiom the public
lands for any other purpose, even if there were
not a constitutional objection It is admitted that
we cannot raise money for distribution by direct
taxation, or by revenue from imports This I
admit and assume, then we have taken money
out of the public Treasury to extinguish the In-
dian titles to all the lands we claim under the
deeds of cession and treaty, and until that money
is refunded, by the application of the sales of the
public domain, it is a part of the national revenue,
and cannot be distributed '
This fact, this position, I presume, cannot be
denied, and will not be controverted, and with
these undisputed evidences before me, I feel my-
self authorized in saying that the question of dis-
tribution is settled and cannot be sustained by
argument or sophistry, for you cannot do indi-
rectly what you cannot do directly, and that the
positions here assumed were so understood, I
shall cite to the House an ordinance as early as
May, 1785, providing for sales of land in the
Western Territory, and directing the proceeds to
be paid into the Treasury of the United States,
&c. As early as the 4ih of August, 1790, Con-
gress enacted as follows
" That the proceeds of the sales which shall be made of
lands in the Western 1 crnlory, now belonging, or that may
hereafter belong, to the United States, shall be, and are
hereby, appropriated towards sinking or discharging the
debt  lor the paymi nt whereof the United btates are now,
or by virtue oí this act may be, holden , and shall be applied
solely to tint use until the debt shall be fully satisfied "
And that this was the settled policy of the Gov-
ernment none will deny, until the celebrated pro-
ject of Mr  Clay in 18J2.
You cannot, Mi Spaaker, raise money foi dis-
tribution nor can you take money out of the
Treasury to pay for lands, and sell them, and
distubute the avails of their sale to the States, or
make any other disposition of them, no more
than you can touch the money in the Treasury
without special appropriation made by authority
of law In this place,and at this point, it becomes
me to notice another position assumed, but not
successfully maintained, by the gentleman from
Vngnua, [Mi Robertson,] whose ingenuity in
arguing and advocating abstractions, has long
since won forlnman honorable distinction Sir,
that honorable gentleman says there is no diffei-
ence between the lands acquired by cession and
those acquued by pinchase In the main, that
assumption may be true, there is, however, a
distinction which will serve to demonstrate the
moie clcaily the giound that I maintain, that is
to say, I contend that the lands acquued by treaty
with Fiance and Spain, are without the limita-
tions and restrictions which, in other cases, might
requue that the proceeds of sales shall be dis-
posed of for the " common benefit of all, and for
no other purposes " We are left free to dispose
of them as justice and a strict adherence to the
pnnciples of the Constitution may authorize,
but Congress has acquired no more power to dis-
tubute the proceeds of the sales of those lands
than it has over the ceded lands, for the assump-
tion of any such power would amount toan open
and dnect violation of the admitted proposition,
that money cannot be raised for distribution
I Sir, I need not say that $29,000,000, including
I interest, were taken out of the Treasury to carry
l into execution the Louisiana treaty of 1803, and
the Florida treaty of 1818, besides this, we have
! paid not less than $60,000,000 for the extinguish-
ment of Indian titles, the sum total amounting to
nearly $90,000,000, independently of the national
debt, bung,m fact, and in the eyes of the law, so
much money in the public Treasury which cannot
be vested in lands, stocks, or anything else to
change its character, so as to enable it to avoid
the constitutional objection
To tell me that you can take the public money
to purchase a territory, extinguish Indian titles,
and then divide the proceeds of the lands thus ac-
quired, when it is admitted that the money in the
first instance could not be so applied, is to ask me
to swallow and adopt abstractions and plunge at
once in the latitudinanao-construction of the Con
stitution m a word, it is to ask me to adopt opin-
ions and dogmas variant and at war with my own
sentiments, and in violation of all the principles
and political creeds of the party with which I have
the honor to associate Sir, you had as well tell
me that you can take the public money for the
purchase of a ship, and dispatch her to Europe at
the public expense, and there, out of the funds of
