a regtrd to the rights of others On neither ot these as
motives, on the part of his Most Christian Majesty, to a
tur adjustment ot this most tiuitful source ol misunder
standing between the two countries, has the President ever
enterttinul adiubt "
In 1835 there agtin occurred the same difficulty.
The Fiench King understood the President's
message to Con -icss in 1834 to charge his Gov-
ernment with bad faith, and as placing this Gov-
ernmen' in t menacing attitude towaids that of
ritnct The President admitted, without re-
serve, that, in his messtge of 1834, he did not
intend to charge the French Government with
bid faith, or to make any thieat, or to convey any
affiont whatever, but that he would not explain
this misunderstanding to France.
In the progress of the negotiation between the
two nations the controversy was at last narrowed
down to the mere misunderstanding as to a pas-
sage in the message of 1834, and upon this point
it was decided to devote this nation to the hazaids
of war, rather than say to the French Govern-
ment it had placed a meaning on the message
winch the President admitted he did not intend
to give it
The following are the positions taken in 1835
by this Government-
1st That a foreign Government, in its inter-
course with our own, has no right to take any
notice whatever of any communication made by
tlir President to Congress in the discharge of his
official duties, and, consequently, no right to de-
mand an explanation of the purport of any such
message, whatever imputations it may contain,
and however offensive and imperious its terms
may seem
2d. That to give or offer such explanations
would be to admit the right to claim them, and
tint such an admission, by subjecting the Ex-
ecutive, in the discharge of a constitutional duty,
to the interference and control of a foreign Power,
would be inconsistent with the character and
dignity of our Gov ernment, and a virtual sacrifice
of the national honor and independence
The principle that a foreign nation should not
be permitted to inquire into the meaning of a
message of the President to Congress, was held
to be so vital, so connected with our national
independence, that it was said in debate here by
one in confidence, [Mi Cambreleng,] that, if
the nation was flowing in blood from Maine to
Orleans, the misunderstanding with France would
not be explained
The misunderstanding of 1830 and 1835 oc-
curring between the same nations upon a point
in all respects precisely similar, was, in the first
case freely explained, and in the last, wai was
deemed pieferable to explanation Whether the
Administiation was right in 1830 or 1835, 1 will
not undertake here to decide, but every candid
man must see that if the same course had been
pursued in the last ínsttiice that there was in the
first, there would have been no occasion to break
the ancient fuendship between America and
France with any talk of wai Whether the case
of 1830 or that of 1835 will be regarded in Europe
or America as containing the principle of this
Administration in regard to the subject, no one
can tell, as the two cases were alike and the de-
cisions opposite
In 1830 a French treaty was very much desired,
and it was very popular, and was made to cut a
great figure in the elections of that time In 1835
there was a large suiplus in the Tieasury, and
the money and the apparent necessity foi fleets
and armies were well calculated to induce the
nation to consent to such an increase of expend-
itures as would place the surplus under the con
trol of the Federal Government, and defeat the
division of any portion of it among the States
Sir, I will now return from this foreign digres-
sion to oui domestic concerns again
The present dominant party owes its elevation
to power more to the piomise to íetrench the e\
penses of the Government than to any other cause
This string was struck oftener in the canvass from
1825 to 1829 than any other " The party," be-
foie they came into power, and when they were
seeking votes, told the people of this country that
the expenditures of the Federal Government were
prodigally, dangerously, wastefully extravagant,
and that, if they were invested with power they
would speedily introduce such a system of reform
and retrenchment as would bring back the Gov-
ernment to the JefFersonian economy The peo-
ple believed the representations, and put their
faith in these solemn pledges of reform, which
were a thousand times repeated
"The party" being snugly seated rn power,
these pledges were soon forgotten We have
seen seven yeais glide away, and the first effective
movement for retrenchment has not yet been
made In place of retrenchment, we have, during
these seven years, seen annual millions added to
the wide spread extravagance of the public ex-
penses. Sir, in my remarks, I intend to rely upon
no facts except those that are established by doc
uments that none can question What I am about
to state in regard to the publrc expenses is taken
from a report made to this House by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, Mr. Woodbury, on the 4th
day of January, 1836, and which I now hold in
my hand This report shriws tbe annual ex-
penses of the Government from the years 1816
to 1834, inclusive, this, together with the estimates
in the last annual report of the same Secretary for
the years 1835 and 1836, shows the expenses of
this Administration, piovided the appropriation
bills conform to the estimates The following
tabular statement, extracted from said report,
shows the annual and total expenditures for the
eight years of this Administration, from 1829 to
1836, inclusive, contrasted with the annual and
total expenditures of the preceding eight years,
fiom 1821 to 1828, inclusive, including the four
last years of Mr Momoe's administration, and
the four years of Mr Adams's, showing also the
amount paid annually of the public debt during
both terms

ments from 1829 to 1836
But the people have been told that the reason
why the expenses of the Government wete so
much nicieased of late was because the piesent
Administration had paid off so much of the pub-
lic debt more than had been previously paid in
the same space of time So far from this being
true, thp foregoing table shows that there had
been ptid in the eight preceding years the sum
of $18,754,424 19 moie than during this Admin-
istration; yet we have seen public festivals and
rejoicings upon the point of the transcendent
merit of having paid the public debt
In regard to the payment of the public debt,
no President since the year 1817 deserves either
praise or censure more than the man m the moon
Those who passed the law of 1817, for the re-
demption of the public debt, and the people of
the United States, whose industry and enterpri-e
filled the public Treasury, deserve all the credit
for the payment of the debt.
Although it is not in place, I will here present
a view that will show that the proceeds of the
sales of the public lands should be taken from
the control of this Government Under our
revenue system, the money power is almost irre-
sponsible The price of the public lands not
being paid by the people in the foim of a tax,
their attention is not sufficiently directed to the
subjeet to hold then Representativesaccounttble
how they use it This Administration presents
a signal instance of the truth of what 1 say; they
are held to no responsibility for substituting; an
increase of the public expenditures of over forty-
five million dolíais, in place of retrenchment,
while they are dividing the public treasure as
spoils among favorites In the tnumphs of
present impunity, they can securely laugh at the
simplicity of all those who believed that there
was anything1 gehous in their promises of re-
trenchment and reform.
This signal instante Of escape fnym public cen-
suie proves that our redundant income is paid
under such circumstances that it can be squan-
dered by a successful party in contempt of all the
maxims of economy By dividing the public
treasure among a sufficient number of.partisans,
exemption from responsibility can be secured
The only cure for this evil, the only way to re-
store accountability, is to take the control of the
proceeds of the sales of the public kinds olxi of
the hands of this central power, and give them to
the States
The principles of this Administration are not
to be found in retrenchment, in the economical
management of the public finances So far, pro-
fessions and practices have run in directions ex-
actly opposite
I will now refer to two other documents which
do contain the principles, with a view to which
this Administiation has been conducted, and by
the aid of which it has attained its dnns^rous
ascendency These principles were imported from
one of the States, Where they had been tested,
and, since their adoption as the basis of Federal
action, have already wrought a revolution rn the
theory and practice of our Government
We are informed by the President, tn bis veto
of the land bill, that " money is power I" and we
I are informed by him, in his protest, that " the
whole executive power being Vested1 mi the Pres
ident, who is responsible for its exercise, it is a
necessary consequence that he should have the
right to employ agents of his own choice."
Again he says in the same paper, speaking
of the Secretary of the Treasury, " that lie was
an executive officer, the mere instrument of the
Chief Magistrate in the execution of the laws "
From these explicit declarations, that " money
is power," and that the executive officers of this
nation are the mere instruments of the President,
the principles are revealed which have been the
btsis of thit extraordimuy ascendency to which
all the checks of the Constitution have opposed
so feeble a resistance
By the original theory and piactice under our
Constitution, the public officers were held to be
