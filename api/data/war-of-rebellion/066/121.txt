There are no movements which I am prepared to recommended at present. At present I am scouting to find out where the enemy is, a kind of information of which I received none from General Gordon, except that a rebel force had been sent down by rail. Within a week I hope to be able to have more definite ideas on this point.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,Jacksonville, June 8, 1864.

Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The country lying between Trout Creek on the south and Thomas' Swamp and Creek, Nassau River, and the Saint John's on the north, east, and southeast, has been scouted under my orders by a detachment from the Eighth U. S. Colored Troops. All that part of Nassau County is free from rebels. I have not yet received the detailed report. A second party is to-day scouring the neck of land lying this side of Doctor's Lake and between McGirt's Creek and the Saint John's. They are in search of a torpedo party said to have landed there.

Your obedient servant,

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,June 8, 1864.

Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: It is important that there should be prompt and constant communication between this point and Saint Augustine and Picolata. The usual means employed in the army is the telegraph. It will require about 60 miles of telegraphic wire. I respectfully request that Captain Sheldon, or, in his absence, some one acquainted with the business, be ordered to report to me with the necessary materials for building the same. About 10 miles extra wire and some tap batteries should be added. This telegraph line I consider essential to the prompt concentration of the troops in Florida.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
