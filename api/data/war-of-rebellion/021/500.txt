HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, New Orleans, June 27, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War:

SIR: Inclosed will be found several letters addressed to General David E. Twiggs, late of the U. S. Army, by his son-in-law, Colonel Myers, late of the Army, and now Quartermaster-General, I believe, of the Confederate States Government.

The latter of November 12, 1860, which incloses the order for General Twiggs to take command in Texas, shows that at that early day he was contemplating the treason he has since acted, and that he sought the very place so as to be in position to do the utmost mischief.

The others, of dates My 16, 22, and 26,* disclose the reason of his appointment as provisional general by the rebel government and his declination of the position of major-general.

All these were found in his house, which I have taken possession of, and, with its furniture, have had put in order for quarters for myself and a portion of my staff.

I have caused all the property here which General Twiggs owned or of which he received the income to be sequestered, and the rents, after paying expenses, to be hold to await the action of the Government of the United States.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BULTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
