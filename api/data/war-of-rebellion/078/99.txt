LEXINGTON, June 11, 1864.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

Rebels retreated yesterday to Georgetown; marched from there toward Frankfort a short distance; returned through Georgetown toward Paris. General Burbridge moved out to fight them at midnight with most of his own force and Garrard's. I think Hobson is on their track, as he telegraphed yesterday he should try to reach here last night.

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 11, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

Dispatches from Cincinnati, by way of Louisville, represent General Hobson as being in a tight place. One this afternoon said it was thought he was surrounded, another just received says he has been worsted in a fight. It does not seem to be very reliable, coming as it does from a courier. Have you anything definite in regard to him and his command? Where is he and what force has he to contend with? Can you give us the strength of the enemy in the State, and where their main force is? We are confounded with conflicting rumors, and are kept in a constant state of suspense and anxiety. Please give us all the news you have in regard to Hobson and Burbridge. Your dispatch of this evening led us to the belief that Hobson was all right. Anything from him since that?

SPEED S. FRY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, KY., June 11, 1864--9 p. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

In addition to the report of Hobson's fight, sent by operator, Laird, his quartermaster, telegraphs from Falmouth that he was cut off from the general in the fight this morning. I feel confident Hobson had a severe battle quite early to-day between Falmouth and Cynthiana, and got worsted. I have sent a courier to General Burbridge with the news. I think Morgan's main force, say 1,500, left Georgetown last evening, and went to and beyond Cynthiana. General Burbridge left here at 12 last night for Paris, and I hope ere this has again whipped Morgan. I have not heard direct from General Burbridge yet.

LEXINGTON, KY., June 11, 1864--10. 30 p. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

Courier just in from General Burbridge at Paris. He thinks that every person at Camp Nelson capable of assisting in its defense should be armed. Does not tell me on what information this order is based. All quiet here now. Please acknowledge.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
