Question. When you came here you found her here?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Albatross?

Answer. I cannot swear to that. I have read that; that is all I know aabout it.

sailed?

The WITNESS. The log was on board.

Mr. ASHTON. What log?

The WITTNESS. The log - book that was originally on the Enchantress.

Mr. WHARTON. Certainly.

Mr. ASHTON. We rest here for the present.
