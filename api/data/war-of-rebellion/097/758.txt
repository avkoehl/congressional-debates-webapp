A dispatch yesterday received from Major-General Gibbon stated that, owing to the large amount of property found at Lynchburg and the condition of the roads, it would require at least a week before it could be all removed. To-day we have a very heavy rain-storm which will protract this operation and render the transmission of supplies to Farmville very difficult.
