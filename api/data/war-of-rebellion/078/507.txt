DECATUR, September 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Scout from Athens reports 300 rebels within three miles of Athens. I am repairing the road to that point, and will reoccupy the place as soon as I have a disposable force. Effective force at my command: Eighteenth Michigan Infantry, 333; One hundred and second Ohio, 250; Seventy-THIRD Indiana, 411; Thirteenth Wisconsin, 461; Tenth Indiana, 427; Eleventh Indiana, 700; total infantry, 2,582. One hundred of One hundred and second Ohio and 100 Eleventh Indiana at Stevenson. By order of General Rousseau, 250 men on gun-boats. Infantry force much diminished by sickness since my last report, particularly my best regiments, recently on river and garrisons of block-houses on margins of streams. Infantry garrisons, Decatur, Huntsville, and twenty-five block-houses and stations on railroad to Stevenson. The abandonment of any would insure the burning of bridge in twenty-four hours by Johnson or Mead. We have also a post on the river occupied by 200 men. We have on the south to look after, at Larkinsville (Clanton), 750 men, and a regiment, 400 strong, back of Guntersville. Wheeler now near same point, 3,500 strong. My estimate much below everybody else. Patterson's old command, 600, near this post, other side. Johnson and Mead, 250, and scattering force of Forrest. I have not the least apprehension but I can hold any position taken, but our difficulty is to know where to hold, when we have only infantry to hold so large a body of cavalry. Our infantry are not only eager, but mad, because they cannot get a fight. Our cavalry force: Second Tennessee, 300; Twelfth Indiana, 170; total, 470. Nothing heard from Forrest since 4 o'clock day before yesterday.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, September 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have sent 300 men to reoccupy Athens. I have left 300 cavalry and 500 infantry; this will leave minimum garrisons at stations and block-houses. General Rousseau has all my available force at upper end of the road. This will not leave a single mounted man at Decatur. For further particulars, I respectfully call your attention to detailed report to-day.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILLE, September 28, 1864-6 a. m.

Lieutenant SAMUEL M. KNEELAND,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Decatur:

Have just received dispatch from the lieutenant at Whitesburg, dated 4. 30 a. m. The enemy were crossing the river, in canoes, rafts, and boats, about a mile below him; he did not know how many. A gun-boat arrived there just as courier was coming away. The lieutenant has sent his force down to attack them; expect to have full particulars soon, and will inform you more particularly.

WM. P. LYON,

Colonel, Commanding.
