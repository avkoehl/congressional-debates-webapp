HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,Todd's Tavern, May 5, 1864 - 7 p. m.

GENERAL: After skirmishing heavily with the enemy's cavalry at and beyond Craig's Church, I have just arrived with my command at this place, with the exception of the Fifth New York Cavalry Regiment, that was left at Parker's Store on picket this morning, and the Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Lieutenant-Colonel Brinton, which regiment, covering my rear on falling back from Craig's Church, was prevented from reaching Catharpin road before a heavy column of cavalry had taken possession of the point of interception. Brigadier-General Gregg, who is here with his division, has just started to extricate them. Since writing the above part of the Eighteenth Pennsylvania has come in, and the balance are reported coming in on the flank.

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.

Have run the enemy's cavalry a mile from Spotsylvania Court-House; have charged them through the village. Am fighting now with a considerable force, supposed to be Lee's division. Everything all right.

Your note of 30th May, 10.30 p. m., is just received. You speak of the two objects of my remaining in this position, to cover the right of the army, and destroy the railroad and bridges. I have been relieved from the duty of destroying railroads by an order from General Sheridan, and am confining myself exclusively to covering the right.
