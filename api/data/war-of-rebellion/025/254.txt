CORINTH, October 2, 1862.

General GRANT:

My troops are all concentrated in nearly the position given last night. Have ordered Colonel Lee to examine best point for crossing the Hatchie. What do you think of the plan of my moving with my entire command, save perhaps six regiments, and crossing Hatchie, say near Ruckersville or higher up, as report may show, and push those fellows to the wall?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, Miss., October 2, 1862.

Brigadier-General HAMILTON,

Commanding Division:

The general commanding directs that you prepare your command to move by 3 o'clock with three days' rations. Move into the outskirts of town to the north by upper bridge road. Bivouac your troops, columns closed in mass. Your artillery will accompany you. Take post on Purdy road north of the town.

Brigadier-General STANLEY,

Commanding Division:

The general commanding directs that you occupy Kossuth with sufficient force yourself, and relieve Colonel Moore, of Twenty-first Missouri.

Let us know when you will be ready.

Very respectfully,

[H. G. KENNETT,]

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, October 2, 1862.

Brigadier-General STANLEY,

Commanding Division:

The meaning of my communication was that you send sufficient force to occupy Kossuth and not proceed there in person; that is to say, Kossuth will be an outpost of your own division and under your own supervision, and will report to you, and you will report what you deem of importance to these headquarters.

Find out by all possible means the best modes of marching our division across the Hatchie.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[H. G. KENNETT,]

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
