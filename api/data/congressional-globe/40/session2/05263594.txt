THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 29,
on and after its completion to be and remain free
from all tolls and tribute, except so much as shall
be necessary to operate the same and keep it in re-
pair, and that all moneys in the hands of the treas-
urer of the canal companj, when transferred, shall
be paid into the Treasury of the United States.
Mr. SPALDING. I move to strike out that
section. It ought to be stricken out.
Mr. GROVEU. Mr. Speaker, the section
of the bill under consideration appropriates
$450,000 toward the completion of the Louis-
ville and Portland canal; and provides for the
assumption of the payment by the Government
of the bonds issued for the completion of said
canal, amounting to the sum of $1,507,000,
and a cession on the part of the corporation
and the State of Kentucky of said canal and
its appurtenances to the United States.
The question is, Should Congress make tlie
appropriation on the terms proposed? Should
Congress make the appropriation and a farther
appropriation hereafter of $4-30,000, the esti-
mated cost of completing the enlargement of
the canal, the Government will become the
owner in its own right, of the entire work.
The Louisville and Portland canal was com-
pleted in December, 1830, by a company char-
tered by the State of Kentucky. The Govern-
ment was a stockholder to the amount of two
thousand three hundred and thirty-five shares,
costing S-3o,500.
In 1881 the Government received five hun-
dred and sixty-seven shares more in lieu of
dividends. Between ISO 1 and 1842 it received
$257,778in cash from the dividends declared by
the company ; so that atthe end of twelve years
the Government received $24,278 in cash, and
live hundred and sixty-seven shares in stock
more than it invested in the canal, and was
still owner of two thousand nine hundred and
two shares in the canal, valued at $230,200;
thus receiving $547,978 for its original invest-
ment in the canal.
From 1842 up to date no dividends have
been declared, the net income of the canal up
to 1859 being devoted to the purchase of stock
owned by private individuals, (said stock being
held in trust by the board of directors;) and
since 1859 to the enlargement and extension
of the eanal and to create a sinking fund for
paying the bonds which were issued by the
company to defray the expenses of said work.
In 1800 this enlargement and extension were
began ou plans submitted by Mr. T. It. Scow-
den, a civil engineer of experience and repu-
tation, and stopped in 1866 for want of funds,
after $1,825,403 23 had been expended for
lands and work on* the improvement, thus
malting the cost of the eanal, as it stands,
$2,825,403 23.
Bat in case the Government assumes the
payment of the bonded indebtedness of the
company it will be upon the following assump-
tions of payment. The bonded indebtedness
of the company is as follows:
370 bonds due in 1871    $370,000
309 bonds due in 1876  390,000
39S bonds due in 1881   398,000
400 bonds due in 1886  400,000
$1,567,000
The five shares of stock are $100 dollars
each. There is on hand, to the credit of the
sinking fund, a balance of $217,453 70; so
that no part of the debt of the company so
assumed will fall due before 1871, at which
time the bonds, amounting to the sum of
$370,000, fall due; $399,000 fall due in 1876;
$398,000 in 1S81; and $400,000 in 188C. But,
by the terms of the third section of the bill
under consideration, when the proposed trans-
fer shall be made all moneys in the hands of
the treasurer of the canal company shall be
paid into the Treasury of the United States,
which amount on the Kith December, 1867,
equaled the sum of $217,453 70 ; and there is
no reason to believe that amount has been
diminished, or will be, but rather increased
during the current years. Accurate tests for
a,period of more than twenty years establish
the fact that navigation over the falls of the
Ohio is interrupted by that natural obstruction
nine months and nine days in the year, leaving
but two months and twenty-one days during
the entire year when the falls of the Ohio can
be passed by unobstructed navigation.
Let it be remembered that the Ohio river and
its tributaries drain the whole of parts of ten
States of the Union, the great granary of the
country, the Egypt of the nation, and is one of
the most importantin a system, giving eighteen
thousand miles of navigable water.
The tabular statement annexed, derived ftom
sources believed to be entirely authentic, and
mainly from the census of 1860, presents in a
condensed form the extent of navigable waters,
number of population, and amount of trans-
portation of the fourteen States lying on the
banks of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers:
"The States lying on the banks of the Ohio and Mis-
sissippi livers, tourtoen in number, had, by the census
of 1800, a population uf 16,9u9,494, or more than half
the whole population of the Unired States; arid these
two rivers have a coast line ot 36,098 miles, while the
coast of the Atlantic is 2,163 miles, and the Gulf ot
Mexico 1,761 miles, and ot tho Pacific 1,313 miles, on
a hue ot 21,354 miles, including bays and indenta-
tions.
" These rii ers drain an area of 1,785,267 square miles,
more than half of the whole 3,001,002 square rniies in
the United States; and thcaetourteen states,in 1860,
contained 9-1,402,86!) ot the 163.110,720improved acres,
and 126,703,393 of the 211,101,818 unimproved acres of
the whoie United States; and the valuation ot prop-
erty in these fourteen States shows $8,467,511,274 of
the whole valuation of tho United Suitesâ€”$16,077,-
358,715: showing very conclusively that these tour-
teen States pay more than halt the taxes, work more
than half ot the improved land, have the majority of
the population, and also the majority ot the land to
develop, of the whole United States.
"By the census of 1860, the whole product of the
United States was valued at $1,900,000,000, while the
foreign exports ot the domestic produce were only
$373,189,274, or less than one litth of the whole prod-
uct, leaving lour filths for exchange in domestic com-
merce bet veen the States.
" The proportion of the whole product afforded by
these fourteen States we speak for may be judged by
the returns of their produce, gathered from the cen-
sus of 1860, and compared with the whole United
States, as lollows;

It will be perceived that the foregoing state-
ment does not include the salt, the iron and
other ores, the timber and lumber which
annually float upon the bosoms of these mighty
rivers, and the tonnage of which is, perhaps,
greater than that of all other articles of trans-
portation combined.
The total tonnage owned in the United
States is returned in the census of I860 at
5,353,808 tons, and the portion belonging to
the fourteen States at 996,266 tons ; but it is
estimated by competent parties that the trans-
portation on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
for the year 1866 equaled 7,905,216 tons, evinc-
ing the activity in domestic commerce of these
river States, which commerce is yet in its
infancy, as daily developments do most cer-
tainly show, and demonstrating that from these
States has and must come the most of the food
supply of the whole nation, and for export
including the supply of the gold and silver
States now so largely and rapidly developing
upon the tributaries of these waters.
By reference to the report on the Louisville
and Portland canal, Fortieth Congress, second
session, the following summary appears:
" It [the Louisville and Portland canal] is a work
designed to obviate the principal obstruction in the
navigation of tbe Ohio river, upon tho construction
and management of which has been expended, in
the various forms of outlay, an aggre^a te of $6,500,000,
two thirds ofwhiehsum ha vebeen derived from atax
on the commerce of the West, collected in the form
of tolls; and yet for the completion of which Con-
gress is now called upon for $1,000,000; a work that
has been before one or both branches of tho national
Legislature, in some form or other, nearly every ses-
sion for more than forty years, and yet with reference
to which so little appears to be known to-day by
intelligent members that legislation, without the
special communication of information, would move
almost wholly in tho dark."
The same report shows that the present rate
of hauling freight from the Portland wharf to
the Louisville wharf, and vice versa, is one
dollar per ton. Present rate of passing freight
by the Louisville and Portland canal fifty
cents per ton ; and the supposed rate ol pass-
iug freight by the canal after its completion
and free use except as to the collection of tolls
enough to operate it and keep it in good repair,
ten cents per ton.
It is the matured judgment of those whoare
believed to know that the amount of freight
transported on the Ohio river in the year 18G7,
including rafts of timber and lumber, equaled
3,733,420 tons; that the average distance to
which said freight was carried was five hun-
dred and sixty-seven miles ; to transport which
would require thirty-five railroads three hun-
dred miles long, running four heavily-laden
trains each day.
It is suggested that the enlargement of the
canal upon the basis proposed would reduce
the price of freight at least ten cents per hun-
dred pounds upon the Ohio and her tributa-
ries, thereby saving to the people of the Uni-
ted States in one year from freights alone a sum
much greater than the cost of completing the
entire work of the enlargement of the canal
and liquidating the existing debt. Louisville,
that great commercial center which I have the
honor to represent upon this floor, located, as
it is, at the head of this great natural barrier to
the navigation of the Ohio, will gain nothing
of advantage, but perhaps be loser financially
by the proposed enlargement of the canal and
transfer of its franchises to the Government of
the United States. Bat, rising above selfish
considerations, Louisville does not object;
while the great State whose commercial center
she is, the whole of the great West and North-
west, as well as the best interests of the entire
Union, imperatively demand the adoption of
the third section of the bill now before the
House for consideration.
During his remarks Mr. Gkoveu moved pro
forma to increase the appropriation $50,000,
for the purpose of concluding his speech.
