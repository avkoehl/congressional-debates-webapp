small force on that frontier would not only expose those counties to the enemy, but greatly discourage the people, and deter them from exerting themselves to the utmost to produce abundant crops.

I have heard, but not from any official source, that Brigadier-General Marshall has been relieved from his command. If this is so, and no other general officer now with the troops assigned to the command, I respectfully suggest that Brigadier-General Williams be directed to assume the command, temporarily at least, until a permanent commander is designated and takes the command. Williams is now at Saltvile, and entirely available for that service.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, May 2, 1863.

Colonel [J. M.] CORNS,Commanding Eighth Virginia Cavalry, Central Depot:

The enemy's cavalry attacked Edgar at Lewisburg very early this morning. They may with to penetrate to New River Bridge. Be on the alert; double the guard; post pickets on the roads leading to the bridge, and be in every way prepared to receive the enemy should he come.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,Via Narrows:

Derrick's battalion is ordered to move forward* toward Lewisburg immediately. Move the Forty-fifth [Virginia] also to Edgar's support. It may be that the enemy proposes to push on through to the railroad. Communicate with McCausland. He will be directed to co-operate with you. In that case you, of course, command the whole. Send me information promptly. I trust the information you send by Major McLaughlin is latter than that from Captain [R. H.] Catlett.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Colonel JOHN McCAUSLAND,Via Narrows:

Send the four companies and a field officer immediately to the Narrows as a guard, if you have not already sent them. Select Major [George W.] Hammond as the field officer, if you have not already selected one.
