HDQRS. THIRD BRIG., FIRST DIV., 14TH ARMY CORPS,Chattanooga, October 13, 1863.

[Captain T. C. WILLIAMS, Actg. Asst. Adjt. Genn.:]

SIR: During the absence of Brigadier-General Starkweather, and Colonel Hambright being unwell and unable to attend to the duties as commanding officer of this brigade, I hereby assume command of the Third Brigade, First Division, Fourteenth Army Corps.

Respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

WILLIAM SIRWELL,

Colonel Seventy-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers.
HDQRS. EIGHTEENTH KENTUCKY VOLUNTEER INFANTRY,Camp near Williams' Island, October 13, 1863.

Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report the Haley trace road cleared of dead animals and broken wagons. The enemy in considerable force yet occupy the opposite bank of the river. The force under command of Major Shane, Ninety-eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, failed to dislodge them, the artillery (Napoleon guns) having proved ineffective, not do I think guns of longer range could be used with much advantage. Work upon the road is suspended, as for nearly 4 miles the men are exposed to the fire of sharpshooters. Trains passed over the new route up the mountain yesterday.

I am, very respectfully,

HUBBARD K. MILWARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS NINETY-SECOND ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS,Harrison's Landing, Tenn., October 13, 1863-10 a.m.

Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of the Cumberland:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report all quiet this a.m. At Penny's Ford the enemy have 1,900-Wood with 1,000 and Pegram with 900. Some of the citizens on the opposite side raised a black flag, which, the refugees on this side say, means that some one has been killed by the rebels, and that there is great danger.

I am, colonel, very obediently,

SMITH D. ATKINS,

Colonel Ninety-second Illinois Volunteers.

HARRISON'S LANDING, October 13, 1863-11 a.m.

Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of the Cumberland:

COLONEL: My pickets along the river report hearing the cars running opposite here last night and this morning. Considerable activity was evident, but the road is so distant the trains could not be counted and it was difficult to tell which way they were running, but supposed to be up the river.

I am, colonel,

SMITH D. ATKINS,

Colonel Ninety-second Illinois Volunteers.
