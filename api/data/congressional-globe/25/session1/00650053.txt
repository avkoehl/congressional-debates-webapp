tive hid acted independently oí the other branches
of the Government, as m the case of the Bank of
the United States, the removal of the deposites, the
Treasury enculai, &c and had now only called
Congress togethei, not lo devise the best mearis for
relieving the country, but to share with him in the
res, onsibihty of his present schemes Mr L denied
the existence ol any exigenej leqmrmg the with-
holding of the fouith instalment iiom the States,
since there was no proof theie was a deficit, and;
even if there was, the resources of the country,
from the cotton staple of the South the gram of the
West, the manuf ictmes of the North, and the
commence of the ocean, would be ample to meet
the payment, even if it was necessary to effect a
tempoiary loan till thoss resouices came in
Mi IONES followed in support of the bill, and
went at4aige into an examination of the condition
of the freasiny at the passage of the deposite act,
and since that time up to the present period He
denied that there was any obscunty in the repoit of
the Secretaiy of the Treasiuj, and he had prepired
a statement frogi it showing most conclusively that
the mt ms now at the control oí the Treasurj vv ere
not only insufficient to meetlhe existing demands
upon it, but that there would be a deficiency oí
several millions of dollars, viz that the means
amounted to something over sixty-sii millions, the
liabilities to upwards of eighty-eight millions, and
the balance, 01 deficiency, to above twenty-one mil-
lions and a h ilí [Mr J entered into avanety of
statistical and arithmetical statements,which render
a synopsis of his remarks impracticable in the short
♦íme allowed to prepare the paper foi the press,
but they will be published in lull as soon as
they are written out ] In the first place he argued
from ihe foregoing statements, that the bill was in-
dispensable, and next tint it was a proper, legal,
and equitab'e one, and not moonsisteit with the
intent m, sp,tit, or letter of the deposite ?ct of
1836, a measure vvInch he also reviewed In con-
clusion he said, that after long and patient investi-
gation, he had become satisfied that the amount re-
quired to be setapait by this bill, was absolutely
necessaiv, and he should therefore give it his cor-
dial support

by Mr J as to the condition of the Treasury on

Mr ATHERTON follow ed on the same side,
and contended that a sufficient case had been clear-
ly made out in the report of the Secietaiy of the
Treasury, leqturmg the passage of this bill.
Mr A also replied to the remarks of several
gentlemen who had preceded him He in-
sisted that the condition oí the Treasury
was such that the fourth instalment could not be
paid without creating a loan for the purpose He
denied that it partook of ihe character of a debt to
the States, oi that it was so intended by the
original frameis of the depos te act It was de-
s gned only asa provision for depasiting a surplus.,
and that surplus an available one No such surplus
now remaining, the necessity ofthis act wasrendered
absolutely indispensable He said that from what
had fallen from gentlemen, who ascribed all the
present embarrissirents to the destruction of that
institution, the issue had been proclaimed of the
Bank of the United States or no haul , an issue that
when on"e made before the people would be attend-
ed with the same result as on OV- former occasion
Mr FOSTER supported the amendment of Mr
Pickens merely to postpone the payment of the
íourth instalment till January, 1839, which offered
a ground on which both the advocates and the op-
ponents of the bill ought to meet He was opposed
to pass the bill postponing the payment indefinitely,
because he held that it ought to be paid, though he
granted and believed that the present means
of the Treasury vveie exhausted, and that this
payment could not be made without incurring
a loan, or making a farther issue of Treasuiv
notes than was contemplated by the bill rcpoited
from the Committee of Wavs and Means To
withhold the payment altogether w ould 1 r a breach
of good faith, for the Slates regarded it as a dona-
tion, had treated it as Mien, ami made a disposition
for the forthcoming instalment He repeated that
he prefened the bill with the amendment, but even
should the amendment be rejected, he could not, in
the present embariassed state of the Trcasuiy, bring
himself to v ote against the bill without it. Mi T
ad Iressed the committee at length on the var-
ious topics embraced
Mr BRIGGS opposed the bill, on the ground
that the non-pa} merit would be a bieach of contract
between the Government of the United States and
the States, independent of 'he inconvenience the
latter would be put to fiom having made provisions
for the investment of the money Mr B argued
this point for same time, when
Mr MERCER obtained the floor, on w hose mo-
tion the committee rose and reported

CALHOUN S amendment being under considera-
tion—
Mr  TALLMADGE addressed the Senate m a
speech of great length     He commenced by advert-
ing to the leldtionshtp m which he sftodto the Presi-
dent, who came fiom the  same county -with, ham-
self, and was the friend oí  his early political life,
and the considerations, pers mal and political, that
induced him to weigh well and to give serious and
deliberate attention to all subjects coming from such
high authority     He felt constrained to declare that
the Message of ihe Piesident hid not convinced
him of the eflic encv of ihe pi.ns proposed, and
until his judgment was satisfied, he would never
jipld his assent     Mr  T   then went into a long
argument to prove the Sub-Treasurv scheme was
naught with incalculable mischief to the country
It was no new measure as was supposed    Thw
scheme had been before the House oí Representa
tives, wheie it had been amply discussed and was
fully considered    The scheme v as biought for-
ward bv an opposition member, and was treated as
an opposition measure, though He mu-t do the op-
positit n the juttice to sav,  that it did not meet
with   their   united   support,   most   of  the   gen-
tlemen   of    that   paitj   believng   it  still   more
detrimental in its consequences than the plan sub-
mitted bv the administration m relation to the de-
posite banks, and after all the efforts made to sus-
tain it, there vveie but tlnrty-thiee votes brought to
its support, as the journal of the House of Repie 
sentatnes would show     In what light were we to
consider it now?   So odious did it ll en appeal, that
it was denounced as an opposition measuie,   ie\o-
lutionaiy in its charactei, wUd m all its fcatuies,
and calculated to bring the whole powei of the Go-
vernment to the footstool of the Executive, besides
svibiecting the Treasurj to be plundered bv faithless
agents     These «ere the reasons then given ioi not
adopting  it,  and  he corceived them to be no less
weighty now than they weie  then     It was said
here and elsewhere, that the only piaetieable sub-
stitute for the  Bank of the United States w^as the
State institutions      He never believed  that  the
State banks could do as well as the United States
Bank, but they weie che only substitute     Accord-
ing to the Message of President Jackson, the} did

sure had received the sanction of the whole part',
