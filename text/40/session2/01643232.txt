THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 17,
speech the other day, spoke of our relieving
the manufactures of the country. He spoke
then of the necessity of passing this bill,
though it had not then even been reported to
the House. But I suppose he was anxious to
speak upon it, and took that opportunity to do
so, for fear another opportunity would not
present itself. He referred to the fact that we
had relieved certain people from taxation, and
argued that we should therefore take off the
tariff duties upon other articles. Now I want
to say a word or two in reply to the gentleman
from Maine, and other gentlemen who go with
him in favor of this bill, and particularly of
the principles contained in this second section.
Sir, before we took the tax off manufactures
we relieved this ship-building interest by taking
off the tax from everything that entered into
ship-building. And I was one of the foremost
in endeavoring to get that done, offering an
amendment for that purpose. In reality we
relieved the ship-building interest from taxa-
tion before we relieved the other interests.
Therefore the argument of the gentleman made
at any time is not a good one. That is all I
have to say about that.
I wish to protect this interest, but I shall
vote against this second section. If I cannot
succeed in striking that section out I shall
very gladly support the amendment of the gen-
tleman from the Johnstown district of Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. Mokrell.]
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. Will
the gentleman allow me to ask him a question?
Mr. MYERS. Certainly.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I
would ask the gentleman if he is in favor of
relieving the industrial interests of the country
from the very heavy tariff they have been obliged
to pay upon wood-screws, the patents for which
we have been asked by the gentleman to ex-
tend? [Laughter.]
Mr. MYERS. I will answer the gentleman,
although his question is not very relevant.
Whenever he can show that the industrial in-
terests of the country are unduly taxed in any
way I will go with him to relieve them from
taxation. And whenever I show him that any
measure proposed here is one which will tend
to oppress the industrial interests of the coun-
try I shall expect him to go with me in oppos-
ing it.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I presume it
is hardly necessary to urge upon the attention
of this House the great importance, the great
national importance, of taking immediately
some steps to regain the position which, before
the rebellion we held as a great maritime Power.
The truth of that wise saying of one of Eng-
land's most sagacious statesmen, "that they
who control the commerce of the world con-
trol the wealth of the world, and they who
control the wealth of the world control the
world itself," is, I think, too well appreciated
here to need any argument from me to secure
recognition. Sir, I take it that it is only neces-
sary to ascertain what measures are needed
to restore our lost commerce, and with it our
lost advantage in the race for commercial
supremacy in order to secure their adoption.
While I do not believe in the policy of forcing
into existence interests by governmental aid
which can never stand alone, and which can
only be sustained by the constant and continual
support of the Government, I do believe it to
be the true policy of every nation to aid, pro-
tect, and foster every great national interest
that can by such protection and fostering care
attain a position where it can sustain itself.
That the commercial interest of this countrv
can become self-sustaining would not admit of
a doubt, even if the fact had not been demon-
strated by actual experience. A country
abounding in all the material for the construc-
tion of ships, possessing a vast extent of sea-
coast. indented with the finest bays and har-
bors to bo found in the world, that produces
and consumes every article known to com-
merce, and is inhabited by as hardy and enter-
prising a racc of men as ever peopled any
country, has surely all the elements of a great
commercial nation. It is only necessary to
refer to the statistical tables to show the com-
manding position we had attained as a com-
mercial nation prior to the recent great civil
war through which we have just passed. The
following table shows the relative increase of
American and English tonnage in each decade
from 1830 to 1860 inclusive :

Showing an increase of American tonnage
in these thirty years of nearly three hundred
and fifty per cent, to an increase of English
tonnage of about one hundred and fifty per
cent.
The following tables, covering the period
from 1801 to 1866, inclusive, show a loss in
American tonnage in six years of 1,043,090
tons, or about twenty per cent; while the ton-
nage of Great Britain in the same time in-
creased 1,402,615 tons, an increase of about
twenty-five per cent.

A comparison of the tonnage engaged exclus-
ively in the foreign trade would show still more
to our disadvantage ; as the American tonnage
engaged exclusively in the coastwise trade has
during this period considerably increased.
Let us now see how we stand in relation to
the carrying trade of the world. The follow-
ing tables show the amount of American and
foreign tonnage entering the ports of the Uni-
ted States from foreign countries in different
years from 1830 to 18GG:

186 7  290,675,185 577,627,754
These tables show that while in 1860 we had
engaged in foreign commerce to and from
American ports more than double the amount
of tonnage employed by all other nations, in
1806 the figures had become reversed, and the
foreign tonnage engaged in this trade nearly
doubled that of the United States, and that the
amount in value of foreign commerce to and
from American ports had fallen off in the same
proportion.
A still more startling proof of the decadence
of our influence in the foreign carrying trade
is afforded by contrasting the business done
by American, British, and French vessels
between ports foreign to each class of vessels.
In 1853 the American tonnage engaged in this
trade was 4.004,013 tons to 3,363,121 British
and 854,029 French, nearly as much as both
put together. In 1800 the American tonnage
was nearly six million to 4,700,000 British and
1,300,000 French, about the same proportion.
In 1865 American tonnage had fallen to about
three million tons, and that of Great Britain
had risen to 7,000,000 tons. The following
table from the reports of the Bureau of Statis-
"In the official tables the American tonnage enter-
in** from foreign countries m 1803 U put down at
3,372,060; but this is the new measurement, which
would be reduced fifteen per ccnt. to bring it to the
old standard.

If anything further were needed to prove
the disastrous effects of the war and taxation
upon our shipping interests, it will be found
by an examination of the subjoined tables of

Sir, no language of mine can add force to
facts like these. They show conclusively that
our foreign commerce has been nearly autiiln-
i lated by the war iu consequence of the'in.ibility

They furnish also a key to the motive that
