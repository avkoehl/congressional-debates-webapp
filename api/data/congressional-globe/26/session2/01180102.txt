UNIFORM BANKRUPT LAW.
Mr CRITTENDEN moved that the Senate now
take up the bill to establish a uniform system of
bankruptcy
Mr KING asked the honorab'e Senator from
Kentucky whether he made the motion for the pur-
dose of submittiDgan amendment to the bill, or for
the purpose of discussion by the Senate
Mr CRITTENDEN replied, that the latter was
his object, and he called for the ayes and noes on
the motion.
Mr BENTON said he considered this a motion
which would go to the destruction of the pre emp-
tion bill, and if it were adopted, he should consider
the pre emption bill voted down for this session
The adoption of a motion of that magnitude, at
this short sesssion, wouid be equivalent to a decla-
raron that the Senate would not again touch th 
pre emption bill this session, and therefore he
should vote against it
Mr WALKER was not wdling tiat aiy Sena-
tor, whether fuend or foe, should create an issue
for him, or dictate his course here (n this subject
He was in favor of a pre-emption law, he was also
m favor of the cession bill, but much as he favored
both, ht knew there was no bill ever introduced
into this body, m regard to a speedy action on
which his constituents vvtre <-o unanimous, as on
tne bankrupt bill In the State of Mis is-
sippi, all parties, Whigs and Democrats, ciedi-
tors as«well as deb'ors, solvent or insolvent,
were in favor of the passage of the bank-
rupt bill If there was a single individual there
lhat was opposed to it, he had not the honor of his
acquaintance. Under these circumstances, he
should feel it to be his duty to vote to take up the
bankrupt bill, and he would go further, and say
that if either the pie-cmption bill or the bankrupt
bill was to be delayed in i s passage fGr want of
time at the present session, he should undoubtedly
prefer that the former should be delayed ralherthan
the latter, for tnere was more unanimity in his
State in favor of -peedy action upon the latter, and
more earnestness about its immediate passage, and
for this reason he should vote for its being taken
up As the ayes and noes had been called on
the motion made for that purpose, he had thought
it proper to make these remark .
Mr KING vas suiprised at the course taken
in regard to the bill e hieli had been so long under
discussion, if the motion now made should prevalí,
it would prevent final action on the pre emption
bill, although it had beei discus ed diy after day,
for so many diys, and the discussion was now
cominp-to a cloce And yet when the biU was m
that stage, a new subj ct was urged upon the Se
nate, wmrh could not be pas ed at the present «es-
pión without a discussion of some aays Were
Senators then, m this state ofafTars,in fatorof
thiowing aside a measure aUeadv matured for
final action, and erery thing else, for a bill which
would engage th ir attention  o long'
Mr WALKLR Yts, I am, Id the Bank-
rupt bill having passed at the Ust session through
the Senate, after several months'debatí, might now
be earned immediately tluough this body, and
produce no njunous delay as to the pie emption
bill.
Mr KING obseived, the Senate had taken up
a subject of great importance, it had been discussed
With'hecilmnes^ and with  he minnsene01? which
Us importance required, and now, at the close of
the discussion, it was to be thrown aside, and final
action was to be avoided, that they might take up
another subject that would consume muoh of the
remaining time of the session If the Senator
from Mississippi was friendly, as he said he was,
to both these measures, he (Mr King) should con-
ceive he would first pass one of them, take up the
other, and pass lhat too as soon as possible, but
the course pursued by the Senator from Missis-
sippi would appear to betray but little friendship
for the pre-emption bill, if, by voting for the motion
of the Ssnator from Kentucky, he should give it
the go-by.
Mr. WALKER said he intended to give what he
knew would be the vote of his constituents, if they
were on that floor, and notwi hstandmg the surprise
of the honorable Senatoi from Alabama, he should
persist in his intention to vote for taking up the
bankrupt bill, whenever a molioa was made to
take it up, and to give it the precedence of all other
bill- on the calendar. His constituents were more
deeply interested m the immediate passage of the
bankrupt bill then any other They were in favor
of a pre-emption bill, and so was he, they were in
favor of the cession bill, and so was he but they
were more deeply interested in passing the bank-
rupt bill at the present session
Mr. BENTON.   But one is ripe for final action.
Mi WALKER And so is the other, and hsd
already passed ¡he Senate at the last session, and
hs hoped could now pass the Senate without delay,
and it seemed as though the debate on the pre-emp-
tion bill would be interminable
Mr YOUNG said it was known at the last ses-
sion that he was in favor of the bankrupt b 11, but
he was not willing to give it precedence of all other
bills He was willing to give it precedence of
all other business after the ditposal of lhat which
had been so lone under discussion
Mr BENTON „aid the graduation bill was the
next m order after the pre-emption bill, and as they
had been discussed together, it was desirable that
they should be 'isposed of together But if they
were to be thrown aside, and killed by a side blow,
it was perfectly immaterial whether the blow came
from friend or foe, death was death, come the blow
whence it might To throw, then, tho^e bills by,
after they had had a fuU discussion—for the drcus-
3 on had gone to both—and to take up one of the
magnitude of the bankrupt bill, on which several
Senators would have something to say, was to
throw tl-em by altogether, and to kill them by a
side blow.
Mr LUMPKIN should vote against postponing
the bills already discussed, to give precedence to
the bankrupt bill, but he had no hesitation m say-
ing that the Senate had abundance of time to act,
and to act deliberately, on every subject then be-
fore the Senate. He should thus vo e, because one
important measure was ready for decision, and
he acted on this principle, that when he had many
things to do, he wou'd do one thing at a time, and
he would do the most important first
Mr WALKER had not made the motion then
before the Senate, ne>r was he aware that the Sena-
tor from Kentucky wis about to make it, but it
having been made, h* should give such a vote as
his constituents would give if they were on this
floor He knew his constituents preferred imme-
diate act on on the bankrupt bill, and that delay, as
to the passage of that bill, would be more inju-
rious to them than delay as to any other mea
sure, but he should not have made any ren«arks, if
the proposition of compromise suggested by the
Senator from Kentucky, to take up the bankrupt
bill immediately after the pre-emption bill, had not
been rejected by the opponents of the bankrupt bill,
and ad sposition manifested to prevent sny action
on that bill at th s session He said he had no
fear that his constituents would m s^pprehend his
cour e rn this subject, or that any Sena or < n this
floor could in li ce any one citi¿-> i r i Miss s-ippi to
