Brigadier General T. J. McKEAN,

Paola, Kans.:

At 3 o'clock this morning 60 bushwhackers were 12 miles southeast of here, robbing and plundering the inhabitants. I got the news at a quarter before 5, and by 5 o'clock had troops out in all directions to try to cut them off. As we got a good start I hope to have some account of them by to-morrow.

CAPTAIN: The enemy under Coope have moved into Fishertown, a few miles this side of North Fork Town.

Colonel Adair, with 40 men, got back to Hillabee fire days ago, his horses run down, reporting 40 killed and all the rest deserted. It is possible that some of his command are above. He led 300 or 400 men. Move rapidly this way and keep a good lookout. We have not heard from your for eight days. I send these messengers to put you on your guard and to see if there are any bands below you or between you and me. The Arkansas River is deep, past fording. Two boats have been up. Send we word where you are. I want the command back.
