While the commanding general does not think all of Mott's division could be spared, yet supposes you may be able to detach some part of it to General Warren. He desires to know about this and what part of it can, in your judgment, be spared.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 11.45 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The dispatch of 10.50 just received. General Mott's entire division is in position on the line. One brigade of his might be spared by returning the brigade of colored troops to their old position on the line.

Major-General.

General WHITE,

Commanding Division, Ninth Corps, or

COMMANDING OFFICER TROOPS RELIEVING GENERAL WHITE:

SIR: I have just received the inclosed dispatch from General Warren. The Strong house is not far distant from the Jones house, a little to the south of west. You will perceive that this materially shortens your original line. General Warren has directed his picket-line to move forward. You should direct your left to move forward in connection with General Warren's, preserving the alignment and you connection to the right. Please be on the lookout for any movement of the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 11 a. m.

General PARKE:

GENERAL: I have thrown an infantry picket across from my right, striking your at the Strong house. I have taken off the cavalry that connected with yours, and all that part of your line south of the Strong house can be withdrawn. My picket-line is directed to move forward, and I hope to get it to the front so as to connect with your most western point.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
