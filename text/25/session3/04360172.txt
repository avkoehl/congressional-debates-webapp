Abolition Petitions—Mr. Morris.
&ENATE.
necessary to render the District a valuable and
comfortable situation for that purpose, and that
Congress have full power to do whatever is ne-
cessary for this District, and if to abolish slavery
be necessary to attain the object, Congress have
Fower to abolish slavery m the District I am sure
quote the gentleman substantially and I thank
him for this precious confession m his argument,
it is what I believe, and I know it is all I feel
disposed to ask If we can, then, prove that this
District is not as comfortable and convenient a
place for the deliberations of Congress, and the
eomfort of oui citizens who may visit it, while
slavery exists here, as it would be without slavery,
then slavery ought to be abolished, and I trust
we shall have the distinguished Senator fiom
Kentucky to aid us m this great national refoim-
ation I take the Senator at his woid I agiee
with him that this ought to be such a place as ho
has described, but I deny that it is so And upon
what facts do I rest my denial > We are a Chris-
tian nation, a moral and religious people 1 speak
for the free States, at least for my own State, and
what a contract does the v< ry streets of youi
capital dai'y present to th( Christianity and mo
rahty of the nation' A race of slaves, or at least
coloied persons, ot every hue, fiom the jet black
African, in regulai gradation up to the almost
pure Anglo Saxon coloi Dining the short tune
official duty has called me heie, 1 have seen the
really red haired, the fr< elded, and the almost
white negro, and I have been astonished at the
numbers of the mi\cel race whi n < ompaied with
those of full coloi, and I have deeply deplored
this slam upon our national moials, and the
words of Doctor Chanmng have, thousands of
times, been impressed on my mind, that " a slave
country reeks with licentiousness "
How comes this amalgamation of the races ' It
comes from slavery. It is a disagreeable annoy
anee to persons who come from the free States,
rspeemlly to their Christian and rnoral feelings
It is a great hinderance to a proper discharge of
their duties while here Rtmove slavery fiom thus
Distuct, and this evil Will disappiai W< aiguc
thi"! circumstance alone as a ¡sufficient cause to
produce that cfiict But slavery pie's  nts within
the District other and still morí appalling scenes
—scenes will calculate d to nwakin the d<epest
emotions of the human heart The slave tiadi
exists heie in all its irbnnoits, and unwlupped of
nil its crimes In virwof the very chair you
now occupy, IVTr Fiemdent, if the massy walls
of this building did not pit vent it, you could see
the puson, the pen, the hell, where human
bei igs, when purchased for sale, are kept, until
r aigo can bo procuted foi transportation to a
muthein or foreign market, for t have little doubt
that slave-, are tarried to Texa« for sale, although
I do not know th< fact
Sir, since Congiess have been in session, a
mournful group of these unhappy beings, some
tlinty or forty, weie marched, as if in derision
of your members of Congiess, m view of youi
Capitol, chained and manacled together, in open
ileylight, yes, in the veiy face of heaven ltmlf,
t > be shipped at Baltimoie for a foreign market
I did not witness this cruel transaction, but
speak from what I have heard and believe Is
this District, then, a fit place fot oui delibera-
tions, whose feelings are outraged with impunity
with transactions like this > Suppose, sir, that
mournful and degrading spectacle was at this
moment exhibited under the windows of our
Chamber do you think the Senate could delib-
erate, could continue with that composuie and
attention which I see around me  JNo,gn, all
your powers could not preserve ordei foi a mo-
ment The feelings of humanity would over-
come those of regard for the peculiar institutions
ot the States, and though we would be politically
and legally bound hot to intcifere, we are not
morally bound to withhold our sympathy and
our execration m witnessing such inhuman traf-
fic This traffic alone, m this Distuct, rendéis
it in uncomfortable and unfit place for your scat
of Government
S r, it 1^ but one or two yeais since I saw stand-
ing at the rulioad depot, as I pissed fiom my
bo rdmg he t be to th s Chamber, some large wag-
ons and teams, as if waiting foi freight, the cars
had not then arrived    I was inquired of, when I
returned to my lodgings, by my landlady, if I
knew the object of those wagons which I saw in
the morning I replied I did not, I suppose they
came and were waiting for loading " Yes, foi
slaves," said she, " and one of those wagons was
filled with little boys and little gnls, who had
been bought up through the country, and were to
be taken to a southern market Ah, sir," con-
tinuea she, " it made my very heart ache to see
them " The very recital unnei ved and unfitted
me for thought or reflection on any other subject
for some time It is scenes like this, of which
ladies of mv country and my State complained in
their petitions, some time since, as rendering this
Distuct unpleasant, should they wish to visit the
capital of the nation as wives, sisteis, daughters,
or fi lends of members of Congrí ss Yet, sir, these
rf spectable females were treated here with con
temptuous sneers, they were compared on this
floor to the fishwomen of Pans who dipped their
fingers m the blood of revolutionary Fiance Sir,
it the transaction in slaves here which I have men-
tioned could have made such an impression upon
the heart of a lady, a resident of the Distuct, one
who had been used to slives, and was probably
an owner, what would be the feelings of ladies
fiom the fiee Stues on beholding a like tiansac
tion' I will leave every gentkman and eveiy
hdy to answer foi themselves lam unable to
descnbp it Shall the capital of your countiylon
ger exhibit scenes so revolting to humanity that
the 1 uhes of your country cannot visit it without
disgust' No, wipe off the foul stain, and let it
become a suitable and comfoi table place for the
s at of Government The Senatoi, as if conscious
that his argument on this point liad pioved too
much, and of course had proven the converse of
what he wished to establish, concluded this part
by saying that, if slaveiy is abolished, the act
ought to be confined to the city alone We thank
him for this small sprinkling of correct opinion
upon this and waste of public feeling Label ty
may yet vegetate and grow even hir<
The ¡Senator insists that the States of Viiginia
and Mmyland would ntver hav* ceded this Dib
tnct if they had thought slavery would ever have
hem abolished in it This is an old story twice
told It was nevei, however, thought of until
the slave pow< r imagined it, foi its own secuuty
Let the States ask a retioci ssion of the Distiu t,
and I am suie the fiee States will rejoice to make
the giant
I he Si nator condemns the Abolitionists for
desning that slavery should not t xist m the Ter-
ntorie-., even m 1'loitda lie insists that, by the
treaty, the inhabitants of that country have the
right to remove the n iffich when they please
and that, by this condition, they have the right to
íetain theirslaves as cfTu is, independently of the
nowei of Congiess I am no diplomatist, sir, but
I vemuic to deny the conclusion of the Senatoi's
argument In all our intercomse with foreign
nations, in all our tieaties m which the wouis
" ¿oods, effects, ' &r ,au used, slaves have nevei
been consideied as included in all casesm which
slaves are thosubjeet mattt i of contioveisy they
aie specially named by th vv old " slaves " and,
if I remember rightly, it has been decided in Con
gressllmtsl ívtsarenotpropeity foi which acorn
pensation shall he made wlu n taken foi public
use, (or rather slaves cannot be consideied as
taken foi public use,) or as property by the en
emy, when they are in the service of the United
States If I am coriect, as I believe lam, in the
positions I have assumed, the gentleman can say
nothing, by this part of his areument, against
Abolitionists for asking that slaveiy shall not
exist in Ploutla
The gentleman contends that the powei to íe-
move slaves fiom one State to anothei, foi sale,
is found in that pmt of the Constitution which
gives Congiess the power to legulate eommeice
within  the States, iLc     Tins argument is non
sequilm, unless the honoiable Senator can fiist !
piovc  tint slaves   are piopei   articles foi   com   i
mcice     We say that Congress have power over I
slaves only as peisnns     'Hie United States can I
piotict pp sons, bnt cannot male them piepeity
and thej have full powei in legulatmj; commerce, ,
and can, in  such regulations, piohibit from its
operations  eveiytlung  but  piopeity    propeity
made so by the laws of natuie, and not by any
municipal regulations The dominion of man
over things, as property, was settled by his Cie*
ator when man was fiist placed upon the earth
He was to subdue the earth, and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, the fowls of the air, and
over every living thing that moveth upon the
eaith, every herb bearing seed, and the fiuit of
a tree yielding seed, was given foi his use This
is the foundation of all right in property of eveiy
description It is foi the use of man the grant
is made, and of course man cannot be included
in the grant Eveiy municipal legulation, then,
of any State, or any of its peculiar institutions
which makes man property, is a violation of this
great law of natui e, and is founded m usurpation
and tyranny, and is accomplished by force, ft aud,
or an abuse of power It is a violation of the
principles of truth and justice, m subjecting the
weaker to the stronger man. in a Christian na-
tion such property can form no just ground for
commercial regulations, but ought to be stnctly
prohibited I theiefore believe it is the duty of
Congress, by virtue of this power to legulate
eommeice, to prohibit, at once, slaves being used
as articles of trade
The gentleman says the Constitution left the
subject of blavery entirely to the States To this
position I assent, and,as the States cannot regu-
late their own commerce, but the same being the
light of Congiess, that body cannot make s'aves
an aiticle of eommeice, because slaveiy is leften-
tirely to the States in which it exists, and slaves
within those States, according to the gentleman,
are excluded fiom the power of Congress Can
Congress, in íegulatmg commerce among the sev-
eial States, authome the transportation of articles
fiom one State and their sale in another, which
they have not power so to authorize in any State'
I cannot believe in such doctrine, and I now sol-
emnly protest against the power ot Congress to
authorize the tiansportation to, and the sale in,
Ohio, of any negro slave whatevei, or for any
possible purpose under the sun Who is there in
Ohio, or elbewhere, that will dare deny this posi-
tion s If Ohio contains such arecieant to her con-
stitution and policy, I hope he may have the bold
ness to stand forth and avow it If the States in
which slaveiy exists love it as a household god,
let tin m keep it there, and not call upon us in the
fiee States to offer incense to then idol We do
not seek to touch it with unhallowed hands, but
with pure hands, upraised in the cause of truth
and suffciing humanity
The gentleman admits that, at thefoimation of
our Government, it was feaied that slavery might
eventually divide oi distract ourcountiy, ind.as
the Bali oi box seems continually to haunt his
imagination, he says theie is real danger of dis
solution of theUnion, if Abolitionists,as is evident
they do, will can y their piinciples into the bíli ot
box It not disunion in fact, at least in feeling,
in the country, which is always the piecursor to
the clash of aims And the gentleman further
says wc arc taught by holy writ, " that the race
is not to the swift, noi the battle to the strong "
1 he moial of the gentleman's argument is, that
truth and nghteousness wi'l [ revail, though op-
posed bvpowci and influence tint <íbohtiomsts,
though fi w in numbei, aie git illy to be feaied,
out, as I have said, may chase a thousand, and
two put ten thousand to flight, and, as their
weapons, of warfare arc not "carnal, but mighty
to the pulling down of strongholds," even sla
vety itself, and as the ballot box is the gieat
moral lever in political action, the gentleman
would exclude Abolitionists entnelyfn m its use,
and, for opinion's sake, deny them this high pnv
liege of every American cm¿en Pcimit me, sir,
to lemind the gentleman of anothei text of He ly
Win " The wicked flee when no man puisueth,
but the righteous aie bold as a lion " The Sen-
ator says that those who have slaves aie some-
times supposed to be undei too much alarm
Does this, pi ove the application of the text I have
just q loted ? " Conscience sometimes makes
i iwauls of us a1] " 1 he Senatoi ippeals to Abo
httonists and beseeches them to cease their eftoits
on the su ject of sliverj, if thev wish, says he,
"to exercise tl en benevolence " What1 Abo
htiomsts benevolent' He hopes they v ill select
some ob)ect not so temblé Oh, sir, he is willing
they should pay tithes of "mint and rue," but
