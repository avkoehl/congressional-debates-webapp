HEADQUARTERS CHIEF ENGINEER OF DEFENSES,Washington, May 20, 1865.

Respectfully returned.

I have caused the Aqueduct Bridge over the Potomac to be examined. I have no doubt of its strength to carry over a drove of elephants. But there ought, nevertheless, to be a pontoon bridge laid from the foot of Washington street, Georgetown, to Analostan Island, is any considerable portion of the army is to return to the south side of the river after the proposed review, otherwise there must be great delay in marching by file through so narrow a bridge. The troops would pass from this island over the causeway to the mainland and under the aqueduct arch of the canal, without interference with the other column over the Aqueduct Bridge.

Lieutenant-General and Aide-de-Camp.
