HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON,June 15, 1863-8. 30 p. m.

Colonel JEWETT,

Commanding at Poolesville:

COLONEL: It would be well to draw in your infantry pickets, and get your command as well in hand as possible. The section of guns should certainly be with the main body. The general regrets that he can send you no more cavalry; that you have must make up by activity for lack of numbers. There is a commissary depot near Edwards Ferry. Let the person in charge of it have timely warning if you have trouble. Cover all approaches to your position with cavalry patrols.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff.

Colonel JEWETT,

Commanding at Poolesville:

COLONEL: I did not wish you to understand by my telegram that your entire picket line of infantry was to be relieved, but to be withdrawn as far as was consistent with the safety of your command. The aqueduct at the Monocacy especially must not be left unguarded by infantry. Your line is a long and difficult one for your numbers, but it is impossible to send you more troops now. Something must be risked to save the canal.

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS STAHEL'S CAVALRY DIVISION, Fairfax Court-House, Va.,June 15, 1863-8. 45 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

A. A. G., and Chief of Staff, Dept. of Washington:

The scouting party which was sent out last night to aldie, Middleburg, and beyond, has returned, and report that they could hear of no enemy in force; only Mosby's and White's guerrillas are between Upperville and Ashby's Gap. The citizens do not know anything either of our or the rebel army's movements. I do not think that Stuart has crossed or is crossing at the mouth of the Monocacy, as I would be aware of it. If he crossed, he must have crossed above Harper's Ferry somewhere.

Respectfully,

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.
