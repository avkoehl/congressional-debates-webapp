General Wofford requests me to forward the following:

CARTERSVILLE, June 29, 1865.

The country through which the armies passed, from Chattanooga to Atlanta, is without corn or money. If the Government could loan or sell on credit 30,000 bushels of corn if would prevent much suffering and enable the farmers to complete the cultivation of their corps.
