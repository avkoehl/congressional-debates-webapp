now become of vast magnitude. I was myself thinking of a change of the line to support it when I received your dispatch. It will have to be made in the face of 50,000 if not 60,000 men, and is hazardous. I will answer definitely in the morning.

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, February 6, 1862.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL, Louisville:

The enemy is concentrating his forces on Fort Henry by railroad. It is said that Beauregard arrived there last night, but without his troops. The bombardment is now going on. The boats are in the Tennessee and the troops between that and the Cumberland. From what part of Green River can your advance a brigade to co-operate? If necessary, I can throw a column across the Cumberland to facilitate the movement.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, February 6, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

I propose to send the brigade by water from the mouth of Green River, to form a junction with you.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, February 6, 1862-6.30 p.m.

General HALLECK:

Besides the brigade from Green River I can send you two regiments from Indiana and six from Ohio. Telegraph the Governor of Ohio the point at which you will have his regiments. Those from Indiana I have directed to Cairo, hearing that you want them there. Please let me know what you do. All these troops are raw, you know, and without any brigade organization. For the present I will request the Governor to arrange them in brigades, and direct the senior colonel to take command. Do you require light batteries?

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 6, 1862.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL, Louisville:

Send the brigade up the Cumberland, and I will have a gunboat at Smithland to protect the transports. They can land near Dover and operate on either side, as may be required. If we can reduce Fort Henry the gunboats will proceed up the river to destroy all bridges. I am satisfied that the enemy intend to make a desperate stand at that place, and will re-enforce it from Bowling Green and Columbus.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
