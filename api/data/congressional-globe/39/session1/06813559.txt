1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Committee on Finance, therefore, did not act
upon these appropriations, simply because we
had not satisfactory information on the subject.
Mr. DOOLITTLB. I do not wish to occupy
She time of the Senate, but will call to mind
two or three things in a very few words. It
will bo remembered that this estimate from the
Interior Department came at the very begin-
ning of the session. The estimate then was
SI, 100,000 for the purpose of keeping these
Indians from starving until something could
grow out of the ground for them to eat. It
went to the Committee on Indian Affairs. It
seemed very large. We had already paid out
a great deal of money for these Indians. A
proposition was made to furnish $500,000, and
as Congress would not probably adjourn until
spring, if that could not carry them on we would
pass another appropriation and help the thing
through. We could not let these Indians starve
on our hands. They were our friends, who
had been driven into Kansas on a.cconnt of
their loyalty to the Government. Under a law
of Congress the Secretary of the Interior had
been compelled to take them back to their own
country, where there was no corn and no vege-
tation growing. They were on our hands. It
was in the winter when nothing would grow.
The fact is that we did appropriate that
$500,000, and the Department has been con-
stantly pressing on us the consideration of this
additional appropriation which would be neces-
sary.
Mr. SHERMAN. Who furnished the money
to Mr. Sells?
Mr. DOOLITTLB. I do not know. I sup-
pose the contractors made contracts for the
delivery of these goods. I presume they have
kept delivering them right along.
Now, Mr. President,,the Committee on In-
dian Affairs, looking the subject all over, being
just as anxious as we could be to get rid of
this expenditure, came finally to the conclusion
to recommend the appropriation of $500,000,
which will pay for what has been expended,
and leave about one hundred and twenty-
five thousand dollars to carry the thing along
until the 1st of August. By that*time we
thought these Indians could live from what
grew out of the ground in that country, and
what game they could secure or fish they could
take in the river. Up to that point we were
willing to go; but there the matter was to stop,
and that was to be the end of any of this ex-
penditure for the purpose of sustaining these
refugee Indians. That was our conclusion.
It was with that view that we recommended
the passage of the joint resolution which we
reported, and .which we now propose to put as
an amendment on this bill. It seems to us to
be a necessity.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I should like to ask how
many Indians there are that the Department
has been feeding.
Mr. D O OLITTLE. There were about twenty
thousand of the northern Indians, and some
things were furnished after the war was over
to some of the southern Indians, who were suf-
fering also. I have here a detailed estimate, not
made by Superintendent Sells, going into all the
details. We put the amount down to the very
lowest figure that we could. It would not do
to let these Indians starve and let their blood
be upon our hands. Their rations are as low
as they can possibly be to live, in my opinion.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. DOOLITTLB. T will state that there
are some two or three matters connected with
Indian affairs in relation to some deficiencies,
one of them in the Territory of Nevada, but
they did not come to the committee in time to
enable us to consider them sufficiently to offer
them to this bill. We propose therefore to
offer them hereafter upon the miscellaneous
appropriation bill.
Mr. GRIMES. I offer the following amend-
ment to come in as an additional section:
And be it further enrtc ted, That any loyal person, a
citizen ol the United States, ol'goudmoralcharacter,
shall be permitted to trade with any Indian tribe
upon givius bond in the penal sum of not less than
So,000 nor more than $10,000, with at least two good
securities, to be approved by the superintendent of
the district within which such person proposes to
trade, renewable each year, conditioned'that such
person will faithfully observe all the laws and regu-
lations made for tho government of trade and inter-
course with Indian tribes, and in no respect violate
thesame: Provided. Ihat the laws now in force regu-
lating trade and intercourse wit h-Indian tribes, affect- [
ing licensed traders and prescribing tho powers and
duties of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, super-
intendents, agents, and sub-agents in connection
therewith, shall be continued in force and apply to
traders under this provision, except as herein other-
wise provided.
When the bill was under consideration in
the Senate which came from the special com-
mittee, I believe, of which the Senator from
Wisconsin [Mr. Doolitti.e] was chairman, I
submitted an amendment in general terms em-
bodying the idea that is embraced in this amend-
ment. It was adopted with great unanimity by
the Senate, and went to the House of Repre-
sentatives ; but the bill still'lingers in that body.
The amendment which I have now offered is
the substance of that, except that it has been
redrawn by a colleague of mine who is a mem-
ber of the Indian Committee in the House of
Representatives.
,Mr. TRUMBULL. I do not think there can
be any objection to the amendment.
Mr. GRIMES. The bill remains unacted
upon in the House of Representatives in con-
sequence of some inability to report it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If I understand that
amendment, the party gives a bond to comply
with all the regulations for keeping whisky and
contraband articles out of the Indian country.
That is so, is it not?
Mr. GRIMES. Yes, sir.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed. and the amendments were concurred in, and
ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read
a third time. It was read tlie third time and
passed.
On motion of Mr. SHERMAN, the title of
the bill was amended by adding the words,
"and for other purposes."
