must have recourse to some method ot raising mo
nev  for the exigencies of the Treasurj     How,
thei, can it be said thrt the Treasury does not need
tins money?
One chief argument, howevci, advanced by the
opponents of the bill, is, that it does not appear
that the sum in the Tieasury is less han what
would be required for the payment of the last in-
stalment He contended that it did so appear, and
that the conclusions of the Secretary were stated
definitely and explicitly, and the details leading to
those conclusion;, must appeal cleai and consistent
to those who would give to fie íepoit lhat atten-
tion which the nature of the lbject demanded
He had drawn up a statement, based on the report,
which, in hiii opinion, suffic*?ntiy showed this, and
which he had intended to lay belore the committee,
but as the committee were already weaned with
the subject, and ihe mattei had been so abl}
stated b, the gentleman from Virgim , he would
foibear from infl ding it on ihem But it seemed
to him that the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia had admitted a principle which at once decided
this question lhat gentleman, in reference to
Various statements of the condition of the Treasury
made upon this floor, tending to support the report
of the Secretary, has denied lhat they have any
weight, or ought to have any, because they hav e
not the seal oí responsioility—Vey contain no as-
surance from an} officer responsible to the House
Now, sa, we han a statement from an officei
responsible to the House—nom i'ie Secretas y of
the Treasury He is the oficcr to whom v c, a0 a
branch oí this  Gnu mi nt, apply for information
on tne state of the Treasuiy, and i n whose in-
formation we must bese oui pioceedings Tí he
deceive us, he is liable to impeachment Can it
be asserted that this ofhctr has int b ttcr means of
Knowing th" state of th« Tita ury tnan pny mem-
ber on this Moos1 What does lie Secretaiy say"*
He declaies that the whole amount in the Tieasmy
at the time his report was made, was only a little
over eight millions of dollai , and this includes
both available and unavailable funds Any per-
son, he believed, must, en careful'y perusing the
report, arrive at the same conck sion It must also
be evident that, after takin<* out the excess of the
expenses over the receipts for the month of S pfem-
1 er, the balance on the first of Ortohei u ill be not
much above "ix millions of dolíais, tin1 of this
balance, the availib'e funds will be only about two
millions of dollars
In whatever light it m y be tensd, the ques-
lion seems ti be, whether we shall bouow money
í jr the «-ake of depositing it with the State "Lie
gentlemai from Pennsyisdtii, , (Mi Sergeant,)
who ..c'dicssed the commit ec some d iys since, was
lindeistood to admit there would be a deficiency
m the Ireanuy, but to contend that the Secretary
was bound to make this deposite if there weie no
action oi Congress on the subject, and that the
question was whether we would stop this appro-
pna ton JNow he (Mr A ) thought it mcumbont
on g mlcmen to say how the S"cretaiy could, by
?qj possibil ly do this, unless there be som" action
of Congreso on the subject He thought it incum-
b nt aSo on those who contended there s such a
vast amount of money in the Tieasury, to mfoim
the S cietaiy where it may be found Noi coold
he com cue t to be other than a mis nplicat on
of tei  is to call this an appiopnation
The geitltman from Tenitssee (Mi Bell) has
sud tluu he views the question of makm, the de-
posite of the jas' instalment w th t States as i
qiostitn of fa¡ h, ike that of mal mg payment to
?n otntr eieeti tn Tohmi, ^Mi A ) the position
tl<it this was a eontiact seeme 1 utterly untenable
4re the Stat  •> our ceditors to the amount ot ihe
last instalment? What consideiat &n have we ie-
eeived for it? Has the money already deposited,
gone to pay our debts to the States? The ge'ifle
man from Ohio (Mi Loomis) contends that tae
Sates furnish a consideration b^c-nis- thpy aie
o )1 ged to agree to accept the mc ne/ and > pledge
&  f i \ or the States for itsiepaymeit Now,
ft iW > Mr Vs mind, sho.vert it to ht ? 1 po-
st c else wny so much caution as to securing t e
rcpiyment of the money when needed? All ihe
guatas ,uid auntie* to this end, prove that it was
t ie money of the United Sut"s, and not that of the
States The deposite law of 1836, both in its letter
and in its spirit, is a law for the safe-keeping of the
money of the United States We have power to
withdraw the money after its depo ite, if we need
it, and, of com e, to witbhi'd it The law was
based on the supposition of a surplus in the Trea-
sury, and an av ailable surplus
The gentleman fiom Temesste has said that he
considered this a question whether our expendi-
tures w ere to be reduced now or never, and con-
tends that the expenditui s unde- existing appro-
priations can be so re luced as to supersede any
necp sity of postponing the last instalment It
sepmet t him (Mr A ) bat this is shown U> be
utterly impracticable All expenditures have
already been postponed m the Secretary's estimates,
which, ?fter a most careful investigation, it was
found could prop"ily be dispensed \ ith for tb * pre-
sent It must ne apparent, that the gieatest reduc-
tion which could, by anv possibility, be made in the
evpendituies of the last thue months oí this year,
would not aHect the balance in the Ticasttry to an
amountsufheiuitto make any difference in the aspect
of the question under consideration As to the refe-
i ence made by that gentleman to thesum in the hands
of disbursing officers, it seemed only necessaiy tore-
co lect that tins sum is not m the Treasury, and
can in no manner be made applicable by the Se-
cietaiy m the nannei coitended foi Money in
the hands ol disbuisirg ofiiceis is charged, at once,
to appropriations winch are, by that so much le-
duecd, and of the amount refill i"d b} the last re-

hcved that a la sc majon y of the friends of the
administration would be fiu 11 as ready as the

portunities of i ldgmg Hi had, however, been
inclined to believe uVm s ncere, and before
he admitted the justice of the gentleman's im-
pu'ation ho wo Id liwe to inquire whether the
fi ends of the gentleman, the Na íonal Republicans
of the north, who have been cnaractenzed by the
gent eman from South Carolina (Mr Pickens) as
having reform on then lips and extravagm ce in
their hearts, had nothing to do with these extrava-
gant appropriations But it did seem to him (Mr
A ) (hat of all th extravagance ever heard of, of
all the extravagmcc which it evei entered into the

could not see how this chaige could bp sustained
It theie be msmceutv ehargeab'e any where, it
wou'd seem to him to appty much more forcibly to
those who advocated the p íssage of the law of
1836 as a  deposite law, and now contend that it

should be construed as a distribution law It is
w ithin the knowledge of all that the passage of
that law was urged on the ground th it it was
merely a law to regulate the deposites of our own
monej, and they are the persons v. ho really mani-
fest hostility to the principles of that law, vv ho now
view it m another Iigat By this they go far to sanc-
tion the justice and torce of the arguments used by
the opponents of tne law against its aaoption , for
it was earnestly contended, in opposition to its pas-
sage, that it would prove to be not what it pro-
fessed to be, but a distnbution la >'
As measures contained in other btlis reported by
the Committee of Ways and Means hal been al-
luded to, he might be permi *ed to notice a remark
of the gentleman from Tennessee, that the liue ob-
ject of the admmistiation was to cotaonsh aTiea-
sury bank, and that this object was alreadj indica-
ted by a propo ítiofi for the issue of a large amount
of Treasury notes for a currency It was unneces-
sary to refer to the various piecedents of such is-
sues by the Government, when no such irnputa-
tation was ever dreamed of These precedents are
familiar to all But how does the matter stand? If
the bill before the committee pass, time will be a
necessity for the issue of only ten millions, while,
lftt-ebill be defeated, an amount of twenty mil-
lions of notes will be required Thusi seemed to
him (Mr A ) that mis chaige would apply with
much more force to the opponents, than to the
friends of the bill befoie the committee
It was not without some surprise that I e heard a
call made on those m favor of State right to op-
pos this bill It seemed to h in that nothing could
so effctuaUy destroy State pr de, aul t e rights of
the States, as to make them tl = e?"\.i and humble
expect mts of the bounty of the Gereial Gk>\ em-
inent, to mtioiuee them here as requesting the Go-
v oi in lent to bonow moncv foi the purpose of dis-
tributing it among them The veri worst feature
of the pimciples of those who have upheld what
they call the American system is here discernible,
that which indicates the disposition to 1 eep up a
high tariff for protection, and to disregard the true
doctrine of limiting oar revenue to our expendi-
tures—an earlier observance of which would have
preserved us from many, if not all, of the difficul-
ties with which, of late years, this Government has
had to contend
Nor could he admit that the argument diawn
from the fact, that a postponement of the last in-
stalment might interfere with 'he domestic arrange-
ments of tne States, as to its disptsition, was a
legitimate argument The States nad no reason to
consider the money as their own, and any legisla-
ron founded on that supposition was, thus far,
nnpiovident legislation No one certainly re-
gretted any inconvenience to which the States
might be subjected more than himself His con-
st tuents would stiffpi their share of any such in-
convenience It was his opmit n, and he doubted
not that he agreed m this with a large majority of
his constraei ts, that we have no constitutional
right to raise money for the purpose of paying
mer this la=t instalment, and were the inconve-
niences which would result them to inr gicatei, he
could confidently sav they weie too patriots and
too much attached to the Constitution of then
country to desne the violation of so imponant a
pnncip'e But (he inconvenience woul!, n no
case, be very general or very great This money-
goes in too many ins'ances into the hands ol a
limited numbei of favored individuals, and m
some States tc the use of corpoiations, an 1 its dis-
tribution is, at best, a taxation of the many for the
benefit of a few
As allusions had been made to the Message of
the President, and to the existing embarrassments
of the country, together with the means of lehev-
mg them, Mi A would fenefly advert to these to-
pics We had heaid it said by gentlpmen of the
opposition that they did not come here prepared to
introduce or suggest any measures of lelief, yet
they had animadverted w th the greatest ¡«eveiity
on the Message of the President as proposing no
such measures Unles, thev knew of some mea
sure proper lo be suggested, would they be so un-
just as to conde nn the Piesident for not suggesting
it?   Yet it has been here staled  more than   once
