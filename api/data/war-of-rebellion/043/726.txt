tween Emmitsburg and Gettysburg, information was received that the First Corps, under General Reynolds, had come in collicion with the enemy near the latter place, and that an engagement was then in progress. The Eleventh Corps was ordered to hurry forward to reenforce the First. On arriving near Gettysburg, the brigade was put in position on Cemetery Hill, near to and south of the village of Gettysburg, for the purpose of covering the retreat of the First Corps, it having been compelled to fall back by the superior force of the enemy. The position assigned to this regiment was on the left of the brigade, on the road leading from Gettysburg to Taneytown, about 30 yards in front of the artillery, placed in position in our rear, on the crest of Cemetery Hill, and which artillery we were to support. The enemy's line of battle being directly in our front, we were placed between the fire of our own and the enemy's artillery. In the position assigned us, the regiment was deployed in line of battle behind a stone wall or fence, that fenced out the road from the adjoining field. The enemy threw out a strong line of sharpshooters or skirmishers directly in our front, and within musket range of our line. To meet this, a similar line of sharshooters or skirmishers was thrown out upon our front toward the enemy. The sharpshooters were posted at about 150 yards from those of the enemy. The enemy kept up an almost continuous fire upon our skirmishers, and our line of sharpshooters was placed in the houses in the village of Gettysburg, from which we were annoyed on our flanks. Our position was near the center of the line of battle. This regiment was the extreme left of the Eleventh Corps, and connected with the right of the Second Corps. This position substantially we occupied during the three days' battle of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the 1st, 2d, and 3rd instant, with the exceprion that on the evening of the 2nd we were ordered farther to the right, to assist in repelling an attack on our right wing, then in progress. The enemy were repulsed without our assistance, and we were ordered back to our former position. During the whole time we occupied this position, an almost continual conflict was kekpt up between the enemy's sharpshooters and ours. Three or more companies of this regiment were kept constantly detailed, and deployed as skirmishers, to take care of and keep at proper distance the enemy's aharpshooters. The regiment was also exposed to the terrific fire which the enemy brought to bear upon the position in our rear on Cemetery Hill. The loss of the regiment in killed, wounded, and missing was 108. It is needless for me to say anything of the good conduct of the officers and men of this regiment, as it was during the whole of the battle under the immediate supervision and observation of the colonel commanding the brigade. I may be allowed, however, to remark that for new troops, for the first time under fire, the conduct of both officers and men through the whole of this memorable contest is, in my judgment, deserving of the highest meed of praise, and that the coolness and bravery exhibited could not have been excelled even by veteran troops. I herewith inclose a list of casualties.

* I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES WOOD, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain B. F. STONE, Jr., Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
