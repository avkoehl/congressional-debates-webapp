Your orders will be obeyed with energy and dispatch. I will be at Tuscumbia to-morrow noon with, 1,300 sacks of grain and 60,000 rations; same amount will follow next day. The shoals between Eastport and Tuscumbia have only 28 inches water, and I must be cautious not to lose our boats. I have seized near Eastport three shoal pilots and paroled them under penalty of death if they run away. It was a military necessity, as without them we could not turn a wheel over the shoals. I have shown your orders to Captain Gay and the quartermasters. Our commissary's supplies will all be at Eastport to-morrow. I have established a pony express from Eastport via Sulphur Springs to Pittsburg Landing, with relay, so you may depend upon headquarters mail with out interruption.

FRANCIS DARR,

Captain and Commissary of Subsistence.

HAMBURG, June 10, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I leave to-day for Tuscumbia with 75,000 rations and abundant forage. Tuscumbia is the head of navigation at the highest stage of water on account of Muscle Shoals; therefore it is impossible to take supplies to Decatur by water. I will attend to supplies up there carefully and promptly. Will you be kind enough to order Captain Sinton to report to me for orders? I want him for the post at Tuscumbia, if you approve of it.

FRANCIS DARR,

Captain and Commissary of Subsistence.

NASHVILLE, June 10, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Mr. Anderson will commence operations at once on the Decatur Railroad. He desires me to say he has an organization ready for running to say there are two engines ordered to Columbus, Ky., to put on the railroad to run to Memphis. He wishes to suggest that orders be given that the engines go by river to Memphis, as all bridges are burned between there and Columbs.

OLIVER D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General
