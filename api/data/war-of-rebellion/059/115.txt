You will keep a part of your force between this place and Lawrenceburg, taking possession and guarding all roads leading to this place from the west and southwest. The map represents a road or bridle-path running from the Lawrenceburg road to the Lamb's Ferry and Lexington roads. If it is practicable you can move a force down on that road to the roads above mentioned. A force must be sent to the junction of the Lamb's Ferry and Lexington roads, or on each. It is impossible to give explicit instructions to govern all of your movements, as circumstances must in a measure control them; but look to all roads leading in from the directions above mentioned, and at the same time feel to the front as far as possible, gaining reliable information and forwarding the same to these headquarters without delay.

This detachment will return, bringing back any information you may have, as their services are needed here.

When you return you will throw out detachments in different directions under commissioned officers, and drive into this place all surplus stock, horned cattle, sheep, and hogs which can be founding the country, as the command here is entirely destitute. Proper receipts will be given by the commanding officers in accordance with existing orders. No family will be entirely stripped, but enough left for their support.

The officer sent in command of the detachment will be instructed to ascertain what action the boats take upon receiving the order. It is of the utmost necessity that this order is got to the boats immediately and is promptly obeyed by the same; therefore, select your ablest officer to see it executed.
