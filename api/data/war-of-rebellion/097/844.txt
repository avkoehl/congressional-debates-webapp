WESTERN RAILROAD CORPORATION,

Springfield, Mass., April 19, 1865. (Received 10.30 a. m.)

Honorable GEORGE ASHMUN:

Cannot the funeral train pass through a portion of New England? Do me the favor of tendeing to the War Department for that purpose a train from New York to Albany via New Haven, Hartford, and Springfiled. In no portion of our common country do the people mourn in deeper grief in New England. This slight divergence will take in the route the capital of Connecticut and also important points in Massachusetts.

C. W. CHAPIN,

President.
