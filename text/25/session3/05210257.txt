Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Davis.
Senate.
pursuant to his claim of exclusive jui ísdiction ?
That claim, though denied by oui Government,
is not i enounced by Sir John or Mi   I1 ox
Tuither, the anangement as to futuie tres-
passes, besides being; limited to notmtous tres-
p isseis, (leivmg all oidmaiy tiespusseis unpro-
vided foi,} is impiacticable, and will lead to new
collisions it is \ain to expect that two nations,
each claiming the whole pi opei ty, can, for any length
of time, exercise ajoijtf, concuDcnt jurisdiction
over it But if that could be done in some cases,
¡t cannot be done in the case undei considciation,
foi the obvious reason that ail the available pi oti-
tic! of this territory is the timber upon it, and
that timber must find a maiket in the Bntish P> ov-
tnces It is for the interest of merchants and otheis
in New Brunswick that this timber ¡should be cut
and disposed of through their agency, and that
interest is so strong and abiding that we cannot
!ely upon the provincial authorities to check or
pievent the continued abstraction of the timber
Whit has been maybe again, and notwithstand-
ing the boasted efforts of the warden of the dis-
puted teintory to stop and punish trespassers in
past years, it is known that the number of tres-
passer has been annually increasing The agree-
ment provides that whenever an armed force shall
be necessary to suppress notonous trespassers,
it shall be done by conceit between Maine and
New Brunswiek Suppose that another ycai
should be as the last has been, and Maine should
wish to expel and punish the trespasseis if New
Biunswick, for any cause, should not be dis-
posed to concur in measuies adequate to the
object, what remedy is left for Maine? Her rights
aie entnely at the mercy of New Brunswick'
But he would not detain the Senate. The ai-
rangement has been made, and may possibly be
less objectionable than he had supposed He
hoped it was so, and Mr W would gladly em-
biace, as he believed Maine would albo do, any
plan which should allay exis'ing excitement,and
promise a speedy settlement of the boundary ques-
tion That was the great question, and the ques-
tion which must soon be settled in some way. It
had already been too long delayed, in fact, that
boundaiy should nevei have been suffered to be
biouglu into question Any temporizing expe-
dient will avail but little, it may give some further
opportunity to attempt negotiation, and Maine
would not complain, but the time has come when
the General Government must bung the question
to a termination, by negotiation or otherwise
Maine has already borne and forborne beyond
what almost any other State would have done
She has hei rights, and knows them, she is yet
desiious that the General Government will assert
and secure them to hei, and, above all, she de-
sires not to distuib or put in hazard the peace of
the country Still, Maine must and will respect
herself, and thus acting, cannot much longer suf-
fer an important poition of her terutory to be in
doubt or abeyance. Whatever territory is hers
must be subject to her jurisdiction and to her
laws, and cannot be withheld from her much
¡ongor The business and wishes of the people
of Maine are peaceful, and it has taken a long
period of suffeung to bring about the spirit which
now pervades almost every bosom in Maine, and
that spirit is not to be overcome. She hopes to
obtain her rights peaceably, but be assured that
delay will soon be regarded denial, and then the
gallant spirit and perseveiance of her sons will
accomplish for her what ages of negotiation have
thus far failed to secure
Mr PRESTON said that he would not allow
himself to participate in the despondency with
which the Senatoi [Mr Williams] regarded the
condition of affairs on the Maine frontier, or to
believe that the recommendatory suggestions in
the memorandum signed by Mr Forsyth and Mr
Fox would be inefficacious in suspending the hos-
tile proceedings in the disputed territory. We
have been suddenly and unexpectedly humed
into an attitude menacing the most serious results,
and placing us at once, without any previous
action of this Government, upon the very edge of
war Indeed, nothing could have been more un-
expected to the public raind, or to the constituted
authorities of this Government, than the startling
events which have astounded us for the last few
days.   We may well judge from our own eicite-
No. 17
ment how much more intensely agitated are the
feeling  of those who are in the immediate pres-
ence of those events, and participators in them
It is, therefore, most desirable that there should
be a moment of pause allowed for our own dehb-
eiations, and some time given to the angry pai ties
on the frontier to consider of their position, and
to right themselves, if, in a moment of heat,
eithei has fallen into enor This most desnable
end the memoiandum of Messis Forsyth and
Fox seems to have in view, and if received by the
Governors of Mame and New Brunswick in a
corresponding spnit, will leave the adjustment of
their differences to the dispassionate discussion
of the Governments of the United States and
Great Butain, to whom properly and exclusively
belongs the decision of the great question of war
or peace
Nothing could be more improper, in every point
of view, oi more to be deplored, than that a foi-
eign war should be superinduced by a precipitate
collision of coterminous authouties, superseding
the cautious deliberations of the gieat nations
whose destiny will be so deeply implicated in the
contest    The question of foieign war belongs to
this Government, and I beg leave to assure the hon-
orable Senator that, whenever the íníei est or honoi
of his State shall, in the opinion of this Govern
ment, make an appeal to aims necessary for their
vindication, I, and I believe the State of South
Carolina, will as ficely talco them up in her de
fense as if the affront or the injury had been suf
feted by ourselves      I know, sn, that the State
of Maine has been subjected to much, justly cal
culated to aggrieve and excite hei, and I cannot
forbear to add that, in my judgment, the negotia-
tions for hei lelief have not been urged with suf-
ficient earnestness, or hei rights insisted on in a
tone as peremptory as their unequivocal charac
ter fully justified     Hi i title to the disputed ter
ntory is unquestionable, and obtained, at the last
session,the unanimous sanction of this body, after
a most careful examination     This would have
authonzed the most decisive demands fiom our
Government on that of Gi eat Butain, and, if they
have not been urged, Mame may have cause of
complaint     But, as hei claims were the subject
of actual negotiation, and hei terutory, in regaid
to which that negotiation was pending, was sub
ject to provisional anangement by an understand-
ing between the Governments, it is certainly due
to this Government that it be consulted, if possi
ble, upon any matters affecting these relations,
or, if this was not deemed proper, I could have
wished, at all events, that it had been thought ad
visable by that State to have notified the British
authorities of the trespassof which she complains,
and of the mode in which she intended to correct
it.   This might have pioduced mutual explana I
tions, and perhaps cooperation in the coirection |
of the evil, or, if not, the Bntish authorities, by
their countenance of the maiaudeis, would have
been placed flagrantly in the wrong     That this j
was possible may, in some degree, be inferred |
from the prompt and high tone of the Bntish cor-
respondence, and from the preposterous assertion
of the claim to exclusive junsdiction over the dis
puted terutory
This unwanantable and most extraoidmary
assumption in regard to exclusive jurisdiction,
may perhaps itself furnish the grounds of a future
amicable adjustment of these differences Sir
John Harvey is clearly mistaken His Govern-
ment, it is to be hoped, will coriect his error, and
avow that he has misunderstood his orders The
Butish Government will not have the haidihood
to set up such a pretension and, as the military
operations of Sir John are founded on this mis
take, it is clearly the part of wisdom to pause
until his Government Las an oppoitunity to rec-
tify it.
However this may be, the recommendatory
convention before us is calculated to put the pai-
ties in the condition they occupied befoie the oc-
currence of those untoward events, to put the
rights of Mame again in the keeping of this Gov-
ernment, where the Constitution and the progress
of the negotiation deposited them, and, above all,
to leave upon the two Governments themselves
the high íesponsibihty of peace or war
I cannot, Mr President, refiain from com-
mending, in emphatic terms, the spirit of moder-
ation and fnmness which has charactenzed the
conduct oftheAdmimstiauon in the difficult emer-
gency upon which we have been thrown It has
my heaity appiobation, and I cannot but hope,
as I most aidently wish, that a policy commenced
undei such favorable auspices may eventuate in
the leestabhshment and consolidation of pacific
relations But if, unhappily, it should bo othei-
wise, why then I pledge myself to the Sena'oi
fiom Mame, and to the country, mat I will not
stop to count the cost when dut/ and putuotism
demand, as they then wi 1 demand, a solemn ap-
peal to the hst reason of nations
Mr DAVIS said I believe, Mi President, I
feel as much on this subject as the Senator from
South Gaiohna, who has justtxhoitedus to tem-
peiance, patience, and forbearance, till this ques-
tion shall be adjusted But I wish to call the
attention of the Senate for a moment to some
portions of the histoiy of this negotiation, that
we may see where we now stand. The propo-
sition for a mutual understanding was, that the
two parties should lemam as they were, and that
each should continue to hold jurisdiction and pos-
session of the disputed terntoiy just so far-as
they had aheady been obtained by the parties,
respectively And now, what is our attitude in
i egard to this whole business' I took some pains,
in the course of the discussion at the last session,
to examine this matter through, to see what was
the true condition of our diplomatic an angements,
and it will be found that this must be the result
of the whole That Great Britain, on her part,
has decisively refused to comply with a demand
foi a negotiation on the question as to where was
the boundary designated by the treaty of 1783.
The Government of the United States has again
and again uiged that certain marks, monuments,
and boundaues pointed out by that treaty were
to be ascertained, but she says the negotiation on
that topic is exhausted, and, though she is willing
to negotiate for a conventional line, she will not
negotiate in regard to the line of thattieaty Here-
the maiter rested, and Maine was consulted by
the United States Govemment, whether she was
willing to have the question settled by determin-
ing on a conventional line To this proposition
Maine gave a flat íefusal She would not, in any
case, consent to a conventional line, but she was
willing, in any way, to determine and settle the
line of the treaty The United States Government
now determined that, unless Maine would con-
sent, they had no power to negotiate further, be-
cause they had no power to negotiate away any
portion of Maine That is where the diplomatic
correspondence places it, as I then showed by
letteisofMi Vaughan, Mr Forsyth, and other
gentlemen concerned in the negotiation, and Mr.
Forsyth declared, in íegard to the negotiation,
that it was perfectly hopeless to renew it, because
the Bntish Government had again and again said
that they would not negotiate on the treaty of
1783, which was the only basis to which Maine
would agree, and whoever will examine the cor-
respondence will see that I am borne out in these
statements
Sir, I am not about to oppose this proposition,
or any piopositions which maybe presented of
a pacific character, and which aie meiely to bung
Maine and New Brunswick back to where they
stood But, withoutregaid to that pioposition, I
will proceed to one conclusion furthei Although
the plan now proposed may put off, for a time,
the evil day, although it may relieve our present
cmbariassments, and may place us for the time
out of the belligerent attitude, yet, I ask, what
is the piospect t iat we will bring this matter to
a close, and that we shall escape an ultimate col-
lision > Supposing the two countries now go
back to this conflicting junsdiction, and proceed
in the manner in which they have heretofore pro-
ceeded, as I have aheady said, the conflict there
grows directly out of this dispute about juris
diction Those conflicting jurisdictions run into
each othei, they have no ascei tamed boundaries
or limits, and hence it is that citizens of Maine
have again and again been arrested and diagged
into New Biunswick Ly hei civil authorities,
and theie convicted, pardoned, and sent back
Thiough all this it has happened that, whenevei
it was necessary to preserve the peace of the coun-
try, the United States Government has stepped
