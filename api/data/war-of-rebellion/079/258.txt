CLEVELAND, October 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER:

At General Thomas' request General Schofield will go to Chattanooga in the morning with the troops from here. The general directs me to say he desires you to order the troops at Ringgold and intermediate points to be in readiness to move at daylight to-morrow, and to fall back on Chattanooga if threatened by a superior force.

WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

CHATTANOOGA, October 13, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Have just heard you have returned from Dalton. Is it seriously threatened? Have about 3,000 troops here; do you advise me to send a force to Dalton?

G. D. WAGNER,

Brigadier-General.

CLEVELAND, October 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER:

I was not able to learn the strength of the force threatening Dalton, but presume it to be a pretty large cavalry force. I can hardly advise you, because I do not know the position of the main rebel army or your means of watching its movements. If Beauregard is moving toward Chattanooga, of course that place should not be weakened; if not, I would advise that troops be sent toward Dalton. At all events, a reconnaissance should be made from Ringgold and learn the facts. The force threatening Dalton to-day was coming from the west.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

First Brigade just leaving Athens by railroad; transportation here sufficient for the battery. I am urging forward the balance of the transportation. I shall remain here until the whole DIVISION is on the cars, and leave in the last train.
