THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 17,
$3,500. There are three places where he is
required to hold court in that State, and I
submit that $3,500 a year is not a sufficient
salary for a judge of a United States court.
Mr. HLA.. How often does he sit?
Mr. ROGERS. As often as the judge in
New Hampshire.
Mr. BLA. That is about one day in the
year.
Mr. ROGERS. There are terms of two or
three months, and he has to hold court at three
different places in the State. Three thousand
five hundred dollars a year is not sufficient
compensation for the labor which he is called
upon t.o perform. I do not care if the House
should make the sum $4,500 a year. If that
be the vote of the House I will submit to it
cheerfully; but I do submit that $3,500ayear
for an eminent jurist, a distinguished lawyer,
is not sufficient for his support, and is not
sufficient to give him freedom and independ-
ence, which every judge ought to have.
Mr. FAUNSWOHTH. What do the State
judges get?
Mr. ROGERS. The chief justice, $4,500 ;
associate justices, $4,000; and circuit judges,
$4,000, J. simply wish this thing placed on a
footing which will make the judiciary of this
country independent in the discharge of their
duty. I want to see them have sufficient
compensation and not compelled to "shin"
around town for money for the support of
themselves and their families. I do not think
$3,500 is enough. I think the compensation
ought to be $4,500. In many of the States
they get $4,000, and I do not wish to see the
distinction made against the United States.
Expenses of living are more in Arkansas
than in Pennsylvania, and it is not just to
f ive our judges less in Arkansas than the
judges receive in Pennsylvania.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. ARMSTRONG. I move to strike out
the paragraph, and in lieu thereof to insert
the following:
1'or salaries of the aovoraldistriot judges of the U ni-
tedStates in the Statesof Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky, the northern
district of Illinois, the eastern district of Missouri,
California, and the southern district of Ohio, $6,000
each.
In the States of Maine, Virginia, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, Tennessee, Indiana, Arkansas, $5,000 each.
In the States of llhode Island. Connecticut, New
Jersey, South Carolina, the northern district of Ohio,
Georgia, the southern district of Illinois, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and Oregon and Texas, $1,000 each.
In the States of New Hampshire, Vermont, Dela-
ware, North Carolina, West Virginia, Michigan,
Iowa, the western district of Missouri, Alabama,
Florida, and Kansas, Nebraska, and Nevada, $3,000
each.
Mr. Chairman, I desire to say that as be-
tween the various district courts of the United
States there is a great difference in the labor
performed. This classification which I pro-
pose has been prepared on a careful examina-
tion and comparison of the amount of business
before the judges in the several districts, and
on consultation with the Attorney General,
whom I understand to have approved of this
classification. The first class includes twelve
district judges, at $6,000 each, making $72,000.
The second class includes seven States, at
$5,000 each, making $35,000. The third in-
cludes thirteen judges, at $4,000 each, or
$52,000. The fourth includes fifteen judges;
at $3,500—which is the amount they now re-
ceive—making $52,500. The total amount
which will be appropriated by this hill under
the amendment would be $211,500. The sal-
aries of the judges, as they now stand under
the present law, would be for the same judges
$172,000; which is a total increase for all the
district judges of the United States of only
$39,500. And the redistribution, I may say
to the gentleman from New Hampshire, [Mr.
Ela,] does not affect his State at all.
I do not desire to prolong this argument;
but I submit to the House that the amount of
increased expense involved in this redistribu-
tion of salaries, which 1 contend is just and
necessary, is so small that it should not hesi-
tate to agree to it. I desire to have printed
with my remarks the tables to which I have
referred.
