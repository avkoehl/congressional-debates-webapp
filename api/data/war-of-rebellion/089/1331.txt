WILMINGTON, December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The Cape Fear goes to Fisher to-night. The Pelteway is down the river somewhere. She had better report to General Whiting, as the arrival of the Night Hawk here shows that the troops have been loaded, and I will not send the Sampson at present, but hold her here under General Bragg's orders, and not send more troops to Sugar Loaf until further orders, and to have steamers ready for service at a moment's warning.

JNumbers W. CAMERON,

Major, &amp; c.

GANDER HALL, December 27, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Major CAMERON,

Wilmington, N. C.:

Send light-draught steamer immediately to Fort Fisher, if not already done, to transfer troops to Caswell.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WILMINGTON, December 27, 1864.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The Pelteway not being here and the Flora being loaded, the only steamer I have got suitable for your purpose is the Sampson, which I sent at 9 o'clock to-night to Fort Anderson to transfer troops from there to Sugar Loaf. Use her and one or two of the decked flats now at Fisher to transfer troops to Caswell, and I will, within the next half hour, start the steamer North Carolina to take the Sampson's place. In moving the troops from Anderson, please give orders to have the Sampson returned from Caswell to Sugar Loaf as soon as possible, so that she may be on hand to lighter troops or freight in case I have any to send down.

JNumbers W. CAMERON,

Major and Chief Quartermaster.

WILMINGTON, December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have relieved the Badger and Night Hawk, blockade-runners, as I can get along with what transports we have should there be no heavier calls on me. Is my action approved by the general commanding, or does the anticipation of great calls for transportation make it necessary to retain them there?

JNumbers W. CAMERON,

Major, & c.
