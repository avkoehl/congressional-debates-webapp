Numbers 7. Reports of Major General George H. Thomas, U. S. Army, commanding Fourteenth Army Corps.

ON THE ROAD TO FAIRFIELD,

June 27, 1863-10 a.m. (Received 11.25 a.m.)

GENERAL: Generals Rousseau and Brannan have their advance at Fairfield. General Negley, with the train, is very nearly across to the road from Fairfield to Manchester. When shall the troops move to Manchester? Now, or will I await further orders? The enemy have made but feeble resistance this morning. I think General Sheridan had better move up to cover the passage of McCook's train, enabling my train to join my troops to-night. General Rousseau has just sent me word that the enemy passed the point where his advance now is two hours ago. The citizens report that they are going to Tullahoma. General Rousseau reports no enemy in sight.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,
