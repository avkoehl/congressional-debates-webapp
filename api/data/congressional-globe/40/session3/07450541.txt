SUFFRAGE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
Mr. STEWART. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Senate joint
resolution No. 8, proposing an amendment to
the Constitution of the United States. I do
not propose to press it to a vote to day, hut 1
wish the Senate to commence the consideration
of it, so that we can get through with it at an
early day.
The question being put, there "were, on a
divisionâ€”aves 18, noes 7 ; no quorum voting.
Mr. STEWART, i call for the yeas and
nays.
Mr. POMEROY. I have no objection to
proceeding at. a very early day to the consid-
eration of that resolution ; but I have an I
amendment which I intended to submit to it,
and 1 desired to submit it with some remarks
upon it. If the resolution is going to be pressed
to-day 1 shall not be prepared to do so.
Mr. STEWAIIT. I presume there will be
no definite action had to-day upon it. There
are amendments to be offered by several Sen-
ators. 1 merely desire to bring the subject
before the Senate.
Mr. POMEROY. To take up such a sub-
ject in the morning hour merely for remarks
is hardly customary.
Mr. STEWART. I want to fix a day for
its consideration.
Mr. TRUMBULL. We have upon the table
a great many bills that will take very little
time, and which ought to pass; some of them
of public importance. I have charge of.several
such, and if I could get the attention of the Sen-
ate for half an hour or an hour they could be
passed, and ought to be passed to promote the
public interests. I think there would bo no
objection to them if we could get the consid-
eration of the Senate to them; and the only
opportunity to consider thein is in the morn-
ing hour. Bills of a controverted character
have been under discussion which have taken
up all the time of tbe Senate. Now it is pro-
posed by the Senator from Nevada to call up
a proposition to amend the Constitution in
the morning hour. We shall just use up the
morning hour, and it will prevent the passage
of a good many bills that there would be no
objection to it'we could get attention to thein.
The constitutional amendment doubtless will
be more or less discussed, and we cannot get
through with it in the morning hour. Let it
come up at one o'clock some day and' have
the attention of the Senate, and let us then
hold 011 to it until we get action ; but it. seems
to me we shall accomplish nothing if we take
lip in the morning hour an important matter
of that kind, which unquestionably cannot
pass between now and one o'clock. I think
we had better go on with the ordinary busi-
ness ; and that is the reason why I have voted
against taking it up at this time. It is poor
econotnv ol' time.
Mr. STEWART. The session is drawing to
a close, and if there is to be action on this sub-
ject at this session it is very unpoi taut that it
should be at an early day. Since the resolution
was reported 1 have been trying to get the floor
every day to uige it forward; but it is utterly
impossible to get it up after the morning hour,
I want to call it to the attention of the Senate
particularly. I believe that there is a general I
concurrence that it should be passed at this
session. 1 do not think that it will involve long
discussion ; at all events, I do not propose to
make any protracted remarks, if any, on it. I
do not care to make any. It is an amendment
that is well understood. The principles upon
which it is based have been discussed at great
length at each session for several years, and it
is necessary to get action very soon. I under-
stand that on Monday next the chairman of
the Committee on Finance will occupy the time
of the Senate with business from that commit-
tee, and I do not know for how many days.
When that financial question is opened it may
last a long time; I cannot tell. There is other
business pressing, and I felt called upon this
morning to call this subject to the attention of
the Senate, and as it is very important 1 will
move to make it the special order for Thursday
next. I now desire to call it up for the pur-
pose of making that motion. If we can get to
it 011 Thursday next it will be making prog-
ress. Of course 1 cannot interfere with the
business of Monday next unless the chairman
of the Committee on Finance will give way 011
that day. 1 now ask that the resolution be
taken np, with the view ot making it the special
order for Thursday.
Mr. CONKL1N G. I do not. see why this
proposition may not be voted upon in the
morning hour.without fixing a future day and
without,deferring other business. It relates to
a very important subject, upon which there has
been, and there might still be, indefinite de-
bate ; but, debate upon it would naturally be
conducted for the purpose of influencing those
here who are to listen to the debate. As no
canvass proceeds iu the country now, the
temptation would seem to be slight to debate
