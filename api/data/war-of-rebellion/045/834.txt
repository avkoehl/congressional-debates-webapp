HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS, August 2, 1863-12. 15 p. m.

Major-general Humphreys,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I telegraph the following, just received, fifteen minutes later than my last:

General Newton: I apprehend no attack. The rebel cavalry is very active. Their picket line is unusually strong, brought on probably by my movements. Their signal officers are busy. I feel secure.

Buford.

Major-general, Commanding.

RAPPAHANNOCK STATION, August 3, 1863.

Brigadier-general Warren,

Chief Engineer:

General: I am informed that al the troops have recrossed at Kelly's Ford excepting 6 men, who have been left as a guard for the bridge. Cannot we have an order making the commanding officer at or near the bridge responsible for its defense?

G. H. Mendell.

Captain of Engineers.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS, August 3, 1863.

Major-general Humphreys,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

General: About 10 a. m. I received a signal telegraph from Buford's signal officer, on outpost about 3 miles from bridge, that the enemy were advancing in large force (all arms). Since that, General Buford writes that he thinks it was an exaggeration; he finds nothing but cavalry pickets. I have received telegram from headquarters in regard to the falling back of enemy's wagon train. The breaking up of their camps does not indicate in what direction they are moving, neither does sending back their wagon train. In this state of doubt, I hold myself in a state of readiness for anything that may occur. The work on railroad bridge is progressing rapidly, and will, no doubt, soon be completed.

John Newton,

Major-general, Commanding.
