Believing alt this, sir I look with anxiety and alarm to the

Mr W COST JOHNSON said that he did not rise for the

spoken duung ihe extra session, or this upon the various finan
cidl schemes had an oppoitumiy o! giving their views, as he
knew mat there were many who were anxious to discuss the
siibjec His purpo e was to urge upon the m tjonty who had

al lUnk man it le, chartered upon safe and salutary prmci
pie-  and it «asa sevcie lelkction on Oongre^s, if it had not
wisdom enough to frame a charter that would pi event a Bank
from being an instrument of evil, and the sagacity of Congress
was limited, indeed if it tould not frame one to be in mstitu
tion for salutary and beneficial purposes It was narrow rea
sonmg to argue against any institution that in possibility it
might do evil The sdme reasoning might be urged to abolish
Congress, fot Congress may do evil "" It may levy onerous
taxes, yet would yoa for that reason, take from it the power
to levy t^xesl A degree of confidence as well asa degiee of
discretion must be tolerated, or all human institutions must be
abolished Bad as human nature is, he believed that its good
tiaits prepondeiated over us evil propensities
He would not discuss the subject of a fixed policy of finance
a  this time
1 here was butone bank m his district, us capital did not, he
be icved, exceed one hundred thousand dollars It was well
conducto 1, and he never heard any individual complain of
either its officers oi its mode of doing business He thought
banksnecessary, and would be the last to wage a general and
indiscuminae War against them He would perhaps take
some more suitable occasion, at least one moie congenial with
his feelings to trespass upon the time of the House His ob
jece was to uige an adjournment
The committee must well remember the expectation
aw akened by the chairman of the financial committee, when he
moved, upon one occasion, to lay aside the duelling report m
order to take up this Tieasury note bill, that he stated that
there would be a full discussion upoH it Can it have been
forgotten that, in making his long and elaborate opening
speech, but yesterday, he boldly threw the gauntlet of defiance,
and fu"y challenged debate upon the financial schemes of the
Executive, in which he has so largely participated"* After all
tin-, gallantdisplay will you -hriok from scrutiny?
rh" h norable cliairm^r has been adroit and skilful An ap
propnation bill was hurried through, but asnort time ago, np
on the ground that the public exigencies required its immidi
ate pascase It slumbered long in the (Senate, and why! Jte
cause, as was admitted there was no money in the Treasu y
Now this hill, which should have preceded that, was kept 11 its
rear, because foi ooih you must now cirry this through by
storm to give the other effect And thus bills which lavish or
create mi lions are tobe smuggled through both Houses and
b th Houses are to be muzzled, and ifa member has theau li
city to question then wisdt n he is t > he denounced II >uch
things afp -olerated, the ddjs of dictat irship and passive obe-h
ence arelruly at hand
You mistake the people if you suppos  that they will rcn
sure those who a^k and demand a full mves igation of thefi n
cial policy of the Government They will censure and disti ust
those who slu ink from it There is no law of human na ire

Hon the most remote and hidden fib^s of society andeveiy
in in n the ndtioi has felt the ptessme, and looks to Congress
for some mode of amelioration—some geneiat system ol re
dress They no not want to see i Treasury bank to com hr^e
notes which they nevei see, much less possess, nor Sub Trea
suries, with their swaims of receivers general ai cl such diem
taries, who are to fatten on the hard earnings oí the plain, un
pretending, and industrious
The) do not desue to see the Government separateil from the
p ep e, and the public servants made proudly supeiiorto their
ma. crs He knows but little of tne human heart who believes
the people will tolerate it with complacency nefhas wrongly
s udied the American character if he believes that the people
of tins nation will endure it
Mi J was anxious to see the committee rise, and report pro-
gress, and have the amendments pending printed He was de
s roue to see a vole t ken upon each amendment proposed
Out he felt fully assured in saytng thdt if the committee re
parted the bill to the House thdt night, without having leave to
sltaeam no vo e would betaken on the amendments the same
vote that ould refuse an adjou oment would sustain the pre
vious question It was, he expecte ', in tha recol'ection of
many members of the committee that, duung the extra session,
he hdd moved an amendment to the Treasurv note bill late one
night about 12 o clock to limit the time of issuing Treasury
notes, he supported it, with his íeasons for offering it Upon
the vote on his amendment h waslost in the committee bysix
votes, upon a division The next day a ¡rentleman from New
Yoik, now in his eye, [Mr Brinson ] picked up his amend
nient n theHous , and offered it, and it passed almost unam
mously Then on niaht' meditation or sleep eñected a won
deifulchdnge [Mr Ba i\son said n was true he had offered
the amendment of the gentleman fiom Maryland, but he had
"iv en nuce, in Committee of the \\ hole, that he should do so }
° Mr Johvson sai 1 that he did not allu le to u in unkmdness,
and was not annoyed in the least that his name did not appear
on the lottrnal U was for a different purpose that he alluded
to it He would say however, that he had also given notice
that he woula renew his motion he had been urged hy the veiy
gentleman to do so which that gentleman must recoiled, unless
re his a lapse of memo,y He had in the House repeatedly
tried to gain the fl >or for that purpose, but the Speaker's eyes
but seldom cheered the dark side of the House where his seat
The ffentleman from New York no doubt thought, with many
ofhsfnend , hat all that thev had promised wouldbe lealized
1 h it the issue ol the ten millions, authorized by the extra ses
=lon wouid relieve the Treasury and the people, and that there
woul I be no repetition of the lequest for another issue of ten
m l'ion  that that issue would be the first and the last In this
expectation lie thought, at tht time, the honorable member
wou'd be disappointed He hdd no doubt at that time that the
gsntleman from New York would be lound like Shaksp-are's
woodcock, 'caught in his own spi mg " that he would be forced
to vo e against the amendmentof which he made himselfthepu
taitve a ithoi
Mr J's purpose was widely different in moving that amend
mem in the committee He saw, or thought he saw, a power
beh nd the throne, half veiled, half disclosed, that looked with
anxious eye and open hand at the trembling sceptre, an 1 anxious
to seize it, and, to achieve such a purpose, was desirous to t-uil I
up a vast Exe-utivc paper bank on the mms of the late ion«t i
h ink to build up a vast political machine, Lo toned on a conso
lid ted Lxecmive issue ves, sir, a mi nster more hideous than
any tf be lead oi in prophets' vision
\?Vh<.the hadled lin theo her end of ihe Capí ol after what
he read in the report of t> e «erretary of the Trea« iry a' the
commencement of this session, he was convinced that his aily
impressions we-e correct The Secretary asks, upon contm
gencies and emergencies, to b  allowed to extend the issues
Such is tlie cautious language, he to be the sole judge The
plain English of all is to give him the power to judge of the
amount, time, and circumstances, togradually and progressively
establish an Executive bank to issue a new sort i,f continental
paper money
It was toavoid such a national calamity that he-was induced to
urge the amendment he did
In further proof, it was not until yesteiday that the cbairman
moved an amendment, limiting the time for the proposed issue
L was not until he discovered that, without it, his bill would fall
It was then he adopted Sancho's philosophy, that half aloaf was
better than no bread, and concluded to do himself, with good
grace, what he would be forced to submit to
Of all the national calamities he would most deplore the one
which he would most strive against would be to see the who e
power over money, exchange, State banks, and commerce,
swallowed upanddevouied by the monster of an Executive
bank And this vast machine in the hands of the most know
mg—Mr Levi Woodbury
Why, Mr Chairman, if j ou were to give him ihe power to
establish a paper mill and a reservoir of ink by the side of his
office, to make paper money at will, he would then have to call
on Congress every year to enlarge his discreuon and power
Mr J had no confidence in his Treasury notes, his Treasury
circulars, his specie circulars, nor his Treasury orders, they
change as quick as the chamehon, and are as vacillating a= the
wind His folly has brought the indigent to rum and ¡he
wealthy toward, and yet we are called on to trust totals most
sapient counsellor
Here Mr Iohnson gave way to Mr Chambers, who Blovcd
that the committee should rise ayes S9, noes 89
The Chair announced that the majority have it There w-s
a great noise and confusion Some voice asked the Chair if
it had voted! He said no Tt-e Chaib then voted in the uega
tive
Mr J was about resuming, when Mr Robertson rose to a
point of order Mr R s<i!d that after the ( hair had dec ided
the motion to adjourn, it could not vote There was too much
cor fusion  hear
Mr Curtis, Mr Duncan, Mr Adams, and Mr Eober^soi
spoke There were many cries of question, and the Chair
was propounding the question, if the committee would rise,
when
Mr Johxson again rose and said that he demanded to know
if he was not entitled to the floor, as he had only 5 lelded it to
a privileged ques'ion
The Chair said he had a right to proceed    (Great noise )
Mr I said that he believed that the chairman was a member
of the Naval Committee, and would most respectfully ask him
if he had ever ascended from the Chesapeake the Potomac
which from the Indian, means the river of swans, in one of
Fulton's mag ufitent steamboats    Tne prosp-ct is beautiful
you see not only one of the most beauttlul streams in the
world, but the scenery is picturesque and delmhtful    When on
deck you perceive a most strange optical delusion   a promor
tory of land projecting far into ihe river, and reaching almost
on tlip opposite bank to an acute point    You wondei how a
steamer can pass 11   but, res you nedr it, you find ims seeming
acute angle rounding gradually and most giaceiiilly, and redil /
exhibiting no point at all    This promontoi), like the point
started, -but not raised, by your decision is calle 1, by mariners,
Potnt No Point    We have, said Mr J   on th* Potomac as
many curious points as those started, ind as often strangely
decided, 10 this House    In the language of the rlvei melody,
there is
Point Look Out,
Point íook Ioi
Point No Potnt,
And Point Agin
Tha  you have deoided that we have Just had patM no pmn<
when we shall b&vepoint again, was not for him to determine
He would say, however, that he had no doubt that the gentk
man from Virginia was correet, and the Chair was wrong  hut
he would yield to (he decision of the Chair, ashc hadoften per
ceived that there were gentlemen w ho were under the influence,
occasionally, of either optical or mental delusions, and would
leave it to others to decide, amid the noise and the glimmeur g
lights of this Hall, which may have influenced the Chair h
others    But this was not germam to the subject, or 'o his
purpose
He would ask the committee, in all candor, if it was wi e to
legis'a'e amid the restive and anxious feeling which has bei n
so often manifested' Wasitnotdue ticommon c uitesv for
the majority to yield to the urgent feelings 01 ihe minority!—a
majority nof only strong innumter, but powerful m talent—1
minority that could susfend all action of the committee try re
tiring, and destroying thereby a quorum He would notadvise
the minority to retire, but he would say that when the hom hand
and the minuiehand jo ned at the figure twelve he would retire
to his chamber He would not join further m the con est, to
see if we could wear out tne polmcal or theptiyHd! cunsiitu
«on the fastest He would m t spend the Sabbath in inquiring if
Government paper money was a curse or anati nal blessing
His reading and reflections of the past had mlormed him thdt
Government issues of paper had alwajs resulted in lrjunous
consequences The Royal Bank of France, the Government
paper issues of Austria and Russia, all proved it The his ory

«ravequestions, which have sjch lmrner e c oseqoences1 m
Their result To doubt, is to be accused o' us¡ ccnunworthj,

He would ask, in candor if there was not too much of pain

For one he grieved at ihesirong fanaticism of party which had
so long existed m this country    No public man who was net
ultra on the one side or the other, could receive the confidente
of any large portion of the people    For himself, he cared 1 01
for political results, and would freely aiow that he alwav,
