Defalcation of Samuel Sivarlwout—Mr. Thomas.
Ho. of Reps.
ministration is held responsible for the loss* of this
money, it ought, on that account, to have the
means furnished to ascertain who has it, and how
much of it can be recovered The documents be-
fore us show that a very large proportion of the
money embezzled by S «artwout, with whom Price
>s piobably connected, was denved from collec-
tions said to be made from the merchants of New
Yt rk m the first and second quarteis of the y tar
18^7 The question naturally arise?, was all th s
money actually paid ' Were thete any compro
mises between the collector and the merchants, by
which their bonds were discharged, by any means
except by the actual payment of the whole amount
of the money due' I know nothing of the mer-
chants conceined I know not whether there is
one single man amongst them capable oí collu-
sion with the collector to deprive the Government
of its just due My respecta for human nature
foibids me to believe that there has not been a
holla fije payment on the part of these merchants
of every doller due upon then bonds, as stated by
Swartwout.
But, in oidenng this examination, the House
must proceed upon the supposition that all of the
money for which Swaitwuut is in default lias not
been used by him alone And in looking to as-
ceitam whethei otheis aie concerned, it is most
nuturat that we should turn our attention to those
with whom we know the defaultei was intimate
and had moneyed transactions to a large extent
Taking this view, then, of this matter, adverting
to the point to which the investigations of the com
mittee aie naturally to be directed, I appeal to
gentlemen on this floor who piofess to be fnendly
to the AdmiMi.trai.ion—1 appeal especially to the
gentlemen from Virginia, to whom 1 have already
taken the liberty to addiess myself, and ask why
should the usual mode of appointing committees
be departed from' Why should the examination
not be conducted by the friends of the Adminis-
tration, to be held íesponsible for the loss of pub-
lic piopeity > I repeat, the conductof the officers
of the Treasury is not to be inquued into in con
nection with the New Yoik defalcation We
have copies of the íecoids fiom the Uepaitment
exhibiting their connection with this tiansaction
Those extiacts exhibit the whule case, except in
that pal titular featuu of it which directs the mind
to those pnvate citizens wtio may have had deal
ings with kwaitwotit It cannot be pietended
that the fi lends of the Administration in private
life are most piobably involved in this stuptnd
ous fiaud, and, therefoie, a majority of thatpaity
oufjht not to be chosen to piostcute this proposed
scrutiny J he piobabilmes are all on the other
bide Swartwout did not vote for the piesent
Chief Magistrate He has long cheiished towards
him feelings of decided hostility He enjoyed, we
all know, about the time most of this money was
embezzled, the confidence of the Whig and Con-
sérvate e merchants generally of New 1 ork His
intimate associations must have been chiefly with
those political classes Among them, then, I
repeat, we should look for information to enable
us to discover to whom and how this money has
been disposed of Without intending to intimate
thatany discoveries will be made—in fact, I believe
little will be learned that we do not now know—i
insist that the sciutimes of this committee must
have a dnection that justifies an adherence to the
customary mode in its selection But, if this
mode is now to be departed fiom, let us net have
a choice made in the darn If one known to the
public, responsible for his acts, is not to name
this committee, then, sir, let us proceed in a way
to know where, upon whom, the responsibility is
to lest Before 1 sit down, I shall propose to
strike out the words " by ballot," in the amend
ment of the gentleman from Virginia, and insert
in lieu of them the words " vita voce " If this
proposition should prevail, the public will be
guarded against many evils which will be inevit-
able if the practice of electing committees by ballot
shall ever prevail in this House
Befoie I take my seat, I desire to comment
briefly upon one or two topics introduced into
this discussion An attempt has been made to
throw upon ti e piesent and the last Administra-
tions lesponsibihty for the defalcation of which I
have been speaking     A few well known facta
will place that matter in its true position before
the public The present Chief Magis'rate did not
appoint Mr Swartwout He never had confi-
dence in him But gentlemen may say, why did
he not remove him ' Is there any one who will
deny but that Mi. Van Buren would ha/e been
most ruthlessly denounced, if, upon coming into
the Presidency, he had forthwith removed tbecol-
ie< tor of New York, who had been appointed in
1834, at the instance of the moot respectable mer-
chants of NewYoik, and who enjoyed, in the
spring of 1837, the entire confidence of the whole
mercantile community where his dutiesweieto be
performed' If he had been removed under such
circumstances, the Piesident would have been
lampooned and vilified from all quarters, by the
Opposition, foi having, as it would havebeen said,
turned out a faithful and popular public officer,
simply because he had not yoted for the present
Chief Magistrate at the election of 1836 Bat it
will be said the Administration is to be censuied
for failing to discover these defalcations at an
earlier day To this chaige I have not an oppoi-
tunity now fully to lespond Whether tlere hai>
been too much confidence placed m the late col
lector at New Yoik by some of the ofhi eis of the
Treasuiy Depaitment, I will not now undeitake
to discuss If gentlemen will examine the whole
subject without prejudice, they will find that the
legislative branch of the Government has much
to answer foi in the premises Under the old de-
posit system, collectois and othei public agents
had too easy an access to the public money To
this conclusion the public mmd is rapidly tending,
and it is to be hoped that Congiess will, before
we adjourn, take caie to throw new guards aiound
the public treasure That the laws are now such
as to have afforded opportunities to the New York
collector to escape detection, nomattei howseaich-
ingbad been the examinations made into hiatians-
aouons, can be shown without difficulty But I
shall not now go into that branch of the discus-
sion I shall content myself for the present by
showing that Swartwout eluded the vigilance of
distinguished men whose duty it was to examine
into the matte , to whose capacity for high office,
integrity, and patnotism, the whole Opposition
in this Hou&e will cheerfully bear testimony And
when I have shown this, 1 shall claim that the de-
nunciations uttered here, in the coaise t style,
against the Admimstiation,aie levelling, fiom the
giossness of their injustice
In March, 1834, Mr Swartwout was nomin-
ated foi reippouitment At that time rumors were
ufloat prejudicial to his character as a public i fficei
He had, nevertheless, the recommendations of most
of the i espectable Whig merchants of the city of
New York The suspicions which had been ex-
cited found then way into the Senate Chamber be-
fore his nomination had been acted on An inves-
tigation into then ti Uih was had in that body We
have no means to decide with entire cettainty who
conducted that examination We know, however,
that it is the piactice of the Senate, when in secret
sessions, to refei nominations of collectois of cus
toms to the Committee on Finance We know
that at that session of Congiess, Mr Webster,
Mr Tyler, Mr Mangum, Mr Ewmg, and Mr
Wilkins, four opponents and only one friend of
the Administration, composed the Finance Com-
mittee To these gentlemen, then, we have au-
thority for saying the Senate referred the nomina-
tion of Mr Swartwout It became their duty to
mqune into the truth or falsehood of the suspicions
afloat, that the nominee had accounted for all the
public money received by him That committee
had access to all the laws and regulations of the
Treasury, and to all the returns made by Swart
wout to the Treasury Department, to which the
officers of the Treasury had access, to enable them
to detect defalcation Notwithstanding, no defal-
cation was discovered, although it now appeirs
thatSwartwout's peculations commenced in 1830,
and were, m 1834, when his nomination was
confirmed by a Whig Senate, then very large in
amount *   These things ought to teach gentlemen
*Itwill be seen that Mr Thomas made the above
remaiks undei an impress on that nominations of
the collectors of customs ueie uniformly, in secret ,
session in the Senate, referred to the Committee on |
moderation and decency of language, when d.s-
coursing upon the conductof those who have tha
laws to execute They should teach more than
that—they should lead us to suspect that there ii
fault in the laws, since a public defaultei could so
effec'ually elude detection, notwithstanding hi"?
condi ct was strictly inquired into, and we should
set about correcting this evil at i*s source, by new
guards to secuie ti e public treasure.
Besides this, there aie other things to be learned
from the facts to which I have refeired The
most unmeasured abuse has been heaped upon
the present and last Administrations, and upon
the whole party by which they were supported
We have listened day after day (said Mr T)
to the charge that the whole are corrupt Sn, I
must say that such a charge is a slander, no
matter from what quarter it may come And 1
know too, that my words will be responded to
by the great mass of the people, of all political
complexions However men may d ffer as to
the manner in which our Government shall be
admimsteiul, they will not believe, they do not
believe, that base motives influence any respect-
able poition of that immense mass composing the
Administration ard l's supporters But upon
what evidence is this chaige of geneial, univeisal
conuption founded' A public officer here and
there, it is discovered, has embezzled public
money To a libeial mind, to a man having
some little confidence in the integiity of human
nature, such occurrences would lead to the charge
of negligence, inattention on the pait of those
whose duty it was to guard against defaults But
a different course is adopted, and bad motives
are, in all cases, imputed How are gentlemen
to be circumstanced, if this rule weie applied to
them in the case of Swartwout' Under the last
Administration he was appointed to office He
was not removed foithwith by the present Ad-
ministration And gentlemen, upon this stale of
the facts, say both these Administiations aie cor-
rupt Well, sn, what then would be the condi-
tion of the Conservative and Whig parties' A
Whig Senate committee examined into the con-
duct of Swaitwout, as collectoi, and approved it
in 1834 Whig merchants of New Yoik, well
aequunted with him, recommended him for ap-
pointment at the same period, and a Whig Senate
confiimed it In January, 1837, after this man
had steeped himself in peculations, but before
that was known to the public, he was a vice pres-
ident of a Conseivative meeting m New York,
the proceedn gs of which I now hold in my hand.
Vast numbeis of copies of these proceedings were
published at the time, and forwarded to their
constituents by Whig and Conservative members
of the House. In Maich, 1837, 'he same man
piesided at a meeting to nominate a candidate for
mayoi of New York, to be supported by the Con-
servatives, who were not ready openly to join the
Opposition In July, of the same year, he signed
the celebrated letter to Mr. Tallmadge, approving
his political couise, and, in the same month, was
chairman of a meeting of the fnends of the credit
system and opponents of an Independent Treas-
ury, held at the National Hall, in the city of New
Yoik In all these various capacities, for all these
acts, Swartwout was epplauded, countenanced,
and encouiaged, by the whole Opposition He was
their political associate. Nevertheless, he was
then a defaulter He had large amounts of the
public money fraudulently m his possession, and
used, doubtless, large sums of it to punt and cn-
culate the documents to which I have refened,
to teach, in the language of them, sound public
and private morals to the American people
Finance In this he afterwards discovered there
was a mistake Nominations of that character
go to the Committee on Commerce, and not to the
Committee on Finance Messrs Silsbee, King,
of Alabama, Wright, Waggaman, and Spiague,
composed the Committee on Commerce of the Sen-
ate, when the nomination of Swartwout for re-
appointment was made. These gentlemen, thieg
of whom were Whigs, were imposed upon by
Swartwout They were led to believe that his ac-
counts were correct, and his nomination was ap-
proved by them, and finally ratified unanimously
by the Senate.
