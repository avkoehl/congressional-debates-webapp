which is the marketable value of the product;
and when they attempt to do so for any length
of time they bring on financial ruin.
It may be roughly estimated, according to
the capital stock represented in them, that
each continuous line of railway running from
the Atlantic to the foot of Lake Brie has cost
$100,000,000, and the common experience is
that a railway, including al! its appurtenances,
weai'S-out its capital once in ten years, which
implie's that ten per cent, of its capital must
be made from its business every year to keep
it up; and, in addition, ten per cent, more
must be made for casualties, lawsuits, and
dividends, making $20,000,000 on the capital
invested. The gradient of a railroad has much
to do with the cost of running it and keeping
the rolling-stock in repair. There are heavy
grades on all the great through lines, to wit:
the highest grade on the Pennsylvania Central
is ninety-five feet to the mile ; on the Erie,
ninety feet; New York Central, eighty feet:
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, one hun-
dred and sixteen feet; and the Chesapeake
and Ohio, seventy-five feet. On the latter the
grade is to be reduced to sixty feet. It may
be laid down broadly, as a rule, that water
transportation never exceeds one cent per
ton per mile, and should not cost over half a
cent.
The general question that is asked is whether
canals will pay, and this question is best an-
swered by showing what has been done by the
Erie canal. In the report of engineers and
surveyor of the Now York canals for 1868,
pages 12 and 13, it is shown that the tolls and
other receipts of the Erie and Champlain
canals, up to the 30th of September, 1861, paid
the cost of their construction, enlargement,
extension, and improvement, and interest
thereon at the rate of seven per cent, per an-
num, and the cost of repairs and incidental
expenses up to that date, and left besides a
net profit to the State of $38,455,560; which
shows pretty conclusively that the capital put
into the enterprise was a good investment,
simply in a business point of view. The same
report furnishes the information that twenty-
nine thirtieths of.the large amount, over $7£>,-
000,000, was derived from tolls levied on
commerce going to and coming from the coun-
try situated to the west of Lake Erie. According
to the report of the auditor of the canal depart-
ment, in 1868, the canals transported 6,442,225
tons of freight, nineteen twentieths of which was
carried by the Erie canal, and less than one
thirtieth of this freight was the product of the
State of New York. In the report of the
auditor, for 1871, it is shown that the net earn-
ing of these canals from September 30, 1861,
to the close of September, 1871, amounted to
the sum of $32,970,269 ; also, that the surplus
revenues of the canals of the State, from 1836
to 1871, inclusive, amounted to $72,424,797.
This disposes pretty effectively of the question
as to whether a well-constructed and well-
managed canal pays or not.
In maintaining our flag on the Pacific ocean,
and achieving our rightful share of commerce
offered by the countries south of us, continu-
ous water communication from the Ohio is
most essential. China, with her four hundred
million people, has already opened commer-
cial relations with us across the widest ocean
of the world. We now steam right away over
six thousand miles of sunny water, to the
open ports of Japau, there to harvest the rich
resources of that wonderful land and still
more marvelous people.
In relation to the magnitude and value of
the exports and imports of a few articles
which enter into our commerce with the Gov-
ernments south of the United States, I beg to
refer to the following tables:
