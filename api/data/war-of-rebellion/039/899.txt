imated by great enthusiasm, and were pressing forward through the tangled undergrowth, with the hope of being able to capture the battery. The battery, however, ceased its fire as we got in the more open woods near the Plank road, and I believe, drove off out of our reach. When we reached the road, the regiments were reformed, and, in a short time the brigade was moved down the Plank road by the left flank, my regiment being in the advance. We had not moved far before there was picket firing to the right of the road, and immediately afterward a regiment of friends, in the woods to theleft of the road, fired into us. Artillery with their caissons were in the road abreast of us, and some, without drivers, ran headlong into my regiment, creating temporary confusion. Quiet was soon restored, and we again moved down the road by the left flank.

In a short time Colonel [Francis] Mallory, commanding the regiment, was ordered to deploy it to the right of the road, as skirmishers. The left wing of the regiment had filed but a short distance into the woods when they came upon the enemy's skirmishers, with line of battle immediately in their rear. They replied to inquiries made by Major [A. D.] Saunders that they were friends, and while he was endeavoring to ascertain who they were, they opened a destructive fire upon us. The fire was returned with spirit. Several of the enemy were captured and others were killed and wounded. Before more than half of the regiment had filed out of the road, and during this infantry fire, we were opened upon by an enfilanding fire of artillery in the road. Colonel Mallory and myself endeavored to throw forward the right wing, so as to get rid of this destructive flank fire, but found it impossible to do so them, from the nature of the ground and the peculiar situation of the troops. Colonel Mallory then endeavored to protect the men by forming them in the slight excavation by the side of the Plank road. He was killed at this point, and I was slightly, though for a time painfully, wounded. Major Saunders then assumed command.

On Sunday morning the regiment was again engaged, in which action Major Saunders and Captain [George W.] Street were killed, and all the captains then with the regiment were wounded. Adjutant [R. L.] Williams then assumed command, being the senior officer then present. Major [Evan] Rice joined the regiment the next day, and was in command during its subsequent operations.

Our loss during these battles was 120 killed and wounded.* Among the killed we have to mourn the loss of some of our most gallant officers and bravet men. Colonel Mallory, Major Saunders, Captain [George W.] Street, and Lieutenant [R. L.] Fleet were killed. Captains [R. B.] Fauntleroy, [John H.] Fleet, [Albert] Rennoldsl, [A.] Brockenbrough, and [C. T.] Goolrick were wounded; Captain [William J.] Davis, captured. Lieutenants [L. D.] Roane, [W. J.] Duff, [William A.] Street, [J. T.] Boughan, [J. H.] Tupman, [P. C.] Waring, [J. R.] Lumpkin, [W. A.] Elliott, [Samuel] Downing, and [J. E.] Bullock were wounded. These officers all behaved gallantly, as did others also who were not wounded. The loss of our gallant colonel, who has been with us since the organization of our regiment, is deeply felt and mourned by us all.

Respectfully submitted.

WM. S. CHRISTIAN,

Liuet. Colonel Fifty-fifth Virginia Regiment, Commanding.
