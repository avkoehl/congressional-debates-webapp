General, if it be possible do urge the commanding general to give us some additional force and let us advance in to it; now is the time. and such a people as are those who live in East Tennessee deserve and should be relieved and protected. You know the importance of this move and will I hope use all your influence to effect it. Our men will go forward with a shout to relieve their native land.

The brigade commissary has not yet handed in his report of the amount of provisions on hand; but I think we have already nearly if not quite a month's supply on hand.

With much respect, I am, dear general, yours, very truly,

S. P. CARTER,

Acting Brigadier-General, Commanding East Tennessee Brigade.

General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding, &c., Crab Orchard.

GENERAL: * * * Recruits are arriving almost every day from East Tennessee. We have no arms to put into their hands. The Union men coming to us represent the people in East Tennessee as waiting with the utmost anxiety the arrival of the Federal forces. They are all ready to join them and do their part toward the deliverance of their native land. Union camps are already forming in some of the counties and unless help soon reaches them as they have but little ammunition they will be scattered or destroyed.

Wit the hope of soon seeing you here, respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. CARTER,

Acting Brigadier-General, Commanding.
