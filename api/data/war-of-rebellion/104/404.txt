A party of guerrillas is lurking around between this place and Starke's Wharf. They were at Bayou Minette brigade last night. I think some cavalry should be left here to scount for this company. It will be necessary to keep a guard at the brigade if if is rebuilt.

The company of First Louisiana Cavalry has but about twenty men for duty, and they are the only orderlies I have at my headquarters. General Canby directed me to retain them. It is not strong enough to do the necessary scouting.
