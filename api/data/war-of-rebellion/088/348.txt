Lieutenant Colonel C. H. MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Second Army Corps:

COLONEL: The reports from my pickets this morning are to effect that there is an appearance of small parties of rebels on the New Market road beyond its intersection with the Charles City road and on several of the roads north of the Charles City road. At several places they have been seen removing barricades on those roads north of the Charles City road. The vedettes at Deep Run report a movement of a force of perhaps two regiments across the front toward our right. Timely notice will be had of any advance. If this should be made, it would be better met by a force thrown a little farther out on the hill to the right of General Birney's present position.

Yours, respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.
