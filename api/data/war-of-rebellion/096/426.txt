HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865-6.15 p.m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

De Trobriand is moving to Vaughan road at crossing of Hatcher's Run; he is 2,500 strong. West's brigade will follow him; it is about 1,000 strong. I will get some from Smyth. I have ordered Miles to send a brigade as quickly as possible.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

HATCHER'S RUN, February 6, 1865.

General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

Let General De Trobriand connect with Ayres at Armstrong's Mill. Let him communicate with Ayres at that point. All is doing well here. All apparently over. Look to Armstrong's Mill and keep your troops in readiness there.

A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865.

Major-General WEBB:

Your dispatch relative to De Trobriand connecting with Ayres received, and staff officer sent to De Trobriand accordingly. De Trobriand must now be at crossing of Hatcher's Run by Vaughan road. Colonel Michler has gone with my staff officer. He will see you. Perhaps it may be thought better for De Trobriand to go up on the opposite bank of Hatcher's Run.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Do you want West's brigade? Upon receipt of your last order about De Trobriand, I halted West, and have directed him to be held in reserve, on McAllister's left, ready to be sent to Armstrong's Mill, or to you, as may be wanted. Shall I countermand the order sent to Miles, to send out a brigade to you? General Smyth reports to me that the right of Warren's troops are in their rifle-pits in connection with his at Armstrong's Mill. He has strengthened that point.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:
