Answer. I led off my column. We ran up into some little thick pine bushes. We halted there. The next order I got was to move back again. Some one reported that we could not get through. I made no reconnaissance whatever myself.

Question. What road did General Sturgis, with General Piatt's brigade, take from Manassas, when that general inquired of you what road General Sykes had taken?

Answer. They followed immediately in the rear of the brigade that I commanded.

Question. Why did you not follow General Sykes, if such were your orders?

Answer. That morning, before leaving the position we had occupied all night, I was directed to bring up the rear. I threw out pickets of my brigade, and relieved all the others, and after the other commands were in motion, as reported to me by General Morell, I recalled my pickets, and got in motion as soon as possible. The other commands must have had a half an hour the start of me. We never overtook them at all; never got in sight of them.

Question. did you, or not, hear General Porter, at any time during the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th of August, criticize General Pope's military conduct, or his capacity for generalship, unfavorably? If so, will you state the substance of such criticism?

Answer. I never did. I never heard him, to my recollection, mention General Pope's name but once. On the 29th of August, General Porter said, "My orders are very conflicting. I first receive them from this officer, and then from that officer; officers whom I do not know and have never seen, and they are brought to me by orderlies. I have written General Pope a note, requesting of him hereafter to send all his orders to me in writing." That is the only time that I recollect of ever hearing General Porter mention General Pope's name. As I have stated before, when he read that communication to his generals, he stated that it was from General Pope. In reference to any transactions between himself and General Pope, I never heard him speak of him but that once, at the time I have mentioned.
