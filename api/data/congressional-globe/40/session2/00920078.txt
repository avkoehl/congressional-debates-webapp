Ansioer. The department of Washington

land, and Delaware, excluding Fort Delaware.
Question. Stateaswellasyou can ; ifyoucan-
not give it all, give the substance of that con-
versation which you had with the President
when you first entered upon command?
Answer. It is impossible for me to give any-
thing like that conversation. I can only give
the substance of it. Itoceurred longago. He
asked me about the location of the troops, and
I told him the strength of each post, and as
near as I can recollect the commanding officer
of the post.
Question. Go on, sir; if that is not all.
Answer. That was the substance and im-
portant part of the conversation. There was
some conversation as to whether more troops
should be sent here or not. I recommended
that there should be troops here, and called
the President's attention to a report of Gen-
eral Canby, my predecessor, recommending
that there should always be at the seat of
Government at least a brigade of infantry, a
battery of artillery, and a squadron of cavalry ;
and some conversation, mostly of my own, was
had in reference to the formation of a military
force in Maryland that was then going on.
Question. What military force?
Ansioer. A force organized by the State of
Maryland.
Question. Please state as well as you can
what you stated to the President, in substance,
relative to the formation of that military force.
Answer. I merely stated that I did not see
the object of it. us near as I can recollect, and
that 1 did not like the organization; I saw no
necessity for it.
Question. Did you state what your objections
were to the organization?
Answer. I think it is likely I did; but I can-
not recollect exactly at this time what they
| were. I think it likely that I stated that they
| were clothed in uuifoim that was offensive to
! our people, some j>oitions of them; and that
j they were officered by gentlemen who had been
i in the southern army.
