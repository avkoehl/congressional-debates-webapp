Major-General McDOWELL:

My inspection report of Shields' division is just finished. It is too long to telegraph. Shall I send it by mail? Infantry present: First Brigade, 2,242; Second Brigade, 1,325: Third Brigade, 1,090; Fourth Brigade, 1,217; artillery, twenty-two guns, 458 men; cavalry, 427 men.

Inspector-General, U. S. Army.

MANASSAS, June 28, 1862.

Major-General McDOWELL, Washington:

The Third and Fourth brigades of Shields' division are off-the Third last night, the Fourth early this morning. The others are loading up and moving as fast as the railroad department can furnish transportation. General Ferry reports that the order to go on himself did not reach him in time to go last night, and he did not go until early this morning. He is by this time, I think, in Alexandria. His orders are to superintend the embarkation. What shall be done with the cavalry and artillery of the division? The last order suspends all action in regard to them. Shall they go by rail or not?

The wagon train passed headquarters this morning; from the time occupied in passing I should think it between 3 and 4 miles long. The troops would get off faster of cars could be furnished.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MANASSAS, June 28, 1862-3 o'clock.

Colonel E. SCHRIVER, Chief of Staff:

SIR: I have 1,583 men for duty, viz: New Jersey cavalry, aggregate for duty, 613; Pennsylvania cavalry, aggregate for duty, 738; Bucktails, aggregate for duty, 184; mountain howitzer battery at Fredericksburg, estimate, 48; total, 1,583.

The sick are: New Jersey cavalry-sick, 22; horses serviceable, 625. Pennsylvania cavalry-sick, 64; horses serviceable, 853. Bucktails-sick, 13. Shoes, boots, haversacks, canteens, poncho-tents, and wagon wheels, which are absolutely indispensable, are at Fredericksburg, sent there in anticipation of our moving thither. Can I order them by telegraph sent on here? My brigade is in no condition to move at present. To-morrow or next day I expect a hood many stores that are needed.

We have only three kegs of horseshoes to shoe 500 horses. All they send here are Numbers 5, and entirely too large.

Yours,

GEO. D. BAYARD,

Brigadier-General.
