Mi Reynolds piesented the memorial of the
General Assembly of the State of Illinois, piay-
mg, for ceitain reasons therein contained, an ex-
tension of the rational road westwaid, to cross
the Mississippi at Alton, and not at St Louis
The memoual fotatts that to cross the Missis-
sippi at Alton, would be in accoidunce with the
ultimate destination of said road to the capital of
the State of Missouu 1 his route would be more
advantageous to the commercial and agiicultural
interest of Illinois than any other, and would also
afford to Illinois and her sister States a more direct
and convenient chain of intercommunication than
any other route. That for the national road to ci oss
the river at St Louis, in Missouri, " would not
' only be highly detrimental to the prospeuty of this
'State, (Illinois,) but in violation of her just preten-
1 sions,-and of her ngnts of so\ ereignty, contrary to
' the avowed policy of the General Government, and
' in open defiance of those princ pies of even handed
'justice and impartiality which have characterized
'her dealings with other States in lelation to this
'subject "
On this statement of facts, and the reasoning
thereon, the memorial gives to the United States
the "consent" of the State to extend the road
thiough the terntoiy of the State, so as to cioss
the river at Alton
Mr R added one other fact to what is stated in

to be the seat of Government, after the constitu

Government to oe at Vandalia ]
