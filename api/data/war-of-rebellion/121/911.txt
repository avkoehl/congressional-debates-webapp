GENERAL: Richard Turner, commonly called Dick Turner, was arrested by my predecessor in the command of this department, Major-General Ord, and confined in Libby Prison, where he still remains.

No charges against him were filed, and I know of no offense committed by him except that common rumor accuses him of the cruel treatment of our prisoners while he was a turnkey at the Libby.
