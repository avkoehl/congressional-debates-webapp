CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, August 20, 1864.

A portion of our force in the Valley crossed the Shenandoah at Front Royal on the 16th and drove the enemy's cavalry, which retreated toward Winchester, burning the hay and wheat stacks in their route. On the 17th Sheridan began to retire from his position; was pursued by General Early, who overtook two divisions of the Sixth Corps and large force of cavalry at Winchester; drove them through the town and captured over 200 prisoners, some of whom belonged to Wilson's cavalry division. Enemy has fallen back toward Harper's Ferry.
