April 30, I ordered the assistant medical purveyor to discontinue his sub-depot at Burke's Station, and proceed with train and supplies to City Point and report to Medical Purveyor Brinton. The Sixth Corps was then at Danville, where it remained some time. Other corps of the army marched for Alexandria early in May.

The depot hospital Army of the Potomac, at City Point, was ordered to be reduced 2,500 beds April 30, and to be moved to Alexandria May 4, and again to be finally discontinued May 25. After the cases had been properly disposed of [by transfer to general hospital in Washington, and to Alexandria for discharge from service] the establishment ceased to exist. The purveying department, which was reduced in May, was terminated and the property turned in at Washington in June. The contracts of acting assistant and acting staff surgeons were canceled on the breaking up of the army. On the 30th of June, 1865, the Army of the Potomac ceased to exist as an organization.

The non-receipt of many sub-reports makes this necessarily incomplete. As I may be unable hereafter to give proper attention to the subject, I deem it advisable not to delay rendering what is now available.

Of the hospital fund in my hands, accruing from tax on the sales of newspapers in the Army of the Potomac, I have applied to the purchase of luxuries for the hospitals and necessary articles for the transactions of the business of the medical department since last report, $ 5,070.35. The amount received from such tax since June 1, 1865, has been $ 6,384. On hand December 31, 1864, last report, $ 9,025,04. The balance remaining in my hands upon breaking up of the Army of the Potomac, June 29, 1865, $ 10,339.04. This balance, pursuant to proceedings and recommendations of the Board appointed by Special Orders, Numbers 163, headquarters Army of the Potomac, approved by the commanding general, was turned over by me July 1, 1865, to the Surgeon-General, in trust, to be made a donation from the Army of the Potomac to the National Asylum, created by act of Congress approved March 3, 1865. [See appendix.]
