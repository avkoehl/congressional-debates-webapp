Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: A contraband that left Stony Creek day before yesterday states that the Weldon railroad is being repaired from Belfield to the Nottoway River, and that large parties of infantry are at work on it; that the cavalry is principally at Stony Creek Station, though a large force is at Belfield; that he was told by a cavalryman Hill's corps had been ordered back to Belfield again; did not know if it had gone. Destruction of the railroad has done great injury to the cavalry; horses are dying for want of forage.
