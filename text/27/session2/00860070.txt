CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
chañan ] It was. an able paper, simple anl exp'i 1
cit in its statement', and calm and moderate m Us
tone. It h\á a stiU higher and rarer merit, it was
manly in i s admissions He regarded its admis-
sions as furnishing the most triumphant vindication
of the course of the party wi'h wmch he had acted
since 1837
The first of its admissions is, that a Back of the
United S ales  would be «inadvisable at this time,
even if it were free from all constitutional  objec-
tions and thi5 on the ground that its stock, in the
present state of things, wou'd not be subscribed by
individuals    In this opinion he entirely concurred
It was the ground he assumed dnnng the late ses-   |
Bion, but he did not concur with the au hor of the
report in attributing it to the cause he did,   cr m
xegardirg the cause as of a temporary character
On the contrary, he believed it to be permaien1, so
much so, that he had no fear taat there would be
another United Stales Bank, during the present
generation at least    The fact is, that the banking
system, under its present modification, is running
down, and is already greatly discredited; but a
Bank of the United Siates has not only partaken of
this general discredit, but was still more depressed
from causes peculiar to itself, which he need not
explain    Tne fact was, that it is, from circum-
stances neces an y accompanying it, among thol ast
xespon lb e of all tanks, as experience has proved
Amodg   the>e is the fact,  that whi'e   its stock-
holdeis are scattered over our widespread region,
■with man) in Europe, us place for basia'ss and
control, as well   as  its direction, muit be local
No?/, when v c take into consideration how small
the ínteres of t! e direction, as stockholder0, muot
bt,, to he aggregate amount of its capí al, and how
lumper cot he knowledge of the stockholder , in their
«satte- d "ituation, must be, both as to th* charac-
ter of these who may constitute the direct on, or of
th'ir mir-'sement, that there is po adeqiaehold,
ettl er (rom interest cr respon ibi ity,   to   restrict
them tf  tne   faithlul   discharge   of   their   trust
"Why, then,   sKculd it be surprising    bat  their
powers shou! 1 bt abu=ed, and that, ins e d of osmg
direc e 1 to a 1 •« r ce the general interest of the con-
cern, they should b   perverted into the means of

and d lectors reside together, an i vli-sre the cha-
racter and management of the la terare wen knovn
to the former, and are held cons antly under strict
responsibility and supervision by them
But there ñas another still more important ad-
misión It recomme-ds tne E/cneqaer «cheme
"whi'h it propose on in  g lunas, fir t, that it is
no corporati in, and next, i'^at it gr?ited no spe-
cial pr /lieges, anl,agan, th iQoíc mei t wo Id

ibat it is a corporation, of t at it g-anted special

and he was now happy to see this a''mis i n in the
high quarter from wr < h it comes There were
oth-r, and not u-nrnportant pdmission , which he,
for tne present, would pass in silence He viewed
these admissions with far more pleasure than pride.
It marks the irresistible progress of trutn.   What
space it has passed over in the last four or five
years' How much it has narrowed the interval
between the ground on which he, and those with
whom he acts, now occupy, from that on which
those from whom this document comes, then stood'
All that we have to do is to stand fast—time and
refl-cti n would be sure to bring our opponents to
us    We have truth on our side.
But he owed it to cjndor to state that as much    |
removed as the space is between us,  we were
still widely separated.   There were many and de-
cisive objections to the scheme  proposed.   They
had been strongly and clearly pointed out by the
Senator from Pennsylvania.   He agreed with him,
tha' it would be a Government Bank, not only in
effect, but reality    As far as discounting bills of
exchange is concerned, it would plainly be so    In
this important branch of banking, it would  clearly
exercise   all  the   functions of a bank, without
stretching trie powers which it would possess, and
who does not see that almost the entire operation   |
of banking may very readily assume this most
dan?erous of its forms'!    He also concurred with
the Senator that it would, at no long interval, be-
come a mere machine for issuing irredeemable pa-
per     The   report itself, among  its admissions,
siates tha' the'e is an almost irrepressible tendency
on the part of banks to excess in their operations
It   i    true,   but   not  the   less   so,    that    there
is    the   same    terdency   m   a'l   paper   circu
lations,   and,   if   possible,   stronger    in    most
of   its    forms     than    that    of    banks    them-
selves.     It    is,   said   Mr    C     (boding    up a
small  piece of paper of the size and shape of
a bank note,) a tremendous power to invest any
man, or body sf men, with the power of convert-
ing a smell and worthless piece of paper like this,
into money, to make a hundred,   or a   thousand
do'lars, by writing a few words, and attaching a
few signatures to it, and send it for h in the com-
munity as goods, or gold and silver    It is a higher
power than  that, so long and ardently sought by
the alchymis's—a power higher than ought to be
conferred on mi rtal man, without effectual guards
against abnse, if such indeed can   be found    He
finally concurred-with the Senator, thai  it would
add greatly to the public deb', to which he had in
superable objections.
Either of these objections ought to be fatal to
to any scheme, in his opinion Having stated them,
he did not deem it necessary to advtrt to other ob-
jections at present, but he would take the opportu
nity of saying that he, for one, could not agree to
any plan that would materially change the ground
on which he h-retofore has stood on this subject
We on this side had deliberately, and with high
and patriotic motives, «elected our ground, and he
I felt hat he could venture to say for those around
him, as well as for himself, that we intend to ad-
| here substan lally to our position He had now
briefly and frankly expressed his views of the re-
port, and of the scheme it recommended In giv
I ing utterance to h s opinions, h  had been actua-
ted sole'y by a desire that there should be no mis.
take as to h s view=, on the part of those he ie-
presented, as well as those with whom he ac.ed,
and witl out the least unkind feelings towards the
high quarter from which this paper emanated
Mr RIVES said that the honciab'e Senator
from New York being disqualified by indisposi-
tion from taking any part in this discussion, he
felt himself called upon, as in some sort represent-
ing that honorahle gentleman, as well from per
sonal feelings of ?ttachm nt as from similarity rf
political principles, to say a word or two That
gentleman i ad considered remarks on the rep rt
at this time as out of place, because the paper was
to go into the hands of the committee, where its
shipe might be materially changed and the scheme
thereby freed from objections to which it was now
liable He had listened with pleasure to the Se-
nators from Pennsylvania and South Carolina,
but thoiuV they night have spared tneTiselves the
remarks in wh ch they had indulged Mr R. was
per uaded that his honorable friend from New
York [Mr Tallmadge] never could consent to
recommend any scheme for a Government Bank He
was too fully committed against any such measure.
All the remarks of the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia on that subject vveie therefore wholly gratui-
tous, and might better have been spared until the
gentleman ascertained in what shape the measure
would be presented by th* committee for the ac-
tion of the Senate
But, while up, Mr. R must be permitted a word
or two in reply to the remarks made by both gen-
tlemen.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania had
denounced the scheme   as   a great  Government
Bank, mainly because§ the Board was to have the
powei of issuing a circulating paper credit, and
this was a banking faculty    Bui fa>e Senator from
South Carolina   insisted   that   in the progress of
modern science it had been discovered that no such
faculty belonged to the banking system, but, on
the contrary, was whol'y a'ien from i ; and this
was undoubtedly the true doctrine    The Senator
had urged it in 1837, yes, but it was then no no-
velty.    Long before that   day, M   Ricardo had
suggested   the general  principle, and ever since
it had been broached by that great ma , it  had
been frise lfying in the public mind    His general
principle was  this, that the power of issue is a
power to create, while the power of banking is a
power to use    The two powers were essentially
d stinct,   and   in   their    nature    incompatib'e.
The   same    idea    had    been    taken    up   by
Torrens,   by   Samuel   Jones   Lloyd,   and    by
Mr.   Clay,   a   member   of   the   British    Par-
liament    A committee of the House of Commons
had last year taken up the whole subject—a com-
mittee, consisting of such men as the Chancellor
of ihe  Excheqt e , Mr Peel, Mr Clay, Mr. Ellis
S Parnell, and o'her gentlemen distinguished for
their knowledge of finance.   After a full investiga-
tion, seven out of tune of tap t committee had come
to the cone! jsion that there must be a complete se-
pai at on between the pow er to issue a circulation
and the power of banking     Their scheme is, that
a pap°r money, redeemable m specie, shall be is-
sued by public authont), not, however, by execu-
tive agen's, but by commissioners acting under
parliamentary authority.    Such was the plan re-
commendtd m  England, and which was gaining
to ike'f more and more favor.   The plan had been
reduced to pr?ctice in Prussia, a kingdom which
now enjoyed the best cuirenoy in the world     Un
like the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr R.
had never been the advoca e of a Government pa-
per currency, p'opeily so called, i e paper which
rested solely on the credit of Government, and was
mcoivertiole into gold and silver, although made
by law a legal tender.   The gentleman from South
Carolina had sene peculiar notions of his own m
1837 about a convertible papei  currency being
behind the a{?e     [Mr Ca'.hoon was understood to
dissent from the construction given his previous
views on this subject ]     But was such a currency
as he had described  the  currency proposed by the
bill?    Par from it     While it was waeed guaran-
tied by the faith of Government, it was required
tobe  convenble at pleasure into gold and silver,
by whieh it was meant that th  rnper issue should
Lave a specie basi , dollar for dollar    The gen-
tleman from Pennsjlvania thought otherwise, but
that was a mere reader of detail, to be regulated
by the committee.
In replv to Mr Buchanan's remarks on the re-
fusal of bills of credi m the convention, Mr R.
referred him to the explanatory note of Mr Madi-
'on, wmch declared that this was rot intended to
prohibit Government from issung notes for its own
accommodation, bat was aimed so'ely at such a
paper currency as ¡e ted simply on the credit of
Government, and was, at the same time, made a
legal tender But on his subject both those gen-
tlemen had tlrown stones just as if they did not
themselves dwell in glass houses What were the
Treasury m.tes advocated by their party? Whence
fhsaiut-onty to is^ue them, if the d( ctrme they
now e'vocat^d was correct1 The Sena'or from
Soath Ca juna wao ftr separating the power of
is" e fíoríi ihe power of di count, but how was he
gong to do it, if he opposed eveiy arrangement
like that m the bill] He was not in favor of an
exclusive metallic currency, but for a sound paper
circulation. He contended that this could not is-
sue from the banks, whence then was it to pro-
ceed, if not from the authority of Government)
