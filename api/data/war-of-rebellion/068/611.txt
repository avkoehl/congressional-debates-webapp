HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 10, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

Only so much of General Ferrero's division will be sent as convoy to our empty wagons ordered to Belle Plain as the quartermaster in charge may deem sufficient. The remainder will be continued on, as at present, duty of guarding roads to our rear and on which our trains move. General Ferrero has been so instructed. This will enable you to use your Provisional Brigade if you need it.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Alsop's House, May 10, 1864-2.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: By concentrating the three divisions of the corps at Gayle's I can make a very heavy attack upon the right flank of the enemy, or I can have the two divisions at Gayle's make a demonstration, and put the other division in rear of Mott's division, who is on the left of Wright's corps. I write this because I do not know if you would care to run the risk of allowing the enemy to break through Mott's on the road from Alsop's Spotsylvania. Which do you think had best be done? I have directed the bearer to proceed with greatest possible haste and he will bring your answer.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 10, 1864-3.20 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Your dispatch of 2.15 p. m. just received. It will now be too late to bring up your third division. I will have to leave it to your judgment whether it will be best to attack with your two divisions as they are, or whether one of them should be sent to Mott. As the attack is to be general, however, I incline to the opinion you will be secure in attacking as you are. I want the attack promptly made in one or other of the modes proposed.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
