the armies in the field anticipates an attack, and from the rear, and the major-general commanding enjoins strict vigilance on the part of all the troops, but especially upon the cavalry. Please let me know with some detail the line of cavalry pickets, and have them pushed out as far as practicable, particularly on the west and southwest. The various attacks on the cavalry pickets a few days ago may have been for the purpose of ascertaining the best mode of approaching and attacking our rear, and the pickets should, therefore, be pushed out farther. Please enjoin upon all the necessity of prompt and rapid communication of intelligence of the enemy.

Brigadier-General GREGG,

Commanding Cavalry:

In the evening of an attack by the enemy on our rear, it is probable their cavalry would endeavor to cross the Blackwater at some points below where we hold, and come up upon our trains between City Point and our lines. Please keep this in view as among the contingencies.
