HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK,October 28, 1861.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.

SIR: I inclose a copy of a letter received from Commodore Forrest and beg you to lay it before the Secretary of War that he may if he pleases give me instructions what to do with such persons. There will be many of them here. I will not let these men go by a flag of truce, and General Wool saves me the trouble of prohibiting them at present by refusing to receive a flag. The law of Congress and the proclamation of the President gave a certain time for all who desire to do so to leave; that time has elapsed. Who is to determine who are our enemies amongst us, and who is to arrest them and how are they to be punished? My time is fully occupied attending to our enemies elsewhere, and I see no one who has or takes any authority to carry out the law above referred to.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

OCTOBER 30, 1861.

Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

Answer that as whereas enemies have had ample time to leave we now put them all in prison as prisoners of war and to send the men here as such. Write to same effect to passport clerk. Show me the letters.
