$670,000 for every half year from the last day
of December, 1866, until the 1st of June,
1868, which amounts to some two and a quar-
ter million dollars. I suppose the Senator
can explain that.

accounts of disbursing officers.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move to reconsider the
vote by which the Senate adopted a short time
ago, on the motion of the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Wilson,] the amendment of
the House of Representatives to the joint res-
olution (S. R. No. 173) to facilitate the settle-
j ment of the accounts of disbursing officers.
' It is a proposition to allow an appeal from the
accounting officers to the Secretary of the
Interior with a view to get additional allow-
j ances. I do not think we ought to legislate in
that direction.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Let me make a state-
! ment. I have referred to the law and I think
there is no trouble about it. It is an act to
amend the act regulating the fees, costs, and
other judicial expenses of the Government of
the United States, approved August 16, 1856.
The first section is:
That hereafter, before the accounts of the United
States marshals, district attorneys, and clerks are
presented to the accounting officers of the Treasury
Department for settlement, they shall bo examined
ana certified to by the district judge of the United
States.
It goes on and provides for their examina-
tion. The fourth section provides that in all
the cases before mentioned an appeal shall lie
from the decision of the accounting officers to
the Secretary of the Iuterior. An appeal lies,
that is the law now, in every ease since 1856.
Now, the effect of the proposition that is on the
table isthat the provisions of this act., applying
to district attorneys, marshals, and clerks, are
extended to the act of February 26,1853. The
fee bills were altered in 1856, it seems, some-
what for these officers. I see no objection to it.
If appeals are allowed from the settlement of
the accounts to the Secretary of the Interior,
as it seems they are under the general law, I
do not know why they should not be allowed
in all cases.
Mr. SHERMAN. A few years ago there
was a great deal of controversy about the dis-
position of the judiciary fund, which was a large
fund, about a million dollars, and is more than
that now. The allowances that are made to the
district attorneys and marshals are first ap-
proved by the judge and sent to the accounting
officers. This authorizes an appeal from the
accounting officers to the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, so that it virtually allows the Secretary of
the Interior to make these allowances. It
seems to me to be bad policy. The accounting
officers of the Treasury are the persons who
have to guard the Treasury, and the only pro-
tection the Treasury has in the disbursement of
this enormous fund is the rules established by
the accounting officers; but under this provis-
ion every case can be appealed to the Secretary
of the Interior, so that he may increase the
allowances made by the judge and by the
accounting officers. I do not think we ought
to legislate in that direction.
Mr. CONNESS. I ask the Senator why he
does not reconsider the amendment and then
discuss it.
Mr. SHERMAN. The rote has been recon-
sidered.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pohe-
roy in the chair.) The question is on the re-
consideration.
Mr. SHERMAN. I think we had bettet
disagree to the amendment and send the bill
back to the House and let them recede from
the amendment.
Mr. WILSON. I am perfectly willing to
do that. I do not know anything about that
last provision.
Mr. SHERMAN. We can probably pass the
bill quickeT in that way.
Mr. TRUMBULL. " I do not know myself
why it should be reconsidered. The proposi-
tion is plain enough. The Senator from Ohio
has not looked into it, and has never consid-
ered it in committee. I have looked at the
statutes to which it refers. It is a simple prop-
osition. Anybody can understand it in one
minute.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is done for the purpose
of opening up some old charges.
