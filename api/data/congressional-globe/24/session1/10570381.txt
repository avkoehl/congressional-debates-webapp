of the Federal offices throughout the Union. If
so, what just cause of complaint have honorable
gentlemen of the Opposition against the Admin-
istration ?
My colleague, Mr. Chairman, also read to the
House an extract from the letters addressed by
General Jackson to the Legislature of Tennessee,
resigning his seat in the Senate of the United
States, dated 14th October, 1825, in which the
General,among other things, informed the Legis-
lature that he fully accorded with them in the
contemplated change in the Constitution: "And
4 indeed, would go further, with a view to sustain,
4more effectually in practice, the action which
4 divides the three great classes of power into in-
4 dependent constitutional checks. I would im-
4 pose a provision rendering any member of Con-
4gress ineligible to office under the General
4 Government during the term for which he was
4 elected, and for two years thereafter, except in
4 cases of judicial office," &c.
Sir, this amendment to the Constitution has
never been made; and now what is the complaint
■ of my colleague? It is, that General Jackson has
violated the' principle then recommended to the
Legislature of Tennessee, by conferring upon
members of Congress important appointments
under the General Government; and to prove that
violation of principle upon the President, has given
us his table of those appointments and their sal-
aries. Suppose, Mr. Chairman, General Jackson
in that letter had suggested to the Legislature of
Tennessee an amendment to the Constitution, by
-which the President of the United States should
lie deprived of having any voice in the passage
•of laws by Congress, by which the power that
■now makes it his duty to approve and sign bills
passed by Congress before they have the force
of laws, should be taken away forever. Sup-
pose, also, the General, after having given his
-opinión, ha* been elected President of the United
States, and that he had refused to approve and
sign bills passed by Congress, upon the ground
that he had given to the Legislature of Tennessee
the opinion that the President ought not to have
any such power. Sir,'in the case supposed, the
President would have been impeached and re-
moved from office if he had refused Co approve
and sign bills upon the grounds stated, when, by
the Constitution, it was his sworn duty to do so;
he would have deserved impeachment and remo val
from office. What, then, I ask, is the difference
in principle between the case supposed and the
esse contained in the letter? The amendment
suggested In that letter has never bean made to
the Constitution.
By the Constitution, member* of Congress are
eligible to executive appointments. The Presi-
dent is sworn "to preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution-" as it is, not as he would have
it to be. If, then, the President had introduced in
practice what would have been a virtual amend-
ment to the Constitution itself, he would nave
been guilty of the high crime of usurpation. For
he would have substituted his individual will in
place of the Constitution itself, and thereby have
assumed to himself to determine, not according
to the Constitution, but according to his own sov-
ereign will, who were and who were wot eligible
to office under the General Government. Yes^
sir, he would have expunged the Constitution
itseéfWor if he could render members of Congress
ineligjbje, the principle upon which he would do
that, if carriedout in practice, would render all
nthei persons equally ineligible. I must, there-
fore be allowed to differ in opinion with my col-
league on this subject. I think the President has
done right in having administered, the Constitu-
tion as it is—in having followed after the foot-
steps of his predecessors in office, even if Some
members ofCongress have been appointed. To
show, however, that the President has pursued
a course of appointment warranted by his' first
annual message, delivered to Congress, December
8,1829, I will read to the committee the follow-
ing extract, viz:
"White members of Congress can be constitutionally
appointed to offices of trust or profit, U will be the practice,
even under ffie most conscientious adherence to duty, to
«elect them for such stations as theyare believed to be bet-
ter qualified to till than other citizens; but the purity of
our Government would doubtless be promoted by then- ex-
clusion fro  all appointments in the gift of the President,
in whose election thev have been officially concerned. The
nature of the judicial office, and the necessity of securing
in the Cabinet, and in diplomatic stations of the highest
rank,the best talents and political experience, should, per-
haps, except these from the exclusion."
But, sir, to show what members of Congress
have been appointed during the term for which
they were elected under General Jackson's ad-
ministration, I request the Clerk to read to the
committee the message of the President bearing
date the 23d January, 1833, disclosing-the same
to Congress. This message exhibits the follow-
ing appointments of members of Congress, viz:

Mr. Chairman, my colleague called the attan 
tion of the House to the letter written by General
Jackson to the Governor of IndianaT on the 38th
day of February,, 1828, in which., the General
avowed himself friendly to the tariff and, internal
improvements, and proved the General an enemy
to interna] improvements, especially in the west 
em country; referred us ton  veto-on the.|May.«iT
yille road i bill and the LotnWUe, and .Portland
canal bill. Sir, I have taken from, an official re 
port of the Secretary of the. Treasury made  to
Congress pa the. 17th of January) 1835, the fol 
lowing statements of the sura  expanded on works
of internal improvements during tie < four years
of Mr. Adams's administration, and,'the first four
years of General Jackson's administration, Mr,
Adams, $1,249,326 &i- General Jackson's first
term, #2,054,057 08; by which it appears that
4704,730 32 were expended on works of internal
improvements, not local, but national in their
character, more than was expended during Mr.
Adam'  administration.- It also, appears, that
for the year 1833, the sum. expended under this
Administration for internal improvements was
#940,488 95.
Another subject of complaint, Mr. Chairman,
grows out of the expenditures of General Jack-
son's administration, compared with others. It
is.true, sir, that, as the United States increase in
1 population, States, territory, and wealth, the ex-
penditures of the General Government must in-
crease. Before I proceed, however, to show the
cause of that increase, I beg leave to state how
much of the public debt Mr. Monroe paid during
i the last .four years of his administration, how
j much Mr. Adams paid, and how much General
.Jackson paid during his first four years—viz:
Mr. Monroe paid #39,034,452 91, Mr. Adams
paid #45,303,533 43, and General Jackson paid
#57,754,303 51; by which if, appears that Mr.
Adams paid of public debt more than Mr. Mon-
roe did, during his last four years, by the sum of
#6,269,080 52; and General Jackson paid during
his, first four years,more than Mr, Adams did by
#12,450,770 08.               
If, sir, you exclude from the calculation of the
annual expenditures of tbt> Government the
aujouxitpajd by each in discharge of thepublic debt
ahovastated, then the accounts tand s thus, viz: Mr.
Monroe's last four years of national expenditures,,
#42,Ü9J,73& 17; Mr- Adams's #50,501,913 31,
showing i an, increase in Mr. Adams's time over
Mr. Monroe's last four years of #7,510,177 14;
¡ GeneralJBcl4son'sfirstfom!y<ws,#5e,270j480 62,
showing an increase of expenditures more than
I Mr. Adams iwuuredof #5,768,567 31, and showing
i also thattheratio of increaaeinthe expenditures of
Government incurred by General Jackson during
his first four years fell short of that incurred by-
Mr. Adams, when compared with the expendi-
tures of Mr. Monroe's last four years, by #1,941*-
607 83; in other words,,that General Jackson's
.first four years, applying the same ratio of in-
crease, was much more economical i than Mr.
Adams's was) compared with Mr. Monroe's.
But, sir, what has swelled, the national expendi-
tures? I answer, 1st. The sums .appropriated
by Congress, to-internal improvements,as I have
already shown. 2d. The treaties made with
foreign nations since General Jackson came into
sower. The following is a list of them,.,viz;
Treaty with Denmark, March' 28th,, 1830; treaty
of commerce with Mexico, April 5th, 1831; treaty
of limits with the same; treaty of indemnity with
Prance, 4th of July, 1831 •, treaty with the. TwxJ
Sicilies, 14th. October, 1632; treaty of commerce
and navigation with Russia, December 18, 1832;
treaty of amity and commerce with Siam,,20 th
March, 1833; treaty, of commerce with Chili,
September 1st, 1833; treaty of amity and com-
merce wkh Muscat, September 21st, 1833; and a
treaty of indemnity with Spain, 17th of February,
1834, yielding a sum (I mean those obtaining in-
demnities) of #7,942,000, to be paid American
citizens for long standing injuries, andan thecasu
of France for more than, twenty-five years. 3d,
Treaties with the Indian tribes, a statement of
which 1 hold,in my hand* from the War Depart;
meat, by which it appears forty-two treaties, havo
been made, and- the value of the lands acquired by
them, at Congress price, is equal to about fifty-
five millkuis.of dollars; but valuable as theyare
in a, pecuniary paint; of view, the benefits result-
ing to the western country by their acquisition, in
extending the setlements, trade, commerce, and,
wealth of the West, are, incalculable. 4th, The
removal'of the Indians to the west of.the Missis-
sippi river, and. the expenses, incident to their
settlement, is another prolific, source of increased
expenditures under this Administration.
Finally, sir, I am happy to find that no honor- 
able member on this floor pretenda to charge the
Administration- with having expended one cent
more tian waa warranted oy the laws of Con-
gress. And this presents the question, whether(
when laws are passed by Congress making large
appropriations, and they are faithfully applied to
the, objects designated in the laws, any blame
whatever can or ought to attach to the Execu.
five? He does not make the laws, but is bound
to see them faithfully executed; and if any blame
attaches anywhere for extravagances in the pub-
lic expenditures, it is to Congress. Considering,
however, the rapidity with which everything
increase  in a national point of view, I am not
