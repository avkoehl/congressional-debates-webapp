I have ont relieved these guards, because they were not embraced in the district allotted to my command, and now merely report the fact lest they may be withdrawn under some misapprehension, without having their places supplied.

No news of the enemy in my front. The bushwhackers are report to be concentrating in some on Waldron's Bridge. I will learn more of their movements and inform you.
