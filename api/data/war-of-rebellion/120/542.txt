together, sheltered only by barracks only by blankets and low hovels densely and irregularly arranged, preventing free circulation, engendering foul and noxious vapors, and precluding any system of police. The men are exposed during the day to the rays of the sun and to dews at night, and many are entirely unprotected during rains. The hospital accommodations are utterly inadequate to accommodate the large number of sick. The hospital is located in a grove on the bank of the creek, southeastward from the stockade. The site is the most eligible in the vicinity with the present appliances. There is a great deficiency in the number of tents in which the sick are treated; they are also too small for hospital purposes. A constant increase in number of prisoners and hence of the sick has called for a continued expansion of hospital accommodations. The hospital grounds were first designed to accommodate 1,000 sick and were fitted up as best could be with the means on hand. Since that time the number of sick in hospital has increased to 2,208, and*.

Fifth. Establishment of regulations in regard to cleanliness. - It should be the duty of Confederate sergeants attending roll-call, or others, to see that all men of their commands bathe at stated intervals and that their clothes are washed at least once a week. For this purpose soap should be issued to the prisoners.

Sixth. Improvement in rations. - The meal, if possible, should be bolted before issued. Arrangements should be speedily made by which rice, beans, and other anticscorbutics should be issued. During the present season green corn might be issued in lieu of the bread ration, if not regularly, at least three times a week. If possible, the prisoners should be supplied with vinegar occasionally, and an occasional issue of molasses in lieu of meat ration would tend greatly to correct the scurvy, which prevails to a great extent.
