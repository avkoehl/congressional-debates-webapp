HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-8 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Since writing by Captain Jay, Captain Sanders has come in and reported condition of affairs. He says Griffin has advanced and been checked. This modifies my dispatch; still I should like to know the exact morale of your corps. Ord reports he cannot move till you get out of the way. Can't you let him pass out on your right, and let him try what he can do?

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
