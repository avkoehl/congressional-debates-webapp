Mr. FESSENDEN. We have now arrived
at what seems to be a good place to stop, and
I think it would be very hard on the Clerk to
go any l'urtherto-day. I propose, therefore, to
stop here with this bill to-day if the Senate is
willing.
Mr. CONNESS. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive busi-
ness.
Mr. IIENDRICKS. I think we might as
well adjourn. It is pretty hard work to attend
to this bill for so many hours, and I move an
adjournment.
Mr. CONNESS. I desire a short executive
session for a particular purpose which will only
occupy a few moments.
Mr. IIENDRICKS. Very well, T withdraw
my motion.
The motion of Mr. CONNESS was agreed
to; and after some time spent in executive
session the doors were reopened, and the- Sen-
ate adjourned.

pensions.
Mr. PERU AM, from the Committee on In-
valid Pensions, to which was referred a reso-
lution of the House in regard to an increase
of pensions, with leave to report at any time,
reported back the same with an accompany-
ing bill increasing the pensions of widows and
orphans, and for other purposes; which was
read a first and second tune.
The bill was read in full. It extends the
provisions of the pension laws to provost niai-
shals, deputy provost mai.-hals, and enrolling
officers who have been killed or wounded in
the discharge of their duty ; and^ for the pur-
pose of determining the amount of pensions to
which such persons and their dependents shall
be entitled, provost marshals shall be ranked
as captains, deputy provost marshals as first
lieutenants, and enrolling officers as second
lieutenants. The bill also provides for an in-
crease of two dollars per month foi each child
of deceased soldiers orsailois under sixteen
years of age, and where there is more than one
child and no widow, the pension to such chil-
dren shall lie increased to the same amount that
would be allowed under the foregoing provisions
to the widow if living and entitled to a pension ;
provided that in no ease shall more than one
pension be allowed to the same person.
Mr. PERIIAM. In presenting this report I
am directed by the Committee on Invalid Pen-
sions to make a brief statement to the House
of our legislation in reference to the subject of
granting pensions.
Early in tho last Congress and repeatedly
during the whole Congress propositions were
presented to the committee for an increase of
pensions, and the committee became satisfied
that the tax-payers of this country generally
desired that the pensions of the wounded sol-
diers and of the dependents of such as have
been killed in the service should be increased.
The committee fully recognized the propriety
of that, believing that the increase in the cost
of living would warrant to tho fullest extent
an increase of pension. Tho question arose
in the committee, how shall that increase be
made?
The committee found that there was a largo
class of persons who, in their opinion, were
entitled to pensions, lint who were excluded
by the prov isions of the law and the rules for
the administration of the law in that regard.
They therefore thought it proper to extend the
provisions of the law to that class of people.
They also found that a large number of persons
wdio were receiving eight dollars per month
were suffering under comparatively slight dis-
ability, to whom eight dollars a month is a very
fair compensation for their disability. Tliey
found, also, that a great many other persona
entitled to pensions weie entirely disabled, who
had lost both hands or both eyes or had been
shot almost to pieces, who were in such a con-
dition that absolutely required tho constant
attention of others to help them along through
life. We came to the conclusion that the best
way to increase pensions was to increase them
to these disabled pensioners in proportion to
their disabilities.
Previous to the act of .July 14,1802, privates
in the Marine corps were entitled to S3 50 and
sailors five dollars per month. Widows of the
Florida and Indian and Mexican wars, 50,
and of tho war of 1812 four dollars per month.
By this act the pensions to these classes of
persons engaged in the war then in progress,
as well as all the widows, were increased to
eight dollars; and extended to minor children
and dependent mothers, and sisters of deceased
ofliceis, soldieis, and sailors. By the act of
July -I, 18i; 1. the provisions of the pension laws
were extended to persons, not enlisted, who
volunteered to fight in any organized military
force.
It was found that in some instances persons
who hail been enlisted but not mustered into
the service were forced into battle at once and
were cither killed or disabled before they were
mustered in. This act allows pensions to such
soldiers the same as if they had been mustered
in. It also proposes to increase the pensions of
those who had lost two eyes or two hands to
twenty-five dollars a month, and those who have
lost two feet to twentv dollars per month.
-Mr. TROWBRIDGE. I would like to ask
the gentleman a question which was put to me
last Hiâ¢ht by a soldier who has been wounded
and who would be entitled to a pension. I
am glad of this opportunity of asking the gen-
tleman if there is any law which denies to an
invalid pensioner his pension when he goes
into the civil service of the Government.
Mr. PERIIAM. The law which excluded
him has been repealed.
Mr. TROWBRIDGE. I am very glad to
