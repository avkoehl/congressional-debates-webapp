Major-General SHERIDAN:

Make a details from your own command to go with the ambulances of the Fifth Corps to collect in your wounded. I think Lee will surrender to-day. I addressed him on the subject last evening and received a reply this morning asking the terms I wanted. We will push him until terms are agreed upon.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I respectfully inclose a dispatch from General Merritt. If this is correct the enemy must have taken the fine road north of the Appomattox Rivere. I will move on Appomattox Court-House. Should we not intercept the enemy and he be forced into Lynchburg his surrender then is beyond question.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

[Inclosure.]

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

GENERAL: I have just returned from the front. All quiet. I sent a force toward Appomattox Court-House and remained till it returned. The officer in command reports a thin line of the enemy. No disposition shown by the enemy to attack us. When I got to the front every-thing was well arranged, and there was no advance of thee enemy's infantry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.
