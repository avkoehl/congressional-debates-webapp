the accounts with the Bank of Kentucky will be made up and all its property will be paid over and delivered as if such attempted confiscation had never been made.

The result is, therefore, upon the showing of the bank by its return, that there is due and payable to the Confederate States,and therefore now to be paid to the United States, the sums following:

C. S. Treasury account.................................$219,090.94

Special accounts..................................... 12,465.00

Deposits by officers:

J. M. Huger, receiver..................................106,812,60

G. W. Ward, receiver................................... 72,084.90

J. C. Manning.......................................... 1,120.00

M. L. Smith............................................ 16,020.52

S. Maclin............................................. 6,814.57

Reichard............................................. 497,30

----------

Total................................................434,911.83

This is the legal result to which the mind must arrive in this discussion. But there are other consideration which may apply to first item of the account.

Only the notes of the Confederate States were deposited by the treasurer in the bank, and by the order of the ruling authority then here, the bank was obliged to receive them.

In equity and good conscience the Confederate States could call for nothing more than they had compelled the bank to take.

The United States succeed to rights of the Confederate, States, and should only take that which the Confederate States ought to take.

But the United States not taking or recognizing Confederate notes, can only leave them with the bank, to be held by it hereafter in special deposit, as so much worthless paper.

Therefore I must direct all the items but the first to be paid to my order for the United States, in gold, silver or Unites States Treasury notes at once. The first item of $219.090.94 I will refer to the home Government for adjudication, and in the meantime the bank must hold as a special deposit the amount of Confederate Treasury notes above mentioned and a like amount in bullion to await the decision.
