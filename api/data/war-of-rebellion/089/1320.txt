Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Sugar Loaf:

Scout Dickinson reports that the enemy have re-enforced at New Berne and are going to make a raid 20,000 strong; has not heard where they are going. Dickinson also states that at 8 o'clock last night the enemy were within eight miles of Swansborough. The expedition consists of one gun-boat, one flat, and a lot of small boats. They were coming up the sound at the time he was writing, 10 o'clock last night. The letter containing this information will be sent to you at once by courier.

NEAR HAMILTON, December 26, 1864.

Major F. S. PARKER, Sugar Loaf:

Dispatch received. If transportation can be had I hope to leave Tarborough with the two regiments from Goldsborough. I do not know how many have assembled at Goldsborough at present.

HAMILTON, N. C., December 26, 1864.

(Via Rocky Mount.)

Major F. S. PARKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A scout, whom I sent to Plymouth, reports the enemy re-enforcing. They acknowledge the loss of three boats. One is sunk near our batteries. I do not feel justified in delaying the march of the two regiments. They will reach Tarborough to-morrow night, awaiting transportation to Wilmington. I believe these two regiments are greatly needed here, but they will proceed, unless I receive your orders to the contrary.

C. LEVENTHORPE,

Brigadier-General.
