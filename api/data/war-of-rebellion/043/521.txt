rear, and then farther off, to avoid unnecessary losses by the fire of the enemy, which disabled some of my men in that position. I was soon joined there by the Third Michigan, and later in the evening by the Fortieth New York. On July 3, when the last and furious attack of the enemy took place on our right, my brigade was at once brought to form a second line, supporting our batteries, when, without being actually engaged, several officers and men were wounded by the too well directed fire of the enemy's artillery. At night I was put in command of the advance line across that part of the battle-field, which I occupied until the following day with two brigades, the Third and First, without any special occurrence to mention. It becomes now my gratifying duty to state how nobly the officers and men of my command have sustained at Gettysburg the glorious reputation won on many other battle-fields by the old Kearny (now Birney's) division. The regimental commanders have gallantly and efficiently done their duty. Among them Colonel B. R. Pierce, Third Michigan, was wounded in the leg, since amputated, as also Major D. M. Jones, One hundred and tenth Pennsylvania. Lieutenant Colonel John Pulford, Fifth Michigan, was slightly wounded in the hand. Colonel T. W. Egan had his horse killed under him. I could not mention here the field or line officers who have distinguished themselves under my eyes without injustice to the others, all of them having behaved in the most gallant manner. The officers of my staff I must mention as brave and efficient in action. Captain Ben. M. Piatt, assistant adjutant-general, had his horse shot under him, while he was himself slightly hit. Captain I. C. Smith, acting assistant inspector-general, was severely wounded in the leg, which will deprive me for a time of the services of that most valuable officer. My two aides. Lieutenants E. B. Houghton and G. W. Waldron, lent me good assistance by their gallant alacrity in the performance of their duties.O	Officers. T TotalM	Enlisted Men. --Killed---Wounded-Missing.
