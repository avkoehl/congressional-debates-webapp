41st Cong....2d Sess.
Internal Tax—Mr. Morrcll.
Ho. of Reps.
war with the best interests of the whole peo-
ple of our country, and especially accepta-
ble to British manufacturers and free-traders
everywhere. I now assert that the votes of
the Democratic members of this House have
been in strict accord with those objectionable
theories and purposes, and in opposition to the
doctrine of protection to American industry.
In the House of Representatives, February 7,
1870, Mr. Marshall, of Illinois, a Democrat,
introduced the following resolution :
"Resolved, That in the preparation of a bill for the
modification of existing tariff laws, Congress should
confine its action strictly to the preparation of a tariff
for revenue exclusively, and that the duties on no
article should be greater than that which would give
the maximum of revenue on such articles."
It will be observed that this resolution gives
no hint in favor of protection, but does favor
a tariff " for revenue exclusively." Air. Kel-
set, Republican, moved to lay it on the table,
which motion was carried—yeas 89, nays 77.
Every Democrat present, and voting, voted for
the resolution, and against Mr. Kelsey's mo-
tion.
In tiro House of Representatives, June 6,
1870, on the vote on the final passage of the
tax and tariff bill reported by the Committee
of Ways and Means, which bill provided for a
total annual reduction of internal taxation and
of the tariff on tea, coffee, sugar, molasses,
and other foreign productions, of $75,000,000,
the yeas were 153, and the nays were 35. Every
member voting in the negative was a Democrat, i!
The bill was not acceptable to them, because
it reduced the tariff on the necessaries of life,
and did not reduce it on goods and wares of
foreign manufacture.
The Democrats in Congress, the late Special
Commissioner of the Revenue, and the free-
traders of the country have for mouths de-
lighted in styling -themselves revenue reform-
ers; but when a measure:of real reform, which
reduces the burdens of taxation $75,000,000
annually, is presented and advocated by pro-
tectionists, thirty-five Democratic members of
this House vote against it. Imitating the Dem-
ocratic party itseli, these revenue reformers call
themselves by the wrong name.
To-day we are about to vote on the report of
the conference committee on this bill which so
largely reduces taxation, and the most form-
idable opposition it receives comes from the
honorable gentleman from New York, [Mr.
Brooks,] and his Democratic colleagues, who
raise their voices in behalf of the importing
merchants of New York andEnglish manufac-
turers, and against the best interests of the work-
ingmen of their own country.
