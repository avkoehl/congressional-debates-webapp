Colonel LOCKE:

Shall I abandon the position I now hold to connect with General Wadsworth who is about a half a mile on my right; he having moved up to connect with Griffin? The Fifth Cavalry not yet joined Colonel McEntee.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

It is of vital importance to hold the field where General Crawford is. Our whole line of battle is turned if the enemy get possession of it. There is a gap of half a mile between Wadsworth and Crawford. He cannot hold the line against an attack.
