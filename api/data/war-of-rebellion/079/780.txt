The general desires you to hold yourself in readiness to meet Kilpatrick should he advance against you. Call upon General Govan should you need assistance.

Should the enemy leave Atlanta to attack this army you must endeavor to destroy all stores the enemy may leave there.

Should such a movement as this be made by the enemy on a large scale this army will fall upon their rear. Brigadier-General Iverson, commanding a portion of our cavalry, with
