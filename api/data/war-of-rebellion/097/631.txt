General WEBB:

Your dispatch of 3.50 p. m., ordering me to assist General Humphreys in reference to affairs in front of Second Corps, is received, and I have shown it to General Grant, who is here, and who will direct in the absence of General Meade. The pontoon train of the Twenty-fourth Corps has been ordered up, and as soon as it is thrown I will cross and move promptly to the support of the Second Corps. Yours of 4.30 just received.*

Major-General WEBB:

I have the honor to report that the infantry of the corps has crossed the river, and are now in camp; but owing to the difficulty in fording the stream the artillery and trains are obliged to wait until the pontoon bridge is laid. My headquarters are near a small house in the vicinity of the burnt bridge and near the road.
