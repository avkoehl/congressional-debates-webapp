Lieutenant Colonel RICHARD B. IRWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Gulf:

I have the honor to inclose herewith the accompanying copy of a dispatch from Major-General Dana, for the information of the general commanding the department.* Understanding that the positions occupied by General Dana's forces on Matagorda Bay were designated by the general commanding the department, I deem it proper that I should abstain from interfering with them except under his direction. I venture to suggest the importance of early sending a strong battalion of cavalry to General Dana, or picket duty, for scouting, for protecting parties bringing wood and water, and other needful purposes.

Your obedient servant,

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General, Commanding.
