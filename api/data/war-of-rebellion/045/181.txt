York Militia, Colonel Roome, is ready to move to-day. That regiment was formerly stationed here, and could do good service in any emergency on the north side of this city. I think we shall be able to do something to-day toward organizing extempore militia.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 17, 1863-12. 30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I find it necessary to put the One hundred and fiftieth New York into Fort Marshall. That fort commands both the others and the city, and the garrison must be kept up. It would take at least 20, 000 men to hold the approaches or commanding points around the city; so in case of a raid I shall rely on being prepared to make barricades at the entrances of streets, and the local force I can raise and arm can hold them. I still doubt if the marauding rebel force which General Couch reports in Pennsylvania will visit Baltimore, though they might get near enough to make a dash. Communication with Harper's Ferry is resumed. The two regiments I sent, Fourteenth New Jersey and One hundred and thirty-eight Pennsylvania, have arrived there, and I now feel easy about the place. Milroy, whom I ordered here, returns to his troops as a volunteer, under General Tyler.

My scouts at South Mountain House, 13 miles from Hagerstown, report 100 of the enemy's cavalry at Hagerstown, and that there is no infantry on this side of the river.

General DANIEL TYLER,

Sandy Hook:

Can you give me positive and correct information of any force of any kind and number of the enemy at any particular spot? From all reports here, we might conclude that he covered all Western Pennsylvania and Maryland, or that he was no there at all. Can you give me anything correct?

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

MARYLAND HEIGHTS, MD.,

June 17, 1863-6 p. m.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

I am requested by Major-General Hooker to see to our infantry guard at Noland's and Hauling Fords. This is out of my command. Will you attend to it?

DAN. TYLER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
