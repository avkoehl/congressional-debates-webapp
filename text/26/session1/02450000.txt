gild and silver than exists «t present Every thing which we
see and hear, and feel, around us, must convine  u  all that
this is an object of the tint importance On this point,
therefore, I shall offer no aigument upon the piesent occasion
What, then, is .h* ouly possible mode of accomplishing this
purpose) It 'is a law of currency almost as universal in its
operation as any law ot nature, that paper and specie ol the
same denominations cannot circulate together W e all recollect
the celebrated message sent by Mr Burke to Mr Pitt, in the
year 1797 or 1793, that if he Co isented to the i*aue of one pound
notes, he would net ersee a guinea again The subsequent ex
penance ol England had proved the sagacity ofihe statesman,
and guineas and sovereigns were almost as completely ba
nishsd fiom general circula ion in that kingiom, as ll
ihey did not eiist After a persevering struggle ol
many years, led by their most distinguished statesmeN of both
the great political parties, the five pound nota*olicy, originally
advocatetf by the celebiated Adam Smith, finally prevailed
One pound note  were excluded from circulation, and in the
course of a very few years, it was estimated that one halfofthe
currency of that country consisted of the precious • metals
Their lowest bank note isnowot the denomination of about
twenty four dollars They have now about half and half of pa
per and specie
What is the condition of our own country in this respect?
Can our half eagles circulate together with five dollar noiea 1
That they do not must be admitted by all Will eagles ever
circulate generally in a counrty where there are ten dollar
notes issued in abundance to take their placel In those States
where on  dollar notes aie in general circulation, it is almost
as rare a thing to see a silver dollar as it is in other States,
where Are dollar notes circulate, to find a half eagle
If there ever was a question upon wh ten there had ap
peared to be an unanimous, or an almost unanimous, npinien
among oar public men of all parties, it was in regard to the
necessity of excluding from circulation all bank notes and
other paper currency of a less denomination then twenty
dollars This, a'l admit, ought to be «fleeted gradually,
aid in such a manner as to give no shock to the busi
oeas of the country , but all agree in the ultimate object
It was a favorite principle with General Jackson, and had
found equal favor with tht President of the United States My
friend from Missouri [Mr BhntosJ had presented this question
te the Senate some years ago, and on his motion we had adop'ed
an amendment, with unexampled unanimity, prohibiting the
officers of the Government from receiving or disbursing bank
notes of a less denomination than twenty dollars 1 he same
principle had been adopted in the cslebrated currency bill, and,
undents provisions, aftera certain period, the notes of no bank
which issued note* of a less denomination than twenty dollars
were to lie received in the payment of the dues to the Govern
msnt The Senator from Virginia [VIr Rive ] had made the
ab'est speech he had ever heard him deliver on this floor, in
favor of the principle of excluding from circulation notes under
twenty dollars.
Now, sir, can human ingenuity devise any mode of accom
pushing this object so much desired by ail, bht by an amend
ment ef the Constitution? If it can, I should adopt that course
I hold the Consutu ion in sui-h leverence that I would not offer
tiameiil it without absolute necessity I would app'y the
rule ol Epic peetry to its piovisions—I forget the Latin quota
Hon—and say that the power of a D vinity ou^ht never lo be in
voked without absolute necessity To use the phrase of the
Senator fr m South Carolina, [Mr Calhoun ] I can see no
mods under God's heavens of accomplishing the object but by
amending the Constitution II one Slate under'akes to make
thisrelorm, what is the consequence! Other States wi'l not
adopt ll, and their five and ten dollar notes fill up the vacuum
Hence, in self defence, those States which desire a reform, are
obliged to submit to the evils of the small note currency There
is no mode of reaching it but by proposing to all ihe states an
amendment te the Constitution, which will be alike binding on
all
If I concurred in opinion with the Senator from Massachu
setts, [Mr Webster,] that Congress already possess, the power
of regulating the currency of the States, I certainly should not
propose such an amendment His sentiments are peculiar
upon the subject, and I should be glad that he would paint out
the particular manner in which this can be accomplished It
is certainly not by the agrncy of a Bank of the United States,
because, ll such an institution should ever be re established, and
I trust it never ma/, you could only provide by its charter
that it should not issue notes und°r twenty dollars No man
will contend thai this would prevent the issue and circulation,
under the authority of the States, of notes of similar denomi
nations
Who doubts the utility of such a regulation to the banks
themselves! At present, where ih re is a demand for gold and
silver for exportation, and their vaults become exhausted, they
have no mode of replenishing them The specie necessary for
this purpose is not in circulation in the country Adopt this
amendment, and the difficulty will at once varish As the
•pecio is withdrawn from them, ths void will be supplied by
those drawing upon the circulation of the country for the ne
tessary amount Let there be a general circulation of half
specie and half paper, and the da gcrof suspensions of specie
payments will be comparatively at an end
But I promised that I should not detain the Senate long, and
I «hall no' be drawn into a general discussion of the merits of
the proposition at this stage, unless compelled to do so by the
course of other gentlemen

BIER, and BUCHANAN, (which will be given hereafier,) and
without coming to a decision on the question, the Senate pro-

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Wednesday, Februaiy 2b, 1840
The CHAIR announcedthat the subject before the House was
the i evolution reported from the Committee of Elections, to
grant to that committee the right to have printed such papers
as it might deem necessary to facilitate the business before it,
and the substitute olMr Ca\e Johni o>  therefor, in the follow
nig words
Rescind, That the Committee of Elections be authorized to
repoit to ihis House such papers, and such of their proceedings
as they may des rt. to ha\e primed by order of the House, and

Representa in es in the Congress of the United States at ihe elec
tion of 1833 in said Slate, with all ti e evidence of that fact in
their possession Provided, That nothing herein conlaintd shall
be so consirued as to prevent or delay the action of said com
mutes in takms tes'iraony, and deciding die said caso upon the
merits of the election
Mr FILLMORE proposed to amend the substi.ule, by insert
log the word 'legal" before the word "votes," and ta striko out
the word "forthwith "
Mr CHARLES JOHNSON asked Ihe gentleman from Con
necticut, [Mr Smith,] who was entitled to the floor, to give
way, to permit him to offer aresolution, which was read, for the
information of ti e House, as follows
Whereas it is alleged that the Clerk of this House, without
the authority of law, or sanction of the House of Representa
uves, did, on the 25th day of Match, and 23d day of December
last, make two several tontrai ts in writing with one 8 D
Langtree, and by which contraéis said Lang lee agreed lo fur
nish all tne stationery, and execute all the lithographing and
copperplate engraving which should be required foi the
Twenty sixth Congress, as may more fully appear by referring
to said contracts respectively and whereas it is alleged that,
in pursuance of said contract or contracts, said Langtree (who
is neither a stationer, lithographer or engraver) has furnished
and delivered to saidCLBRK, for the use of this House, a large
quantity of stationery, and has presented his bill for the same,
amounting to S19 5..1 64, and that said stationeiy, particularly
the paper, is of an inferior quality, and is charged at prices
equal to twenty percent above the usual puces of stationery
of the best quality, and by which d fference of price and quality
thisGovernment(if said hill is allowed) would sustain a loss of
more than $4,800 for the stationery already delivered, and that
if said contracts should be sanctioned by this House, and con-
tinued in force during the Twenty sixth Congiess, the Govern
ment would be subjected toa sacrifice of more than 015 000,
arising from the employment of another person to perform the
duties which the Clerk himself is requued to perform, by the
resolution of this House, parsed Match 3,1S27, ind under which
it has been the uniform practice of the Clerls of this House
to furnish the stationery, until the making of the contracts
above referred lo  therefore,
Resolved, That the Clerk of this House has no power or
authority to make any prospective contract which will require
anappropnation of moneys out or the contingent fund of this
House, or an appropriation by Congress to satisfy the same,
without the express authority of this House, anil that the con-
tracts referred to m the foregoing preamble are wholly inope-
rativpand void
Resolved nevertheless, That if the said I angiree shall (in
writing) elect to give up and cancel the said two contracts,
then, and in that event the Corn mi tee on Accounts are hereby
authoriz d to audit and allow to him his bill for s'ationery al-
ready delivered, and services performed under said contracts,
«ub|ect to such deductions as ought to be made therefrom, on
account of the quility and the prises charged therefor, and
that said committee have power to send for persons and paper?.
Mr SMITH said he could not yield the floor, unless it was
the understanding of the House that he would not forfeit it by so
doing If it was the universal wish of Ihe members of the
House, that the resolution should be considered, he had no ob-
jection to accommodate the gentleman from New York [Mr
Johvson ]
Mr JAMES GARLAND hoped the House would consent
to the consideration of the resolution, and that the investí
gation should be had He asked it as a friend of one of
the contracting parties, [the Clerk ] as an act of pistice to him,
to the'louse, and the country, that the resolution should be
passed
Objection was made to its reception, when
Mr SMITH said he did not believe he could yield the floor,
without forfeiting his right to it
Mr S then occupied the fh>or for upwards of three
houis in continuation of his remarks on yesterday and in oppo
sition to the proposition before the House, and in commenting
on and censuring the course winch bad been pursued by the
House in reference to the New Jersey ionteet
Mr FIILMORE modified his amendment to the resolution
by substitutingthe word "lawful" for the word "legal "
Mr RIVES foil.wed in reply to Mr Smith He shiwed the
great importance of the Hou'e acting speedily on the question
of who were entitled to seats from New Jersey, and to enable it
tod iso, he contended that all the facts in nosbession of the
committee should be reponed forthwith He inferred, fiom
the course of the Opposition, that it was their object to shut
out the light of tru h from the people, for the purpose of mis-
representing the facts, and manufacturing political capital out
of the same
After some remarks from Mr WELLER, which will be here
after given,
Mr CIlABB obtained the floor, and spoke in opposition to
the proposition of Mr Johvtov He considered it unprece
dente I, and very unjust to the Committee of Elections—it was
an implied cen«ure on the committee Mr C after speaking
a short time moved that the Heuse adiourn
Mr TA\ LOR demanded th  veas and nays, which were or-
dered, and were—yeas 79, nays 88
So the House having refused to adjourn,
Mr CRABB resumed his remarks for a short time, and gave
way W
Mi riLLIMORE, who moved that the House adjourn, upon
which
Mr TURNE Y demanded the yeas and nay , which were or-
dered, and were—yeas 79, nay  7 .
