treaty, as no question could now be raised here or elsewhere as
toita validity on the part of the Senate There were claim
ants who alleged that injustice had bepn done them by Mext
co, and he Was willing to lend hi-> ctgency when it could be pre
perly lent, but he was not willing to take any ¡-.tep which
mi^hto  brought up by the claimant , and insisted on, as an
obligation oí this Government to pay their claims He wanted
to see the whole ground before he would commit this Govern
ment many shape, and if appealed to him to be the wiser
course to permit this resolution to 1 e upon the table until the
26th mstant, by which time the commi^ion will have been
closed
Mr CLAY wished that th*1 Committee on Foreign Aifans
would dire t their attention to thi« subject But as
to the resolution, what was to be the result1 Whataction was
to take puce aftei the information called for shall have beui
Communicated? Ií the commission bad nof been executed ar
cording to the treaty the Execu ive might pioperly take f is
necessary steps to effect a new treaty with Mexico , but hete,
before the close of the treaty, the Senate were called upon to
draw these papets and the minutes of the board fiom the bu
reaus where they now were' Ana he would ag<un ask, for
what purpose? Nobody would think of any proposition to sa
turfy these claims out of the T easuiy What purpose was m
be answered by this call? Why, thty mieht get up a ho&iiH
«pintagainst Mexico, and, by an «cposuie oí (his transact on
by the public press, their negotiations with that power mi^ht
be materially injured With regard to the Cieole case, ceium
information in ielation to it was prematuiely called for by the
Senate, without Wditing for the action of the Executive and, by
Its being made public, presses had thereby been, in effect, in v
ted to circulate their animadversions throughout iht, countty
Was this the way that this Government could get along with
foreign Governments'?
Mr CALHOUN remarked, that while he concurred with the
Senator in the general views he had expressed relative to tur
foreign relations he considered the case of the Creole was rot
one coming within the rule he ha4 laid down In general he
Executive should act first, but in the Creole cat>e par ml mfor
mation had got abLO<±d, and it was highly necessary the
whole facts should come out in an authentic 101m There could
be no doubt that the call was well timed, and that the response
and expression of public opinion whicli followed it were calcu.
lated to strengthen the Lxecuuve m its demand for redress
Mr CLAY did not mean to íefe to the Creole case exclusive
ly, but lie thought tl at the worthy ¡senator from South Cdio
Una must peiceive there had been no necessity for the call on
the part of the Senate, before the intelligence concerning that
vessel could have possibly reached Great Britain And he ask-
ed what good could result from it in the pretent sufficiently ir
ritated relations of the two countries
Mr CALHOUN said that they had had a partial statement
of the facts in relation to the case of the Creole, and it became
desirable to have a full statement, that it might be understood by
the country at large, and he would go further, and say, that he
believed that the call was consistent with the usages of the Bn
tiah Parliament
Mr CLAY remarked that the British Parliament uniformly
refused calls for papers connected with negotiations, while they
Were pending, but this Government sometimes exposed its cor-
respondence pending a negotiation He recollected that during
the pendency of negotiations at Ghent, the most interesting pai t
of the correspondence between the two countries wag published
by the order of Congress, and it íeached there at a cutical time,
and threatened to produce serious consequences He, however,
went to the thiee British commissioners to converse with them,
and he found them very angry, but eventually he succeeded m
getting them into a good humor
Mr RIVES thought that there might be too much strictness
on one side, and too much latitude upon the other As to the
case of the Creole, he had the consolation of believing that no
detriment to the public interest was likely to result from an ex
posureof the facts which had been called foi by the Senator
from South Carolina He hid no feoit of doubt that impoitant
negotiations bftwpen independent Governments might be em
barra«sed by ndj&creH enclosures upon one side or the other,
but while this Government had been in the habit of indulging in
latitude, foreign Governments had indulged in too rruch strict
ness, they wart-, Howevei conforming more and mart- to Ame
rican Uaag0* A cas" very recently occuutd between the five
European powets, on the Turco Egyptian q es, ion, whi h was
very near kindling a war on the pari of Fiance with the other
powers All the communications which passed between he
French and English ministers, andtheu replies were commu
nicated to the Chamber of Deputies, and excited a long discus
sion Heieferredro fhx-s fact merely for the purpose of show
ing that European Governments, were becommg less strict in
such matters
Mr CLAY remarked that Fiance at that time had terminated
her negotiations
Mr RIVFcsbelievel that many of the paper  had been la d
before the t/ham tersbefoie i ie treaty was c'o p dndsomeof
them aftuw ids but they were brt ush befo e the Chambers
at a critical moirient, and while England w s *eimii a'mg a

mimicated to the Senate, which may have been addressed to

taken plaee between the Mexican Commissioners and the Se
cietary of State touching the execution of, or proceedings it n
der, said Convention, if not of sucha character as, m theopi
mon of the President, to be improper to be communicate '
He presumed that his fuenrl from Mississippi would have no
objection to the adoption of the amendments
Mr BUCHANAN said u at the unsuccessful claimants m
del the Mexican treaty could have but one of two objects n
view by pressing then claims before the Senate The nrst
was tn have the claims, against which the commissioners ha*
decided, paid out of tne public Treasury, and the second, to
ask oui inteiposition to piocure their payment from the Mexi-
can Government
In regard to the fust, he was utterly opposed to any s ep
which might even seem m the nKrt distant manner, to recofr
nise any responsibility on the pait of the Government Thei e
was no principle upon which we could be rendered liable and
he did not wish to hold out expectations to the claimants which
could never be realized
In regaid to the second, the United States h?i] negotiated n
treaty with Mexico, under which the existing Mixed Comm *,
e i on was created to d^cidejudicially upon the validity of these
claims If the Mexican commissioners had violated the treaty,
and, by fraudulent and improper conduct, had produced the
rejection of past claims which ought to have been allowed, this
was a propei subject of negotiation bythe Executive witín e
Mexican Government In such an event, it might be proper
for the Senate to ir terpose for the puipote ot sustaining fend
strengthening theExecutive m asserting the just claims of our
citizens
But wbatwa* the present condition of this judicial commip
Bion? They were about tobnngtheii labors to a close In (he
course of a few days the commissioners would have male all
then final awards for and against all the claimants Under
such encumstanrep, he was unwillirg todo any act whish
imsht interfere with the proceedings of these commissioners
Let them bung their labois to an end, and after this had been
done, then, and not till ihen, ought the Senate to act upon this
íeeolu ion He hoped therefoie, that it mieht be referred to
the Committee on Foreign Relations, to which the Senator
from New York [Mr Wright] had assented
Mr WALKER would consent either that the resolutions
should go to the Committee on Foreign lelations, or that its
consideration should be postponed and made the special order
of the day for Monday week, which would betbe day subse
quent to that for the termination of the commission He
here, in his place protested in thename ofthe Amencanciti
zens whose rights have been violated,as he believed and thought,
from the disclosures made by the partial report which had al
ready been made in íeply to a resolution of the Senate, and he
protested against the keeping of the information which had
been called for, in the secretbuieausof theExecutive Depart
ment He desired that these claimants -should be heard and so
farasitwas in his power, they should ly heard before this na
tion and before this tribunal, and he desned that, inasmuch as
a partial report of the proceedings had been already refei red to
the Committee on Foreign Relations ne part of the proceed
ings should be kept back, butthat all that thecommis<*ioners had
done and had failed to do, should be laid befoid tina body If
Senators looked to our commerce with Mexico for the last six
oi seven yeai«, they would find that it had fallen almost to
nothing, while the commerce of Mexico with other nations had
increased The exportation of specie from that country inte
New Orleans would =how the condition of our commercial
transactions with that nation In 1836, the exports of silver
were $3657,000, in 1837 «4 785 000, in 1838 SI 754 000 in 1839
«1710 000, in 1810 $1004 574 and in 1841, 8869 184 A^
what was the cause of this decrease? Why, it was because
they had failed to protect the rights of American merchants and
American citizen-*, ard because they had, in effect, torn down
the American flag within the limns of Mexico American ves
seis had been seized, property confisca'ed, andjustice made a
mere mockery The French commerce had increased with
Mexico, for the íeasmi that «she protects her sublets,, and de
mands that justice be done when an outrage is committed on
the rights and property of citizens of Trance, and if this Go
vernment permitted o lti^gfs to be committal by Mexico on
American commerce itwouli^oon go 'own t i 0,1 ms All
that he desne 1 was that th* facf-> '•hoald be aiJ befoie the peo
pie of this country, that they may know whether the Mexican
Government bad not viohted tne tieatv whether documenta
had not been withheld by Mexico, whether spuuou& and Mse
documents had been fum phed, in consequence of which iust
claims had been i ejected He theiefore moved that 'he fuuhei
consideration of the resolution be rostponed and made the order
of the day for Monday week
Mr BUCHANAN di 3 ot be! eve that O e Sena'or fiom Mis
sis ippi had done ins ice to the course of this Government m
enforcing these Mexican chums Itwastuie th it Geneial Tirk
son had iccommended reprisals against Mexico but under oui
treaty with that Government v e v,aie oblie^d before ie=or in"
to repiisals to make a formal 'ern^nd of i1! rhe claim-  wi h
the testimony insuppmf of them and if then Mexico refused to
do the c aimants justice, we misht re«ort to vir ot lepusals
Thn to be s ire wao a Ptrance provision to m-.eit m a treafj
but there it wis and we were hound bv it
In nbedietice to the treaty a formal demaV a^coidingr to its
stipulations, wi-. made on Mexico and tbi  ie&nl ed m the pie
sent treaty Wh?t moie could the Government nave donf If
the Mexican commissioners had vio ated the treaty to 0*e m
imv of ci i7ens of the Umud Stat--, this misht Viometbe
foundation of a new detnan 1 against th^ Mexican Government
When the rro eedmgs sho Id be before us wt could t len
judge whether this had been the ca*.p But what moie could
the American Government have done m the first matinee?
Fraudulent and unjust conduct of the Mexican commissioners
might render it our duty to proceed iunher hereafter, but,
heretofore, there had been nojust ground of complaint
He could assure the Senator from Mississippi tba£ he would
cheerfully unite with him at the proper timim bringing «II the
proceedings of these commissioners before the Senate Indeed
he was anxious that this should be done, and as the Senator had
agreed that his resolution might be postponed until after the
commissioneishad closed their labore, he would withdraw his
motion to refer it to the Committee on foreign Relatione.
Mr LINN said that aa this resolution would be delayed. Ka
would suggest to the Senator from Mississippi to strifes out
the latter clause of it, and peimit his (Mr Linn's) resolution
which called lor srailar information} to be passed upon at the
present time
Mr WALKER had but one wordtosay withregard to doing
their duty. If they had done their duty, their commerce with
Mexico would not now be m a fallen and dilapidated state,
whilst the commerce of other nations with that Government
had increased But while they were told that Government diel
full justice to itsciuzens, why wasitlhat their commerce had
dwindled down to nothing? He called on his friend to reraem
ber that when the treaty was presented to the Senate, he (Mr
Walkbk) protes ed against the convention, and said at the
time, that it would be followed by disaster This was not th 
measui e General Jackson let ommended, he proposed a difie
rent negotiation m his message, and that was to take the cours?
that Trance had lately pursued—at the mouth of the cannon.
If thishad been dene, they would have had no war, andthey
probably might have preced d Prance m battering down the
wal(sof the Castle of Juan de'UJJoa, and instead 01 their com-
merce with Mexico being reduced, it might now be aa large as
itever was with that nation.
Mr BUCHANAN called the recollection of the Senator from
Mississippi to the circumstances attending the appointment, by
the Government of a special mmistei to carry^out a bat of the
claims of American citizens and the testimony in then support*
and to the fact that it was not till after this that the treaty wa 
made If the Mexican commissioners have violated the treaty
and the netys of American citizens this Government should
call upon M xico for redress, and requne that Government to
fulfil its obligation according to the treaty but nothing should
be required of the Government of the United States which
would imply any right on its part to pay the claimants out of
The public Treasury If the Mexican commissioners have done
105 istice the application of this Government should be to the
Mexican Government to fulfil the treaty, but in any event let
not this Government give, by direct or mdnect action, any
sanction to the idea that the claimants are to be paid out of the
public Treasury
Mr WALKER explained He had no objection to the post-
ponement of his resolution to a day subsequent to the close of
the commission, and he acceded to the request oí the Senator
from Missouri, to omit that part of his resolution embraced m the
Senator's resolution, so as to allow the latter to be put as a se*
párate resolution
This amendment was made, and the further consideration of
Mr   Walker's resolution was postponed to Monday week.
The resolution of Mr Linn was read as follows
Resolved, That the President of the United States be re-
quested to communicate to the Senate, if not incompatible with,
the public interest, all the information m bis possession which
may relate to the recent outrages committed by the Mexican
citizens or people on the person and property of the American
Consul and other American citizens residing at ¡santa Fe and
northern provinces of Mexico
Mr LINN taid that he did not suppose there could be any
objection to his resolution being adopted His chief motive in
pressing it now was to have some action on the part of the
Senate to obtain the information called for, by the time his bill
for the settlement ol the Oregon territory should come up He
would then have occasion to show the necessity of a chain of
posts for the protection or those American citizens who trade
with Noi them Mexico The trade of this country had hitherto
been considerable with those provinces, but foi want of proper
protection on the part of this Government that trade had been
eicatly diminished, and if something should not be speedily
done, it would soon cease altogether
The resolution was then unanimously ad< pted
The bill from the House suspending so much of the charters
of the bank a of the District of Columba as pievents them
from paying out the note  of non specie paying banks, was
read a first and second time, andrefened to the Committee on,
the Bistnct of Columbia
