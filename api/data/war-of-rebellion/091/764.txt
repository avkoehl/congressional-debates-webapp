HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

Permit no trade within your district between the people of Loudoun County and the north side of the Potomac River. Seize all grain and forage in Loudoun County, and what you can't use or carry off burn up.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, December 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

Two scouts sent through Loudoun County, one of them as far as Bald Hill, near Snicker's Gap, failed to hear of Mosby. I think if he collected his men it was not for a raid across the Potomac.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadir-General.

POINT OF ROCKS, December 8, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. STEVENSON:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I left camp on the 6th instant and returned on the 7th instant; proceeded in Loudoun County as far as Bald Hill, within one mile and half of Snickersville and Hillsborough. Reported that Mosby was in the vicinity with 250 men.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. M. KEYES,

Captain, Commanding Independent Loudoun Rangers.

POINT OF ROCKS, December 8, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

I tried to cross the river but the wind was too strong.

DANIEL M. KEYES,

Captain, Commanding Loudoun Rangers.

POINT OF ROCKS, December 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

We tried two different times to cross the river with a scout but could not for the wind. The information given by citizens in and around Waterford is that they know nothing of the whereabouts of Mosby. If the wind abates the scout will go at once. There are three dismounted scouts near Waterford at the present time. I am blockading all culverts on the canal and digging pits at all fords along the line to render it utterly impossible for Mosby to get across the canal. Captain Keyes says he will find Mosby and whip him with the assistance of 300 cavalry besides his own command.

Respectfully,

B. SPENCE,

Captain, Commanding.
