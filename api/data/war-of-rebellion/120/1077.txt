RICHMOND, October 31, 1864.

General JAMES CHESNUT, Columbia, S. C.:

Governor Bonham protests against the establishment of a depot for prisoners near to Columbia. An island has been recommended as a better location, and Captain Hayden, of engineers, directed to examine it. I wish to comply with the request of the Governor if it can be consistently done. Please inquire into the matter and advise me.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, November 1, 1864.

JOHN. L. HANCOCK, Esq., President,

Board of Trade, Chicago, Ill.:

GENTLEMEN: With reference to your communication of the 20th ultimo, addressed to the President, conveying the action of the Board of Trade of Chicago, in which retaliation is suggested for the treatment of prisoners in the hands of the rebels, I am instructed to say it is hoped that the arrangement recently agreed upon between Lieutenant-General Grant and the rebel General Lee for furnishing supplies to prisoners of war, on both sides of the line, will render unnecessary a resort to the terrible means of retaliation recommended.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. H. PELOUZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
