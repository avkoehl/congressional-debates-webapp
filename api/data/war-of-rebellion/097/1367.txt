I remain of the opinion that we should confine our first efforts to getting volunteers, and would prefer that you would adopt such measures as would advance that mode of recruiting, rather than that concerning which you make inquiry, to wit, by issuing a requisition for the slaves as authorized by the statutes of Virginia.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

JEFF'N DAVIS.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your letter expressing the views of the commander-in-chief in reference to the policy to be pursued in raising negro troops is received. I am apprehensive that we shall have applications and evidence enough to take from us more men than we can well spare at this critical moment in our affairs. It seems to me that any person who has the influence to raise a company or regiment by going home could do so as well by letters to his friends at home. If I am right in this opinion an order announcing that the officers of the companies and regiments of colored troops would be appointed from the officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates on duty with our armies would have the effect of bringing back more absentees than we should lose by making the appointments. If we may judge of our future success in getting up new organizations by the past we may rely upon it that many will furnish the necessary evidence and go home and there remain for eight or ten or twelve months. I think that it would be well to publish a general order explaining more clearly the policy indicated in your letter in order that a better general understanding may exist among the parties who may desire to furnish evidence of their ability to get up new organizations; otherwise I may adopt rules which would not be as favorable to the officers and men of this command as those of other commands.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor respectfully to recommend the appointment of the following-named men to the positions of commissioned officers in the first negro organization raised under the late act of Congress: Privates G. M. Edwards and J. J. Dean, Company E, fifteenth Alabama; R. H. Skeelin, Company B, Fourth Alabama; and J. d. Patrick, Company A, First South Carolina Volunteers. The three first named of these men arrested a deserter from their brigade to the enemy, who has since been tried and sentenced to be shot on 31st instant. The last-named man detected and exposed a plot of seven of his fellow soldiers to desert to the enemy. I deem it advisable to encourage such conduct as the above by every means in our power.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
