ness and sagacity in the country sufficient to dis
tmguish bold asseition and harsh invective from
argument md pi oof Instead of an attempt to
show thxt the public interest lequned that this
publication should be made, nearly the whole
time of one class of speakers had been consumed
in whit looked vei y much like an effort to detei
the filends of the Administration fiom voting
for the amendment mo\ed by the gentleman from
New York The Republican party, and the
fi lends of the independence of the national Treas-
ury of the banks of the States, it is said, dare
not publish these documents, because they serve
to illustrate the fallacy of the pnnciples upon
which the proposed sepaiation of the Govern
ment and the banks is vindicated This declaia
tion has been made, and as often answeied and
yet it is reiterated here By what kind of reason
mg do gentlemen form and chensh this most
extraordinary opinion ? Who are the public de-
faulteis,a list of whose names is furnished m doc-
ument No IIP And when was the public money
with which they were intrusted embezzled? The
documents show that these depredations upon the
public treasure commenced immediately after the
Government was organized, and have continued
under every Administration which has been in
power The public defaulters are not then con-
fined to any one class of politicians And the fact
that public money has been misapplied by those
who had it m charge under the late and piesent
Administiations cannot, in itself, be fanly ad-
duced m support of the charge that the executive
branch of the Government is couupt, or that it
has failed to exeicise due diligence in the execu-
tion of the laws The truth is, that the source of
this great public evil can be traced to unwise le
gislation The laws intended to guard the pub
Uc money are defective The legislative branch
of the Government is justly censiuable for the
losb of a laige share of the money which has been
puiloined "1 he national Treasui y never has been
piopeily organized, and until Congress becomes
sensible of this, and undertakes coolly and delib
eiatelyto amend the existing laws instead of deal-
ing daily in wholesale denunciations of those who
have to administer them, the public money can-
not be pieseivedfrom the plunderers by any vig-
ilance that a Secretaiy of the Tieasury can exer-
cise
Monstrous as this attempt was to throw upon
the party in power the whole odium of these
defalcations, commencing with and extending
thiough the entire existence of the Government,
must be considered by all fair and impaitialmen,
it is exceeded in enormity by the pretense that
the ft tends of an independent Treasury have cause
to fear a publication of the documents illustrating
those fiauds Who, sir, are the public default-
ers? To what class of public officeis do they be-
long ? Some of them have been employed to col-
lect your revenues fiom lands, customs, and other
sources, and others have been appointed to pay
out and expend the public money in puisuance
oe appropuations made by law Does any party
in this country propose to dispense with the
agency of either class of these public functiona
lies? Has any member upon this floor yet made
such a pioposition? Let gentlemen come out and
declaie that we must have no individual agents
lesponsible to the people of the United States to
receive or disburse the public money Let them
say that the cashiers of the State banks shall ex-
ei use these functions of theTreasui y Department
Let them bring in a bill toauthonze theduectots
of cei tain State banks to appoint mdn idual agents
to collect and disburse the public moneys instead
of devohmg that powei upon the Chief Magis-
tiate of the American people, and they can then,
with someptopriety, claim to be the projectors of
a s,ystem not to be injuiioiisly affected by thedis
closuies contained in the documents they ptopose
to publish Until that is done, in the names of
justice and common sense, let us heai no moie
floud declamation about the annihilating effect of
these defalcations upon the pioposed separation
ot the Government and the banks They cannot
ictaid the piogress of that great measure m public
i          opinion, they must seive^to quicken its match
Neailvall the money which has been lost was em
bezzled win e banks weie used as depositories of
.          the public funds     Notwithstanding, those who
t          wish to letmn to that system chaige that its oppo
f          nents ai e hostile to the publication of a document
containing proof of that fact There is not the
slightest foundation foi the charge No member
has signified a wish to withhold information from
the people Tive thousand copies of the first doc
ument in the series contained in this resolution
were published at the last session It has been
scrutinized and examined It makes, all admit,
erroneous impressions, doing great injustice to
many woithy men The names of individuals,
aie upon it, as defaulters, who aie known not to
be indebted to the United States The Secretary,
in accordance with the resolution of Congress,
has sent to us extracts fiom the books of the De
paitment, showing large amounts chaiged to pub-
lic officers who have, upon final settlement of
their accounts, exhibited vouchers showing that
every dollar in their hands has been properly ap-
plied Such a document ought not to be repub-
lished No fair man ought to desire a recircula-
tion of these errors In proof of his statement,
Mi T ieftired to the name of Mi McCulloch,
late collector of the poit of Baltimore, who stood
charged with more than thirteen thousand dollai a,
although he had in his possession a Ã­eceipt fiom
the recounting officers in the Department, show-
ing that he owed not a dollar Other similar in-
stances could be adduced
Mr WISE heie modified his amendment by
striking out the document No 111 altogether, he
wanted the two others to show that, without going
one inch beyond the date of the present Admin-
istration, there had been not less than from fifty
to sixty cases of defalcation duung the incum-
bency of Mr Taney and Mr Woodbury Mr
W inquired whether the gentleman fiom Mary-
land would now vote foi the resolution?
Mr THOMAS said he could not He objected
to the publication of twenty thousand copies of
document No ^97 at any time It was very volu-
minous It contained four hundred pajes Much
of the correspondence m it was valueless, worth-
less The circulation geneially of such a docu-
ment could be of but little seivice Ihe public
money would be more advantageously employed
in the printing for distribution of one single speech
illustrating this correspondence, than in the pub-
lication of the document itself By printing it we
would furnish a luciative job to the public punt-
er and do but little service to the public interest
He was opposed, therefoie, to printing twenty
thousand copies at any time, and he would not
vote foi the printing of any number of copies now
The document is impeifect Before it is pub-
lished, we should have fiom the Seeietaiy of the
Tieasury fuither infoimation Mi I urged
similar objections to the publication of document
No 13, relating to Swaitwout's defalcation He
was in favor of lefcrnng that subject to a com-
mittee empowered to make aseaiching examina
tion into that stupendous fiaud, in all its ramifi-
cations When that has been completed, the
House could publish full information on that most
important matter, and no man, he hoped would
be disposed to oppose the pioceeding
In conclusion, Mr T denied that he and those
who acted with him desned to cover up or hide
any of these defalcations    He was prepared to
expose these plunderers of the public TreaoUiy
But he would not be forced to \oue for a resolu
tion involving a useless and extravagant expend
lture of public money, from an apprehension that
by withholding his sanation fiom such ameasuie,
he would subject himselt to unwoithy and un
founded imputations    He had the moial courige
to obey the dictates of his own ji dgment on this
or any other occasion   and he presumed that all
other members would do likewise
Mr LEGARE lose to expiess his astonish-
ment at what had fallen fiom the gentleman from
Maryland It was inconceivable to him that an v
gentleman should ha\e serious objections to the
printing of an nnpoitant public document            I
Mi THOMAS said he had no objection to the
punting of document No 297, (the correspond-
ence,) but was unwilling to vote foi twenty thou-
sand copies
Mi LLGARE said this somewhat diminished
his astonishment, tbougti it did not wholly re-
move it Eoi, without pi etending to say on whose
head the charges maue would ultim itely fall, oi
what would be the vudict of the public attei see-
ing those documents, he must, with all dut re
spect to the gentleman from Maryland, say that
he haa shown no good reason against the pt mtmg
It was to him personally a matter of profound in-
difference whethei one paity or the other would
be condemned foi their shameful depredations on
the public purse, it was of immense importance
at the present moment that all the light should be
shed on the public mind that could be brought to
beai on the great subjects before the countiy
He wat, amazed at what he had heard And was
it, indeed, true that the countiy was so fallen,
that if the Government weie administered as it
ought to be, men could not be found to fill public
offices in whom the public could confide ? He
had hardly evei listened to anything with a more
awakened mteiest than to "the vuy extiaordmary
conespondence which had been read in his ears.
He would by all means have it spiead before the
world It was the veiy thing he wanted to see.
He wanted to see whether, as soon as any laxity
or remissness waa manifested by a custodier of
the public money, he was frowned upon by the
Government, or whether its oigans bowed to a
defaulter, and treated him with criminal lenity
because he was a powerful demagogue? Were
they ready to sacrifice the pnncipies of the Con-
stitution to the inteiests of paity ' Tne gentle-
man from Mississippi had amused them all by
the manner in which he has exposed some of these
transactions, it was impossible to listen to some
things he had said, and resist the force of his
humor, but still it was a most grave and serious
matter and Mr L had left the House deeply and
painfully musing at the disclosures of official mal-
feasance which had been brought to light And
what was his astonishment to hear, at this par-
ticular moment, of all others, the principles of
economy resorted to as a reason against printing
these matteis.and sending themabioad into every
pai t of the country' Never was there an expend-
iture w hich would bettei pay for itself in the good
it would effect llus was a document, which
above all others, ought to be sent abroad on all
the winds, especially at thib moment, when anew
system was pioposed by the Executive foi the
custody of the public treasuie, and the people
were called to compaie the two schemes between
which they were, by their Representatives, to
choose He hoped the printing would be or-
dered
Mr WISE said he was desirous of saying a
few words in reply to the remarks of the gentle-
man fiom Maiyland, [Mi Tiiom&s ] Thatgen-
tlemanassumed that my object in wishing for the
printing of the Secretary's correspondence (the
most important documents among those proposed
to be printed) was meioly to show that defalca-
tions existed to a large amount
Mr THOMAS interposed to explain He had
not intended to take any such position, he then
went mto a recapitulation of the points he had
made m his speech
Mr WISE I understand tne gentleman, I
undeistand him most perfectly [should not un-
deistand him any better after he had made five
thousand explanations of his speech than I did
befoie he made it I knew that that gentleman's
pai ty instincts would lead him to oppose the pub-
lication of these documents I say this without
m ending to impugn that gentleman's motives or
his integrity I speak only of his party instincts
Modify rte motion as I may, I well know he will
ne\ei \ote for it If the gentleman had patiently
sat hete with me the other day foi six houisaixl
a half until I had pretty fully evisceiated this
document No 297,containing the correspondence
of Mi Woodbui y with his land office icceivers,
he would have found out that mj object had not
been to show, as he says, what cvei y body knew
before, viz that gieat and numeiou  defalcations
do exist, but to declare in the face of uay that, if
I had the least hope of eitln r being sustained by
this House or of getting an honest tnal in the
othtr branch, I would not wait twenty-four hours
till I filed articles of impeachment, and rely on no
. othei proof than is contained in fins document
I And I will agite iO foifeit foievtr my public sta
tion, to turn my back upon tnese halls, and never
again daie to otlei myself to the confidence of my
constituents, if on this document No 297, and on
this alone, I cauuu- convict the Secretary of the
Trt isuiy ot wiiltul and coiruut neglect and vio-
lation of his official duty And I ask, was there
Lvcr such an offer publicly made, such a challenge
ooenly pioposed, in Patliament oi Congress, in
i respect to a Cabinet Minister, without his friend
