A deserter, Private Y. T. Mann, Forty-sixth Virginia Volunteers, has just been brought to my headquarters. He says that on last Monday night the enemy withdrew a South Carolina brigade and two North Carolina regiments, of Johnson's division, from their front line. He says these troops marched from their line on battle into Petersburg and went away, but he does not know whether they were taken away in the cars or whether they marched off.
