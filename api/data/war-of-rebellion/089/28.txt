The best position for my command to do this is on the Vaughan road and about Davis' house. General Dunovant's brigade is near the Armstrong house. I will dispose my command about Davis' and on the Vaughan road.

Yours,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, October 1, 1864-10.45 a. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: As my rear guard was leaving Davis' house the enemy attacked, using artillery, and took possession of the place. I am now driving them back to regain the position and establish a brigade there.

Respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, Davis' House, October 1, 1864-12.45 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have driven the enemy back to Wilkinson's, beyond which they have two guns. The enemy have both mounted and dismounted forces. To drive them back, my force has to be dismounted. I will occupy this position with one brigade, and the other in rear as the enemy appear toward Dinwiddie road.

Respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 1, 1864-2 p. m.

Brigadier-General GREGG,Commanding Cavalry:

Your dispatch of 12.45 p. m. is received. Attack the force at Wilkinson's and develop its strength, and, if you can, drive it across the Rowanty. It is important that our whole force should engage the enemy in this quarter-that is, outside of the intrenchments. General Mott's leading brigade has just arrived here and is moving out to Parke. The whole division will soon be here, and as soon as it reaches Parke dispositions will be made to attack the enemy near the Peebles house, and the attack will be made as soon as practicable. If you can occupy an equal or greater force of the enemy than your own, and keep them from joining those we attack, it will be equivalent to joining the attack here, particularly if you beat them.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
