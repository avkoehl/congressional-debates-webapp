evening a very large fire was seen in the direction of Iuka; the distance is 20 miles. Mizner has gone to feel of them since 4 a. m. My suspicions are that some houses and stores have been burned in Iuka, the Iuka, the place abandoned, and that Price has crossed the defiles of Bear Creek, and will pass the Tennessee before it rises-at the Shoals, if possible; if not, will proceed at once to above Decatur, near Whitesburg.

General GRANT:

Am dispatching orders for Hamilton to follow Mizner's advance and hand on the skirts of Price. If you approve I will dispose to follow with my entire force, including Du Bois' command, or Colonel Chambers' regiment in lie thereof.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Jacinto, September 17, 1862.

General GRANT, Corinth:

Have just arrived at Jacinto. There will be a courier line from there to my headquarters at Davenport's Mill. As soon as Stanley comes up we shall move on to near Barnett's, probably to-night. Courier line will be open; stationers all the way down from Burnsville. Nothing new from the front. Hamilton has no doubt of Price's being at Iuka.

General GRANT:

The following just received from Burnsville:

I am going to send in a prisoner who gave himself up to our skirmishers yesterday. He gives some very valuable information. According to his statement Price is trying to draw our troops from Corinth, when Van Dorn and Breckinridge will attack that place.

Major-General GRANT:

Have ordered regimental trains and spare baggage of this army to some suitable point within the lines at Corinth, to be parked defensively, guarded by convalescents unfit for duty. March placed under the command of a responsibility officer. The sick are to go to the general hospital, where our medical director will see them provided for. I think it would be best to have a few tent-flies to be kept for each company, in view of the storms. The deserter from the rebels at Iuka is an Irishman, from Company F, Second Texas; left last night. He reports Price
