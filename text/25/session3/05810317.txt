of duties for protection and of internal improve- I
ment by the General Government, and had main-
tained that both measures weie calculated to
bind the Union together in the stiongest bonds
Nay, so far did he go as to advocate a principle
now denounced as odious and abominable—the
expediency of thenunmtum it was contended for
both by John C Calhoun and "William Lowndes,
both of them the bold and fearless advocates of
a piotective tauff Had theie ever been a single
Piesidentof the United States, fiom the days of
Washington to this hour, who had not declared
in favor of the principles of piotection ' Never
one There was no exception, from President
Washington to President Jackson In one of
General Jackson's State papers there was to be
found a most explicit and labored defense of a
protecting tariff And further the man who,
above all others, had ever been the idol of the
South Carolina party—he meant Mr Jefferson—
had used language the strongest of all in favor of
the protective policy That statesman spoke not
merely of duties foi protection, but duties of pio
tection In 181C, when the State of South Caro-
lina had been the warm advocate of a piotectne
tariff, and the State of Massachusetts had been
opposed to it—it was in that year that Mr Jef-
ferson, in his famous letter to Benjamin Austin,
of Boston, advocated a piotective tmff, and said
that the opposition to it came from " the Federal
aristocrats of the East " Then it wis that Mi
Jeffeison had maintained that the manuftctuici
ought to be placed by the side of the merchant
and the farmer, and had predicted that the coun
try never would flourish and develop all its ener-
gies till that was done Gentlemen weie mistaken
if they thought to make the people believe that
the tauff was an odious nmthem measuie Not
only the tariff, but internal impiovements, now
so totally denounced, were of southern ongin
Mr. RHETT here interposed He was per-
fectly awaie of all that But the gentleman might
save himself the trouble of referiing to what gen-
tlemen from South Carolina had said on those
subjects. Mr. R did not care one farthing what
they had said, or whether they had advocated a
tanfforno Hehadhisownopinions.and thesehe
should continue to hold and to avow, though Mr.
Jefferson, and Mr. Lowndes, and Mr Calhoun,
and all the South Carolina delegation, ay, and
Andrew Jackson to boot, had held opinions dia-
metrically opposite.
[At this point of the debate the morning hour
expired, and the subject lay over till the next
day-]                       ___
Tuesday, February 9,1839
The same subject being under consideration—
Mr BRIGGS said that at the moment when
the hour had expired the other moining, he had
been interrupted m his remarks by the gentleman
from South Carolina 1 was proceeding to show
in answer to certain statements which had been
made here by the two gentlemen from South Car-
olina, that this principle of the tariff was not, as
had been represented in that quarter, a thing of
northern origin I mentioned several distinguished
gentlemen from the South whose opinions in fa-
vor of a protective tariff and of internal improve-
ments were on record The gentleman who in-
terrupted me said that he cared not for those
opinions—that he disregarded them entirely, and
he seemed to treat with lofty scorn the opinions
of such men as William Lowndes, John C. Cal-
houn, Robert Y Hayne, Thomas Jefferson, ay,
sir, and even Andrew Jackson This may be
all so The gentleman may hold these opinions
in light estimation, but that does not alter the
fact The opinions of the distinguished states-
men to whom I have alluded are upon record, and
the gentleman cannot nullify or expunge them
They are written down by the pen of history, and
whatever may be the course of things hereafter,
there they will stand The gentleman intimated
that it was impropei to refer to such opinions in
this way They were referred to by him in no
spirit of disrespect to the gentleman who enter
tamed such opinions, for ho respected them all,
although probably some of them might have
changed their views But when gentlemen com-
ing from the same quarter of the Union and the
State of the Finances—Mr. Briggs,
same State rise and avow opinions directly op-
posite, and charge upon the members from other
sections of the Union the introduction and sup-
port of a system which they say operates un-
justly, which is a system of oppiessionand fraud,
is it inappiopiiate for the latter to allude to the
opinions coming fiom the same section of the
countiy as those who piefer such charges' Sup-
pose they are light Should it not rather lead to
forbearance in their minds towards us, that the
system ouginated with them and not with us >
But, su, the allusion to these opinions is cor-
rect and proper in anothei point of view The
gentleman from South Carolina who last spoke
declared, with all apparent seriousness,and with
his usual aidor, that the pnnciple of a protective
tariff was nevei recognized until the year 1820,
when it was applied to the aiticle of non Now,
was it not proper foi me to show that this gieat
principle had been discussed atan earlier period'
I allude to these opinions not only as rcgaided
the subject of the tariff, but also that of internal
impiovement And in addition to the names I
have mentioned, I give the name of another dis-
tinguished gentleman fiom South Caiohna who
advocated internal improvements, and who advo-
cated, amongst others, that which has been de-
nounced as being the woist of all of them—the
Cumbeiland load bill I allude to George Mc-
Duffie, who, with all the poweis of his gteat
mind, advocated appropuations for that work
and othtis This very Cumbeiland road ougin-
ated with the administration of Mr Jeffeison,
and ícceivcd the sanction of his signatuie
I will now adveit but fly to extiacts from mes-
sages of the seveial Piesidents of the United
States, beginning with the message of Geoige
"Washington, in the year 1796     He says
" Con^n  s have repeat! clly, and not without success, di-
rected til ir attention lo ihe encourI'emcnt uf dmieslic
manufactures The obj 11 of to > t, e it consequence not
toinsurp i continuance of iliur efforts m everv way which
shall appear eligible "
This is the opinion expressed by that great man
so far back as the year 1796, and yet the gentle
man fiom South Caiohna tells us that the princi-
ple of protection was not recognized  until the
year 1820
Well, sir, what further? In the year 1806, at
a time when there was a large amount of money
flowing into the Treasury, Mr Jefferson, speak-
ing of the manner in which the surplus should be
disposed of, asks-
" Shall wo suppress the impost, and Five thit advantage
to foreign over domestic inaiiuiactuies *° '
Agun m the year 1808, Mr Jefferson holds
the following language, and I call the particular
attention of my southern friends to this extract
' The situation into which v/e have hern lorced has im
pplh d us to apply i portion of our industry and capit il to
ínterin! mannlactures ind lmprovemi Ms 1 he ( \tent of
tin  conviction is daily increasing and little doubt remains
that the eatiblishmems formed and forming will, under the
auipicesnf cheaper materials and sub ist nee, th freedom
of labor from taxation with us and of protecting duties and
prohibitions, become permanent "
And yet the gentleman from South Carolina
had learned from the history of this protective
principle that it never was recognized by this Gov
ernment until the year 1820, when it was applied
to iron
President Madison, in the year 1809, says
"It will be worthy of their just and provident care to
make such further alterations m the laws as will more es
pecially foster and protect the several branches of manu
lactures which have been recently instituted or extended
by the laudable exertions of our citizens "
Thus it appears that this system now denounced
in the broadest terms by the two gentlemen from
South Carolina—and I notice this merely by way
of defense—this very principle, I say, has been
recognized from the establishment of the Consti-
tution of the United States, has been recommend-
ed, and from time to time pressed on the considera-
tion of Congress, by the distinguished citizens of
the South who have presided over the destinies
of this country This, in connection with the
fact stated the other day by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr Biddle,] that the preamble
of the second act passed under the Constitution
declares it to be necessary for the support of Gov
ernment, and for the encouragement and protec-
tion of manufactures, that duties be laid, shows
most clearly what have been the opinions of states-
Ho  off Rm$*
men from the southern portion of this Confeder-
acy Yet gentlemen rise up on this floor, again
and again, and denounce the system as_ having
originated with one section of the Union, and
founded in oppression and fraud.
The gentleman fiom South Carolina [Mr. Pick-
ens] talked about an effort to burn this pnnciple
I of protection into the Constitution To burn it
into the Constitution ' No, su, it is more deeply
fixed in that instrument. It was ingrafted by
men who framed that Constitution, and they give
their opinions in the preamble of the act to which
I have alluded.
But, sir, the matter does not rest here. So far
back as the year 1808, it was a favorite and pop-
ular topic in the South, in the Old Dominion it,
Wfts so You will find that the subject of pro-
tection to manufactures was a popular subject at
Fourth of July celebrations and at other public
meetings in the State of Virginia
Amongst other_ things of a very patriotic na-
ture, we find the'following extract from an ad-
diess issued at Richmond, Virginia, in 1808, and
signed by William H Cabell, W Wirt, William
Touchee, sr , Peyton Randolph, and Thomas
Ritchie.
" Peihaps it is no wild supposition to conceive tint even
if the present attacks upon our trade should blow over,
Congress m ly adopt the policy of encouraging our manu
factures bv rather higher dunes on imported articles of
Europi To keep ourselvesfrom being altogether depend-
ent on Lurope (or our elottung, Congress may adopt urn 
cour o ifthey should discover from experience of the inter
mediate time, that we have really the inclination and the
spirit to clothe ourselves "
Thus, (Mr B continued,) in the year 1808 was
the sentiment promulgated to the people of Vn-
gmia, by a committee of citizens formed to tak«
into consideration this identical subject, and,
amongst the numbei was the venerable editor of
the Richmond Enquirer, who now, I believe, u
not so much devoted to the Ameiican system
But I will not tiespass further in allusion to tlm
pait of the subject I said before that my re-
marks on this point were not made with a view
to reigitate the question of tanff
Mi DROMGOOLE here rose and explained
that the opinions which tlie gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts [Mi Biuggs] had indicated, were nol
the opinions of the people of Virginia.
Mr BRIGGS     I have not stated this to bj
the opinion  of Vngima  at  this  day     I  hava
spoken of past times—of that period when gen
tlemen coming fiom the same section of country
as those now most opposed to the piotective sys-
tem, were m favor of it, of those days to which
they allude as being the golden days of this Re-
public, of those days when pure American pnn
ciples prevailed through the land, of those dayi
when Jefferson and his copatuots guided the des
times  of the  Republic,  and I allude to  those
times and to tliobt men to  show that the great
principles  of protection and internal improve
ment were the great republican principles of that
dav    Sir, they are so now, and however it may
suit political or party purposes  to  raise a try
against them, they will continue to be so whilst
the pillars of the Constitution shall stand firm on
then deep foundations
But, sir, connected with this outcry is the kin-
dred charge of extravagance of appropriations
And the gentleman from South Carolina [Mi
Pickei>s] rallies his new friends, and bids them
come to the rescue to save the Government from
the consequences of these extravagant expendi-
tures And he has been so magammous as to
refer to appropriations for past years, as having
been made in total disregard of the interests of
the Confederacy Now, that there have been
extravagant appropriations, which ought to be
corrected, I am not about to deny But I have
one remark to make If such extravagant ap-
propriations have been made, they are not to be
traced exclusively to one party or the other They
cannot, with justice, be thrown by the Executive
on Congress, neithei can the majouty or minor-
ity of Congress, with propriety, be made exclu-
sively responsible for them It is said, in one
quarter, that the recommendations of the Execu-
tive have been disregti ded, and that Congiess has
gone beyond those recommendations,and appio-
pnated millions more than had been asked for
Some days since, sir, we passed appropntion
