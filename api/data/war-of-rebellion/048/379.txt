COLONEL: Major Brewer, First Michigan Cavalry, on picket at New Market, reports that he has a scouting party on a high hill 2 miles south of New Market, from which the whole country in the direction of Manassas and Bristoe can be plainly seen; that no force of the enemy could be seen save about 50 cavalry, which seemed to be a scouting party. The enemy is reported in my front (cavalry) to be retiring in the direction of Gainesville. I have directed General Custer to send a regiment to watch their movements.

Very respectfully,
