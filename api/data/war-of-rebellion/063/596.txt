Major MELTON,

Commanding Detach. Second Ark. Cav. Vols., via Cassville:

Colonel Phelps has just been ordered by dispatch to send to least three squadrons to Cassville. Remain with your command at Berryville until you hear from Colonel Phelps, as he may desire to make your force a part of the three squadrons for Cassville. General Marmaduke is reported to have crossed the Arkansas River near Van Buren on the night of the 12th instant, and to be moving for the western border of Missouri with 1,100 men.

Send a copy of this to Colonel Phelps at once, and keep up communication with Cassville.

Fit him out with the least possible delay. Advices received this p. m. from J. H. Robinson represent that guerrillas are actually going into camp on the road between Danville and Portland.
