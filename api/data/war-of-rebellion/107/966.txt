Colonel L. P. DI CESNOLA,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: General Stahel desires me to say, in answer to your communication just received, that you will probably receive instructions from Colonel Meysenburg, who has gone out on the road toward Dumfries. In case you do not receive instructions from him you will fall back this evening to Garrisonville and encamp there for the night. You will guard against a surprise, but in case of an attack you will act as the circumstances may distate. I send your communication, with a copy of this order, to Colonel Meysenburg.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. M. ROGERS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have forces scattered and very insufficient for heading him off or catching him, but will do the best I can. See dispatch to General Halleck. I suspend decision as to the telegraph line for General Kelley until this affair is over. I did not come to Washington Saturday because your permission came too late, and last night I went to Philadelphia to the marriage of one of my aides.
