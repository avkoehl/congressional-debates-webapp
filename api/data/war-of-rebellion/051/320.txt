HEADQUARTERS ANDERSON'S BRIGADE, HINDMAN'S DIV., POLK'S CORPS, ARMY OF TENN.,Near Chattanooga, Tenn., October 7, 1863.

MAJOR:In transmitting a report of the operations of my brigade on the field of Chickamauga, I take the opportunity of bringing to the notice of the major-general commanding the division the conduct of the following officers of my staff:

Captain William G. Barth, assistant adjutant-general, was constantly on the field wherever duty called or my orders placed him. In the zealous discharge of all his duties he was frequently much exposed. His horse was killed in the last assault upon the enemy's strong position, near the crest of the wooded hill from which he had repeatedly repulsed our advancing lines.

Captain Lambert May, acting assistant inspector-general, displayed his usual impetuous valor throughout the engagement till he fell from his horse severely wounded in the face. His gallantry was conspicuous and served to inspire the troops with an enthusiasm almost boundless.

Lieutenant William M. Davidson, aide-de-camp, was, as he had been at Shiloh, Perryville, and Murfreesborough, constantly by my side, ever ready, active, and intelligent in the communication of orders or the rallying of a broken line.

Captain J. B. Downing, also temporarily acting as aide, did good service in the thickest of the fight, having his horse shot under him while conveying an order to one of the regiments.

To Majors T. B. Beall, assistant quartermaster, and E. B. Carruth, acting commissary of subsistence, I am indebted for the prompt discharge of all their duties on this as well as on less important occasions.

For the display of energy, skill, and kindness by J. S. Cain, senior surgeon of the brigade, in all that pertained to his proper sphere, the wounded and the country will be ever grateful.

Privates R. R. Bradley, Company B, Tenth Mississippi Regiment, and R. M. Banks, Company K, Ninth Mississippi Regiment, my permanent couriers, also deserve my thanks for the fidelity and alacrity with they performed their parts, not unfrequently quite perilous.

I may be permitted to express the hope that the long-tried and efficient services of at least Captains May and Barth, of the number above referred to, may soon be recognized by conferring upon them an increase of rank commensurate with their merits and the age of their present commissions.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

PATTON ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major J. P. WILSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Hindman's Division.
