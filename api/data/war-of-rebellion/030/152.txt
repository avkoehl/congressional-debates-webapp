pieces, and one company of my regiment, Fifth Iowa Cavalry. I have everything else ready to move at a moment's warning, and have been so for two days. A line of scouts is established between Donelson and Henry, by which I can communicate readily in case telegraph should be cut. By this I have just received a message through in fifty-eight minutes. What few troops I have are in grand fighting trim, and everything that can be done has been done. You shall have a good account of us if attacked. The quantity of stores at Donelson is very small. I keep the bulk at Fort Henry.

RUSSELLVILLE, December 10, 1862.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff:

Scout just from Clarksville. No rebel cavalry there up to 3 p.m. Captain Johnson's company, Eighth Kentucky Cavalry, were in the town. I cannot be surprised. Pickets well out. If captured, will be after a desperate fight. If force approaching is too large will fall back on Bowling Green.
