Being a French subject, I deposited said coin the office of the French consul for safe-keeping, and had the invoice made to me by the bank sworn as French property.

The drafts I gave to the bank were drawn at four months sight, and by special agreement were not be accepted until this coin was shipped, so [as] to give me ample time to pay the same out of the proceeds of the coin. The operation was purely a commercial one, and perfectly safe and sound for me. I expected and still expect, when the coin is shipped, to make 3 to 4 per cent., depending in great measure on the price of silver in Europe at the time of the arrival of this specie.

The operation as regard to the bank was equally advantageous, firstly, in placing their coin in Europe; secondly, in giving at the rate of exchange of this, say, a handsome profit from 10 to 12 per cent., while liquidating at the same time their liabilities.

I do further swear and declare that I have never been running the blockade, or making any description of contract whatever with the Confederate Government or any of its officers, for the purpose of supplying it with arms or ammunition of war. On the contrary, I have always maintained a perfect neutrality, as I was bound to do as a French subject.

I remain, very respectfully,

EDOUARD DUPASSEUR.

MEMORANDUM.] JULY 31, 1862.

The consul of France at New Orleans, acting in conformity with the French ordinances on the subject, has received at recent times a certain number of deposits of specie, made with him by French subjects. He could not fail, in conformity always with such ordinances, to exhaust, before receiving said deposits, all possible means of information for attaining the fullest and most circumstantial knowledge about the character and origin of these deposits. Those means being exhausted, he would be exposed to serve rebuke from his Government by declining to receive those deposits in his chancery, which would have been equivalent to refusal of protectioexceptional circumstances in which New Orleans is at present temporarily placed, sufficiently explains why some Frenchmen ought to wish to place their valuables in a sure deposit and under the protection of the flag of their country.

Mr. Mejan has been called before General Butler, who has interrogated him on the subject of these deposits.

Without denying their existence he has refused to give any details in respect to them, because he did not recognize right General Butler could have to interrogate him, and because, in complying with
