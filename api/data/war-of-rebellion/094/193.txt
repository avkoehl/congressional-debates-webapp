(Received 17th.)

Brigadier General S. MEREDITH,

Paducah:

Your dispatch of this date is received. I have a force of cavalry in pursuit of Lyon sufficient to destroy or capture his command, and I have only to desire you to make use of the three regiments infantry ordered to report to you in driving away the enemy's force working at Danville bridge, on the Tennessee River, and destroy their works, if possible; the regiments will then return to Paducah and come on to this place the first opportunity.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

PADUCAH, KY., December 14, 1864.

Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE,

Clarksville, Tenn.:

ADMIRAL: Can you inform me about the movements of Lyon; has he crossed the river yet? Please answer.

S. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General.

PADUCAH, KY., December 14, 1864.

Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE,

Clarksville, Tenn.:

ADMIRAL: Please allow Captain Smith and gun-boat Peosta to remain here. I would like to send him up the rive on a reconnaissance. I am about to take the field against Lyon at Daville, and want to find out all particulars about his movements.

Respectfully,

S. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General.

CLARKSVILLE, December 14, 1864-6.15 p. m.

Brigadier General S. MEREDITH:

Your two telegrams of this date just received. Lyon understood to be at Hopkinsville. Have no knowledge that he has recrossed the river. I now telegraph gun-boat Peosta to make the reconnaissance you wish, as far as practicable, through she is wanted to convoy on the Cumberland. Captain Smith will always comply with your request when not incompatible with the duty assigned him by myself of his division officers.

S. P. LEE,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding.
