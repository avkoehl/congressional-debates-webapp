MARIETTA, GA., July 6, 1864-8 a.m.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Enemy's rear guard only on this side Chattahoochee, now holding strong intrenched position covering railroad and road bridges. Our flanks rest on river above and below, and cavalry holds right bank from Roswell to mouth of Sweet Water Creek, except just the bridge-head mentioned. Railroad will be repaired by 3 p.m. so that trains can go directly to front. Telegraph is working to General Sherman's headquarters, but is interrupted south of Dalton. Sherman expects to cross the Chattahoochee within three days. We hear nothing late from the East.
