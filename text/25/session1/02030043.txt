25th Cong.... 1st Sess.                               Making public officers depositories—Mr. Strange.            ,                                          Senate.
not been distinctly brought forward try any one, but
we well know that the anxious eyes of some of
this body are tamed to it as the panacea, the great
cathohcon, for all political disorders—as the only
instrument thiough which the country can be
saved; and we have heard as much from the gen-
tleman who has just taken his seat. But to this
measure many objections present themsebes.
Past, public opinion is, as I believe, decidedly
against it, and that, as I have already said, is
at last the test to which every act of this body
must be brought Secondly, the present Chief
Magistrate of the nation stands "solemnly
pledged against it, and must, of necessity, veto a
bill for its establishment, even it a majority of both
Houses of Congress conld be n luced to unite in its
passage, and no one has the rashness to assert that
it is to be spoken of as a possibility ihat two-thirds
of these bodies would concur m overruling the Pre-
sident's veto Thirdly, such a law would, in my
humble judgment, be m conflict with the Constitu-
tion of the United States. Tell me not that the
contrary has been settled by authority. The sim-
plicity of tnat instrument was never designed to be
marred by the comments of the learned upon it
It was intended for the perusal of the plainest man
in the country, and that he should understand it
without any farther help than a knowledge of his
vernaeulai tongue Tell me not that in piocess of
time the leadings upon it aie to be sj multiplied,
that, instead of a pamphlet of a few pages, volumes
must be lead to and out its meaning JNo autho-
rity for a United States Bank is to be found m the
language of the Constitution; and 1, foi one, will
listen to no sophistical refinements which may seek
to place it there by mfprpnee Fourthly, such an
inslitution is altogether nexpedient, and toti'ly
inconsistent with the healthful action of oui poli-
tical svsiem. As well might we expat the globe
we inhabit to pursue the orbit marked out foi
it by the hand of its Creator , should some mighty
comet come within the sphere its attraction, as
that our political system should uietly perform its
proper functions with such a magnum imperlum
within its imp\t to. There is another reason urged
with great foice by the Senator from South Caroli-
na, who sits near me, and that is the triumph which
would thus be achieved by the bank over the Go-
vernment. The attitude assumed by that Senator
in relation to this whole subject, is one of high
moral sublimit}, in which he has nobly sustained
himself, both by his mattei and his manner, md the
argument coming irom h.m, that he would not
yield to such a Urnmph ovei the Government of his
country, is an argument which does credit to the
heart which conceived, and the lips which ut-
tered it.
The second plan is the one proposed by the Sena-
tor from Virginia, to which he will not find manv
supporters ftom any real regard to the plan itself,
and if he succeeds in procuring its adoption, it
must be through the instrumentality of those into
whose motives it does not become me to inquire.
But as that Senator has addressed his old friends,
he will allow me in their name to address him in re-
turn, and to wain him that when wifhtoieignaidhe
shall have succeeded in beating down his old allies,
it will not be long ere he will heai the shout of tri-
umph from the maible palace at Philadelphia.
"We would  ladlj, if we could, make common
cause with him unon the ground he has assumed,
bul belie\ nig it untenable, w e have rctieated w nh-
in the ramparts of the Constitution, and should
they be battered into fragmentsabout ou* eats, and
we ourselves piostrated and -vanquished, we will
still cry out "Live the Constitution' live the Re-
public1" I have ^aid to the Senatoi fiom Virginia,
that we think his ground untenable, and now pro-
ceed to offer some of the íeasons for our so be-
lieving. " Thou hast been weighed in the halance,
and found wanting," was a portion of the sentence
written by the fingero of an unseen hand upon the
wall, against the King of Babylon, which caused
that monarch's knees to smite togethei, and the
sounds of guilty tevelry to ceass, and with great
emphasis may we address tho same language to
the deposite banks. This the Senator from Vir-
ginia denies, and insists that the experiment has
not failed.    What would that Senator call a fail-
ure1? Does he require that their buildings should
be razed from their foundations, and made an
heap, and that their piles of paper money should
be committed to the flames, belore he will acknow-
ledge that they have failed' When a merchant in
any mercantile community neglects to meet his en-
gagements with punctuality, who pretends to ques-
tion his failure1 But these banks have not only
failed to meet their engagements, but have
flatly deolaied then determination not to meet
them until it suits their own perfect conveni-
ence. What has brought us to our piesent
condition, but leaning upon these broken reeds?
but imprudent confidence in these faithless
agents' Should we have experienced any difficulty
m meeting our fiscal engagements if they had, in
fulfilment of thens, promptly paid up the drafts of
the Treasury upon them' Would the merchants have
found any difficulty in paying up their duty bonds,
had the banks, by redemption of their notes, pre-
served to them a found currency in which to com-
pl> with their obligations' The application of the
merchants for indulgence is baspd upon the ground
that their inability to make payment is entirely
owing, not to the want of funds, but of such funds
as the Government would be willing to receive.
Wheie i  the individual who, having trusted a pri-
vate banker with his funds, would trust him fur-
thei, after his suffering draft aftei draft to come
back dishonored, declaring publicly that he had
the money to pay with, and justly owed the debt,
but that he did not think it his interest to do so,
not would he do n, unless his deposito would
make arrangement* with all persons in whose fa-
vor he should draw, to take the banker's own notes,
and coiuidei them a*- payment' Motives of friend-
ship 01 of pohc", 01 facility ol di-po ltion in a pri-
\dcindi ulua1, might indue" a contioui'ice of 'ht
trust, «flu i1 ha 1 be n thus abused, up m piopei
concessions, and a reasonable assurance that faith
would thereafter be kept But are the depositories
of a nation's faith—the trustees of a nation's wealth
—to be moved by such considerations to lend a
credulous ear to such piomises' We have had such
promises already, and have we any security
that they will m future be more faithfully kept'
Have not the banks pleaded the tyrant law of ne-
cessity to excuse their fault, and will necessity
he less impenous in future than we find it now'
It is folly to exppct it But while the Senator from
Virginia is m one bieath denjmg the failure of the
banks, 11 the next he is offenng apologies for that,
upon the existence ol which he is vainly striving
to close his eyes He attributes it in the first place
to some great mysterious, convulsion, which he
does not attempt to define, and which he assuies
us is never likely to occui again Next, he refers
to the deposite law and the specie order, as furnish-
ing sufficient apologies for most eccentric move-
ments in the pecumaiy affairs of the country.
But chiefly he imputes the failure of the banks to
the withdrawal of the confidence of the Govern-
ment, and insists that its restoration is all that is
wanting to set all things right But ho , I would
ask, is confidence to be created wheie it does not
exist' Like love, aad hope, and fear, it must be the
spontaneous offspring of the bosom it inhabits.
As well might the assassin, in a paroxism of peni-
tence, seek to rekindle the spaik of life in the body
of his victim, as this oi any othei legislative body
to restore confidence to existence, after it has been
murdered, either tbiough accident or design But
grantthatweeouldb} the fiatofthis Legislature wake
up confidence to renewed existence m the bosoms
of the people, ought we to do so, when we ourselves
have not confidence' Would it not be a legislative
fraud' Could we say to them, You ought to have
the most implicit confidence m these banks as per-
fectly sale depositories of \ our wealth, as sound le-
gulalors of the comma cial affairs of the country,
as prudent cuculalors el paper which they have at
all times the power to redeem, unless we ourselves
felt this confidence' And do we feel it' I for one
must confess that I do not, and would be putting
my signamre to a solemn falsehood were I to say
that I did The Senator declares that the only lea-
son why specie payments were maintained m Eng-
land and suspended in this country, is, that m the
one confidence was sustained by the Government,
and i|i the other prostrated. I have no hesitation in
admitting that, but for the failure of confidence,
the banks in this country could have maintained
specie payments longer, and that the failure of con-
fidence must necessarily precede the stoppage of
specie payments. But the true question is not
whether confidence existed or not, but the causes
of its failure or continuance Now it is manifest,
as I conceive, why it continued in Eng'and, and
perished in this country; not, as the gentleman sup-
poses, by reason of the different action of the two
Governments, but on account of causes which had
passed beyond the reach of control from either
Government.
Nature, b> mysfenons and immutable laws, has
connected canses with their effects, and one is fol-
lowed bv the other with all the certainty of the re-
volving year, and he who finds a cause adequate
to the production of a given effect followed by
that effect, may fearlessly conclude that the latter
is the offspring of the former
It is equally a rule of sound philosophy, that
nothing which does not m if  rature appear ade-
quate to the production of a given effect, is to be
taken as its cause however immediately it may pre-
cede it Now what art of the Givernment was
adequate to the destiuction of confidence' The
most that can be said is, that some of its acts may
have been calculated to enfeeble, but Hot one can
be pointed out adequate to its destruction But
there are tuo causes immediately before us, suffi-
cient, as I think, to account for the different effects
upon confidence in the two countues when alarm
was exci'ed The first is, that England was a cie-
ditor conntrj, and this a debtor country. The
debtor could nevei draw from the creditor against
h s will, while the creditor had a right to draw upon
tt\p debtor to the u'lermost farihmiol h s indeb*ed-
n"ss. Who, therefore, alaun was cic.ied, the
Bank of England had noihmgto fear but from her
own citizens; while m this country, the banks were
threatened  ith a drain from England as well as
from then own countrymen. Standing as a credi-
tor, the Bank of England was receiving more
than she was paying out, and every day
hei situation was continually growing better,
and if she was able to meet the engage-
ments of to-day, she would be still better able to
meet those of to-morrow Not so with the Ameri-
can bank , theirs would be drain without replenish-
ment, and looking before them to a vast chasm
yaw uing for the reception of their --peeie as fast as
they could tell it out, despiir seized upon them,
confidence expired, and tley refused to engage in a
work m the accomplishment of which they must
perish. Grant, say thev, I am enabled to meet the
engagements of to-day; those of to-morrow will be
still more numerous and importunate. The balance
of trade will give to our riches wings by which they
must fly acioss the Atlantic, and be no more seen.
We will take our stand at once, then, and not vo-
luntarily pour out our own life-blood, but if it is
taken from us, l*-t it be by some slow and lingering
piocess which will prolong our existence until some
providential or fortuitous circumstance may inter-
pose to save us fiom •"esiiuciioi. What more
could be desired t« account for the different course
of the banks on the two sides of the Atlantic' Bat
yet there is another circumstance, which, as a co-
operating cause ivith the other, doubtless precipi-
tated the stoppage of specie payments m this coun-
try, which had no existence, and consequently,
could have no action, on the othei side oí the
water The Bank of England is, alone—an unit,
an autocrat Sh<> had but one will to consult, and
that will could act at the critical moment when its
action might be necessary She could continue to pay
out her four millions of specie until the last mil-
lion was invaded, and then, if she thought it expe-
dient, conld cry " hold1 enough1" But the banks
in this country were legion, with them it uas a

stiuggle for soecie, might exhaust its stoi % and
