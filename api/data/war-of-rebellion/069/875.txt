FLAG-SHIP VIRGINIA,

Chaffin's Bluff, June 4, 1864 - 10 p. m.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Hancock's House:

I propose, if the Secretary of the Navy shall consent, to place heavy navy guns in your unoccupied works at Howlett's, and to man them entirely from the navy. Will you be able to protect them from the land forces of the enemy? Please reply as soon as possible.

JOHN K. MITCHELL,

Commanding James River Squadron.

DREWRY'S BLUFF, June 4, 1864.

Major JOHN M. OTEY:

The following is General Bragg's dispatch:

Send up immediately by steamer Captain [Lieutenant] Barry, who commanded the iron-clad gun on York River Railroad in 1862, with detachment of skilled artillerymen to serve piece.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

Lieutenant Barry is with Captain Kevill's company, detached from this post by order of the commanding general. Colonel Waddy will probably know their whereabouts. The best artillerymen are in Captain Kevill's company.

G. H. TERRETT,

Major, Commanding.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

Two large bodies of dust were observed yesterday morning down toward Bermuda Hundred. By some mistake in the office this was not sent to you last night. Nothing to-day so far.

Three monitors, one large and two medium-sized transports, and three tugs are lying together just below Howlett's. A mile lower down the masts of two gun-boats can be seen above the trees.
