APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....3d Sess.
Northern Frontier—Mr. Bronson.
Ho. of Reps.
Executive in respect to that matter I understand
the gentleman fiom Tennessee to charge that the
Administration are mainly in fault foi the unfor-
tunate events which have taken place on the north-
em boidei, in which our own citizens have been
engaged, and that it has been owing principally,
jf not entirely, to the want of prompt, energetic,
and efficient action on the part of the Executive
of oui Government, that our own citizens have
taken pait in those troubles, and that the spirit
which has been manifested by the border mliab-
Hantsm relation to the Canadian difficulties would
have been speedily and easily suppiessed if the
Piesidenthad taken early and decided giound on
the matter Sn,the gentleman could not have
been led into a gieater erroi, respecting the con-
duct of the Executive, and I appiehend he has
not well remembered the lustoiy, or examined
the documents, in reference to these matters, or
he could not have fallen into such a course of
argument
I recollect, some time ago, when this House
was m Committee of the Whole, to have heard
the same charges substantially fiom the honoia-
ble gentleman fiom Tennessee, and, in alluding
to the appropuations which had been made for
the protection of the northern fiontiei, and which
be stated at <¡,l,000,f¡00, (but which I believe were
only $625,000,) the honorable gentleman insisted
that " evei y cent of that expenditure might have
been saved to the nation,if thePresident, instead
of tempouzing and waning-to see what public
sentiment would be, and suffering the feeble pioc-
lamations of the Govetnois of the States to go
forth as a substitute for his own, had, upon the
fust indication of distuibanccs in that quaitei, is-
sued such a proolatmtion as he did in November
last," and the gentleman added, that " that did
not suit the policy of an electioneering Adminis-
tration, it was hazarding quite too much to take
ground in advance of public opinion," &c
These charges are, in my opinion, wholly un
founded in fact, and I shall endeavoi to show to
this House, and to the honorable gentleman from
Tennessee, that they are so     Why, sn, so far
from there being any want of prompt action on
the pait of the Ptesident, or any hesitation as to
the course which lie should puisue, the truth is ,
that he did, at tne earliest moment, take giound, '
openly and decisively, respecting the inteiference |
of oui own citizens with the Canadian troubles,
and that, fiom that moment, the couise of the Ad-
ministiation his been uniform and unceasing in
endeavoring to ptevent any violations of oui laws .
and treaties, and to piescivo our neutrality by
every means in us power,and by all lawful means
to restiam oui citizens fiom a piiticipationm the 1
affairs of then Canadian neighbors
Without i ecui i ing to facts notoi lous, and within
the knowledge of every citizen on the fiontier, I
beg to call the ettentionof the House to the docu-
ments which have been punted and laid upon oui
tables, and which show what action the Execu-
tive his taken on this subject As eaily as the
7th of December, 1837, and in the veiy ou set of
the troubles in Lowei Canada, and bcfoie any
difficulty had ansen in Upp i Canada, the Secie-
tary of Stati, by the dueetion of the President,
addressed cucuiars to the Governors of Veimont,
New York, and Michigan, and also to the Tjmted

And on the 9th December, 1837, a circular was
issued by the Secretary of the Tieasui y to all the
collectors on the frontiei, in which, aftei reciting
the foregoing instiuctions given to the district
attorneys, the Secretary of the Treasury says
" By a similar direction, you and your officers are re
quired to cooperate with the district attorneys, and other
United Stares officers, m all legal modes to a «1st them in
the accomplishment of the objects befoic stated "
Thus far there had been no paiticuHr overt act j
on the pait of oui citizens, which called foi, oi
would justify, any more active or decided mtei-
feience on the pait of the Geneial Government,
but late in December the gatheiing took place on
Navy Island, winch was finally followi d by that
atiocious outiage, the burning of the " Caiohne,"
and on the íeceipt in this city of tne news of that
affau , and of the movements consequent upon it,
which was about the 4th or 5th Jai uary, 1838, a
pioclamation was immediately issued by thePies-
ldent, in which, after a preamble noticing the state
of affans on the frontiei, &c , the pioclamation
concludes as follows-
Now, therefore, to the end that the authotity of the laws
may be maintained, and tile faith of treaties ob erved, I,
M irlin Van Buren, do most earnestly exhort all citizens of
the United States who have thus violated their duties, to
leturn peaceably to their respective home- and I hereby

By the Tre«i lent
Jottv I orsyth, Secretary of State
This pioclamation, it will be observed, (which
be us date the 5th January, 1838,) contuns, in
substance, the same sentiments which w eie after-
ward"? íeiteíated in the pioclamation of Novem
ber last, and, though not in the same words,yet
it does as clearly and distinctly indicate U e ground
which the Executive intended to take as does the
pioclamation of November, and if that was suffi-
ciently explicit to define the position of the Ad-
mimstiation, ceitamly tins one of Januaiy was
equally explicit I appiehend the gentleman had
overlooked this pioclamation when he charged
the Executive with bein^ governed by election-
eenng motives, and unwilling to hazard anything
by taking giound m advance of public sentiment
Sir, if the Admmistiation had been governed by
such motives as the gentleman fiom Tennessee
imputes, no such pioclamation would have gone
forth, and particulaily at that time, when the
national feeling and national honor had been so
outraged by the atrocity before alluded to An
"electioneeimg Administration" would have
" tcmpoiized" under such cucumstances, and
in view of a speedily appioaehmg election on that
fiontie , and.bysodomg.mighthaveeompiomit

tiation can be chai si d with so temporizing, Ileale
for the House to jidsi At the same time Jiat this
proclamaron of the 5th of Janaaiy was issued,
Geneial Scott was sent to that frontier, furthei
circuláis were issued by the S"cietary of Wat to
the Governois of Vermont, Michigan, and New-
York, reitcating the views and d< signs of the
President winch had been previously oxpiessed,
and requesting them to aid the Geneial Govern-
ment in enfoicmg the obligations of neutiahty as
well as to íepel invasion, and to call out the mili-
tia of the States if necessaiy
I might go on accumulat ng evidence upon evi-
dence, and fact uponfict, to show that nothing can
be more unjust than the charge that the Adminis-
tration did noteaily and distinctly take ground
upon this subject,andsuchgiound, too.assuited,
not the policy of an ckclioneenng JUimmstialion,
but the policy of an Administration willing and
anxious to maintain the interests and honor of the
whole nation, and the documents which I have
quoted, as well as the whole history of the affair,
when examined, will show most conclusively that
theie was no shrinking fiom duty on the part of
the Executive, that in advance of public sentiment,
and in the very outset of the Canadian troubles,
the President took the earliest and most efficient
means which were in. his power to restrain our
own citizens from any unlawful interfeience with
those tioubles Ti e citizens of the ftontiei were
not unadvised of the real intentions of the Presi-
dent, or kept in the dark as to Ins views on this
| impoitant subject, they were plainly put foith in
| the proclamation of the 5th of January,and if the
honoiabie gentleman fiom Tennessee had been
¡i upon the frontier, or at all acquainted with the
1 history of things theie foi the last twelve months,
he would have known, as evciy man there does
know, that the early and decisive action of the
Pi esidentandofthc executive officeis of the United
Siates on that fiontiei, was not only well known
and openly avowed, but that, in consequence of the
position taken by the Piesidcht, m consequence
of the duty which nccessaiily devolved upon the
1 Executive of seeing the laws faithfully executed,
the administration of the General Government,
i as well as the administration of the goveinment
I of the State of New Yoik.upon whom a like duty
devolved, were thrown into a position antagonist
to that class of citizens which had taken an inter-
est in favor of Canadian indepi ndence, antago-
nist to the " Canadian patnot"mteiest,if I may
so call it, and it is well known that geneially,
along the whole fiontiei, that interest, so far as
any political bias was e;iven to it, was decidedly
against the Administiation paity in the late New
Yoik elections
I might refei to the newspapers in that mteiest
for proof of this fact, and in answei to the hon-
oiabie gentleman from New Jersey, [Mi Ran-
dolph,] who ref rs me to the fact mat he saw a
num.bet of Mackenzie's Gazette, in which the
cditoi sustained the Administiation party in the
Stite of New York at the lute elections, I would
lemaik that no doubt he did, that Macl enziedid
uige his follovveis to sustain the Administiation
ticket, but, at the same time, and in some of the
same papéis, he openly denounced the course of
the Piesident and some of the executive officeis
on the irontiei, ana it is a well known fait that
the stand taken by the Admin stiation n this
matter, has not only been unsatisfuctoiy to the
" Canadian patuot" inteiesi, but by many in that
interest has been openly denounced, and that, aa
a necessaiy consequence, in the last elections on
the fiom eis, the fnends of the Admnust a ion,
oi that paity as a paitv, lost stiength and influ-
ence fiom this caus to what extent, I will not
now undertake to say, but to some extent, and
that not inconsiderable, is beyond all contiov ersy
Mi REED mquned whethei the collectois on
the fiontiei had done then duty, oi whether theie
had not been complaints against them for partici-
pation in Canadian ufTaiis '
