DEAR GENERAL: Inclosed you will find several reports from the front.* Advances seem to have been made on all the roads, but none of them in serious force. My scout that was out on the Purdy road last night is in. He brings a prisoner,and reports killing 3 men last night. His report is quite intelligent, and corroborative of what we know-the enemy's main force being within 6 miles and mostly on the Monterey road. None west of the Purdy road. The indications and accounts of sickness with the enemy are strong,&amp;c.

Yours, truly,

BRAXTON BRAGG.
