APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
Sept. 1841.
27th Cong""1st Sess.
Fiscal Corporation—Mr. Berrien.
Senate.
mhis official communications to the Senate These
were, in my judgment, calculated to show that the
institution which it is the purpose of this bill to
establish was conformed to the recommendation, of
that officer, in his t pewmg message to Congress,
and that the faculties with which it is proposed 'o
invest it were even more limited than tht*e con-
tained in the protet submitted by the Secretary of
the Treasury, with the approbation of ihe Presi-
dent. Then, as now, that piper was understood (o
be, as it undeniably was, the result ot the delibe-
rate and anxious consideration of his constitutional
advisers, ratified and approved by himself. Un-
less, then, the views ot the Executive h d under-
gone an entire change, of which, in the long inter-
val wh ch had been emplo3ed in the discussion of
the measure, he had failed to advise us, (and of
which change, if it had occurred, speaking with
perfect respect, bu' looking to his previous offical
communications, we had just righ  to expect that
he would hive advised ««,) I «aid then, an 1 I re
peat now, mat the bill under consideration is ca-
culatcd to receive his sincum I exoressiy ex-
cluded all reference to the rumors c t the day, and
hmiteá myself entirely to the recordad e-¡(>r= sioi
of his opinions, as these were disclosed on the jour-
nal of the Senate. p, howevei, we may for a mo-
ment extend tar view, snd seek niformition from
a source which the Senator from New York [Mr
Wright] hascharaeteiisedasrmcial—!r<m a daily
journal which that Senator has designated as ili°
official organ of the Aimtnistralion, and the au-
thonz d expositor ot i's View —wesha'l fim' ample
confirmation of the assertion which I have made
It will be recollec ed that the bill which wis re-
ported by the Seizor from Kentucky pr ipo'ed the
establishment of a bank of dis ou it and dtjosie
with the privilege, also, ofdea'irg in bill- of ex-
change. It wa% this powfr of local di (i.unt, to
be txercbed in the several S ates, wt h or without
their consort, whicM fo mel the ground ot ihe Pre-
sident's i bjection to that bill I hold in my land
a number ot that j ureal, c ntaining .>u eo tonal
article on the first veto ot the Prt t'en , from
which I des le to read ihe following oxt ict The
water is discu sing the question of ihu pou rs wnh
which it i necessaiy lo mve t a Bank of ihe Unit d
Slate, to qualify it to cor duct the fiscal operations
of the Government, and he says

Finally, Htier hi vmg shown, as he supposes,
that the discounting power is not necessary to a
Bink, the wnipr concludes thus

And now, sir, I KdJiess myself io the arenment
of tho Senator from Pennsyivann, [Mr Bocha
nan ] In the observations winch I submitted ti
the Senate on i pemng this d¡*cus ion, I endeavori d
to deduce from the power to lay and collect «axes
the right of Congress to crept? a e^rp"ra ior>  and
to invest it with the faculty ot c ah"g n exchange,
which this bill proposrs.    Ba I   p d f rtner   t.iat
this right rai^ht also te derived from the c >mmer
cial  power—the pow«   to  regulate fceign com-
merce and that between ihe save i' S a'e-.   I c n-
ten'ed  myself with stptmg this p s, ion, expressly
disclaiming any intention of ar mug if, and I did
not argue it.    It «eem* sir, 'h t ihe in imation of
this opinion ha? affected  the S^n-Hor from Pein-
syWania with the u mo¡,t surprise    I am, s<~ fat as

nately  for me, in  the person jf r*a  'nuividual
who men occupied a distinguished pjs t on here,
and that opinion was encoun ertd at th" instant
by the Senator from   Pennsylvania in  an ai-gu
irent ii   which   he   congratulates   hii¡self  with
having   the  concurrence   of   tie  Senior  from
Kentucky, [Mr  Clay]    Sir,  it v/\, a ju^t sub

wheh it is empowered by the Consittu <m to 1?
guíate. But this goes beyond whi'w>s nece spry
to show the fallacy  of the  proposaion. agatnst
which I am contenimg That piopos tton i , that
C ngi-ess has no right, under th  commercial
power, to create an instrument wh eh 13 necessary
to that commerce wmch if is empowered to regá-
late, however indispensable that instrument may
be to its regu'atton. No ore doubts hat a sound
currency is thus necessary to a wed regulated
commerce Bu' if the right to regulate is, as that
proposition asserts, to be limited to the arrange-
meit of the existing ns rumems of commerce, and
cannot be extended to the eieii n of new ones,
whence does Corgre^ ditive the power to build a
hgbt-housi or beacons, to put down a buoy, or to
erect a pi t? Can it be t-«ccd to any other 'ource
>h n the constitutional grant of poner to regula'e
coram >rct? Thus then s r, I venture to presume
tnat the op mon whic" 1 have expressed, rare as it
may te, and opnosed as it unhapp ly is to the high
au'hon y ygainst wh ch I am con endiag, is ne-
vertheless demonstrated.
But I havt said that the proposition of the Sena-
tor from Pen io) lv£.ma was not only untenable, but
that 11 w as also map', that it doe  not meet the po-
«itiinitw s in ended to annihilate. The opinion
whiuh I have expressed does not lequ re meto
prove that Congrí s , under the commercial grant,
ha* the power to creat  a currency. Congress does
pos ess that power, but d°riv s >t from a differeat
grant The po /er «h ch his bill pr p ses to call
' o exercse is not the crea'ion of a new currency,
bat the lególa 101 ot ?n existing one L doe^, in-
deed, author ze the corporation to i sue ns own
notes, bat tae=e w 11 f rm a small potuon of the
