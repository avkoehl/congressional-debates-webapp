IUKA, May 30, 1865

Major-General THOMAS:

Do you wish me to do anything to save the Confederate cotton now scattered through this country south of me? It is in very bad condition; wants rebagging.

E. HATCH,

Brevet Major-General.

NASHVILLE, May 30, 1865.

Brevet Major-General HATCH,

Iuka:

General Thomas does not desire you to do anything to save the Confederate cotton; the Treasury Department can look after it if they think it worth while.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Major-General STONEMAN,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

The capture of Champ Ferguson and surrender of his guerrillas render General Rousseau's expedition unnecessary and it will not start. Yours will, however, go on.

A Mr. Chapman is here on the part of the people of North Carolina and desires the permission and assistance of the United States Government to transport salt from the salt-works in Virginia to North Carolina, via Greeneville and Asheville. He asks use of the railroad and Government teams. Have I anything to do with it, and can he have the assistance asked for?
