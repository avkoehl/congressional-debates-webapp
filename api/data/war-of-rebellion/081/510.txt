Brigadier-General FERRERO,Commanding Division, Ninth Corps:

I am instructed to inform you that General Gibbon is ordered to move up to the left of the Second Corps, General Wright having been ordered with his whole corps to Reams' Station to support General Wilson, who finds the whole force of the enemy's cavalry concentrated there to prevent his return. The commanding general directs that you hold your command ready to move up to Prince George Court-House and extend to General Gibbon's vacated position. General Gibbon had a brigade near Lucas', on the Prince George Court-House road, and one near Westbrook's. His picket-line ran from near the plank road past Sturdivant's Mill, across the Norfolk railroad near Well's,&amp;c., connecting with yours on the left near Birchett's. General Sheridan, who is moving up from Wind-Mill Point, is ordered to proceed to Reams' Station. We have cavalry pickets down the plank road.
