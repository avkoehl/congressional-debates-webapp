to-night from which I hope favorable results. They may have the effect of drawing the enemy back from Maryland. I am also sending the Nineteenth Corps and five or six veteran regiments of cavalry to Washington.

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, July 26, 1864-11 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

In view of the return of the enemy with re-enforcements, as stated in dispatches which have been sent to you, General Wright has moved out this morning on the Rockville road toward the Monocacy, to form a junction with Hunter at such point as the latter may direct. The Sixth Corps is reduced to a little over 11,000. With the detachment of the Nineteenth Corps and from here he will have, in all, about 19,000 including cavalry, which, being made up of fragments, is not very reliable. To give General Wright any cavalry at all it was necessary to retain the detachments which your ordered back to the Army of the Potomac. If Early has been re-enforced, as stated from several reliable sources, Hunter and Wright will not be strong enough to meet him in the field. I therefore submit to your consideration the importance of sending a force large enough to prevent his again devastating Maryland and Pennsylvania. All information we receive is immediately telegraphed to you.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., July 26, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

General Crook's dispatches indicate the probability of another raid north by the enemy. It takes a long time for dispatches to come here and go back, during which conditions may change; consequently it is absolutely necessary that some one in Washington should give orders and make disposition of all the forces within reach of the line of the Potomac. No force has gone from here to re-enforce Early, unless it may be old regiments. Deserters come in very day, enabling us to keep track of every change the enemy makes.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 26, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I am ordering forward the Nineteenth Corps. Several thousand will embark to-night and early in the morning.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
