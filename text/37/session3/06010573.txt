So the motion was not a^reul to.
Mr. MALLORY. I rise to a privileged ques-
tion. 1 oiler a joint lesolution, which the Clerk
will read.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state
the nature of his privileged question before any-
thing is read.
Mr. MALLORY. It is a joint resolution pro-
viding for the adjournment ot Congress on a spe-
cified day.
TiieSPEA KER. The House has decided that
that is a question of privilege.
The resolution was lead, as follows:
IlcsoJc-'d. (the Senate '-oncum ins.'l That when the House
adjourn- it adjourn to met t on the 3d of Mar< h next.
Mi. VALLANDIGHAM. I move to amend
the resolution by inseitmg the 5th day of-March
next.
Mr. MALLORY. I demand the previous ques-
tion.
j The previous question was seconded.
Mr. COX. I call for the yeas and nays on
ordeung the main qui stion.
Mr. SARGENT. 1 call for tellers on the yeas
and nays.
Tellers were ordered; and Messis. Mallory
and S. C. Fgssexdex were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
ayes S3, noes 3.
So the yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. HOLMAN. I rise to a point of order. It
does not appear, from the vote just taken, that
there is a quorum present. I therefore demand
that there shall be a call of the House.
The SPEAKER. It does not require a quorum
to order the yeas and nays. They are ordered by
one fifth of those present.
Mr. COX. Is it in order to move a call of the
House ?
The SPEAKER. Not at this time.
Several Members. Call the roll.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the rule
on that point.
The Clerk read as follows:
UA call of the House shall not be in order after the previous
question is seconded, unless It shall appear, upon an actual
count by the Speakci, that no quorum is present."
Mr. HOLMAN. I submit that, on a count, it
has'heen ascertained that there is not a quorum
present.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state again
that it only requires one fifth of the members
present to order the yeas and nays.
Mr. HOLMAN. I appeal from the decision ot
the Chan on that ruling.
The SPEAKER. The Chair makes no decision
on that point. The yeas and nays are ordered by
the Constitution.
Mr. HICKMAN. I rise to a privileged ques-
tion. £
Mr. HOLMAN. I made the point of order
that, it notappearmg by count that there is aquo-
rum present, there should be a call of the House.
The Chair decides that it is not necessary that
there should be a quorum present; and I appeal
from that decision of the Chair.
The SPEAKER. The Chair has not counted
the House.
Mr. HOLMAN. I desire to state my point of
order distinctly. It is this: that, on a count by
tellers, it appears there is not a quorum present; I
therefore move a call of the House.
Tim SFEA KER. The Chair has already stated
that, in parliamentary proceedings, it does not
require a quorum to ordei the yeas and nays.
Mr. HOLMAN. The Chair overrules my mo-
tion for a call of the House. It is from that de-
cision thai I appeal.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. We have a right
to appeal fiom that. The Chair decides the mo-
tion to be outof order; and from that decision we
appeal.
Mr. COX. As there is some doubt about the
point, I move to lay the appeal upon the table.
I Hunk the point is very doubtful.
The SPEAKER. The Chair has not received
the appeal yet.
Mr. ALDRICH. Too late. [Laughter.]
. The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Indi-
ana [Mr. I {oi mam] moves that there be a call of
the House. The Chair decides that, in this case,
the motion is not, in order under the rules. From
lhatdecision the gentleman from Indiana takes an
appeal. The gentleman irom Ohio [Mr. Cox]
moves to lay the appeal on the table. The gentle-
man fiom Pennsylvania [Mr. Hickman] states
that he j ises to a question of privilege. The gen-
tleman will state his question of privilege.
Mr. HICKMAN. My question of privilege
is this: 11 is perfectly evident that we have got to
sit up here all night with Kentucky and border
State Rcpicsentatives 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman's remarks
are out of order.
Air. HICKMAN. The Speaker will please
hear my question of older.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state it
briefly.
Mi. HICKMAN. I am proceeding to state it
with as much brevity as possible.
The SPEAKER. The Chair cannot receive o
point of older, as Lhere is one already pending.
Mr. HICKMAN. 1 am proceeding to slate my
privileged question. I merely wish to state this,
that as it is evident we have got to sit up here ail
night with Kentucky and border State Represent-
atives, the gas be lit, that is all.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania is not in order.- The question is on the
motion of the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Cox,]
