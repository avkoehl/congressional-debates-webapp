fire of the enemy's batteries until the morning of the 21st of December. At sunrise of that day I received orders from General Ward to advance my picket-line. The advance found that the enemy had evacuated their works during the night. We captured 36 prisoners (among whom were 2 officers), 5 large guns, and 1 brass piece, with ammunition. My men removed six torpedoes, two on the railroad track and four on the turnpike road leading into the city. I shortly after received orders to move my brigade toward the city and encamp it, which I did.

The casualties during the campaign are as follows. *

Since my command left Atlanta it has subsisted mainly from the country. Up to the time of the capture of Savannah ten days' rations only had been issued by the commissaries. On the march foraging parties were sent our daily from each regiment and found ample supplies, subsistence stores of all kinds, and forage. But four days' rations of forage were brought from Atlanta, and up to the date of this report all the forage that has been used has been taken from the country. I have estimated that the troops of my command have procured from the country 62,000 rations and 13,000 days' forage. It is proper to state that the supplies thus obtained were equal quantity to double rations.

My command captured from the country 21 serviceable horses and 65 mules; besides these a number of animals were taken, which were used on the march and abandoned; also 150 head of cattle and 50 sheep.
