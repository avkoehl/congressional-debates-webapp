[Inclosure.]

ADJT. GEN'S. OFFICE, BUREAU FOR COLORED TROOPS,

Washington, D. C., October 20, 1865.

GENERAL: To the 101,950 colored soldiers in the service of the United States at the date of my last report, the following additions have been made during the year, namely:

17 regiments of infantry, aggregate strength.......... 16,201

2 regiments of heavy artillery, aggregate strength.... 2,703

2 batteries light artillery, aggregate strength....... 251

1 regiment of cavalry, aggregate strength............. 1,255

Recruits, drafted men, and substitutes sent to old regiments..............................................29,099

--------

Total gain.............................................49,509

*An examination of the original returns for February 28, 1865 (from which the numbers in this column were compiled), shows that all officers and men reported as "present for duty," "on extra or daily duty," and "in arrest or confinement," are here included under the head of "aggregate present available for duty."

+But see a later official compilation for April 30, 1865 (Vol. IV, this series, p. 1283), which gives an aggregate of 1,052,038.
