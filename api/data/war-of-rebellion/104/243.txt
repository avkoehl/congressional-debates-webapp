The commanding general directs that no cavalry horses be furnished for citizens or others not connected with the army who desire to visit the front, unless you know that they have official business with these headquarters.

CAPTAIN: The major-general commanding directs that you detail an officer and proper detachment of men and material to proceed without delay to the fleet to obtain a boat and go up the Apalachee River to a point opposite the works of the enemy in our front and as near their main works as practicable. As soon as this point is reached the officer will observe all movements of the enemy's boats and operations about his works, note the effect of our fire, and such other points as he may be able, and at once signal his information to the shore. If information cannot be obtained during the night, the party will return. At least two days' rations will be taken.
