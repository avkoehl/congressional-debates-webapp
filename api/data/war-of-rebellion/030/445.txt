Webster by W. G. Webster. I referred to it in a dispatch from Chattanooga.

Morgan, the partisan, performed a brilliant feat yesterday, taking 1,800 prisoners-more than his own number. I recommend that he be appointed brigadier-general immediately. He is indispensable.

General.

HEADQUARTERS WHARTON'S BRIGADE,Nolensville, December 10, 1862-9 p.m.

Brigadier General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of a dispatch from officer commanding my forces at Franklin, that an Irisham, named George More, had reached that place from Nashville this evening. He came by the Granny White road, and was also on the Hillsborough road, and reports no forces on the former and having heard of none on the latter. He further reports that General Rosecrans is to-day, and was yesterday, moving over to this side of the Cumberland; also that all the troops had four days' rations cooked, he supposes, for a general advance on Murfreesborough. The Irishman professes to be in your confidence, and says he knows Major Hawkins, of your staff. I have thought it proper to communicate this information just as I received it.

Respectfully, general,your obedient servant,

JNumbers A. WHARTON,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.
