Richmond, July 1, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: In answer to your personal appeal I send to you Abram Houghtaling. If my desire to gratify you had not been very great he would have been very differently dealt with. He has recently twice tried to bribe the under officers of the Libby. I think he will admit the charge. Moreover, I am very sure he is nothing but a civilian of the money-making sort. In spite of all this I send him to you. Pardon me if I cannot comply with your request as to the correspondents. Why cannot you agree to my propositions as to civilians and save heartbreaks on both sides of the line?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Richmond, July 1, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I think the captain of the John Rice misapprehended Captain Thompson. The latter did not intend to be understood as threatening to detain the boat. If he did, any such act would have been entirely unauthorized and would be appropriately punished. I cannot pretend to offer any excuse for any such conduct. Everybody on board your boat is entirely under your control until delivered.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

FORT MONROE, July 2, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Forty-seven of our women and children, being all that were captured at Winchester, have just arrived here from Richmond via City Point and go to Annapolis to-night. The rebels say that they did not intend to retain them, but did not wish to send them through our lines at any other point. Abram Houghtaling, captured on the Mississippi, whose release you desired me to obtain, has been sent to me. The release of Richardson and Browne is again refused on the ground of retaliation. Three thousand five hundred men and 108 officers of Milroy's command have been taken to Richmond. One thousand of these were delivered at City Point and go to Annapolis to-night.

Files of Richmond papers from the 23rd of June to this date just received. Will be forwarded to you by the first mail. The rebels declare themselves fully prepared to meet our forces operating from the White House and to defend Richmond, and apprehend we will undertake to march by Gordonsville and Culpeper to the Potomac River, destroying their railroads and bridges after us. Extracts from Richmond papers of July 1 have just been sent to you.

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for the Exchange of Prisoners.
