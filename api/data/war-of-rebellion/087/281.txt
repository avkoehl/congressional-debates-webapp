Volunteers being on my left and the Sixty-sixth New York Volunteers on my right. After some distance the brigade was halted and formed line in a corn-field on the crest of a hill. Shortly afterward, the enemy opened a heavy artillery fire on my line, when I was ordered by Lieutenant-Colonel Broady, commanding brigade, to advance the left of the regiment in order to better cover it from view of the enemy. In this action I sustained a slight loss. The regiment remained in this position until dark, when, it in connection with the One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, was detailed for picket duty. After establishing the in nothing of interest occurred until morning of the 15th, when the enemy opened a brisk musketry fire upon the line of the regiment. Things remained in this position until 12 m., when I received orders directly from General Barlow, commanding First Division, Second Army Corps, to advance the line at intervals of about one hour and again fall back, in order to keep the enemy engaged and keep them from going to our right, as there was at that time some fighting going on on the extreme right of the line. By advancing in this way I drew the fire of the enemy, both of infantry and artillery, and consequently sustained the loss of some men killed and wounded. At 8 p.m. the regiment was relieved from picket and rejoined the remainder of the brigade some distance to the rear on the New Market road. Remained in this position until 1 p.m. on the 16th, when, I in connection, with the remainder of the brigade, moved about three miles to the right in support of a part of the Tenth Corps, which was then engaged with the enemy. Nothing of interest occurred but picket-firing until 7 p.m. when the regiment was detailed for fatigue duty, and immediately reported to Brigadier-General Foster, of Tenth Corps, when it was put to building earth-works some distance in rear of the line first occupied. By 12.30 p.m. the works were finished and the regiment again reported back to the remainder of the brigade, when it immediately took up the line of march to the right. After moving with some delay to the right about two miles, the regiment, with the remainder of the brigade, halted about 3 a.m. of the 17th on a road, where it remained until 4 p.m., when I marched some distance to the left and formed line in a dense woods at right angles with the road upon which the regiment had just been formed. I remained here until 5 p.m. of the 18th, when a heavy fire opened some distance on my right, when I received orders to be ready to march at short notice. I soon after marched by the right flank, some distance to the edge of a field, when I in connection with the remainder of the brigade, was ordered back to same position I occupied before. After returning, line was formed and the men were ordered to rest until 6 p.m., when the whole brigade moved by the left and marched some two miles and formed line of battle along the New Market road. After the line was formed I was ordered to form earth-works along my front, which kept the men hard at work all night. Remained in this place until 8 p.m. of the 20th, when, I in connection with the remainder of the brigade, took up the in of march, crossing the James and Appomattox Rivers, and arrived in front of Petersburg at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 21st, 1864. I herewith transmit a list of casualties.*

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SCHREYER,

Captain, Commanding Fifty-third Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers.

Lieutenant J. WENDEL MUFFLY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
