Honorable T. A. SCOTT,

Colonel Wright has done to Washington. Will see you on Wednesday in reference to Friedman's and other regiments. I wish to act in harmony and relieve from embarrassment when in my power. When will Negley's brigade be paid?

Colonel THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Washington, D. C.:

DEAR SIR: Fearing I was not as explicit in my communication yesterday as I should have been with regard to subduing the unholy rebellion now existing against us, I will now say, in my chemical experiments I have discovered that missiles may be conveyed among the rebels in a shell from a mortar, and by the concussion that follows liquid streams of five will spread most fearfully in all directions.

Would our Government be willing to use in the Army missiles of this character? Its effects may be tested in a small way in the course of a few minutes.*

I think that such means of destruction are hardly within the category of those recognized in civilized warfare. Kindred inventions have been made in Europe, but I do not think they have been employed in modern times. I could not recommend their employment until we exhaust the ordinary means of warfare.

Very respectfully,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
