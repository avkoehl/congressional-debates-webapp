Mr É went on to remark upon this article,
that it placed the establishment of but one branch
in the reach, or power of Congiess, and that one
was m the District of Columbia—m a district of
ten miles square—leaving the vast extent of
twenty four States, and three Territories, to ob-
tain branches for themselves upon contingencies
not dependent upon the will, or power, of Con-
gress, or requiring her necessities, or even her
convenience to be taken into the account A laio
of Congress could obtain a branch in this District,
but with respect to every State, the establishment
of the branch depended, first, upon the mere will
and pleasure of the bank, and, secondly, upon the
double contingency of a subscription, and a legis-
lative act, within the State If, then, the mother
bank does not think fit, for its own advantage, to
establish a branch, or, if the people of a State do
not acquire 52,000 shares of the stock of the bank,
and the Legislature, therefore, demand it, no
branch will be established in any State, or any
Temtory, of the Union Congress can only re-
quire a branch, in any State, after two contingen-
cies have happened in the State, neither of them
having the slightest reference to the necessities, 01
even convenience, of the Federal Government
Heie, then, (said Mr B ,) is the treasuiy estab-
lished for the United States ' A treasui y which 13
to have no existence but at the will of the bank,
or the will of a State Legislature, and a few of its
citizens, enough to own two thousand shaies ot a
stock worth one hundí ed dolhi s a share ' A treas
ury which Congiess has no «and in establ slung,
and cannot preserve aftci it is established, for the
mother bank, after establishing hei branches, may
shut them up, or withdiaw them Such a thing
has alleady happened Branches in the West have
been—someshutup,somewithdrawn,and 111 these
cases the treasury was broken up, according to this
newfangled conception of a national treasury No'
(said Mr B ,) the Federal bank 19 no more the
tieasury of the United States Man the State banks
are One is just as much the treasury as the other,
and made so by this very fourteenth fundamental
article of the constitution of the bank Look at it'
Look at the alternative' Wheie branches are not
established, the State banks are to be employed '
The Bank of the United States js to select the
State bank, the Secretary of the Treasury is to
approve the selection, and if he does so, the State
bank so selected, and so approved, becomes the
keeper of the public moneys, it becomes the de
pository of the publii moneys, it transfers them,
it pays them out, it does everything except make
discounts for the mother bank and issue uotesa it
does everything which the Federal Government
wants done, and that is nothing but what a bank
of deposite can do The Government makes no
choice between State banks and branch banks
They are all one to her They stand equal in her
eyes, they stand equal in the charter of the bank
nself, and the horror that has now broken ojt
against the State banks is a thing of recent con
ception—a veiy modern ímoulsioi, which is re
buked and condemned by the veiy authon y tj
which it traces 1 s sourc  Mr B said the State
banks were just as much made the Federal tieas
ury by the bank charter as the United States Bank
itself was, and that was sufficient to annihilate the
argument which now sets up the Federal bank
for the Federal treasury But the fact was that
neither was made the treasury, and it would be
absurd to entertain such an idea for an instant, for
the Federal bank may surrender her charter, and
cease to exist itcan do so at any moment it pleases,
the State banks may expire upon their limitation,
they may surrender, they may be dissolved m
many ways, and so cease to exist, and then there
would be no treasury1 What an idea, that tne
existence of the treasury of this great Republic is
to depend, not upon itself, but upon corporations,
which may cease to exist, on any day, by their
own will, or their own crimes Mr B hoped that
the Senator from Virginia, [Mr Leigh,] who had
just referred to the Federal bank as the Federal
tieasury, would find an argument in this four
teenth fundamental ar icle ot the constitution of
the bank sufficiently laige to claim his attention,
and to receive from him that answer which others
had deemed it too insignificant to merit
Mr LEIGH roseand pledged himself to answer
the aigument of the Senator fiom Missouri, as
soon as the course of the debate would allow him
to do so, without interfering with the rights of
others who weie no«v entitled to the floor
Mi GRUNDY said he was at a loss to perceive
any connection between the extra allowances in the
Post Oifice Department and the memorial from |
Culpepper county, Vnginia He was not in the
habit of making de bene esse speeches here, but he
was anxious to have these extra allowances fully
investigated We had the repoit of the Post
master General made on this subject—it was
oidered to be printed, and would be ready for oui
examination, he had been informed, in a few days
Was it not better, then, to wait until we should
have the means of ascertaining for what purpose
these extra allowances were made, what services
were rendered for them, and whether or not the
public hid been mateually benefited by them
\nd as soon as we saw for what purpose they
were made, and that they weie not for the public
good, he would be as ready to conaemn the act as
any man We might all, perhaps, join in saying
he had extended his accommodations too far, but
before we cenRuied, we should see that the head of
the department had heaped the money upon favor
ites Extra allowances had been paid to con
tractors on the Piedmont route, ahigfily impoitant
one, and if it should be found that the allowance
was not more than the services rendered were worth,
he thought no one ought to complain It was not
treating the department fanly to take up the Blue
Book, pick out a contract for §5,U00, and then
because 3, 4, orgo,000 moie were alio wed-tor extra
services, to say it wa3 worthy of censure We
should first see what were the original teimsof the
contiact, and if additional services weie rendered,
compare them with the additional price, and then
censure as might be necessary
Mr TYLER rose to propound an lnqun y to the
chairman of the Committee on Post Offices, &c
We had been now nearly four months in session
The public have had proceedings from the Post
master Geneial, fiom which it was manifest, that
the department was out of order The public
had, therefore, anticipated a repoit from the Post
Office Committee, and he desired to know what
pi ogress the Committee had made m the develop-
ment cf the true condition of the depaitment, and
what weie the impediments in the way of a devel
opmentof its truecondition He wished toknow,
if the inquiry wasproper, why thecomnittee were
not more prompt in their action
Mr LEIGH mquiied of the gentleman from
Tennessee [Mr Gromiy] if he had discovered,
and could explain, the cause of the starry coirus-
cations in the fiiriement over Virginia?
Mr   GRUNDY repl ed that he believe 1 Vir
gima always had moie sta-s than any other State '
in the Union, and therefore he was not a little sur-
pnsed that any Virginian should be startled at it   I
In answer 1.0 the other sentleman from Virginia on
his lefi, [Mr Tyler,] he said that he did not ques   '
tion the light of any gent'emai tomqu re how far
he had done his dutv    Cut the Senate might be
sure of oie thing, that the greatest vigilance would
be exercised, and a full, fair, and impartial expo-
sition of the whoje state of the department should
be made to the Senate    To say at what stage the
committee had now arrived was a very difficult
thing If the Senate had passed the resolution
offeied by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr Ev i\g]
__and he hoped it would be adopted  to da —the
committee might have progressed more lapidly
But he gave the gentleman his solemn assmance,
that they would proceed till everything was known
which it was desirable to know, and moie thanjie
could wish
Mr CLAYTON trusted we would learn some-
thing of the propriety of these extra allowances
But we never could ascertain their whole amount
He was waited on the other eve mg by an officer
of the Tieasury Department, wno infoimed him
that they could not give the original contiacts in
the Comptroller's Office, owing to their destruction
m the late Treabury building The depar m?nt
was known to be bankrupt— twas not resoonoibl-
to the pubnc—it owed no íesponsibility to Con-
giess Jt was so constituted that it laid in the will
of one man to dispose of the funds as he pleased
And this state of things would never be remedied
till the department was placed on the same footing
as the other departments The post office law
provided that extra allowances should be appor-
tioned according to the original contrict. But he
could prove that in fifty cases the Postmaster Gen
eral had violated that law It was a department
which had more power than all the other depart-
ments in *he Government put together It was
able to secure the election of any man they pleased,
or to put out any man who was in Tne Post-
master General could create as many clerks as he
pleased—he could make fifty to morrow, at a sal
ary of $1,000 each The contingent expenses were
voted for bylaw, but the incidental expenses were
incurred and paid at the pleasure of the department,
without knowing what the items weie Fiom
twenty to thirty thousand agents were subjected to
the will of one man, and if they had all been in
Tennessee before the late Senatorial election, he did
not know what effect they might have had on the
honorable member's election It was his conviction
that this department exercised more power than
all the others combined, it was also increasing,
appointing political partisans everywhere, and was
exercising more influence over the elective fran-
chise than any other
Mr GRUNDY said it was his principle to leave
as little to tne discretion of the Departmentas was
possible, only leaving it tlje means ot peiformmg
its appropriate duties to the country, and when
the gentleman from Delaware [Mr Ojaytov]
snould introduce a measure to bring its discretion
down to that point, it should have his hearty sup-
port We could get all the information we desired,
notwi hstandmg the recent burmngoftheTreasury
build ng The people ought nottobetold that the
original contracts were destroyed, and that, there-
fore, their contents could not be ascertained For
supposing all the ongirals were consumed, could
we not ascertain what they were, as easily as if
we Had the originals > When a contract was bid
off, a record was made of it, and therefore, although
we could not have the originals, we could have
abstracts from the record, giving the pnce, the
name of the contractor, and the extra allowances,
and therefore the public ought not to be induced
to oelpve tnat we cannot obtain full and accurate
mfoimation, the only erroi could be (which was
not orobable) in making the record Pie would
no go back to the mves Rations four yeais ago
But although the geitlemao tnen said the depart-
ment was banki ipt, yet the gentleman fiom Ken-
tucky [Mr BiBp] and others, at the very time,
denied it They siid it was rich and productive,
and advocated a reduction of the postage on news
papers upon that belief, which would have had the
effect of breaking down the mails and coaches
And ltv as prooaMe this state of prospenty would
have continued, had it not been for the post office
bill of that session, which passed the House of
Rep-esentatives, cieating from forty to fifty thou-
sand additional miles of post road, but when the
bill came h re, we reducd it to from twenty to
thirty thousand, yet it still incieased th° expenses
of the Department enormously The gentleman
thought it the most powerful department in the
Government, and ne (Mr G ) agreed with him
that it was so, and must necessarily be so, fiom
its very nature, because it had more mtercours
