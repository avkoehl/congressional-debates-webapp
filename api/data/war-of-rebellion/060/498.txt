Colonel MULLIGAN, New Creek:

Your telegram received. If the enemy is falling back pursue him at once. Keep yourself advised fully in regard to the force on the Greenland Gap road; also the road from Greenland Gap via the junction of the Moorefield-Alleghany pike. Sullivan's cavalry (four regiments) will arrive in Romney to-night.

Unless you are fully satisfied that a rebel force has gone toward Oakland, I think you had better stop One hundred and twenty-third at New Creek. I sent Captain Myers to Frankfort to reconnoiter. Will send One hundred and thirty-ninth Pennsylvania to North Branch bridge. All quiet below this point.
