HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Near Fort Buffalo, Va., August 24, 1864.

Lieutenant C. B. LYELL,

Thirteenth New York Cav., Comdg. Cav. at Lewinsville:

LIEUTENANT: The party under Mosby which attacked the camp at Annandale this morning has retired from the attack without accomplishing anything more than the wounding of one horse. Another attempt will doubtless be made somewhere along our line, either during the day or to-night. The point selected will probably be at your stockade. The colonel commanding directs me to tell you to caution your pickets and your men to be on the alert, and assure yourself that they are, especially toward daybreak to-morrow, should an attack not come sooner. Keep two horses saddled in the stockade all the day and to-night, and in the case of an attack let us know here at once by sending out in two different directions. This will make sure of one of your messengers reaching us. Colonel Lazelle directs you not to surrender your command under any consideration or emergency. Please send word by the bearer how many horses and men you have with you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWIN Y. LANSING,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
