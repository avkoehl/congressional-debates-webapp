HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 18, 1864-6. 15 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

I am instructed to inform you that General Hancock will withdraw after 9 o'clock this evening, and General Burnside will follow him, and take post on Wright's left. Early to-morrow morning Wright and Burnside will advance close up to the enemy's position. Your left is well enough covered to-night by the position of the Sixth Corps.

A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

FIFTH CORPS,

May 18, 1864-8 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I felt no apprehension about the safety of my left, but I thought I should inform you of its condition, so that General Wright might know it too. I will send you a sketch of our position this evening. We used twenty-six guns to-day, and fired about 1,800 rounds. The enemy replied with almost as many. He fired from 20-pounders, 10-pounders, 12-pounder, and 3-inch guns. Our casualties are about 4 killed and 16 wounded. My men were all sheltered by parapets and have now their ears well accustomed to heavy-artillery firing.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 18, 1864-8.15 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Burnside will move by daylight to-morrow, and leave you on the right flank. There will be nothing to your right or rear. You should, therefore, remove all your trains, artillery, &amp;c., this side of the Fredericksburg road, and you had better send a brigade to the Harris house or vicinity to keep a watch.

MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 18, 1864-9.15 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your dispatch relating to movements to-morrow morning is received. I will send Colonel Kitching to the point you have indicated. My right flank line is already intrenched.

G. K. WARREN.

Major-General.
