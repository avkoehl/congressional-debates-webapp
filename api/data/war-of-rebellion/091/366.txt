Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

GENERAL: There are at Camp Stoneman 1,087 cavalrymen waiting equipment and horses. The guerrillas are becoming troublesome in the country toward Poolesville. I have applied to Headquarters of the Army for horses to mount 350 of these people, with the intention of establishing them near Muddy Branch to patrol the river. I authorized General Slugh to arm with rifles the surplus men of Battery H, Independent Pennsylvania Artillery, and use them as train guards. Your communication received. Howe has returned.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Rectortown:

GENERAL: General Halleck approves. I have ordered three companies from the aqueduct to report to General Slough, leaving one on duty there. Can I not send the Fifth Wisconsin to Alexandria? It can remain there as well as here, save time in the future. If necessary, it can be temporarily quartered at the Soldiers' Rest, Alexandria.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
