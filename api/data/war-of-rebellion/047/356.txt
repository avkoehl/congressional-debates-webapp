I presume, as I directed the boat to be stopped, the report required is expected from me.

When the boat was discovered coming in, a blank cartridge was fired, which caused the boat to stop for a moment; it afterward started again, when a shorted gun was fired across the bow; it again came to, but a short time after it was seen moving in the direction of Sullivan's Island, it having changed its course. A shots was now fired nearer the bow of the boat, which caused it to stop, and soon after a boat was seen coming from the direction of Charleston, bearing a flag of truce and the Confederate ensign. The glad of truce from the enemy was first signaled to stop when off Battery Wagner; it crossed from that point in the direction of a point opposite on Sullivan's Island, and had gone a little more (I think) than half way, when it was finally stopped.

As soon as the boat was seem coming in, I reported the fact to Brigadier-General Clingman, commanding Sullivan's Island. Before his instructions could be carried out, the boat referred to as having come from the direction of the city had approached the enemy's boat.

Flags of truce from the enemy have since come in and communicated with boats from Fort Sumter.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM BUTLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

All quiet yesterday and to-day. Iron-clads repairing damages of 8th instant. Enemy putting heavy Parrott guns in position on Morris Island, against Moultrie and Sullivan's Island batteries, as already reported probable. Our batteries annoy them much as practicable, regard being had to proper economy of ammunition.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
