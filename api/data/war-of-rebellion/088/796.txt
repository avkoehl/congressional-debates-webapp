superintendent of construction, having failed to communicate with the chief engineer at these headquarters, has been improperly located, and is exposed for some distance to the view of the enemy, who has established batteries from which he fires at all passing trains. No damage has yet been done, but much annoyance to passers-by and the camps in the vicinity.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT, September 12, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Thirty-fourth North Carolina Regiment, Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division, has just been forwarded from the headquarters of the Ninth Army Corps. He came into our lines about dark last evening. His brigade (Scales') lies directly in front of the lead-works, and about 300 yards west of the Weldon railroad. Wilcox's division is on extreme right of the line, and the Weldon railroad runs through it, a little to the left of its center. Informant states that they are extending the line of works still farther to the right in a westerly direction. He thinks it is about half a mile from the railroad to the extreme right of the infantry line. They throw out a very heavy skirmish line every day in front of Wilcox's division. Cut rations down last week one-fourth; issue regularly every other day. Informant has been in the regiment but a short time and had little information; knows nothing of the return of any of the force in the Valley.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. BABCOCK.

WALTHALL STATION, September 12, 1864-9.30 a. m.
