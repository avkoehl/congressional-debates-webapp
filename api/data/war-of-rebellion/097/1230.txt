HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 28, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The storm in this section has been most severe. With every exertion to get forward we have made but eight miles in two days and are now completely mud-bound, the roads being utterly impassable. I shall be compelled to remain here till they improve, and have set forward to Fredericksburg to have subsistence and forage collect to meet me at that point. There will be no unnecessary delay in pushing forward, but it is quite impossible to say when we shall reach Washington. I will telegraph again on reaching Fredericksburg. I think I have never experienced worse roads.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
