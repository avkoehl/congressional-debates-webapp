On the --- of August we challenged his right to hold them by a bold advance, and day after day and night after night, until the 11th, did we hold him in a deadly embrace. At 9 p. m. of the 11th we moved about three-fourths of a mile to the right and relieved a portion of General Morgan's division. This position we held until the night of the 26th. On the 19th, before daylight, moved out of our works on the Sandtown road about one-half mile and took up a position in readiness to support the troops on our right, if necessary; remained until night and returned to our works. On the 20th made a little movement as far as Wallace's place for a similar purpose; reported to Brevet Major-General Davis; relieved General Morgan's division, which went forward on a reconnaissance to the right as far as the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad. At 5 p. m. we were relieved by General Davis, and returned to our works and reported to our division commander. From the 20th to the night of the 26th we remained in our works, being constantly annoyed but not seriously hurt by the enemy's artillery and sharpshooters; occasionally a man was hit. During our stay upon the Utoy Hills we captured about 90 prisoners and received within our lines about the same number of deserters. At 1 a. m. on the morning of the 27th we quit our old works under a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery, and moved about one mile upon the Sandtown road. Here we halted and formed a line of battle, front to the rear, to cover the movement of our trains, General Morgan's division forming on our right. As the trains advanced we fell back, forming line of battle upon three successive positions to cover and protect our trains. The enemy made but a feeble advance, feeling our skirmish line very cautiously. Our line was handled very skillfully, but with boldness, by Captain Grosvenor, brigade inspector. The trains being safely guarded to a place of safety within our new lines, we moved as far as Wallace's house. At 5 p. m. we were ordered forward to report to General Davis; by his order advanced as far as the Widow Holbrook's place and camped for the night in a position to protect the trains then parked near Patterson's. On the 28th marched by a cross-road to Mount Gilead Church; remained with the teams until 10 a. m.; were then ordered by General Thomas to report to our division commander; marched with the division until near night, when we crossed the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad; took up a position about three-fourths of a mile from Red Oak Station. Remained in position on the 29th. On the 30th marched at 6 a. m. by Shoal Creek Church; met the enemy's cavalry in small force and skirmished with it about one mile, to

house, killing 1 and capturing 2 of the enemy; took up a strong position; sent forward the Ninety-second Ohio for picket duty; received reports of the enemy moving in the direction of Jonesborough during the night, and sent the reports to General Baird. About daylight on the morning of the 31st I went out to the picket-line, then half a mile in advance of

house. As soon as it became light I saw the enemy's trains moving in the direction of Rough and Ready on the Jonesborough road; reported the same to General Baird, who ordered Captain Morgan, Seventh Indiana Battery, to report to me with his battery, which I advanced to the skirmish line, supporting it with my entire brigade; placed the battery in a commanding position; it opened fire upon the enemy's trains, causing much disorder amongst the wagons and driving them from the main road. About 7 a. m. I was visited by Major-General Sherman and Brigadier-General Baird, who ordered me to send one or two
