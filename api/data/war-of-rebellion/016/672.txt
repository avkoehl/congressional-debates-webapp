ant adjutant-general to General Pender, was taken prisoner that night returning from my headquarters to his own brigade. The batteries of Braxton, Pegram, McIntosh, and Crenshaw were gallantly served during this fight and did yeoman service.

The battle being thus gloriously won, my men slept among the dead and dying enemy. My loss was 199 killed, 1,308 wounded; total, 1,507, of which Gregg's brigade lost 619.

The brave Colonels [J. F.] Marshall, of South Carolina, and [W. A.] Forbes, of Tennessee, were killed. Lieutenant-Colonel [D. A.] Ledbetter, of South Carolina, also met a soldier's death. Colonels [D.] Barnes, Edwards, and McGowan, Lieutenant-Colonels McCorkle, [T. S.] Farrow, and McCrady, and Major [B. T.] Brockman, of Gregg's brigade, were wounded. The stubborn tenacity with which Gregg's brigade held its position this day is worthy of highest commendation.

OX HILL.

Monday evening, September 1, the division arrived near German town, on the Little River turnpike, and it was understood the enemy were in force in a strong position known as Ox Hill, and prepared to dispute our farther passage. By direction of General Jackson I sent the brigades of Branch and Brockenbrough to feel and engage the enemy. This battle commenced under the most unfavorable circumstances-a heavy, blinding rain-storm directly in the faces of my men. These two brigades gallantly engaged the enemy, Branch being exposed to a very heavy fire in front and on his flank. Gregg, Pender, Thomas, and Archer were successively thrown in. The enemy obstinately contested the ground, and it was not until the Federal Generals Kearny and Stevens had fallen in front of Thomas' brigade that they were driven from the ground. They did not, however, retire far until later during the night, when they entirely disappeared. The brunt of this fight was borne by Branch, Gregg, and Pender.

Colonel [R. H.] Riddick and Lieutenant-Colonel [Major Eli M.] Miller, of Pender's brigade, were mortally wounded, and Captain [L. W.] Stowe, commanding Sixteenth North Carolina, and Major [Jona.] Rivers, of Thomas' brigade, severely so. My loss was 39 killed and 267 wounded; total, 306.*
