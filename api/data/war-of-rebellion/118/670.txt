There may be cases of a subsequent date when from peculiar circumstances it would be advisable to recognize irregular paroles, but in all such cases a special report with full rolls of the parties should be forwarded to this office as early as practicable.

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Commanding Defense of Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith communications+ from Colonel W. G. Veazey, Sixteenth Vermont Volunteers, commanding at Union Mills; Lieutenant Colonel H. H. Wells, provost-marshal-general, Alexandria; Captain W. D. Munson, provost-marshal, Union Mills, and Captain E. M. Camp, commanding Soldiers' Rest, all covering paroles given by individual officers or soldiers in violation of General Orders, No. 49, current series, and are therefore void, and I am directed by the General-in-Chief to order these men to report to you to be proceeded against as you may direct. By the cartel all prisoners of war are to be delivered and paroled at certain named places and when this provision of the cartel is violate the paroles so given are invalid; but this does not relieve those who give such paroles from the penalties for violating General Orders, No. 49.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
