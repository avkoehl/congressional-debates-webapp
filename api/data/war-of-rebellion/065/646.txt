If those portions of railroad near the coast are removed, the enemy will be much less likely to attempt invasion, as one of their chief objects must be to possess themselves of an easy railroad communication between the Gulf and the Atlantic.

The removal and construction of these railroad lines might be effected through the engineer department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY BRYAN,

Major and Assistant Inspector General.

Major General J. P. ANDERSON,

Lake City, Fla.:

If enemy has retired within his trenches at Jacksonville, or on board his transports, Clinch's cavalry will be sent at once to guard communications from attack by way of Satilla and Saint Mary's.

Major WILLIAM H. ECHOLS,

Chief Engineer:

H. C. Keltner has never reported. I think he must be with brigade in Florida. G. W. Keltner cannot be spared. Our South Carolina regiments have been so cut up by details that I think we should hold on to these Georgians, when they want to stay with us.

JNO. JOHNSON,

Captain, Engineer.
