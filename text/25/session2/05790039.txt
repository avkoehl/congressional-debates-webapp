Senate.
what would be the consequences of his false posi-
tion, all oí which have already been realized The
Senator from Kentucky hab already taken the pre-
cise ground which he foretold wouid be taken Nor
is the Senator less mistaken in supposing that he
has been opposed to the discussion of the subject.
He has, it is true, been utteily and unalterably
opposed to any discussion with the Abolitionists.
They have no right to come here, and he was, and
is for shutting the door in their face , but he never
shunned discussion when the subject came fairly
up, nor would hs, so long as the Senator's consti-
tuent' and others continue to agitate the subject,
in proof of which, he referred the SenD'or to the
course he adopted m relation to the President's
Message, some years since, on the circulation oí
incendiary publications through the mail So far
from avoiding discussion, he raised a special com-
mittee on that portion of the Message, made a full
report adverse to the President's views, accom-
panied by a bill, which gave rise to much discus-
sion So now, acting on the sama principle, he
had presented these resolutions as the antagonist of
the Vermont ¡evolutions He touched on these
misapprehensions oí the Senator as to his course,
the more fully, as theie appeared to be a fixed de-
termination of late, both in and out of this Cham-
ber, to mistake his coui=e on this as well as other
occasion 
But this is not the only instance of the misstate-
ment of his course by the Senator. He has mis-
apprehended it as much in relation to the subject
immediately undei discussion Assuming, errone-
ously, as he had shown, that his position had been
that Congress has no right to agitate or discuss this
subject, howevei presented, he accuses him (Mr
C ) of challenging debate on the present occasion,
and says that he (Mr D ) would have remained si-
lent had it not been for his challenge The Sena-
tor greatly mistakes in supposing he had made any
such challenge, and he thought it vv ould puzzle him
to state when and in what tei ms it was given. It
is true, he stated, that the poln.cal creed of the Se-
nator, and those who thought with him, in lele-
rence to the origin and structure of our Govern-
ment, so far from affording any constitutional pro-
tection against the assaults ol ihe Abolitionists., had
roused their fanatical spirit into action, and he had,
at the same time, called on the party generally who
enteitamed it, to show, if he was in a mista! e as
to the effet t of their creed, what piolechon it af-
forded If the Senator has construct this into a
challenge to discuss these resolutions, he must say
he has mo«t s gnally failed to meet it He has
wholly shunned the point on which it was given
He has not even attempted to show that the view
which he and his paity take of the Constitution
can afford the least protection against the dangers
w hich now so seriously menace the country and us
institution^ His silence he had a right t( consider
as conclusive proof ot the tiuth of his assertion,
and the Senator ought not to be surpiis-d i(, after
this tacit confession, hs should turn to those who
entertained the opposite constitut onal views, and
call on them exclusively to rally to the íescue at
this horn of danger The Senator was so conscious
of his weakness on this point, that instead of at-
tempting to point out a remedy, when his political
theory afforded none, he to.>k the opposite course,
to deny that there was any dinger to be íepe'led
He told us, gravely, that the Abolitionists vpre no
Di unionist., that thev had no ami itious objects,
no con upt purpose, that they repudiated all inter-
ference with the States, that they only aimed to
abolish slavery in the Territories and m this Dis-
trict, where there were not more than 2,000 slaves,
and that they claimed no light, but to beg jou to
giant them the innocent and harmless boon they
craved, (of cutting our throats and burning out
houses,) and that these beegars weie but a hand-
ful, of whom a large portion were females. Sach
is the picture wh ch hs gives of this small band of
innocents, and the harmless motives that actua*e
them, and this, m the face of the constant, urn-
form, and open avowal, that their object is the to-
tal abolition of slavei y m the States, as well as m
this District and the Territories, and that they con-
sider the abolition in the latter but as the first ste¡>
to abolition in the former.
But he had received a letter that very morning
from one of the fraternity, of high standing and
authority, which gave a very different account of
this small corps of humble beggars He says that
they count 1,500 societies, averaging 100 indivi-
duals each, and are growing at the rate of one
society a day. Here, then, we have 150,000 per-
sons regularly organized, with a copious revenue,
and an extensive and powerful press, (,\ large por-
tion of whom are the Senator's constituents) who
are waging regular war on the institutions of the
southern and western States, institutions that in-
volve not less than $900,000,000 of property, and
the prosperity and safety of an entire section of this
Union, in violation of the most solemn! \ plighted
faith, and subveision of the fundamental principles
of the Constitution, and yet the Senator can see
neither harm nor danger in all this When we see
one of his enlightened understanding, and usually
correct sentiments, thus thinking and feeling, what
must be the tone of those with whom he is daily
associated, which could so blind h s understanding
and blunt his moral perception?
He next tells us that the Abo'itiomsts can do no
harm, that their publications cannot cir< ulate in the
slaveholding States, and can do no mischief in the
non-slaveholdmg States, that the evil exists here,
where loo much excitement exists, dud mat il «e
would keep perfectly cool and patient, and hear
ourselves and constituents called robbers and mur-
derers, and our rights and property and lives at-
tacked, without moving hand or tongue, all would
be well Accustomed, as he hat been, to respect
the Senator tor his sober and correct judgment and
feelings on most subjects, he could not but be sur-
prised at the language which he has held on the
present occasion Is his judgment so perverted that
he can see no dangei to the Constitution and the
Union, for which he professes, and, he doubted not,
sincerely, to have so much regard, in the thousands
of publications and lectures which are daily issued
and delivered, holding up, in the blackest colore,
the character and institutions of near 1> one-lnlf of
the Union, exciting towards them the deepest feel-
ings of abhorrence, to be returned, on then part,
with a detestation not less deep? Is the universal
spread of this deep, mutual abhorrence, comp Uible
with the existence of the Union"* II not, is it not
time to arrest it, and, of course, to deliberate on the
means of dom* it? Are the Senator's reasin and
feelings so far waiped, that he either cannot appre-
hend the plainest consequences, oi, apprehending,
is mdiffeient to them''
But we are next told, lor the hundreth time, that
these are mere abstract propositions, and not demand-
ed by the occasion, on which account, with various
other reasons that he assgns, he cannot vote for
them.
It was, he would suppose, perfect1 v needless for
the Senatoi to assign any reason fi i voting igpinst
these resolutions, or an} othci measure having the
same object in view, after wnat he had lol i tis of
the Abohtionisis, and the purity and h">m lessness
of their objects, nor is it at all suipi sin„ that he
should think that there was no nece* ity f r their
introduction But those who regard the subject in
a different light, who see danger whete the Senator
sees nothing to apprehend, and crime where he
beholds innocence, will cometoaveiy c'irteient
conclusion They will think it high lim  mat this
body should define its position, should declare its
opinion as to those unprovoked assaults or one por-
tion ol the Union on the othei, and take the stand
li intends to maintain m resistance o th°m, and
that the opposite course—to remain silent, or tam-
pei with the disease, is neither becoming its dignity
nor its duty.
As to what the Senitor has thought pro, ei to say
about tie secret mischief luikwg undei tu se reso-
lutions, about nullification and his (\,r C ) b t er
experience in relation to it, he undcistands his ob
jeU to be to distract and diaw off rtienti >'i from
trie reí! pi nt at issue, and he does, not d em it de-
serving leply He will pass it m silence, witn a
single remark. The experience of nullification is
indeed bitter, not to those who applied the remedy,
and freed themselves from a disease that was prey-
ing on the vitals of the Constitution and the South,
but to (hose against whom it was applied, and who
were fattening on the industry of the rest of the
community. He would tell the Senator that me
bitttr terms with which he and others of his creed
have denounced it, will only serve to endear it to
those of an opposite political faith, and, instead of
putting it down, give to it new vigor and growth.
The Senator asks, why mingle abolition with po-
litical matters? Why with the Texas question*
He knew not how to reconcile such questions with
the respect which he has entertained for the Sena-
toi 's intelligence and fairness. Does not the Sena-
tot know that we have received hundreds of peti-
tions, and that they continue daily to pour m on us
in one incessant stream, praying that Texas may
not be admitted, on the ground that it would extend
the limits of the slaveholding portion of the Union?
Does he not know that a sovereign State of the
Union has come here with its resolutions objecting
to the annexation on the same ground' Does he
not know that the entire movement on abolition,
with the object proposed to be effected, and the
means by whicn it is to be done, involves political
and constitutional questions and considerations of
the highest pissible magnitude, vital to the peace
and safety ol all' Knowing all this, wi h what
propriety could he ask me the ques ions he did'
Does he w ish to shift -the burden, bj making those
who repel, and not those who assail, respons ble '
Does he wish to tiansfer the odium from those uho
make war on our rights and property, to us who
di fend them, and this, too, in the face of the most
notorious facts ?
As brief as has Ivei his notice a/ the i>ena,orJs
apologj foi the Abolitionists, (for such he must
consider his speeeh,) it is much longer than he
would have made it, had it not been for theiespect
v Inch he has had for his talents and character He
cannot consider the course he has pursued in his
speech as indicative of his actual feelings and fair-
ness, and is compelled to regard it as indicative of
the distempered slate of the public sentiment of
those he represented Thus viewed, u affords an
mipoitant lesson to those he represented Through-
out, not a censure of the Abolitionists is whispered
All is excuse, defence, apology. It is we, not
they, who are the agitators , it is we, not they, who
are the disturbers of the peace and qniet of the
country , it is we, not they, who are the assailants,
it is we, not they, who harbor ambitious and im-
propei desisns, and, fina'ly, it is we, not they,
w ho meditate disunion It ..s .10 crime to attack
us, bui a heinous offence in us to defend ourselves
Mr NILES sa d he had taken no part m this
debate, and from the first, had no desire to do so,
and from the coarse it had taken, that purpose was
bj i o means weakened, so far as respected any
oencral discuss on of the various questions which
hid been brought m*o consideration It might,
hovve\er. be proper foi him to say a few words in
exp'mation of his own course He felt that the
resolutions before the Senate had placed himself
and some others in a delicate situation, be was,
and ever had been, decidedly opposed to the agita-
tion of this subject in Congress, m any form; he
was opposed to its discussion here, believing that it
would tend to increase the evil winch it was de-
signed to remove But it has been brought before
us" an 1 we are compelled to act upon it, and how-
ever he might regret that the question had been
biought up, unnecessarily as it appeared to him,
he should vote on the several propositions accord-
ing to his sense of duty to his constituents and the
counlrv
The mamer of treating this delicate question
-was, in his opinion, of some importance, as well as
me proceed ngs or measures which may be adopted
In this íespect he thought the course puisued had
not been judicious, and, he feared, Was not calcu-
lated to have a beneficial influence on public senti-
ment What is the object of these resolutions, and
what end is to be answered bj them' This qaes-
tion he resided asquteas important as that o,
tie correctness and propriety of the resolutions
themse'ves The object, he considered, was to
attempt to quiet the public mind, and stop the
spread of the spirit of Abolitionism He was aware
it was said by some gentlemen, that these lesolu-
nons were mere abstractions, not connected with
an> subject befoie the Senate, that they could luv e
