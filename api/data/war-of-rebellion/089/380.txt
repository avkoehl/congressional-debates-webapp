HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-10.45 a.m.

General HANCOCK:

Warren will cross a division at once at Armstrong's Mill and the rest of his corps will follow. The enemy's line strong; extends apparently to Armstrong's mill pond. Look out for your right and see that there is no enemy between you and Hatcher's Run.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,October 27, 1864-10.45 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: My second division is past Dabney's Mill; the Third Division is following. There has been a good deal of skirmishing with dismounted cavalry this morning, which has delayed me. Gregg is now firing in the direction I am marching, which is said to be the best road to Hatcher's.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,October 27, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I am at the Burgess house, on Boydton plank. General Gregg has just come up. Part of the enemy's cavalry retired by Burgess' across Hatcher's Run. General Gregg captured a few wagons. I am about moving out on White Oak road. It is six miles from this point to railroad and about two to bridge.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-4.15 p.m. (Received 5.20.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The signal officers report the movement of the enemy's troops down the Boydton plank road. No doubt they are concentrating toward you. The commanding general directs me to say that your orders remain unchanged; that is, to withdraw to-morrow morning and move back. You must withdraw Crawford also at the same time and send him to General Warren. The road between here and your headquarters is still infested by small parties of the enemy's cavalry or guerrillas. Please have it heavily patrolled now and during the night.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
