Lieutenant Colonel R. F. MAURY,

First Oregon Cavalry, Under Orders for Fort Walla Walla, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: On arriving at Fort Dalles you will take prompt measures to prosecute your march to Fort Walla Walla with the three companies of cavalry under your command. Transportation, the allowance of two wagons to a company, willbe furnished you by the commanding officer at Fort Dalles, as also ten days' subsistence for the march. Report has been made to these headquarters that a band of thieves are driving a number of Government mules stolen from Fort Walla Walla. It is desired to apprehend them and recover the property, and it has been suggested that by detaching a small portion of your command near John Day's Riverand sending them around by the headwaters of Butter Creek, there is agood prospect of recovery. Mr. Hamason, of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, is fully informed upon the matter and the locality, and I have to request that you will consult him on arriving at The Dalles and use your own judgment as to the necessity of dispatching such a party and its direction. If any apprehension be made take the property and thieves to Fort Walla Walla.

Trusting to hear of the early and safe arrival of your command at Fort Walla Walla, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,
