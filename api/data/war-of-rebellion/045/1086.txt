cution of orders without delay. I would like to see you or Captain Turnbull before you start, in relation to some communications for General Sedgwick. You can put the troops in motion without waiting for this.

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

JULY 2, 1863-6. 15 a. m.

Major General D. BUTTERFIELD:

General Newton has arrived here, and reports that General Sedgwick was on the way with him to Taneytown when he received the order directing his corps to come up via Littlestown. He at once turned back to put his corps in that direction. This accounts for his not reporting to you, as was expected. There is nothing new as yet this morning. The Second Corps is up and the Fifth is momentarily expected. Appearances indicate that the enemy is massing troops on our right and moving as if to turn our right flank. There has been a very little artillery firing this morning, but all is quiet now. The general does not at present think it necessary to send the headquarters train to Frederick.

Very respectfully, &c.,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Very respectfully, &c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
