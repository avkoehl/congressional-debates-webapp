Do you want Gist alone from here? Railroad too slow to send so far the few troops left here before knowing positively where enemy will strike.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Brigadier-General, Wilmington, N. C.:

Gist leaves this evening. Troops sent to you average about ninety hours per thousand men to go and return. We are too weak to run such risk, when enemy might be only making a feint at Wilmington to attack here, as has often been long meditial by him.

When necessary use my cipher with Smith and myself.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

I. Brigadier-General Gist will repair to Wilmington, N. C., for temporary service with Brigadier-General Whiting. He will take with him such of his staff as he may need.
