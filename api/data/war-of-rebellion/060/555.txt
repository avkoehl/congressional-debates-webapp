HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Martinsburg, February 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Commanding First Division, Harper's Ferry:

I am sending 500 cavalry and two pieces of artillery on the trot to Kearneysville, with instructions to strike the direct trail of the enemy and continue on it with all dispatch possible. The enemy cannot have more than 20 miles start of them, and if it is only such a force as we deem it and encumbered with booty, prisoners, &amp;c., I have no doubt but that they will overhaul them. I have placed the remainder of my mounted force in the saddle and dismounted men in line. Please instruct what further you desire me to do. My dismounted men are ready for any emergency.

J. M. SCHOONMAKER,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

HARPER'S FERRY, February 12, 1864.

Colonel SCHOONMAKER:

Pursue vigorously.

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

YORKTOWN, February 12, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

I wished Colonel Garrard's cavalry to make reconnaissance to King and Queen, but of course gave him some discretion, and he came back the same day he started, after going to Gloucester Court-House, only where I might have gone myself with one orderly. Of course I have learned nothing from them, and must send other cavalry. Colonel Garrard wishes to return to Fort Monroe. I can readily spare him, if you so wish.

I. J. WISTAR,

Brigadier-General.
