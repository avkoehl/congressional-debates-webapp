Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have just learned from General Hooker, in the advance, who states that the information is perfectly reliable that the enemy is making for Shepherdstown in a perfect panic; and General Lee last night stated publicly that he must admit they had been shockingly whipped. I am hurling everything forward to endeavor to press their retreat to the utmost.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army:

I am happy to inform you that Franklin's success on the left was as complete as that on the center and right, and resulted in his getting possession of the Burkittsville Gap, after a severe engagement. On all parts of the line the troops, old and new, behaved with the utmost steadiness and gallantry, carrying, with but little assistance from our own artillery, very strong position, defended by artillery and infantry. I do not think our loss very severe. The corps of D. H. Hill and Longstreet were engaged with our right. We have taken a considerable number of prisoners. The enemy disappeared during the night. Our troops are now advancing in pursuit of them. I do not know where he will be found. The morale of our men is now restored.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General BANKS:

I think that, under present circumstances, it will be well for you to move the greater part of your command to the south side of the Potomac. I do not consider that any danger to Washington is now to be feared from the north side of the river.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army:

There are already about 700 rebel prisoners at Frederick, under very insufficient guard, and I shall probably send in a larger number to-day.
