HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI, Warrensburg, Mo., February 22, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Missouri:

MAJOR: The citizens of Kansas City and other towns on the border are under apprehension of danger to the peace of that district of country from the Fifteenth Kansas (Jennison's regiment), if it should be stationed near the line. They state that many of the old Red Leg organization are in this regiment. I do not know whether this is so, but I respectfully suggest to the consideration of the commanding general that in order to allay as far as possible any cause for apprehension, that some other troops stationed in that district of country would have a good effect. I presume that General Curtis will recognize the importance of this arrangement.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
