HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,In Tennessee Valley, Poe's Tavern, September 5, 1863.

Colonel MINTY,

Commanding Cavalry:

I have just received from the department headquarters directions for you to communicate with General Burnside, which I believe you have already done. Keep thoroughly acquainted with what takes place above you, and as circumstances permit, contract your left, moving down the river. Make all your reports as before being placed under my command, besides those you make to me.

Very respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel MINTY,

Commanding Cavalry:

The Fifth Confederate Infantry relieved the Forty-fifth Tennessee at Blythe's. It is reported that the garrisons are moving down the river, relieving each other. Also that all the troops on the Upper Tennessee are concentrated at Charleston, having burned the Loudon Bridge. Do you hear anything to confirm these reports?

Respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel MINTY,

Commanding Cavalry:

I have sent to Pikeville all the teams (citizens and Government) I can raise here that can be spared to move the stores left there down the Sequatchie Valley. It is probable that you will yourself move down soon. Be pleased to retain what stores you need, and furnish to Captain Johnson wagons sufficient to remove the remainder after filling the wagons I send. If sufficient number of citizens' wagons can be got in your vicinity, they can be used.

Very respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
