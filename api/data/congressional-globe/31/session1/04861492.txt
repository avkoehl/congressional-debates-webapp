THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Aug. 1,
QrderÂ§d accordingly.
On-motion by Mr.' BUEL, the (jommittee on
jforeign Affairs was discharged from the further
consideration of sundry petitions upon the subject
of French spoliations; and they were referred to
the Committee of the Whole* on the state of the
Union having charge of the bill on that subject. (
Mr. FITCH rose and'asked the unanimous
consent of the House to submit a. motion that the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
be discharged from the further consideration of the
House bill, No. 250., heretofore reported from the
Committee on the Territories, and which had been
refe'rred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, viz: UA bill to create the office
of Surveyor General of the public lands in Oie-
gon, and to provide for the survey, and to make
donations to settlers on the said public lands."
* ! Mr. THURSTOIN" desired to be'informed by-
the Speaker what would be the effect of the motion
of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Fitch] if it
should prevail r
The SPEAKER. If the motion of the gentle-
man from Indiana should be agreed to, the effect
will be to bring the bill before the Hoifse for its
action. - ^
4 Mr. THURSTON. After the bill shall have
come before the House", will it be in order to offer
any amendment to if, which has not been offered
in the Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union ?
The SPEAKER. If the bill should be brought
before the House'upon this moticin, all motions
made or action ha'd in Committee of the-Wholeon
the state of the Union, will be passed by. The
House could not have any knowledge of the pro-
ceedings of the committee, and the -bill will be
open to amendment
' Mr. THURSTON". Then I hope that the motion
of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Fitch] will
be agreed to.
Mr. BISSELL rose to inquire what1 the hill
was?
The title of it had not been stated, but some
member replied to Mr. Bissell, that it was the
Oregon Land Bill. \
Mr. ASHMUN inquired of the Speaker,
whether un inimous consent would not be required
to enable the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Fitch]
to make his motion?
The SPEAKER said, the Chair had so stated.
Objection was made.
So the motion of Mr. Fitch was not enter-
tained.
Mr. WALDO, from the Committee on Revolu-
tionary Pensions, reported back, without amend-
ment, and with a recommendation that it be re- j
jected, the bill from the Senate entitled " An act
for the relief of Margaret L. Worth, widow of the
late General Worth, of the army of the Untied
States."
Mr. WALDO said that this bill directed the
Secretary of the Interior to place the name of
Margaret L. Worth, widow of the late Brevet Ma-
jor Genial Worth, on the pension roll, at the rate
of fifty dollars per month from the 7th day of
May, 1849, during her natural life. Th/3 bill has
been before the House and discussed at some
length some time since, and referred to the Com-
mittee on R^voluuonat y Pensions, who immedi-
ately considered it, but have been unable to report
it until now. He lemarked that the provisions of
this bill made two important, changes m our j
present pension system. In the first place, it gives
a pension to a widow for life, and not during
widowhood; and in the second place, the amount
of the pension is not limited to the half pay of a
lieutenant colonel, but is increased to the sum of
six hundred dollars per annum, a larger annuity
than was given to the widow of any soldier since
the war of the Revolution.
He further said, that there was now no law al-
lowing any gratuity to a class of persons of which
Mrs. Worth is one; and the friends of this bill
urge its passage on account of the high character,
and long and meritorious services of the late la-
mented General Worth. The committee, he said,
were unanimous in bearing testimony to the
gallantry, fidelity, and patriotism of that officer;
and they deeply regretted that-they could do no
mnre to perpetuate the many virtues so conspicu-
ous in his character and life. But the committee
could n< t distinguish between the services of Gen-
eral Worth, and that of other gallant officers and
soldiers of our late army; and if the respect of
the committee is to be shown to $acflhn the same
manner, they would feel themselves bound to
recommend a bill for a general law, placing all the
widows of the officers and soldiers of" our army
upon the same basis. But the majority of the
committee are not prepared to take this step at
present, inasmuch as it would very materially in-
crease the amount,-already very large, wante'cl tor1
the annual payment of pensions, and would also
very materially change the principle upon which
our system of pensions is founded. But he said
he did not now rise to advocate the report of the
committee, but simply to state the principles upon
which it was placed; and having been requested
by the gentleman from Mississippi, [Mr. Feath-
EiisroN*,] who has the bill in charge, to allow him
to make a motion in relation to this report, he
cheerfully yielded to him the floor for that purpose.
Mr. FEATHERSTON suggested that the bill
should be referred to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, where it might be con-
sidered. And he move.d that it take that direction.
It was due, he said, to the character and services
of the late General Worth that it should have at
least respectful consideration.
The motion having been agreed to, the bill was
referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, and, with the accompanying
report, was ordered to be printed.
Mr. WALDO, from the Committee on Revolu-

cripple, and now asked from the Government the
small pittance provided for in the bill, as a means-
of meeting his necessities. As at present situated,
he had not the means of purchasing a Joaf of

ing was heard by the reporter.
The SPEAKER. The Chair cannot hear the

for anything he knew the bill might be a very prop-
| er subject- for the fa\orable action of Congress,
but he desired time and opportunity to examine
the bill and the report, which he presumed accom-
panied it; and he did not think that it was proper
to take up the time of the House in discussing the
merits of the bill in the morning hour. He, there-
fore, moved that it be referred to the Committee
of the Whole 06 the state:of the Union.
