Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS LINE OF THE SABINE,Niblett's Bluff, La., October 20, 1863.

Captain EDMUND P. TURNER, A. A. G., Houston, Tex.:

SIR: I have the honor to report my arrival at this post with the right, wing of my regiment (five companies) and one section of Captain Jones' light battery. More cavalry is absolutely needed here. We should have at least 400 or 500 horses from here to the Mermenton, to guard all ferries, roads, and by-roads, and to threaten the enemy's line of communication toward Opelousas, and, if possible, to inflict severe punishment on them.

The left wing of my regiment, the other section of Jones' and Lieutenant [A.] Robira's section of light artillery I hope will be here to-morrow. Neither the 32-pounder guns nor the two mountain howitzers mentioned in your telegram are here.

Inclosed herewith please find a dispatch just received from Captain B. P. L. Vinson, commanding company of the Second Louisiana Battalion, which I opened.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. BUCHEL,

Colonel, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have just returned from Franklin from a scout. I send you a correct report of Yankee forces passed through Franklin from the 1st to the 15th instant. This report is correct. There is great dissatisfaction among the troops, and great many wish to desert, thinking Texas is a hard road to travel. I brought a Yankee out of their lines, but I am compelled to deliver him, to send him to General Taylor.

I am, general, your obedient servant,
