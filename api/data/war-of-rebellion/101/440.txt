referred to in that letter, and have given them and will continue to give them all the protection that can be given without endangering more important objects. The subject has been one of anxious consideration, not only on account of the private interest involved, but more prominently on account of the welfare of the laborers employed on the plantations. I have herefore invited the attention of the authorities to the embarrassments connected with these interest, and I think it proper to add some facts showing the changes in the military relations that have occurred since this system was commenced: (1) Memphis, Vicksburg, and other important points on the Mississippi River were then not only strongly garrisoned, but there were heavy reserves at each point that were available for the protection of the plantations. (2) The reduction of the force in the Valley by transfers and by ordinary casualties (not less than 100,000 men) has reduced these garrisons to their minimum for safety, and has involved the necessity of abandoning some points that were of value in protecting the plantations, and of reducing the garrison of others. (3) Many of these changes were made before I came into the command. In those made by me I have followed the rule of breaking up or reducing the post that were of least value as military position, and the same rule will be observed in any changes that may hereafter be made. (4) The plantation interests extend over a frontier line, on both banks of the Mississippi and some of its tributaries, of nearly 3,000 miles.

The protection that might reasonably have been given eighteen months ago cannot reasonably be expected now, and a full compliance with the wishes of the planters would involve a ruinous subdivision of the force in this command. It would not secure the desired end, but would expose the detachments to be captured or destroyed in detail, involve the loss of the property on the plantations, and subject the negroes to the danger of being carried off int slavery. The most effectual means of protecting these interests are military operation that will drive the organized force of the rebels from the vicinity of the River and the organization of the planters into home guards for protecting themselves against raiding parties and jayhawkers, Arrangements that were being made some time since to effect the first of these objects have been suspended, by the necessity of employing the available cavalry force of the division in operations upon Hood's communications. They will be resumed as soon as possible, and I will at all times give the planters any aid that they may require in organizing and arming any force that can raise for local purposes. The points referred to in your communication are covered by existing orders, but I will renew them. I do not think, however, that it is wise to undertake more with regard to these interests that we have the ability to carry out, and I have carefully abstained from giving any encouragement to enterprises involving the investment of capital unless I felt assured that I could give them permanent protection. For convenience of reference I transmit with this copies of several papers bearing upon the subject, marked from A to E. *

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General.
