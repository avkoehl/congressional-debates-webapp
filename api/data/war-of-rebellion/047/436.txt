If an attempt be approved, batteries can readily be put in position on this side the river. Some pieces should, however, go over to John's Island.

HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, October 24, 1863.

Respectfully referred back for investigation as to practicability at this time, especially whether any ambush, such as that executed in case of the Isaac P. Smith, would not be discovered by enemy from their observations, and foiled with great hazard of disaster to us.

By order:

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

[Fifth indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS SECOND MILITARY DISTRICT,October 27, 1863.

Respectfully referred to Colonel Gonzales, chief of artillery, and Major Lucas, Lucas' battalion, who will meet to-morrow at Fort Pemberton and investigate the practicability of the design proposed by the latter, and report immediately to these headquarters.

By command of Brigadier-General Hagood, commanding:

HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF ARTILLERY,James Island, October 29, 1863.

Respectfully returned.

I was present on the Stono during the latter part of the shelling referred to by Captain Hayne, and examined, with Major Lucas, after the event, the position at Grimball's, James Island, where the siege guns were used against the Isaac P. Smith. The difference between the case of the former and the one now under consideration is:

First. The Isaac P. Smith was unforewarned, and, unsuspecting, came up as far as Grimball's, on James Island, and anchored. The present gunboat is suspecting and forewarned; does not anchor; remains but a few minutes, and considerably below (one reach) the position of the Isaac P. Smith.
