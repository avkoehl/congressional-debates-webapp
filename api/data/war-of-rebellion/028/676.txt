HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 22, 1862.

General JAMES LONGSTREET,Commanding,&amp;c.:

GENERAL: I wish you to direct General Walker's division to proceed to Paris, via Millwood, and to take post either at that place, Upperville, or on Crooked Creek, in the vicinity of Piedmont. It will be necessary to advise him to keep his pickets on the alert, and his command in readiness either for action or the march, as the enemy are in the habit of sending scouting parties from the Potomac and Fairfax Court-House, where they are said to be in force, as far as Aldie, Middleburg, and the Plains. General Stuart will be directed to advance his cavalry pickets toward Middleburg, and to notify General Walker of any movements of the enemy east of the Blue Ridge that may come to their knowledge. I desire General Walker, as soon as he reaches his destination, to send intelligent officers on the roads, via Markham and Piedmont, toward Warrenton, Orleans, and Washington, and to satisfy himself as to the best routes to Culpeper and Madison Court-House, so that he may move in either of those directions, as circumstances may require. I wish him also to make himself acquainted with the roads to Front Royal. In case of his being pressed by a superior force east of the mountains, he can retire toward Winchester or Front Royal, as the movements of the enemy in the valley may render requisite. His forage and provisions, if practicable, I wish drawn from Loudoun, Fauquier, and Rappahannock. Should it be necessary, he may draw his flour from the valley.

I desire that you will instruct him particularly to permit no straggling from his division must be purchases and paid for, and nothing must be taken until purchases by the proper authority. I desire him to keep himself in communication with Colonel Payne, who commands at Warrenton. He will, of course, repulse any advance of the enemy westward, whom he may engage with propriety, and will communicate andy movement of the enemy toward the Rappahannock of Richmond that he can discover.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 22, 1862.

Major General J. E. B. STUART,Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: General Walker's division is ordered to move to-morrow to Paris, and will take position in the vicinity of that place, Upperville, or Piedmont by Friday night. It will be necessary for you to advance your cavalry pickets, upon his arrival, toward Middleburg, with directions to report to him all movements of the enemy in their front. It would be desirable, if you could arrange it, to post a squadron of cavalry with General Walker to perform this picket duty, with direction to report to him.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
