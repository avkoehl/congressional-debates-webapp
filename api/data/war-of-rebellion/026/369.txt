afternoon of the 23rd, which resulted in the death of Colonel Jones, not being within the limits or against the forces of my command, I have no report concerning this to make. Most of the commanders who have made their reports to me unite with their commands in deploring the loss the department and the service have sustained in his death. As a soldier he was brave, stout-hearted, and untiring in his efforts; as a man, earnest, magnanimous, honorable, and devoted to his duty. He was never appalled by danger or overcome by incapacitating fear, but always sought to deal heavy and sturdy blows against the enemies of his country.

I desire mention in favorable terms the forces under my command. The Twenty-seventh and Fifty-eighth Regiments are deserving of praise for the patience with which they bore of fatigues of the night march and the gallant manner in which they charged upon and captured so many of the men. Lieutenant-Colonel Lyman speaks in approving terms of his officers and men. Lieutenant-Colonel Lyman speaks in approving terms of his officers and men. Lieutenant-Colonel Curtiss specially mentions Captain Clay, Company K, and Lieutenant Wells, Company I, for their energy, skill, and gallantry. I commend the Twenty-fifth Massachusetts for their high state of discipline and for the promptness and zeal which they displayed on all occasions. The Fifth and Forty-sixth Massachusetts manifested great enthusiasm to distinguish themselves and add to their character as regiments; had serious work been required of them I have no doubt they would have done it with spirit and determination.*

I have the honor to report the following number of prisoners and the following list of captured property as the fruits of the expedition: One hundred and sixty-five prisoners, 28 horses, 10 mules, 2 baggage wagons, 3 ambulances, 10 sets single harness, 6 artillery harness (complete), 11 saddles, 3 saddles (artillery), 9 bridles, 80 muskets, 80 sets of equipments, 11,000 rounds of ammunition, 1 12-pounder howitzer with limber.
