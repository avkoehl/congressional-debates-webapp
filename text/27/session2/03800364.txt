andnosoldiers." Nor would the Democratic patty acknow-
ledge itself to l>e a faction. Possdoly the Vicsñdent might get
enough from off íhe borders of that party to fill the offices he
had to give, but these would alway be the poorest and meanest
of all recruits.   [A laugh 1
So the President, must, after all, fall back on his Whig princ i-
plesand return to his Whig friends, (and they were very far
from desiring any such, accession,) or he tnüst content himself
to stand whcie he was, an object of the scorn and contempt of
i>ofh parties
The President was a disappointed man. He had abandoned
those who would have sustained him, and had foi frited the op-
portunity oí securing a lasting giory as tne benefactor of his
Country; and in place of this, had inflicted a de3p wound oa
the cause and hopes of liberty itself. Such a disappointment
aftereucha victory quenched the ardorof tlio people, and it
Tv uld be a long and a d.íñcult task to re km lie in then bosoms
the same ardor and united confidence which had roused them to
the deliverance of their country.
Mr. G. passed on to remark on the charge which was to us
observed m ths course of the Democratic patty in the Hoi^e
since the course of events "had inspired them with the hope of
soon regaining their lost power. Now they ws--e loud m then-
call for taxes' taws! They pressed 1>* a tariff bill, ana demand-
ed large appropriations lor tLfence. Why? Because the
Whig majority would bear the lesponsibiiity of layi-.g the
taxeg, and the whole benefir would, as they hoped, enure to
themselves. Formerly (hey had opposed a loan, because there
was no deficit on theTreasury. On, no; the Government con Id
get Along very well; but now they cried, .*w,iy with the com-
promise act—give us loans—eive us revenue—give us a new
tariff' Here was a full vindication oí the so much vilified
course of the Whigs at the uxua session No wU was admitted
that all the gieat provisions then m.-de were nscessaiy, and
were demanded by the exigencies of the people andthe Gioveru-
ment. The doctrine thu the public ¡amis ought not to be look*
ed to as a permanent sou ice o'f revea ue ha.i heen b^Id by the
greatest sages tiiat h*d adorned our his.ory; G-meral Jackson
himself had a Imute 1 thn; and even the gentleman from Virgi-
nia [Ur. VVisiijhad once made astmdar admission; though at
the time he made the speech he had, to be sure, been a little in-
toxicated. [5ír. Wise shctok his head,] It reminded hurt at a
remark oí an old geudeman who sod thedruiikenne&s wasno
excuse for words spoken; because a man when he was drunk
let out the secrets of his heart—[a laugh.] But now the gen-
tleman would vo'e no loan bill and no revenue bill till the Und:,
were res.oied to the Genera! Government.

had reduced their adversaries. While refusing to stand up
manfully in his defence, they possessed his private ear, flat-
tered him for actswhich prostrated the hopes of his paity, and
combined to oppose every measure they devised for the relief
of the country. White the Whigs were doing all they could
to give a just support to his adtriimsttadon, he turned every
engine agamst thfm, exulted in their defeats, and seemed to
long Tor their destruction.
ÍS.C. R. avowed it bis conviction, undersuch civumstances, to
be the duty and true policy of the Whig party openly to sepa-
rate themselves fiom such a man and run up another nag He
was tired of &uch a condition—held responsible for evoi y thin;?,
and able to effect nothing, and called onto desert their princi-
ples to follow a political pigniy. lie was asked where be
Wotiidgo"? He would tell gentlemen, hewouldgo toa confid-
ing and virtuous constituency; he would set before them the
true state oí the country, and tell them that if they wanted hirn
to serve them again, they must send him back free from ail par-
ty ties, andpiepaied to make war upon the cuirnptionsi.f all
rarties.
Mr. R. though foiled, was not m despair. The Wing p,^r-
ty yet existed in strength; and, though it might lose a iew by
the seductions of patronage, yet us hundreds of thousands
stood fast in their integrity. But the time was come when
the line between friends and enemies must be plainly and
luoadly diawn; when this was done, let no man taUcof dis-
banding, hut lift their banner to the breeze, and invoke the
spirit which in 1SÍ0 had given them victory and to the cotm'ay
hope.
They had now had a second edition of the Ty'.ej.* Admini-

And, like the first, it consisted mainly of autobiography de-
nunciations oí the Whig party and abu«e of Henry Clay.
The fume eternal ta'kmg of a m-m's self which had so long
and so often bored that House. They had gone out of their
way t) mrike a wanton attack on the Wh-g manifesto. But
vituperation and coarse abuse were not the weapons to resist
the force of truth; on the con'rary, they were ever the íesort
of weakness, vice, and corruption, lo piop the cause of tin
vu'jtar and obscene. Serpents could hiss, the loa hsome toad
could spit bis venom, and the demons of hell could curse the
bsiglu angels of light; though, thank God, they could not
dsag them down to their own dungeons—depths ot sorrow
andofpqin. They hat! not, however, veni-:ved to take is?ua
on any of the facts refer re 1 to in the manifesto, save as to ns
unanimous adoption by the meeting which published it- Mr.
JR.. insisted that u& adoption had been -new con. And though

Biu if thev h?d, what was there wrong in it? Here he went
mto the subject of the Presidential appointment's, complaining
that their bitterest enemies had been retained, while Whigsof
unexceptionable character were rejected; andeventbe old re-
jected nominees of General Jackson, and those whom General
Harrison had refused, had been favored with places by Mr. Ty-
ler. He had done the same in the States. In North Caiolina,
he had appointed two Virginians of the fi,st wa-er—one said to
be ddistant n lative of his own, Call the Tylers, it was said, had
royal blondín their veins, V-in the place oí two travelling ageats
of the Post Office Department, deceased.
On the subject of Mr. FiLLMOiia's reporting the measure re-
commended by the Secretary of the Treasury, of winch Mr.
Wise had so loudly com plained as an act of hostility to the Pre*
side!it, he asked Mr. W. if he meant distinctly to affirm that
that recommei.dation was an act for which the President him-
self and the rest of the Cabinet were net responsible [Mr. W.
made no reply.1 Had not the Madisoman revived the doctrine
of General Jackson that the Cabinet was a unit and the Presi-
dent responsible for the acts of all his officeri-1 If the measure
was such a stigma on the President, why did not the corpoiaPs
guard petition for the removal of the Secretary? Surely if that
officer had in his bosom a single spark of that honorable fire
which bad ammaipd the late retiring Cabinet, he would thiow
his commission m the President's face, and go home to his own
Pennsylvania.
Mr. K. biiefly adverted to a speech made by Mr. Charles
Brown of Pennsylvania, and ?aid that gentl man must have
bebeved himself addressing the people fiom the hustings of
Soudiwdrk or Moyameiismg, or he would not have charged the
Wing party with the responsibility ot' the prc&ent Administra-
tion. Did not that gentleman know that Mr, Tyler had aban-
doned the Whig party, through the (¡eductions of the Demo-
cratic party? Had not the gentlermn from Pennsylvania and
his friends seduced the President, and won him to their arms?
With what ti nth, then, could he nuke the Whig party responsi-
ble for the acts of the Administration? From the persuasive
power of the ceitleman fiom Pennsylvania, he had no doubt
but that gentleman had acted as the commissioner of the party
in the seduction of thePr-bideut.
Mr. BROWN ro^e and said, it the gen'leman from North
Carolina would ai'ow him, he would tc-li him all about the
seduction.
B'jt, Mr. R. said he feared,- if thegenf eman once got a-going,
b° might never stop: for he seemed to po-ie=s that quality of
matter which, once impelled onwauis, ha 1 no power to stop
itself. [_A- laugh ] ButU" the gentleman was so agitated with
disties? for a bleeding country let him and his fr ends go up
in a body to Mr. Tyler (as they did after ln:>rnsi veto) and inter-
cede with him for re'ief, Let them do this before the fast col-
lecting elements of combustión shnuld have buret into a flame.

After some cbt-t.nng remaiks a^ to the pro?pecf3of Whig
party, (on the nnncij'lr- that n was darkest just btlbre day,) Mr.
