His forces occupy about 300 tents, all except officers' being the common tent. Some may be in houses, but probably not many. This would make his force not more than 2,500, I think, and will agree with the story of wounded prisoners. We have credible information that they made the attack of the 3rd on the New River side with two regiments infantry and one of cavalry. Three regimental colors are flying in their camp. These facts corroborate the prisoners' story that their attack was
