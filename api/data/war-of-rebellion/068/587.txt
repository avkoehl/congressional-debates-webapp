Major-General BUTLER:

Advices from the front give reason to believe that General Grant's operations will prove a great success and complete victory. On Saturday night the enemy had been driven at all points, and Hancock was pushing forward rapidly to Spotsylvania Court-House, where heavy firing was heard yesterday. It was reported yesterday by a deserter that the enemy's only hope was in heavy re-enforcements from Beauregard.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 9, 1864-3.20 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

A bearer of dispatches from General Meade has just reached here by way of Fredericksburg; states that on Friday night Lee's army fell back, and yesterday were in full retreat for Richmond, Grant pursuing with his army. Hancock passed Spotsylvania Court-House before daylight yesterday morning. Meade's headquarters were yesterday at Todd's Tavern. We occupy Fredericksburg. The Twenty-second New York [Cavalry] occupied it about 8 o'clock last night.

Secretary of War.
