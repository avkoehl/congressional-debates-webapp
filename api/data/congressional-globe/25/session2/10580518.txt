In the Government wo dd cea^e its hostility to the banks, and
would íeceive and tieat as cnculation the bills of sound specie
paying banks, in a wou!, if it would m good faith, gr?e the
banks h confidence and countenance, it i1* my sincere convic
tion that they wou'd at once find themselves able to resume, but
they ca? not ree>nt the adverse power of the Government Sir,
Icannoi doubt that if n~ Government would give its support
to the proposal of Mr K v^s th b nks would at once resume,
and business wou d be levived
But he w long thinír-3 would thu& continue, would depend on
events which cannot befoies^en I ra ch fear ano her suspen
sion, wh never a more aiy piessuie shall come, or we shall
run largely mte debt ahioad \.x>y lung that shall set specie
m motion by rai&mgits value above papei, will provea very
disturbing cause Otir present purpose is, however, to get
back to specie payraen , and believj ig, as I do, that the Se*
nator's plan wdi as rt idily bung that event about as to
legalize the reception o nredeemable paper, I much preferit
The disturbing cui«e of ni ichl speak must necescanly recur
so often as the com e of fade shall creae heavy diafis on the
banks for specie This will derange boh the currency and
business We need, and have alwas u*ed, a much greater
capital in business than the specie in the country Of late, the
loans oí ba iks alone have amounted tb about five hundred
millions while the ^pcci"1 has not probab y (with extraordi
nary efforts to import and retain n) ever exceeded abouteighty
millions

and to pie^eive it fiom tho disastrous huctuatisns arising

i idebted to New Yoik, and the e was no medium of like value
m them all Mr President for the e reasons, while I am
most anxious for the resumption of specie paj ments, I cannot
vote foi this neasure
[Mr Niles argued with much ear^en'iies against the lecep
lion of the medeemable paper of the banks by the Go\eru

Mr Davis r id he knew very well tha he and the Senator

what surpuse! that the Sena ox s zeal should so much out

evils was, and now is, an exclusive metalliccutpeocy Now,
when the Administration adopts a measure designed k> work a
chance in the currency, ai d claims thatit has done it, will tha
Senator declare nei° that thei e has been no interference? Will
ho say there has been no change? No distiess? Sir if what
the Senator ¡see*, and hears will not convince him that there ha 
be n change and inteiferen~e and that theie is distress, no ar
g unent addressed b) me to him will work conviction Sir, the
Senator has spoken hastily, and is mistaken
M I> said that the Senator had contended we needed no cur
it-rnytopay off bal nces m the course of trade for they wer«
paid m produce What is thi&buteontendiuEr that 'hereareno
balances? If produce ppy&all, then there are no balances to b«
adj usted foi by balant ee we mean precisely what is left unpaid
by the interchange of trade m products
The Senator's argument proves too much, for if all debts can
be paid with produce, than we have no occasion for money, w«
neither want nor need it I am sure he is a little too well versed
m business to seriously attempt to maintain this ground We
all feel too ofien the want of money to contend that we hftv   *y
produce to supply its place
