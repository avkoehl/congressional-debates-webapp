the inland borler tiade, aril urerrd upon the Senate the
fairness, independent of the importance ol bestowing equal
attention upon the growing commeice of Mexico, through

be done, but that more attention and encouragement
should be given to our trade with the various Indian trines of
the West lie íefeired to the fnendiy intercourse keut up by
the British nadirs, with the In han tube*, within mir border ,

common Treas iry7 There \s-a« 1 Uai of $UOO0nOn
lecommended by the Senetaiv oí tbe rrea^my.anda bill for
which wa  nnv pending befoie this House, foi the purpose
of meeting the immediate wants of the Government Certain
lv this was not an evidence that there was a surplus in the
Ti easury to be given away
liy the repoit of the ¡Secretary of the Treasury, the esti
mated deficiency in the revenue for the years 184L and 1842 was
rather upwards of sixteen millions of dollars to meet the cur
rent expenditures, to which he (Mr H) thought might fairly
be added (as many gentlemen had contended at the last sea
stop) tbe claims 01 private individuals and of States which no
doubt were just, and had m part, been admitted to beso, pro-
bably to the amount of eight or ten millions more, malting
something like a debt of at least ®25,000,000, for which we were
now admittedly liable
It thus appeared manifest that there was a deficiency to the
amount 1 ertamiy of sixteen, and probably, of twenty five rrn!
li mis of dollars
But lubhonoiable fnend fiom Maryland [Mr Johnson] had
stated that if the expenses of the trust had been paid, and there
was a sui phis of the pioceeds, that surplus ought to be distri
butecUven lfthete was a general deficit m the Ti easury, because
these lands never had been considered as a source of national
revenue In ¡eflv to this position, he (Mr H ) would say that
evei since they wtie ceded to the United States these lands al*
wa>shad been eonsidcied and heated as a part of the common
revenue, and u ed as such As an evidence he would refer
to a leport fiom the Committee on Manufactures of the Senate,
m 1832 made ty an bonoiable gentleman then and now a mem
bei of that body from the fotate of Kentucky, [Mr Clay 1
l ee Senate l>tc 448, 1st sesbiou, 22d Congress ] That repoit
held the follón mg language
"Goverrun nt may employ the proceeds of the public lands
as a 1 art of the ordinal y 1 e\ enue, or in any other manner con-
sn ent with the Consti ution There may be revenue without
ta\uion Ihe íeport recommends distribution only because
they aie not w m'ed fer ordinary revenue "
Ileie then tlr II had high authority to sustain .him m the
ei c und he ha 1 taken ísrimet the position of the gen tit man irom
Mirjlatid [M Iohnson,] that these proceeds were considered
as íevenue to be dispc sed t f by Congress, m any manner they
might think j íoper subject to tbe conditions of the trust
I lie genUemin from Mar; land aigued that an empty Trea
«uiy was io a eument agam^ hsinbuiion and produced as an
instance of C ¡£íl sh virg exciciaed that j ov-ei previously,
tint, after he Revt 'utiomry war and when the Treismy wa«

ultimately piv them out of the common funds of the n iron

but of the whole nation Was not that a casein which the
Government not only could, but was oound to assume the pay
