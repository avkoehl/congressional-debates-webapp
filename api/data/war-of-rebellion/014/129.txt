HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 30-10 p.m.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War:

Opened upon Yorktown wharf to-day with Battery No. 1; drove off all their schooners and put a stop to all operations in that quarter. Result quite satisfactory. Work on new batteries progressing rapidly. Condition of roads renders it extremely difficult to get up the heavy guns and ammunition. Raining again to-day. Our first parallel now secure and flanks well covered. Enemy has fired considerably to-day, but I have not learned that any one was injured.

Major-General.
