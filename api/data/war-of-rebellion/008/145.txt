NOTE.- In the redan, Battery Numbers 1 but three guns were used against the attack of the enemy's fleet and during the bombardment of Island Numbers 10. This battery, commanded by Captain Rucker, had six guns. The three smooth-bore 32s were not fired; only the three 8-inch columbiads. The three latter guns in the redan and one other similar in Battery Numbers 5 have been mounted and ready for action for some two months past. The four 8-inch columbiads are guns that I brought down from the naval floating battery and mounted them immediately. Thirty-five guns have been mounted on platforms and in batteries since March 1 by the Engineer Corps, including the Sappers and Miners. The naval floating battery was placed by us in position on the north side of the island, and now mounts nine guns making, in all, fifty-two guns in position at the present time.

I am, very respectfully,

A. B. GRAY,

Captain, C. S. Army, Chief Engineer Island Numbers 10.

Major General JOHN P. McCOWN.
