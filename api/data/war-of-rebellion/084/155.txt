KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I shall cross to-night and leave the opposite side of the river for Platte City, via Parkville, at daylight in the morning. Have telegraphed to General Fisk's headquarters the same. Will be pleased to meet and co-operate with your forces at that point. Will they be there; if so, how many?

JAMES H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Will be at or near Platte City at 10 or 11 o'clock to-morrow morning. Will try and keep you advised all the time. To prevent collision, I would suggest that upon the approach of troops that a bugler from each party ride forward. My command will challenge by sounding the "rally" to be answered by the other party sounding "water call." I have sent the same to General Fisk.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS:

I will be at Platte City by 11 o'clock to-morrow unless I find the enemy on the run; in that case I shall follow him up.

J. H. FORD.

Colonel, &amp;c.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Colonel FORD:

General Fisk desires me to take the direction so as to combine efforts. I hope to get another steamer to you before day. If not, perhaps you better get on her when she meets you. I fear the march will render your force weary and unfit for action at 11 or 12 to-morrow. If any other steamer comes take here to your aid. Operators will please keep open with some one to rouse when instrument calls so my plans can be completed. I have telegraphed Captain Holloway to move immediately to Weston.

S. R. CURTIS.

Major-General.

SAINT JOE, July 12, 1864

Colonel FORD,

Kansas City:

Have you decided upon a programme? We are ready and waiting your pleasure.

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
