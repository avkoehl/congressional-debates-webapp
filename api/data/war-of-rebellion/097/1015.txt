Returned from Lewisburg. We paroled thirty-nine officers and about 600 men. Are going back again the 10th of May. The rebellion in that section has withered away. The people are tired of war and ready to quit.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, April 30, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I would respectfully recommend the appointment by brevet of Brigadier General Charles Devens to the rank of major-general of volunteers. He has proven himself one of the most gallant and devoted officers, keeping with his command always when it was in the field and when he was in a condition rendering him entirely unable to walk or ride on horse-back. As General Devens will probably be quitting the service soon, I would ask early action.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
