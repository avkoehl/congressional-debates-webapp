BATTERY PETTIT,

Falmouth, Va., December 17, 1862.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that on Wednesday, the 10th instant, I was notified that I would receive orders from you, and, in compliance with such orders, the following day, as soon as the fog cleared away, I opened fire upon the enemy's batteries that were shelling the bridge, firing during the day 130 rounds. Friday, I opened upon the same objects, and fired 350 rounds. On Saturday, I was ordered to direct my fire wherever I could see the enemy's infantry, or upon their batteries. I did so with apparent good effect, firing during the day 700 rounds. Sunday, I fired 100 rounds at the enemy's batteries that were shelling the city. On Monday, I fired 50 rounds at the same objects. On Tuesday, I was ordered by General Sumner to open upon the enemy's infantry whenever they showed themselves. I discovered them stripping our dead, and fired 12 rounds at them, when I received orders to cease firing until further orders. No casualties to report on our side.
