HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

Guns can be placed at the point named if directed well. See General Wright, who is at the front, about it immediately.

C. H. TOMPKINS,

Colonel and Chief of Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I am in possession of the position from which Upton was driven this afternoon, and am occupying it with the First and Third Division. The Second I hold near Anderson's to cover the left flank. I shall not attempt bringing artillery farther than Anderson's on account of the unusual difficulties of the ground between the two position. I beg to call attention to the danger of the enemy's moving to our left the Spotsylvania and Massapanox road, either for attack on our flank and rear or to secure a position on the Fredericksburg line. This idea is somewhat borne out by statements of prisoners that the force which attacked Upton, and represented variously as from 1,000 to 3,000 strong, moved off in an easterly direction-that is, by the Massaponax road. I should remark that General Ayres with his brigade, Fifth Corps, had possession of this position when I reached it.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.- If my suppositions as to enemy's movements are correct, this force should be brought back beyond the Ny river to-night. The dept of the stream generally is above the waists of the men, and the country exceedingly broken and tangled.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 14, 1864-8.40 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Sixth Army Corps:

You had better have roads opened to your rear from your advanced position, also toward the Fifth Corps.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

P. S.- You have been confirmed.
