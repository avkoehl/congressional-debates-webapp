HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 13, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM GLENNY,

Commanding Fourth Brigade:

COLONEL: The brevet brigadier-general commanding the division directs me to say that the work on the curtain on the right of Fort Sampson, as well as that on the dams, goes on very slowly; in fact, hardly anything is accomplished. The regiments at work on the breast-works, it is expected, will be excused from other duty, and kept at work, commencing in the morning and continuing until 5 p.m. Details are ordered to report at the dams daily, sufficiently strong to do the work in a short time, but they are not kept at work, and but little is accomplished. You will please have competent officers placed in charge, and also give your personal attention to the work, in order that it may be properly finished at the earliest possible moment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. A. BROWN,

Major and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 13, 1865-10 p.m.

Major General JOHN GIBBON:

An order will be sent to you immediately to report to the lieutenant-general commanding for assignment to the Twenty-fourth Army Corps. Please make your arrangements to report as soon as possible, and receive my hearty congratulation.

GEO. G. MEADE,
