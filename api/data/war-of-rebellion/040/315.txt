Major-General HEINTZELMAN,

Commanding, &amp;c., Washington, D. C.:

If General Stahel can extend his patrols to the vicinity of Rappahannock Station, it will greatly facilitate operations here. Our cavalry force are all across the Rappahannock with infantry, and there is no probability of anything very serious from the enemy interfering with the performance of this duty int his direction. If your operations and duties will permit it, the general would like to be advised that it can and will be done for two or three days.

Major General JOSEPH HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

We are invested at Suffolk by a superior force, but are getting stronger every day. I returned from there last evening. If the enemy attacks, he will fare badly. A successful movement on your part, for which we are all most anxious, will be of great service to us by preventing Longstreet from being further re-enforced, and may compel him to withdraw.
