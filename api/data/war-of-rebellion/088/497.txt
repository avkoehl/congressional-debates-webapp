Brigadier-General GREGG,

Commanding Second Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Hancock directs me to say that he has decided to send out a force toward the enemy's supposed position at the fork of the stage and Reams' Station roads, to ascertain whether any infantry is in our front, and, if possible, to drive away the enemy's cavalry, in order to give us earlier information should any considerable force advance. The general will give you a good brigade of infantry with all of your own force you can get together, and wishes you to arrange the necessary preliminaries before he sees you. He will be at your headquarters during the course of an hour.
