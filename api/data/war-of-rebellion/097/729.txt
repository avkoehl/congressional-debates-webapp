Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I am ordered to Richmond forthwith and break up at this point. I have nearly 7,000 recruits and convalescents for the Army of the Potomac. The Massachusetts cavalry, with three regiments of Collis' command, can march these men up to the Army of the Potomac. The moment he leaves there will be no force here to guard them. Can General Collis be instructed to take charge of them till they are turned over at the front? I can see no other mode of disposing of them. This is the course suggested yesterday by General Grant. Please reply immediately.

M. R. PATRICK,

Provost-Marshal-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 13, 1865-4.20 p. m.
