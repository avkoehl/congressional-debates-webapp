By Mr. SHERWOOD: The petition of
Cyrus Sunderlind and 24 others, of Tioga and
Potter counties, Pennsylvania, asking the pas-
sage of House bill No. 1738.
IN SENATE.
Wednesday, May 22, 1872.
The Senate met at three o'clock p. m.
Prayer by Rev. E. D. Owen, of Washington,
District of Columbia.
Mr. CAMERON. I move that the reading
of the Journal be dispensed with.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the reading of the Journal will be
dispensed with. The Chair hears no objec-
tion.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I ask the Senate, as they
have kindly consented for two days before, to
take up the moment the regular morning
business is through with the apportionment
bill, in order that we may complete it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. We can decide that
when we get through with the morningbusiness.
It seems to me this is the very time that the
Journal ought to be read if it is made up. We
ought to know what the proceedings of last
night were.
Mr. CAMERON. The motion which I will
make will show probably to the Senator. I
shall make a motion immediately to go into
executive session, and in the meanwhile the
Clerk will have time to make up the Journal of
yesterday. Certainly he has not yet had time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair did
not understand the Senator from Illinois to
object, but if lie did the Journal must be read.
Mr. CAMERON. He does not object, I
think.
Mr. TRUMBULL. We shall get through
the Journal probably in a few minutes. I do
not know that it will be very long; but I think
we ought to know what the Journal is of
such sessions as we had yesterday.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair did
not hear objection, but the Senator states that
he made it. That is sufficient for the Chair.
The Journal therefore must be read. Its read-
ing can only be dispensed with by unanimous
consent.
The Journal of yesterday's proceedings was
read.
Mr. TRUMBULL. In listening to the Journal
I did not hear any note of the order of the
Senate to send for absentees.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Illinois moves to correct the Journal.
Mr. TRUMBULL. No; 1 only called atten-
tion to the fact that I did not hear in the read-
ing of the Journal any notice of the order to
send for absentees. I understand there was
such an order.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Does the Senator speak
from his own knowledge ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think I oughtto have
some knowledge of it when an officer came to
me and stated the fact.
Mr. EDMUNDS. 1 thinkthatissatisfactory
evidence.
Mr. POMEROY. There was such an order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator from Illinois move to correct the Journal ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. I should like to know
whether I was awakened in the night without
authority of the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state that he i3 informed by the Senator from
Michigan, [Mr. Ferry,] who was presiding
at the time, that a motion was made by the
Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Anthony]
requesting absent Senators to appear in the
Senate Chamber, and it was agreed to. It
was found that there had been a quorum pres-
ent on the previous roll-call, and it was a
question in the Secretary's mind whether the
case came within the eighth rule, which pro-
vides that " no Senator shall absent himself
from the service of the Senate without leave
of the Senate first obtained. And in case a
42d Cong. 2d Sess.â€”No. 236.
less number than a quorum of the Senate
shall convene, they are hereby authorized to
send the Sergeant-at-Arms, or any other per-
son or persons by them authorized, for any or
all absent Senators," &c. But the Senator
has a right to have the Journal corrected.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I do not care about it.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I was not in
when the Senator from Illinois made his point.
I should like to know what it was.
The VICE PRESIDENT. ' There was no
motion to correct the Journal.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I was awakened, and I
wanted to know whether it was by authority
of the Senate. Perhaps the Senator .from
Michigan can tell.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I will merely
answer the Senator by sayicig that I did not
know the Senator was awakened j but the offi-
cer was authorized to awaken all the Senators,
or notify them that the Senate desired their
presence.
Mr. CAMERON. In corroboration of what
the Senator on my right said, I will say that I
was awakened a little before two o'clock this
morning, and I responded; that is, I got out
of bed and came here and remained.
supplemental apportionment bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I ask the Senate the
moment the morning business is gone through
with to take up and finish the apportionment
bill that has been so long under consider-
ation.
_ The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to that proposition? The Chair hears
none.
