MACON, MO., October 18, 1864.

Captain FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The lines on the Hannibal and Saint Joseph are cut, and I expect, from information received, that Colonel McDaniel (rebel) is below Shelbina. I have just ordered an engine from Brookfield; shall send troops to see what is the matter. Will report if anything turns up.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE BORDER,Camp Charlot, October 18, 1864--1.35 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Jefferson City:

Have published information to show necessity of Kansas militia to rally. Your dispatches have been used for that purpose--I hope not to your injury. My advance took Lexington yesterday. Rebels had been there and sacked the city, but fell back toward Waverly. My advance also entered Warrensburg yesterday and got telegraphic news from Sedalia. No rebels on that line; they seem to have gone toward Lexington.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 18, 1864--3 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS,

Kansas City:

As I telegraphed you last night, a division of infantry occupy Sedalia; our cavalry at Dunksburg, on the Blackwater. So soon as they get rations they will move forward. Price reported to have staid night before last at Waverly. Mower's division will be at La Mine bridge to-night, with its batteries probably fit for action. Sanborn will have received supplies to-day by 12 m. and will move his right by Elmwood and Elk Grove and his left by Cook's Store toward Lexington. With these dispositions, combined with yours, it seems to me we can push the old fellow and make him lose his trains. His horses' feet must be in bad order for want of shoes.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
