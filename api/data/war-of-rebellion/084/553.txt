(Received 9.20 p.m.)

Major CHRISTENSEN:

The enemy is in force on the Port Hudson road. I have this from four different sources, and I believe that he will attack me. I am making every preparation to receive him without any alarm or stampede.

W. P. BENTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

I do not know what force the rebels can bring against Baton Rouge. The recent accounts from Clinton and Woodville give but a small force at either of those places, the bulk of the troops having gone to Mobile. General Lawler will be instructed to re-enforce General Benton, if necessary, and any disposable force here might be sent up.
