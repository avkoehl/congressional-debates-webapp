HOLLY SPRINGS, November 5, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Enemy have not advanced to-day. Jackson drove in their pickets at 10 o'clock. Think probable that they only intend to hold and fortify La Grange. Shall I drive them off?

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

Colonel R. F. LOONEY, Holly Springs:

In answer to your dispatch of this date I am directed by Lieutenant-General Pemberton to inform you that Partisan Rangers can be raised within the enemy's lines in Tennessee, with Governor Harris' approval, who will indicate the counties. After this has been accomplished you can refer the subject to this office for final action; the raising of the company to be limited to the 1st day of December by law.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Forwarded from Jackson.)

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Our forces all in motion, which may create a diversion in your favor. My cavalry in North Alabama ordered to observe the enemy and harass his rear. Wrote you to-day.

Major-General PRICE, Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Send for your provision wagons at once. We will not fall back unless the enemy advance in force. We will bivouac for a day or so to see what will be done. Send in requisition for provisions, using a few wagons to haul them. The main part keep for the present at Price's camp.

The enemy do not seem to be advancing; on the contrary, have fallen back to original line on Wolf River. Keep out infantry pickets on road in front and right flank.

Yours, &c.,

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
