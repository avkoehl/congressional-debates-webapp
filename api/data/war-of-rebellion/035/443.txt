Buckner's presence at Big Creek Gap, and the possibility that Morgan's crossing may be intended to draw everything from Buckner's front, ought to be considered.

Cavalry had previously been ordered to be in readiness. Michigan cavalry was at Mount Sterling; it has been ordered to Hickman Bridge.

I will relieve Colonel De Corcy from command of troops unless you otherwise direct.

General BOYLE, Ky.:

The military commandant at New albany reports that 900 rebels crossed the river to burn the bridges on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. They were reported near Paoli this morning. Have you heard anything of them? I have ordered General Willcox to place a regiment of infantry on the cars for Seymour, thence to be carried out on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

The military commandant at New Albany reports that 900 rebels crossed the river yesterday morning, with the object of burning the bridges on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. They were reported within 5 miles of Paoli at 5 o'clock this morning. I am satisfied that the number is an exaggeration. Please have a train ready at once to carry the Seventy-first Indiana to Seymour, where the Ohio and Mississippi will be ready to transport them out on their road. Let them be ready to start within an hour. You will receive a dispatch from me within that time. Have you heard anything of this band? Answer at once.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Major-General HARTSUFF, Lexington, Ky.:

Keep all your cavalry ready to move at a moments' notice. If Morgan attempts to enter Kentucky he must be pursued and broken to pieces,
