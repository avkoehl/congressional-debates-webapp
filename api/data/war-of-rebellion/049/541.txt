HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,December 4, 1863-10.15 a.m.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:

COLONEL: One brigade of the division is now posted at Sheppard's Grove Post-Office, picketing Germanna and Jacobs' Fords, and connecting with the pickets of the Third Division on the right. The other brigade is at Richardsville picketing the lower fords and the Rappahannock. Nothing demonstrative on the part of the enemy. Bushwhackers have begun operations in the rear. I have ordered a force to be crossed at Richards' Ford to go to United States Ford. The force sent yesterday went by Morrisville to Hartwood; hence my report of the distance of 22 miles. The distance to Hartwood from Richardsville is 12 miles by way of Richards' Ford. The road between this point (Sheppard's Grove Post-Office) and Richardsville is very bad. If the enemy's cavalry attempt anything, it will be on the north bank of the Rappahannock. I will send the report of operations as soon as I shall have gotten reports from brigade commanders.

Respectfully, yours,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier General of Vols., Commanding Second Division.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 4, 1863-3.15 p.m.
