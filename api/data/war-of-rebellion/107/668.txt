FRONT ROYAL, June 9, 1862.

Major-General McDOWELL,

Washington, D. c.:

I have received your telegram respecting the cipher telegrams.* There ae required for the artillery of Rickets's division 70 horses, for the cavalry 309 horses. Lieutenant Fessenden is in that part of the Maine battery now with General Bayard. The Rhode Island cavalry commadner moves slowly, and perhaps we may get his report nex week with luck. I shall send it as soon as received. A portion of troops from General Banks arrived last night on the other side of the river but that is all I can report of them now.

E. SCHRIVER,

FRONT ROYAL, June 9, 1862.

General RICKETTS,

Commanding Division:

Major-General McDowell directs all movements of your division ordered yesterday to be suspended until further instructions.

E. SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff.

FRONT ROYAL, June 9, 1862.

General RICKETTS:

It is the direction of General McDowell that you move you division on the Luray road to the most defensible position in the vicinity of Chester Gap. If not a band position, it would be better, the general says, to be beyond the gap so as to keep open the road from Warrenton. The general says let Major Houston, Engineers, go with General Ricketts, but I am sorry to say he is not here. If you direct if, I will telegraph him to come here.

E. SCHRIVER.

FRONT ROYAL, June 9, 1862.

Brigadier-General BAYARD,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

I have just received you communicaton of 7th instant to Major Breck # and shall telegraph its contents to Major-General McDowell now in Washington. You are not to remain in Generalo Fremont's department, but, as soon as possible, repair to this department. In writing to General Shields some time ago and General Fremont, both those general's attention was asked to your return. I have not copies of the letters by me (the rest of the staff being at Manassas), but I think it was directed that you should join General Shield's command and move hitherward with him. I know you are to return to this department.

I am sorry to hear of the misfortun of Wyndham and Kane.

ED. SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff.
