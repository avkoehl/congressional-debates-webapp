NEAR NEW HOPE CHURCH, GA., June 2, 1864-6.30 p.m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

Inclosed I send you dispatch from my signal officer. The point over which the enemy was seen to pass is one and three-quarters to two miles distant in a south-southeasterly direction from the signal station, which is half a mile south of my headquarters. I have ben listening attentively since receiving your last dispatch for the sound or battle on our left, and have sent my staff officers up to your headquarters, but could not learn anything that would indicate anything like a battle, consequently did not open my artillery. Major-General Logan reports that he has advanced his skirmishers all around his lines until they receive the fire from the rebel works. Some of the enemy's cavalry followed Brigadier-General Veatch over toward Owen's Mill and opened upon him with artillery (one piece), to which he replied, when they disappeared.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.- The train from Kingston is in all right, having crossed Pumpkin Vine Creek at Russum's Mill. I have moved my train this side of the Pumpkin Vine and farther to the north, and shall draw Veatch's division in somewhat, but at the same time control the road leading up from the south on the west side of Pumpkin Vine to Burnt Hickory.
