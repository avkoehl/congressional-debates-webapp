JACKSON, July 30, 1862.

General McCLERNAND, Bolivar:

I have the following information, which I give you. It is contained in a note from

-------

:

The most of Jackson's cavalry were at Whiteville on last Saturday, 4 miles the other side of Estanaula, and are all this side of the river now, and are directed to cut off communication between here and Columbus and attack points that are weak.

This information I think is reliable.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, July 30, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

Your dispatch concerning Whiteville this minute received. I had a force there late yesterday evening.

Two regiments rebel cavalry are reported to have fallen back in from direction of Estanaula by Whiteville.

I do not think there is much of any rebel infantry east of the Hatchie nor a large cavalry force. This is, however, given as an opinion, but not as a fact.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

JACKSON, July 30, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

I have sent every cavalryman that is able to ride, under Colonel McCullough, to support Colonel Hogg. Major Stewart is not able to go. The enemy are in force, I am pretty well satisfied, and I am re-enforcing ont he railroad between here and Humboldt, or shall do so as son as I can get cars. I am satisfied Jackson will make a dash somewhere on the road unless Colonel Hogg can hold him in check.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, July 30, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

You are right in supporting Colonel Hogg as much as possible. I wish Major Stewart, as my chief of cavalry, to accompany the cavalry. You ought to support by an infantry demonstration toward Denmark, if the enemy are still in that direction.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

BOLIVAR, July 30, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

You, being on the ground, must determine whether you will re-enforce your guards by railroad or marching on foot. I would adopt the most expeditions way of doing it. Act boldly, but carefully. You say the enemy are in force; cavalry or infantry, or both?

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.
