auy share in seul ng the terms of compromise Hj
certamly had not entertained any such views, much
le6s entered into any ofehgat ons in regard to ihe
dispo al cf public lands revenue He believ-
ed he had then, and alnavs when ths question
came up, voted against the distribution bill He
should continue to do so url^ss it was made per
fect]y clear to his mmd that the duties under the
compromiSv bill would meet all the pabl c exigen
cíes, and leave notb ng to apprehend as to the e -
tabltshmen of a permanent public debt
Mr CLAY of Alabama sa d he was a memUr
of the other branch of Congress when the c^a pro-
mi e bill was under discussion, and no member of
thatt-ody uttered an intimation to countenance the
grot, id now boldly as unied by the Senate r from
Kentucky He said the land distribution had been
the topic of d scuss on at every Congress since ihe
compromise sai pa scd, and it was amaz ng that
some of ihe f le-nds of the me as a re had not men-
tioned this agreement, now set up as part of the
compromise, in support of the distribution scheme,
from that hour until it was brought forward at the
ptesent moment The c >ropromiseact, every body
knows, was insisted upon on one si^e How
comes it that the other sid , now c'aimmg to dis-
tribute the land revenues in virtue of it, had neter
brought up the faith plighted in the tariff arrange-
ment, to enforce their demands'! He cc nsidered
the suggestion of it now, for the first tune, to be
an after thought
Mr WRIGHT stated, as he was a member of
th Senate when trie cómprense was adjas'ed, h 
fe t it his duty to s ate his impiessi >rs m regard to
the p< nt now made by theS nator fiom Kentacky
He knew that the land distribution bill was p-nding
whiie the compromise act w s u ider con id laLon,
bat he never h^ard the idea sugaei ed hat ihe one
dfpenued upon the o her, or tnít th^re w- h° leps
expeclatio i t lat the distribution of he Und¿ wju d
be the con'equ-nc of the compromi e On the
Cun'rary, he was one of those who confidently ex-
pected that the land distribution bill would bs de
feated, as it was defeated No one had looked upon
the defeat of the distribution b 1', as any breach of
the understanding under which the compromise act
passed
Mr W. did not think the language of the com-
promise act quoted by the Senator from Kentucky,
would bear the interpretation he had given to it.
He loo-jed upun th  words providi g that "such
dulus shouU be laid for Ike purp?se if the ret mg if

ea'culanon  and views under th* act w^re it-unaed
in hi-, Jtp rt on the bypoihesu that the proceeds cf
those lands wets n t to b° given aw3. The ex-
p ct uon was, that only so mi eh would b re-
qa r d , rom customs, as after applying l e met me
ii m unds and any misceuaneo ¡s resource,
wou'd be found nece «ary, m addition to them, f .

which were "lee ed instead of 1839, as th se last
were unusually high, and instead of 1837, which
\vcre unnsua 1/ low
The present Secretary of the Treasury, by ano-
ther mode or computation, has arrived to asimilar
result, tha'th tar ff a tei the reduct ons of next j
year, would yied only ten (r ei ven mil'i ms, with
cut reiereuce to any new laws .or n-w mode of
valuation, which, as hereafter shown, would have
considerable influence, though not si much if the
ta-iff was changed, a"! th" Senator fiom Kentucky
had intimated certainly not so much, if the tariff
was raised on most articles as high as 80 per cent
as is proposed by the new bill on that subject
But now passing that by, add to the eleven mil-
lions three or tbiee and a halt for land^—making
fourteen or fourteen and a half millions, and it was
then supposed, that unless the expenditures we e
reduced, quite five mi 'ions more reí en e might be
needed to crv r ¿n expendituie o£ eighteen to
twtntj ~ i 1 ens
Yet ill could see that five mill ons more with-
out th° lands would not pay an expenditure of
ei her eights en or twenty mi lion , but only six
teen millions. This «nowed conclus vely, that
the Treasury Dspaitment never construed the
compromise act as intending ?fter this year to
supply all our revenue from customs
'Ihe gentlemen opposite bad held out promises of
rcduung the aggregate expendí «resdown even to
thnteen millicn , and some to fifteen Yet Mr
W had computed that they were not likely,
under the past Administration, to fall much if
any below eighteen millions
But should the present Administration redeem
the momises and ple'gcs ofieducton, so as to
come dü\ n to fifteen mil ion , which Mr W
wculd rejoice to v itr 'i, then indeed tne lands
would hardly be needed Ben. net till tnen And
when this Administration fulfilled su'u flattering
premises and pledges as v e 1 as several others
stt 1 unpei'c mtd, they would 'es rve the cortmu-
aace of publ c confides e much more than he ap

oo h to vie la e the corrpromi e and run argel/ m
debt W y shoul i we net then suppe tt the amend-
ment proposed by ihe gentleman from Alabama,
and at least pay all the debts au'hisrized at this
session, before? giving away a large por i m of our
permanent revenues'! Let ns act for others as we
would for ourselvts. L-t us exercise on public
matters a little of the plain common sen<e pru-
eient people would exercise in their private affairs.
And when already in debt—as suthotized by the
loan bill, twelve million , and ten to rift! en as au-
trfoiizedby the Bank bil1—let us rot be prodigal
of our resources ti'l the debts incurred and incur-
ring are ducharged
We are increasing our expenditures instead of
retrenchment. We are looking to a higher tariff
as well as a larger debt in peace for relief. Why
thsn evince the rashness, the exceeding folly, to
give away out available means ti'l we see to a
ceitainty what, if any thm?, can be spared? Wait,
sir, till another year, when estimates and conjectures
will cease on this quevtion, and when, by recorded
facts, we shall be ab'e to dec de judiciously
whether all our existing means is nl not be needed
for our own purposes
Indeed, sir, we snail ptovs very fortunate, after
giving away the lands, and running in debt this
j ear near twenty eight millions, and raising the
tariff near nine millions, as already proposed, if we
can s op there. No, sir, we are likely still to find
adeficenoyof quite se/en to eight millions more
to be made up by an open, niked, and undisguised
violation of the compromise of 1833 Some of the
friends of the Administration have admitted in the
other House .hat it must be violated if the lands
are given away Such is the express acknowledge-
ment in a speech published yesterday
If the current expense!, are to be swollen to near
$28,000 000, a* before explained, we must add to
them next year the interest on ti e twelve million
loan, equal at least to $600,000 The mfrest on the
Bank uebt must also be paid, as no dividers will
probably be received to meet it the f>0t > ear. That
must be on s!Xtcen and two-thi ds'nullwr , at 5
¡■er cent ft1",3.3,333 more Xiese const, u e a
charge on the Treasury equal to about twenty-nine
and a half million The twelve million debt is
al=o to be paid off m three or four years by its
'eiras, and m a time of peace should bo extinguish-
ed at the ra e yearly of at iea«t three millions, so a<?
net to fah all on one or two years, ard thus lead to
another loan
The agrégate expenditure woule4 hen be near
thirty-two and a half millions How is this to be
met? Suppose the lands are piven away
and nothing received except from duties
in 1841, and he amount cimpuled by the
S creiary of ihe Tieasury and the chairman of the
Cimtt i tee of Way  ai.d M°ans in ihe House of
Representative is only j$0 000,000. Yes, sir,
$20 000 000 io pay §32 OOu 000
But, for the next year, I concede that there wilt
probably be increased receipts between January
and Julj— when the last reduction happens—equal
to near two and a half m 1 ions me re, provided the
p-csent tariff, wheie above 20 per cent ton innes
unaltere i, anl ■> rew one is p ss d r^isirg a tides
fret, and under 20 percent t> tale tfkct by the
Is of January n>.xt Some doubt the correctness
of doing this so soon une er tin cotaproin e But
if it succeeds, the nctt dunes en the estimated one
huidrcd and twenty-five millions of dutiable im-
ports wculd be neai twenty two and a half mil-
j 1 ons There is to be no addition to th « fir w-
' creasul' dutiable impor s ab we he one hundred
and twenty five millions, proviisd the cutíes are
raised „o h gh On the contrary, reduced mports
are more piobable Nor is any addition to be made,
as intimated by the chairman opposi e, on account
of drawbacks co reeled, and judicial decisions
amended, which have exempted articles tint ought
to be taxed Btcause all that is effected bv raising
the dunes to 90 per cent ge-n rally, and by the di-
mini h-d estimate for draw backs
The only other addit on m st be on account ot
the home valuation. Baf tlus does no* take effect
at all t«l' the middle of next jear, ?nd ti n if 20
per cent be adopted, ai recommen^d by the
Comptroller last «inter—if civems* also the
charges of importation—it wculd ro probably
exceed 15 per csnt. on what is the value, as com-
puted now
