Camp Osborn, December 24, 1861.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis.

DEAR GENERAL: I send you the proclamation which I had caused to be issued for this rebellious district and which I think is producing a very salutary effect. This is reported the most wealthy county in the State outside of Saint Louis and has been built up with the products of the soil sold to the Government at Fort Leavenworth. I have sworn in about 800 citizens and I have two arrested for stating that they did not regard the oath.

Colonel, Commanding this District.
