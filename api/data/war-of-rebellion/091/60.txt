Captain A. E. DANA,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Cavalry Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that I assumed command of this brigade last night. Proceeded this morning with the brigade up the Opequon. I have burned all the mills (three in number) from Smithfield to the railroad, except a small one below where we struck the stream, which will be dealt with at once in a like incendiary manner. We met opposition at each point, but prevailed on the enemy to leave. We have captured 1 lieutenant and 5 men, who will be sent to your headquarters. I am returning to my camp. My loss was nothing.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED GIBBS,

Colonel First New York Dragoons.

No change of position of infantry reported to-day. Averell has moved his command this side of Opequon, making Leetown his headquarters. A squadron of his command was in Martinsburg this evening. Scouts from there, just arrived, report no enemy below Bunker Hill.

Brigadier General J. D. STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that he wishes the road repaired through to Martinsburg, but he does not want any trains of cars whatever run through until orders are given from these headquarters. I have also to inform you that on account of the rise in the Potomac River, rendering the ford at Williamsport impracticable, General Averell was obliged to swing his right round toward Leetown.

Very respectfully,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
