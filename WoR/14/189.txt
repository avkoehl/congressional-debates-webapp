A surgeon or assistant surgeon will march with the rear guard of each brigade, while duty it will be to examine every man who leaves the ranks and remains behind. If he is unable to march he will be placed in an ambulance; otherwise the rear guard will take him prisoner and force him to go forward.

General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General:

I am preparing to ship forward my troops to Suffolk and beyond, depending on circumstances. Most of my troops are in advance of Norfolk. If General McClellan should be driven back, I shall stand
