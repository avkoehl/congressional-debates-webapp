By command of Major-General Breckinridge:

JOHN A. BUCKNER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS BRECKINRIDGE'S DIVISION,Near Knoxville, October 12, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

GENERAL: I have just received intelligence which compels me to write to you in this irregular way. I send this by courier to overtake Captain [James] Nocquet.

By orders from Richmond, I am to leave all the Tennessee here. General Jones will send them forward to operate against Nashville; possibly to defend Murfreesborough or Chattanooga. The reserve at Corinth complicates matters.

I started Brigadier-General Maxey this morning, via Cumberland Gap and London, with over 5,000 men, and will follow on Tuesday, the 14th, with 1,500 Kentuckians and two batteries. This includes the Second Kentucky, Colonel Hanson, with Graves' battery, being exchanged prisoners. Please save me a good command. I bring but 1,000 of my old division, but they are excellent troops.

I hope you are satisfied with my energy since I was allowed to leave Grand Junction. I have encountered every difficulty a man could meet, and but for some transportation I clung to and brought with me, would be wholly paralyzed.

Very truly,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. BRECKINRIDGE'S DIVISION,No. 38. Knoxville, October 12, 1862.
