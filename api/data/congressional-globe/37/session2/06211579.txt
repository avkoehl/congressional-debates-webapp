Showing an aggregate of §14,047,154 02 for five
years, or $2,809,430 80 per annum. By reference
to the note appended to the return itwillbefound
that the Secretary of War adds;
"Large expenditures appertaining to this statement have
been made at New York for California, at New (Means (or
Tcxa*, and other points in the Ea^t foi Utah and Now Mex-
ico, the exact amount of which cannot be a^eei tamed ex-
cept by lcfeienec to the vouchors m the office of the Third
Auditoi of the TreaMiiy, and which cannot be done with-
out causing great delay."
The " large expenditures" referred to in this
note, and which arc not included in the return,
may be explained by the fact that the freight con-
tracted to be delivered by Russell, Majors & Co.
to certain posts in TJtah, Nebraska, Kansas,and
New Mexico, is not included in quartermaster's
supplies, and the amount, as the honorable Sec-
retary informs us, could not be obtained " with-
out causing great delay." But by referring to
the parties themselves, or those best acquainted
with the figures, we have, in round numbers, the
following lesults:
Gross amount paid contractors for freight from
the Missouri river to the forts on the plains and
in Utah and New Mexico, as obtained from a
member of the firm of Russell, Majors & Wad-
dell, who were the contractors for 18.38,1859, and
1860: 1858, $4,000,000; 3859, $3,000,000; 1860,
§1,500,000; 1861, not ascertained; 1862, estimate
at least six millions.
The amount for 1858 was larger than in 1859
and 1860 because of the Utah war, some five thou-
sand men being then in the field. The estimate
for 1862 js large bccause of the troops now em-
ployed m New'Mexico being double the number
of those m Utah m 1858.
The foregoing estimates do not include the cost
of conveying troops, tents, quartet master's sup-
plies, &c. These are transported by Government
through its quartermasters, and not by contract-
or, but at an expense nearly, if not quite, equal
the sum paid contractors. Government pays at
the rate of $1 30 pei one liumhed pounds for one
hundred miles, or say, twenty-six cents per ton
per mile, from the Missouri nvei to the points
indicated, two thirds of which could be carried on
a Pacific railroad, on the route contemplated, at
one tenth the present cost.
It may safely be concluded from this exhibit
that the expenditures not embraced 111 the Secre-
tary's statement are quite equal to, if they do not
very much exceed, those contained within it, or
£3,000,000 per annum, making army transporta-
tion to the Pacific and intermediate points cost per
annum $5,809,430 80. So much for army tians-
poi'tation. The postal service may be plaecd at
General Curt is 5s estimate of §1,500,000 per annum.
The following table will show the average cost
of transportation for naval supplies from the east-
ern and Gulf ports of the United States to the
Pacific coast":
Navy Department, March 7, 1862,
Sir: In compliance with the resolution of the House of
Representatives of the 19th ultimo, 1 have the honor to fur-
nish herewith a il statement showing the average cost of
harisportation for naval bupphes, munitions of war, 6te.,
for the last five years from the eastern and Gulf ports of the
United States to the Pacific coast."
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GIDEON WELLES,
lion. G.A. Grow, Speakerof theHouseof Representatives.

From this statement it would appear that such
cost amounts per annum to $48,35J 08; thus mak-
ing in a time of peace, and under ordinary cir-
cumstances, an annual expenditure for Pacific
supplies and postal service of $7,357 81.88.
The bill before us appropriates in bonds, with-
out the Oregon branch, $60,880,000; with the Ore-
gon branch, $64,880,000. The following sched-
ule of appropriations will show the contemplated
expenditure in detail:

If to this is added a branch to Oregon, or say
six hundred miles, at $8,000—$4,800,000—the en-
tire amount of bonds appropriated by this bill will
be $64,880,000. Total number of miles, 2,935.
The amount to several companies 011 mam line
will be as follows:
To the Kansas company, with connections... $7,200,000
To the Ctnual company  31,200,000
To the Nevada company  9,360,000
To Ihe California company  5,920,000
$53,680,000
The bonds are to be issued at thirty years, and
to hear mteiest at the rate of six per cent, per
annum. When all the bonds shall have been
issued (which will necessarily be at the comple-
tion of the road) the aggregate annual interest will
amount to $3,892,080. 1 have shown that the
Aimy and Navy transportation, and postal ser-
vice to th<? Pacific, cost the Government annually
$7,357,781. Take, then, the annual interest froTn
the annual expenditure, and we have left a sinking
fund of $3,465,701, a sum more than sufficient to
extinguish the bonds before they beeome due, or what
is the same thing in effect, saved to the Govern-
ment by cheapening expenditure m that direction, j
We haw, at piesent, no means of ascertaining '
how much the rebellion has added to the cost of
conveying supplies to that part of the country
which could be reached by the railway connection
indicated, but that it has increased the expendi-
ture greatly.no one can doubt. Thanks to the
loyal people of California, Oregon, and Washing-
ton, we have not been called upon to quell rebel-
lion 011 the shoies of the Pacific. Could we have
held the Pacific States against any general rising
of the people 111 the absence of railway facilities?
We might withimmense expenditure; nay, could; .
for I doubt not the power of this Government to
sustain itself against everything, but a railway to ^
the Pacific would have aided us immensely. If j j
England had committed the folly of giving ma- j:
tciuil aid to the rebellion, as she has given moral
aid, our route' by the Isthmus as well as water
transitmighthave beencutoff for a time, and then
the transportation of armies, ordnance, and Army
supplies through the passes of die Rocky mount-
ains and the snows of the Sierras would have been
an undertaking for which history furnishes tio
parallel. We have passed that crisis; how soon
we may reach a second one I cannot tell, but it
will be our folly, nay madness, if we ever incur
the same great responsibility. *
Without detaining the House on the question of
the propriety of a Pacific railroad as a military
want; as a commercial necessity for the require^
ments of internal traffic and foreign commerce;
to secure the trade of the East as well as of the
West; to strengthen our great nation by bringing
us nearer together, and making us more one people;
leaving all this for the present, I will proceed at
once to explain, in practical detail,the bill before
the House, which.I had the honor to report from
the special committee on the Pacific railroad. The
bill was reported with entire unanimity, as gen-
tlemen will observe there has not been any other
measure reported from that committee.
The committee have given the subject intrusted
to them that careful consideration which its im-
portance demanded. Taking the bill reported by
General S. R. Curtis, from the Pacific railroad
committee, in the first session of the Thirty-Sixth
Congress, which was twice agreed upon m com-
mittee, and met with the sanction of this House,
when all the States were represented, and after
full discussion, we have made such changes as
experience has suggested, and which will,in the
view of the committee, greatly improve the bill.
While the bill preserves the middle route, as it
is generally called, repudiating both the southern
and extreme northern routes, it grants more land
and fewer bonds for the construction of the main
line, without the branches; and while itrecognizes
two eastern connections, it authorizes certain ex-
isting railroad companies, who have competent
authority conferred upon them by State legisla-
tion, to construct these branch roads, with the
cooperation of the corporators named in the bill,
to whom and their associates direct corporate
capacity is given.
To be more explicit, the bill contemplates two
eastern branches: one from the western boundary
of Missouri, at Kansas City, on the Missouri river;
the other from a point in Iowa, not further east
than a line drawn due north from Kansas City;
the two branches are to converge and form one .
main line within three hundred miles west from
the Missouri nvcr. These two branches are to be
constructed as follows: the Leavenworth, Paw-
nee, and Western Railroad Company of Kansas
are authorized by the bill to construct the road and
telegraph from Kansas City to the western bound-
ary of Kansas, or to the one hundred and second
meridian of longitnde, (whether within or without
the State of Kansas,) according to the best and
most practicable route. This company has been
organized by the State of Kansas, and is said to
be a subsisting and responsible company. The
same company are also authorized to connect their
Leavenworth branch with the main branch. The
Hannibal and Si. Joseph Railroad Company of
Missouri, a road running from Hannibal, on the
Mississippi river, through the State of Missouri,
to St. Joseph, on the Missouri river, a road com-
pleted and 111 good runningorder; and the Pacific
railroad of Missouri, from St. Louis, by Jefferson
City, to Kansas City, are authorized to connect
with and aid in the construction of the Missouri
branch of the Union Pacific railroad. In short,
the three companies named are empowered, on
equal terms, to construct one of the two eastern
branches of the great work contemplated by the
bill before us.
The other eastern branch starting from " a point
in the State of Iowa, not further east than a line
extending due north from Kansas City," must
unite within a distance of three hundred miles with
the main stem. Fourexisting companies, orany
or either of them, are empoweied to construct this
lowabranch. These companies are the Dubuque
and Sioux City Railroad Company, the Cedar
Rapids and Missouri Railroad, the Mississippi
and Missouri, and the Burlington and Missouri
Railroad Companies, all of them believed to be
valid and existing companies, with roadsprojected
and in some instances in part completed, it will
be observed that the roads mentioned in Iowa and
