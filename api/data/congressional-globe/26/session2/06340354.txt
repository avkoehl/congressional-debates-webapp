country

By this table, we perceive that a duty of 20 per
cent, ad valorem, which will not violate the com-
promise, will bring into the Treasury the sum of
tour million nine hundred arid Ave thousand two
hundred and fotty-six dollars and eigty cents; and
at 15 per cent, the amount will be more than three
and a half million .
A duty on these artic'es, such as I propose, would
not be felt by the country, and certainly would not
be onerous to any part of it
Here, too, is no mention of teas and coffee, now
free of duty I am willing they should remain so.
They are now regarded no longer as luxuries, but
as necessaries But if it becomes necessary, for
purposes oí revenue, to tax them, the following ta
ble will show what will be the result, at the rates
therein mentioned-

The above table shows the amount of duties which would
have accrued under the act of 1832 at rates payable after the
3d of March, 1834
Wine in Bottles —The duties on this class of wmes are
estimated on the contents of the bottles, and exclusive of the
duties on the bottles, which may be estimated at thnty per cent
ad val
Gentlemen tell us this proposition ft tax luxuries
is. a "war against France." Well, sir, let me ask
these gentlemen if France, by taxing our cotton, ib
not warring against us? I see it is stated by very
high authority recently ,11 the Senate [Mr. Clay of
Kentucky,] that our imports, according to ihe last
cornrrercial return, exceeded our exports of our own
native produce to Frarce nearly seventeen millions.
And this, too, while France lays a duty tf twenty-
five per cent, on our cotton' Of course, these se-
venteen millions must be paid in specie, which we
suffer to pais out of the couatry by refusing to tax
the luxuries brought h re Gentlemen would have
us believe that we ought to extend this favor to
France becau«e she was our ally They seem dis-
posed to show especial favor to France to the inju-
ry of our own country I cannot forget the ad-
vice of the Father ef his Country in his Farewell
Address We ought to recur to the principles of
that address oftener We have lost sight of its
precepts in modern times. Hear th  following ad-
vice from Washington's Farewell Address
"Harmony and a liberal intercourse with all nations are re-
commended by policy, humanity, and interest But even our
commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand,
neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences,
consulting the natui al course of things, diffusing and diversify
ing by gentle means the stieams of commerce, but forcing no
thing establishing Willi Powers so disposed, in ordei to give
trade a stable couise, to define the rights of our merchants and
to enable the Government to support them, conventional rules
of intercouise, thebet that present circumstarces and mutual
opinion will permit, but tempoiary, and liable to be, fiom time
to time, aband>ned 01 varied as expenence and circumstances
shall dictate constantly keeping in view that tis folly in one
nation to l«>ok for d sinteiested favors from another, that it
must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it
may accept under that clnratter, that by such acceptance it
may place itself 111 the condition of having given equivalents
for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with mgrati
lude for not giving more
Triers can be nogrettet eiior than to expect or calculate
upon real favots from nation to nation 'tis all illusion which
experience must cure which a just pride oughtto discard
I  stand  by these precept .    The country  will
stand by them.    They will  be íeverenced by all
but those who have lost all regard ft r the memory
of Washington and all attachment for ihe Union
The wholesome advice—
' To thine own «elf be true
And it mustfollow as the night the day
1 hou can'st not then be false to any man,3
is as valuable to nations as to individuals.
I think I have shown, Mr Chairman, beyond all
dispute, that the Treasury will soon need our a*-
si«tance; that it needs replenishing, and that, by
laying duties upon wines, silks, and other luxuries,
aecordirg to the suggestions of the most distin-
guished statesmen of our time, as approved by the
Secretary of the Treasury, we can raise a sufficient
sum 10 answer our purposes without imposmg any
burden upon the people. Why, then, should it
not be done?
Why, sir, we are told it is a viola'ion of the com-
promise, lhat it will fasten a tariff upon the coun-
try, that the object is not merely to raise revenue,
but to distribute tbe funds arising from the sales of
