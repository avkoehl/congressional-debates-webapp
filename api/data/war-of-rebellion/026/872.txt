Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Have sent General Beauregard two of his brigade. If I send more off must have another brigade here.

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, VA., February 7, 1863.

Major General S. G. FRENCH,

Commanding, Goldsborough, N. C.:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Inclosed I send the map of fortifications of New Berne and the description accompanying it, and also inclose memoranda of roads furnished by Colonel Pool and another by two or my staff officers.* Your suggestions in regard to the probability of attack by the James and the possible necessity for a prompt move in this direction are in accordance with my own views of the probable contingencies that must be anticipated. I have long thought that the whole organization of my command ought to be rearranged, and looked to the chances of my being permanently assigned as major-general to command Richmond and this immediate defenses, in which case I hoped to have had Daniel's and Davis' brigades as part of the permanent garrison here as before, and perhaps to have you again at Petersburg; not in my command, but as a neighbor, closely identified with the defense of Richmond, and that our friend, General Pettigrew, if not promoted would be with you. Of course it was taken for granted that active operations in North Carolina would require the presence of a commander of higher and than a division commander, and as I had made up my mind not to serve under any of the lieutenant-generals who were my juniors as major-generals it was tolerably clear to my mind that I would have to retire from that field before the struggle was over. It seems that the Government first intended to send E. K. Smith and then D. H. Hill to command, but something went wrong and * * * to have settled down upon the * * *, excepting I was to remain in the * * * in Goldsborough. I have to-day [determined] to send in my resignation, and thus * * * my plans at least for the present.

To yourself and General Pettigrew and all the officers and men of your command I tender my best wishes. May success and prosperity always attend you. To-day I am not in the mood to write, even if I had time.+

I remain, very truly, your friend,

G. W. SMITH.
