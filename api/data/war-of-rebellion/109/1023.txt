go to the Whitte House or to take the place of the batteries and Carter's battalion as may be most expedient. Unfortunately I have no infantry support that I could send with the batteries. A letter from General Hampton to General Lee corresponding with that sent you, was forwarded to-day to General Lee.

Respectfully,

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

P. S.-Colonel Pemberton will send horses from his batteries to take the guns from Carter's battalion in case Carter's horses are broken down, as I think Colonel Carter has 20-pounder Parrotts, which I have not.

Respectfully,

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

PP. S.-There is one regiment, Sixtieth Alabama, here which might go, but it could not reach in time. Pemberton may take his own guns, orr merely horses to attach to some of Carter's.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

On a visit to the battery at Howlett's to-day I found no engineer officer, and learned that Lieutenant P. W. Johnson had commenced the work with General Beauregard. If he can be spared, it will be well for you to send him back. The firing between the battery and gun-boats was not very effective. One of our guns was dismounted, and the boats were struck occasionally.
