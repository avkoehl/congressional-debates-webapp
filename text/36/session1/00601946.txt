THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 7,
Mr. SHERMAN. I insist on my motion.
Mr. HOUSTON. I propose to amend the mo-
tion of the gentleman from Ohio.
Mr. SHERMAN. My motion is not amend-
able.
Mr. HOUSTON. I understand that it is
amendable. The motion is to close debate on the
tariff' bill.
The SPEAKER. In three hours after its con-
sideration shall have been resumed in committee.
Mr. HOUSTON. I take it for granted that
that is amendable. I move to amend by putting
it at two o'clock on Wednesday.
Mr. H ASKIN. I rise to a privileged question.
The SPEAKER. This is a privileged ques-
tion before the House.
Mr. H ASKIN. But I have a question to sub-
mit which takes precedence of it.
Mr. ELIOT. 1 ask the gentleman to let us
have the States called for half an hour. Unless
the call is had to-day, we may not be able to have
a call at all.
Mr. VALLANP1GHAM. I ask the gentle-
man from Ohio to extend the time for debate till
to-morrow. I desire to speak on this subject, but
I do not think I can do so to-day.
Mr. SHERMAN. In order to_ accommodate
members, and to make a compromise, I will move
that all debate on the tariff bill shall cease at the
moment its consideration is resumed in commit-
tee after to-day. We can have debate upon it all
this day, and to-night, if desired.
i'UBLIC HUNTING.
Mr. H ASKIN. I rise to a privileged question,
which takes precedence of the motion of the gen-
tleman from Ohio.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state
what it is.
Mr. HASK1N. It is this: the matter of the
public printing was made a special order for Wed-
nesday last. In consequence of their being no
quorum present on that day, or on any subse-
quent day, last week, for the transaction of busi-
ness, the matter was not acted on. I now ask
that that special order be continued till Wednes-
day next, after the morning hour.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from New
York has it in his power to call itup at any time.
It is, therefore, not necessary to have it post-
poned.
Mr. HASICIN. 1 presume my proposition will
not be objected to.
There being no objection, it was so ordered.
TAIUI'l' BILL AGAIN.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that all debate on
the tariff bill shall cease at one: o'clock to-morrow.
Mr. HOUSTON. 1 move to amend, by insert-
ing "two o'clock on Wednesday." I had no
idea that the tariff lull would be pressed to a vote
before next week. I intended to discuss it myself,
but am not prepared to do it now. Other gentle-
men want to do so too; and now an attempt is
made, unexpectedly even to the gentleman him-
self, to close debate.
Mr. G ARTRELL called for the yeas and nays
on Mr. Houston's amendment.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the negative—yeas G2, nays 108; as follows:

So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. AVERY stated that Mr. Moore, of Ala-
bama, had paired on the above vote.
The question recurred on the motion of Mr.
Sherman to close debate on the tariff bill at one
o'clock to-morrow.
Mr. HOUSTON. As far as debate is concerned
upon the tariff bill, I would just as soon it should
be gagged through the House in the next twenty-
minutes,as have the gentleman's motion adopted.
I desire to speak upon this myself, and move to
lay the motion on the table.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. Sherman's motion was then agreed to.
ENROLLED BILL.
Mr. THEAKER, from the Committee on En-
rolled Bills, reported that the committee had ex-
amined and found truly enrolled an act (H. R.
No. 3G8) to provide payment for the depredations
committed by the whites upon the Shawnee In-
dians in Kansas Territory; when the Speaksr
signed the same.

A message was received from the Senate, by Mr.
Hickey, their Chief Clerk, notifying the House

ington to make a loan'and issue stock for §200,000

The question then recurred upon the motion of
Mr. Sherman, that the House resolve itself into
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The motion was agreed to.
TIIE TARIFF AGAIN.
The rules were accordingly suspended, and the
House resolved itself into the Committee of the
Whole oil the stale of the Union, (Mr. Wasii-
Buntf, of Wisconsin, in the chair,) and resumed
| the consideration of the bill (H. R. No. 338) to
provide for the paymentof outstanding Treasury
notes, to authorize a loan, to regulate and fix the
duties oil imports, and for other purposes.
The CHAIRMAN stated that the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Grow] was entitled to
the floor.
Mr. SHERMAN. I believe I am entitled to
the floor.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair was under the
impression that the gentleman from Ohio did not
claim the floor.
Mr. GROW. I only desired to occupy some
fifteen or twenty minutes; but if the gentleman
from Ohio is entitled to the floor, I will endeavor
to seek some other opportunity.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman,the revenue
act of March 3,1857, which it is now proposed to
repeal, has proved to be a crude, ill-advised, and
ill-digested measure. It was never acted upon in
detail in either branch of Congress, but was the
result of a committee of conference in the last days
of the session, and was finally passed by a com-
bination of hostile interests and sentiments. __ It
was adopted atatime of inflated prices, when the
Treasury was overflowing with revenue. When
that condition of affairs ceased, itfailed to furnish
ordinary revenue, and by its incidental effects oper-
ated injuriously to nearly every branch ofindustry.
It went into operation on the 1st of July, 1857.
At that time there was in the Treasury of the
United States a balance of §17,710,114. The
amount of the public debt then remaining unpaid
—none of which was then due—was a little over
§29,000,000. So that there was in the Treasury
of the United States when the tariff act of 1857
went into operation nearly enough to have paid
two thirds of the public debt. Within one year
from that time, the public debt was increased to
§44,910,777.
On the 1st of July, 1859, the public debt had
increased to §58,754,699. On the 1st of May,
1860, as nearly as 1 can ascertain, the public
debt had risen to §65,681,099. The balance in
the Treasury on the 1st of July next, as esti-
mated by me, will be §1,919,349. I have before
me an estimate showing the probable condition of
the Treasury on the 1st of July next, as nearly as
can be ascertained. It is as follows:
The Sccietary of the Treasury estimates that the balance in
the Treasury, July 1,1860, will be §14,381,808 40
Subject, however, to the following deduc-
tions:
Loss on the estimated revenue from public
lands $410,244 62
Loss on the estimated revenue
from miscellaneous sources.. 876,275 78
  1,31(5,520 40
And to the following arising from appropri-
ations in acts passed at the present ses-
sion of Congress tor the seivice of the
£ear 1860, and other appropriations in
hills now befoie Congress, and which wiH
become laws before its close, &.c.:
Fulfilling treaty stipulations with Ponca
* Indians  $539,350 00
To supply deficiencies in rev-
enues in the Post Office De-
pat tment for the years 1859
and I860 6,698,000 26
To supply deficiencies in rev-
enues m the Post Ofhee De-
paitmcnt for the year 1860,
turther .*  3,126,324 00
Deficiency bill lor 1860  504,254 76
$13,035,288 00
Deduct other bills containing appropria-
tions, amounts payable within the fiscal
year I860, (estimated) 
10,805,938 02
$2,169,349 98
250,000 00
Thus leaving a balance in the Treasury, 1st
July, I860*, of  ,$1,919,349 98
Thus it is shown that under the operation of
the tariff of 1857, the deficit in the revenue is over
§52,000,000. It may be stated thus:
Balance in the Tieasury, July 1, 1857 $17,710,114
Balance m the Treasury, July 1,1860, estimated, 1,919,349
15,790,665
Amount of public debt, May I, I860, $65,681,199
Amount of public debt, July 1,1857, 29,060,386
 2 !— 36,620,813
$52,411.578
It is impossible to ascertain from the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury the condition of
our finances forthe fiscal year ending June 30,
I860. I have prepared a statement ol receipts and
expenditures, based upon the actual sums received
and paid for three quarters of the year, and the
