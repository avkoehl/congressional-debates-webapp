HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., December 10, 1861.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Our Overland Mail Route cannot be depended on. The late storms of rain and snown have almost entirely stopped the mail by land, and have driven me to the necessity of relying principally on the steamer express. For some weeks past I have received nothing from headquarters. The large packages of orders from your office designed for distribution in this department habitually fail to reach me. The only reliable way is to use the express on the tri-monthly steamers.

Very respectfuly, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding Department.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: The troops in this department are distributed over such a wide extent of country, and the communication with some of the remote stations being very ucertain as to time, we have found it impossible to prepare the tri-monthly reports required at your office with promptness. Under these embaarrassments I avail myself of every opportunity to keep you well informed by letter of the position and condition as well as the proximate strength of the troops on this coast. In Oregon District I have two companies of Ninth Infantry, one company Third Artillery, and ten companeis of volunteer infantry. In the Central District, embracing San Francisco and the northern portion of California, I have three companies Third Artillery, one ordnance company, seven companies Ninth Infantry, one regiment volunteer cavalry, and thirty companies of volunteer infantry. In the District of Southern California I have five companies of volunteer cavalry and a regiment of volunteer infantry. The strength of the four companies Third Artillery is about 350. The strength of the seven companies Ninth Infantry is about 550. The strength of the ordnance at Benicia is about 50. The strength of the First Cavalry (five companies volunteers) is about 450. The strength of the Second Cavalry (twelve companies volunteers) 1,000. The strength of the five regiments infantry volunteers, 3,500. Total 5,900. The condition of the troops is good. They are all under a rigid course of discipline and instruction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
