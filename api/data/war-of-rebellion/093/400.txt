Lawrenceburg road. Henderson's and Casement's brigades were placed north of the village, also on the west side of the turnpike. Wagner's division, of the Fourth Corps, which followed my command and reported to me by order of the major-general commanding, I put in position on the south and southwest of the place, the whole force forming a semicircle, resting upon the turnpike north and south of the village, and all the roads being held by outposts and chains of vedettes. Nothing was seen of the enemy except that on the morning of the 23rd a reconnoitering party of cavalry approached on the Lawrenceburg road and captured two men of Reilly's brigade, who were, without authority, beyond the pickets. The commanding general arrived in person about noon of the 23rd, I received orders to move my division toward Columbia about ten miles, so as to cover the crossing of the Columbia pike by the Mount Pleasant and Shelbyville road. The division was immediately put in motion and reached the point designated at dusk and went into camp. Casement's brigade being in advance was put in position with its right resting upon commanding ground near the junction of the roads, and Henderson's and Reilly's brigades being respectively on the left. Nothing was seen of the enemy, though reports were received that they were in force at Mount Pleasant, nine miles distant, and moving toward Columbia.

November 24, at 4 a.m., received orders to move at once with my division to Columbia, and to cover that place during the concentration of the army there, the enemy being reported to be pushing our cavalry rapidly back on the Mount Pleasant and Columbia pike. The division was immediately put in motion, Reilly's brigade in advance, followed by Henderson's, and Casement's brigade bringing up the rear, covering the train. At a point two miles from Columbia I determined to take a cross-road intersecting the Mount Pleasant pike one mile and a half from the former town, and, marching the head of the column rapidly, reached the last-named turnpike just as the cavalry brigade, commanded by Colonel Capron, reached the same point in hasty retreat before a very superior force of the enemy's cavalry, under Forrest, who had been pressing them hard for several miles. This was at 7 a.m. I ordered Reilly's brigade into position on the right (west) of the turnpike, throwing forward the One hundredth Ohio Volunteers, to the bank of Bigby Creek (a small stream crossing the road at that place, and at the time not easily fordable) to support a strong line of skirmishers and check the enemy's advance during the formation of the division, Henderson's brigade was put in position on the left of the turnpike, in two lines-the first, an advanced line, at Mrs. Wilson's house, on the first plateau above Bigby Creek, and the second on the continuation of a considerable ridge farther in rear and connected with Reilly's line on the right of the road. Casement's brigade, coming up a little later, was placed on the left of Henderson's on the ridge, an excellent position, stretching nearly to the Pulaski pike (see topographical sketch accompanying).* The batteries of the command under, Captain G. J. Cockerill, acting chief of artillery were posed as follows: Cockerill's battery (Battery D, First Ohio Light Artillery) on the right of the Mount Pleasant pike and at the left of Reilly's brigade, Wilber's battery (Twenty-third Indiana Battery) on a knoll between Henderson's and Casement's brigades, and Harvey's battery (the Fifteenth Indiana Battery) at the left of Casement's line. The enemy pushed in vigorously, and a lively skirmish ensued, which continued most of the fore-
