GENERAL HDQRS. DETACHMENT OF NINTH CORPS,
 any River, near Gales' [Gayle's] House, Va.,

FIELD ORDERS May 10, 1864.

The brigadier-general commanding wishes to congratulate the troops on their fine conduct yesterday, the 9th of May, at this place. The Third Division in this action and that of the 6th instant in the Wilderness has begun its career handsomely. The Second Division, for the rapidity and gallantry, with wihich it came up to the fron, deserves great praise. Roemer's veteran battery has again signalized itself. Among the old regiments, where all did gloriously, it would be difficult to signal out the one which distinguished itself most. Of the new regiments the Sixtieth Ohio, which led the attack finely, is entitled to honorable mention. It is to be hoped that one other new regiment will soon regain the good name it won on the 6th instant and came near losing yesterday. The officers and men of this regiment must rally on their pride. The names of officers and men who have particularly distinguished themselves will be hereafter collected from the reports to be made by regimental and brigade commanders.

By command of General Willcox:

W. V. RICHARDS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
