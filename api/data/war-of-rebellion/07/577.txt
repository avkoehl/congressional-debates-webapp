HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 1, 1862.

Brigadier General U. S. GRANT, Commanding, Cairo:

GENERAL: You are authorized to withdraw Colonel Ross' regiment, Seventeenth Illinois, from Cape Girardeau for the Tennessee expedition as soon as they are wanted. The remaining forces are sufficient for that place.

Your requisitions for horses, mules, wagons, &amp;c., cannot be filled immediately. By using steamers on the river, and as the troops will not move far from their supplies and water transportation, much of the usual trains can be dispensed with for several weeks. Don't cumber up the expedition with too large a train. The object is to move rapidly and promptly by steamers, and to reduce the place before any large re-enforcements can arrive.

Very respectfully,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAIRO, February 1, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I will leave here to-morrow night. Force larger than Colonel McPherson supposed could be taken by 3,000.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CAIRO,Cairo, February 1, 1862.

General JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Commanding, Cairo, Ill.:

The troops of your division will be held in readiness to move by steamer to-morrow, taking with them all their camp and garrison equipage, three days' rations and forage, and not to exceed four teams to each regiment. The necessary instructions in this regard have been given those troops not formerly of your command. One regiment of infantry and Dickey's cavalry will be left to garrison Cairo, for want of transportation.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
