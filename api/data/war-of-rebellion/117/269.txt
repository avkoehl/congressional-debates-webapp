Medical officers are also discharge by the insurgents without condition.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 23, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Commanding Army of the Potomac.

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant expressing your desire that permission be given to Mr. Clement Barclay to visit Richmond to obtain information respecting the necessities of your sick and wounded in our hands. I thank Mr. Barclay for his kindness to our sick and wounded prisoners and appreciate his benevolent intentions with reference to his countrymen who are with us. But the arrangements now in process of execution will I hope soon place your sick and wounded where they can more fully enjoy the kind attentions of Mr. Barclay than it would be possible for them to do in Richmond and render his proposed visit unnecessary.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to your desire to forward medical stores and comforts for the use of your sick and wounded in our hands and also for our own. I hope that in a few days your sick and wounded will be under your own where they can enjoy the comforts intended for the, and in the meantime they shall receive such attention as it is in our power to bestow. I thank you for your kind consideration of our own sick and wounded, but we must endeavor to provide for them from such stores as we possess.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,
