Ordered, That Mrs. H. L. G-atcs have leave to
wi thdraw from the files of the Senate the papers in
relation to the claim of the heirs of Colonel William
Gates.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Those papers have been
used in this body and in the other House upon
her claim. They have been adjudicated, and
an act of Congress has been passed to pay
that claim or what was thought a reasonable
and proper allowance, and it has been paid.

papers, which arc in effect the vouchers, ought
not to be withdrawn.

the ease myself.
