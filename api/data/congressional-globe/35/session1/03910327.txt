THE DRED SCOTT DECISION.
Mr. GIDDINGS asked the consent of the
House to submit the following resolution:
Wheieas, the Supreme Couit of the United States in de-
ciding the recent case of Dred Scott against John F. A.
Sand!ord,depaited from the subject befoie them for the ap-
parent puipooe of denying the self-evident truths proclaimed
in the Declaration of American Independence, and exerting
an influence upon this body and the country in favor of sla-
very, it has become the imperative duty of the people to ex-
press, through their authorized representatives, their fiun
and unyielding adherence to the essential doctrines avowed
by the illustrious founders of our Republic: Therefore
Resolved, That the light to live, the liberty to cherish and
protect life, to attain knowledge and happiness, are gifts of
God, conferred equally on every member of the human fam-
ily . That these lights attach tothe human soul; he behind
and above all human enactments; coming fioin the Creator,
they mu.-l ever be held sacred by all OlniMnui Governments,
and their enjoyment can only be invaded by incurring the
Divine di^plea-suie. That, as tyiants, despots, usurpers,
pirates, andoppressms, have in ail ages ot the woiid, sought
to deprive then fellow men of hbei ty, of intelligence, of
happiness, and to hold the lives ot othei persons at their dis-
posal, we fully and unequivocally agree with the eminent
statesmen who foimed our institutions, that the puinexal
object and ulterior design of human government is to secure
every member of the human family 111 the enjoyment of
those rights which God has conferred on him. That said
court, in leprcsonting the signers ot the Declatation of In-
dependence to have asserted truths which they did not
intend to avow, and to have entertained barbarous "doctrines
which they did not express, unjustly assailed the learning,
the intelligence, the patriotism, the Christianity of those dis-
tinguished patriots. That, by disregarding the language of
said Declaration, the debates at the tune of its adoption, the
cuirent histoiy of that period, the oft-repeated views of the
signers of that great charter of human rights, arid seeking
for the intention of those sages m the colonial statutes of
Maryland and Massachusetts, concerning marriage enacted
by olxetire men of a pievious age, the court have biought
diseiedit upon the judiciary of the United States.
Pending the reading of (he resolution,
Mr. HARRIS, of Illinois, said: Mr. Speaker,
can a speech be introduced here in the guise of a
resolution ?
Mr. JBOCOCK. Does the hour rule apply to
the reading of resolutions? [Laughter ]
The SPEAKER. When the hour expires, the
question will arise for the decision of the Chair.
Mr. WARREN. I have an amendment to of-
fer to the resolution.
Mr. LETCHER. I object to the resolution.
NATIONAL ARMORY.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky, introduced a
bill to establish a national armory and arsenal at
the falls of the Ohio river; which was read a first
and second time by its title, and referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs.
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I ask leave
to introduce a joint resolution to amend the Con-
stitution of the United States.
Mr. LETCHER. Let the resolution be read
for information.

ment of the Constitution of the United States is iiereby pro-

lution does not fall by a single objection.
The SPEAKER, '
previous notice it does not
_ Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I have not
given previous notice. I intend the resolution for
reference to the Committee on the Judiciary, in
order that they may consider it-.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ken-
tucky not having previously given one day's no-
tice required by the rules to introduce a bill or
joint resolution, asks the unanimous consent to
waive that requirement.
Mr. HARRIS, of Illinois. I object.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I presume
that a majority of the House can give me leave
to introduce the resolution.
The SPEAKER. A majority could give leave
if previous notice had been given.

olution :

Mr. HARRIS, of Illinois. Can a member,
when his State is not called, tack an amendment
to another proposition? Is it not in violation of
the order >
The SPEAKER. The Chair is of opinion that
the resolution would be amendable, but that the
amendment must be germane to the original prop-
osition; but the Chair is of opinion that the prop-
osition of the gentleman from New York is not
germane to the original proposition submitted by
the gentleman from Kentucky.
The resolution was then adopted.

AUDITING OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTS.
Mr. MASON offered the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Accounts be authorized
to settle, on just and equitable principles, certain accounts
now on file 111 the Cleik's office, for services rendered this
House during the last session, and since the adjournment
of the last Congress; and that the said committee be further
authorized to allow the Clerk of this House to employ such
temporary or permanenjMforce, as, on investigation by said
committee, may be deemed necessary for extra labor grow-
ing out of the icmovalfrom the main building of the Capitol
to the south wing; and to organize properly the clerks, door-
keepers, and post office of the House of Representatives.
Mr. MASON. I merely wish to say that it is
doubtful whether, under the rules of the House,
the Committee on Accounts have the power asked
for in that resolution. There are a good many
obligations growing out of the removal of the
House into this building. A select committee was
appointed some time ago to take into considera-
tion matters connected with this new Hall. That
committee made one report, but have not been
discharged. The duties of the two committees
may conflict somewhat, and I desire that one com-
mittee shall have charge of this whole matter.
The Committee on Accounts are industriously
inquiring into this business.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I would inquire if
those accounts filed in the Clerk's office are the*
ones for extra pay and increased pay and back
pay for the last ten years, voted by the last Con-
gress ?
Mr. MASON. They are not. The House acted
upon those upon their own responsibility. But
there are a great many employes about tne Capi-
tol, some of whom were authorized by the old
Committee on Accounts to go home and stay dur-
ing the recess last summer, and at the same time
draw their pay. There are others here who did
work. We want to do justice between the parties;
to pay those who did work, and to strike off those
who have been illegally authorized to draw pay
, for work which has not been performed. The
committee has beeji investigating all these matters,
and would have reported on them before now,but
the House has appointed two investigating com-
mittees to look into the same business, thus im-
plying that the House has not confidcnce in the
Committee on Accounts.
The SPEAKER. The Chair feels it to be its
duty to arrest this debate.
Mr. HOUSTON. I desire to say a word only.
The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order.
Mr. FLORENCE. I do not desire to object to
the resolution, but I wish to ask a question.
The SPEAKER. It is not in order.
