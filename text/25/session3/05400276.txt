Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Evans.
Ho. of Reps.
I wish this to be clearly understood, because it
shows that Maine is making no new pretensions
—advancing no new claims—disturbing no pre-
viously existing arrangement The possession
and jurisdiction of the Aroostook country has
always been in hei, however it may have been
protested against and claimed by Great Britain
This possession has been more than once acqui-
esced in by Great Britain In 1833, the author-
ities of Maine and Massachusetts opened a i oad
to the Aroostook river, running fifteen miles, or
more, within the teintory, sold timber, sur-
veyed the land for settlement, and did other acts
of a similar character Sir AiclubalU Campbell,
then Lieutenant Governoi of New Eiunswick,
entered his piotest against these piooeedmgs, and
called upon the General Government to cause
them to be stopped. Being assured that it wis
not the intention of the States to extend the road
to the St. Johns, nor to interfere with the Mada-
waska settlement,and as Mr.McLane remaiked
to him, " that no part of the road now constiuct-
vng by that State is believed to be within the ter-
ritory of which the British Government has ever
been  n t/ie actual possession since tlie ¡> taty of 1783,''
the Lieutenant Governor contented himself with
simple remonstrance Why did ho not then as-
sert his jurisdiction over the Aroostook ' Why
not arrest the agents of the States? Why not
stop their surveys and settlements' Plainly be
cause the actual possession of the country had
never been in Gieat Biitain since the tieaty.
Being in us, Sir Aichibald Campbell did not deem
expedient or propei to invade H by foice The
honorable member ftom Pennsylvania does not
keep in view the pieuee localities of the Urntory.
He confounds the possession and jurisdiction
■which Great Britain actually has, north of the
St Johns, in the Madawaska countiy, with that
which she claims south of it, in the Aroostook
region. Maine has complained veiy much, and
I have heretofore complained in her bi halt, that
the British possession of the formei si etion should
have been permitted to continue But, unfoitu-
nately, these complaints have been unheeded
When the honoiable gentleman, therefore, tills
us that we have hitherto acquiesced m the pins
diction of Great Biitain, lint sin has aucsttel
our citizms, which wo hn\e not n sentt d, that
she has broken up the operation of om laws in
iniorporating towns, &r , I reply that all this
occuued in the Madawaska settlements, and fur-
nishes not the smalli st pretense ioi the invasion
of the Aroostook Our possession hue has <vu
been as distinctly admitted practically by them,
as their possession noilhof the St Johns has
been by us As a further proof of this, let me
call the attention of the House to what occuntd
less than two years ago, showing, explicitly, that
no act of sovereignly—not the smallest—on the
part of Gicat Butam, would be tolerated by oui
Government upon this territory.
In 16J5, a company was incorporated by the
Provincial Legislatures of New Brunswick and
Lower Canada, for the purpose ot construí ting a
railroad from St. Andrews to Quebec, and a routo
was surveyed, and plans made, lunnmg directly
acioss the Aioostook countiy, and the teintory
south and west of it, which is now the scene of
military operations These farts having been
made known to our Government, Mr Foisyth,
on the 23d of March, 1837, called the attention
of Mr. Pox to the subject, as one " which, from
its high importance, demands the prompt consid-
eration of his Majesty's Government " After
reciting the circumstances, Mr Porsy th, strongly
protesting against the proceeding, uses phi ases
of thiseoit.
"The ohjeet of the association from its inception was
objectionable ' <' Sull more timwtifiable was the oci« of
sovereignty giving to tins company corpoiate powers over
property known to be claimed by citizens of a friendly and
neighboring State " « The undersigned is directed by the
President to inform Mr Fox that the prosecution of the
enterprise above referred to Will be regarded by this Govern
meat as a deliberate infringement of the rights ot the United
States to the territory in quesiion, and as cm uiwairantahle
assumption of jurisdiction therein by the British Govern-
ment "
And he called for the prompt adoption of such
measures as should put an end to the prosecution
of the measure.
On the 24th of August following, Mr. Fox,
having received the instructions of his Govern-
ment, replied to Mr. Forsyth's letter thus
" I am now enabled to inform you that, m consideration
of the arguments anl obso butioni contained Hi ycur note,
tier Majesty ¡, Government has been pleaded to duect the
colonial aiuhoiitios of Lower Can-id* and IVevv Biunswicii,
respectively, to can e Pll opoiations connected with the
. above mentionod project witlini the lim ts of the disputed
territory to be immediately discontinued "
I     Can anything be plainer than this >   The " ar-
i guments and  observations" which induced the
British Govei nment immediately to discontinue the
I proposed  movements were nothing more than a
I direct and emphatic denial of her right to exer
cise " an act of soieieignty," or undertake "an
unwarrantable assumption of jurisdiction "   An
(issttmpiion o/jttnstitclton is the phiase, plainly ím-
| plyingthatnojunsdictionon herpart had existed
I It will be seen that the act of sovei eignty then com
plained of was one of the lowest foims in which
it could be manifest—the incorporation of a com-
pany by legislative authority, no act done upon
the territory     Yet this was justly regaided as
" unjttsii/ittoie" and not to be permitted,and Great
Biitain promptly yielded to the force of the argu-
ment, and asserted no light of jurisdiction     But
now we are threatened with the veiy highest and
I most rigoious cxeicise of sovereignty known to
i the public I iw—mihtaiy  powt i, sttin, unmiti
gated   authority, the   eword   and   the   bavonet
These aie to come, beaung the ensigns of suv, r
eignty, and the loyal banner is to be unfuiled as
i incontestable proof of the supiemacy of Buiish
I anthouty  there     Shall we  now  submit to  it?
I Shall we tarmly, basely y it Id, and for what'  INot
on the grout d of Agreement, foi our Govei nment
| has now lcputhated thatentirely     On ihe ground
of the original jurisdiction of Great Biitain still
I remaining in hei, because she has nevci se t apart
I and marked off (he territory granted to us by the
I treaty of 17S3?    Is this Congiess piepaiid foi
i one  moment to tolerate  a  si ntimcnt like that3
.Will the gentleman from Pennsylvania, foi  one
instant, give countenance to it*    What, mi, do
wt hold our indtpi nib nte, or any of oui ii„bts,
the smallest of thun, by giant, by conctssion
ftom  Gnat  Biiltun, oi  fiom any other human
powi r'   May the gnu ious gilt be letint ted win n
i\ei it shall pitase tin loyal donors ton aumi  it'
No, sn    we hold om  lights as a nation, til of
them, the lowest as will as the highest, hy the
Missing of God upon our aims—by tin v iloi and
I wisdom of our fatheis—by conquest, by powi i
! conquest which has been a< knowh tlgod and ad
j mittctf, power which has been maintained and
i respected
The idea that the treaty of 1783 was in the na-
' ture of a grant by Great Biitain to us is not new.
| It was started at the treaty of Ghent, or subsc-
I quently in the negotiationsatLondon, upon some
question connected with the fisheries The (lis
tmguished memberfrom Massachusetts, [Mi An
ams,] who is so familiar with the whole subject
and argument, will eonpet me if I am wrong It
Was then insisted that, as the tieaty of 1783 was
a giant of privileges to us, this gietnl was abro
gated by the war of 1812, and that the treaty of
peace of Ghent would not revive the privileges
thus abrogated by the war, but that we could ob-
tain them only by a neto grant and a neio conces
sion, qualified and limited at the pleasure of Great
Britain A principle so utterly subveisive of oui
national character and independence even, was
most successfully met and repelled by the honor-
able membei fiom Massachusetts, [Mr Adams,]
and by the Amei lean Government It was again
met and refuted by Mr Clay, in 1827-28, then
Secretary of State, upon this very question of ju-
risdiction in the disputed territory We are now
to meet the nigument plainly and practically, face
to face Will you yield to it because it is to be
asserted by the edge of the sword ' Will you be
driven fiom the position you have so often taken ?
Will you admit the jurisdiction and sovereignty
over all the disputed territory to be tightfutly in
Great Britain > I hope I have succeeded, to some
extent, in satisfying the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania that, notwithstanding what appears in the
correspondence between the two Governments,
Great Britain will not be able to make out so
plausible a pretense of an agreement as he has
supposed, touching that part of the territory now
more immediately in contiovcrsy     If he still íe-
lics upon my remarks, made under othei cncum-
I stances last year, let me remind him that I was
j then met on this floor, and, in the judgment o*"
some, íefuted, on the veiv point whether the cor-
i respondeiice in fact wauanted any such pretense
The Piesident tssuies us, in his message of the
26th i ltimo, that he has caused to be prepared an
abstiact of all the coitespondence upon the sub-
ject, and he says.
]     ( Ins-teatlof stistauiinrtthe assumptm: of the Hntish fmic
tionaues, that c iriespoiitltnce titsj rotes the  e\i tPnct ol
i any suchagieement "
! Will the honorable member from Pennsylvania
I wait until this abstiact is printed, and then judge
how far his present opinions are well founded '
I But he wants us now to stand up heie in main-
taining the assumptions of the British function-
aries against the express declaration of our own
Government     If the British Government have
I  had plausible pretexts before, they have none
now, they are explictly admonished, and if they
pcrse\tip m attempting military occupation, tin y
do it w ith their eyes open.  Are we to encourago
II  them todo it? Aie we to put oursehes in the
wiong in advance' Arc we to say to hei, go on
if you will, expel Maine if you can, we shall not
intuit le llicre ic much in the diplomacy to jus
tify } oui cotitse , and, il we icsist you, the worhf
will be npt to think wc aro wrong' God foibut
that such s< tinmen's, by implication even, shall
eve i be tUtubutt el to this Congress
¡ As tn tht ide i that the bill undei discussion
commits us to acouisc we arc notalrcady pledged
t> puisue, I confess I was not a little suipnsed to
hear thehonoiablegcntleman fiom Pennsylvania,
while expressing strong disappiobation of the
bill, say he heamly appiovcd of the message of
the Piesident     In my judgment, the measmes
I propost d by the bill arc in stuct accordance with
the nicbsige      What says the Piesident?

puativeon him to furnish He is to judge of the
e mc igency lie h is pidged, and the bill simply
provides that when lint tmeigency arrives, he
shall have the means of performing his high con-
stitutional duties The Piesident is pledged in
the face of the countiy and of all mankind The
nation is already committed If the bill be a war
bill, wai is aliendy commenced If it be oflen
sive and hostile, it is too late to recede Otu
ground is taken—plainly, distinctly, and openly
1 submit to the honorable gentleman from Penn-
sylvania whether he wishes to hold foi th to the
British Government a divided sentiment in our
Government on the great piopositions involved
in this controversy ' While one department has
boldly and manfully taken its position in resist-
ance of the extraoidinary and fatal principles
which lie at the bottom of their assumptions,
another bianch—and that the popular hianeh—
is willing to concede away the very foundation
on which our independence stands—to concede
that our rights, our national rights, rest upon
gieinf, upon concession^ Has he well consideied
to what results such admissions, however faintly
made, will lead? We have stiong proof in the
debates of this day of the importance of every
word uttered upon this floor bearing upon our
foreign relations Did tho honorable gentleman
[Mr Biddle] listen, did the House attend, to the
document pi oduced by my honorable fuend from
Maryland, [Mr Kennedy'] And did they ap-
preciate the effect which every word we utter m
this Hall 13 calculated to have upon the British
Cabinet and British counsels' In the apprehen-
sion that sufficient attention was not bestowed
upon it, allow me, sir, at the hazard of repetition,
to advert to it again.
You will well recollect, Mr Chairman, that in
1835 a resolution was moved by yourself, [Mr.
Lincolk, of Massachusetts,] calling upon the
