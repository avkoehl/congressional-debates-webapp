Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Dick Taylor has surrendered to me with the forces under his command, and the terms of agreement have just been signed. Can the Missouri and Kentucky soldiers be permitted to return to their homes? If they are obliged to remain here it will cause much embarrassment to us as well as to the people in this region.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Lieutenant-General Taylor has this day surrendered to me with the forces under his command on substantially the same terms as those accepted by General Lee. There are no Confederate troops immediately south of Tennessee River, in consequence of the scarcity of supplies in that region, and I recommend that for the present no troops be sent there, except to garrison Corinth and Tuscumbia, which are the present termini of the Mobile and Ohio and the Memphis and Charleston Railroads. I request to-day the commanding officer at Memphis to prepare to garrison Grenada, Miss., as soon as General Taylor apprises him that the present garrison is ready to be relieved. Be pleased to establish telegraphic communication with Corinth as soon as possible.
