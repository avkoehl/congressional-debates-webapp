Skirmishing kept up for one hour, when the last charge was made by the enemy on our left and center; repulsed at 12 and driven to the bluff. Forces withdrawn at 12.30.

LITTLE ROCK, May 6, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff:

The latest information from Kirby Smith and Price locates them on the Saline, near Jenkins' Ferry. You will therefore remain with your force at Pine Bluff until their intentions as to an attack on our lines are made known. All veterans in the department will be sent on furlough in a very short time.

By order of Major General F. Steele:

W. D. GREEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., May 6, 1864.

Major W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I again feel compelled to apply to General Steele for re-enforcements of white troops. The evidence I have of the hostility of the entire people of this place and the adjoining counties, as communicated. The exceptions are few. I have positive information that there is a cavalry force this side of White River numbering at least 1,200, and that if they do not attack this place they will raid upon the leased plantations, where there are large stores of provisions, 500 mules, and 3,000 negroes. I have had sent me three companies of the --- negro troops. I have had two forts, each with a strong block-house, built to protect them. They are 3 1/2 and 13 miles below this place. They have inexperienced and incompetent officers. If attacked by infuriated free-negro haters what are they to expect? If I withdraw them, what will become of the leased plantations for the protection of which they were sent here?

This place has six forts and a picket-line 4 miles long, which cannot be lessened. The forts are manned by colored infantry troops. How well can if be expected they will handle artillery, the two Government whart-boats, and quartermaster's and commissary stores of great value?

To defend the post I have-

35th Missouri Infantry, for duty............................ 256

Seven companies 15th Illinois Cavalry, for duty............. 279

Four companies 6th Tennessee Cavalry, for duty, dismounted.. 177

Captain Ford's company, 4th Arkansas Cavalry................ 50
