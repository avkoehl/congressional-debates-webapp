years from this date, (for that is about the time
it would take to build and establish a line,) or
for two years, or for one year—I am not par-
ticular as to the time—you may go where you
please and buy your ships for that length of
time, and no longer, to be engaged in the for-
eign traffic; but they shall never be national-
ized so as to interfere with our domestic traffic.
That is a monopoly that belongs to us that
must never be interfered with.
But then the ship-build ers will bi tterly oppose
such a proposition. It is no hardship to the
ship-builders, for they do not build one single
ship now and they never htvve built a single
s*hip to compete in this traffic. Nor is it any
hardship to the present vessel-owners. They
do not carry an emigrant; they do not carry a
pound of valuable freight. They are driven
from the trade ; and it is no hardship to them
if you allow them and others for three years
to come in and compete for this most profitable
traffic. Nor is it any particular benefit to (he
Clyde shij)-builders, for they to-day build every
ship that is engaged in your commerce; and
they will continue to build them so long as they
can build them cheaper than wo can; and it
does not make one single iota of difference to
them whether they sell them to an American,
a German, a Frenchman, or a Briton.
Now, sir, the question resolves itself into
this: which is the most for the interest of
American commerce? A fair profit on the
building of a ship is said to be from ten to
fifteen per cent.. That would be from forty to
sixty thousand dollars on the building of a
three-thousand ton ship. But the ship earns
twenty-five per cent, a year for twenty-one
years, wowillsay. They would not do it ordin-
arily; but those Gorman linos, as 1 have shown
■you, did it last year. Now, is it most for the
interest of the commerce of the Uuited States
to permit, for a limited period, the purchase
of a few steamships that can and will compete
for this traffic, or shall we abandon the traffic
altogether? Sonic say we can do it by subsi-
dies. Very well; if von will pay sufficient subsi-
dies you can do it. But I question very much
whether any subsidies that this Congress would
over agree to offer would be deemed sufficient
to induce our merchants owning shipping to
go into the business. But lot them try. It is
a trade that must be learned. Allow them
these drawbacks until they have experimented
and brought themselves up to the point of
buildjng ships that will compete for this trade.
We Ucat the world in wooden ships. We can,
after a time, beat the world in iron ships. We
cannot do it to-day. In the mean time the
world is reaping a harvest from this commerce
too great almost for computation.
But, Mr. President, there is one other way
in which we might increase our commerce—
one that is simple—and that is by enlarging it.
If we see fit to enlarge our own domestic eom-
rneree we shall increase it. Wo must enlarge
it by enlarging our borders. Take in the islands
of the Gulf; take in the Sandwich Islands; in
process of time take in the Dominion of Can-
ada; take in Columbia; and you will enlarge
your commerce immeasurably. But, sir, one
thing at a time. An opportunity is now offered
you by a simple vote of enlarging your com-
merce, and enlarging it tremendously. San
Domingo stands rapping at the door for admis-
sion. Why should we not take San Domingo
in? Does any man here comprehend the vast
importance that the traffic with San Domingo
would be? Why, sir, in 178'J the commerce
ol San Domingo was immensely greater than
the commerce of Cuba ait the present day.
Mr. SUMNER. The whole island.
Mr. CHANDLER. Yes, sir; the whole
island. I read an extract from Alison's His-
tory of Europe, volume six, pages 99,100, 101,
and 137:
"San Domingo, the largest with the exception of
Cuba, and beyond all question, before the revolu-
tion, the most flourishing of the West India islands,
is about a hundred marine leagues or three hundred
Knglish miles in length, and its mean broadth is about
thirty leagues or ninety miles. It contains throe
thousand square leagues, of which two thirds were
in 1789 in the hands of the Spanish, and one third in
those of the French."   i *   xhe
produce of the island .and the commerce which it
maintained with themother country before the com-
mencement of the troubles were immense. The
French part alone raised a greater quantity of colo-
nial produeethantho whole British Westlndiaislands
taken together. Its exports in 1798 amounted to the
enormous value of 189,000,000 francs, or £7,560,000,
(about $88,000,000,) and the gross produce, including
the Spanish portion, reached 460,000,000 francs, or
£1S,400,000, (about $92,000,000,)while its imports in
manufactures of tho parent State, were no less than
250,0f)0,000 francs, or £10,009,000 sterling, (about
$50,000,000.) More than half of this immense pro-
duce was reexported from Franco to othor States,
and tho commorco thonco arising was tho chief
support of its maritime power. Sixteen hundred
vessels "—
Mark you right here, Mr. President, we are
at work now in tho interest of commerce; wo
are trying to restore commerce; and Alison
says—
"Sixteen hundred vossels and twenty-seven thou-
sand sailors wore employed in conducting all the
branches of this vast colonial traffic."
That was in 1789; and to-day the island of
Sail Domingo is more prolific than it was then.
With tho new modes of cultivation, with tho
new processes of manufacture, under the Amer-
ican flag, with freedom, we should within five
years have a greater commerce from San Do-
mingo than sho overproduced before. In 178'J
it required sixteen hundred vessels and twent.y-
seveu thousand sailors to do that traffic.
" Sixteen hundred vessels and twenty-seven thou-
sand sailors wore omployed in conducting all the
branchos ol this vast colonial traffic. Tho inhabit-
ants of tho French portion consisted of twenty-fivo
thousand Europeans, an equal number of free mul at-
toes, and four hundred thousand nogro slaves. Tho
soil of tho island wa-i oqually suitable in tho plains
for tho cultivation of sugar, indigo, and cotton, and
in tho mountains for that of coffoo and cocoa. Tho
value of its produce was not less than £30,000,000,
(about S150,000,000,) at tho present vuluu of money, of
which at loast a half bolonged to France. With so
magnilioont a settlement, Franco had no occasion to
envy thodopendoneiesof allother States puttogether.
It was this splendid and unequaled colonial posses-
sion which tho Fronch nation threw away and de-
stroyed at tho commcncomont oftho revolution, with
a recklessness and imyrovidonco of which the pre-
vious history of the world had afforded no oxample."
Alison wrote this history some time ago. Had
ho waited till this day he would have seen a
folly that exceeded that of France, in case this
Government should reject the island. Alison
will have to correct his history, unless that
treaty is ratified and the island of San Do-
mingo admitted into the Union. Why, sir,
look at the map. The island of Sail Domingo
is several hundred miles nearer by water to
New York than New Orleans. It is directly
south of New York, and it flanks the whole
of tho West India islands. It is a little out
of our way in going to New Orleans, but it is
several hundred miles nearer by water to the
city of New York than New Orleans. Sir,
owning the island of San Domingo, Cuba as
absolutely and inevitably falls as the leaves
fall in December. Cuba in aa inconceivably
short space of time will follow San Domingo.
My friend from Massachusetts must remem-
ber that when, in 1858, the Democratic party
offered a proposition in this Chamber to pay
$200,000,000 for Cuba, every Democrat on
this floor was in favor of it.
Mr. SUMNER. That was in the interest
of slavery.
Mr. CHANDLER. Says my friend that
was in the interest of slavery; and so it was.
It was as a bulwark to slavery. This is in
tho interest of freedom. That is the difference
between the two propositions. They would
pay $200,000,000 for the island of Cuba in the
interest of slavery. We will not accept a better
island in the interest of freedom.
Mr. SUMNER. All are free in San Domingo.
Mr. CHANDLER. Exactly so; and let us
raise the American flag there, and they will all
be free in Cuba in less than five years. Sir,
the possession of that island flanks all the West
India islands, andgives us the key to the Gulf;
and once possessing the key to the Gulf, we
make all the world tributary to us; we control
the products of the tropics; we control the
sugar and coffee of the world, and make all
the world tributary to us.
But let me continue this extract.

But again, in the Book of the World, by
Richard S. Fisher, published by Colton, of New
York, in 1849, I find the following:
" Thclfertility of those regions is unsurpassed, and
tho soil is capable with little trouble or cultivation
of producing more sugar and other valuable com-
modities than all the British islands together. Tho
inhabitants, however, are not industrious." * ■'
* * " Tho country is well watered. Tho river
Yuma flows through tho valley of Vega Ileal for
upward of seventy miles, and falls into the bay of
Samana. This river is navigable for thirteen leagues
fromitsmouth." - *   + "TheDomin-
ioan territory comprehends two thirds of the island.
Tho country is lertilo in tho productions of tho West
Indies, and in copper, gold, iron, and coal. The
pearl fisheries arc carried on in the great bays. Tho
principal ports aro St. Domingo, Puerta do Plata,
Ar.ua, Samana, and Monte Christi." r «• * i
" Tho principal articles of export aro mahogany,
lignum-vitoe, logwood, tobacco, (in leaf,) and cigars,
cattle, hides, yellow and whito wax, gum guiacuin,
lionoy, andlumber." * * * * "Tbepop-
ulation is over two hundred thousand, of which half
aro whites, who hold the general administration, and
two thirds of the othet,half are mulattoes, a great
portion of whom aro landed proprietors. Slavery
has bccnforevorabolishedintherepublic. Govern-
ment is similar in form to tho United States. Presi-
dent, senate, and houso of representatives and judi-
ciary, with the usual powers conccdcd to the severnl
departments."   * * * "There is no
late statistical information relative to these govern-
ments, in fact none since tho soparatio-n. The com-
mcrco belonging to this island ascertained from tho
returns of 1836 shows tho following results: three
hundred and sixty-nine ships of 50,580 tons bunion,
with cargoes worth £474,782, or $2,278,951, entered;
and three hundred and ninety-five ships of 52.483
tons, with cargoes valued at £921,336. or $4,442,412,
cleared out: thus leaving a balance in favor of the
island of £44'6,554, or $2,163,456."
Johnson, in his Gazetteer, published in Lon-
don in 1850, speaking of the whole island of
San Douiingo, says:
"Tho soil is highly fertile, and a great part of tho
island is eovorcd by donso forests of mahogany,
iron-wood, logwood, cedar, and othor valuablo tim-
ber trees. Products comprise tho plantain, vanilla,
and manioc, besides ordinary colonial resources; but
cultivation and wealth had so much declined that
m 1820 tho export of sugar amounted to only 32,864
pounds, that of coffoo to 32,190,000 pounds, and that
of cotton to 020,972 pounds, the two latter amounts
being respectively only about two fifths and ono
tenth of tiie exports in 17S9, when tho island was a
French colonial possession and at the height of its
prosperity." {.That would make cofFeo about 77,-
000,000 pounds and cotton about 7,000,000 pounds in
1/Sy.J " In 1830 37,6(52,674 pounds of cofi'eo, 6,767,902
pounds of logwood. 4,854,944 foot of mahogany,
1,222,710 pounds of tobacoo. besides cotton, cocoa,
cigars, sugar, rags, wax, and ginger formed tho chief
exports. In 1830 the imports at tho principal port
were worth £474,782, or S2.373.910, and tho exports
worth £921,336, or $4,606,680," [showing for 1836 the
excess of exports over imports at tho one principal
ports of $2,232,770.J
Johnson also says that—
" From 1663 to 1790 the island was by far the most
flourishing of all the Indian colonies."
McCulloch, in his Commercial Dictionary,
says:
Thcro has been an extraordinary dccline in tho
fiuantity and value of thearticles exported from the
island of San Domingo sincc 1789. Sugar, for ex-
ample, has fallen off from 141,000,000 pounds to almost
nothing; cofi'eo from about 77,000,000 pounds to a
little more than 32,000,000 pounds in 1S28; cotton
from <,000,000poundsto620,000poundsin 1826; indigo
from 758,000 pounds to nothing, <fce. Mahogany j*
almost the only article the exports of which have
rapidly increased of late years."
San Domingo used formerly to bo one of th<>
greatest sources of coffee supply,having exported in
1786 about 78,400,000pounds, and it is supposed tli  r
