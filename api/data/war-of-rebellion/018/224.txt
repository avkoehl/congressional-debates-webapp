Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Thanks for copies of General Banks' dispatches. The force described by the general is Ewell's division, consisting of ten regiments, commanded by Brigadier-General Taylor, Elzey, and Trimble; Green's and Munford's regiments of cavalry; three batteries, of four pieces each; making an aggregate of over 7,500 men. General Jackson is reported to have 7,000 men on the west side of the Shenandoah. I deem this information reliable. From a refugee I learn that a large number of troops are being sent into Albemarle County to sustain this movement of Ewell and Jackson. I still have rumors of a large force south of me. Yesterday I had scouts within 3 miles of Flint Hill, who report troops at that place. A portion of this information may be useful to General Banks. The enemy is in possession of at least 10 miles of this road. I have scouts out in all directions, and the enemy's pickets are visible on the northwest and south. I will keep you advised.

JNO. W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

RECTORTOWN, May 24, 1862.

(Received 3.20 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Finding that bodies of the enemy are moving north of me and others in the south, to cut me off on the flanking road, I have ordered my command back to White Plains, a distance of 10 miles-only practicable method of preventing them and securing a position I shall be enabled to hold.

JNO. W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Brigadier-General Wadsworth.)

WAR DEPARTMENT,

May 24, 1862-8.40 p. m.

General GEARY, White Plains:

The reports from Banks show that he has probably secured himself by falling back upon Winchester. Re-enforcements have been sent forward. Fremont and McDowell are also under orders to operate against the enemy. McDowell will move toward Catlett's and will support you, so that there will ben occasion for you to fall back any father, and you should hold your line, if possible, until he comes up.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
