I have received your message by Major Meade and note by Rosencrantz. Miles is already moving out to attack on Warren's right. I have ordered the attack to be extended completely over my lines.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-1.45 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Dispatch by Stacey sent to Miles for his government. At same time Miles sent me word he thought he could take the enemy's works if his right was supported by a brigade en potence. I have ordered him to do it. Have ordered De Trobriand out to support Miles' right. Have notified Mott that he may be obliged to move another of his brigades to the left. He has one in reserve, one in his line. Hays I ordered some time ago to draw out a brigade and hold it in reserve in his center. Mott can call on him. He on Miles, if heavily attacked.
