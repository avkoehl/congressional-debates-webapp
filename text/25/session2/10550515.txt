Son that is early as the yeat 1800 the Noith western territory
íwhich then comprised a!¡ ¡hat section of countiy northwest of
the rivei Ohio, east of the Mississippi and w est of the States of
Pennsylvania and N«w "Voik, to our northern boundary} was
divided m o two separate Teiri Oiies The ne*dy constitu ed
Territory carved out oí the then 2sorthwestern Territory was,
as is welt kn >wn called the! erriiory of Indiana (Land Laws,
p 451, sec 1) lhis Ten [tonal Government of Indiana was
to go mto operation, says the act cor -Hunting that Xemtory,
so soon as ' satisfactory ewdenee should ba given to the Go

years The Northwe^ern Ten toiy stiil continued under a
Territorial Govunn ertur il itwasciecedintoa State in io03,
three years after the division h«d taken p ace (Land Laws, p
474 ) The Indi ma Terntoiy was divided, and tbeTein ory of
Michigan formed tbeiLtrom in 1$0j And in LoOQ Indiana was
again divided, and tne ^epiiate T( mtory of Illinois  constituted,
while Indiana herself wis no admitted into ihe Umun on an
equal footing with tne other butes u til December 1816, there
being thus two lemtorial Gov>rrments contiguous to each
other foi foui years and thiee of those Governments, under the
guardianship of the Geaer-r Government-, 11 the same relation
to each other foi the urm of'wvenyeais (LandLaw«,PP 514
and 718) Mr S also «nil it was well known that Wisconsin
enjoyed the benei1 of a separate Teimortal Government lor
soma time befoie the S aia ol Michigan was admitted mto the
Union and the delegate from Wisconsin bad his seat hete while
Michigan was still a Tenitoiy This much he had thoughtpio
per to observe mieply to the ahefcauonso frequently made yes
terday. that it had not been usual t > cdnstuu e separate Teni
tonal Governments contiguous to each other 11 the *ame sec
tion of countiy, and that few n stances bad occurred, it had
been said, of d vuhng a Ten.it >ry except io the purpose of
forming and admitting a Sta e mio tie Lnion Ihe reverse he
found to be tiue As far as theauthonty of piecedents could
go to establish the propiiety of the course sought to be pursued
by the Government in the proposed measiue he thought it suf
ficiently ample Ihe acti n oi the General Government in like
cases had been urn oi in W enevei it h td apj tared to be ne
cessary for tht, 1 appmp s welfare andem vemence of any por

Surely, said Ml *■  agooleabe had been mide out in the
present instance The feiiit ry oi Wisconsin embraced one
of the most extensive, rich and feitile sections of country
within the limits oí the United %tate«, with a population of
more than fifty thousand souls It was something like a thou
sand miles in length fiom east to west, and eight hundred m
width, comprehending an aie i equal m extent to that of some
three or four of the largest estates in the Union Two thirds of
its inhabitants-and the greater portion of its temtory lay west
of the Mississippi whith wasto be theboundary w enthepro
Íiosed division should take place between the new Teintorv of
owa and Wisconsin Thid nvei and t ie grea distance to be
travelled over in traversing nib country, lormeda very con
siderable barnei to the interco rise ol the citizens and par ícu
larly to their associat o i together under one local Government
Much greater were the^e embauassrnen s to the citizens of
Wisconsin than those of a similar kind which had been en
countered m any of the instances he had cued And tire popu
latum which was embraced m the proposed Tmitory was more
than tuple in numbers to hat required m the fo mation ofother
Territorial Governments torhis pirt he d d not see how tha
protection asked for could be wit held without, doing manifest
injustice to a very considerable and nientonoub portion of our
fellow citizens The chief boast of our Government was, he
said, that it meted out even handed justice to all As to the
objection that it would lea í t the more spee iy ei ection of a new
State, he did not co^siuer that now pioperly open to discus ion,
at least if it be appl ei to the f ima ion of a State east
of the Mississippi Th a bill, liowe/e di 1 not propose to
change the government in ary pait of the Wisconsin Ter
ritory, or to provide any firm lor its luture government
after it shall cease to be under a Terntori\l Government it
merely gave additional facilities and conveniences to her cit
zens under the foim of Government that now exists there
Every question which is now open will still be open, notwith
standing this bill shall become a law He conceived the ques
tion as to the erection of a State east oí the Mississippi out of
that part of thi* Territoiy which was orce ncluded in the
Northwestern Territory, assettled and indeed, notopen for con
troversy By the c^ion act of Virginia, it vas conditioned ex
pressly that the temtory so elel, of which this is a part,
should be laid out and lOinW into Sta es containing a suitable
extent of territory, not le«>% tl an one hi adied nr r more than one
hundred and fifty miles square oi as neat tnereto as circum
stances would admit, and that the átate* so formed should be
distinct Republican S ate?, &c (Land Laws p 98 ) On the
30th December 1788 the Legislature of Virginia on the recom
mendation of Congress, ievi«ed then act of cession so far as to
empower Congie stomal e such a division of the saidTemtoiy
into distinct and Republican btateb, not more than five nor le^s
than three in number as the situation of the country and future
circumstances might "equire, and, at the same time, recognising
and confirming as i ir as their actcould qo so the ordinance of
Congress of the 13 h Jjtly 1787, for the government of theTer
ritory northwest of the river Ohio (Land Laws, p 101) It
was also stipulated in the ordinance of Congiess and the act of
Virginia above cued, that whenevei any of the States (to be
formed out of the Northwestern Terntory) should have sixty
thousand free inhabitants tnerein, *uch State should be admit
ted by its delegates into the Congress of thp United States on
an equal footing with the original States m all respects what
ever, and should be at libeity to lorm. a permanent constitution
and State Government    (Land Laws p 101 )
These stipulated regulations, he believed, had so far been ad
hered to Four States had already been formed out of that Ter
ritoryjand there was yet remaining a quantity of territory suf
fieientfor-another-State.   It would be time, enough to consider
the obligations that Congre <* may be under to admit a new
State m that ouait emu   tl e I a on   when its inhabitants «hall

In-suppoitM thisschene r r air aagm  nation of n" aimv

which in nyjulgmen , aie utterly íepagiant to the very natJie
oí our political system The gurtlem i from N^w \ork, [Mr
Brosson,] in hi lemaiks onyester1?y ertirely discredited the

Trora these documes in regard to thr mihtia  sai i Mi   Vv
I  ocg leave to dissent r r hcally an 1 ioj ougnlv I deny that the
milma aie liable to the ob c io js whicn ha\ e b°en u.ged and,
m the ne^ít pace, if the objecti ms are well iounled, it is
not the piop i way to remove them by an increase of the regu

any thing to disci edit he militia orti stifeised*1 their service

JNow, sir, weie these tí e doctimes and opinions av)weiby
the founders of the R publican creed n former penods of our   !
history1   Mostassiuedly not    On tie connaty   the opinions
and precepts of that political school, to which some gentle nen   !
now profess especially to beiong   aie directly the leverse ol   i
what we have heard on the present occasion    Let me lead io
the committee (mid Air  Vv ] the sentiments of Mi   Jefierson
on this sutject, they ought to be commended pamculaily to
the attention of gentlemen who now claim to bs his exclusive
disciples
In the inaugural address delivered by Mr Jefferson on the
4th oi March 1801, 1 e called the attention of the America)
people to certain leading objects w which the polity of hi&
Administration would bed-rected Among these, he stated that,
'A well diseiomied militia was our best íehance in peate,
and for the fir*t moments of war, till regulars may relieve
them, the supremacy oí the civil over the military ati*hoxtty,"
&c
On the 8th of December following, m the first annual mes-
sage to Congress he says
*i«* A statement has been formed by the Secretary of War, on
maluie considerar on, oí all the posts and stations where gar
r sons will be expedient, and of the number of men requisite
for each garrison The whole amount is consideiably short of
the piesent military establishment Tor the suiplus no parti
eular use can be pouted out For defence against invasion
then number is as nothing nor is it com eived needful xn safe
thata s andingatmy should be kept np in time of peace for
that puipo^" Urcertain as we must ever be of the particular
point m o u ncumierence whore an enemy may choo&e to m
vade us, 11 only fnrce whichcan be ready at every point, and
compett t i -) oppose them, is the body of neighboring citizens,

most romement m njmbers proportioned to the invading
foice i* best to rely, not only to meet the first attack, but, if
it thr e s to be permanent, to maintain the defence until re
gulai   nay be engaged to relieve them "
Su t Mr Chan man weie the sentiments entertained by
that i dyofmen known formerly as the Republican party
To t espec al attention, ttieiefore¡ of the gentleman from New
Yoi and those associated with him I would commend these
doc ime«oi Mr Juffer^on as being eminently useful at this
ti"-u ¡orthey will in 1 cate, as 1 think mostclearly the course
w leh ought to b-. pm^ued by the House in regard to the pro
p sit on now uefoie u« If we yie d as we should do, to the
i ifiuence of the piinc pies which formerly governed the coun
iiy, we must vo t. igam-t a 1 project for mcreasng the regu
at aiiny, unless it is absolutely ai d ir 'hspen^ahly necessary to
do so
Now what, lei me ask, said M> Williams is the necessity
for thioinoieasc oftheariiy? Are we not in profound peace
with all the wo'-ld oi at 'eajf, with all thecivihzeu world? No
thing appears to the contra i y We are not advi^d by the Ex
ecutive tiidt any dáng^i exists of a collision with the Govern
meat of Great Britain on the Can tda frontier, or the frontier of
the S-ate of Maine All pom & re pectmg the boundarv ques
tion are to be the "Ubject offutuieand further negotiation be
t veen the two Governments A hspo-^ition is thus manifested,
by both pames to tieaf peaceably Or. the «ettlemen of these
matters rather t nan go to wai
On t* t Canada frontier there is no more danger of collision
t tan there isoi theNoithpa-,tprn border Theie may occasion
ally be so ne unlawful and viy'ent movements of individuals m
that quai et but none to mvoH the two Governments In
lucd "aid "ir W ma) be stated as a "i incontrovertible truth
that no two nation" ever wen to war foi the licentious and un
lawful conduct of then cinzen^ or ° bjects towards each other,

hand, England has no disposition to so to war with the United
States Her commercial merest is greatly promoted by trad

were othei motives which would le&tram her She aught to

But the gentleman fiom New \ ork has told us that the peo-
ple of the Urn °d States on the borders of Canada are disaffect

Itwasd ncultft him to believe said Mr Vv that such evils
exis^d to the exten stated by the gentleman fiom New York
Hiuouldn bel eve that our citizens were thus u^loyal and
