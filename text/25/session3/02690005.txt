APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Report of the Secretary of the Navy.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
article of the treaty with the Choctaws of 1830,
had made considerable progress, when their ap-
pointments were terminated by the expiration of
the law on the first of August last. The final
adjustment of these claims is important to the in-
habitants of the State of Mississippi, and to the
Indians who remain among them, to the former
as a measure essential to the settlement of land
titles, and to the latter as conducive to their re-
moval and union with their countrymen, who are
making rapid advances in wealth and improve-
ment It is, therefore, respectfully recommended
that the commission be renewed at an eaily day.
The stipulations in the treaty with the Chicha-
saws, which were to be executed east of the Mis-
sissippi, have been nearly fulfilled About two
hundred íeserves are yet to be located, and of
those located, about two hundred to be sold It
is estimated that the proceeds of future sales
will be sufficient to pay their debts, and to defray
the expense of their removal and subsistence
They will then have a national fund of $2,000,000,
yielding them an annual income of one $100,000,
r sum adequate to all their possible wants
Of the emigrated tribes, all the accounts that
have been received are encouraging The re-
cently emigrated Creeks have formed agricultural
and trading establishments, and found in the com-
fort around the , and tne prospect of individual
wealth before them, the strongest inducement to
cultivate friendly relations with their brethren,
with other tribes, and with the United States
The council convened by the Cherolcees had no
object unfriendly to our people or Government
This belief originated from a misappiehension of
the condition °nd temper of those Indians It is
not probable that those who emigiated many yeais
since, and from whom the call of the council pro-
ceeded, would jeopard then whole property, the
farms, the stock, and merchandise they possess,
and the ¡aige annuities they receive from the Uni
ied States, for the gratification of commencing a
war which they could not be ignorant must term-
inate in their utter destruction It appeals from
subsequent information that the Cherokees hold
an attriuat council for the purpose of legislation,
end that, in order to revive an ancient association
of the tribes, foimed for the preservation of peace
among themselves, they invited, m 1837, the
Greeks, Sénecas, and others, to meet them, and
in 1838 renewed their invitations, and extended
them to more distant nations They applied, in
some instances, to the United States officers to
write letters of mutation, and their request was
complied with, and wheie the wampum was sent,
that symbol contained no red beads or other
war-like tokens Notwithstanding, however, the
peaceful appearances which characterized these
preliminanes, some of the more northern tribes
suspected the object of the council to be hostile to
the whites, and refused to attend, the same opin-
ion might naturally have been entertained by tne
officers of Government at distant posts, but it
would have been imprudent to have acted unon
such suspicions To pieserve our influence over
the Indians we must aobtain from all unnecessary
.nterferenee in their local affurs To disturb their
councils, or to attempt to overawe their pioceed-
.ngs by an armed foice, might excite unfriendly
feelings, and tend to produce the very evil the
Government is so anxious to avoid Noi could
such an interposition have led to the discovery of
the designs of the council If the views of tnat
body had been hostile, and the occasion of the
representatives of so many tubes being assembled
had been deemed a fitting one to consult on wai-
hke measures, those consultations would have
been secret, and the presence of our troops would
have only led them to conceal then design still
more deeply
Since this event the Department has again been
called «pon by the commanding general of the
western division of the army to furnish additional
troops to guard the southwestern fiontier from
apprehended attacks from the Indians inhabiting
Texas, encumstances having led to the belief
that these Indians had been excited by the Mex-
ican authorities to attack the Texans This call
increased the vigilance of the Department, and in-
quiries weie instituted which did not elicit any
information that would have justified me m recom-
mending such a draft of militia as was proposed
to aid the regular force on that frontier The
Indians within the territory of the United States
have been warned that they will not be permuted
to take part in any contest between Mexico and
Texas, or to pass into the territory of the latter
with hostile intent; and that the amount of their
annuities will be stopped if they disobey this
order, without prejudice to other measures which
will be taken to enforce its observance
Upon the first receipt of the intelligence of the
appearance of the small-pox among tne tribes
on the Missouri river, supplies of money and of
vaccine matter were liberally furnished, the em-
ployment of physicians was authorized, and
instructions given for the immediate and thorough
vaccination of the Indians. The repoits, thus
far, do not show satisfactory to what extent this
duty has been performed
The subject of our Indian affairs, confessedly
the most difficult and complicated under the su-
pervision of the Department, being the last year
entirely new to me, I foroore to suggest any
changes in their management , but subsequent
expeuence and reflection have convinced me that
the present system is defective, and that the evils
which spring from it will not be remedied by the
measures lieietofore recommended, nor by the bill
which, at the last session of Congress, received
the sanction of one branch of the Legislature. It
is unnecessary, howevei, to discuss the defects
or merits of this bill, because the preliminary
condition to its being carried into execution—the
previous consent of the tribes—cannot be com-
plied with The Choctaws and Cherokees have
expressed their unwillingness to emer into the
confederation, oi to adopt the form of govern-
ment the bill pioposes If even the most insig-
nificant changes m the settled foims of govern-
ment require to be considered with great cate, how
much more cautious ought wo to be in any at-
tempts to introduce those forms among a people
who have hitherto lived with scarcely any knowl-
edge of them 1 would recommend, as the first
step, that the tribes should be encouiaged to
adopt asystem of self-governmentadapted to the.r
wants and condition, with which there should be
as little interference on our part as possible , and
that their chiefs be invited to attend an annual
council, at which the agents of the Government
and the commanding officer of the nearest station
should be present In this manner the Govern-
ment would exercise a salutary influence over
them, become acquainted with their wanls, and
heal their differences with each othei It appears
to me, likewise, that the Indian agents should
not be attached to any one fibe, as experience
proves that they become so identified with those
whose peculiar interests are confided to their ewe,
that they imbibe their prejudices and espouse
their quarrels It ought to be in tne power of
Government to change their re ideiite from time
to time, and by assembling them once a year in
general council w th tl e cmefs of all the tribes,
they will undeistand and seek to piomote the
general interests of the red men
i would recommend that the system hitherto
puisued for the education of the Indians, by which
alone theircivibzation can be effected, becnangetl
At present the Indian youth receives an educa'ion
which is altogether useless, to h.m when he returns
to his home in the western wilds He can read,
write, and cipher, and in his native village there
are no books to real, no writings requued,and
none but the most Simple accounts kept, such as
are reckoned on the fingers and notched on a suck.
He has acquued no knowledge which can be use-
fully applied for hisown benefii or for thai of his
people, and he has forgotten how to trap and hunt
As a mattei of course, then, he and his acquisi-
tions are despised, and the nilf-edueated savage
too often becomes a profligate and drunken vaga-
bond The remedy for this evil appears to me to
be the introduction of manual labor schools, where
the Indian, at the same time that he receives the
rudiments of educationand is taught the Christian
faith, will acquiie some knowledge of farming and
of the useful arts, which will secure to him the
admuation and gratitude of his countrymen on
his return among them, and enable him, not only
to render them the most essential services, but to
teach them by his example the vast advantages to
be derived from knowledge, and induce them to
become a civilized community
The important interests involved in the proper
administration of Indian affaiis,and tne great dis-
tance of the theatei of their management from the
supervisory power at Washington, require, m my
opinion, that there should be attached to the office
of the commissioner an inspector charged to visit,
fiom time to time, the stations nf the disbursing
officers and Indiun agents, inspect their books,
examine into their proceedings, view the condition
of the different tribes, and furnish such a report
as will enable the Department to correct abuses,
to understand and provide for the wants of the
Indians, and, generally, to extend over the whole
mattei a more complete supervision than has here-
tofore been found practicable By such means,
in conjunction with a more liberal policy towards
the interpre ers, who exercise great influence over
the Indians, by a proper attention to the chiefs,
through whom alone the people can be approached 
and who ought, by every fair means, to be con-
ciliated and attached to the United States-, and by
the cooperation of the traders, whom I have always
found ready to lend their aid to the Government,
reasonable hopes may be entertained of extending
the blessings and advantages of Christianity and
civilization to the Indian race.

J   R  POINSETT.
To the President op the United States.
Report of th.e Secretary of the Navy.
Navy Department,      >
November 30, 1838.£
Sm: In the performance of a duty annually
devolving on this Department, I submit the fol-
lowing report.
The sqjadron employed in the Mediterranean
during the past year, undei Commodore Jesse D.
Elliott, consisted of two frigates, a sloop of war,
and a schooner These vessels, with the excep-
tion of the sloop of war, having returned home
either for repairs, or in consequence of the terms
of service of their crews having expired, will be
replaced by a ship of the line, a frigate of equal
force, and a dispatcn brig or schooner.
The whole will be under the orders of Commo-
dore Isaac Hull
Although some of the causes which originally
dictated the policy of employing a portion of our
navy in the Mediterranean have, in a great meas-
ure, ceased, still it is believed that as a school of
discipline under experienced officers, as a means
of exhibiting a portion of our naval force m con-
tact and compauson with that of the principal
maritime States of Europe, and for the purpose of
a'Tording countenance and protection to our com-
meice, a peiseverance in this policy will equally
contubute to the good of the sei vice and the honor
of I he United States
The squadion now m the Pacific, under Com-
moi'oie Hemy E Ballaid, comprises one ship of
the une, two sloops of war, and two schooners
fnese last requiunu extensive repairs havebeen
ordeied home the ensuing spring, or as soon after
as the public mteiest wnl admit, and the ship of
the line may also be expected to return about the
same time, as the terms ol service of most of her
crew will then be about expuing
The unsettled and precarious relations subsist-
ing oetween theSouth American States bordeiing
on the Pacific, in my opinion, tender it essential
to the protection of our commerce, that at least an
equal force should be maintained in that quarter
Accoidingiy, measures will be taken to replace
the vessels ordered home by others not less effi-
cient for that service
The force operating on the coast of Brazil, under
Commodore John B Nicolson, consists of one
razee, one ¡>loop of war, and one brig No change
is at present contemplated The present force is
deemed adequate to the piotection of out com-
merce in that quarter, and it is believed that no
reduction would be consistent with the attainment
of thai object
At the date of the last report of the Secretary
of the Navy, the squadron employed on the West
India, station and in the Gulf of Mexico, under
