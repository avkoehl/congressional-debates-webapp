WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, June 1, 1864.

Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

By the specific terms of your agreement with the Department the 100-days" men were to be mustered in when a regiment was full to the minimum, and the term of service was to be reckoned from that time. This agreement was sanctioned by Congress, and it formed the basis of the appropriation. To muster in by companies would be a plain violation of law, which this Department cannot commit. The clothing is on hand, ready for distribution on mustering of the regiments.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., June 1, 1864.

Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis:

I think it can, especially as present appearances are not very encouraging to disloyalty. I believe the Governor is a firm Union man.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Honorable HENRY WILSON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, June 2, 1864.

EDWIN M. STANTON,
