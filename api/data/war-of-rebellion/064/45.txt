Memorandum of information obtained from a lieutenant of the rebel forces, captured May 23, 1864, in attempting to pass our lines from the opposite side of the river: Force on Tunica Bend consists of Eighth Battalion Louisiana Heavy Artillery (Major Ogden), 500 men and four rifled guns. Colonel Gober is sent by General Polk's order to take command of this force, with two more companies. All the force between here and Vicksburg is 3,000 cavalry, under General Adams. General Maury, at Mobile, has sent all but 6,000 or 7,000 men and his siege artillery to Dalton; twenty-seven car-loads left May 1. General Polk has Adams, Forrest, French, and Loring under his command. His command is called the Third Division; is 30,000 strong. Polk is on Johnston's left. About 20,000 have left to re-enforce Maury at Dalton, and 10,000 are at and about Camp Moore, &amp;c. Slaughter and Tilghman went with Polk to Dalton.
