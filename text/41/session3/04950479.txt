charles pomeroy.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, from
the Committee of Claims, reported a bill (H.
R. No. 2706) for the relief of Charles Pome-
roy, late receiver of public moneys at Fort
Dodge, Iowa ; which was read a first and sec-
ond time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill was read. It authorizes and directs
the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to Charles
Pomeroy, late receiver of public moneys at
Fort Dodge, in the State of Iowa, the amount
found t.o be overpaid by and due to him in the
adjustment of his accounts as such receiver by
the accounting officers of the Treasury.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, moved
to reconsider the vote by which the bill was
passed; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
The report accompanying the bill was ordered
to be printed.
joseph s. pinch and company.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, also,
from the same committee, reported back with-
out amendment, and with the recommendation
that it do pass, the bill (S. No. 980) for the
relief of Joseph S. Finch & Co., of Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
a third reading.
The bill was read. It is recited in the pre-
amble that forty-one thousand four hundred
and seventy-seven and eighty-two hundredths
proof gallons of distilled spirits, distilled by
Joseph S. Finch & Co., at their distillery in
Alleghany county, Pennsylvania, and stored
in their distillery warehouse near Pittsburg,
were, on the 14th day of May, 1869, destroyed ]
and wholly lost by the falling of said distillery j
warehouse, without any negligence or fault on
the part of said Joseph S. Finch & Co.; that
said spirits were subject to the tax and duty of
fifty cents per proof gallon, amounting to the
sum of $20,738 91, for which said JosephS.
Finch & Co. had given bonds, as required by
law, and that the above facts constitute equit-
able grounds for relief from the payment of
said taxes. The bill authorizes and directs the
Secretary of the Treasury to abate and remit
the taxes on said spirits so destroyed and lost,
and to credit the amount of the same on the
bonds of said Joseph S. Finch & Co. given to
secure the payment of the same.
Mr. ALLISON. Before that bill is read the
third time I would like to have some little
explanation of it.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. This
case is precisely similar to two cases that were
reported from our committee and to one or
two cases that were reported from the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means at the last session
of Congress. We then discussed the question
fully, and the House came to the conclusion,
I believe, that in all similar cases it was proper
that relief should be granted.
In this case the facts show that there was
stored in the_warehouse of these claimants a
certain quantity of whisky; that by the destruc-
tion of the warehouse a large portion of this
whisky was destroyed. The store-keeper, who
has the record of the entire amount contained
in the warehouse, certifies to the amount that
was actually in the store-house and.also to the
amount that was gathered up and saved out
of the wreck. The amount saved is deducted
from the total amount, and this bill provides
simply to relieve the parties from taxes upon
the amount that was actually destroyed. The
case went to the Internal Revenue Office for
relief. After a thorough examination by that
office, the solicitor recommended that relief
should be granted. The Secretary of the
Treasury having doubts as to his authority,
from the facts, to grant the relief asked, sent
it to the Attorney General, who upon a thor-
ough investigation of the facts decided that the
Secretary had no authority to relieve from tax, -
but that it was a proper case to come before
Congress. Accordingly the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue referred the case to Congress with
the statement that in their opinion it was a
proper case for congressional action. There-
fore, acting upon that suggestion, and being
satisfied in regard to the amount that was
actually destroyed, we report this bill, and, in
conformity with the precedent established in
the previous cases I have cited, recommend
that these parties be relieved from paying
taxes on what was actually destroyed. This is
a Senate bill, and we recommend its passage
without amendment.
The bill was ordered to be read a third time ;
and it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
henry a. messinger.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, from
the same committee, reported back, with the
recommendation that the same do pass, a bill
(H. R. No. 2493) for the relief of Henry A.
Messinger, of Shelby county, Missouri.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, directs the Secre-
tary of the Treasury to issue a duplicate of
coupon bond No. 14033, for $1,000, issued
under the act of March 3, 1863, and payable
i iu 1881, to Henry A. Messinger, upon proof
satisfactory to the Secretary of the destruction
of the original, and upon the said Messinger
giving bond with sufficient surety to indemnify
the United States against any loss resulting
therefrom.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
j accordingly read the third time and passed.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, moved
I to reconsider the vote by which the bill was
i passed; and also moved that the motion to
I reconsider be laid on the table.
| The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I
move that the report accompanying this bill
be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
