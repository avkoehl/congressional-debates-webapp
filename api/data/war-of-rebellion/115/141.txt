Superintendent of Police, New York.

SIR: Herewith I transmit and extract from an intercepted letter written by William L. Yancey,* an agent in England of the persons in surrection against the authority of the Government of the United States, addressed to his son who appears to be a captain in the forces of the insurgents at Mobile, Ala. From this extract you will learn the names of the parties in new York through whom the son is requested to send a reply. I deem it important that a watch should be kept over John Monroe & Co., and have the request that you will cause it to be done and report to me by telegraph whether in your judgment it is advisable to arrest them or any of them.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,
