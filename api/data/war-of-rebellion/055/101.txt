Major-General REYNOLDS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A few moments after the first guns of artillery were fired at Chattanooga this morning, the enemy's infantry was discovered moving rapidly up the hill a little below and opposite this point. A column of a brigade has passed since first discovered. The column is still moving on. They seem to be moving for action. No wagons are to be seen with it.

I send this by my medical director, Surgeon Payne, who can give particulars.

Very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-Since writing the above the column is seen going up the river, and a large train is also seen moving up the river some distance above this point.
