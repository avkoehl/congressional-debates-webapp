P. S.-I inclose a communication just received from Colonel Lynch, First Brigade. Captain Ricker, the officer mentioned in it, observed the enemy moving apparently to our left, before he left the line of works, going down the river two or three miles. He observed the heavy column mentioned in the dispatch as moving to our right. He made his observation from the Mills house, where a good view was observed. I recommend that a signal station be established there in the morning. I consider it evident that the movements to our left observed to-day were intended to mislead us, and that they are now moving a considerable force to our right.

Respectfully,

N. A. MILES,

Brigadier-General.
