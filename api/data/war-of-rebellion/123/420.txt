P. H. WATSON, Esq.,

Assistant Secretary of War:

In addition to the seven regiments of infantry and one of cavalry mentioned in your dispatch, and for which clothing and arms have been ordered, but not all yet arrived, there are two regiments of infantry and one of cavalry now full, for which clothing and arms have not been ordered. Can they be furnished? Blankets for three regiments are needed immediately, as the men are suffering for want of them.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

We have commenced six new regiments of three-years's men under the President's last two calls for 600,000 troops. None of said regiments are full, but two will be within three days. Our frontiers are attacked by the Indians, and four companies of the new regiments have been detailed to protect our Western settlements. About 2,500 men are required to fill the regiments now organizing, and it will require two weeks from to-day to raise that number. No new regiment has gone to the field.
