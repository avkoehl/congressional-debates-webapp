mitted through the same wire in a given time: that
an individual can learn to operate in a very short
time, when compared with the great practice ne-
cessary to attain the requisite skill to transmit in-
telligence with facility by the means now used,
thus diminishing the liability to error, each letter
being formed by mechanical means with an accu-
racy difficult of obtamment by the hand alone;

meroe.

INCREASE OF THE COMMISSARIAT DEPART-
MENT.
Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, from the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs, to which was referred so
much of the President's message as relates to mil-
itary affairs, reported a bill to increase the com-
missariat of the United States army; which was
read.
Mr. D. asked that the bill might be read a sec-
ond time; and the bill was read, as follows:
Be it enacted, 4"c., That there be added to the Subsistence
Department loin commi&saries of subsistence, wiih the
lank of captain, to be taken lrom the line of the army.
Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi. Mr. President, I
ask the unanimous consent of the Senate to the
passage of this bill at this time. 1 will merely
state that I have a letter from the Secretary of
War, and one from the Commissary General, both
of whom approve the bill. I will read these let-
ters, as they will explain the case better than I can
do it otherwise. The letter of the Commissary
General states thatâ
" The addition of Oregon, California, Santa F6, and
Texas to our territory, compels me to ask an increase of the
number of officers in the Subsistence Department. Each of
theae military commands leqiures the presence of the Com-
missariat, and from no point occupied by sny officers can
one be spaied for these duties.
" During the past year I was compelled to ask the detail,
for duty under my oiders, of several officeis of e\peiience
from the line of the army. The nece<-ity for such a~s&iÂ£t;mce
is of a permanent character, and I would therefore respect-
fully a^k that there be added to the Subsistence Department
four Commissuii.es of Subsistence, with the rank of captain,
to be taken fiom the line of the army."
The letter from the Secretary of War accompa-
nies this, and recommends to the favorable-con-
sideration of the Committee on Military Affairs
the report from the Commissary General of Sub-
sistence, setting forth the necessity for an increase
of the number of officers in this department, and
asking the addition thereto of four commissaries
of Subsistence.
I will state that the four officers which it is pro-
posed to add will be taken from the line of the
army. Officers are now employed by detail in the
performance of this duty, and it is proposed to
transfer to that department officers of the staff, by
which companies will be discharged from the ser-
vice by detail, and have their full complement of
officers in the line of the army. It adds no officers;
but, by the transfer of officers to this department,
there will be a promotion of supernumerary
officers to the places made vacant by the transfer.
I hope the bill may have the unanimous consent
to its consideration.
Mr. HALE. I object.
Objection being made, the bill was not further
acted upon.
BILL INTRODUCED ON LEAVE.
Mr. FOOTE, in pursuance of notice, asked and
obtained leave to introduce a bill to amend an act
entitled "An act to establish the tcrriloiial gov-
ernment of Oregon," and " An act to establish the
territorial government of Minnesota;" which was
read a first and second time by its title, and re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
JAPAN AND THE ORIENTAL NATIONS.
Mr. HAMLIN moved to take up the resolutions
