me from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, and without subjecting brave men to the ungracious task of pursuing a fleeing foe that did not want to fight. As for myself, I know my motives, and challenge the instance during the past four years where an armed and defiant foe stood before me that I did not go in for a fight, and I would blush for shame if I had ever insulted or struck a fallen foe. The instant the terms of surrender were approved by General Grant, I made my Orders, Numbers 65, assigning to each of my subordinate commanders his share of the work, and, with General Grant's approval, made Special Field Orders, Numbers 66, putting in motion my old army (no longer required in Carolina) northward for Richmond. * General Grant left Raleigh at 9 a.m. of the 27th, and I glory in the fact that during his three days' stay with me I did not detect in his language or manner one particle of abatement in the confidence, respect, and affection that have existed between us throughout all the varied events of the past war, and though we have honestly differed in opinion in other cases, as well as this, still we respected each other's honest convictions.

I still adhere to my then opinions, that by a few general concessions, "glittering generalities," all of which in the end must and will be conceded to the organized States of the South, that this day there would not be an armed battalion opposed to us within the broad area of the dominions of the United States. Robbers and assassins must in any event result from the disbandment of large armies, but even these should be and could be taken care of by the local civil authorities without being made a charge on the national treasury. On the evening of the 28th, having concluded all business requiring my personal attention at Raleigh, and having conferred with every army commander and delegated to him the authority necessary for his future action, I dispatched my headquarters wagons by land alenteenth Corps, the office in charge of General Webster from New Berne to Alexandria, Va., by sea, and in person, accompanied only by my personal staff, hastened to Savannah, to direct matters in the interior of South Carolina and Georgia. I had received across the rebel telegraph wires cipher dispatches from General Wilson, at Macon, to the effect that he was in receipt of my Orders, Numbers 65, and would send General Upton's division to Augusta, and General McCook's division to Tallahassee, to receive the surrender of those garrisons, take charge of the public property, and execute the paroles required by the terms of surrender. He reported a sufficiency of forage for his horses in Southwest Georgia, but asked me to send him a supply of clothing, sugar, coffee, &amp;c., by way of Augusta, Ga., whence he could get it by rail.

I therefore went rapidly to Goldsborough and Wilmington, reaching the latter city at 10 a.m. of the 29th, and the same day embarked for Hilton Head in the blockade-runner Russia, Captain A.m. Smith. I found General Q. A. Gillmore, commanding Department of the South, at Hilton Head, on the evening of April 30, and ordered him to send to Augusta at once what clothing and small-stores he could spare for General Wilson, and to open up a line of certain communication and supply with him at Macon. Within an hour the captured steam-boats Jeff. Davis and Amazon, both adapted to the shallow and crooked navigation of the Savannah River, were being loaded, the one at Savannah and the other at Hilton Head. The former started up the river on the 1st of May, in charge of a very intelligent officer (whose name I cannot recall) and forty-eight men, all the boat could carry, with orders to
