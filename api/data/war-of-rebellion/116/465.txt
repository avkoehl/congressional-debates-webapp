Sandusky, April 20, 1862.

Honorable DAVID TOD, Governor of Ohio.

DEAR SIR: I am directed by the War Department to cause all the officers prisoners of war at Camp Chase to be removed to the depot at Sandusky, and I have the honor to request that you will give the necessary instructions to have the transfer made in parties of about 200 at a time. The depot will accommodate in addition to those now there from 800 to 1,000.

I am also authorized by the War Department to call on you for another company for the depot gard, and as it is required immediately I would suggest that a company from one of the incomplete regiments of Ohio volunteers be assigned to this service, If this is not practicable I will be much obliged to you if you will detach a company for temporary duty at the depot till one company can be organized for the purpose. The company may be divided into two parts and prisoners. It should be furnished to me of all prisoners of war sent from Camp Chase to the depot, showing the State rank, regiment and company of each man and when and where captured as required by paragraph IX, Army Regulations, published in general orders from the War Department of April 2, 1862.

Further accommodations for officers are being erected at the depot, but in the meantime quarters for those recently captured may be
