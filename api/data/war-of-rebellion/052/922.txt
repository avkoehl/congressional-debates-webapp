LOUDON, September 28, 1863

General BURNSIDE:

I have just returned from Philadelphia. The enemy are advancing under Forrest. Prisoners state his force to be one army corps. Wolford is falling back on this place. I think it would be prudent to send down General Hascall's division at once.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUDON, September 28, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Colonel Wolford reports the enemy following him slowly. He has taken position at Philadelphia, where he says he shall fight; he represents the force of the enemy as very large, and hears of another body on the left flank, which is represented by citizens as a formidable force.

J. WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 29, 1863.

(Received 2.10 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

We have requisition from General Banks' command for 600 wagons and teams. We have also unfinished requisitions for wagons and animals from General Rosecrans. Which shall have the preference, as we cannot at once supply both?

ROBT. ALLEN,

Chief Quartermaster.

The wagons, or at least a part of them, can be sent from Philadelphia. Should you request it I will order them immediately.
