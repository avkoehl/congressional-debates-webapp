Richmond, Va., April 28, 1862.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Department of the Peninsula:

GENERAL: You informed me that seven or eight regiments whose time was out have reorganized, and wish to be informed whether they are entitled to their discharge. I think not, unless they were induced to remain and reorganize by promises of a discharge. If a regiment whose time is out, but who have not been mustered out of service, reorganize under the conscription act voluntarily and without being induced to do so by promises of a discharge in a short time, they may be regarded as waiving the right to be discharged, and enrolled subsequently and as volunteering in an existing regiment in conformity with the provisions of the conscript law. Should you lose any part of your command under this decision, it is matter for regret, but is unavoidable. We have heard of the arrival of two cargoes, containing about 9,000 Enfield rifles and 1,000 barrels of powder. We hope to give you an ample supply of ammunition and to send two banded rifled 32-pounders to Yorktown, which may be relied on. They are now nearly complete.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
