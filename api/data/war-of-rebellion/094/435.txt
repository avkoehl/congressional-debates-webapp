encamped near here during some time I don't believe I will fare as well as I expected, but I will get enough, no doubt. I am preparing to bake bread at Bough's Mills, four miles from here, and at Cowpen Mills, two miles off. They will forage, grind, and bake corn-cakes, by detail, all night, and as long as the general leaves me here, until I get four days' rations of bread. I am on the Savannah rod, sixty miles (good road) to Columbia, thirty-eight to Pulaski, to Eastport forty-two--all good roads. I can travel a country that has not been foraged in to either Waterloo or Eastport, sixteen miles and a half from Florence. Four miles farther on along Shoal Creek, I can get more forage the people say, but General Wilson said about six miles, and I stopped accordingly, and am in reach of both mills. I hear of small guerrilla parties, and will watch for them. The band spoken of by General Wilson is somewhere up near Lexington. One foraging party has returned, and reports abundant forage only one mile and a half distant; also, a band of six in rebel uniform.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

P. S. - I will send you some chickens to-morrow morning.
