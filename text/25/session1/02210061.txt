APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Con©.....1st Sess.
Making public officers depositories—Mr. Núes.
Senate.
his amendment does not go far enough , for w ith-
out some expiess legal provision to that effect, the
Secretary of the 1 reasury could not, ai the law
now stands, employ these local banks as fiscal
agents. What then does the Senator purpose to do
•wuh the public mone/ until the banks shall resume
specie payment' It is supposed tnat oo long as
specie shall bear a premium in the maiket—so
long as any portion of our foreign debt shall re-
main unsatisfied—this state of things must con-
tinue
I can not, Mr President, from anv View which I
cio take of the proposition of the Senator from
Virginia, give to it my support
The Scnatoi from South Carolina has pioposed
an amendment to the bill, which I shall, with some
reluctance, suppoit I should have much preferred
the bill as it came fiom the hands of the committee
The principle involved in the Senator's amend-
ment was matter of much discussion befire the
committee, and it was their conclusion, that a le-
gard to the public interests required nothing more
of them than to íeport the bill as it was reported,
leaving the law of 1789 and the resolution of 1816
as obligatory as thev had ever been The commit-
tee believed that no inconvenience or embarrass-
ment whatever would arise, either to the Govern-
ment, to the receivers or to the puohc creditors, bj
leaving the law of 1789 and the íesolution of 1816
as they now stand, and in my judgment, the bill
will not be improved by adopting the amendment
proposed by the Senator from South Carolina It,
in effect, re-enacts the law of 1789 after the year
1841, and to a certain extent, it, in effect, re-enacts
the joint resolution of 1816 until 1841 Without
the resolution of 1816, and without the amendment
of the Senator from Sjuth Caiolina, the practice of
the Government won d sro on as it did anter oi to
1816, with a propel legard to mlmdual conf-
luence and to public security
Mr. President, I voted for the deposite act of
June, 1836, and, with the Senatorfrom New York,
(Mr Tallmadge,) I have seen no cause to regret it
That vole was the deliberate act ot my best judg-
ment. It was given, not as has been avowed else-
where, to make a gratuity to the States, or to make
a systemat'c distribution of the common fund
among the several States of this confederacy No,
s r, I voted for the deposite act w ith no Mich view,
and for no such puriose I voted for it, as it was
upon its fa" , pnd as t was intended lo he—a mne
de^onle bill It cannot fa I to b-retobee id,fi itgieat
amounts of the public treasiue h-nl accumulated at
particular points , that so great had been the accu-
mulation at tho places of d"pesi'e m the State of
New York, as u oll as m some other States of the
Union, that it was a"eged on this fioti, tha< the
public fjnds «ere thus put ii jeopards , and
again and again vas it reiterate', th it it
it was the policy of the then adminis ration so to
contioi the public treasure ps to influence pub' c
poht cs This v is mattei of cnaige tnd to ao
away so groundless an imputation, and to pro' ide
further for a transfer of portions of the public mo
ney then m depositp m local banks, to the treasu-
ries of tne resp-ctive States, I supported the depo-
sue act of June, 1836 JSot a sentiment did I then
uttei, not a vote did I then git e, which can be
made to conflict with the uews I now entertain of
that measure It wis a depos te bill throughout
The Committee on Finance, m relation to this
subject, at the piesent session, have repoited a bill
prov idmg tor the postponement of the fourth m-
stalmen* with the Sta'es, und r the deposite ret of
June, 1836 That v 1 fotnd f ivoi with me in the
committee I wasmfavoi of repirtms it to the
Senate I gave it nv vote on its pass-ge, but, sir,
were these proceedings irreoorci ab'e w ith my
support of the deposite act ol 18361 INo, sir no
I have stated the cucumstances which elr tea my
support of that bill It was t5 p-ovide additional
and safe lepositones for the keeping of pos lions of
the public money At that time at had in the va-
rious depositor es more than fortv millions of dollars,
and on the first of January, 1837, we had m de-
posite thirty-set en millions, upon which the aot
was intended to operate But, sir, notwithstanding
the peculiar phraseology of that a,ct, u was never
intended by its friend, that the Government of the
Un'ied States should part with its cortrol over that
portion of the public funds w hich had been, pre-
vious to the 1st January, 1837, in. deposite with the
banks, and was then in deposite with the States It
was the propeity cf the Government, and subject
to its control, m accordance with the provisions of
the deposite act itself But it w as onlv that portion
of the public money actuallv deposited with the
States, w hich could be controlled by the terms of
that act
That part of the thu-ty-seven millions which had
not, in point of fact, reached the treasuries of the
respective States, could not be controlled by the act
of June, 1836 It was subject to public appropri-
ation It had not been deposited wi h the States,
and the States could not a«sert any claim to hold
the public money under the deposite act, which
had not actually been deposited with them The
Secrefny ot th Treasury had the samp control,
the same power, over the nine millions then in the
local banks, as hp had over any other portion of
the public funds It was subject to be controlled
by the legislation of Congress i* was noth ng more
or less t ían a portion of the public mone- , and like
any other portion, w as alike liable to be absoibed
b> public appropriations
The Government, then, could ngntfully use this
portion of Ihe puohc Junds, and consequently, on
the 1st of Octobei, 1836, there would be no surplus
which could be ('«posited with the States The
necessary and unavoidable demands of the Go-
vernment had taken up the whole amount in the
Treasury, and hence there could be no surplus,
and for one, sir, I could not lend my aid in favoi
of anv measure to borrow money lot the purpose
of depositing the same money with the States I
theif'bre voted fo*" the bill to postnone th" fourth
instalment, and I \(tel agauist <n" anentlnr*it
offered to tia' bill b) 'he ^ a-to'ft >m Pcnnsv va-
ma, because I couid not give my a d to anj propo-
s tion whicn should treat this deposite with ihe
States as a donation to me States, or which should
give to the Secretary of the Treasury any It ss con-
trol of lhat portion of the public funds than he had
over anv other
It has been orten said during this debate, ihat
the recommendations con ained in the Message of
the President, and that the measures renor*ed
by the Committee on Finance, art not calculated to
reliev e the people from thtir pie«ent embariass-
n ents, that t ie} look evc'ns vel) to the ?co r-
m >d .lion of the Gove-nment The Senat • ri< m
Ken'iitky contended that the posrponmeat of the
dtpos te of the fourtn instalment with the States,
nas cakulated to l crease ihe pecun ary pressuie,
and that the bill p ovilmg fort ,e issue (f T easury

the Slates of the to irth insta'ment, is a lehef mea-
suie not only to the depos to íes of he fiubhc no-
ne}, but to the peoji'e themselves It has been
said here and eisewhere, that ihe amount iequ>red
to be deposited with the States on the fust oi Octo-
ber ne\t, w<is within d.e con rol of the Treasury
Depaitmenl that theie weie avalab'e means in

be so, Mr President, th" course o the b ciet-rv is

there is no occasion foi the action of Congress
the law s m full torce, and the dm y ol ¡he ^ Cre-
tan of th  Tieastiry is fn v set foith
But the fact s not so , md it s the defic em v o<"
means that has called for tne mtei posit on of C ti-
gress If the Treasui) was well suppliel w th
available funds, how 1 as it happened that, with s0
great unammitv, the Senate has, at this sC s n
authorized the loan often millions of dabais t If
the operations of the Governmsnt could be earned
'  forward unaided, why has the Executive been, au
thonzed, by the act of the Senate, to issue ten mil-
lions of dollars in Treasury notes ? There can be
no mistake upon this point, it is too plain for-ar-
gument , and the fact is incontrovertible that, if the
fourth instalment shall be required to be deposited
with the States on tin. 1st of October next, Congress
must provide the means They must authorize a
loan to some amount for that express object, lo
enable the Treasury Depaitment to exesutethe act.
Whelher this has resulted from the inability of
the deposite banks to fulfil their engagements' to
the Government, or whether it has happened in,
consequence of the failure of the merchants to pay
their duty bonds, or whether from both causes, it
is the same to the Treasury Departmem Availa-
ble means are not there, and will not and can not
be in the Treasury on the first of October, sufficient
lor the object, and hence the necessity of action on
the part of Congress, either to provide the means, or
to postpone the instalment
rntertammg this opinion, Mr President, I must
differ with the Senator from Kentucky I can not
but regard the postponement of the deposite of the
fourth instalment with the States, at a time like
this, as a relief measure—a relief to the local banks,
to the depositories of the public money, and, of con-
sequence, a rehef to then debtors, to Ike veople
themsehes.
If nine millions of dollars are to be deposited
with the States, that amount must be drawn from
the debtcrs to the Got ernment, from the deposite
banks an 1 the importing merchants If a requisi-
tion shall be m?de on (he banks and upon the mer-
chants, the) would be competed to enforce collec-
tions from their debtors, and theie is scarcely aa
individual in the community, however onscure,
butwoull feel tins postponement as a relief and
a""omn odation to hunse'f Ihe banks and the
nuchi, s are ti e grea'eieditoiso the commamty,
•ma anj and evcrv meisiue v Inch shall íelieie
diem,'s m'practice and m effect a relief to the people.
The postponement bill is a re! ef measure. The
Tieasuiy note bill is a relief measure; it is a mere
temporaiy expedient, an authority to pled?e the
ciedit of the Gov eminent, una! the debtors to the
Gov ernment can pav their dues The oootpone-
ment or the payment of the merchants' bonds is a
relief measure—directly to Ihe merchants, but indi-
rectly and in effect to the people
The accommodation proposed to be extended to
the deposile banks is a relief measu p, giving time
to 1l ose mstm f ops, an 1 emb' i g thoso it stuutions
to give time to their dtbtors The warehouse bill
is a gicat ¡elief measuie, reauinng cash payment
