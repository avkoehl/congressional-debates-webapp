Brown's Ferry. Colonel Le Duc has been notified to see that you are supplied with forage and rations. Prisoners report that but two regiments of the enemy were in Lookout Valley this morning. Two brigades have been seen to pass over the point of Lookout and into the valley nearly out of range of our guns. So far as we now know, they have only six guns in the valley.

By command Major-General Thomas:

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

OCTOBER 27, 1863-2.20 p.m.

General THOMAS:

Two brigades, if not more, of mixed troops have passed over Lookout. They pass above the white house at the upper edge of the clearing. Shelling does not entirely prevent, though it greatly impeded their passage. There must be in Lookout Valley many more men of the enemy than General Smith has.

Respectfully,

WHITAKER,

Brigadier-General.

OCTOBER 27, 1863-2.30 p.m.

General WILLIAM F. SMITH:

Enemy have passed foot of mountain cliff on Lookout Mountain in heavy column in spite of my fire; coming this way.

W. C. WHITAKER,

Brigadier-General.

OCTOBER 27,[1863]-3.30 p.m.

General REYNOLDS:

This place cannot be carried now. I shall come into headquarters unless the general moves. A regiment has just gone up the mountain and all is quiet, so I suppose the sharpshooters have left the Suck.

SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

OCTOBER 27, 1863. (Received 4.40 p.m.)

General THOMAS and

General SMITH:

General Howard is here, and General Hooker is near in person. Howard had a slight skirmish, which detained them only a few moments. Had 5 or 6 wounded.

HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.
