question, that Xsnould state the actual position of it upon the
treaties between tlis United States and Great Britain
By the tieaty ol Paris, September 3, 1783, oiu boundaiy is,
bsginnmga th< Lake of the Woods, " thence through the «aid
lake to the most northwester1! point thereof, and from thence
on a due we t comae to the river Mississippi, thence, by aJ
line to be drawn along the middle of tne «aid i ivei Mississippi,'
m confoim o* with the provisions of the treaty of Versailles
before cited, an 1 so proceeding down the river to the beundsof
Louisiana and Honda in that direction
Ilk, annexation of Louisiana to the United States changed, of
course our northwestern frontiei But no new convention was
immediately concluded, defining this on the side of Great Bn
tain The treaty of Ghent December 24, 1814, proceeds on the
assumption of limits according to the status ante bellum U
provides fot ascertaining the noithwestern point ofthe Lake of
the Woods, but it 5oe*> no farther westward in that direction
the line is continued by the convention of October 20, 1818,
* from the Lak* ofthe Woods to the Stony Mountains, along
the parallel oí 49 degrees, m just application of the tieaty of
Utrecht By the same convention, it is agreed, that any countiy
that may be cla-med by either paity on the northwest coast of
Amen a, westward of LheStonv Mountain , shall, together with
its harbors, bays and creeks, and the navigation oí all rivers
within the ¡>ame, be free and open, for the term of ten year>, to
tne vessels, citizens, and subject" ofthe two powers, this agree
ment not to bo cons rued to the piejudice of any claim which
either ofthe p «-tie  may have to any pai t of the said country
Which agreement, by the convention of August 6, 1837, wai
con mued indefinitely subject to be terminated by either party
on twelvemonths' notice
I desire to «ee th's agreement terminated as soon as po ible
It gives no lung co the United ¡states, foi we have no occa ion to
a^k the conten of Great Britain to u^e the harbors bays, ci eeks,
and rivers  of our own teintory It gives eveiy thin? to Great
Britain, because without it hei vessels and subjects would be
mere mtiudet sand intulopursina country which f e'ongs to u*
I desire to see the treaty notice given by the Umkd States, and
piovision made by ¡aw for the occupuon of the countiy by its
nghtfulso/ere gn Ihe notice, we may jest assured will never
be gn en by Great Britain Her policy is procrastination m this
case, asm that of our noitheastein fiontier and for precisely
the same reason In bo h case she ha*, undei guise of tempo
rary agreements, availed hei self of our neglect, oi at lea t of our
unsuspecting §ood faith to insinúa e herself into arnwl posies
sio i ol the terutoiy in dispute To settle the question, is to oust
the mtmdei To be &uie, there is a s'ipulation that the agree
ment shall nof prejudice the rights of either party, but it does
prejudice our rights, deeply, latally, as I will prove to this
lioiue by the most authentic facts
U"fo"t,I enter jpon this the more impoi ant and interesting
paitof JhN subject, I nave a concluding suggestion to make on
the question of title I derive my I nowledge of this from
bjoks, c&peci i1 y the negotiations oí 1823 and 1826, (Doc 19th
C ingress, Kt session, E^ec No 65 and Doc 20th Cong 1st

act, in one common interest, must be formed on such prim lples
ah that, indue time, the latter may succeed the former, in coi

commercial association with the Hudson's Bay Company is
the important measure winch I would propose, and the trade
might be earned on with a very supenor degree of advantage,
both public and privite, under the privilege of then ehartei
By enjoying the privilege of the company'  charter, though
but for a limited period, there are adventurers who would be
willing aq they are able, to engage in and carry on the proposed
commeicia! undeitaking, as well as to give the most complete
and satisfactory security to Government for the fulfilment of its
contiact with the company It would, at the same time, be
equally necessary to add a bimilar privilege of trade on the Co
Jurobia nvei, and its tributary waters >J

Such would be the field fot commercial enterprise and incal
culable woull be the produce of it, when supported by the
operations of that fuedit and capital which Great Britain so
pie eminently possesses The  would this countiy begin to be
reinuneiated for the expenses it has sustained in di co\enng

capital, or the desire of conciliating futuie confidence, look alto

The Hudson's Bay Company, as now organized, I present to
the notice of the people of the United States, as being m itse'f
a great foreign power, most injurious and hostile to then rights
and interests It is to America what the East India Company
isto \sia Dean Tucker descubes it as one of thecormpt mo
monophesof the reign of Charles II (Tucker on Trade, p 68)
And rt is natural enough that a corporation, born of corruption,
should subsist by usurpation Though chattered for a limited
time, which has long since exp red, and though never confirmed
by Parliament, (Chitty on Com vol 1, p 679 ) and so existing
only as a corporation, by sufferance, it claims a more thannnpe
rial sway at, appurtenant to the grant of the trade of Hudson's
bay, commencing midway 1n the Northeastern coast ol the con-
tinent, reaching from Labrador down to near the shores of Lake
Supeuor; thence along the highlands which divid° the wateis
of the Mississippi and Missouri from those of Lake Winnipeg,
and so sweeping around by the easterly side of the Rocky
mountains to the Slave Lake, and back to the shores of the At
lantic—(Bouchette's Brit Dom vol 1, p 32, et seq 1 Thisenor
mousterritoiy, indeed, encioaches directly on the United States,
for the company undertook to sell to the Earl of Selkirk a large
tiaetofmore than one hundred thousand square miles, the
country of the Red river of Lake Winnipeg, which is found to
be cut ofT by our boundary Not content with which, the com
pany has even seated itself down as the mistress of the great
valley of the Columbia Yet its rights are limited to the power
which its establishments give it, and the monopoly which it
usurps o I the tiade of the mterioi, ovei bearing the competition
of private enterprise
1 have English authority to attest the general eharactei of (he
dominion exercised by these mercantile sovereigns, the ífvú
son's Bay and Isoithwest Compan es TI ere is a woric pub
lished by a servant of the Hudson *- Bay Company, in 1770,
who stvles it "a baneful monopoly," who details wnathe plainly
eallsits tyranny and its fiauds, and who savs the as ocíate 
"have undoubtedly forfeited everyjust preten ion ' to continue
a corporation, "by the ill use they have made of this royal
favor"—(Umfreville's Hud B Com p 98) And what the
Northwest Company has been, vveleainf ora the friends of the
Hudson's Bay Company, for (the late) Lord Selkirk says that,
m the wide range of oountry occupied by their forts and trading
po^ts, they "established a mere despotic rule than could be
lound to exist even in any Asiatic Government," (Claims of the
Hud Bay Com p 39,) and v*e are furthei advised that "the
intercourse of the Noithwest Com pany with the Indians, * *
undpi the semblance and disguise of commerce, is an organized
system of rapine " Ard these are the companies we suffer to
remain in the intrusive occupation of the Oregon, most inju
nous!y to us '
Tor I have abundant proofs of the incompatibility of their
conduct with the rights and peace ofthe United States
In the Executive Message of the S3o! Desember it is told u^,
in addition to some other facts
( The Hudson'** Bav Company have also several depots, situ
a'edon watercourse^, in the inteiior o! the country, the pniici
pal o~ic i5.at Fort \ancouver on the northern bank of the Colum
bn uver, about eighty or one hundred miles from its mouth It
is known by information lecently obtained, tha* the English
company have a stcamboa* on this river and that they have a
saw mill, and are cutting timber on thetertitory claimed by the
United States, and are shipping it in considerable quantities to
the Sandwich Islands '
The Ptesident did not gee fit to communicate the particulars
ofthe " information recently obtained," butwe reach these by
the memorial fiom Mr William \ Slacum, the agent employed
by the Coveinment toobt in mfoimation concerning the^et'le
ments in the Oiegon, which memorial was presented to the ie
na eon the 18th December 1&37 maid of a claim prefeired bv
Mi Slacum This document exhibits in detail the facts that
the Hudson s Bay Company have a military post on the Colum
Vna, that they supply munition1' of war to the Ind ans, that they
seek to ahenate the Ind ans from us and that they occupy the
countt y as if it were theirs illustrating, also, the great value and
importance of that country, as well for it elf, as for us uses in
the trale of the Pacific seas It exhibits a faet, also which I
comment to the notice of Mr O Connell who heaps such un
meabiuel invective on the people of this country because of
the exi^tence^of slavery in a portion of the United States,
namely, that, while Cteat Biitam is applauding hetself on the
emuncipation of the African leer in hei West India Colonies,
the Hudson's Bay Companv is introducing a new form of sla\ ery
in the Noithwest, by applvmg it extensively to the American
Indians That this abuse is practised by the Hudson's Bay
Company cannot excuse the Buti&h Government, any moie than
the peipetratio i ol similar and worseabuses m \sia by the East
India Company
There is, in the document before me, (Sen Doc 1828~'9, No
67) a great body of evidence similar to that of Majoi Pilcher,
which I h ive quoted, consisting of letters of Cen Ashley, W L
Sublette Mi A^tor Gen \\ illiam Clark, Gen Casb &<. show
mg how ftfal the influence ofthe Hudson's Bay Company is to
oai own hee trade I will read an extract from one of ihe-*elet
ten (that of Mr Cimbreieng) with his consent This letter,
a 1 housed to Mr Benton, at d dated January 12,1829 say«
"I have m my possession the actual letums of the furs col
lecit d bv the Hudson s Biy Company foi the yeat 182$ which,
af cordm"1" to avaluation madebv one who has a thorough know
ledge of the trad", amount to $894,879 85    The shares of that
compa iy have increased irom X00, ot 40 pet cent befew par,
to .£210 sterling, or HO per cp-h above par    The busmesf-ol
the company has con mued to increase at toe iate of fiom 60
to &10n 0 0 annually The } ros[viou<*. condition ofthe Hudson's
BayCmipanv mayle atmoutel, in some measure to the ad
vantages enjoyed by the Bntish traders, who procure their ma
nufacttiies without duty, while the American traders pay 40pei
cent   andupwaid-- and wl o can send then furs to the Amen
can market, while out tndeis pay a duty mthe B itish market
But tne most important advantage enjoyed by the Hudson's Bay
Company is the admirable haibor at the mouth of the Colum
hie, which we virtually and unfortunately granted them by our
treaty of 181^    That settlement at the mouth of the Columbia
river is now the centie of an immense trade m furs, and, unless
we take somestep to place our traders on an equal footing with
the Briti h and secure to the former the privilege of trading in
safety within oor own dominions at least, our Indian trade must
decline, and we must make up our mmds to surrender the whole
Indian country to Great Britain "
