COLONEL: Telegram from General Grant received. Will be ready, to leave here to-morrow morning. Can I have co-operation of the navy? Can the mail of this brigade (Third Brigade, Third Division, Twenty-fourth Corps) be sent down to-night? If it can be, I should be glad to get it.

FORT MONROE, March 9, 1865-1.30 p.m.

Colonel GEORGE W. BRADLEY,

Chief Quartermaster:

The expedition under General Roberts has returned. They are to go in another direction. He requires something of lighter draught in place of the Trembler. Two smaller boats would be better. Have you any you can send me at once? Please answer.

WILLIAM L. JAMES,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

CITY POINT, VA., March 9, 1865.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. GORDON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Norfolk, Va.:

The necessities of the hospitals at City Point are such as to render it necessary to procure supplies of vegetables, fresh oysters, &c., for their use from the most available points. You will, therefore, permit such officers or agents as Colonel M. R. Morgan, chief commissary, may authorize and direct, to purchase for the commissary department, for the use of hospitals exclusively, such products as Norfolk may afford. This provision is designed purely for the benefit of hospitals, and is not intended to affect any regulation which you have made of the subject of trade further than herein expressed.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
