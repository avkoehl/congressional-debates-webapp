General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

GENERAL: Our reconnaissances thus far confirm the strength of the enemy's position. I am now satisfied that I was correct in my statement of his general position last night. Things are quiet to-day-but little firing; we remaining quiet in order not to draw attention to our reconnoitering parties. I see the secession colors as I write. It is clear that the enemy intend to fight us, and I think equally clear that we will be obliged to use our heavy artillery. The balloon has been of great service to-day. I am more and more satisfied that the services of the First Corps are necessary. I cannot dispense with Woodbury's Engineer Brigade.

The order in regard to new departments is received. I fear the movement it indicates of an advance on Richmond in two isolated columns is a mistake; it will probably enable the rebels to concentrate on one while he holds the other in check.

I will take Yorktown, but it may be a slow process.

Very respectfully, yours,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

LORENZO THOMAS,Adjutant-General:

I examined works on enemy's left very carefully to-day. They are very strong; the approaches difficult; enemy in force, and the water batteries at York and Gloucester said to be much increased. Have not seen them myself. Have not yet received reports of engineer officers. I go to-morrow to examine our left. Sharp firing on our right for some time to-day while I was there. No harm done, although their shells burst handsomely. Am receiving supplies from Ship Point, repairing roads, getting up siege guns, &amp;c. It seems now almost certain that we must use mortars and heavy guns freely before assaulting. The naval officers urge an attack on rear of Gloucester. I think they are right, but I am now too weak to attempt it unless new circumstances come to my knowledge. The affair will be protracted in consequence of the diminution of my forces.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

I received your note of 5 p.m. yesterday. The enemy, I find, is very strongly posted; but I am not yet certain of the extent of his works
