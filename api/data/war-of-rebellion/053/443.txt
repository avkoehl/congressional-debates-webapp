COLONEL: I have the honor to report all quiet here. The road over the mountain has been nearly impassable to-day, the mud being very sticky. I have kept a large detail at work, and have only succeeded in crossing twenty teams. There are thirty-eight wagons now parked at foot of mountain, which will cross to-morrow.
