EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Milledgeville, Ga., April 9, 1864.

THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA:

As a vast number of letters are being received at this department inquiring what civil and military officers of this State are exempt from Confederate conscription, which makes the labor of answering each burdensome, I adopt this mode of giving a general reply.

The Congress of the Confederate States, prior to the session of the General Assembly last winter, had by act left it to the Legislatures of the respective States to say what State officers should be exempt from conscription, and our Legislature passed the following joint resolution, which was approved December 14, 1863:

Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia in response to the law of the Confederate Congress inviting the several States to specify what State officers shall be exempt from conscription, That all civil and military officers of this State shall be so exempt.

The late act of Congress, known as the military act, exempts the members of the State Legislature and such other State officers as the Governors of the respective States may certify to be necessary for the proper administration of the State government.

In conformity to the resolution of the General Assembly, I have certified to the President that I claim as exempt all civil and military officers of this State. This embraces the judges of supreme court of this State and their clerk and deputy clerk, reporter and deputy reporter; all judges of the superior courts and one clerk and deputy clerk in each county, with one sheriff, one deputy sheriff, and one jailer for each county, with an additional deputy in each county embracing the larger cities, if the sheriff will file his affidavit that the services of such second deputy are actually necessary to enable him to discharge the duties of his office faithfully and promptly.
