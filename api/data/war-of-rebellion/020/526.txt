The most efficient workmen will be selected and placed in charge of forging the chain; some will be selected for making and sinking the cribs; others will be appointed to collect material. The iron will be obtained by Brigadier General A. R. Lawton in the best manner practicable.

SIR: To expedite the work of obstructing the channel near Forts Sumter and Moultrie it is a matter of the first necessity that every facility of railroad transportation for supplies of timber be furnished those having the work in charge. I therefore earnestly beg that every exertion be used on your part to assist in the rapid completion of this essential work. Mr. John Cheves, Mr. F. J. Porcher, and Captain F. D. Lee, Engineer Department, are authorized to call upon you for this object and to make all necessary arrangements.
