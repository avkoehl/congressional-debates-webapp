Lieutenant BURTON,

Signal Officer, Bridgeport:

Respectfully forwarded, with the request that General Reynolds' application may be granted.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Camp, Bolivar Springs, August 23, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Commanding Fourth Division:

Inclosed I have the honor to transmit copies of three telegrams sent you this day. I have no evidence that either one of the three has reached you-indeed I have but little confidence in the flag system at best. I also inclose you an order just received from department headquarters in regard to cutting down the banks and improving the crossings at the different fords on Battle Creek, and the construction of flat-boats. The general desires the work to be prosecuted as vigorously as possible.

Have applied for the cavalry you asked for, but have received no answer up to this time. You can use the pioneers to build the bridge, and also the flat-boats at Jasper. I do not know what the latter has reference to, as no order to build boats has been given from this office or passed through it, but give it to you as received by telegram from department headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. FLYNT,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Commanding Fourth Division:

Telegram in regard to cavalry received. The general suggests that you use the two companies detailed as couriers for that purpose instead of using your orderlies.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

GEO. E. FLYNT,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

[Inclosure Numbers 2]
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Camp, Bolivar Springs, August 23, 1863.

You are directed by the general commanding to supply Wilder's battery with such ammunition as he wants, and to make requisitions to supply yourself at this point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. FLYNT.

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
