By command of General Lee:

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CULPEPER, June 9, 1863.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Cooke had better be advanced to Hanover Junction, and Jenkins to the Chickahominy. Corse is ordered to join Pickett. Enemy crossed the Rappahannock at Beverly Ford-cavalry, infantry, and artillery-in large force this morning.

Prisoners from two corps have been captured this side of the river.

Two other corps are reported to be advancing north of the Rappahannock.

R. E. LEE.

[Indorsement.]

Referred to Adjutant and Inspector General for communication, as advised, to be made to General D. H. Hill in reference to Jenkins, and orders in relation to Cooke`s brigade.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, Va., June 9, 1863.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 3rd instant. * I have been under a misapprehension, if there was no force absorbed into General Pickett`s division, to supply, at least measurably, General [M.] Jenkins` brigade, left on the Blackwater. It was not, however, the whole or even larger part of the brigade, temporarily commanded by General [R. E.] Colston, for I was aware the regiments composing that, with the exception of one commanded, I believe, by Colonel [James] Giles, and returned to the command of General Samuel Jones. But previous to the arrival of those regiments from Western Virginia, there was some force, dignified with the name of a brigade, under the command of General Pryor, and that force, increased by Colonel Giles` regiment, was the brigade to which I had reference, and which I supposed had been substituted to General Jenkins. The distribution of the troops in North Carolina has, however, as you justly remark, been determined by the President, and I only make this explanation to account for the supposition I had entertained. These troops have, I suppose, been in some way incorporated in your army, or been assigned to other portions of General Hill`s command.

I have also received your letter, addressed to Governor Vance, of North Carolina, requesting his co-operation in recruiting the ranks
