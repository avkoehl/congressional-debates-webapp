DEAR COLONEL: I march in the morning. The infantry are to be at Fredericktown on Wednesday night, and I will be with the dragoons somewhere in the neighborhood of De Soto. I will burn and fight back towards Ironton, and, if fortune will only favor us, I hope to take Ironton on Sunday, the 20th instant. Please hurry up the horseshoes, and let me know what has been done towards my little cannot. I have ordered a permanent post line established between New Madrid and Bloomfield, and have made great and radical changes in the different organizations and departments. If I succeed in the adventure I will completely relieve General Price, or be near enough to operate with him.

Yours, &amp;c.,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
