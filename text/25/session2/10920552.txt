to the committee to mqui c concern ng him  
Ihe gentleman from Vermont [Mr S&adb] also objects to
the printing at this time, because, as he says, the people aie
now go much e%cut*d that they should not be trusted with the
proceedings, foi fiar they will do injustice to those who ire
implicated, and that our doings should not go abroad to the
people until we have finally determined the matter, W they
should, by their 'irennedute action, impioperiy m<iuepce our
decision
In my w 3men , t le commits ha?e proceeded regulprh,
withont violating any rule of this House, and their pioceed
mgs ought to be punted and examined by us, that the objec
tion raised against it is one of form merely, without any
ubstance, and that the peop i will, as we should do, look
beyond mere foims, and exi me into the substance of tins
question
Sir, thp people are not "finned into an improper excite

Let us look at the facts It w <• 1 «own to the members of
this House that one of om numoei had been killed in i duel
that he fell m combat witho v anothei membei, and that >thu

they had no light to make mj icpott upon it, that thty «hold 1

Ci^es a paper, dnwn up by the committee, condensing and

easily undeistood by the House, embodying with it the views
and reasons of the committee, and add in? thereto the letulution
or bill which they think too Hou&e ought to adopt All this i*
included m a repot of a committee, and unless all this m done,
(except wheie tht order of thelloo^e directs a mere leport
of facts,) the committee lads in its duty to theHoute What
should we say, in an oi dinar) tase, if a committct. cluuged to
investigate and iepoit, should only leturn the evidence in tht
precise form in which it had taken it, without any airatrtment
and without e^piessmg any opinion? Would wc not iv thty

Uevt that either of the membeis whose cond itt is under e\a
mi nation desires that these objections «hould be made or he
lievesthat they are calculated to sustain h s honor or his right*
The gentleman fiom ^ ermont [Mi Sr \db] admits that when
ordinary subjects of legislation are íeferred to a committee it
is proper foi the committee to report then opinions is well as
the facts, and yet he contends that in suth a case as this, they
had norifdit to take the evidence because it affects the uehts
and privileges of members of this House, and in this he is
more consistent than o'hers, who object to the printing, f\r<
if the rale prohibits the repoi ts, it al&o prohibit  the i?i%p<ttt
gatian by the committee, but, m my pidfment, both grounds
of objection are alike untenable If, however, the gentlemm
be right, then we should have a scale by which to gndune
our proceedings according to the supposed importance of the
subjects before us If the matter concerned our cone i uents
only we might refer it to a single member with ample poweis
to examine and report complete, and thus aave ourselves all
,r*ouhle ex( ept to pas1? upon it format?*/, by a third leading
and final vote, and tbrow off" upon the committee all the
respoepib i!Ly of tJocidng upon the merits And if the b'ibi
neea cofiearaed the nation at laige, or the officers cf the Go
veraraeat. we might enlarge the number  asd res ncf ihe
power* of our committees, according to the Increased impon
anee of the subjects presen'ed for action, untiitluy should
affect Qurselres and our privileges? and then we could so
p-oeacd as to preva    any acaon by committee at al , and it I
woulunot requiib much ingenuity on our part eflectually to
frustrate any attempt of the people to call u* to an account  In
deed, the gentleman from Vermont has contended that we had
no right toiaise a committee m such a case, and that ail the   I
pioceedmgs should be had at the bar of the House    Why did  J
he not go one step fuither, and insist that our privileges were
of such last importance, and our offices so sacred, that we were  |
bajond the power of the House to punish or expel, and that as  í
against us the Constitution has no power, that our right is a di
vine one, and tint our conduc   cannot be inquired into?   Sir,
this assumption might astonish our constituents somewhat, and
for a time excite them, but perhapsa speech in favor of it would
' set u-s right with them,' it would, to be sure, make the Con
eti ution a dead letter, but it would guard our privileges1   And
it would not be moie inconsistent than that a committee cannot
piqimmaiiiy examine our conduct, for the i ule from the Ma-
nuilexpie^sly recognises the right of the House to authon/ea
committee to tnqune into the conduct of membcis
Othei men beib, who ate opposed to punting even the evi

The committee weie not onl> bound b> the resohit on toie

iiamps \ eie stated) should be tried and expelled, and ntheis
prayed for the pipage of laws fo pre\ent duelhnff All these
petitions wue referred to that comni tee and, therefore, if
theie h id been no previous resolution the refeitncpot these
petitions lequned the committee to investigate the charges
contained m them to examine into the conduct of the mem
bers ice jsed and to rpport thereon to the Hoiibc Did not the
retire ice of the=e petitions confer special author! > on the
committee'* Why,if you did not expect action upon them, did
you act the solemn farce of refernng them, and thus deceive
the people into the belief that vou did intend to act for the
maintenance of the honor of your body? If the object r not
decern e, why is it (and our constituents will ask why it is)
that, after referí mg these petitioi s to the committee weicfu=e
to leceive then repoit and to act thereon*1 Why dd wt not
flankly tell the petiu ners then that we did no* intend, bv the
reference to produce any action upoa their rnemor als? Why
n- t tell them we pent the petitions 'o that committee fm the
purpose of putting thtm to sleep9 Sn, we thfn intended to act
fully ind fearlessly iq on this snujec and had the committee
merelj presented the evidence thev would have deserved the
censure of the Hou*¡e and, I have no doubt, would have re
ceivedit
In the case of John Smith, a Senator fiom Ohio, who was
proceeded against by th" Senate upon a charge of being en
gifrea in Burr's conspiracy, the select committee reported to
the Senate all the testim nvy taken befoie them, with an elabo
rate report embracing the reasons or arguments of the com
rmttee citing precede is and giving the conclusions of the
committee, together with a resolution directing that he be ex
pelted from tht Senate The revoluti m po introduced was the
subject of conoideration before the Senate down to the time of
he final decision of the case and the estimony, report, and
reso'micn, wera printed by order of the Senate
In that rait Smith was allowed to gwe additional testimony
¡n 1 ** defence at the bar of the Senate and that body acted
ii pon the u stimony so given befoi e the committee ?nd at the bar
 o,sii3tkSt*ase,iftriepaff^,pcfeii^ed can produce additional
I evidence m their behalf, I doubt not the House willgivethem
perm •« ion to do so, either befoie the committee or at the bar
as thev shall desire The proceedings, thus far, are prelum
nary to the final tnal, and, like any other similar step, do not
j    preclude the House from acting as it shall deem light    If we
| are su.ti fied that the committee have not obrair ed all the facta
necessary to a correct decision, we can «supply the defect
J There is no good reason why the reports m this caseshould be
opprt^ed, none why they should not be printed, like any
other proceeding of a committee which relates solely to the
rights of the peop'e The honor of the House neither de-
mane , nor will it permit, any such dibtmctton at ourhands
Our c instituents and ourselves should be treated alike by this
body, and theie is no danger that our fellow members wiilsuf
fer n justice from us The danger is that offending members
are more likely tobe screened from punishment when deserved,
than that they will smler when innocent Oui social relations
with eich other the intimacy and personal friendship existing,
air-on  members of the same body, and the lact that our rights,
privih oesj an 1 duties are identical, will, at all times, prevent in-
justice being done them 1 insist, therefore, that, by the reso-
lution and petitions refened to the committee, they were
bound to go as far as they had gone, and we required It at
their hands, and I have no doubt they have performed the trust
impa illy But whether they have come to a conclusion
warrat ted by the evidenct we can better determine when we
nave (xammed the whole ca^e
Why I repeat, sir should we pursue a dnTerentcoursemthe
case of our members fiom what we do in that of our constitu-
ents? Aie we sent here to mteiposc obstacles for our defence,
when the people call foi an mqutrv into our conduct? What
reason is there that ire, the servants oí the people, should at-
tempt to sheltei each other behind foims, wl en they demand
the investigation^ We are a'ready enough protected, without
seizing upon technicalities to defend ourselves We, unlike
other i filcers of the Government, are held notto be liable to im-
peachment for om oflicul misconduct, and theie is no way of
remowq- us from ornee, how ever flagrant our offences, except
by such i proceedi ig as this And what will our constituents
think vf usjif they find us engase ' in hunting up objections to
evade this inquiry upon its merits' Sir, let us meet it fairly and
fully,    nd decide it m the face of the countrv
Ihee ntleman fiom Vermont f Mr ¡Sr adb] charges the object
ofthosi in favoi ol piinnng to be to place tho report in the
hands cf the people to excite them to demand the expulsion of
members and for the pm pose of preventing the re election of
any ow who may be expelled In this he mistakes the true
point, and I thiok, improperly impeaches the motives of those
who dií u with him The piopositton is to print the usual
number fo the use of4% sllouse, and without which it will bfi
veiy dití cult, if not impossible, for us properly to examine and
decide tl ( case, and such is the object of punting I admit,
howevei that & consequence will be that tie report and test!
monv w, nld go bef )re thp people and if it t'ces so, I have no
doubt it w ill make the pioper, ant* no othei, ímj ression upon
the publ t mind I do not believe that if will impioperiy affect
tlie char ctpr and «tipdingofanv membei of this House
The p( pie are not likely to do injustice to their public ser
vants, a difpeichince, thioneh theinfiuence ofamomentary
excitemuit, tney imbibe impiopei prejudice  pgamst them,
they are <-me in the end to ste their error md the sympathy
which it c i tdtes will lead them t) atone for the momentary pain
inflicted 1    doing them even moie than justice
Sir, no np aufleis peí manent injustice, whether in regard to
luo motive**, or hi&conduct, fiom hi  constituents
Gentlemen are willing to let the people see the iepoit and
testimony hereaftet "when they shall have got over their ex-
citement ti nd become calm, ' ' when we have decided the case '*
And they ask, why pub i=h the pioteedings«oí¿, inasmuch as
the people uefiottotiA the uu«e and when perhaps only a
partofthe evidence bambeen gnen? It is true that the people
are not to tiy the question, hut they have the same light to see
and examine our proceedings in regard to th s, as on any other
subject which comes befoie us It wil' not doto tell them that
this questst i is abo\ c then capacity to examine full} that they
will be liktjv odo injustice to members of this body, nor will
they be sa fied with oui lefusat, because «iZ the e N'idenee may
Hot have b   o sriven
I conten i *ír Speakei that the rule alluded to from the
Manual w i ot intended to apply to such a case a  this It
was intend 1 o prevent a committee, of then own accord, and
without th nowledge of the House, fiom tr}iijga member,
without gn ¡i s him an opportunity to be heard It was to pro-
tect raembfi against seoiet and expat I* invebtigations of their
conduct by 0( mmittees but was not designed to shield them
from a full <md free examination into their con luct whenever
the House 1 <=■ n ves it ntcc^eai y to entiust a committee with that
duty Nov ir I ask again tlidnot the House intend—when it
adopted the n =< >lution of inquiry, and when it referred the peti-
tions to the if imittee—to have an examination into the con*
duct of the \ v members who are implicated by the report?
And was it no' well known, for two months that the committee
was investiga ins the conduct of those members'? And havewe
not known thi t hose membeis were daily before the commit
tee, producme testimony, and examining and cross examining
the witnesses^ If, aftei all this we refuse to receive and print
the reports, w e shall show that we are more intent on pursuing
forms than of administering impartial ju3tice, that we care
more for techi cahties than foi the honor of tlie House
Sir, our cons i uents will understand this case, and it will be
m vain for us n ittempt to deceue them They will look us
steadily in the * ice, and v ill caiefullv watch our movements in
this, one of the lost important investigations which can come
before us and i we endea\ or to e\ ade their gaze bv the gauze
veil of subtle) i nements, they will look through it or tear it
from us, and w e  • hall at last find ourselves exposed to their just
indignation
For one, I di =• e to see ill that the committee have done, to
examine it debí frately, and to hear such ftiiiher evidence's 
shall be offered m order tnat I may come to such conclusion
as will protect dip privileges of tins House and its members,
and at the same time do no injustice to individuals
