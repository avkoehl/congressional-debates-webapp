Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Four deserters received to-day represent Ransom's and Gracie's brigades, of Johnson's division, and Cooke's and Archer's brigades, of Heth's division. The position of their brigades is shown on the returned map. Tow regiments of Wise's brigade are detailed for building two forts in the rear of Ransom's brigade, on which they are at work at present. All the brigades are located on the returned map with considerable exactness, excepting, perhaps, the brigades of Davis, MacRae, and Lane. They are, however, approximately located. No reliable news from Whiting's division. It cannot have arrived in this vicinity without some definite information concerning it by this time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
