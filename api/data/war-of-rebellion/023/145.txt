At all events communicate with both instantly. Take your position promptly and you are amply able to do what you like. Keep the enemy out of Shelbyville if you can, but that is not the place for you to make your stand.

COMMANDING OFFICER:

Forward this to General Smith by special train or otherwise without a moment's delay.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 14, 1862.

General SMITH, Cowan, or on the road:

The troops at Murfreesborough surrendered at 4 p.m. yesterday. One of the plans of the enemy and, I think the most probable, will be to sweep down the railroad. Make your dispositions accordingly. Those here indicated must vary according to circumstances. Leave a force of two regiments at least about Dechered, and push forward two regiments by cars to Duck River. The bulk of the force at Tullahoma to go to the same point. The force at Wartrace to fall back to that point if in danger. If the enemy should have made too great progress it may be necessary to make your stand this side of Duck River, but it is of great importance to save that bridge. See that you bridges are guarded, and send your trains back the moment you can unload them, so as to run no risk. Wood is marching on Fayetteville. Troops will reach there to-night. I calculate on getting supplies to you, but if not you must by some means live. Pay for what you take. Economize to the last degree. There are in all about ten regiments on your lines, including Walker's and Matthews'. The latter is probably at Wartrace. If you should fail and Duck River, which I do not at all apprehend, Elk River is the next most important point.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 14, 1862.

Colonel SWORDS, Louisville:

It is reported to me that there are no supplies at Nashville and that none have been received for six days. What does it mean? This army cannot be maintained in this way.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 14, 1862.

General THOMAS, Tuscumbia:

As you may have to cross the river any day you had better look well to the means. You can cross best at Florence, and the road on this side is excellent. The two scows which we used should be kept ready and the little steamer ought not to be caught by low water bellow the Shoals. You could cross as well at Eastport by the same means, but it would increase your march six days, which ought to be avoided even if time should not be important. Keep your hospitals as clear as possible.
