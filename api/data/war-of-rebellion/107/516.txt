Captain G. L. HARTSUFF, Wheeling, Va.:

Your dispatch received. Telegraph General Kelley to put everything in order. Open prompt communication with Thirteenth Indiana. Direct them to scout to Fifteen-Mile Creek. Why can't that point be occupied to cut off Jackson? Send the Seventh to Springfield with everything needful for their comfort. Banks will re-enforce Lander, and I want full, early information of front toward Bloomery Gap.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

General N. P. BANKS:

Send to General Lander strong re-enforcements, supplies, &amp;c., as rapidly as possible. Should the enemy cross the river use your best endeavors to cut him off. In case the operations at Hancock assume large proportions the general commanding desires you to repair thither and assume the command in person.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
