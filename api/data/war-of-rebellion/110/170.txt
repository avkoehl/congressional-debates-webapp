Richmond, October 9, 1861.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector-General, Confederate States:

GENERAL: In relation to the communicaiton of General A. S. Johnston, dated October 4, 1861* (herewith returned), relative to the product of the powder mills near Nashville, I have to say that these mills are at present supplied in a great measure with materials furnished by the Confederate States through this Bureau. While, therefore, it is entirely proper that General Johnston's most pressing wants should be first provided for, I deem it but the province of this Bureau to give such directions to the ordnance officer at Nashville as will secure some degree of equality in the distribution of the powder after a due supply to General Johnston's command. The order to divert powder from the mills to New Orleans and Mobile was conditional and dependent on the supply. Directions will be given to Lieutenant Wright not to send away powder until some adequate supply is obtained for the wants of the Upper Mississippi.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. GORGAS,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Ordnance.
