GENERAL McCOOK'S HEADQUARTERS, September 22, 1863-11 a.m.

Colonel POST:

General McCook directs me to say to you, hold the enemy in front of you in check if you can, but do not permit them to get in your rear or press you too hard. Retire on the main road, and your crossing the bridge will be covered by this troops and artillery. I think there are now some stragglers (cavalry, perhaps) in your rear. As soon as you retire and cross the bridge you will rejoin your division, which is on the right of my line.

Respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. THIRD BRIG., THIRD DIV., RESERVE CORPS,On First Bench of Lookout Mountain Point, September 22, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: The enemy attacked us to-day at 12.30 with four regiments (infantry and artillery). My forces fought well and never yielded the ground until they were overpowered and compelled to fall back, which was done in good order, and we now have our position on the first bench of the mountain. The enemy seems to be reluctant in advancing. I have several men killed and many wounded.

I will contest it, according to your order this day, inch by inch and foot by foot.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES G. SPEARS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I am informed the enemy is endeavoring to flank me across the mountain below; whether true or not I am unable to state. The enemy holds the position I occupied this morning.
