THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
im
of sending the Ml to the select committee of
twenty-six, as proposed by Mr. Williams.
Mi CASEY said he had not been able to hear
all the remarks of the gentleman from Kentucky,
[Mi MLNLrEE,] but from the whole tenor of the
debate, it was odvious that the object of the mo-
tion to refer this bill to the select committee was
ti defeat the passage of this bill at this session
This was a measure of deep interest to the new
States, and indeed to the whole western country
It was a subject that legitimately belonged to the
Committee on Public Lands, one that had here-
tofore received the attention of that committee,
and if it was the intention of the House to act on
the subject at this session, it should go to that
committee
As to the select committee raised on the special
message of the Commissioner of the Geneial
Land Office, m answer to the resolution of this
House, in relation to the division of the public
lands among the old States of the Union, he
thought, with all due deference to that committee,
that if they would attend to the arduous duties
devolving on them, they would have enough to
do He repeated, he was in favor of the bill, and
should therefore insist on his motion to refer it to
the Committee on Public Lands
The first motion was further advocated by
Messrs SHIELDS, HAYNLS, PARKER,
BOON, and MARTIN, and opposed by Messrs
MENEFEE, ROBERTSON, and WILLIAMS
of North Caiolma, when
Mr HOWARD demanded the ptevious ques-
tion, but withdrew it at the request of Mr JOHN
SON, of Maryland, who, after a few words m
behalf of the motion of Mr Williams, renewed
it
The SPEAKER, in answei to Mr Everett,
stated that the main question would be on the
engrossment of the bill, whereupon
Mi JOHNSON withdrew the demand foi the
previous question, and the question of reference
wasfuithcr debated in opposition to the first mo-
tion by Mi LINCOLN, and in support by
Messrs EWING, CUSHING, and SHIELDS,
Mr MONTGOMERY was opposed to refer
-mg thebilltoeithereommittee, though,if it went
to eithei, it should be to that of twenty six He
*as also opposed to discussing the refeience of a
bill winch, in his opinion, ought never to pass,
and, theiefoie, in order to test the question on its
passage, he moved to lay the bill on the table,
and demanded the yeas and nays, which were
ordeied
Mi BOON moved a call of the House, which
aas oidered, and proceeded in till one hundred
and fifty seven members had answeied to their
lames, when the absentees were called, and sev-
eral having answered, one hundred and seventy-
one weie found to be piesent
Mi MURRAY moved to dispense with the
further proceedings of the call, but the motion
was disagreed to
The doors were then closed, and the absentees
again called over, when excuses were rendered
for several of the members.
Mi THOMPSON made another ineffectual mo-
tion to dispense with the call
Mr T then moved the enfoicement of the bal
anee of the 57th rule, to send special messengers
for the absentees not excused, and take them mto
custody
Mr CASEY notified the House that there were
a number of members in attendance outside the
Hall, and he moved that the doors be opened foi
their admission, which motion was lost
Mr GRENNELL suggested that the Speaker
send messengers to the absentees to íequest their
attendance, but it was objected to
The question on executing the 57th rule was
then decided in the negative—ayes 65, noes 69
Mr SIBLEY then moved to dispense with the
call
Mr THOMPSON asked for the yeas and nays,
but they were refused
The call was then dispensed with—ayes eighty,
noes not counted
The doors were then opened, and a numbei of
members came in
Mr SAWYER moved that the House adjourn
Mi GARLAND, of Louisiana, demanded the
yeas and nays, and they were ordeied
Mr  SAWYER withdrew his motion
The question was then taken on laying the
graduation bill on the table, and decided in the
affirmative—yeas 102, nays 97, as follows
