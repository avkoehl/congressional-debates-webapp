ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE,

New Orleans, La. September 22, 1865.

Bvt. Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In compliance with General Orders, Numbers 39, from your office, dated July 1, 1865, I have the honor to submit herewith my annual report for the year ending June 30, 1865.

My last annual report was mailed on the 15th of September, 1864, and at the date of its close I was in charge of the depot of repairs and wagon transportation for the Army of the Potomac, located at City Point, Va. By Special Orders, Numbers 78, headquarters Armies of the United States, dated August 23, 1864, I was directed to report to Brigadier General Ingalls, chief quartermaster Armies operating against Richmond, and my duties increased by the addition of the Army of the James, for which, with the Army of the Potomac, I furnished the means of transportation, as well as the repairs of wagons, ambulances, &amp;c.

My duties during the year have consisted in the receipt and issue of animals, wagons, harness, &c.; the general repairs of all means of transportation, including shipping; furnishing transportation for all extra work, such as hauling guns, ammunition, &c.; for siege artillery, railroad ties and material for construction corps, lumber, logs for stockades, fuel, &c., for the depot field hospitals; medical, subsistence, ordnance, and quartermaster's stores, to different points of the army; policing purposes at the hospitals and depot, and all details where troops or temporary commands were without the necessary transportation; also the construction and repairs of the public buildings, wharves, stables, &c., at the depot. No moves of the depot were made during the year, notwithstanding at times the greater part of the employes were doing service at other points.

My force of employes at the beginning of the year numbered as follows, viz:

Wheelwrights........................................ 115

Carpenters.......................................... 18

Laborers............................................ 291

Blacksmiths......................................... 89

Saddle........................sters.............. ............................. 381

Clerks, superintendents, wagon-masters, &c.......... 70

Total............................................... 987

Together with 273 six-mule teams, 69 four horse and mule teams, 20 two-horse teams, 31 two-horse ambulance teams; the number of animals in the corrals for receiving and issuing purposes, 351; making a total of 575 horses and 1,792 mules, or 2,367 animals.

It was found that this force of mechanical labor and the number of teams were totally inadequate to meet the requirements of the service. I was accordingly directed by General Ingalls to increase my force and extend the operations of my depot until I could meet and supply every want promptly. For this purpose I caused advertisements to be inserted in some of the authorized newspapers of the Northern towns for mechanics and teamsters, and sent agents to secure the men, and also went myself, by order of General Grant, for
