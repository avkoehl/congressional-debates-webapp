U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHER VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

GENERAL: I received your letter of this date containing the terms of surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as propose by you. As they substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the 8th instant, they are accepted. I will proceed to designate the proper officers to carry the stipulations into effect.

R. E. LEE,General.

C., in obedience to your orders. Notice was at once given by him to General Johnston for the termination of the truce that had been entered into. On the 25th another meeting between them was agreed upon, to take place on the 26th, which terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston's army upon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee.=

The expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got off on the 20th of March, moving by way of Boone, N. C., and struck the railroad at Wytheville, Chambersburg, and Big Lick.
