HDQRS. INDPT. BATTERY E, PENNSYLVANIA ARTY.,Near Goldsborough, March 25, 1865

LIEUTENANT; I have the honor to report the following operations of this battery during the campaign just ended:

Battery left Savannah, Ga., January 27, marching with Second Division on road toward Augusta; arrived at Sister's Ferry January 29, and remained in camp until February 4, awaiting the completion of the bridge over the Savannah River.

Crossed the river on morning of February 4, and marched via Robertsville, Lawtonville, and Duck Branch Post-Office, joining the other divisions of the corps on the 10th at Blackville, on Central [South Carolina] Railroad. Continued our march over South and North Forks of Edisto, crossing Saluda River six miles above Columbia on the 18th and Broad River on the 20th. Encamped at Winnsborough on the 21st. Crossed Catawba River on the 23rd on took the road via Hanging Rock to Chesterfield Court-House, where we arrived on March 2.

Our march was continued over Pedee River at Cheraw, and thence to Fayetteville, where we encamped on the evening of the 11th. Had one man wounded on the 11th while out with foraging party near Fayetteville. Marched from Fayetteville with Second Division on the 15th in charge of corps wagon train. Six men of the battery were captured by the enemy on the 16th while out with foraging detail of Second Division. Rejoined the corps on morning of March 20, but too late to take any part in the action. Marched thence on the 22nd and arrived at Goldsborough on the 24th.

No ammunition was expended by the battery during the campaign. On the march both men and animals have been subsisted off the country. We have consumed in all 75,000 pounds of corn and 50,000 pounds of fodder. The men have consumed about 4,000 pounds of flour 2,000 pounds of corn meal, and 2,000 pounds of potatoes, with probably 5,000 pounds of ham or bacon and 3,000 pounds of fresh meat. But few animals were captured and those mostly of an inferior kind. Ten horses and fifteen mules sum up the number taken by this command, and the same amount was turned over to quartermaster's department from our worn out stock.

Recapitulation: John Drew, wounded March 11; William C. Taylor, W. R. Canham, Samuel Cowley, Wellington Stewart, James D. Walker, and Robert McChesney, captured March 16. Horses taken, 10; mules taken, 15.
