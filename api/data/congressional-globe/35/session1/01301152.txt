EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Sen-
ate a report of the Secretary of War, commu-
nicating, in compliance with resolutions of the
Senate of February 15 and March 8, a copy of
Captain T. J. Cram's military and topographical
memoir, report, and maps, on the department of
the Pacific, together with a letter from the Hon.
I I. Stevens and a report of Captain A. A. Hum-
phrey on the character of that memoir; which,
on- motion of Mr. Bjoler, was referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs and Militia.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair has re-
ceived a memorial from the members and officers
of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of
Utah, addressed to the Congress of the United
States, in which they set forth their grievances,
and desire the withdrawal of the troops of the
United States from the Teriitory.
Mr. STUART. I suppose it is hardly neces-
sary to read that document. I move its reference
to the Committee on Territories. -
Mr. HAMLIN. It should go to the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs.
Mr. KING. Had it not better be printed ?
Mr. HOUSTON. Let us have it read.
Mr. STUART. I think it should go to the
Committee on Territories, although it asks for a
withdrawal of^the troops. It is a statement of
the interna! affairs of the Territory, if it is any-
thing. I think it ought to be printed, but it cer-
tainly ought to go to the Committee on Territo-
ries.
Mr. BIGLER. I think it ought to be printed.
The motion to print was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Unless some mo-
tion to a different effeci be made, it will berefeired
to the Committee on Territories.
It was so referred.
Mr. BIGLER, I have been requested to pre-
sent to the Senate the memorial of James C.
Chisty, Edward Wickersham, William M. Arm-
strong, C. McAllister, and others, citizens of the
city of Philadelphia, who are creditors of the
State of Texas. The memorialists express their
surprise that the Legislature of Texas should
have passed resolutions claiming for the State of
Texas the balance of the appropriation now in
the Treasury, made on the 28th day of February,
1855, for the creditors of that State. They re-
monstrate against the purpose of that resolution.
They claim the balance of that appropriation for
the benefit of the creditors, and pray Congress to
pass a law authorizing the Secretary of the Treas-
ury to distribute the balance now remaining in
the Treasury among the creditors who have filed
their claims in pursuance of law. I ask its refer-
ence to the Committee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SEWARD presented the petition of Eliza
E. Ogden, praying to be allowed a commission

band, Major Edmund A. Ogden, while acting as
assistant quartermaster in the Army; which was

rence Kearny, a captain in the United States Na-
