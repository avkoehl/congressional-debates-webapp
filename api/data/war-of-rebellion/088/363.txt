HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 21, 1864-12 m.

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

With the enemy's intrenchments held with as thin a line as he now hold's it, Mott's division need only hold the front line of works thinly and the large redoubt on the plank road, so as to leave every man possible available for the left. The commanding general thinks that in the present almost impassable condition of the roads it is advisable not to take your artillery beyond the plank road.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S.-General Ord will send from 500 to 800 men to relieve that many of Mott's. Please give directions accordingly, and let Mott communicate to General Ord where the troops can best get into the intrenchments.
