Major-General ROSECRANS:

Report of enemy at Hermann confirmed. No further particulars learned.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 4,1 864-2.50 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

The rebels are on the road between me and Saint Louis and have cut off all communication. They attacked Hermann last evening and had three pieces of artillery. They have captured railroad train and three locomotives. It is said that they also captured four steam ferry-boats. If you support me it must be by direct movement down the river as quickly as possible. Am doing all I can to be ready to defend the place, but the situation is bad. I want infantry and artillery. The rebels have a large force. They captured four guns from Ewing, and from last accounts nearly his entire command. The appearances are that the enemy are moving up the river.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 4, 1864.

(Received 5 p. m.)

General E. B. BROWN:

Price should be checked at the Gasconade River. Bridges and boats on Gasconade and Osage should be beyond all possible use to him. Destroying an eastern span of railroad bridge may be necessary. River too low and boats too scarce for my movements; rains will raise streams, and Price must be captured. Do not allow your forces to be captured; if too small batter fall back, but stand as long as you can safely.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 4, 1864-3.55 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

The enemy have not made their appearance to the west of the Gasconade in the country toward Vienna. They seem to have possession of all the country east of Hermann. General Fisk's command is moving to my support. When it arrives I shall have 6,000 men and eight small pieces of artillery. The situation is worse than when I was at Springfield.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 4, 1864.

General BROWN,

Jefferson City:

If bridges over Gasconade are destroyed Price will not cross. Heavy rains past two days will raise stream and obstruct passage. Pressed
