INTERSECTION IRWIN'S AND WALKER'S FORD ROADS, December 2, 1863-1 p.m.

A messenger who left Walker's Ford 12 o'clock brings word from one of my staff officers at the ford that Colonel Graham is skirmishing with enemy about 2 miles from the ford and is falling back gradually. Colonel Jackson is at the ford. This point is 5 miles from the ford, and I have sent word to Jackson to see if he needs re-enforcements. Part of the brigade of reserve with the battery took the middle road instead of the Irwin Ford road, and I am waiting to hear from Jackson before concentrating at this point.

It may be that the troops on the other road will be needed at the ford; if so, they will have a better road than from here. If you decide to send a regiment of cavalry to re-enforce Graham, Colonel Foster is at Tazewell, and you can communicate directly with him.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General FOSTER.

INTERSECTION WALKER'S AND IRWIN'S FORD ROADS, December 2, 1863-1.30 p.m.

Understanding that Jackson is crossing part of his infantry over the river, I have ordered Colonel Curtin to the ford, with two regiments and the remaining battery, leaving one regiment here with Colonel Mahan. I shall now proceed at once to Walker's Ford. I understand that Colonel Graham feels no uneasiness about his ability to withdraw, that he is falling back slowly, and that the main body of the enemy is on other side of the mountain.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Maj. Gen. JOHN G. FOSTER, Tazewell.

WALKER'S FORD, December 2, 1863-5 p.m.

After quite a struggle to-day, our troops remain in possession of Walker's Ford. A regiment of infantry held the road on the opposite side of the river until toward dusk. The enemy withdrew after in vain having attempted to force our infantry line. They seemed to draw off both to their left and right. There are only two companies picketing Needham's Ford.

Colonel Graham's brigade expended all their ammunition, and will require to be replenished by morning. Colonel Jackson lost about 10 killed and 20 wounded, and Colonel Graham's loss will not exceed 25 or 30.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Maj. Gen. JOHN G. FOSTER, Tazewell.
