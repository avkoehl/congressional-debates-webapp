Graduation Bill—Mr. Benton.
the most seductive character; they were calculated
to seduce all unreflecting minds, for they proposed
a distribution among the people  f"near sixty or
seventy millionsofdollars, Thedistribuiion would
have left the Treasury -bare; would have bank-
rupted the deposit banks; might have debauched
the States-, would have compelled a resort-to loans
or a- new tariff; and would have set the fatal ex-
ample of lavishing the public money and the pub-
lic property upon the people on the eve of the
presidential elections. The first bill passed the
two Houses in 1832, just, before the presidential
election, and so near the end of the session of
Congress that the President had but a few hours,
instead of the ten days which the Constitution al-
lowed him,to examine its provisions, to make up
his mind upon it, and to return it to the Senate
•with his, objections in writing, if disapproved by
him. It was retained by him the ten days, as he
had a clear constitutional right to do; Congress
did not think proper to prolong its session to
cover those ten days, as it might have done; for
it was the session whose duration was not limited
by the Constitution; and the two Houses having
adjourned; he retained the bill until the next ses-
sion, and then returned it to the House in which
it originated witfhi his: objections -to it. This "was
thé regola* course-prescribed by the Constitution,
and,- thanks to' the spirit' and intelligence!of the
Eeople,'it was the coursejjanctioned and approved
y them'. Instead of being excited against the
patriot.President by an affected outcry against
'"pocketing Oils," and by a per capita calculation
of the "money each voter had lost, so ostentatiously
paraded before their eyes; instead of being excited
against General Jackson by those means, and
made to cast their votes against him, the high-
minded people of our America approved his con-
duct, and testified their approbation in the dis-
tinguished honorof his second election. This was
the fate of the first bill. It was to have taken the
whole proceeds of the sales of the public lands for
five years—the years 1833-'34-'35-'36-'37—and
divided them among the States, leaving the Treas-
ury entirely dependent upon the custom-house
duyes for its supporvwhdeh many then saw, and
experience has since proved, "would be* wholly
inadequate, without a resort to a new tariff, loans,
or Treasury notes' to defray the ordinary expenses
of the Government!     *•    -
The second bill was a duplicate of. the first, hut
four years its junior in point of time: it did not
come on until the approach of the presidential
election in 1836, but was made to cover the same
number of years, and the same identical years,
which were oovered by the first one. To do this,
it was necessary to make this second bill retroact—
make it teach back, and exact from the Treasury
as much money as.the first bill would have taken
out of it tip to that time, and then for as many
more years as would complete the original five.
In fact, it was the same bill in «every ¡particular,
with the fiaperaddition of tire signaiaggravation of
being retroactive, and getting hold of three -years'
revenue from the lends for a grand distribution-on
the eve of the approaching -presidential election.
This was the character of the second bill; and this
character is too important and too necessary to be
understood by the people, for- their knowledge of
it to rest upon description. They must see it!
They must see the thing-itself, and know of their
own- knowledge what it was that fell—for fall it
did—before the stern resolve of General Jackson;
and thetossof which is now deplored as a national
Calamityt- The people must see it; and here it.is
in the book of the bills of the Senate, which I
have this m'ojhent sent a messenger to bring me
fwMi the office of the Secretary. It is entitled,
'^'An act-to divide among the States, for a limited
time, thepi-oceeds ofthe salesfof thepublic lands,"
&c.*;wnd the signature of the then Secretary of the
Senate, WaltefiiOwiie, Esq., attests that it passed
this'body on the 12th day of May, 1836. Í read
from the third and fourth sections, which show
the parts which are material to the present inquiry.
- "Sec. 3. rfnd ire it further enacted, That the
' several surBS*f money received in the Treasary
' as the net proceeds of the sales of the public
«lands for the /ears eighteen boadred arití'thirty-
«three, eighteen hundred and' thirty-four, and
* eighteen hundred and thirty-five,, shall fee paid
' and- distributed as aforssaid,at the Treasury of
1 the United States, one fourth part on the firstday
',of July eighteen hundred and thirty-six, and one
'.fourth part at the end of each ninety days there-
' after, until the whole is paid; and those which
; shall be received for the years eighteen hundred
' and thirty-six and eighteen hundred and. thirty-
' seven, shall also be paid at the Treasury half
' yearly, on ttíefirst day of July and January, in
' each of those years, to such person or persons
' as the respective Legislatures of the said States
' shall authorize and direct to receive the same.
" Sec. 4. And be itfurthtr enacted, That this act
' shall continueand be in force until the thirty-first
' day of December, one thousand eight hundred
' and thirty-seven, unless the United States shall
' become involved in war with any foreign power,
' in .which event, from the commencement of hos-
' tilities, this act shall cease, and be no longer in
•force."
These are the sections of the actof 1836—-the
act which sunk before the firm resolve of Presi-
dent Jackson—sunk.before his resolve! for it died
under his known opinion in respect to it, and
without having reached his.hand.■ It was the
copy of the one which- he had retained^ and which
he had returned with his objections. ..It was
known, to be useless to send it to hira,Mnless-,there
was a majority of two th irds for it io each- House.
Such a majority, could; not be conciliated; and the
bill, after becoming an actiof the Senate,.died out
in the House of Representatives, and was suc-
ceeded by another act in .the Senate to accomplish
a part of its purpose; namely, the bill to dis-
tribute, under the name of a deposit, $36,000,000
of public moneys among the States. This latter
became -a law; it was only about one half the
magnitude of its predecessor and. progenitor—the
five years' land revenue,distribution bill. It was
only half the magnitude of that bill; but the one
half of it, even, was enough to crush the great
deposit banks; •
I was one of a few who opposed all three of
these bills; and especially 1 opposed the one from
which two sections have just been read,, and for
theiossof which General Jackson has --been so
incontinently denounced on this floor, and for the
want of which so many evils have been asserted
to have arisen. I join issue upon these assertions.
I denoancelhis bill now, as I did when it was oil
its.passage^ as a bill that would have bankrupted
the deposit banks,-and bankrupted the Treasury,
and laid the-Government under the necessity of
reviving the tariff, or borrowing money to defray
its ordinary daily and current expenses. , These j
were my declarations then, when the bill was on
its passage-in May, 1836; and I expressed myself [
with such earnestness with respect to the danger
to the banks and the Treasury, that a member of
the Seriate and a friend .now present, suggested
that they would alarm the.country, if published
as-delivered; and, in consequence, the speech was
but partially and imperfectly reported. The bill
died in the House of Representatives; it never
became a law. I was satisfied, and should never
have troubled the Senate and the country with a
revival of the subject, had it not been now revived
by the author of the bill, for the purpose of at-
tributing to it a vast merit, and for the purpose of
reiterating upon General Jackson an oft-repeated
denunciation. The defunct bill is resuscitated by
its author—resuscitated, to claim our sympathies,
as a measure of beneficence to the country, and
to excite our resentment againfet General Jackson,
-as the destroyer of so fine a measure. Revived,
resuscitated, dug up from its grave in this man-
ner, and for these purposes, it becomes a legiti-
mate subject for parliamentary animadversion;
and.tmean to advert upon it freely, closely, and
truly, that the country may not Only see what it
is they are called upon to regret, and to censure
Gerieral Jackson for destroying, butalso to enable
all men who are of " sound mind and •memory"; to
judge for themselves what this country would
come to if its destinies were in the hands of the
friends and supporters of such a bill. .
1 now-address myself to the candar and.-intelli-
gence of all parties, in this Chasnber!aad out ¿fit,
and invoke their attention, and that-decision of
their minds,«n the case which, will be presented.
The bill,in its third section, provides, first, for the
distribution of the money -which .had-been. received
from the sales of the public land's-for. th*,t¿«ee
preceding,years,,and which moneyhad already,
in, great part,, been expended by the, Government'!
It,ordered the amounts received from the lands in
the years l833-'34, and '35,. to be divided outs
the, division to commence,on the 1st d&y-af July
next ensuing, and to be accomplished. in four
installments, at ninety, days apart. This -was
one clause of the bill,.and the amount on which if
would have operated was $23,582,882; tb'at is to
say, the sum of P.967.6S2 for 1833; the ,sum .of
$4,857,600.for 1834; and the sum of $14*757,48 
for! 1835. This- would have made, the sum of
nearly46,000,000,in round numbers, payable oil*
of the Treasury at intervals of ninety, days, to
.wit: on the Ist.days of July, October, January,
and Ap.nl. The whole sum of $23,500,090 wouli
have been payable in the short- space of about niflfc
months, and that in addition to §31,GOO¿000 which
would be required for the service of the Govern-
ment during the same year. So much far one
branch of the distribution clause. The second
branch of it ordered the proceeds of th*. land sajes
for the years; 1836 and-1837 to be also divided.oaíí
but by.-a;half-yearly instead of qsarteriy process,
The firs.t payment was to be made «n  the,1st of
July ensuing, being the. saiae-;day on, wWehf^ke
quarterly payments began; the.eeeohd Wagr.-to'^e
made on.the Iup(j&nmry,.l837,btif)gtii&g3ms
day on which the third qúatterly.paynjentfaeeanw
due; the third half payment was to' be made <m
the 1st of July, 1837; and. the fourth,-on the *w
of January, 1838.,. Now, what- i . th* .amount
which this second branch of thedistributi#fl-e)au*e
would have diverted from the Treasury, and in
what time? Sir, the amount would have«.b*ea
$31,653,380, and the time would have-been eighteen
months! Such would have been the amount
payable in that short time; for the sales of-the
lands in 1836 were $24,877,179, and for 1837 they
were $6,776,236, and this in addition to thesun 
required for the service of the Government in
1837, which was $39,000,000. The whole amount
which -would have -been required ibr'distribution
between, the 1st of July, 1836, and the 1stof Jan 
uary,-,1838, would have been $55,336,3694 and
the service.of the-Government for the same-.-time
.would, hase required just about as much mote.
