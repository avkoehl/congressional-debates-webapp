ORANGE, December 23, 1863.

Respectfully returned.

In a correspondence with His Excellency Governor Militia some time since General Lee stated that he would send this brigade or a part of it to Florida for the purpose indicated herein, provided a regiment would be sent here to supply its place. To this no response has been received. The interests of the service will not allow that the regiment be detached without an equivalent.

If the recruits or conscripts are in the State, it is thought they can as well be obtained by sending for them as by sending the brigade there to recruit them.

By order:

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
