Thus the actual cost of $100 worth of pig iron
imported into this country would bens follows:
Tirjt cost    «J00 00
Difference of exchange  21 00
Duty ill gold  55 00
Premium on gold duty    G 10
Actual cost, exclusive of freight and other
charges  1S2 18
Deduct first cost  100 00
§82 10
To this should be added six per cent, ou first
cost for freight, insurance, and other charges,
and ten per cent, on the wiiole for importers'
profits. The statement will then stand thus:
First cost $100 00
Difference of exchange  21 00
Duty in gold  55 00
Premium on gold duty  G 10
Freight, insurance, &c  0 00
188 10
Importers' profit of 10 per cent, on the whole.. 18 91
Cost at the point of competition in the Amer-
ican market  207 01
Deduct first cost  100 00
Leaving amount of actual protection $107 01
Freight439 for $100.
Thus, inconsequence of the combined oper-
ation of the tariff and a depreciated paper
currency, the actual protection which the Amer-
ican manufacturer receives in our markets
against the manufacturer of the foreign article
is 107 per cent. That is the measure of the
bounty which he receives and the tribute which
he compels the consumers of pig iron in this
country to pay through the instrumentality of
the tariff.

There are some people who would like to
save tliis $10 121 difference between free and
protected pig iron, \vhich at present goes into
some two hundred Pennsylvania pockets.
I now propose to show upon tuose data the
practical operation of the present tariff upon
the single article of pig iron so far as it operates
to produce revenue for the Treasury and eon-
tribute wealth to the pig iron-monger in the
form of bounty, which the tariff enables him
to filch from the pockets of the consumers of
that article in this country. I take the import-
ation of 1868, being the latest which I have at
hand.
X>W IKON BOUNTY.
Quantity entered for consumption, 112,345JJ
tons. Cost in England, §1,837,911, or about
§16 36 per ton; duty $9 per ton, or 55 per
cent, reduced to the ad valorem standard,
equal to Gl-j^ per cent, in paper money. Upon
these data the demonstration of the actual
cost of introducing the same into our market
:-t the point of competition with pig iron of
American manufacture will be thus :
Cost in England $1,837,911
Difference of excaange of 21 per cent  385,981
Duty 55 per cent, in gold, 61 in paper  1,121,125
Fi eight, insurance, and othercharges (esti-
mated) 6 per cent  110.274
3,455,271
To this sum add 10 per cent for profits of
importer  -  345,527
83.800,798
Thus when this quantity of iron, with duties,
exchange, freight, &c., superadded, is offered
in the market it costs, with the profits of the
importer, $3,800,798. Now at this point it
comes in competition with the artieles pro-
duced by the American manufacturer. Con-
sequently his "protection" or bounty is the
difference between the first cost and the cost
of the foreign article when it enters into com-
petition in the home market.
In order to show what that bounty is I
deduct—
From the cost, including all charges in our mar-
ket    $3,800,798
The cost in the market whenco imported.... 1,837,911
$1,962,887
being a fraction over 107 per cent. The
quantity of pig iron now annually manufac-
tured in this country is 1,725,000 tons. At the
same cost per ton of the same article in the
market of England, namely, $16 30 per ton,
its aggregate value is $28,221,000. This amount
is enhanced by the cost of the foreign article
at the point of competition in the home market
in the proportion of 107 per cent., equal to the
sum of $29,914,260. Whole amount of cost
and bounty, $29,914,260. Thus, in order to
get the sum of $1,121,125 into the Treasury
on the foreign article the people of this country
payin the shape of bounty to the pig iron man-
ufacturers of this country the sum of $29,914,-
260! No better illustration than this is needed
to show the enormities of this system of robbery
and rapacity miscalled the protective system.
I propose to prepare and append to my
printed speech similar calculations with regard
to other "protected" articles, including the
cotton, woolen, and various other manufac-
tures, all "protected" in the same way, all
contributing comparatively small sums to the
Treasury, but exacting enormous sums from
the people which go into the pockets of the
elasses interested in them, the owners of the
capital employed getting the largest share, ac-
cumulating thereby large fortunes, which
enable them to live in the splendor and luxury
of titled nabobs, while the share allotted to the
labor employed is sufficient only to supply the
necessaries of life with few of its comforts and
luxuries. And it is these men, engaged in
these "protected" industries, who are clamor-
ing for more duties, more bounties to swell
their own revenues, more burdens upon the
industries of the non-proteeted classes and
the consumers generally I What remorseless
and brazen-faced rapacity! It is astounding
that there are men and parties who dare up-
hold such a system. It is still more astound-
ing that the people will tolerate it.
If it were proposed that the Government
should levy by taxation $29,914,260 on the
people and give it to the pig-iron makers
what an outcry and clamor it would arouse
among the people! Would it not be resisted,
and justly and righteously, by arms if it could
not be got rid of in any other way? It would
be a glaring act of usurpation, a most daring
and dangerous exercise of despotic power.
Yet the wrong and outrage is done indirectly.
Through its legislation the Government enables
the pig-iron maker to wring that immense
sum from the pockets of the people through
the instrumentality of a duty upon the com-
peting foreign article. And the Government
does this wicked act avowedly; does it for the
express purpose of protecting" the pig-iron
interest. Under the false pretext of raising
revenue it enables the pig-iron manufacturer
to filch thirty times as much more from the
pockets of the people.
Let us see who are the beneficiaries of this
wholesale plunder of the people on the single
item of pig iron. In 1869 (see Commissioner
Wells's report on the industry, &c., of the
United States for 1869) the number of persons
employed in the manufacture of pig iron was
as follows:
At blast-furnaces 12,500
Preparation of ore and fuel  42,000
54,500
Allow for the families of these employes an
average of 6 persons, in all 372,000 persons.
These are the mere laborers and their over-
seers, and receive wages and salaries which are
but little if any more than sufficient to supply
them with the means of subsistence. Therprofits
of the business go to the owners of the capital
employed, numbering some 200 persons, and
those profits are immense. And ander this
system the Commissioner i>f Bevenue adds that
the manufacturers of pig iron have "realized
continued profits which have hardly any par-
allel in the history of legitimate industry,"
adding that one set of furnaces in one of the
middle States shows a product of 35,000 tons
on a capital of $450,000, sold at a profit of
from $10 to $13 per ton amounting at an
average of $11 50 per ton, to the sum of
$402,500, or nearly 100 per cent, of yearly
profits. And this is one of the "peculiar "
interests clamoring for increased protection
against foreign competiton! Thus are the
people compelled to pay nearly $30,000,000
annually in the shape of bounty to support
372,000 men, women, and children, and to put
into the pockets of the 200 owners of the capi-
tal invested the enormous profit of nearly 100
per cent, on an article which lies at the basis
of a thousand of the arts and uses of society.
And this is true of all the "protected"
interests. I have prepared similar tables show-
ing how those interests are affected by the
tariff; and also tables showing how the agri-
cultural States of the West and South are
affectedbythissystem miscalled "protection,"
which, as they embody mere dry statistics,
I forbear to inflict them upon the House at this
time. I propose to insert them in the appendix
to the Globe, as illustrations of the principles
I now lay down, carrying them out in detail
and thereby showing the sum in gross and per
capita which the people of the United States
are compelled to pay for the privilege of enjoy-
ing the benefits and blessings of the "protec-
tive system," which this scheme of robbery
and plunder is politely called.
AMERICAN INDUSTRY—"WHAT Ki XT ?
This system of duties and bounties is de-
vised upon the false and mistaken theory of
protecting " American industry." It is based
upon the principle of taking from the people
engaged in certain kinds of industry and giv-
ing to people engaged in certain other kinds
of industry. But why should one class of in-
dustry be thus favored and not another ? Are
not all the industries of this country "Ameri-
can industries V' It is true that several do not
come under the head of "protected" indus-
tries, because they produce surpluses of pro-
ducts which must find markets in foreign coun-
tries ; and therefore duties are inoperative upon
them, because little or none of such articles
are imported from abroad. Such are the pro-
ducts of agriculture for instance. Duties upon
wheat, upon corn, upon cotton are of no import-
ance, because such articles are not to any great
extent imported from foreign countries. The
farmer, therefore, must go abroad for a market
for his surplus. If he raises wheat he must
sell it, or the merchant must do it for him, in a
foreign market; and so of his com and his
cotton.
Suppose the farmer takes in exchange for
his wheat or his cotton sold in England a bale
of woolen cloth. Is not that cloth as much the
product of his capital and labor as though he
had actually manufactured it 1 His capital and
labor have purchased it. Therefore it is un-
doubtedly as much the fruit of his capital and
labor as if he had actually manufactured it.
He comes with his bale of cotton to a port in bis
own country and proposes to sell it in the market
there. But he is stopped at the custom-house and
told that he cannot sell it in this market until he
has paid a duty of from 60 to 90 per cent., which,
which with other charges superadded, amounts
to at least 100 per cent. He asks the collector of
customs why hisbale of cotton is thus burdened ?
The collector replies that it is partly to yet a
small amount of revenue in the Trea-'iry, !>ni
