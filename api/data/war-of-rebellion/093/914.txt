NASHVILLE, November 16, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Major General J. B. STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga:

Your organization of convalescents, &amp;c., is correct, and as I intended; but General Meagher having reported to me for duty, I must find a command for him, and therefore I wish you to give him the two brigades belonging to the Army of the Tennessee, viz, the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps, leaving the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps for General Cruft. You will soon have a large command of convalescents, &c., as they are constantly passing through this place to the front. Use this force to strengthen the garrisons of Whiteside's and Bridgeport, keeping the organization by corps together as much as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
