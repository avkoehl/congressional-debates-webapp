he received the intimation from you. But it would appear from his note that he received no orders to that effect. The commanding general directs that orders to the effect of those indicated last night be given to General Kautz if it has not been already done.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 19, 1864.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Commanding Cavalry, Army of the Potomac:

General Kautz finds no enemy in front of Sycamore Church, and reports that he will send back the brigade of the Second Division. The commanding general considers that the picket-line should be re-adjusted, so that Kautz will be charged with picketing from the Blackwater to the James, or rather watching the avenues of approach between them. By keeping orderlies at the telegraph office at Second Corps headquarters I can communicate with you more rapidly than by orderlies from here.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 19, 1864-5.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.,:

GENERAL: I have just received a report from General Kautz, through one of my staff officers whom I sent over to ascertain in regard to his movements. The whole country beyond Sycamore Church has been examined in every direction from four to five miles, and no trace of any force of the enemy met. General Kautz does not believe in the fact of any force having been there. I inclose General Kautz's report just received.*

Respectfully,

H. E. DAVIES, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,September 19, 1864

Captain H. C. WEIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Div., Cavalry Corps:

The scouting party sent out on the Gary's Church road has returned; found no enemy. All remains quiet this morning on the line.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. SMITH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
