Major JOHN S. HOPE,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Demopolis:

Arms and plenty ammunition was shipped by cars from Selma. Call on Major McCall to know what became of them. If men can't be armed of course no defense can be made. In that event everything should be brought to this side and nothing left for enemy to cross with. Instruct Major Whitfield to remove such portions of engines as will prevent the enemy from using them. The parts so removed should be brought west of the river. This last in case of danger.

Major JOHN S. HOPE,

Demopolis:

Call on Major McCall for any arms and ammunition he or Major Price may have that it is practicable to use. The men must have them. Care should be taken to prevent their waste or loss and secure their return in good order if not used. If news of Jackson's victory be true his position ought to cover Demopolis. Get in communication with him, if possible, and learn latest news of Forrest, Chalmers, and of Selma. If Jackson covers Demopolis no issue of arms should be made.
