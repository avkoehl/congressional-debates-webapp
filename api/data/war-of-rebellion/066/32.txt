GENERAL: On examining a young man who has come to-day through the enemy's line I got the following information, which I am inclined to put some faith in:

The enemy' number in our front is about 10,000, 1,000 of whom are at Baldwin throwing up intrenchments, the remainder encamped at McGirt's Creek. An outpost of two regiments of cavalry and one of infantry is established at Cedar, a few pickets east of the creek. General Anderson is in command, assisted by General Finegan and Colquitt. Generals Taliaferro and Gardner are at Baldwin, but have no commands and are to return to Charleston.

Baldwin is being strongly fortified. The works were laid out by General Beauregard, and are still incomplete. General Colquitt's troops have been under marching orders for the weeks. The force opposite Palatka is small; our force there much exaggerate, it being believed that our main force is there.
