self, if, viewing the&igab of the times, I could stand by and see
her j u¡  claims overlooked, her rights wrested Irani her, with
out an effort to maintain them It I know myself, sir, I have
no othei leetmg towards any portion of our wide-spread Union
than thatof waim attachment, but I must frankly say that I
love, ab tve all the State which gave me birth Nor will West-
ern gentlemen, who now, and on all occasions, so zealously de
fend the mteiests oí their own constituents, condemn me for
vindicating those of mine I go further, sir They boast, and
lugly, perhaps, of the growing importance and power ef the
n w ¡state*, but when they find an Eastern or Southern man
seeing by un Ije concossi ms to conciliate their favor? I warn
taemuotto tiust him If treacheious enough to sacrifice the
rights and interests of his own constituents, with a view to sel
fi^b ends, they may i est assured he will never prove true to
0  hers when the same motive shall piompt him to betray them
Tne subject of the public domain, Mi   Chairman, has been
discussed as if the United States possessed an unlimited right tó
dispose of it at their will and pleasure Such, sir, is not the
fact They hold a large part of it—all that ceded by the States
—undersolemn stipulations, which they cannot violate They
are mere trustees, and the terms, being in themselves essen
ti-illy just, apply with equal moral force to the lands since ac
quired by purchase These propositions would seem too clear
Jor argument I will not enter at large into their examination,
nor cite the many gi eat names by which they have been de
monstialed It will be all sufficient to reler to the opinions of
one whose authority this committee will not question Gene
ral Jackson, in his Message oí 5th Uecembei, lb3S, putting his
veto on the land bill take&a full view of the rightsol the States
and asscrtb the obligation of this Government to maintain
them It will be gratifying to hisfnends, no doubt, to lefresh
*hen recollection by citing the doctrines of this learned jurist
1  do not know—I must say, m answ r to a gentleman near me
—whether it, was this veto Message which raised him to the
rank of doctor of laws, or whether the degree was contened
for the learning displayed in the proclamation or protest Be
this as it mav, the argument alluded to, so far as respects the
present question, was never refuted, and I believe it to be lire
iu table    Permit me, sn, to cite a few passages
After giving a hi&tory of the waste land held by the original
States, he speaks of the motives which induced them to sui len
der h He quotes the terms of the < ession made by Virginia,
(lit March, 1784,+) and the clause in the Constitution grvmg
power to Congiess to dispose of the territory of the United
States I   He then says
'Toe Constitution left all the compacts before made in full
force and the rights of all parties remained the same under the
new Government as they were under the Confederation
And add*
' Bv the fa< ts here collected from the early history of our
Republic, it sppe us that ti e subject ofthe public landsentered
into the elements ol its ins ltutions It was only upon the con
dmon that those lands should be considered as common propei
ty, to be disposed of for the benefit of the United States, that
some ofthe States agieed to come into a 'perpetual union '
Tae States claiming those lands acceded to those views, and
transferred then claims to the United States, upon certain spe?
cific conditions, and on those conditions the grants were accept
ed The solemn compacts, invited by Congress in a resolu
tion declaring the purposes to which the proceeds of these lands
should be applied, originating before the Constitution, and form
mg th basis on which it was made, bound the United States to
a particular course of policy in lelation to them, by ties as
stróngascan b* invented to spcure the faith of nations "
This, sir, is strong language
Advertios to the ordinance of 1787, which he tells us was
mide to secure to the Government of the United States, (or
etei, the power to execute these compacts in good faith, he
quotes the aitic'c which declares that the new States shall
never interfere with the pumary disposition of the soil by the
tinned States, nor with any regulations Congress may find ne
cessary for securing the title m such soil to the bona fide pur
chasers
From all this he deduces several distinct propositions, affirm
ing, m substance, the obligation ofthe Government to dispose
ol the waste lands, tor the common benefit of the States, accord
ing to the proportions stipulated in the de ds of cession The
pledge of those lands for the payment of the public debt he
cons tiers as pi actically conforming to this obligation But that
debt, he says, may be considered as paid, and the lands conse
quently releaaed irom the lien
Now mark the grounds, sir, upon which he rejected the land
bill I will reler to the hrst two object ons only In a spirit of
concession, perhapstoo liberal, the bill proposed to give to the
new States 12| per c*eQt out ofthe proceeds, and then to divide
the residue ratably among all Referring to this proposal, he
siys
"The bill begins with an entiie subversion of everyone of
¿he compacts b> which the United Spates became possessed of
the western domain, and tieats the subject as if they never had
exis'ence, and as if the United States were the original and un
conditional owners oi all the public lands "
Again
"This twelve and a half per cuit is to be taken out of the
nett proceeds of the land sales, befoie any apportionment is
mide, and the same seven States which are first to recurve
this proportion a e also to leceive their due propoition of the
leiidue, acoidmg to the ratio of general distribution
•Now waving all considerations of equity or policy in re
gir 1 to this provision, what more need he said to demonstrate
lisooiect'onable chuaetei, thin that it tó in direct and undis
gtiised viola ion. of thp pledge gu en by Congiev* to the
Slates, befne a single cession was made, that it abrogates the
t' That all the lands withm the terntory so ceded to the
United States, and i ot íeserveufoi or appiopnated to any of
the before menu med pui poses, or dispo&ed of in bounties to Vte
officers and soldiers of the American army, shall be considered
as a common fund, for the «se and benefit of such of the Tim
ted States as have become, or shall become, members of the
Confederation, or Federal alliance ofthe said States, Virginia
inclusive according to their usual respective proportions in
the zenei al chai ge and expenditure, and shall be faithfully
and bona fide disposed oftox that purpose, and foi no other use
or purpose whatsoever '
*' The CongiesB shall have power to dispone of and make
all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or
other propeity belonging to thelmted States, and nothing in
this Constitution shall be eonstrued to prejudice any claims of
the flatted States, or of any particular State,"
condition upon which some of the States came into the
Union, and that tt sets at nought the terms of cession spread
tipon the face of every %rantt under which the title to that
portion of the public land is held by the Federal Govern
mem?'*
His second ubjection is founded upon the same principle
"In the apportionment (he observes) of the remaining seven
eights of the proceeds, this bill, in a mannei equally urn i^
guised, violates the conditions upon which the United States
acquired title to the ceded lands Abandoning altogether the
ratio oTf disnbution, according to the general charge and ex
penditure, provided by the compacts, it adopts that of the Fedc
ral lepresentative population Virginia ard other States
which ceded their land* upon the express condition that they
should receive a benefit fiom their sales inpi opovtion to their
part of the gene/ al charge* are, by the bill, allowed only a
portion of seven eights of their proceeds, and that not in the
proportion of general charge and expen inure, but in the ratio
of their Fedeiat representative population "
Having thus warmly reprobated the injustice ofdeprmrg
the old States of any portion of their just share in the public
domain he proceeds to observe
"The Constitution of the United States did not delegóte to
Congress th* power to abrogate these compacts On the con
traiy, by declaring that nothing in it 'shall be so construed as
to prejudice any claims of the Uut^ed States, ol ol any particu
lai State,' it virtually provides that these compacts, and the
rights they secute, shall remain untouched by the legislative
power, which shall only make all 'needful rules and regula
tions for carrying them into effect' All beyond this would seem
to be an assumption of undelegated power '
Such, sir, was the respect manifested, some few vears past,
by the Chief Magistrate of this Union—himself a Western
man—for the obligation of this Government to re leeni its pledge
and execufe its contracts m good faith— 'hese invaluable monu
ments, as he termed them, of an age of virtue, patriotism, and
disinterestedness Hut a new light has dawned upon us, and
doub s begin to be suggested as to the true meaning or obligatory
force of explicit engagements, the most solemn that couldbe
devised to secure the faith of nations This Government, it
is more than insinuated, may ¿ell the lands for t nominal price,
orsunender them unconditionally to the States in which they
lie and these ideas, strange to s ty, aie thought to be shadowed
forth in the officii I communications of the same Chief Magie
trate, whoso triumphantly asserts the ughtsofdllthe States to
an eq atable participation It must be-acknowledged, sir, that
theieis some ground for this charge of inconsistency, gross as
it is In his message ot December, 1832, General Jackson says
" It seems to me to be oui true policy that the public lands
shoul \ cease as soon as piacticable to be a voui ce of revenue,
and that they be sold to settlers in limited paicels, at a price
barely sufficient to i cimburse the L nited States the expente of
the piesei t sybiein, and the cost arising uiidei our Indian com
pacts ' And a Ma. 1 i^ desuable tlwt, in convenient time

States^ respectively, in which they I e
He repeats theae suggestions in the verv message fiom which
I have i ust quoted an argument demonstrating that such surren
der would be a palpable violation of our plighted faith
The present incumbent, following m his footsteps, insinuates
the same policy, an 1 almost m the same words He tells us in
his lact annual message, that "the time will come when it will
be theirwe policy of the General Government as to some of the
States, to transfer to them, for a reasonable equivalent, all the
refuse and unsold land--, and to teithdi aw the machinery of the
Federal land offices alroge'her " Both the pitsent and last Ad
ministrations, tt would appear, then, conciu m recommending
asurrender o1" the lands But, more just or more wary than
his predecessor, Mr Van Buren does not piopose to yield them
up without an equivalent Nor, indeed, can it be believed that
Gen Tackson although he does not in terms propose an equi
valent could have intended so gross an outrage upon rights he
had hims If so ably vindicated It is strange enough that he
who consid red the division among the States, in the ratio of
their repiesentation, as the most safe, |u i, and federal di&posi
Hon which couldbe nsale of a surplus of general levenue,
should find an insurinuiiutable difficulty in dividing among them
the proceeds ofthe public lantbt which this Government is ex
pressly bound to dispose of for their common benefit But it is
inconceivable that he who pronounced the division of those
proceeds, as proposed by the land bid, an undisguised violation
ot the pledge given by Congress, because itgave an advantage to
the new States of \2\ pei c*nt onlybeyondtbeirduepiopoition,
could have coutemplatedagratuitoussurrenderof the whole I
cannot ascribe to 1 un an intention indicating so unaccountable a
pei version of intellect, oi so monstious an obliquity of the mo
ral sense The \ery grounds on which he rejected the land
bill, I repeat present an u >answeiable argument against the
pretens on I could hope to add nothing to the force of that ar
gument, weie I to attempt it I am willing to leave it wheie
he ha  placed it, and will now turn ( the question more imme

upon the public property, nor, unless for peculiar consideia
tuns to sanction them after they were committed It seems,
bir, that tlu.y weie but m the horn hook of politics —not half a
century, but a centur> an 1 a half, at leasy—l?eirm.a' the flight
ensd statesmen of the Jackson era   Thsy were simplecjiough
to imagine that some respect ought to be paid to the laws of
the land One of their earliest measure*, imioded upon that
antiquated notion, was to prohibit unlawful entries on the pub
lie domain They actually treated it as an offence and, as far
back as Í7R5, required a proclamation tu- be issued, warning ail
persons against committing it Those who followed them
continued to blunder on m the same way for a succession &f
years In 1807 they went much further They not o#l}* a«*
thonzed the removal of all intruders by the marshal, a#d, if
need be, by military force, but subjected them to a criminal
prosecu ion—to fine and impnsonment
Nor can it be said that this law has ever been repeated or has
feecome obsolete Had the gentleman from Mississippi more
closely examined the past history of our legislation, he would
have lp«nd that Congrei>s not only refused, even upon tin3 appli-
cation ofthe Legislature of his ow n State, to relieve aaamst the
law of 1807, but that they repeatedly leasseited the policy tf-at
law was designed to enforce- I will not fatigue the coiimrnee,
sr, by a special reference to the earlier recognitions of that
policy, nor comment upon them 1 will refet those who doubt
to the more recent reports only, (in 1824, ?25, and '26) from the
Committee on the Public Lands oí this House, composed, I
doubt not, then, as now for the most fart, of Western men
No general law ft as ever passed confirming illegal settlements,
until that of May, 1830, nor did that law, noi either oftho^e
since passed m 1S32 and 1834, repeal the act of lb07, they quie'ed
the settlers in possession, but did not legalize «urh entnes in
future
The gentleman from Mnsissippi contends that the act of
1807 s to regarded as abrogated, because it has not been en
forced He asks, why has the Government neglected to enfoice
ul S r, Í echo the question, and should be glad to heai a «atts
fac ory ¿newer How, sir has it hi opened that the Jaft n
cum bent of the Presidential office above all hds peimittei
these settlements to go on unchecked, until the in'rn lers are
numeious enough to dety the power of the Government Had
he been as vigilant to plevpnt viola ions of law m the V* est as
m the c-ovth, this state of things could never ha\e arisen
There has been a shameful dereliction of duy on ths partol
the Government, and the consequence is, a ruinous sacrifice
of publifc interests and depravation of puolce morals In 1?30
the Executive was informed of fraudulent combinations, be
tween the settlers and speculators to keep down the pnce oí
the public land, and share the spoils among themselves The
information was communicated in obedience to the call of this
House, on the 38th day of May, and then only in a dry, neked
transmiseion, by the Secretary of the Treasury of the letters
he had received, without stating that any measures had been
taken to suppress or defeat such \ ile attempts This ccmrru
mcatlon was immediately followed up by the act 9f the £9fh of
the same month, rewarding all intruders, up to that time, bv
g % mg them a right of pie empaon, not mertly to a sufficiency

and sixty acrec, ant! when the same quartei section has been
