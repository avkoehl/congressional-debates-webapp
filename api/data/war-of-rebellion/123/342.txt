WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 9, 1862.

Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

The general order of the Department is to place the arms for distribution in the hands of an officer of the Government who will be responsible for them. This has been rendered necessary by the extreme negligence in some of the States, by which arms have been lost and the troops unequipped. But where, as in Ohio, the distribution of arms will be diligently and promptly attended to, an exception from the general rule can be made. If you prefer, therefore, to distribute the arms to your troops, an order will be given to the mustering officer to turn them over to you for that purpose.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
