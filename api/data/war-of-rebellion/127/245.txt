A PROCLAMATION BY JOSEPH E. BROWN, GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.

Whereas, by the oppressive and wicked conduct of the Government and people of that part of the late United States of America known as the anti-slavery States, war actually exists between them and the people of the Southern States; and

Whereas, the President of the United States has issued his proclamation declaring his determination to blockade the ports of the Southern States and is now collecting Federal troops upon Southern soil for the purpose of subjugating and enslaving us; and

Whereas, property belonging to citizens of the State of Georgia, whenever found within the anti-slavery States, is seized and forcibly taken from its owners; and

Whereas, all contracts made with the enemy during the existence of hostilities are, by the law of nations, illegal and void, and all remedies for the enforcement of contracts in our courts between citizens of this State and citizens of the States now making war upon us, which were made prior to the commencement of hostilities, are suspended till the termination of the war; and

Whereas, in the language of the law of nations, "the purchase of bills on the enemy's country, or the remission and deposit of funds there, is a dangerous and illegal act, because it may be cherishing the resources and relieving the wants of the enemy; and the remission of funds in money or bills to subjects of the enemy is unlawful; " and

Whereas, sound policy, as well as international law, absolutely forbids that any citizen of this State shall, under any pretext whatever, assist the enemy by remitting, paying, or furnishing any money or other thing of value, during the continuance of hostilities, to the Government of people of the States which have waged and are maintaining a most unnatural and wicked war against us; and

Whereas, justice requires that all sums due from citizens of this State to individuals in such hostile States who do not uphold and sustain the savage and cruel warfare inaugurated by their Government should be promptly paid so soon as hostilities have ceased and the independence of the Confederate States is recognized by the Government of the United States:

Therefore, in view of these considerations, I, Joseph E. Brown, Governor and commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the State of Georgia, do issue this my proclamation, commanding and enjoining upon each citizen or inhabitant of this State that he abstain absolutely from all violations of the law above recited, and that he do not, under any pretext whatever, remit, transfer, or pay to the Government of the United States, or any one of the States composing said Government which is known as a free-soil State, including among others the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, or to any citizen or inhabitant of any such State, any money, bills, drafts, or other things of value, either in payment of any dept due or hereafter to become due, of, for, or on account of any other cause whatever, until the termination of hostilities.
