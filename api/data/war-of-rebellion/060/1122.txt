Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

The following dispatch just received:

FORT BOYKIN, January 25, 1864.

Captain N. W. SMALL,

Signal Officer:

Four gun-boats passed up the river at about 1 p. m. Causey reports an advance from Old Point and Newport News toward Williamsburg and Yorktown.

MILLIGAN,

Major.

The gun-boats are now reported opposite Lower Brandon, 10 a. m. If the two gun-boats were below the obstructions, as promised by the Secretary of the Navy, it would be worth 5,000 men to us.
