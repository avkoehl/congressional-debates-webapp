Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Missouri:

Colonel Harrison, commanding at Fayetteville, dispatches that bushwhackers are crossing the river in small squads; deserters from Price's army coming north, and that they are becoming troublesome about Fayetteville, and desires me to send some cavalry to scour the country. I cannot spare any troops at present. It would no doubt be policy to meet and destroy these bands as far south as possible, if troops can be spared to do it from other portions or sections of the State.

Dispatch about rebel deserters and bushwhackers at Fayetteville received. Colonel Harrison should communicate with headquarters Department of Arkansas. We have no troops to spare at present. Tell Colonel Harrison to keep a bright lookout and report news to you. Aid him to the extent of your force if it becomes necessary.

Colonel HARRISON,

Commanding at Fayetteville, Ark.:

I will be able to send some cavalry in your direction in about a week, but cannot before. how many armed men have you now? Can you not spare some dismounted men to lie about in the vicinity of Huntsville and fight the guerrillas? The guerrillas were very thick on the Buffalo Fork of White River. Our troops have kiled and captured more than 50 during the past eight days. Have you heard form Price's army lately? Is our Fort Smith train on the way back yet?

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
