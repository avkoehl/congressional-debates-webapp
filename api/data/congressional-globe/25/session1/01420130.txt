Tne Senator iioniMaSsa I aselts <, \Ir Webster)
has. emphatically demanded how the bankrupt
power could be fairly exercised by seizing on cor-
porations and banksrs, and exludmg all the other
usual subjects ot bankrupt laws'* I answer, by
following the example of that England to which he
has conducted us , by oopymg the act of the 30 h
of Edward the Th r 1, by going back io tnat reign
of heroism, patriotism, and wisdom, th it reign m
which the monan h acquired as much glory from his
domestic policy as from his foiegn conquests,
that reign m which the acquisition of dyers and
wearers from Flanders, the observance of law
and justice, and the encouragement given to agn-
eulture and manufactures, coiferred mere benefit
apon the kmgdo n, and more glory upon the king,
than the splendid victories of Pollers, Agincourt,
and Cressy
But the Senator may not be willing to yield to
this example—this case m point—drawn from his
own fountain, and piccisel} up to the exigency
of the occasun He may want «omefhmg moie,
and he shall have it I will now take the ques-
tion upon its broadest bottom, and fullest merits I
will go to (he question of geneial power—the point
of general authority—exemplified by the general
practice of the British Parliament, foi five hun-
died years, over the whole subject of bankiuptcy
I will tiy the quection upon this basis, and here I
lay down the ptoposition, that this five hundied
years of parliamentary legislation on b mkruptcj,
establishes the point of full atithoiity in the Bntish
Parliament to act as it pleased on the entire sub
jectof bankiuptcies This is my proposition, and
when it i  proved, I shall claim from those who
cany me to En land for authonty, the same
amount of power ovei the subject which the
British Parliament has been in the habit of
exercising Now, what is the extent ot tnat pow -
er? Happily for me, I, who have to speak, with ut
any inclination for the task—still moie happily for
those who have to hear m", perad/entuie without
profit or pleasure—happily for boih parties, my
proposition is alieady proved, partly by what I have
previously" advanced, and fully by what every
Senator knows I have already shown the prac
tice of Parliament upon this subject—that it has
altered and changed—coatracted and enlarged—
put in and left out—abolished and created, precise-
ly as it pleased I have already shown, m my
lap d view of English legislation on this subject,
that die Parliament exercised plenatv power, md
unlimited authoutv over cvei/ bruno i of the
bankrupt question, that it confined the action of
(he bankrupt ¡aw s to a single class of peisons, or
extended it to many classes, that it was some-
umes confined to ibreigneis, then applied to na-
tives, and that now it comprehends natives, aliens,
denuens and women , that <tt one time all debtors
were subject to it, then none but merchants and
traders, and now, besides men-hams and tFadeis
a long list of persons who ha/e m thing to do with
t ade that at one time bankiuptcy wis treated
criminal!}, and its object punished coiporeally,
while now it is i remedial measure for the benefit
of the creditor", and the relief oí unfortunate
debtt is and that the acts of the debtor v hieh may
constitute him a bailaupt, have been enlarged
from three or four glaring misdeeds, to so long a
catalogue of aetions divided into the heads of inno
cent and fraudulent—conductive and positiv e—
intentional and unintentional—v oluntai y <,n 1 foi ced
—flat none but an attorney, with boo! in hard,
can pretend to enumerate them A H th s has been
shown, and from all this it is incontf stable that
Parlnment can do just what i p'ease on the tub
ject, and, theiefoie, our Congress, if íeferW to
.England ior its poner?, can do just what >t
pleases al<o Arc! thus, whether «i. go by the

1 demands whether bankrupt laws ordinarily extend
I to corporation^ meaning moneyed corporations I
au fr°e '„ U"' t'i-'t 11 po nt of Cct, they do
not But uhji nrcau-e t'tev ought i of or because
th<"se corporations hav e yet been powerful enough,
or fortunate enough, to keep their necks out of that
noose'* Ce-tain y the latter It is the power of
these moneyed corpoiationsin England, and their
good foi tune m our America, which, enabling them
to gra^p all advantages c one hand, and to
repulse all penalties on the other, has enabled them
to obtain expiess ^tatuwy exemption from "bank-
rupt liabilities in England, and to escape, thus far,
from similar liabilities m the United Sta es This,
sir, is history and not invective, it is fact, and not
assertion, and I will speedily refresh the Senator's
memoT, and bring h m to recollect why it is, in
point of fact, that bankrupt law  do not usually
extend to the^e coiporations And, first, let us look
to England, that great exemplar whose evil exam-
ples we aie so piompi, v/hose good ones w e are so
slow, to imitate How stands this question of coi-
po'-ation unlnbil ty there'2 Br the judicial cor-
struction of the statute of Elizabeth, the partneis in
all incorporated compan eswere held subject to the
bankiupt law, and under this constiuctioi, a com-
mission of bankrupt was issued against Sir John
Wo'stenholme, a gentleman of large 'brtune, who
had advanced a sum of money on an adventure in
the East India Company's trade The issue of this
commission was affirmed by the Court of King's
Bench, but this nappened to take place m the reign
of Charles the Second—that reign during which so
little is found worthy of imitation in the govern-
ment of Gtpat Britain—and immediately two acts
of Parliament were passed, one to annul the judg-
ment of the Couit of King's Bench in the ca«e of
Su John Wolstenholme, and the other tojirevent
any such judgments from being given in future

rated b> lelti rs patent f Q til  King, and then they
cut off all those even chartered by act of Par-
liament, which are not commercial, or trading m
their nature This saves but a few out of the
hundreds-of thousands of corporations which abound
in England, Scotland, Wal-s, and Ireland It sav es,
or rather confirms, the exemption of the Bank ,of
England, which is a trader in money, and it con-
firms, also, the exemption of t le East India Com-
pany, which is, m contemp'at on of law at least, a
commercial company, and t saves or exempts a
few others deiívng chai ters of incorporation from
Parliament, but it leaves subject to the law the
whole wildfinev, of corporations, of which there
are thousands in London alone, which derive
from prescription, or letters patent, and it also
leaves subject to the same laws all the corpora-
tions created by ch?rter act of Parliamen", which
are not commercial or trading The w orcú of the
act are very pecu'iar, "charter act of Parliament,'
so that coiporations by a general law, without a
special chaiter ael, are not moulded in the exemp-
tion Tms ati'wtr, added to what has been pre-
viously said, must be a sufficient reply to the Sena-
tor   question, whether bankrupt laws ordinarily
extend to corporatio is' Sir, out of the myriad of
corporat ons in Great Britain, the bankrupt law
extends to the whole, except some half dozen, or
dozen.
So much for the exemption of these corporations
m Engh'id, nowfor our America We never had
but one banl rupt law in the United States, and
that for the short period oí three or tour jears It
was passed under the administration of the elder
Mr Adams, and repealed under Mr Jefferson It
copied the English acts in including among the
subjects of bankruptcy, bankers, brokers, and fac-
tots Corporations were not includ-rt , and it is
probable thai no question was raised about them,
as up to that tine tl •* r nn pber w ns fe v, and the r
conduct gt leral'y good Bu , at a later date, the
enactment of a ban! t apt law was again attempted
in our Congiess, and, at that period, the multipli-
cation and the misconduct oí banks presented them
to the minds of many as ptoper subjects for the
application of the law I speak of the bill of 1827,
brought into the Senate, and lost That bill, like
all previous laws since the time of Geo-ge II, was
made applicable to bankers, brokers, and factors
A Senator from North Carolina (Mr Branch)
moved to include banking corporations The mo-
tion was lost, there being but tvvetvs votes for it,
but in tins twelve there w ere some whose names
mu&t c?iry weight to any cause to which they are
attached The twelve were, Messrs Barton, Ben-

Noble, Randolpn, Reed Smith of South Carolina,
and White The whole of the fn«nds of the bill,
twenty-one in number,-voted against the proposi-
tion, (¡he present Chief Magistrate in the n ember,)
