The Governor called for 2,000 riflemen, each man to bring his gun, to be taken by the State at valuation and converted into minie rifles, shooting sixty balls to pound. In response to this call ten companies are in camp at Murfreesborough, Middle Tennessee, and their guns are being converted into the minie at the rate of 300 per week. Other companies more than sufficient to fill the call have tendered themselves and are marching or preparing to march into encampment. It is believed that from 4,000 to 5,000 men armed in this way can be raised in the State as twelve-months' volunteers.

Total infantry, about 19,400; total cavalry, 2,079; total artillery, 558; sappers and miners, 44.

The State is making good sabers at the rate of thirty per day, casting cannon, making powder, and will soon be doing so on a considerable scale, as well as making guns in considerable numbers of superior quality; making caps in large quantities.
