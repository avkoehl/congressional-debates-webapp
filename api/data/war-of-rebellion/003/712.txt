CAMP BELMONT, MO., September 30, 1861.

Colonel ADEN LOWE, Bloomfield, Mo.:

DEAR COLONEL: Since writing to you yesterday I have received orders to march immediately, and will leave this camp on to-morrow, to take my baggage to New Madrid, and, leaving all the tents and heavy baggage there, I will take my active and efficient force, and immediately march with me. You can leave your tents, or rent hoses for those who remain, and, by furnishing an abundance of hay and straw, you can probably have blankets enough for those who march with you. I propose to be at Sikeston by Wednesday at noon. I wish you to be at Sikeston by Wednesday at noon. I wish you to be ready to march by that time, and move up to Spring Hill. By that time I will have determined whether we will (I on one side of the swamp and you on the other) move direct on Cape Girardeaou. I will rely on you for 500 efficient men, and more, if you can have them. I propose a thirty days' active campaign, and hope will have effected enough in that time to retire on our laurels. Let me know at Sikeston, by special courier, the number and condition of your force, the quantity of ammunition you need, &amp;c., so that I can send over to you all you need at Spring Hill. If we move separately, I will send you a battery of cannon. Write to me by every opportunity that is safe.

Yours, &c.,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
