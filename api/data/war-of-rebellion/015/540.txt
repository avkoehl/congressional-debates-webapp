The best information I can ge shows that Jackson left Winchester about 11 a. m. Friday, his train in front. He encountered Fremont's advance near Cedar Creek, which he held in check on Saturday until his troops passed up the valley. His rear guard then took a position upon a hill 2 miles beyond Strasburg, which he held Sunday and Monday. The cannonading there is described as terrific by the people. The last heard of him was that he was at New Market. His entire force is represented as near 40,000 by the people of Winchester.

From report of an eye-witness to the retreat of Jackson, being at Strasburg, Jackson reached Strasburg Friday evening late. Fremont arrived within 5 miles of Strasburg some time unknown to Jackson, via Moorefield, Wardensville, and over the mountain by the Hardy grade. A rebel scout in that direction discovered him, showed themselves in two or three places, and then sent a young lad to Fremont's force to say that Jackson was there with his artillery, infantry, &amp;c. This delayed the advance some time. In the mean time Jackson fell back to near Rude's Hill, 5 miles above Strasburg. Fighting began Sunday 1st, a. m., and continued Sunday and Monday all day, with very sharp musketry discharges. Many of our prisoners escaped at Mount Jackson. Fremont's pursuit close and Jackson himself much excited. Tuesday morning Jackson at New Market; last at Harrisonburg. Secessionists say Fremont occupied Rude's Hill and Jackson cut through. This is not true.
