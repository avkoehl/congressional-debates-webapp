NEW CREEK, May 8, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

General Sigel started 500 cavalry to Romney the 6th. He cannot let me have the Sixth Virginia Cavalry.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

NEW CREEK, May 8, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Unless circumstances have charged your views I will order one Ohio regiment of Grafton, and the other to New Creek, and advise them to draw at Parkersburg the necessary camp and garrison equipage, except tents. Please answer.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CUMBERLAND, MD., May 8, 1864.

Colonel Wilkinson,

New Creek:

The regiments I intended for Grafton and New Creek were ordered by the Secretary of War to report at Wheeling, where transportation is in readiness. If any other Ohio regiments are at Parkersburg, one may be ordered here and the other to Harper's Ferry.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

NEW CREEK, May 8, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Might there be a mistake? The Ohio troops at Parkersburg may be those expected to report at Wheeling.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CUMBERLAND, May 8, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

What regiments of Ohio troops are at Parkersburg? Is transportation ready there for them? I think the troops at Parkersburg are not those indicated in the telegram of the Adjutant-General as ordered to report at Wheeling.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

NEW CREEK, May 8, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

The One hundred and thirty-third, Colonel G. S. Innis, and One hundred and thirty-fourth, Colonel J. B. Armstrong, Ohio National Guard, are at Parkersburg. I have directed Mr. Coffran to send transportation, and report when it will ready.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.
