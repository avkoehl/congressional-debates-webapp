ask for its immediate consideration.

I ered as in Committee of the Whole. It is a
i direction to the Secretary of the Treasury to
pay to the owners of the brig Ocean Belle the
sum of $2,972 in full for damage to the brig
from worming while under impressment from

to be engrossed for a third reading, read the
third time, and passed.

row morning I shall ask to take from the table

indulgence of the Senate to occupy a short time

COTTON CASES.
Mr. ABBOTT. I offer the following reso-
lution, and ask for its present consideration:
Remitted, That the Secretary of the Treasury be
requested to inform the Senate at his earliest con-
venience how much of the appropriations heretofore
made, amounting to $100,000, to provide for the de-
fense of certain suits now pending in the Court of
Claims known as the cotton cases, has been expended,
and that he state to whom the same has been paid,
for what services rendered, and the amount paid to
each of said persons; and also the number of clerk3
in the Treasury Department and other persons, with
their names, engaged or occupied in the defense of
said suits: Prowled, That such statement be in bis
opinion not incompatible with the publio interests.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. POMEROY. I did not understand how
the resolution commenced. To whom is it
addressed ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. To the Secre-
tary of the Treasury.
Mr. POMEROY. I submit that the Secre-
tary of the Treasury cannot judge of what will
be compatible or incompatible with the public
interests. The President is the judge of that.
We have but one executive department.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Kansas suggests that the resolution be directed
to the President instead of the Secretary of the
Treasury, and that the proviso be stricken
out.
Mr. ABBOTT. Certainly; I have no objec-
tion to that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears
no objection, and the resolution will be so
modified. The Secretary will now report it as
modified.
The Secretary read as follows:
Retolved, That the President be requested to in-
form the Senate, if not in his opinion incompatible
with the publio interests, 4c.
Mr. POMEROY. That is satisfactory to me.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If no other Sen-
ator desires the reading of the resolution as
modified, the Chair will take the sense of the
Senate "upon it.
The resolution, as modified, was adopted.
