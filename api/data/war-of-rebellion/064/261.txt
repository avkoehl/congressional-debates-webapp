circumstances, but to be killed when found. If a man is not known to be a guerrilla and taken without arms, and afterward proves to be a guerrilla, he must be regularly tried. Such trials, however, only result, where the prisoner is convicted, in putting the Government to the expense of boarding and lodging him during the war, as the President rarely approves a sentence of death. It is therefore best to take few prisoners.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., June 7, 1864.

General EWING, Commanding:

The following order has been sent all my subordinates:

You will not capture under any circumstances any man known to be a guerrilla or acting with them; they will be killed when and where found.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., June 7, 1864.

General EWING, Commanding:

We have been taking few prisoners. We have only taken 2, and the excuse of the men taking them was that they were unarmed. I have just examined them, and find them the worst of men. They say they were sent up here by Kitchen and told to bring back a horse when they returned from furlough; it was a great mistake to capture them. My men shall work.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., June 7, 1864.

General EWING, Commanding:

The following received from Charleston:

Colonel ROGERS:

I received a letter yesterday from Captain Guthrie; says he is in here recruiting; has commission; says his men all belong to the Confederate Army-must be treated as prisoners of war; says he has orders to keep the telegraph down for a certain time and will do it; says he saw our scouts Sunday while he was writing. I am trying to find out if they have a camp.

J. A. EWING,

Commanding, Charleston.

I can't see the prisoner of war part of it.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., June 7, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel HILLER, Bloomfield:

The guerrillas are tearing down the telegraph line below Charleston nightly; Ewing is after them. I send 100 men to Sikeston to-day and below; you will send men in below to co-operate with them.
