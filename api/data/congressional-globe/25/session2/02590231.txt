on file in the public oiticea relative to light houses, ex which
was adopted
Mr BEN TON submitted the following resolution
Resoled, I Int the Seerefcny oí State be directed to commu
nicate to the Senate all the information and coirespnndence in
his office relative to the project ot publishing a documental y
history ot the American Revolution, with a statement of ail
appropriations and exoendnures for that work, and an estimate
of all further appropriations to beieqmred tberefor to supply
the 2ist and 2áti CongiGs-es, and also to suppiy the new mem*
bers of the 2311,24th, and 2jth ( ongie«s^s
Mr BEMON said his object in miking the proposed m
quiry wag occasioned by a letter foun 1 that morning on his desk
irom the becretary of State, mtormmg him that the first volume
of the fourth serte&of the documentary history of the American
Revolution, published under the act of Congress of 1333, had
been forwarded, and requesting an acknowledgment of its re
ceipt Mr H and it was welJ known that he had, on foimei
occasion*, made the most strenuous exertions to stop appiopria
lions for woiks that appealed to have no limit, and foi which a
former Secretary of the ¡senate had con«ideied himself entitled
to thanks for reducing some lorn or five hundred thousand dol
lars less than was originally contemplated by the patties He
thought the whole m«utei had long since been done w uh, and
the appropna ions stopped H s memory, however, it ap
peared, had deceiv ed him \\ ho could say where this expen
diture was to stop* flight not the new membeis of all "uc< eed
ing Congresses demand their books of the same kind"  M B
denounced the whole ¡proceeding as the most extraoidmaiy
piece of extiavagance that was ever imposed on the Govern
ment or the people The original proposition had been pjohe 1
throughnooneknewhov and it wis, upon the whole, on<- of the
most wasteful pieces ofextiavagancc that ever c ime within his
knowledg , notwithstanding which, it appeared sail to be going
on, and th° object he had in view w js to p¡ace all the neeessiiy
imVmation b lore 'he Senate, in ordei that a check sh mid be
put to such procee linss Mr Ii said he had alwavs been op
posed to purchasing book1* for the use of members, and the
course he should feel hound to pursue would be to send back
the volume to the source tiom whence it wa^ der ved
Mr CALHOUN said he had a very general and indistinct re
collection of what had occurred heretofore on this subject
He rpmembered that his impressions were decidedly against
the whole affair, and he thought that no appropriation was
made All he had now to say, was that he had received a lettet
similar to that receiv* d by the Senator from Missouri, and that,
with his imoressions he could not íeceive the woik, but would
be compelled to return it
Mr KING siid that this wis a case which had occupied the
attention of the Senate seveial years ago It was certainly a
very extiaordm try arrangement of the ¡secretary ofStite under
which t ne work was fust commenced, and it turned out that
this contract would involve an expense that no man could esti
mate Million-might ho expended undei it before the) eon I
seethe end o*"it Ihe Senate took the matter up, andufencd
it to a committee, who reponed on it It wa^ then piopo&td
that the contract snould unik rgo i ie vision by t! e titLitUiry ol
State, foi he purpose of receiving pioposals from the contrac
tors to bring th" contract within some reasonable bounds \
proposition was «coidingly made by them, an 1 liter if a 1 vw
was passed to authou/c the continuation of the wotk to a cer
tarn extent
[Mr K here i<*ad the law, ai d explained the teims on which
the woik was allowed to be print* d ]
Mr K «aid that though he w is oí opmton that this contiact
was a tnost improper one in the beginning, md was in ule with
an intention to deceive, and though he and borne ol his friends
did all ihat they could to stop it, yet as Congit&s h id tatten the
mat'er up an 1 passed this 'aw they weic obliged to g i on with
K, unle«s some mode could be devised of getting nd of it with
out injury to the individuals fet us. (sail lie) pa> these men
liberally foi what they have done, and stop the evpetuhune
which they could not tell how fai it would extend I et us
<said he,) instead of buying the^e expensive works for om selves
out of the mon°v of the people, hoy them, if we must have
them, out of oul own money Mr K said he was opposed
now, as he had il ways been, to the pmchasme of books to be
given out to members of Congress, though he did not think the
measure now proposed was  tht light w ty to stop it
Mr DAMfe would not undertake to [ lonounce upon the me
rits of the piesent \ ilume because he did not know of what it
consisted but he haprened to see tome ot the sheets oí the
othei volume , and as a work of documentary histoiy, h+ would
say it Was inviUt ib e tnd v>ds a woik that could not hive
reached the public undei any n hei agencv th m that of the Go
v^rnment From h s knowledge of the ^enatoi ftom Miss< un,
he «houldcon der him deeply inteiested m the events ueated
of in these book* Ho did n  t ki ow what the origin d piocccd
ings WGre  he spoke only of tl e excellence of the wm!
Mr BENTON said that he did not know how he could anest
the distribution o-r this woik, till he co lid get the information
to enable the "senate to act His present application was ior
information and on that in foi mat ion, the Scntte would know
what to di \s to himself h & coiuse would be to send buk
the booi to the Sect clary of State
