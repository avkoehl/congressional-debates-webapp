roissioners, at £,4,500   when commanding Na\ y
yards, $4,000, on other duty, $3,750, on leave of
absence or waiting orders, f 3,000—being under
consideration,
Mi  PARKER moved to strike out the words,
"coast stitions, and when acting as Navy com
.    missioneis "
Mi WATMOUGH cxpiessed a fcivent hope
that the amendment would not be adopted The
whole bill, with its numerous amendments, had
been most elaboiately discussed in Committee of
the Whole, and he believed the sense of the House
had been fully elicited He did, theiefore, pai-
ticulaily desire that the time of the House should
not be wasted by fui ther useless argumentation
on points which might already be considered as
definitively settled
After a few woids from Mi PARKER, in ex
oulpation of the motives which induced he offer
of the amendment, and from Mr PIJNCTÍNEY,
in opposition to it, the motion was rejected, and
tbe amendment, as rcpoited to the House fiom
the Committee of the Whole, was concurred m
The next amendment—which fixes the pay of
master commandant, and commanders, when on
sea seivice, at $2,500 on otner duty, at $2,000,
and while waiting ordeis, a. $1,800—being under
consideiation,
Mi FILLMORE moved to amend it by insert-
ing, aftei the words, " waiting ordeis " tin woids,
' or on leave of absence," winch was agreed
to
Mr WATMOUGH said he hoped the amend-
ment agiced to in Committee of the Whole
would not be concurred in by the House, and on
the question being taken, the amendment was
rejected                
The amendment relating to lieutenants was next
concuried m, as follows
" Commanding, one thousand eight hundred
dollars, on other duty, one thousand five hundied
dollars, waning ordeis, one thousand two hund-
red dolíais "
Ths next two amendments concerning assistant
surgeons and suigeons, weie concuired in, after
a debate on tlu motion to add " pursers " to the
provisions made foi the suigeons
The amendment reads
Pursers—when attached to vessels for sea
service, or at navy ytids, $ 1,400 When on
leave of absence or waiting oidus, #900
Mr WISE asked for some information on the
subject of the amendment
Mr WATMOUGH then explained the reason
which had induced the committee to change the
picsent ngulations concerning puiseis Ho
stated that it had b on deemed expedient to
abolish the commissions of the purseis on tea
and sugar sold out to the sailors, and the addi-
tional salary to the puiser was gnen to compen-
sate him for his loss by this abolition of the
commissions
Mr WISE stated that the fixed pay of purseis
at present was veiy small, and that he had fifty
per cent on the tea, sugai, tobacco, &,c , which
amounted to some thousands, and a comirission of
twenty five pel cent onasecondaiy clas^of arti
clcs The ciptains, ilso, in consequence of then
insufficient pay, ait, fiequently obliged to boirow
money of thi puiseis He adveited to piactices
of pjiseis by which the sailois veic heavily
taxed Articles had been purchased a., Gibraltai,
and, aftei the vessi 1 hid gone to sea, the sailois
are compelled to iecene these ameles at double
their cost, and as specie He estimated the
annual profit of a pursei on boaid a seventy four
at ^,14,000 He said he hoped the amendment
would not bo concurred in, although the puisei
now received foui times as much is a captain,
because he thought the íegulation of then pay
should be made the subject of a separate act
Mr PEARCE made a few rcmaiks on the
unceitainty of the passage of the bill ipferied to,
and opposed the amendment
Mi PARKER hoped the House would reject
the amendment, and lemaiked that the gentleman
from Pennsylvania had, last session, introduced
a bill undu which he now admitted that the
pursers had been diawing four dolíais a month
fiom the pool seimen He wished that there
should be no mcieise of the pay of the puiseis
Mi  WAYNE thou¿ht that the clause should
be stiicktn out, and regietted that he must sep-
arate fiom the chaumin on this question
Mi WATMOUGH said, th it it was the ob
ject of the piovision to stuke at these evils if
they existed He did not desne to mcieasc, but
he did des íe to bring down the pay of the pur
seis, and he had desired to make the bill specific
on this point
Mi WAYNE said he should piobablyvote
to reduce the pay of the puiseis at a piooei time,
for he desued that it should be regulated
The House then refused to concui in the
amendment

eied and agieed to

On the question of concurring with the last of
the foregoing ame ldments, a debate ensued on
a motion of Mi Rled, to amend it by stuking
out ohe woid " sixteen," and inserting " ten "
Mr WARDmovedtomsert the word" twelve,"
and it was accepteu as a modification
Mr FILLMORE moved to strike out the allow-
ance "foi detention and employment on special
service." He stated that if the officer was net
paid enough for his whole time, the pay should
be increased
Mi WATMOUGH explained, that an officer
was fiequently tiansfeired fiom one place to
anothci, at an additional charge to himself, and
it was to compensate him for that that the pro-
vision was mtioduced
Mi MeKTNLEY was opposed to leaving a
discretion in the hands of any Department on a
subject which might lead to favoutism
Mi REED referred to the usages of the De-
partment These captain" were sometimes taken
from their stations and placed on other duties,
at gieat additional expense, and it has been usual
for the Depaitment to give extra allowance of
from one to thite dolíais a day He was de-
sirous to cut off all extia allowances
Mi VANDERPOEL said, it was well kno\vn
that he was fnendly to the increase of the pay
of the naval officers, and it was in that spiut of
friendship that he should vote for the motion of
his colLague to stuke out the clause under con-
sideiation He was against all extra allow mees
foi special duties He had icgardtd it as one of
thcgieatest merits of the bill under discussion,
that it was simple and peispicuous—that itcalled
things by then light names—and paid the officeis
specific sums pei annum, and no more He was
opposed to et cateras, contingencies, and extra
allowances The pimciple was wiong, and was,
as he could ha\e hoped, inconsistent with the
spirit m which this bill was conceived, viz a de-
sire to make such provision for tne nai al officers
as that the people should always know and under-
stand exactly what then servants received If
we paid tin m libeially per yeai, which ho was
ceitamly willing to do—if we paid them liberally
when waiting oideis, thtv ought not to consider
it a haidship to be put, pel haps once in the course
of their lives, on couits maitial, or to be detailed
foi some other special duty, without íeceiving
for it extia íemuneíaüon He must confess that
the amounts included in the bill should exclude
all extia claims for what aie denominated "spe-
cial duties " He was willing to allow them ten
cents pei mile for their ti ave ling fees, when they
went to and returned fiom thepointwhoj-e "such
special service" was to be executed, but he was
opposed to any per diem allowance at the same
time that their annual salary was going on
Mr MANN alluded to the scale of allowances
made in the Aimy when officeis weie sent on
journeys to inspect provisions, &,c He thought
the allowance ought to be fixed on the same scale,
and should vote against the motion
Mi WAYNE was m favor of retaining tins
pa-t of the amendment, as he wished to make
the extra allowance adequate to the service to be
peifoimed If the offieei weie sent on his own
expense on a seivice which requued expenditure,
he would be induced to shoiten the penod of
employment, although tlit public seivice might
theieby be injured
Mi MASON, of Virginia, suggested that the
better way would be to amend the clause by in-
serting the words, "whenabsent on couits mar-
tial," instead of striking out, as pioposed
Mi  BROWN said it was not his purpose to
inteiftre in any manner with the details of the
bill  undei considtiation, and  he should  leave
the dirangement of its piovisions to those better
qualified than himself foi  the examination of
such questions      His honorable colleague [Mi
FiLLMORt] who had submitted the amendment,
and his honorable colleague [Mi   Vanderpoei ]
who so earnestly advocated its adoption, were at
i a loss to know  what the nature of the  special
I services were for which provision was made in
I the bill     There was a single instance in Ins
J memoiy, (a trifling one, it is true,) which might
