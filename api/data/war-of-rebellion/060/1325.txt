his route. Active and daring scouts pushed far to the front will give notice enough to secure concentration if he advances in strong force. If the troops at Princeton should be threatened by too strong a force before you can assist them they must move toward Narrows or Rocky Gap, according to circumstances. Some force must be left at the Narrows in any case. The completion of the road up Wolf Creek at once is very important.

The enemy occupies a position from which roads lead in every direction to our numerous assailable points, each of which is expected to be defended, but you know the inherent difficulties of our position as well as I do. We must trust to the earliest intelligence and then to the promptness movements.

Breadstuffs and forage are procured in small quantities and with extreme difficulty. Employ the utmost economy, and if practicable reduce the forage ration and use grass.

I am, colonel, respectfully and truly,

JNO. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS KINSTON MILITARY DISTRICT,Kinston, N. C., April 28, 1864.

Colonel JOHN N. WHITFORD,

Commanding Sixty-seventh North Carolina Regiment:

COLONEL: Brigadier General W. S. Walker, commanding, thinks the movement suggested by you would be a good one, but General Hoke is aware of your position and has the sole control of the troops in the operations about Washington. It is presumed he has made arrangements for cutting off the enemy on the road to New Berne, and that your command may be required for other purposes. Hold yourself in readiness and await orders. If practicable, put yourself in communication with General Hoke and suggest the advance of your command to a point where it will be available in cutting the line of the enemy's retreat and can be securely withdrawn to your present post.

I am, colonel, yours, very respectfully,

JAMES LOWNDES,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
