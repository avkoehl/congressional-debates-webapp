WHITESIDE'S, January 27, 1864.

General WHIPPLE:

I arrived here this morning. Colonel Grose's brigade will reach Lookout Valley this evening. Cruft will be 3 miles toward Chattanooga from this. The Third Brigade will get to this point. the road is the worst I ever saw, and it is with the greatest difficultly we can get our wagons and cannon over it. I will try and reach Chattanooga to-morrow.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

PULASKI, January 27, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER:

I send my mounted force into Colbert reserve to-morrow. We must get those men out of there. Will you have that infantry down so as to cover the junction? Also, cannot Colonel Biggs, at Mooresville, send a few companies down to Brown's Ferry to watch that front while my men are gone? If the Third U. S. Cavalry could move to Athens to stay there three or four days until Phillips returns it would secure that point.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. SPENCER, Athens:

I think that all the mounted force we can raise should move immediately into Colbert Reserve and clean out the enemy. It will not do for us to let them remain there. Two regiments of infantry are on their way to the junction of the railroad south of Athens, and they will not cross again right off. The ferries can be picketed while the force is absent. Did Phillips and Sheldon meet the enemy? How strong does Colonel Miller say they are, and whose command?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. SPENCER, Athens:

I desire to know what force there is at Florence and Colbert Reserve. It appears to me taht the fight there indicates a strong force in that direction. If the report that Major Park sent up, that there two regiments opposite Mooresville, is true, it indicates a large force south of the river; and if Corinth is evacuated it leaves General Forrest at liberty to operate on us. I will try to leave six or eight companies of the Eighteenth Missouri with Phillips. He must watch all fords close. It appears to me that Phillips, Sheldon, Miller, and the U. S. Cavalry should move to Colbert Reserve and whip out the enemy.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
