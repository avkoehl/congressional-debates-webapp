CULPEPER COURT-HOUSE,

August 9, 1862-8 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

The enemy has advanced in heavy force to Madison Court-House, and seems to be advancing toward Robertson's River. He has also advanced a heavy column from Barnett's Ford to Robertson's River, at the month of Crooked River. He evidently designs an assault on my right. My whole force is concentrated between Culpeper and the point where the turnpike from Culpeper to Sperryville crossed Hazel River. I shall throw my train on the plank road from Culpeper to Fredericksburg, and watch the opportunity to attack him in the flank in case he continues to advance on the Madison and Sperryville road. I will keep you advised.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General POPE:

Your dispatch of last night has just come to hand, the line having been down for twenty-four hours. I will immediately issue orders for the movement of my division. Two brigades, with a battery, will start this afternoon, and the other two, with another battery and the cavalry, early to-morrow morning. We will push on as rapidly as possible.

General RUFUS KING:

What road are you taking in your march to this point? I think the first two brigades had better march as far as possible to-night. I have some suspicion that the enemy are extending on my left to cut you off.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

FALMOUTH, August 9, 1862-7 p. m.

Major-General POPE, Culpeper:

Yours just received. Two brigades and a battery have started by the road from Fredericksburg to Ely's Ford and thence to Culpeper. The other two, with artillery and cavalry, move at 4 a. m. up this side of the river to Barnett's Ford, crossing the Rappahannock there and uniting with the other column on the Neck. We will move with all possible dispatch.
