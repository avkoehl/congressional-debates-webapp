terday at the White House will relieve Wilson of any apprehension of being disturbed, and I trust Sheridan will keep Hampton occupied. I don t think Sheridan will have much chance of getting to Deep Botton bridge in the face of Hampton unless he is able to give him a severe and serious defeat. Wilson will be instructed when at the junction to endeavor to communicate with Hunter near Lynchburg. The junction is about half way between this point and Lynchburg. If Sheridan were here there would be no doubt, I think, of he and Wilson going to Lynchburg. Do you wish to send any instructions to Hunter by Wilson?
