MISSIONARY RIDGE,

November 26, 1863-1.30 p.m.

Bragg is in full retreat, burning his depots and bridges. The Chickamauga Valley, for a distance of 10 miles, is full of the fires lighted in his flight.

CHATTANOOGA, November 27, 1863-10 a.m.

Sherman yesterday captured two 32-pounder rifle guns at Chickamauga Station, and Palmer three guns at Graysville. Bragg burned vast quantity of corn at Chickamauga Station, but left much unburned; also much meal. Jeff C. Davis had brisk fight for a rebel wagon train just before dusk last evening; result unknown. Sherman will to-day occupy Red Clay Station, on Dalton and Cleveland Railroad, cutting off Longstreet on that line. Hooker advances upon Ringgold by the direct road from Rossville. Our losses in the battle in killed will not exceed 500, nor wounded and missing 2,500. Wood's and Sheridan's divisions, Fourth Corps, returned to Chattanooga last evening, preparatory to marching up the Tennessee, but doubtful whether the movement will be made, Sherman's occupation of railroad being most probably sufficient to compel Longstreet's retreat from East Tennessee. Three regiments, cavalry and mounted infantry, under Colonel Long, crossed Tennessee by Sherman's bridge on the 24th, to do all possible damage in Bragg's rear. Burned Tyner's Station same night; not heard from since. All of Thomas' cavalry ordered to Kingston, via Sparta; be there by 30th. Our number of prisoners captured will be fully 5,000. Many were taken yesterday.

RINGGOLD, November 28, 1863-8 a.m.

Yesterday the first great fault in this admirable campaign occurred at this place. General Hooker arrived here about 9 a.m. with Geary's division, Twelfth Corps, Osterhaus' division of Sherman's army, lately commanded by Woods, and two divisions Fourteenth Corps, under Palmer. The enemy were drawn up in the narrow gorge where the railroad passes between Taylor's Ridge on the right and White Oak Ridge on the left, the two ridges being, in fact, but parts of the same range of hills. It was a very dangerous defile to attack in front, and common sense plainly dictated that it should be turned. This could be done without difficulty by way of White Oak Ridge, which can be passed with ease in many places, while Taylor's Ridge is steeper, though infinitely easier to go over, than Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga. However, Hooker attacked in front, and the result was officially reported by him last night in the loss of 500 killed and wounded, where there was no necessity of losing 50. Having been
