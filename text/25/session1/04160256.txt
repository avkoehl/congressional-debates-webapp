In the Howe of Representa!111% 'septem >/i 26 1837—
On the bill to postpone the iouuh ms almcnt of
deposite w ith the ¡states
The house having resolv ed itself into a Com-
mittee of the Whole, and lesumed the consideia
tion of the bi 1 from the Senate to defer indefinitely
the payment to the States ot the lourth instilment
(89,307 214 98 ) to become dm. on tin 1st ol Otto

Mr MERCUR aiose and idchcssed Uk. com
mittee in substance as follows
Our da)S, Mi Ghainmn are numbered The
refusal oí the house, this morning, to la) on the
table the resolution oi the Senate to adjourn on the
9th of October, and the bare majority b) which the
committee consented to rise, at a very late hour list
night, admonish me of the extreme inxietv •which
exists to close this discussion It js with no little
embana«sment theitloie, that I -venture to adcliess
the committee.
I am, Mr Chanman, of Hie-\ ears, (said Mi M )
unused to debate My labois in tins house have
long been confined to the humlk pith ol legish
tion presuibed to me by the allotment oí its com
nuttees Content to aid in the development of the
resources by means ed the internal improvement oí
our common country, I have studious!) avoided
mingling in the suite of ¡ auj, that I might more
successfully promo e those peeuhai inteiests con
fided, m some small degiee   to mj charge
For ¡en veais I have not p it pen to papel w itli a
view to lepoit any sptee1 of nunc and have irisen
in debate onlv vv hen lmoclWl bv the hope how evei
grounlless, of shedding some light on the question
to be decided As 1 cannot speak to empty ehaus
and find a sufficient íeward in the circuí mon at
hoiie of what I utter here, it is the more nece ssarj
that I should have join attention though I may
fail to 1 tpav ¡t
That I imj not, however foift.it all title to vi nr
indulgence, 1 will pi ocetd without fuithci apologv
to examine die vai 10 is 1 reasurj estima es v Inch
furnish the basis ol the bill on-join table
How little 1 chance is to be placed on these esu
mates is mpe'e mamlest not on]} b} the conflicting
results vv th legard to the present state of om Í?
nances which have been deduced from the Secre
íkry s first elaboiate report bj the various gentle
men who have prec 'ed me but by a palpable mis
statement m the veiy bnef aisvvei letumed inthe
last week toa  pc< ial mqmiv of the house
Taking tnem collectivelv I am compelled to re
gard the repor s of this ofimer duunp the present
session, whenevei inielhg-ible as alike defective
erroneous, and inconsistent w ith each other
In that which immcdiatelv followed the Piesi
dent's message, no information is aftoided to this
house oí the final settlement vvh ch bv one of the
last acts of the twenty-fourth Congress he was em
powered to make with the Bank of the United
Sates The entue resources of the Treasury to
meet the expenses of the last half oí the current
year are wrapped up m an obscure paragraph of
this report, which furnishes, as the result e>f his es
tímate, nine millions and a half without disclosing
the sources from whence this sum is expected to be
drawn
We now discover from the answer returned to a
special inquiry of this house that the Secretaty
disposed of the Government stock m the Bank of
the United States for near eight millions of dollars,
and holds the bonds of that institution for this
amount, payable, w ith interest from the third of
March, 1836, m four equal annual instalments of
$1 986,539 04 The time of payment is the month
of September of the present, and of each of the
three succeeding years The rate of mtei est to be
paid is not furnished by the Secretar) but on per-
sonal application at the Treasur), I learnt that it is
six per cent
The first instalment, therefore, vv ill, on the del of
next month, equal $2,175,260 24
But of the whole consideration receivable from
thebank,theSecietary apprizes usthat "$741,561 28
is on account of the navy pension fund,' and has,
to use his ovv n language, " partly been paid, and the
íesidue will be out of the first instalment 11 ken re
ce ved It is a portion " he adds, ' of a liust finia,
and not applicable to general purposes " So that
the sum of the first instalment applicable to public
use, would seem to be but $1,363,250 64
In the last Tieasurv estimate, however, that of the
21st of this month, this sum is carried to the credit
of the unexpired year, as about a million anda
haK" Why it is raised to that amount if as we
are evpressly told, the sum of $741,561 the whole
interest of the navy pension fund it, to be paid out
of the first instalment received fiom the bank, or
whence the obligation arises to make so large a de-
duction on account of this fund, we are left to con-
lectnre A word or two as to the lustorv of this
fund When it amounted to $656 000, the present
clnnman ot the Ce)mmittee of Ways and Means
proposed, with a view to itsenlaigement, to peimit
by law, its investment in a part of the Government
bank stock at par, the stock being then fifteen per
cent abov e par The humane purpose of the fund
to provide for the destitute w idows and eirphans of
deeeasee! naval officers, out of whose pay the funel
had been reserved, piompted the hou«eto acquiesce
mthis piopo«al
Having, at the commencement of this session,
looked to the United States bank stock held by the
Government as an available and appropriate te-
source m the present condition of the Treasmyand
of the currency of the country, I applied to the
Tieasurv office and there leatnt that 6 416 shares
oí 68 752 ihe lesidue of 70 000 ongmallv held by
the United States belonged to the nav) pension
fund that a sale of the whole stock had been made
to the new Bank of the United States on the 4th of
March last, at a piemium of $15 5S per c ent and
four bonds of equal amount received in payment
lhe sale, thus effected wa  obviously for the
mutual benefit of the United States and the navy
pension fund The consideration was common and
uniform, and the claimants became entitled to a
ratable proportion of the several bonds, the navv
pension fund to a share of the first bond eqm/alent
to eme fourth pait of its entire mteiest m the whole
consideration
Instead of $711 561 29 this fund is therefore
entitled to claim ontof the fust instalment due from
the hank $185 390 32, which with 19 months'
mlerest will amount on the 3d of October to
$203 003 40 Deductmgthis sum from Í 3 175 260 24
and the balance ot ti e fust instalment to be carried
to the credit of the Treasury will be on the 3d ol
October next, $1 972 257 81, instead oí a million
and a half at which it w as estimated by the chau
man of the Committee of Wavs and Means or the
sum of $1 363 250 64 to which the Secretaiy would
s< em to 1 educe it by his lettei of a subse quent date
By such reduction, his last estimate excludes the
sum of $609 007 20 irom the resources of the fourth
quarter of this vear, while 1 continues to omit an)
allusion whatever to the aid which the Treastrn
might denv e 111 its present exigenc), from an inti
cipation byloanorotheivvise of the payment of the
tl ree remaining bonds of the bank, amounting in
principal to very near six millions and with the
accruing interest, to a much larger sum
Thatth s omission has resulted from no desne to
favor the credit of the Bank of the United States by
withholding its bond from market, will be readily
conceded by all who know the hostility of the Sec-
retary to that institution To what, then, can it be
imputed but to the design manifest upon the face
of all the estimates of this officer, by ehmimshmg
the resources of the Treasury, to create an apparent
necessity for passing the bill on our table 1
Further and stronger evidence of such intention
will be found by comparing a very short paragraph
oi his first report with the facts subsequently dis-
closed by a letter of the Tieasurer and a printed
document transmitted to this house, lrom the Sen-
ate, but a few days ago
After apprizing us that the public expenditures
will exceed the balance remaining in the Treasury
on the first of January last, together with the lt-
venue of the current year, by near six millions,
($5,875,565,) "morder," says the report "to dis-
charge that excess and retain of the mone) reserv-
ed on the first of January, one million, which is the
smallest sum deemed proper under the acts of Congress
for the efficient opeiations of the Mint, and at least
three or font million mo/e, to answer sudden and
contingent calls, theie w ill probably be a necessity
to resort to the deposites note with ike States, and to
the deposites destined for them m October, or to some
other montee, for a sum equal to ten millions"
Allow me to say, Mr Chairman that among the
manv deceptive estimates of the Secretary there is
not one moie extraordinary or culpable than ihis
The " acts of Congress, to which the Seer tary
alludes, arc comprised in the 31st section oí the act
of the 18th of January last, (<z) Companng this
paragraph with the provisions ol the act, it is obv 1-
ous that the Seeietary assumes the largest sum
which the law permits him to emploj m the opera-
tions of the Mint, ' as the smallest deemed proper
iindet those acts," to use his own language The
maximum extent of his discretion he thus makes
the minimum, disregarding alike the express re-
ference of the law to the convenience he Trea-
sur) the authority as expressly givei uto with-
draw the whole deposite or any part 01 i<, and the
alternative lelt at his eiscietion, of exchanging,
from time to time, com for bullion, as had been the
successful practice of the Mint for a series of years
It becomes us next to inquire how the authority
of the Secretary over this million has been exer
used, and to mfei from its past, its future use,
should it be again inti usted to his discretion
From a letter of the Treasurer, w hich accom-
panied the Secretary's letter to the house, of the 15th
instant, it appears that there had been deposited in
the Mint, on the 1st of May, one million of dollars,
and that, on the 13th of the present month, there
yet remained, of this sum, §776,535, the residue of
the million hav ing been recently withdiawn
Turning to the statement furnished by the Sen-
ate, of the operation  oí the Mint since the 1st of
Januar) last, we have, foi the fiuit of the first eight
months of the veai, a gold coinage of the value of
$853,825 The least sum coined m any two
months subsequent to Januar) last falls short of
$41,000 a month The greatest product of any one
month, that of May, is $-268,000, while the average
monthly coinage oi the w hole period is less than
$107,000 and does not, during the last three months,
exceed $87,000 So that, 111 v ntue of a discretion-
ary power carefully guarded by law, to employ,
iif expedient a sum " not to exceed a million,'
the Seeietaiy has actually employed that amount
mavam a tempt to add $107 000 a morth to the
gold ce m of the country He has pushed his au-
thority to its utmost limit, while 'he fact was star-
ing him ir t> e face, as his íeport ad -> •, that, (b)
as fast as the gold received the impress of the die,
it passed abroad, to be again converted nto bullion,
fot the payment of a part of that foreign debt, to
the pressure of which upon our currency, and,
through it, upon the banks, the Secretaiy justly as-
cribes the derangement of the former and the in-
solvency of the latfer
I need scarcelj r«mmd the committee that the
coinage of gold does not augment its exportable
value noi need I remark how inadequate is the
seigniorage charged for that coinage at the tardy
rate of 087,000 a month, to reimburse the ordinary
expend oí the Mint, and the interest of the mil-
lion abstracted fiom an embana«sed Tieasury Is
it not, therefore most extraordinary, tl at the Secre-
tar) of the 1 reasury, with the experience of eight
months, should ask of us a million of elollar , for
the purpose of repeating so losing a game1 Is this
committee prepared to grant it* Will they not
rather restrain than accelerate an opeiation «o ex-
trava^ant, by requiring this officer to apply th^ r
