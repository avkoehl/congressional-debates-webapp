PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Mr. DOUGLAS. I rise, Mr. President, for the
purpose of saying a single word in explanation. I
stated yesterday that the Rev. Mr. Richardson,
from whose sermon 1 then quoted, was a Connecti-
cut man, as I believed. J have received a note
to-day, from a member of his congregation, who
happens to be in the city, stating that he is a Ken-
I tuckian, and not from Connecticut. He says Dr.
Richardson came from -Kentucky to him with a
letter of introduction from an eminent Kentuokian,
that he was present and heard that sermon deliv-
ered, and left the church because of its delivery on
the Sabbath day. I make this correction by the
authority of one of Mr. Richardson's congrega-
tion.
Mr. TOUCEY. I am very glad the Senator
has made the correction.
DAVrD MYERLE.
Mr. GWIN. I move that the Senate take up
for consideration the bill for the relief of David
Myerle. It was objected to on Friday last by a
single Senator, and was passed over.
1 he motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to the con-
sideration of the bill.
This case has been eight years before Congress,
and has several times passed the House of Repre-
sentatives, and been favorably reported on in the
Senate. It appears that, previous to the year 1840,
the memorialist had been long and extensively
engaged in the manufacture of cordage; and was
possessed of much useful knowledge on the sub-
ject of the growth, preparation, and manufacture
of hemp. It had long been considered an object
of the highest national importance, and as vitally
essential to our true independence of other nations
for one of the most important elements of national
defense, to introduce and establish the praticability
and safety of the process of water-rotting hemp in
the hemp-growing regions of the United States,
for the supply of its Navy and commercial marine.
It is claimed that Mr. Paulding, then Secretary
of the Navy, urged the memorialist to abandon
the business in which he was engaged, and to
enter upon the expeiimentof water-rotting hemp.
The patronage of the Government was tendered
to him, with the most liberal promises of encour-
agement and indemnity against loss, and if suc-
cessful, of the most generous reward from the
Government. He embarked in the business, and
hence his claim against the Government.
The PRESIDENT. There is an amendment
pending to this bill, and the question is on that
amendment, to strike out " $30,000," and insert
"$10,000."
Mr. GWIN. Who was it moved by ?
The PRESIDENT. The Senator from South
Carolina, [Mr. Evans,] who is now absent.
Mr. CHASE. I do not see the Senator from
South Carolina in his place. Probably he wishes
to address the Senate on the subject, or, at all
events, desires to be present when the bill is taken
up and acted upon. It seems to me the usual
courtesy requires it to be postponed until he shall
be present. A majority can take it up atany time.
Mr. GWIN. I am not aware that the Senator
desired to discuss the bill. It has been before
Congress for a long time. I hope the bill will be
disposed of now, one way or the other. I have
not a word to say about it. I think the reading
of the report will show clearly the equity of the
claim.
Mr. DAWSON. The Senator from South
Carolina, [Mr. Evans,] on Friday,consented that
the bill might be taken up, if he could be heard on
his amendment.
Mr. BADGER. Oh, no.
Mr. TOOMBS. Yes, sir; I so understood him.
Mr. BADGER. He said he would agree to
take up the bill on condition that the Senate should
adopt his amendment.
Mr. DAWSON. That amendment was to
reduce the amount from $30,000 to $10,000. That
Senator is not now in his seat; of course he did
not expect that the question would come up this
morning. I hope my friend from California will
consent to wait until, at least, he can be heard
upon that amendment.
Mr. GWIN. This question has been before
Congress for many years. The bill has been re-
ported from the Committee on Naval Affairs, and
is well understood, I presume, by the members
of this body. I think we can take the vote on
the proposition. There are others opposed to the
claim besides the Senator from South Carolina;
and we can take the vote in lus absence. If the
Senate agree to the amendment, and pass the bill
in that form, I shall not object. I am against the
amendment, but 1 wish to have it acted upon.
Mr. DAWSON. It isa mere matter of courtesy
on which I appeal to my friend from California.
