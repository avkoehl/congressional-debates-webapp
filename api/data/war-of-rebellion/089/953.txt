possibly, in our rear up the Weldon road, as of course, on Warren's withdrawing, if he does not follow him, he will try to play the same game I am proposing, viz, to strike our weakened lines before lines before Warren can get back. It will therefore be necessary that Warren should be close up to us before it will be prudent for us to attempt the offensive from the front.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I transmit dispatch* just received from Major-General Warren. I understand from the officer who brings it that no opposition was met, except from cavalry, till they reached Hicksford, where artillery was found in position on the other side of the Meherrin. On the return the cavalry met some infantry near Jarratt's, but no great force. From all I can gather, Hill either did not leave Dinwiddie or else pushed for Hicksford, thinking Weldon was Warren's objective.
