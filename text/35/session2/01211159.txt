Mr. KELSEY. How does that bill come here?
Is it a privileged question?
The SPEAKER. The select committee of the
last session reported that bill, under the resolution
authorizing the appointment of the committee;
the House gave them liberty to report at any time.
The privilege to report at any time, involves the
privilege to call up the bill at any timeT
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. When the bill is
open to amendment, I want to move that the sal-
ary of the superintendent be reduced from $2,500
to $2,000, for $2,500 is a larger salary than is
paid to any officer, except the Clerk of the House
of Representatives.
Mr. MORGAN. The present salary is $1,500.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I am willing to
put it at that.
Mr. HUGHES. Th<! select committee which
reported this bill was appointed at the last ses-
sion, under a resolution, to inquire into the ac-
counts and official conduct of the Doorkeeper.
Their powers were afterwards enlarged, by a res-
olution of the House, so as to include the then
Doorkeeper; and subsequently their powers were
enlarged so as to include an inquiry into any abuses,
affecting the publication or sale of books printed by
authority of the House of Representatives. The
committee examined a good many witnesses, and
the resolution and bill here reported are the result
of that investigation. This report was made some
time in May last; and I have permitted it to lie
till the present time because the press of public
business was such that no suitable opportunity
for action upon it occurred. It is now-within a
few days of the end of the session, and I have felt
it to be my duty, as the chairman of that commit-
tee, to call the matter up and let the House dis-
pose of it in such manner as they may deem
proper. 1 do not wish, Mr. Speaker, to occupy
the time of the House with this matter; and if
there be no disposition to debate it, I will, after
such amendments as gentlemen think proper to
propose, ask the previous question. I would in-
quire if the question will not he first on the reso-
lution reported by the committee, that it may be
disposed of before the bill is acted on f
The SPEAKER. The House has already got
the bill before it; and it must be disposed of first.
Mr. CRA1GE, of North Carolina. Is it in
order to move to lay the bill on the table?
The SPEAKER. When the gentleman from
Indiana yields the floor, it will be m order.
Mr. CRA1GE, of North Carolina. The House
has not got time now to consider this matter.
Mr. HUGHES. As the gentleman from North
Carolina indicates a disposition to move to lay the
bill on the table, I wish simply to say, before
yielding the floor, that I hope the House will not
make that dispWsitibn of the bill. I think it is a
very important measure, and one which intro-
duces some wholesome restrictions. *
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I ask the
gentleman if this measure meets the unanimous
approbation of his cotamittee ?
Mr. HUGHES. Ye's, sir, it does.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I now move the
amendment which I suggestedâ€”ti> strike out
$2,500 and insert $1,500; so that the section will
read;
That there shall be appointed by the House of Represent-
atives a superintendent of the folding-room, who shall bold
his office for the same term as the Sergeant-at-Arms, and
sliaii give a bond in the same penalty,-and to be approved
in like manner as the bond of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and
who uhall receive for all services an annual salary of $1,500.
Mr. MORGAN. That is the present salary*.
Mr. HUGHES. Before moving the previous
question, 1 would state that we propose to place
considerable responsibilities on the superintend-
ent to be elected under this bill, which do not
now rest on the superintendent. The present
superintendent is a mere subordinate to the Door-
keeper of the House; but we propose to make the
superintendent an elective officer; to place re-
sponsibilities upon him, and require him to give
a heavy bond and security. I think the salary
proposed is not too large.
Mr. MORGAN. I never knew a bond to
amount to anything. J
Mr. RUFFIN. This bill authorizes the super-
intendent to employ folders not exceeding ten in
number. I want to know whether the messen-
gers of the House now authorized by law are
to be kept during the recess of Congress, without
any work to do, and drawing their pay? Under
the present management, the Doorkeeper turns
over his messengers, after the adjournment of
Congress, to the superintendent of the folding-
riom.
Mr. HUGHES. The gentleman from North
Carolina rriisapprehends the provisions of the
bill. The bill provides that the superintendent
of the folding-room, and not the Doorkeeper, may
employ not exceeding ten folders.
Mr. RUFFIN. During the recess he is allowed
ten'folders.
Mr. HUGHES. The messengers employed
by the Doorkeeper, in the discharge of his dutiea
proper, are not affected by this bill at all. This
bill relates exclusively to the folding-room.
Mr. RUFFIN. That is exactly my under-
standing. The Doorkeeper of the House keeps
ten or twelve men during the whole recess,draw-
ing a salary. 1 believe the House decided, the
other day, that the resolution passed at the last
session amounts to nothing, and that the Door-
keeper's messengers are entitled to the full pay
allowed under the law. Under this bill, these
messengers will have nothing to do during the
recess, and will draw their pay from the Govern-
ment.
Mr. HUGHES. This bill does notaffect that
force at all.
Mr. RUFPIN. That is exactly what I said.
That is the reason I complain of it.
Mr. HUGHES. I call the attention of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina to the section of the
bill which gives to the superintendent of the fold-
ing-room the power to appoint his own messen-
gers.
Mr. RUFFIN. That is exactly what I com-
plain of. The superintendent is allowed to ap-
point his own messengers, while the Doorkeeper
is still authorized, under the present law, to have
his permanent messengers here during the recess
of Congress, Unless you repeal the law, there
will be, from the 4th of March to the 1st of De-
cember next, some ten or a dozen men in the em-
ployment of the Doorkeeper who have nothing
to do.
Mr. KELSEY. Has the previous question
been called?
The SPEAKER. The Chair does not know
whether it has or not.
Mr. KELSEY. Then I move to lay the bill
on the table.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Indi-
ana has the floor.
Mr. HUGHES. The gentleman from North
Carolina totally misapprehends the-matter. The
committee have only attempted to reform the fold-
ing-room department; and is it any objection to
that measure that the reform has not been ex-
tended to matters not submitted to th'e cbmmit-
