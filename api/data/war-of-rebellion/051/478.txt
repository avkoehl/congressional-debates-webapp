And 1 wagon load of accouterments.

I have also to enumerate 3 brass 12-pounder cannon, 3 caissons for 12-pounder cannon, captured on the field on Sunday evening by this brigade, as mentioned in this report, 1 of which was hauled to the rear by Lieutenant Everett, commanding my battery, attached. I would also state that 1 of above guns was manned by men (artillerists) from the Seventeenth and Twenty-third Tennessee Regiments, and used under direction of Lieutenant Dent with good effect on the enemy during the four hours' contest on Sunday evening.

I have also to mention Ordnance Sergt. J. F. Baxter, wounded on the field. This man is an untiring officer, and faithful to his trust.

The provost guard, under Lieutenants Ewing and Orr, rendered invaluable service.

I am pleased to notice the conduct of Private Turner Goodall, of the provost guard, who, in the thickest of the fight on Sunday evening, seeing the men all so gallantly at work and hard pressed, came up with his gun and fought manfully through the hottest of the fight, and by words of encouragement to his fellow soldiers and example did his whole duty as a soldier and provost guard.

The capture of prisoners by this brigade in the two day's fight exceeds 600 men and officers sent to the rear.

I would also mention Lieutenant Ewing, of the provost guard, from the Seventeenth Tennessee Regiment, who, finding that the officers of his company had all been placed hors de combat, asked permission and returned to take command of his command on Sunday morning. He is a worthy and promising officer.

I have to report the following articles captured from the enemy and secured by Dr. John W. Templeton for the use of the brigade:
