HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 2, 1864-11.45 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Our advance this a. m. found the enemy withdrawn from their position of last night. Parke and Warren are developing their position. From reports of signal officers I infer they have retired to their former and main line of works; if so, I shall take up a position, connect with the Weldon road, guard my left flank, and await attack, unless otherwise directed. The battery around the Jordan house, Numbers 4, requires a garrison of about 150 men and should be inclosed. Please have one detailed and let the work be done.
