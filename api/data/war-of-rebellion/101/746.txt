Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of January 27. I ordered the Second Missouri Cavalry to you. I found it was mostly dismounted, and as I was unable to get horses to mount it, and knowing your necessity for troops, I sent the mounted portion without waiting for the rest. Since then I find that one battalion is with General Canby, and the balance of the regiment has been, by his and General Halleck's orders, ordered to report to him as soon as horses are furnished it.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
