CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
ments which connected this movement with the pub-
lic press.   He would only ask Senators to pause
and consider how long it had been since (heir print-
ing had b^en performed by any other contractor
than the conductor of a partisan newspapei'  Cer-
tainly not since the passage of the  law of 1819.
And what were they then declaring?    That if their
Printers were the conductors of a partisan newspa-
per, they must "whisper" their opinions, as an
honorable Senator had said; and that they were
not to expre s them   boldly   and   like   freemen,
that    if   they  proclaimed    their    opinions    in
their   journal    or   newspaper, they   must meet
with dismissal from   Congress     Was not   that
the practical condition'!   And had they not,  then,
the right to turn to their opponents, and ask them
if they were authorized to expect this as the first
step of this Administration which was to annihilate
proscription''    He knew the paper spoken of had
been a warm political paper, he did not know that
it had been any more so than two others, and the
only two other prominent journals in this District
And he thought he did know that neither of the per-
sons connected with the Globe had ever commit-
ted, either as editors or as men, so flagrant  an
abuse of the Congress of the country, as another
editor had   committed   in a public   and   offk lal
speech, within a few days, in the sieets  of this
city    He would not now either read that speech
or comment upon it, but he mentioned it to show
that all editors were violent partisans, and that
whether writing for then newspapers,  or m their
official capacity, they v. nte with a freedom of lan-
guage sometimes not tolerated by truth     Could
they   restrain their licentiousness?   Should they,
silting ihere in that capacity, try?   In his opim >n
they should not    He had already 5aid he should
not discuss the question whether the Printer of the
Senate was an officer of the Senate, or a contractor
with the Senate, but this In, simply would say, that
the argument of an honorable Senator, made yes-
terday, based principally on Webster, did   not  sa.
tisfy his mind.  The honorab'e Senator had argued
that an election must produce an officer,  and the
Senator asked if any body  had ever heard of an
election of a contractor     Well,  if  the honoiable
Senator would  tell  him  (Mr   WriariT)  how he
could obtain a contractor for even his private busi
ness, withouta'i election be would answer tus argu-
ment.    He (Mr Wright) knew of no other \v<iy,
and he considered, so far as the honorable Sena-
tor's argument was concerned, that it was enough
to say that ihe choosing in. this ca e, or the election,
by the vote of the Senate, was merely the selection
of a man to perform that duty, and that instead of
imposing it on their Secretary to eltct a contractor,
as well as to make   the contract, the Senate cli< se
to designate the ndividual, kavin* their officer to
make the contract with  him    And this appeared
n be a proper use of the term    Webster said, to
"elect" was to • pick out, to select from among
two or more—to ¡.elect or take f >i an office 01 em-
ployment—to choose from  a nong a  number—to
select or manikst preference by vote or r tsigna-
tion "    And the definition of tho word "election"
in Webster, was, "t e act of choosing, choice, th 
act of selecting one 01 more  from others, the at t
of chcosmg a person  to filian  office or emfloy
ment by any  mamfeslati<n of preference as  by
ballot, uplifted hands,  or viva v ce, is  tho elec
non of a king, a president, ora iniyor
Ihey might as veil elect a man to do a jib of
work as to elect a Presider t of the United States,
it was only a mode of designating th* individual
whom they would put in charge of certain duties
They might desijnatt a person for a certain positio 1,
and cail him an office!, they might give him a
commission and rank, as in the case of a pursei in
the nary, mentionrd yesterday, in ano her case,
they might name the contractor to build their
house, or a post office, or a patent office, or todo
their printing He did not desire, however, to
protract this discussion, ni r was it necessary, for
lhis point had been argued 30 much more clearly
and ably than he could do it He wculd, then,
trouble them no longer than to s íy ihat bis purpose,
yesterday and to-day, had been simply to place be-
fore this body this subject as it had pie ented itself
U> his  own mind, and to call «pon ihem 10 *a
whether it was in conformity with what should be
understood to be the declarations of the President,
and whether it was in conformity with the protesta-
tions of the party, before they reached power.
And let him say to tho^e gentlemen, that we
(the late majority) might have done many things
wrong, but those gentleman would be wise not to
follow our bad example And yet we never de-
nied that we preferred to carry on the Govern-
ment, when in power, through the agency of our
political friend , than through that of our oppo-
nents. They did not repudiate doctrines of this
kind, they avowed the doctrines to the extent to
which they practised them But what was charged
upon them1 That they avowed them to the whole
extent Well, look at their practice, and he feared
some of the friends of the gentlemen opposite were
regretting that they had not gone further He
(Mr Wriüht) said this in no ill temper He had
found several of his acquaintances, on visiting this
city, were astonished to find such a number of offices
filled with what they considered ' good Whigs "
Yes, the prizes were infinitely diminished because
they had not pushed this doctrine farther They
(the late Administration) did not repudiate it, it
was the other side that did so, and he begged the
gentlemen opposite would not lead them into the
practice of a doctrina which those gentlemen had
themselves proscribed
Mr MANGUM spoke at length m support of
his resolution He denied that it was predicated
on the sole ground of political opinion, that had its
influence,but, in addition to that, there was a want
of personal confi lene  in the pi esent officers The
Printer of the Executive document of the body
must necessarily be informed of the progress of the
most delicate negotiation's, and by the infidelity of
the Printer, these negotiations might be broken off,
and this nation might be thrown into a war with a
foreign power It was necessarv, then, that they
should have an clficer in whom they could have
strict personal confidence, and not one whose pre
dilcction- were with an opposing party He had
no wish to depure any man of any legal right, but
lather than keep in these Printers, he would con
sent to pay $100,000, if awarded by a legal tribu-
nal The character of the Senate, the dignity <f
that body, their self-respec, and the public opinion
of the country, required that these men should walk
out of office
Mr SEVIER wa<- "not so soft" as to imigina
that any thing that he or those who acted with him,
could say on this subject, would prevent the passage
oí this resolution The thing was fixed, and he consi-
dered lhat sometime between this an 1 the first of
June, Blair and Rivts were to be dismissed from
being Public Prinleis, and he only rose, and he
supposed his friends had the sime intention, to tpar
the mask oft tne gentlemen opposite, «ho were
about to íllustiate their spirit of toleration, ot
which they had caid so much to the people It
now seemed that th< n tc 1-ra ion, and kindness, ?nd
forbearance, of which ihey nad been told during
the last three or four months was to turn out, as
he had ever believed it would turn out—a sheer
humbug, and he wi«hed it to be seen by the specta
tors and the country, that it lasted until the 4th of
Marco, and no longer A friend of his had this
morning read an extract from the Inaugural ad-
dic s He (Mr Sívier) had not had urn  to read
the who e of it, but he shou'd do so 0 1 board the
Meamboat on his return home He, however, lis-
tened to it and heard much f R me and As a "Vlinor,
and Scandimvia, and the Roma  Empirt, and he
know not what, I it he suould re«ume the
diseourve at the eaihcst opportunity They also
heard of forbearance and toleration, but who be-
lieved it' Who of the twenty thousand or thirty
thousand persons v ho heard it—half of whom were
office seekers—believed, tor a moment, that that for-
bearance and toleration were to be carried out into
practice1 He (Mr Sfvifr) had no fa th m tho-e
professions, nor of their reirerehment either They
bad alteady had one chapter under the head of re-
trenchment, in the election of a Sergeant-at-Arms,
who would have nothing to do but to re-
ceive his salary until the meeting of the next
Congress, and this was to be chapter one, under
the bead of reform    Now, he regretted that the
gentlemen did not come forward with manly bold-
ness, and say "the^e men must die, and we will be-
head them " They had the power, and that was
reason enough Why, the Senator from Sou h Ca-
rolina, [Mi Preston,) w ho had addressed them, had
talked about the joint resolution being a nuPity, and
he had said that of that resolution they had power
to disencumber themselves But did not that Se-
nator himself, in 1835, and perhaps before, too,
vote to elect Punters for this body before the 4th
of March' We'l, if it was unconstitutional now,
it was unconstitutional then, and why did not that
honorable Senat >r get up m h's place and object
to it? Why did he vote to sustain what was un-
constitutional' Did a change in the body from a
majority to a minority change the constitutionality
of that resolution'* No its constitutionality stood
the same, whpther the gentlemen were in a majori-
ty or minority. It had been very properly said
that this was a permanent body, and that the elec-
tion, whether before* the 4th of March or after, was
guod and valid It had been acquiesced in before,
as he found, on looking at the ayes and noes. It
had been the practice tor twenty odd years, and no
one ever disputed it before Why, in the other
House, in 1833 Gales and Seaton were elected with
ninety nine vo es, but, afterwards, a document was
published, signed by a hundred members, m which
they staled that they voted for Blair and Rives, and
yet Blair and Rives lost their election A new
election was claimed, on the ground that Gales and
S>aton had been chosen either by fraud or mis-
take, and what then was the cry from the "glori-
ous Whigs'" What did Gales and Seaton say'
Why, column upon column was written to show
that « hat was done by that bo ly was beyond the
reach of subsequent interference, and the election
was considered settled, when those Printers bad a
majority against ihem in that Congress.
But now, they were told it was indiscreet and
improper that Blair and Rives should be retained,
because they had confidential printing, and they
might betray the secrets of the body Well, if they
did, remove them, and he would vote foi it, but had
they not hithnrto punted confidential documents, and
was there a man there who could charge them wiih
having betrayed their trust? Would they prefer
giving the printing to a man to be selected by this
body, who, unable, to discharge his duties, having
neither types nor presses, should transfer their con
fidential printing to others who were not designated
by the Senate, and in whom the Senate might not
hive confidence' The thing had already been
done, and Allen of the Madwoman, when elected
Punter some time since, was obliged to transfer it
to Gales and Seaton
But one Senator had said that the mam object
was to remove Messrs- Blair and Rives Well,
go ahead and do 11, all he (Mr Se
viíB) wanted was that they should boldly avow
what they do Let them come forward like men,
and say it was their will and pleasure—let them
say it boldly, and do it like men, for such leasons
ss were given, contrary to the practice of years,
were lost on bim One Senator would remove
Blair and Rives, because, he alleged, they were
forced on ihem at ihe last moment He had no
doubt Blair and Rives were unaccep'able to those
gentlemen, but was that new? Were Gales and
Seaton acceptable to his side of the House in 1833
and 1835? No these things were the result of the
«CLidents of party warfare, which had always b* en,
and always would be, pcted on as long as this was
a Government He (Mr Ssvier) was one of those
who had helped to gag it down on those gentiemen,
ard he would do it again if he had the power But
he had risen merely to tell these galleries that
this cry about toleration was all humbug They
had already the whole matter illustrated in two
chapters—the one headed "Retrenchment," and the
other "Reform," and he wished the gentlemen to
takedown their false «ígn, and to put up a true
one.
Mr. WOODBURY observed, that at one time he
had not expected to take part m this debate. Most
of what he afterwards intended to say, had been
recently explained by others He should, there-
fore, crowd himself on the attention of the Senate
J  for only a few minute*, and on matters connected
