it for liquidation when they enter the Union.   The
ten per centum will probably be denied them, the
grant of land, equal to the Ohio grant, will also
probably be refused      Bat, no despair, and no
submission to this injustice    Ihe Democracy will

SPEECH OF MR. SMITH,
OF CONNECTICUT
In Senate, July 20, 1841— On the bill o incorpo-
rate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the
United States
Mr SMITH of Connecticut addressed the Se-
nate as follows
Mr President the Legislature of the State I
have the honor in part to represent, at its
last session, ppssed several resolutions, among
which was one upon the subject of a United
States Bank, or Fiscal Agent, now under
consideration before the Set ate, expressing a wish,
and requesting the S nators and Reprssen'atives
of the State in Congress, to support the bill by
giving their votes in favor of u I have thus far,
Mr President, ab tamed from taking any part in
the discussion of the bill, not on account of mv
disagreement with the Legislature of my State,
which my votes upon it would show without any
declaration of mine expressive of it, but because
I was conscious no shape could be given to it
which would meet my approbation I have al-
ways considered it a monster, fraught wi h evils,
and deadly hostile to our líbeme , and while I en-
tertain such an opinion of it, though it would be
gratifying to me to conform to the views of the Le
gislature of my State upon this, and all other -ub
jeets upon which I shall actas their representative,
still I shall consider it my duty to onpose it I
have no complaint to make of the re olution
passed by the Legi lature, it ha' a right to pass it,
and to request me to support the Bank, and it is
my right to support it or oppose it as mv judg
ment shall dictate I am aware, that an opinion
is maintained by many, that it is the dutv of the re-
presentative, m an elective Government, to strictly
obey mall instance! , tbmnstructu üs, when thev are
mandator/, of his constituents hi wever contrary
they may be to his judgments I think different!).
Tms body has been considered by manj, m its or-
ganization and political structure, aristocrat c, that
i>- not try v e v of it, I think it is democratic, ind
admirably calculated to equalize the rights ot die
States—to protect the weak against the strong—
the sma 1 against the large—the poor against the
wealthy If there could be uniformity of action
throughout the Union, and all would regar 1 in-
structions, and either obey or resign, the tendency
of such a course to fluctuation and instability, I
think, would not fail to be perceived, but snould
some regard ins ruct ons, and o'hers disregard
them, it is very clear that the equalizing power in
the Senate might be greatly wakened Whether
the term of six >eirs, ihe present tenure of the Se-
natorial office, be too long or too she rt, to harmo-
nize and move easily and consistently in our pc-
lical system, belongs to the sovereign peop'e to de-
termine My desgn,Mr President, is to occupy
what time the Senate sha'l mdu'ge me with, upon
the bill now under consideration, in discussing the
power of Congress to incorporate a banking com-
pany, and to locate it in any State or di tnct in
the Union, and of its power to repeal such chartei
and annul it at its pleasure, shou'd it be granted
I must, however, ask the further indulgence of the
Senate, while I can bn &y give my reasons for
disagreeing with the Legislature of my State, as to
the necessity of a Bank, and of i's utility in the
State of Connecticut, before I commence the dis-
cussion of that part of the subject which it was
my main purpose to do when I rose If another
Bgnk or national institution ¡s wanted m Connec-
ticut, it tnnsl be for some one or all of the follow-
ing purposes, I think, viz to aid the money
lender, or the b «rower—the brtker—exchanges,
or to act as a corrective and regulater of the State
institutions of the same charae'er
I think the Bank cannot be wan edm Connect cut
to accommodate either borrowers c lenders of mo
neyresid ngm that State If I remember ngh , the
report of the Cjmmi sioners of Banks to the last Le
gislaturt shows that between one and two Mllions
of the bank capital of that State m the List year
has been used out of the State If this is correct,
I am sure neither of th°se classes, borrowers or
lender?, can desire any more banking capital in
the State, having already much more than they can
use If an individual had mor1 than he could
lend, it would not be reasonable to suppove he
would invite oihersm to participa'e with him in that
which was already overdone by him Thi'is not
the way individuals or corporations conduct their
buuntss We have only to inform ourselves of
banking operations in the United Slates, and in the
different States, for a few years past, as they af
fected exchanges, to be satisfied that banks aie not
equalizers of exchanges, but, on the cui'rary, are
the main cause of their derangement. Exchanges
are mere balances of trade, and, leave thera to b°
governed by the laws of tra^e, and the merchant
will be benefited by carrying theproductsof one part
of the country to another, where tee balances ire, and
in that way the ba'ances will mamlj be adjusted
The farmer, the manufacturer, and the mechanic,
and all the laboring and industrious part ot com
mumty, will then participate in th  profits of ad-
justing the exchauges, and labor, in some measure,
will receive its reward By such an operat on,
which is th  natural onp, trie exchanges are not dis-
turbed, but the broker are «no depend, not upon
arrangements to fanli'aie exchanges for their pro-
fits, but upon the derangement of them If banks
are di turbers of exchanges, and history and expe-
rience tell u^ thr\ are vho are they lhatwant
more b.anks'i If the banks pay sppcie for their
bi Is, and redeem them when demanded, exchanges
never cost any more than the expense of transport-
ing ihe specie from the debtor's residenc to that of
the ere liter Look into iny ef the States of the
Union, and wherever banks are in good cred t this
will be found to be true, but if the banks where the
ba anses are are m bad credit, in* exchanges will
-ise a^ tne credi' of the bank paper fall , though
not alwajs m th  same rano, «ind if 'he b?!ane s
a e s°ttl d by th  aid of the broker, be ge s the be-
i efit of the advances which grow out of t1 c ele
i?ngement of the paper eurrencj If I am correct
in regard to exchanges, I thmk a National B=mk
is not wanted to aid the exchanges, unl°s« sue i a
Bank differs in its nature and character from Stve
bark, and, ro Kr as my knowledge ex  á , >
does not, except in this, that so fir as all banks,
under the same system, have attributes and p wer
for evil, tue greater the power, the greater maJ b 
the evil, resulting from th-ir operations Tne
basis of a paper currency is of a double naturp be
mg partly spscie and partly confidence, and when
either of these fan-., the paper begins to sink, and
when both fail, the paper is worthless The re-
presentative, therefore, fails to perform its office as
a circulating medium Whether the bank is of
national or State institution, it has the same infir-
mities, and is subject to the same expansions and
contractions If the Slate bank  could always
know when the national banks would exoand and
contract, and to what extent, they might possibly
derive some benefit from it, but this cannotbeknown.
If all banks could be managed prudently, and con-
ducted by discree1 men, their paper would be
m much better credit, and the public, as well as
individuals, would be in much less danger of suf-
fering losses by them The same danger of in-
discreet and bad management besets both the na-
tional and State institutions The only corrective
of abuses, m the management of banks, will be
found, I apprehend, in an exposure to public view
of ?U the business and transactions of the banks;
and this the public can never have the benefit of,
for they are creatures of darkness, and when the
light ot day is made to shine upon their banking
operations, they will not answer the purposes for
which thev are designed, and will be abandoned
The la'e United States Bank of Pennsylvania, the
Eagle Banlr. of New Haven, and many others I
cou'd mention, are illustrations of this principle
I believe all the banks in the State of Connecticut,
at this time, have sound capitals and are discreet-
ly managed'; at any rate, they are so far as I have
any knowledge of them I must, therefore, con-
clude, that the brokers are more in want of a Na-
tional Bank than ihe other class of people, whose
business requires an occa ional loan from the
banks The evidence furnished us by the board
or trade in the city of New York, of the utility or
mutil.ty of a National Bank in conducting the
mercantile interest, is not to be disregarded How
is that board divided m opinion as to ihe benefits
of a Bank to that great and important class of
' people? We find one of tne most extensive bro-
kers m the Union, supported by a portion of the
board, whose interests are akin to his, ln favor of a
Bank, urging its es abiishment with all the ear-
nestness that a great and prospective interest would
indicate The presence of the English bankers,
with whom this broker, and through him, all the
family of brokers m this country are known to
have a close and mtimat^ connection, exerting their
influence in favor ot the Bank, is replete with cau-
tion to all whose m cr°sts are adverse to the bro-
kers, against the establishment of a Bank We
find in the decision ol thi> board an at'monition
upon this subject not to rema n unheeded Near-
ly all ihe regular lmpotlins merchants, who are
members of this board, and who do th"ir business
upon a sound capilai, I beheve are opposed to a Na-
tional Bank Their interests do not harmonize with
the brokers,  hose interest it is to derange their bus -
ness hat they may profit by it in time of distress.
If the brokers' and mone\ dealers' nterests are
hostile to the mdus'nal interests of our country,
compn«ing almost all the other interests in. tte
co nmumty, and tueys'e favorable to a Bark, and
whose eagle eyes seldom overlo k or mistake their
interest, sh.uld na the latter pause before they
thTOw themselves |mto the jaws of their de-
voured
i have now, Mr Presiden', given all the answer
I desired to, 11 the i-equest of the  Legislature of
my State, that I should vote for,   and support  the
bill for a National Bank    Th° remaining part of
my remarks upon the bill will be designed to show
I    tnat C ngreoshas no po*er to grant a Bank  char-
j   tfr, ^nd th~t should one be grented, it may be re-
pealed, and, m my belief, will bo rcp aled  by the
direction of the fop e     Witn.  the Democracy it
|    will be m?de i rallying point, and they will  never
!    leave it until   t is repeaed     A standard of value
I    and currency for th   use of a na ton, is an attri-
bute or sr vere gn y, and no one of ihe great  and
t   subs antive powers of Government is   more ím-
I    portant to th° people than thnt  which enters the
power of making and estab i hir g a currency and
standard of value    By it the value of all the pro-
perty of this great nation, that is deposed of, is to be
measured, and although money is not necessary to
exchange it all, } et that is the < tandard and measure
of all value.   Some thousand millions m value oí
