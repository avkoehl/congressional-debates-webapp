Lieutenant-Colonel CLENDENIN,

Commanding at Muddy Branch:

COLONEL: It is reported from Darnestown that firing has been heard in the direction of the river. What is it? The canal-boat C. Clifton is held in custody by your command near Edwards Ferry. Turn over the boat and cargo to agents who will be sent by the canal company. If the crew have violated orders hold them until charges are preferred, and forward them together to these headquarters. Answer.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MUDDY BRANCH, November 15, 1864.

(Received 2.30 p. m.)

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff:

The information from the picket-line received within an hour reports all quiet. I will send messengers to ascertain if anything is wrong, and inform you if there is. I released the canal-boat Clifton two days ago. The party was arrested for supposed murder of a soldier, but the surgeon pronounces it a case of death from the effects of liquor.

Very respectfully,

D. R. CLENDENIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
