removing the track from Piedmont to Manassas Junction; the same cars being used in distributing the iron on Winchester road as were in loading it not forty-eight hours previous on Manassas Gap road. It is a fact worthy of note that during a business extending but little over seven months, in which time 2,238 trains passed over the road, carrying nearly 200,000 persons, but one accident of any consequence occurred and but one man was killed. The advantages resulting from the completion of this line were observable, not only in furnishing supplies to the Army of the Shenandoah, but in rapidity with which troops could be moved. At the time of moving the Sixth Army Corps, the First Division arrived at City Point by way of Washington in forty-four hours after leaving Stephenson's, and the Second Division in fifty-two hours, saving at least thirty hours by having this short line in fifty-two hours, saving at least thirty hours by having this short line open. Please see tabular statements for ruther information. This sums up the report of my operations in the Department of Virginia during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865.

I desire to express my thanks to superintendents, engineers, agents, and other employes on the different lines for the manner in which they have discharged their varied and arduous duties. Always diligent and faithful, they have never been found wanting when called on. It is with pleasure I acknowledge the services of Mr. J. M. Pitkin, principal assistant, in charge of all business appertaining to my duties; his untiring energy and faithful services cannot be too highly appreciated.

Respectfully submitted.

J. U. MOORE,

Chief Engr.and General Supt. Military Railroads of Virginia.
