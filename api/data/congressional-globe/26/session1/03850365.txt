his decided Asapprobatten upon the very extraordinary at-
count to whk h the gentleman from North Caroll. a had called
tlie atiention of the committee I regret, Mr, said Mr B that
eueh an account had ever been incurred or presented «rams
the Government, and more especially he regretted that the Co-
vemment had piud it. So far as the amount ol money   as con-
cerned, it was a small matter; but the principle involved was
toe same, whether the expenditure was one lollaror one mil
lion of dollar? II  was the blind advocate ol no man or any
set of men on earth, he acknowledged his adhesion to no party
save that of the glorious and gallant State Rights men of the
South, jwexretfiBce, ihe Nulliñers, for whom he claimed, in
the face of the world, the high and honorable distinction ot a
pure, disinterested,and noble devotion to principle, indepen
<*• / of men, tberefoie, come from what quarter it may, he
waa ready and willing to go with the gentleman fiom North
Carolina, or with any other man on that Boor, in condemning
and exposing any and every mataBCe ol political degeneracy
Mr B. said he wished to deal with tacts Let the Op
position «ase 10 indulge, as they had too oltendone, in vague
and general denunciation of fraud and corruption It waa pure
declamation, let them come up to the mark with farts and spe
rifications, this was what he had called on them to do all
along; and whenever they did it, as in this instance, and pro
dueeil conclusive proof of their chaiges of fraud, he he'd him
self obligated todo every thing in his poner to forward .in in
reatigauon, and, when error was detected, to expose and con
demn it.
He recognised no power in any Department of the Federal
Government to contract Mich an account, nor had this House
any constitutional authority to appropriate money to fay it
The supei intendent of the branch mint at Charlotte, had clearly
rxceeded his official duties In  purchasing  these  plants and
Sowers.   The Government had departed from the strict 1 neol
lis duty  passing the account, ami we «hall be rlear'y in vtn
lation of our duty if we appropna'e money to pav for this
North Carolina flower garden      But why is it that this fraud
has not been previously investigated? Why was it permitted to
slumber from l~3s, the date of the account, until this particular
peind of time, when the claims of Georgia were legitimately
before the House 1   Yesterday, the appropriation for the branch
mint ta North Carolina was under discussion, ard was retained
in the bill; during all that discussion, we heard nothing ol these
bulbous roots and tender exotics    Why were they not I At n in
traduced to the notice of the committee, instead of being thrust
forward at this time, when the constqnence may be loemhar
rass the claims of the branch mint at Ddhlonega to the favora
ble consideration of this House?   Although he was willm?, at
all times, to investigate any matter where there Tras even the
least appearance ol fraud, ye  lie besought the House not to
entertain a prejudice against the mint establishment in Georgia
on account of anv supposed corruptions which may exist at
Ihe branch in North Carolina    He ventured to say that nosuch
account would be presented from Dahlonetra—the soil of h.s
own State, emphatically the land of noble trees and beautiful
flowers, could furnish, if it were competent for this Govern
raent to engage in such improvements, as rare  an 1 exquisite
specimens of vegetable production as any o.her quarter of the
globe, but even if it couid not, he was not prepared to rote rro
ney out of the Treasury for the consummation of so questiona
ble an object
Having said thus much, said Mr B id order to avert any
prejudice which may have been engendered against the mint
at Dahlonega, by unnecessarily bringing into th s discussnn
the supposed frauds at Charlotte, he would now proceed to
■peak to the merits of the question now before the House
His friend from Maryland [Mr Johnson] had moved to
strike out this section of the bi'l, which provdes the appro-
priation of--------thousand dollars for defraying the expenses
oi the branch mint at Dahlonega. in Georgia. This motion
was based solely on the ground of economy, fur he wou'd not
believe that the honorable gentleman from Maryland enter
ttined anjrfeelmg of hostility toward  the institution i self, or
desired to withdraw the ordinary appropriations for carrying
it on, except on the ground of expediency, and a saving to
the Government How, then, stands the question of economy
in this easel This Government must com money—there is a
constitutional requisition on the subject—and, in accordance
with that reqnisi ion, national mints, for the manufacture of
coin, must necessarily be established, otherwise Congress could
not, as required by the Constitution, "com money " These
establishments had been placed at Philadelphia, New Orleans,
Dahlonega in Georgia, and at Charlotte in Mecklenburg coun
ty. North Carolina. If the question as to their location, was
to come up de novo, where, think yoo, a disinterested man,
who had no object to accomplish but the good of the people,
would locale them 1 Why precisely m the heart of the gold or
silver region, H such a region existed in the country at all,
and if not, then nearest that port into which the greatest quan-
tity of bullion, or of the precious metals in their crude state,
were imported from foreign countries In makini such a loca
uon, all the risk and expense of transportation would be saved,
and the original producer would not be saddled with the losses
which must ensue from the multiplication of agents necessary
to the successful operation of a mint situated at a great dis-
tance from the point of production In «uch a case the natural
order would be preserved, and instead ofconstan ly transporting
the material, at great expense, to the place of manufacture,
yoo would make but one transportation of the machinery to
the spot, where every thing would be found ready to your hand
If economy, then, was the object, why does not the renlleman
propose to abolish the mint at Philadelphia! Does the soil of
that city, or of Pennsylvania, or of any of the neighboring
States, produce gold and silver in any quantity, or of any qua
lny1 Ar  there any turface or vein mine  in the streets of
the erty of brotherly lovel Do they abound, as does the whole
region about Dahlonega, with the yellow ore of the South?
No, sir, the veriest alchymist could turn nothing there into
gol I. «ol even if he had access to the vaults of the United States
Bank—unless, indeed, the rotable fiction of the transmutation of
metals should turn out at last to he a solemn truth If, then,
sir, fie city of Philadelphia be barren of gold, the next question
is, can the port of that uty compete with that of New York-or
Boston in the importation of the precious metals from abroad!
I have no statistical data now before me, upon which I might
base an estimate, but the received opinion Is, that where Phila-
delphia imports one dollar of foreign gold, either of the other
cities imports a hundred And yet, sir, the gentleman from
Philadelphia [Mr Ogle] yesterday proposed to put a barrel of
powder under the mint of Dahlonega, in the very heart of the
jeld region, and blpw it up, upon th« «core, a  he said, oftcv-
II
nomjr Why, sir, 1 doubt not the time will come, when labor
and improved machiaery shall hive been successfully applied
to ihe development ot the ill mitable resources of Ihe Cherokee,
country in Georgia—when, inste id of applying the torch to the
branch mint at Dahlonega, the mother mint itself Jn Philadel
phia will be blown sky high                                 *'
But it is and that the mint in Georgia lean erpen?e the Go
vemment if this be an objection to the m nl/in Georgia, it is
equally true with respect to that in Philadarfihia Where, let
me ask, was there ever a  establishment fjfr ihe coinage of mo
ney that was not an expense, either to i\/k Government or the
individual wli > owned it
A mint docs not increasekhe quantiu/of gold, on the contrary,
it mu't, of course, decreaseit 1 he Josses necessarily inciden
tal to the process ol coinage must, uf the natu e of things, de
crease the quantity of metal originally supplied to the establish
menu and therefore all this talk apout loss and expense, is just
as applicable, nay, much moresfftoihe Philadelphia mint, as to
the establishment in Georgia     /
Sir, said Mr B there lsanourcr, and not leas interesting view
of this case Asa Kepresenujfive from the Slate of Georgia, as
a S)uthern man, deeply mterfsted in the prosperity, not only of
mv own State, abovt all ottjlrs, but of the whole South, I can
not but feel lealous of every movement here, the tendency of
which will lie to strike at our favorite theory of free trade, an I
by implication at our proposed system ol direct importations If
the punen lea of free ttade were brought to bear upon this
subiect, every thing would be left to its obvious position and
natural course But if the motion on your table prevails
that position and that course will be violently .nterru ted, and
instead of placing your mint in the midst of ) our gold, you re
move it to a distance, and locate it in a remote ración, when all
the difficulties of transportation must be encountered before vnu
ran begin to crmpete with the more natural location Sir,
free trade is natural trade, and the natural position of an es
tablishment which is to supply the medium of that trade, is
precisely at that place where the commodity, to be usetl in
manufacturing th.it medium, can be procured at the least pos
aible expense
Sir, said Mr B the South makes cotton, and the South
makes sold—both of these articles are cash in the market of
the world The North produces neither of them, and yet she
has managed, through our facile acquiescence in her monopoly
of trade, to fertilize her barten and trozen hill , and enrich her
energetic and enterprising population And this she has x.
compl shed by apptopr atmg to her own benefit the lntermedi
ate use of these peculiar productions of our soil and labor
Heretofoie we have submitted to an unnecessary Northern
agency in *he disposition of our cotton and if we fol'ow in the
same track, we will send our gold to Philadelphia to be s ruck
into com Southern en'erpru>e and ingenuity are not compe
tent to conduct successfully a mint at Dahloneea, where the
gold grows, hut the precious metal, alter it has been ga
thered by Southern labor, must be sent to a Northern city for
eamage
But, sir, said Mr B suppose ihe gent'eman could succeed in
his effort to abolish this branch mint at Dahlonega, what, let
me ask him, would he have accomplished? Why he would
take from the enterprising, industrious, and patriotic people of
that section of Georgia, perhaps the most interesting part of
the State, an ins ltutton which had greatly contributed to then
prosperity In that region there are numerous gold diggers and
miners, whose labor supplies the mint If that establishment
be abolished they will bo obliged either to export to foreign
countries, or fell it at a loss from 8 to 10 per cent in us crude
state, to Northern speculators, or bank agents Yes, sir abo
hsh the mint in that region, and you throw open the donrto
numerous extortioners and speculators, men who live not by
the sweat ot their brows, but who make their daily bread by
their wits, ends, and afjpropmle to themselves by then tricke
ry and cunning the hard earnings of other men s labor 1 bus
the people, who now have acoess to a mint where¿heir week's
labor may be converted into com of a known and ascertained
value, will be subjected to the tene'er merries of men who will
get from them, on the best terms th'y can, the precious metal
la Us crude state, and the loss of at least ttn per cent will fall
upon the less intelligent but more honest laborer
I am sure, sir, my friend from Maryland has not fully con-
a-dered the consequences of his motion, if he had he would
not have mads it, for I am willing ti believe that no man
man breathe?, more devoted than he is to Southern interest and
institutions
Mr CONNOR replied to the remarks of Mr Stanly, and
spoke against the abolishment of the branch mint
Mr DAWSON opposed the amendment with much earnest-
ness lie areiiedasa reason why the product of the mines in
Georgia, and ihe amount of coinage which, to a certain extent,
depended on the mining operations were not eo great as n ere
annctpated that labor was much higher in Georgia thai any
year previous For the reason that the labor was more produc
live that year than at any previous j ears, the whole labor was
convened from the mines to the growing of cotton But this
year labor being much cheaper and much depressed, it would
drive the whole mass of labor to the mines, and the conce
qnence he said, would be, that the coinage at that establishment
thisjear would lie much greater than in the past year Mr
D then showed tie comparative operations of the parent mint
at Pndadelpria for the first five years of its exstence, and the
branch mint at Dahlonega, Ga forthefirst two years The pa
rent mint had, in the five yeirs abov  mentioned, coined only
an aggregate of *71 000, whilst the branch mint, situated in a
forest, had, in the first year of its existerce, coined forty
per cent more than the first five years of the parent mint,' and
in the second year (1839) had co Bed «123,870, and if it had sil
ver, it would have coined four times that amount He con-
tended that the only counteracting power to prevent the coin
from going to the commercial citiesin the East and North, was
to pertinaciously hold on to the mints
One of the greatest reasons that this mint should be ennti
nued, was that it was situ ited in the heart of one of the richest
mineral regions Every varn ty of ore is to be found there in
the greatest abundance, and in the course of a few years, in con-
sequence of the new impure given to enterprise by the
erection of this mil t, this country would become one of the rich-
es portions of the world Capital wns fl iwlng in from every
section of the world, and scientific men were attracted there
in great numbers 'I hus would a development of the rich re
sources of the earth be produced, and would result not to the
interest of Georgia alone, but to the wealth and greatness and in-
terest of the whole nation It was the usefulness of this mint he
advocated, and did not go far it because it happened to be lo-
cated in Georgia Ho was not governed by sectional feelings,
but by great natío nal feelings He testified to the economical
administration of the mint at Dahlonega, and certified to the
good character of the superintendent—he was an honest man.
The amount of expenditures in that mint was small in compari-
son to other mints
Mr CONNOR hero read a statement showing the expendí
tures at Charlotte and Dahlonega for three yeais, which proved
them to be nearly equal
Mr HUBBAKD rose to congratulate 'he country that the ex-
travagance in our public officers was about to be lopped off
by consent of both parties There was no method but to re-
duce them to proper allowance—compel them to live carefully
and economically But, sir, whilst we are at this work, I request
gentlemen of the opposite party not to look so Bharp for the
«jole in the eye of the Democrats, but look more to remove the
beam from their own Let them cut off these extravagant ap-
propriations of millions, for purposes that enrich one secuon
ef the Union, whilst they impoverish the other I speak of
gentlemen os a party—the gentleman from Georgia personally
opposes all of them as to this item of floweis, if the gentleman
would go to the mother mint of Phi adt Iphia, he wou'd perhaps
find it i heie to a greater extent, and pei haps he wou Id nnd that
it commenced before the election of Geneial Jackson, and long
before Mr Van Buren waselected
Mr SI1EPARD would not trouble the committee with an elec-
tioneering speech, but he would make a few suggestions to
those who were so hostile to the branch mints fcince his at-
tention had been called to this matter, yesterday afternoon,
he had found, by a document on his table, ihe amount of gold
ani silver imported to this country at different penods of time
Durmethe hist year, 1S39 the amount of bullion imported *t
the city of Philadelphia was Sr)0000 He had not been able
to sum up the amounts imported into New York, Boston, and
other Northern cities, but, on casting his eye ever the tabu-
lor statement before him, it appeared that ihe greatest
amount imported into this country had come to the city of New
Orleans Now, when gentlemen contended that we had more
mints than were necessary, the real question would he, which
of them ought to be abolished—those in the South, in the very
heart of the gold country, and where the foreign bullion was
imported, or the one at Philadelphia, where not a single grain
of the precious metals was produced, and where but little was
received from foreign countries? At therommencementof the
Government, Philadelphia was the great emporium of com
merer, here was established the Mint and the National Bank,
a revolution had since taken place in the business of the csun-
tiy, and yet, by means of these naitonal institutions, Philadel
phia has ctptmuedto bethe depot of coin, and to control the
commercnl afliirsof the Union Sir, it is time to destroy these
secttono.1 priviltgee, it is time to place every cuy and every
State on an equal footing and submit to the operation of these
natural causes, which, ifleftalone, would produce the greatest
amo int of national wealth If the question were new, the de-
cision might be doubtful, but as the expenditure has been made,
the house erected, and the machinery at work, why throw
away this labor acd expense1 Why destroy establishments
situated in the regu n where trade and rature have accu-
mulated the precious metals, in order to favor a city, whither
only attificial regulation would direct them
Give these branch mints a fair trial The member from
Pennsylvania, had stated that the coin struck at the three South-
ern m nts had cost one fourth, or a third, of the amount coined
This may be tru«, and this was probably the case with the
mammoth at Philadelphia during the fir«tyear of its establish-
ment But this is not an argumert The honorable member is
a lawyer, and probably Ins library, his horse and carnage, and
other necessary outfits for a travelling attorney, were five times
more than the amount of his briefs during the early years of
prart ce; and would the member therefore say that the setting
up hw was a bad business! Would he not rather wait, and
give his industry and abilities a fair and longer trial? During
the la«t year 4600,000 weie coined at the three bran h mints
The amount is gradually ard surely increasing, and if gentle-
men wtll be patient, and if Philadelphia receive from this Go-
vernment no aitificial advantages, by havin" the control of the
paper system, or some other trick of the Federal head, I feel
assured that in a few years the greatest amount of coin wi I
proceed from the Southern mints Sir my constituents aie not
immediately ¡nterea'ed in this appropriation, they are very far
from Charlotte; they will never have the least benefit from this
expenditure, but as a North Carolinian I am opposed to the
destruction of the mint until ample experience proves it to be
expensive and useless I would despise to advocate a propo-
sion because a little advantage might accrue to the South; but,
sir, when North Carolina and Georgia have the precious me-
tals in the bosom of their soil, when trade brings to New Orleans
a vsst amount of foreign coin and bullion, why should our
mints be destroyed, and the one at Philadelphia be sustained
But a charge had been made against the superintendent of
the mint in North Carolina, and it seemed that he had expended
Ihe sum of 8218 in ornamenting the building with trees, &c.
Now he wou'd not say that he was in favor of such expendi-
tures, but did we not act upon the same principle ourselves!
Would not the same obiecnun apply to the expenditure for
trees, flowers, &c for ornamenting the public walks and gar-
dens of this Capiti 1 Thffe trees did not belorg to private in-
divihiale they were the property of the public and the poor-
est man in the community rouldcnjny the walks, and inhale
the fragrance of the flowers, as well as he who expended a
small ponton of the public money on such improvements.
A" e\[ en litures of this nature were for objects belonging to the
people, and not for individuals it p'ared ihe matter in an en-
tnoly new lteht But jet he would admltthat he could not em
courige such expenditures, and if gent'emen thought that the
superintendent of this mint had art  d wrong, the Secretary of
the Treasury rr-ieht dock it from his salary.
The gentleman from Georgia said, that the new po'ic^ otthe
