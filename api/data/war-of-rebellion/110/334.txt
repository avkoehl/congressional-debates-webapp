(Received 4th.)

President DAVIS:

Breckinridge has all the men I can spare. He has been reduced since he left one- half by sickness. Must not fail. I want Baton Rouge and Port Hudson, giving me the mouth of Red River. Batteries should be put up at Port Hudson. Can your order me some men to guard and hold! Force of the enemy below small and not formidable. With small army can take New Orleans. My district is drained; but few men left; many plantations without white males; want to do, but have not the means. I appeal to you. Louisiana troops best acclimated. Giver me an order for Waul's Texas Legion by telegraph.*
