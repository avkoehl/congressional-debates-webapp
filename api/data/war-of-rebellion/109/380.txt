Major-General HARTSUFF,

Commanding Corps at Glasgow, or wherever else he may be found:

GENERAL: You must take care of Carthage, and should send a man there to command, as Stokes is not the man. You want a fighting man there. Please send me the rest of the pack-mules when you are ready to spare them. We have got this far all right; have possession of Shelbyville, and Bragg reported in force at Tullahoma.
