Lieutenant Colonel MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistnat Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the movements of my division on the 18th instant: Breaking camp at 5 a. m., I moved on the old stage road, via Stafford Court-House, to Aguia Creek; thence upon a neighborhood and military road to the right, crossing the Chopawamsic and Quantico Creeks, and passing near Dumfries, established my command in night bivouac on Powell's Run at 6. 30 p. m., having marched twenty-one miles. Upon the arrival of my column at Aquia Creek the troops of the Second Division and the trains of the First and Second Divisions were still in camp on its opposite bank, and it was to avoid the delay that I moved my infantry on the road above mentioned, although it made a longer march.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
