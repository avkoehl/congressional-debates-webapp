THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

was an appropriation of $250,000 for this item.
Now, when you look at the condition of the
Treasuiy, and when you look at the fact that we
are compelled to borrow, in order to got along
with those things that are indispensable for car"
vying on tiie Government, it does seein to me
that wo might well reduce the appropnation of
$050,000 to the amount tlint my amendment pro-
poses. We can do that, I think, without doing
very serious damage to the coast survey. Sup- t
pose tins work is compelled to stop for a year, or j
during this commercial crisis, or mm! the trade !
of the country should lilt the coilers t f the coun- !
try, as they were filled before this revulsion came ;
on, what would be the dilapidation ^ It is said j
these works do not change, that they do not have !
to be resurveyed. If n^t, I can sec no damage j
to be produced except such -is mav ltow out of ;
the dilapidation of the vessels used in the work, i
The materials arc not dilapidated, and will not 1
grow worso. The bill proposes ^ 10,000 for the 1
repair of the- vessels. The £30,000, I take i:, '
ought to preserve them. It sterns to mo the worst '
dilapidation wouid be the dfi \pida;ion of (he sel- ;
aiies of those employed, and [ submit that this !
is an item in which ietrenchmeni m that respect i
nuffht well bo npphed. ;
Mr. M ALLORY. I will answer some of these !
objections, and the last one first. The honorable j
Senator from Alissoitii, I ptesnmr, has not^iven j
that attention to the c>ast survey tli.it he has to |
the general business of the ^'ini'e. lie a-'hs why !
we cannot reduce now, and speaks of diiapiaa- j
tion, and says the deputation would he in the |
salaries of those who are employed. V/r!I, sir,
perhaps the Senator from al.ssoun never thought
of the fact, that to constitute a corps of men fvr ,
the coast survey, you have got to select one nun ■
in a handled thousand—'Ost about. In the fust
piece, H takes an educateM! pi^uh ir f;>r the sm-
vice,and m*eat practical expem nee. The ob]< c-
tion I ha\e to his aiiru-rn nt is, that if you
constrain the chnf of the Coast Survey, w5 o has
now mad'1 his arran^t-mmits commen^uiate with
the sum estimated to have them in the field, to
discard these employes, lie will not gather them
together again m time to commence the work
without a very great expenditure, such as would
be a very bad economy here.
It has been intimated, Mr. President, that this
measure is opposed by gentlemen ~\\ ho concede us
propriety, its constitutionality, and nationality,
because others will not go into their .schema s, and
appropiute money for the 11\ei s and h ubors of
the V/i-st. i should regitt if that is so: I should
exceedinedv iegret that the Senate of the Unite;]
Stat"s should, at any time, come to such a con-
clusion as this. It would argue a wry gient do- i
ccy of public vntue, Why, sir, the State of ;
Illinois is immediately interested with the coast ;
survey. Every bag of vvheat she produces is en- !
hanced or lessened m value by aH the expenses i
which grow lmmediaf ly or aie decreased by the ■
coast survey. They are enhanced by all the ex-
penditures of shipment, by pdotage, by insurant1, I
and by many other expenditures which the coast j
survey is intended immediately to decteas?. j
We have a duty to peiform with refaence to ,
harbor defenses, with n*ferencc to naval and mil- ;
itary defenses, and to establish which we must ,
hnve the coast survey. Now, let me state here, ,
that the Ihitish, who, as has iv-en well remarked ,
by the Senator from New Yoik, survey their1
own livers and harbois and all others, wore en-
caged here under the guns of Lull Delawaie in
making a purvey of our own harbois as late as
1840 and 1813. in h'4G, tiny were ee a?cd in ,
making a survey of Oat island upon our own
coast. ° They suivcy all the world, and in many
,ia?u of our soath"in const now Ch<h*s chart for
a portion of the West Indies and Fhmda is the
^andmd chart by v/hAh vessels navigate the
ocean. We owe something to foreign nations
with reference to the coast smvey as a 'nydi'ml
community. We owe A to cr/ih^ed conimimitieo
Lo furmJi them with charts. Our self-respect will ;
not peimit us to remain idle, and let the dangers 1
of our coact be unknown to navigators who ap- i
proach them. !
If there were no other work during the last^
yeai to demonstrate the ethci-mcy and the vaiue Oj ,
tins corps, i could point to the harbor of Cliarles- ^
ion alone. It has been aliud- d to by the honor- _
able ftenotor from South Carolina. The channel .
which has been there lately discovered was known
to have existed a hundred years ago. It has only
lately been rediscovered. Almost every month
has deepened thatchannel; and itbidsfairspced-
ily to become the principal channel for commer-
cial purposes to Chaileston. Within the last two
months, a Iaige channel, of twenty-two or twenty-
four feet of water, has been discovered, by the
coast survey, leading into the sound of St. George,
and making the bar of A ppalachicola—near winch
no large ships have hitherto approached—one
of the deepest harbors south of the Chesapeake.
Now, if nothing else than this had been discov-
ered by the coast survey this year, it would dem-
onstrate its value. We can not decrease the amount
of money estimated for the ieason I a^sirrned with-
out entailing a larger expendituie, IVlr.uy of the
men employed oi; the coast sm vey wouid be cc^t
! adrift, they would go abroad, and we could not
| reclaim them again.
| Mr. POLLv. 1 will state that T have the act of
j the last session befoie me, and I liud that m this
! fust item of the present bill thorns no ) eduction;
, there is no reduction in the sui'\ey of the Pacific
| coast; there is no reduction in the appropriation
i for the Florida keys, 'I he first reduction we
j come to is m the clause, '* for luniung a line to
I connect the tnan^ulation of the Atlantic coast with
j that of the Culf of Mexico, across the Fionda
j peninsula, $15,000." Tnere is a reduction there
! of $5,000. Then, there was hist year appro.a; -
} at-'d for " publishing the obs.a vations made m the
progress of the survey of tiie coast of the United
1 States, ^15,000.That is sti icken out. Theap-
j propriauon for the repairs ot ves^'U coimeetid
i wHh the survey is ^,5.1)00 less than it v. as ! K
yen. That is all the reduction tin-re is m tins
; bill. Willi those exception-', the same amount is
: appropriated. Vy'hen tlie 'Ih easui y was j^itthoi
aod o'.a'itloWi'ijj:, it mi^hthave In en very well to
!, i.avc approjtriated tSios^ amounts-, hut now, when
! the Trtasuiy is so lean 'hat we have to replenish
j; it by loans of $90,000,000 and ^15.000,000, there
|j is no reduction to be made ni tins matter. It seems
; to me very certain tint it is a work to winch the
j knde nnj;iit very well be applied.

! That was the act passed in 1851. These pay- I
ments were not made, and in 1855 the clause di-
recting them to be paid waspassed. They have not
been paid yet, however, and on inquiry of the
Secretary of the Interior, I learn that there is no
money on hand. This is gimply an appropriation
to enable him to make the payments referred to
in the act of 1855.
Mr. HUNTER. Do I understand the Sena-
tor from North Carolina to say that the debt was
assumed by law, but no appropriation made to
carry it out ? Is that the in ason ?
Air, CLINGMAN. There was in the Indian
bill of 1854, an appropriation of the fund in these
terms:
" The sum heretofore appropriate foi tbot-e pui pose,
and earned ro die >inpiu- I'liaPu- hee-bj u',i|.p:epnated."
That is the act of ld5-i. Then this is the act

That is the appropriation directing him to pay
it, or rather that is the law; but tiiere was no ap-
pa opi iation contained in it, and I learn that there is
no money on hand by winch he can comply with
that act.
?Jr. 11UNTKR., I should like to hear the

now who receive ^400 a yeoi as disbursing agents.
