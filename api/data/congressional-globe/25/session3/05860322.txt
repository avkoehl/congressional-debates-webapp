APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 24,
25th Coito....3d Sess.
Indian Affairs—Mr. Everett.
Ho. of Reps.
appears to have been satisfactory to the Semi-
nole and emigrant Creek delegates then present,
and only wanted the assent of the eastern Creeks
to have rendered it a perfect fulfillment of the con-
dition. But to them it was notcommunicated, nor
was their assent asked They, however, "dis-
covered " the arrangement, and refused to sanc-
tion it. They sent word to the Seminole bands
"that while they were willing to receive them
withm their limits as a portion of the nation, they
■would not suffer them to enjoy any separate al-
lotment of their soil." And, sir, this fact came
to the knowledge of the Executive before the
ratification of the Seminole treaty. It came to
the knowledge of General Eaton while negoti-
ating with the Indians at Washington in the
•winter of 1834 And yet, notwithstanding this,
the Executive procured the treaty to be ratified
in the April following. The Seminóles refused
to execute the treaty, on the express ground that
the conditton had not been fulfilled, that no sep-
arate location had been provided for them 1
have the authority of General Eaton for saying
that this " was the essential cause of then reluct-
once to go off " This, his opinion, he commit
mcated to the Executive as early os March, ]835
This, sir, is the tieaty that we have been endeav-
oring for the last three yeais to execute by the
Seminole war.
The importance of the fulfillment of the condi-
tion to the Seminóles and to ouiselves is illus-
trated by the late special message of the Prtsi-
dent, (Doc No 93 ; From this it app< ars that
the fortune of war has placed in our hands two
thousand Seminóles, whom we have transported
over the Mississippi The Eastern Creeks have
also been removed to the lands assigned them,
and have taken possession of the lands allotted
to the Seminóles, and they now say, as they said
in 1833, " that they will not suffer the Seminóles
to enjoy any separate allotment of their soil "
And the Seminóles now, as in 1832, refuse to
amalgamate with the Creeks. These two thou-
sand Seminóles aie now encamped in the Chero-
kee country, near Fort Gibson, wheie they must
remain until a new location is provided for them
And now, at this late day, the President asks
Congress for the authority to provide them a lo-
cation elsewhere than that in the Creek country
How imlorttinnte that this had not been provided
for before the ratification of the treaty—before
the rominencemi nt of the Seminóle war '
The charge, then, is, that the Executive, know-
ing that the condition of the treaty had not been
fulfilled—knowing that nine tenths of the Creeks
had objected to allowing a separate location to
the Seminóles, and that they had given the Sem
moles notice of the fact—yet, knowing all this,
it proceeded to have the treaty ratified, and after-
wards, knowing that this objection continued
to be the essential reason why the Seminóles
would not remove, it proceeded to compel them
to remove by force 1 lay out of the question a
pretended subsequent agreement of a few of the
chiefs, as having been the result of an equally
unjustifiable force
This, str, is one of the specifications, and I
ask, was this " dealing justly and friendly
throughout'"
Another: In the course of the Seminole war, a
number of the Seminóles came in under the pro-
tection of a flag, and under express assurance of
its protection That flag was violated, they were
made prisoners—detained and transported beyond
the Mississippi Was this dealing just > On a
former occasion, 1 stated that I thought the House
would be satisfied with the course then (as was
intimated to me) pursuing by the Secretary of
War. I now state that 1 have no reason to be
satisfied. 1 know not what was done But no
public notice has since been taken of the trans-
action—no public censure—no atonement to the
Seminóles, or to ourselves. And what was the
consequence' Even Indians will not in future
respect your flag. You can hold no communica-
tion with the enemy. And you continue the war
And what do you propose' How is the war to
be conducted or ended > Is it seriously intended,
as has been proposed, to settle your lands in
Florida by tenants, by Knight service > Andaré
these feudal knights to be your defense against
the Seminóles    Or, perhaps, as is suggested by
a friend near me, are they to defend your army
against the Indians ? This knight service, too,
l  to be the defense along the whole line of your
western frontier But, sir, perhaps I am trench
mg on the powers of the Committee on Militaiy
Affairs, to which I believe one of the resolutions
commits this subject I will, however, take leave
to suggest a more simple and certain mode of
terminating the Seminole war. It is this, as your
flag may not be respected, dismiss one of the Sem-
inole prisoners, with a message that, if the Sem-
inóles will not cross a certain designated line, you
will not. Both sides are equally tired of the war,
and that line, I have no doubt, would be re-
spected On these terms you could have had a
peace a year ago
I pass from the Seminóles to the Creeks; and
I make this charge, that the Executive removed
the Creeks by a military force, in violation of an
existing treaty.
By the treaty of 24th March, 1832, certain res-
ervations were made to the Creeks, who, at the
end of five years, were entitled to patents in fee,
if they chose to remain, and in the meantime, the
United States agreed to remove all intruders The
twelfth article is in these woids
" Art xii The lTiuttd States are desirous tint lite
Orct ks should runove to the country weat of the Mn.h
sippi &.t Provulcl, hourier, Tint lili;* amele thill not
be construed so as to com pi 1 any Orí t k lmh in to emigrate,
but they shall be tree to go or stay, as they please "
The obligation to remove intruders was not
regarded The whites intruded upon them, and,
by fraud, by peisecution, by forgeiy, and by
force, evicted many of the Creeks from their lands
This produced resistance on the part of a few,
and this was magnified into a general hostility ot
the Creek nation The Executive, instead of re-
moving the intruders, removed twenty-two thou-
sand Clicks by a military force Then removal
was attended with unporalli led suiTeiing, result
ing, as I am iiifoimrjd, in the death of six thou-
sand within the first year Surh'wns the fate of
the Cneks, such the dealings which are pio-
nnnnted just and friendly thioughoiit
1 pass to the Cherok.es and is it title that you
have fulfilled your treaty stipulations with them'
I't rmu me to say that this is the fiist time that I
ever heard it assorted or pretended It n< i rhas
b( in contended on this floor that wi had fulfilled
them 1 now refer to the treaty of Holston, and
from that time to 1828 to the treaty of New
Echota I will refer you to the report of the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs of 1830, and ihe debates
of that session In neither was it contended or
pretended that we had fulfilled the stipulation with
the Cherokecs contained in the seventh article of
the treaty of Holston:
" Art vii The United Stites solemn!) gmnnty to the
Cherokee nation all tht ir lamia not hereby ct did "
The fact was notorious, conceded, that we had
not fulfilled this stipulation Instead of being de-
nied, our neglei t was attempted to be excused on
the ground that we had not the power, consist-
ently with the rights of the States I do not enter
upon the question of the validity of the excuse
it was debated at the last session my present
concern is with the allegation in the message, that
the United States have, in good faith, fulfilled all
its treaty stipulations with the Indian tribes, and
with admitted facts as to the treaty of Holston
The next charge has relation to the treaty of
New Echota It is, that this treaty was with less
than one hundred adult Cherokees, against the
known will of the great body of the nation, not
one in forty assenting to it At the last session
this treaty was fully debated I took part m the
debate, and shall not now enter upon the details
I take the leading fact, the uncontroverled and in-
controvertible fact, that this treaty was concluded
with less than one hundred Cherokees acting for
themselves alone, and I place it in opposition to
the declaration in the message that " no instance
of oppression and fraud" " can justly be charged |
upon this Government, since it became free to
pursue its own course." And that "its dealings
with the Indians have been just and friendly
throughout "                                                               i
I add one more charge to the list: it is, that
the treaty was a fraud upon the Senate as well ,
as on the Cherokees.    The specification is, that I
in the month of November, 1835, secret instruc- I
tions were given to conclude a treaty with a mi-
nority of the nation, which were not communi-
cated to the Senate when the treaty was befoie it
for ratification
The instructions communicated were those of
the 2d Apiil, which requned the assent of a ma-
jority of the nation; they were communicated ps
the i nsti uctions under which the treaty was made;
the direct evidence of the fact that secret mstiuc-
tions weie given which eventuated in the treaty,
came out long after us ratification, and by one of
those chances that happen in the oblique transac-
tions of men.   Strong presumptions aiose from
the letter of the Commissionei  of the 30th  of
October, taken in connection with the then exist-
ing state of things; but we are indebted* to a col-
lateral encumstance for the disclosure of the fact
that the secret instructions were given.   It was
this- the Auditor disallowed the charges foi the
special messenger who was sent for and returned
with the instructions; to obtain the allowances,
' the Commissioner disclosed the fact to the acting
Stcn tary of War, on which the account was al-
lowed and paid      What sort of dialing 13 this'
!     ¡mm h are some of the charg* s which have been
I hiictofoie nnde against the Government "since
j it became free lo pursue its own entuse "   The
I proofs nre in the rccoids of its Depnilmcnts
I have n \void to siy of the execution of the
treaty The time allowed the Cherokees for re-
moval expired on the 23d May, 18*18 In conse-
quence of an order pieviously issued, n. military
foice of seven thousand men was then rn the
Cherokee countiy, for the pmpo&e of íemoving
the Cheiokees As the crisis appioached, the
Administration became alaiined at the probable
consequences of a forcible removal of the Cheio-
i kee nation I am willing to believe that a senti-
ment of humanity mingled with the alarm On
the 22d of May the President submitted to Con-
gress a recommendation for a further appropria-
tion for the b< nefit of the Cherokees, and foi the
nl Iowa nee to them of the fuilher time of two yeai*?
for the completion of theirimigralion (Doc 376)
To pievcntall mistake on this subject, 1 reler to
the lettir of the Secictaiy to the Cherokee dele-
gation, of the 18th ot May, communicated in this
document
' As it has bei n before ob-erved, the Government of the
I nili il Mates c >uld not agree to this trtiele [viz ' Such
removal to lie commenced al the eirhest period, and to be
fully completed within two years from Una date'] without
tin consent ol the Stius whose rights arc involved, and
whose interests m ty he affected hv this stipulation Hut tho
Ex* cimve pledges itself to use its best efforts to induce them
to abstain (rom pressing tin ir claims in a manner that would
produce loss or inconvenience to the Cherokee people, anil
would be inconsistent with their being removed with every
reasonable comfort from the wi II known humanity and
generous charncter of the States ol Georgia, Tennessee, and
Alah una, there can be no doubt of Iheir granting every in-
dulgence which the interests ot humanity require , and if
two years are necessary lor ihe comfortable removal ol the
nation, ihe undersigned will venture to assure the delega
tion that their request will be granted "
In my opinion, the Executive had the light to
grant it without consulting any of the States. I
pass that My object is to show that the Exec-
utive submitted the proposition for the extension
of time to Congress, with an undertaking on his
part that it should be fulfilled. And how was it
defeated' The proposition was immediately com-
municated to the Executive of Georgia, with cor-
responding instructions to General Scott. A cor
respondence ensued between the Executive of
Geoigia and the Secretary of War, (Doe No
421,) by which it would seem " that his Excel-
lency must have misapprehended the true mean-
ing and intentof the Government " General Scott
had, on the 24th, commenced the work of arrest-
ing the Cherokees in view of their removal, and
he Was instructed " to continue the prosecution
of the measures he had adopted to remove the
Indians " A bill passed making a further appro-
priation for the Cherokees, General Scott contin-
ued the capture of the Cherokees, and all the grace
they obtained was a respite till October, then to
be removed under the conduct of their chiefs.
This, I admit, was a great favor, yet, with all the
care and prudence with which they have been re-
moved, the consequences have been most fatal.
The confinement of laige numbers together, the
change of diet, the agitation and fatigues of re-
moval, have resulted in the loss of about three
thousand     Much of this would have been pre-
