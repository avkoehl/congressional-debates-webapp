SAINT LOUIS, August 21, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

There are no siege guns here except two 20-pounder Parrotts, which have been issued to General Osterhaus for his division. They are about to start for Vicksburg. I think you had better stop them for Steele. The ordnance officer informs me that General Grant has some 20-pounder Parrotts, some 30-pounder parrotts, and some 24-pounder siege guns, all of which are in condition to be available. No doubt you can get from Vicksburg all Steele will want. I will push forward the forage matters as much as possible.
