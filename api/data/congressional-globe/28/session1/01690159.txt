SPEECH OF MR. THOMPSON,
OF MISSISSIPPI,
In the House of Representatives, February 9, 1844.—
On the right of the members elected by general
ticket to retain their seats.
Mr. THOMPSON addressed the House as fol-
lows:
Mr. Speaker: As my right to my seat on this
floor is involved in this discussion, and the decision
now to be made, the duty devolves upon me, in the
name of my constituents, to insist upon holding that
seat, and to vindicate, if possible to demonstrate,
the rightfulness of my title. I could not be induced
to retain my plaee, and exercise the high functions
daily discharged by me, one day longer, were I per-
suaded that those who sent me here had no right to
elect a member to Congress, or that a majority of
the people of Mississippi had not called upon me,
according to the laws of the land, to occupy the sta-
tion.
The constitution is explicit: "Each House shall
be the judge of the election, returns, and qualifica-
tions of its own members." There can be, then, no
doubt of our jurisdiction in this case. We cannot
escape from this duty if we would. We are the
judges, the sole judges, of the claims and rights of
the members of this House. And from tbat deci-
sion there lies no appeal; it is final and conclusive.
Being judges, you should throw off the garb of the
partisan? you should cease to desire, if any such
unhallowed purpose finds an abiding place in any
quarter of this House, to make political capital out
of a question which should be discussed without
passron, and decided with coolness and deliberation.
This is a great question, involving the dearest boon
of freemen, the brightest jewel of the sovereign—the
right to representation. The people have the heav-
iest stake, and the people's representatives should
not hastily, or with party bias, make a decision
which might interrupt, impair, or suspend their
most invaluable rights.
In this government, this right of representation—
this privilege of having a voice in making or alter-
ing those rules of action by which we are to be
guided—is our birthright, our dearly-bought but.
most inestimable inheritance. The full possession
and the frequent exercise of this right will ever tend
to elevate man in the scale of being. In its unques-
tioned and perfect enjoyment, he walks forth in all
the dignity of a freeman: deprive him of it, and you
make him a slave. Wherever this right exists,
there is liberty; and in proportion to the fulness and
extent of having this voice in the passage and ad-
ministration of laws, is political liberty to be meas-
ured.
Under different forms of government—in despot-
isms, monarchies, and aristocracies—a people may
enjoy their personal rights. The high administra-
tor of the government may possess a benignant
heart, and feel a strong and abiding sympathy for
his subjects. His regulations may be wise and for-
bearing: injustice may be prevented, vice suppress-
ed, and virtue promoted; and the people may be
contented, prosperous, and happy. The philoso-
pher, with a view to ridicule the popular clamor for
liberty, may exclaim with sarcasm:
"For forms of government let fools contest:
That which is best administered is best."
Yet the American freeman, when he examines this
favorable picture of the condition of the subject—
whose heart pulsates with pride at the trappings of
honor, and exults in the glories of his great ruler-'-
turns from the contemplation of such a man with
disgust, and says, in pity, He is a slave; and that
because he has 110 voice in making the laws which
govern his country.
For this right, our fathers laid down their lives;
and this is the life-current whose uninterrupted cir-
culation has kept up the vigor and strength and
beauty of our frame of government. This _ is the
great bulwark of fieedom—the palladium of liberty.
And surely we are not, in this government, to seek
for pretexts—to run after excuses—to give forced
and unnatural constructions to conflicting statutes—
to defeat, delay, or destroy, this right. Oil the con-
trary, we are bound, at all times, under every pre-
text, and amid all apparent conflicts of legislative
enactments, so to construe them as to leave tnis right
ill the hands of the people. Whatever Congress
and the State legislatures may do; whatever may be
the requirements on the one hand, and the resistance
ind obstinacy, if you please, on the other hand,—
the right is to stand. The people arc not, in the
eobwtS) distinctions of politicians and quibblers, to
be denied or cheated out of their right of represent-
ation.
What is the question now before the House? The
Stales of New Hampshire, Georgia, Missouri, and
Mississippi, in conformity to the requirements of
the constitution, had prescribed the times, places,
and manner of holding elections for representatives
to Congress. These regulations had been long and
repeatedly acknowledged to be constitutional; they
had been made to suit the views of convenience and
policy of the people of those States. No complaint
was heard from any quarter that, in their regula-
tions, these States had done any wrong, or had ex-
ercised any oppression on their own or any other
people. No murmur of discontent had reached these
halls. Yet, while these laws are in full force and
efficacy, the last Congress enacts, "That in every
case where a State is entitled to more than one rep-
resentative, the number to which each State shall be
entitled under this apportionment, shall be elected by
districts composed of contiguous territory, equal in
number to the number of representatives to which
said State may be entitled; no one district electing
more than one representative." The legislatures of
these four States, satisfied with the regulations they
had previously prescribed, have stood still, and
have not altered, or modified, or changed their elec-
tion laws. The people, not the legislatures of these
four States; the people who have to obey laws when
made by competent authorities; the people who
compose and surroort this government by their toil
and courage; the* sovereign people, to whom this
government belongs, have sent representatives here
to watch over their interests and maintain their
rights. We are here by acknowledged majorities;
and no man claims our seats. Now, the question to
be decided is, are the people of these four States to
be disfranchised on account of the neglect of their
legislatures to yield to the mandate of this govern-
ment? It matters not what the State legislatures
ought to have done; but what they have done. I
will not stop here to discuss the point whether the
State legislatures were bound to conform to and carry
out the laws of Congress or not. It is sufficient
to my purpose to state the fact. The legislatures  !«
