hand a specimen of the way it was done by
Government contract and the way it is now
done by the Government Printing Office, and
the difference in cost is $75,000 a year. The
whole stationery business of the Departments
is full of corruptions of this kind; and I wish
to say that it affords me very great gratifica-
tion to learn that our Secretary, who has the
purchase of some of the stationery for the Sen-
ate, is in favor of this bill.
Mr. MORTON. Mr. President, this is a
very important bill and makes very radical
changes in regard to the purchase of all the
stationery for the Government, giving it sub-
stantially to one man. It is a bill that will be
resisted and lead to very general debate, I am
satisfied, for which there is no time to-night.
A bill of this kind ought not to be pressed just
at the last hours of the session.
Mr. ANTHONY. I will correct my friend
from Indiana. It gives it to the joint Com-
mittee on Printing, composed of three Sen-
ators and three Representatives. Everything
is to be done under their direction. 1 will not
persist, however, in urging the bill now.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I call for the
consideration of the bill regularly before the
Senate.
ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL.

tives, by Mr. McPhersox, its Clerk, announced
that the House had disagreed to the amend-
ments of the Senate to the bill (H. R. No.
1803) making appropriations for the support
of the Army for the year ending June'30, 1870,
and for other purposes, asked a conference
on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses
thereon, and had appointed Mr. J. A. Gar-
field of Ohio, Mr. F. C. Beamax of Michigan,
and Mr. G. M. Dodge of Iowa, managers at
the same on its part.
The Senate proceeded to consider its amend-
ments to the bill (H. 11. No. 1803) making
appropriations for the support of the Army for
the year ending June 30, 1870, and for other
purposes, disagreed to by the House of Repre-
sentatives.
On motion by Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, it
was

ments disagreed to by the House, and agree to the j
contereneo asked by the House of Representatives

hundred and ceventy-eight inclusive, as fol-
lows :
To defray the expense of a preliminary survey of
the site for the proposed navy-yard at League Island,
$5,000.
Mr. BUCKALEW. Task that that amend-
ment may be passed for a short time. The
Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Cattell] is
not in his seat.
Mr. MOBRILL, of Maine. I have no objec-
tion.
The PKESIDENT^j'o tempore. The amend-
ment will be passed over, and the next will be
read.
The Secretary. The next amendment is
to strike out lines one hundred and seventy-
nine, one hundred and eighty, and one hun-
dred and eighty-one, as follows:
For the completion of abridge over the Dakota
river and to locate and survey the road from said
bridge to the Vermillion bridge, $1,000.
Mr. HARLAN. I inquire the reason for
striking out this item ?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. It was princi-
pally because the committee had no information
on the subject.
Mr. HARLAN. It is new to me, but I am
of the impression that it is to complete a wagon-
road authorized by a previous act of Congress,
so as to connect with the railroad at Sioux city
and Yancton in Dakota Territory ; and if it be
for that purpose, and be only $1,000. I think
it had better stand.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. That would put
it on too vague a basis for an appropriation of
any kind.
Mr. HARLAN. I ask that it be passed
over for the present until further information
can be had.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Very well. Let
it be passed over.
The PRESIDENT pro tenipore. It will be
passed over. The next amendment will be
read.
The Secretary. The next amendment is
after line one hundred and ninety to insert:
For collection and payment of bounty, prize money,
and other legitimate claims of colored soldiers and
sailors for the fiscal year ending June 30,1870, and
for salaries of asrentg and clerks, $145,000.

agents, $18,000.

The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to strike out from
line two hundred and four to two hundred and
eight, as follows:
To enable the Secretary of the Interior to pay
Vinnie Ream the sum now due her on the contract
authorized by joint resolution approved July28,1866,
for a statue of the late President Lincoln, ยง5,000.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. This sum has
been appropriated in the -legislative, execu-
tive, and judicial appropriation bill, and there-
fore is struck out here.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to strike out from
line two hundred and nine to two hundred and
fourteen, as follows:
For this amount to pay B. A. Shepherd the sum
duo him on a lost check drawn by Robert S. Neigh-
bours, United States special Indian agent, on the 2d
of June, 1S59, on the Assistant Treasurer of the Uni-
ted States at New York city, for supplies furnished
the Indian department, $1,200.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to strike out from
line two hundred and forty-five to two hun-
dred and forty-nine, as follows:
To procure a survey and report, and for repairing
wharf at the site for the navy-yard on the river
Thames, near New London, Connecticut, deeded to
the United States for naval purposes, $10,000; but
no further amount shall be contracted to be paid
for this purpose.
Mr. FERRY. I trust that this amendment
will not be concurred in ; and I would appeal
to the chairman of the Committee on Appro-
priations that he will not insist upon this
amendment after a statement of the circum-
stances under which the appropriation was
placed in the bill by the House of Represent-
atives.
Some two or three years ago an act of Con-
gress was passed inviting the State of Connec-
ticut to purchase and give to the Federal Gov-
ernment a site for a navy-yard or a naval
station on the Thames river near the city of
New London, in Connecticut. The State of
Connecticut accordingly purchased a veryval-
uable site for that purpose and deeded it to
the Government of the United States. Last
year an appropriation for the purpose of mak-
ing a survey and completing the exterior ill-
closures of the station was placed upon an
appropriation bill in the Senate but failed in
the House. Since that time the commandant
of the navy-yard at New York has desired to
make use of this naval station for tho purpose
of transferring to it a portion of the vessels
now crowded together at the navy-yard in New
York and in danger from fire.
The front is about a mile in length, with an
average depth of thirty feet, wharfed to a con-
siderable extent, but the wharf dilapidated and
out of repair, needing at this time repairs for
the purpose of being used for the objects which
I have mentioned.
I ought to add that the Secretary of the Navy
recommended an appropriation of $10,000 last
year, and it failed between the two Houses,
, as I have stated. This year it has been put
\ into the bill by tlie committeo on the part of the
I House and passed by the House. I have here
! a letter from the commandant of the navy-yard
! atNewYork. referringto the facts which I have
| stated. I will read a short portion of it:
"The wharf is wanted, first, for the purpose of
safely securing vessels that aro placed in ordinary
