Major-General ROSECRANS:

The steam ferry belonging to the State penitentiary left Jefferson Thursday morning, manned, piloted, &amp;c., by convicts. She was fired into at Rocheport and taken, after her captain was killed and pilot mortally wounded. Captain Eads, of the Tutt, reports that the commanding officer at Jefferson told him that about 200 rebels crossed near Rocheport during Tuesday night, and that the boat was released the next morning. I forgot to state in former dispatch that on Wednesday noon about 200 guerrillas were concentrating between Waverly and Dover.
