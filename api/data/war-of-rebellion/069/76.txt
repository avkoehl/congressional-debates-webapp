Captain DODGE:

I wish to move my command across the river to Bermuda to-day. Can you furnish transportation? If so, send it over at once.

KAUTZ,

General.

MAY 21, 1864. (Received 9 a. m.)

Will send transportation for your command immediately. Unfortunately, I am using the ferry-boats to transport pontoon-boats and cannot transport your cavalry as rapidly as I could wish.

Secretary of the Navy:

No change in the situation. No news from Richmond. The statement by the special correspondent of the Tribune, professedly written from General Butler's headquarters, that General Butler sent his aide, Major Ludlow, to ask me to co-operatte in the attack on Fort Darling, is entirely untrue. General Bulter never gave me any notice of his intended movement against Fort Darling, and never asked me for any co-operation against Fort Darling. To-day General Butler gave me to understand that his attack on Fort Darling was a feint.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.

NORFOLK, May 21, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:
