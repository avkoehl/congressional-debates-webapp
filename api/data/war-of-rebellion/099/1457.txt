MARCH 23, 1865-12 m.

Colonel G. J. WRIGHT,

Commanding Young's Brigade:

COLONEL: I have just taken three more prisoners of the Fourteenth Corps, which, they say, is certainly moving toward Goldsborough. I presume the force on your front to be simply a strong picket protecting their flank. I am satisifed my report this morning was correct. Your advance is now very near the flank of the enemy's marching column. I have not seen General Logan's scouts since 8 a. m., but hear they are on my left, looking east. I will to down and report when I learn something which may be of importance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ASHBY.
HEADQUARTERS,Moccasin Creek, March 23, 1865-8. 30 p. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I inclose a dispatch from General Wheeler and one from Ashby. * This afternoon I pressed up nearly to the road from Cox's Bridge to Goldsborough, and found everything going to the latter place. We have captured about seventy-five prisoners in all, and they concur in stating that their army is going to Goldsborough. I shall press down to-morrow. Can it be possible that Sheridan is bringing his cavalry here? He was said to have had 6,000 at Charlottesville. If he does come General Lee should send some more to us. He has about 5,000 on the right of his army. We should also have authority to press horses, as many of Butler's men are still dismounted. We need 500 saddles and bridles also.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.
