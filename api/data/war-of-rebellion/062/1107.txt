I have the honor to suggest the propriety of occupying Corpus Christi. The garrison should consist of at least two companies of infantry armed with enfield rifles and two pieces-12 or 24 pounders. This would secure my left flank.

I have the honor to be, your very obedient servant,

JOHN S. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

HOUSTON, March 31, 1864.

Brigadier-General McCULLOCH:

I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to say that information has been received at these headquarters that there are a number of men roaming about in your district, dressed in Federal uniforms, who represent, themselves to belong to Quatrill's command. The major-general commanding is informed that all kinds of outrages are being committed by the devils in the northern districts and by persons wearing uniforms. You will at once cause all of these men to be conscripted and placed in the service, unless can prove satisfactory that they belong to Quantrill's command, in which case they will be ordered to join their command forthwith. You will they will ascertain from Captain Quantrill whether these men are borne on his muster-rolls, and all who are not so borne will be conscripted without delay.
