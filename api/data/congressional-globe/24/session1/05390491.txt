It is believed that as little difficulty exists in
showirs that the purchases from foreign nations

lands reot v< d from the States ot this Union It
is n >t mxvssarv hi re to state an account of debit

partson mav fill into n «u >stt)vHiit part ot this
inquiry It w ill be s uiu-iont to sinwbv what
ui< an  such purcuast s ot lands were etlected
No man at all aequ un ed w ith the historv of this
c mn'rv evi In. is íoranl that Louisiana was pur-
chased from France, and Florida from Spain,
nor that the first cost hrteen, and me latter five
mi'lions ot dollars, without estimating interest,
drfkrenee of exchange, or any other incidental
chirge, nor will it be pretended that they were
not paid tor out of the public Treasurv —out of
tint v'r rv " common Treasury," designed to pro-
rule tor the "common defense" ot the whole
Union, as contradistinguished tiom its separate
parts How, then, can it be pretended that the
money arising from the sale ot the lands acquired
bv<he purchase of Louisiana and Florida stands
i.po i a liferent crmnd with respect to distribu-
tion from momv biought into the Treasury by
taxation- >or can this view of the subject he
too clearly or strongly enforced upon the public
mind
The  present  Constitution  had for its object
the perpetuity of the Union, and for that purpose
conferred   on   the   Federal  Government certain
powers, to be exercised for certain defined and
specified purposes and no others.    Among these
was the power "to levy and co'lect ta ves, duties,
imposts, and excises;" and for what purpose'
" To pay the«lebts and provide for the common
defense and general welfare of the United Slates"
—the " common defense,*'" the general welfare"
of the  United States—that " defense" and that
••welfare," which are "common" and "gen-
eral" to the " United States" as a Confederacy,
as a whole, as contrasted with and distinguished
from its several parts—not that vague common
defense and general welfare understood by some
to confer unlimited power of taxation and appro-
priation upon this Government, but such as may
be provided for and promoted by the exercise of
the powers definitely and specifically granted in
the Constitution, and by no other     If this view
of the subject be correct—and  it is not only in-
tact,  but  believed  to be  intansible—it follows
irresistibly that Louisiana and Florida were paid
for out of the tix fund collected out of the pockets
of the people for certain specified purposes, and,
as an unavoidable consequence, that the public
lands within their limits are bound, by every
principie of lnw and equity, to stand in the place
of the fund from which they were paid for     It
then results in this, that this Government, for the
better  providing for the  common defense and
general welfare, appropriated a portion of the
public money collected from the people in the
purchase of stock, to be thereafter disposed of to
theTkest advantage for thp promotion of thp ob-
jects for which the taxes were raised, and is
therefore the trustee of the people for the faithful
application of the proceeds of that stock for such
purposes, and no other     It is useless to answer,
that as the stock is worth more than the motley
it cost the States are entitled, as bodies politic
and corporate, to the profits by a ratable distri-
bution amonj them     The fund with which these
purchases were made was not contributed by the
States. It was contributed in the form of " taxes,
duties, imposts, and excises," directly by the
people.    How, then, can Congress take a fund,
or the proceeds of such fund, contributed by the
people in their individual character, for certatn
definite purposes, " to provide for the common
defense," &c, and distribute it among the State
governments'    The thing is utterly absurd and
impossible upon any fair constitutional principle.
To close this branch of the subject, it is asserted,
without f<ar of successful contradiction, that as
Congress can alone raise revenue by taxation for
purposes common to the Union, and has appro-
priated a portion of the revenue so raised to the
purchase of lands, that body is, to  that extent,
the trustee of the people, and bound for the faith-
ful application of the whole trust property to the
purposes and objects for which alone the money I
with which it was paid for was r-used                    11
This view of the subject is st.ll more strongly
enforced bv the consideration, that the whole of
the public expenses, ordinal y and extrnoidinary,
nehi ling an amount of public d 'itexc etlmgfour
hundred millions of dollars, hive b<en met and
discharged excltutnehi by the tund raised trom the
pockets of the people by iliuct or indirect tax-
ition This assertion is not too stiong when we
advtrt to the ropoit of tin Secieiaiy of the
Treasury of the 28th of Apul, 18J6, by which
it appeals, that by atair statement of the account
current b< tween the tax fund and the land fund,
technically so called, by the returns rendered up
to the 16th day of the same month of April, the
balance due the land fund was only $3,016,961 63,
not much more than one tenth of the sum now
claimed to be subject to distubution for they ears
1833, 1834, and 1835. What show of justice,
then, would there be in such a scheme of distri-
bution, by w huh the money collect! d from the
people, and paid for public lands, shall be squan-
deied,when received bacl> again fiom the sale
of these lands, among theg-o ,ernme nts of the States
of this Union' The c itch-word has been, that,
as the public revenue had accumulated gieatly
beyond the necessaiy wants of the Government,
let it be returned to the people again by distribu-
tion. Of all the humbugs created in tins age of
invention foi ministering food to political ambition
or pecuniary cupidity, this is the mostpieposter-
ous and absurd ' Distribute money among the
people forsooth ' The scheme is to distribute it
to the regularly-organized State governments It
need not be said that the intention is to corrupt
these governments by giving them an interest at
war with the best interests of the people, but it
requires no exercise of the imagination to per-
ceive that such would be the inevitable result.
Already have we heard it more than whispered
from a quarter most ominous, that if the revenue
shall be so reduced by this notable scheme of
distribution as to produce a deficiency in the
Treasury for defraying the ordinary expenditures
of the Government, the duties on wines will
admit of augmentation, and those on silks be
augmented or restored according as they are
now subject to or free from duty * But what is
the plan of distribution now proposed for our
adoption' As before stated, instead of returning
money to the pockets of the people from whom
it had been previously collected, it contemplates
dividing it among the State Governments. The
cession from Virginia provides that the land shall
constitute a "common fund, ' according to the
"usual proportions of the States in the general
chaige and expenditure, according to the rule es-
tablished by the Articles of Conn deration." The
Fedeial Constitution, in changing the mode of
creating and collecting lcvtnue, íetamed a íule
analogous to that of the Articles of Confedeiation,
by which direct taxes should be apportioned
among the States—the rule of Federal numbers.
While the bill under consideration proposes to
distribute according to this rule, it is not until
fifteen per centum have been previously secured
to the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Alabama,
Missouri, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and to
those at the northwest, the benefits of the expend-
itures already made in building and repairing the
Cumberland road, without any charge or deduc-
tion, except the nominal reimbursement from
the two per cent, fund originally set apart for its
construction. It is true, the Federal Constitution
has set up no standard by which money or other
favors shall be distributed among the States, and
this is of itself sufficient to show that no such
* In Mr Clat's last elaborate speech upon the bill for
distributing the proceeds ot the land sales, he is understood
to have said, that if, m consequence of the distribution peo-
posed, there should not be money in the Treasury to meet
ordinary expenditure", the duties on wines and silks might
be restored or increased This is ominous, but it is not the
only circumstance going to show the connection of his
scheme, and the scheme of Mr Calhoun, with the con-
tinuance and, if necessary, the increase of a high tariff It
ii sufficient to refer to the fact, that the scheme to distribute
dates with the " compromise" tanff act of 1833, intended
by Mr Clay, and so stated by him, was to save, not to
destroy, the protective system If the scheme of distribu
tion, in either form, as presented by Mr Ci a\ or Mr Cal-
hocn, shall be carried, my life on it the tarif will be in
creased and perpetuated
distribution was ever intended by it. But if the
rule of direct taxation is settled, invariable, and,
as far as may be, equitable between the States, it
may be fairly concluded that if, under any cir-
cumstances, a distribution of public money among
them should ever be made, it would be regulated
by the same standard. It is again asserted, that
no rule of distribution of money different from
the one established for regulating direct tavation
could possibly be consistent with the Constitution.
But, in addition, it is fearlessly asserted that, as
the Constitution is a grant of defined and specified
powers to carry into effect objects equally definite,
the power sought to be exercised by this bill is
totally repugnant to its most obvious principles.
It has been asked, what shall be done with the
redundant revenue with which the Treasury is
now overloaded' To the comprehension of a
plain undeistanding there docs not seem to be
much mystery in the matter. If the land fund ir
sufficient to meet the necessary expenditures,
repeal the whole of your taxes. If not sufficient,
repeal a part of them. If moie than sufficient,
repeal the whole of the tariff, and curtail the sale
of the public lands, by limiting it to actual settlers,
and to actual settlers alone; and in connection
with this latter subject, establish an equitable
system of giaduation in the price, according to
the p  nod which the land has remained subject
to entry at the minimum price established by the
Government
It might not be difficult to expatiate upon the
general course of public affans, not only since
the commencement of the present Administration,
but from the adoption of our present form of
Government, but it is not now considered neces-
sary.
On one topic of general discussion, within the
last three yeais, a single remark may not be m-
appropuate Believing, at the time the subject
was fii st investigated in Congress, that the change
of the deposit of the public money from the Bank
of the United States to the local banks was, if
not the wisest, among the wisest acts of General
Jackson's civil administration,subsequent expe-
rience and observation have strengthened and con-
firmed that opinion. And I now as confidently
believe that, if the Bank of the United States had
held the control of the large amount of public
money at the time its charter was about to ex-
pire, which would have been in its possession if
the fiscal agency of the Government had not been
previously taken away from it, the local banks
I would have been crushed, and a scene of pecu-
niaiy distress and ruin created, such as the vvild-
' est imagination would scarcely be able to con-
ceive.
1 Mr DUNLAP said, as the bill from the Senate
embraced the object contemplated by the íesolu-
tion under consideration, and as the time was
near at hand for pioceeding with the oiders of
the day, he would move to postpone the further
consideration of the subject before the House
until Monday next, at which time he should
move to appropriate the three hours which would
otherwise be devoted to the continuation of this
debate, to the consideration of the Tennessee land
bill
Mi HANNEGAN moved to lay the resolu-
tions of the Kentucky Legislature, together with
the instructions, on the table
Mr STORER asked for the yeas and nays;
which were ordered.
Mr. SPEIGHT, in view of the importance of
the motion, proposed that there should be a call
of the House; which was agreed to.
After proceeding a short time with the call,
Mr. MERCER moved that it be suspended, and
after some conversation between that gentleman
and Mr. Speight,
Mr. HANNEGAN remarked that he hoped
the call would be proceeded in, and that they
should have a full House, as the motion which
he had made was intended by him to be a test
vote on the subject of distributing the proceed*
of the sales of the public lands.
The motion to suspend the call was lost, aria
the roll was then called through, as were also the
absentees, when it appeared that one hundred anC
ninety members were in attendance.                ,
Mr HEISTER moved to suspend all further
proceedings under the call; which was agr-d to
