VERMILLION BAYOU, October 13, 1863.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf:

GENERAL: A citizen has just come in from the parish of Saint Landry, and had also traveled about 25 miles on our left flank; he reports that the enemy are between Washington and Holmesville. The most of their wagons and baggage have been sent on to Alexandria. He reports their force at about 10,000 men, under Generals Green, Walker, and Mouton; has seen no armed men on our left flank, and thinks their whole force intend to fall back, if pressed, to Alexandria. Until Sunday, the enemy have had a regular established line of couriers from Vermillionville and Opelousas to the Texas line. Reports that the Texans have driven almost every available negro into Texas. Kirby Smith is at Shreveport, and Governor Moore is also said to be there.

Everything quiet in our front. A train of seventy-five wagons with supplies has arrived from below, all right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[J. SCHUYLER CROSBY,]

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
