SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. RIGHT WING, 16TH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 132. Harrisonville, Mo., October 29, 1864.

I. Colonel William T. Shaw, Fourteenth Iowa Infantry Volunteers, is hereby relieved from the command of the Third Division, Sixteenth Army Corps, and will forthwith rejoin his regiment at Davenport, Iowa. The quartermaster's department will furnish the necessary transportation for himself and authorized servants and horses.

II. In relieving Colonel Shaw from the command of the Third Division prior to his being mustered out, it is but an act of justice to an energetic, through, and competent officer to say that for the last fifteen months he has been in this command as commanding a post, brigade, and division, and in every position has performed the incumbent duties faithfully and well and with an ability that few can equal, with courage, patriotism, and skill. Above question the service loses an excellent [officer] when he is mustered out.

By order of Major General A. J. Smith:

J. HOUGH,Assistant Adjutant-General.
