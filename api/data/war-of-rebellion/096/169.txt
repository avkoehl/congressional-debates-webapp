there very soon. General Sherman was anxiously expecting the troops that were to sail from Baltimore, but nothing had been heard from them. General Terry wanted the residue of his own division to be sent him. Your recommendation of General Terry for brigadier in the regular service will be carried out. While at Fort Fisher I gave him an appointment of full major-general, and wound have also given the brigadiership, but General Townsend says that there is no vacancy. I am sure there is. It was understood at Savannah that Beauregard had gone west to bring down Hood's forces to operate against Sherman.

CITY POINT, VA., January 18, 1865 - 1.30 p. m.

(Received 2.55 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Cannot the troops now in the Department of Virginia, and comprising the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Corps, be named as a grand army corps, or given some name to entitle the commanding officer the staff of a corps commander? I understand the auditors are rejecting the accounts of department staff officers where the department has not a corps organization.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
