CONGKESSTCMAL- frLOM.
January 20,
and adopt the other alternative, and strangle
the Government here in the very sanctuaryof
its power and majesty. "Oh doubter and gain-
sayer!" I hear some ardent friend of read-
mission ask, " have they not repealed the seces-
sion ordinances? Have tliey not adopted the
amendment to the Constitution and' repudiated
tte'reWel debt?" Oh;, yes, -rfith acomniaml of
CtountenariCe and solemnity of visage wMeh,
under tire circumstances, is triiiy rhUWelons.
have1 told all the beads, repeatedall' thre"
aves, and pattered ail the prayers enjoiiited upon
them a?a condition of absolution', butitiswith'iri
the limits of possibility' that they have done all
this to purchase unlimited indulgence to sin;
and not to be invidious in comparisons, I am
told that Ttalian brigands are never so devout
in limeelings, crossings, and paternosters, as
when they are abotitto pltmgfe afresh into crime.
They have ratified'the amendmentto the Con-
stitution, have they? But how have they rati-
fied it? With a construction and gloss upon it
which is more trumpet-tohgUed proof of their
perennial perfidy to the black race than all the
hypocritical mouthings of acquiescence in eman-
cipationwhich could be collected in asix-months'
bunt front Richmond to the Rio Grande. They
have ratified it with a construction that it merely
abolishes the infamy of buying, selling', and own-
ing human beings-; and under the exceptional
clause ("except as a' punishment for crimc")
reconstructed North Carolina is now selling
black men into' slavery for petty larceny, and
reconstructed South Carolina, Mississippi, and
Louisiana are fettering the contract system with
so many subtle formalities, forfeitures, and con-
ditions, that a modern labor contract is much
like an oldLfashioncd slave-penâ€”a trap to hold
the freedman to his work and cheat him of his
wages. It is also true that in equivocal and
guarded language they have repealed the seces-
sion ordinance and repudiated the rebel debt.
But who can have faith ma generation of vi-
pers? The next Legislatures may re'enact, secesj
sion and reaffirm the debt, and I am determined
for one lo accept no botidH for their good be-
havior which they are at liberty either to can-
cel or steal. But the oaths 1 the oaths! They
have sworn oatlis to bo faithful to the Constitu-
tion and to support the laws. Yes, my friend,
they have piled Pelioti upon Ossa 111 the shape
of oaths; hut, alas 1 they have taken all these
oatlisbefore,and on the top of them taken penury
upon their souls; and those Who witnessed their
perjured Senators and Representatives, their
perjured officers, military, naval, and civil, their
perjured judges, and their perjured curs of low
degree, rushing'from the Bible which they had
kissed to the rebel congress and the confederate
camp, will require more irreversible guarantees
from the returning prodigals than those which
end with "so help me God!" Confidence is said
to be a plant of slow growth, and if there is any
kind of confidence which should be longer than
the American aloe in blossoming, it is confi-
dence in any oath which these convictcd oath-
breakers can take.
I have pursued this investigation thus far into
the animus of the inhabitants of the disfran-
chised States by the intuitions of common sense,
with the expectation that this process would
guide us at least to the conclusion that the bur-
den of proof in this case rests most signally
upon those who claim that they are ripe for our
embrace and for the immediate readtnission of
their Representatives to this floor-. 1 was in-
tending next to adopt a more systematic method
of investigation with the hope of showing that
tbe_intuitions of common senseand the process
of inductive investigation mutually fortify and
vindicate the same general conclusions, [was
intending to examine the southern animus as
evinced, first, by their general, local, and muni-
cipal elections; second, by the laws and ordi-
nances which they have passed respecting the
freodmen: third, by the testimony of the special
agent appointed by the President to investigate
their loyalty; fourth, by correspondence from
the infected region: and fifth; bvthe statements
of loyal citizens from the renovated States'; and
I-aftiim that from all these distinct and inde-
pendent sources of information the evidence is
complete and overwhelming that southern loy-
alty consists in submission to necessity, and that
their implacable animosity to the Federal Gov-
ernment, and'to those great nieasureswhicli have
been inaugurated for liberating and enfranchis-
ing the slave, ismertly bidingthe time'when, by
the return to these Halls of its full'coinplement
of Sett&torss and Representatives, the mislbr-
turHjS'of the fleld:may be redeemed in the forum.
But aS'the whole body of la^fs and ordinances
htrve not yet reached' us, the materials for an
exhaustive examination ate riot vet' complete,
and I must" differ' to some future period of the
debate the results of such an investigation. I
can assure gentlemen that' when the results of
such an investigation are brought to the intelli-
gence and conscience of the North, no man can
live who votes for the unconditional admission
of these unregenerate and implacable foes to
any participation in onr legislation here. I am
thankful that my feeble voice has been permit-
ted at this early day to sound the alarm.
I have thus, Mr. Chairman, defined my view
of the relation of these insurgent States, as de-
termined by public law and by the Constitution, -
to this Government. I have indicated with-
out vindicating the constitutional muniments
which will be required to defend' the cause we
have \Von when "public enemies" shall be
joined with usin executing our sacred trust. In
doing this I have stated some of the principles
which will govern me in this momentous crisis
of my country's history. Guided by them, I shall
enter the dark and portentous-cloud which"is
still lowering before us without fear, with great
hope, but with 110 certainty. Upon the God of
nations and the invincible strength of northern
freemen we must still rely to make our deliv-
erance sure.

1 really did not intend to speak so long as I have
to-day. Butif the House will indulge me by ad-
journing now, and permitting me to conclude
my remarks on Monday, 1 shall be very much
obliged, and will be able, I am certain, to fin-
ish then in' about thirty minutes all 1 have to
say. It must be evident from my voice that I
am not in a condition to proceed now.
Mr. DAWSON. I will move that the com-
mittee now rise, with a view to allow the mem-
