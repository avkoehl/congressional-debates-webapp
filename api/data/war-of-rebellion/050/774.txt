which the enemy advanced. We fired one volley by battalion, and then retired slowly, halting, facing about, and firing by battalion as soon as the regiment had loaded and effectually holding the enemy in check in our front. Finally the advance of the enemy of the left having been checked, and the troops to whose support we had been sent having been reformed on a ridge in our rear, the regiment again moved off to the left and joined the rest of the brigade. It was now sundown, and our part in the engagement for the day was ended. The regiment bivouacked for the night in the first line on a ridge on the east side of the road, and maintained the same position on the 20th till about 3 p.m. A small parapet of logs, hastily constructed on the morning of the 20th, enabled us to repel two assaults on the position during the day without loss to ourselves.

About 3 p.m. it was moved to the right, to the support of a portion of Harker's brigade, Wood's division, which was in position on the crest of a hill which the enemy was endeavoring to carry. The possession of the hill was maintained, the regiment losing about a dozen wounded in this part of the action. As soon as it became dark we withdrew from this position, marched to Rossville, where the regiment bivouacked, and on Monday morning again went into position in the first line on Missionary Ridge, throwing up a parapet of rails and covering our front with skirmishers. The enemy soon afterward engaged our skirmishers, and later in the day opened with one piece of artillery, evidently for the purpose of feeling our position. The main line, however, did not become engaged, and at night we were again withdrawn, and the next day took up the position in the present line, which we now occupy. The following is the list of casualties.*

Total killed: Enlisted men,6; wounded, commissioned officers, 5; enlisted men, 95; missing, enlisted men,9. Aggregate: Killed,6; wounded, 100; missing,9.

Number engaged commissioned officers, 23; enlisted men, 337. Aggregate, 360.

Lieutenant-Colonel Kimberly had 2 horses and Major J. H. Williston 1 horse wounded and disabled in the engagement. My own horse was killed. I cannot speak too highly of the gallantry and fortitude of both officers and men, nor of the enthusiasm that two days' hard fighting and their thinned ranks failed to depress. My thanks are especially due Lieutenant Colonel R. L. Kimberly and Major J. H. Williston, as well for their untiring vigilance and zeal, as for their gallantry in action. Lieutenant Fisher, acting adjutant, deserves and has my thanks for promptness in communicating orders under severe fire. Late on the 19th, he was severely, and it is supposed mortally wounded, while going to the rear to bring up ammunition. He is supposed to be in the hands of the enemy. Lieutenant J. N. Clark performed the duties of adjutant during the remainder of the engagement, and deserves mention for zeal and gallantry. Among company officers, while I can commend all for their cheerful and steady courage throughout the engagement, Lieutenant C. W. Hills deserves special mention for deliberation and coolness, which attracted my attention in the heat of the engagement on Saturday, and for the obstinacy with which he held his ground on Monday, while commanding a line of skirmishers that was vigorously attacked by the enemy. Corporal Strock, of Company E, also deserves
