OFFICERS OF BOWDOIN, LAROCQUES & BARLOW,

New York, October 11, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, &c.

SIR: I have by mail to-day from Old Point a letter from the Honorable Alfred Ely dated at Richmond, September 20, urging me to apply to certain personal friends in Virginia in hi behaf, and I have another similar letter from another prisoners in confinement there. While I fear it is out of my power to be of much service to these gentlemen I will exert any influence that I may have in their behalf on being informed that a correspondence strictly limited to this object is not objected to by my Government.

I have the honor to be, sir, yours, very respectfully,

SAMUEL L. M. BARLOW.

DETROIT, October 11, 1861.

Honorable F. W. SEWARD, Esq.,

Assistant Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.

DEAR SIR: * * * I sent Da Costa forward Wednesday, 9th instant, evening train; he arrives at New York this a. m. A. G. Davis called here last Saturday and left Tuesday for Halifax. There should be a man at Toronto and Collingwood, Canada West. I must have help; it is taking up too much of my time.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. BARSE.
