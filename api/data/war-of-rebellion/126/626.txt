In accordance with section 13 of the act, the Secretary of War, on the 30th of June, 1863, announced that the amount to be paid by any person who might be drafted, in order to secure exemption from service, was $300.

Fifty-two thousand two hundred and eighty-eight of those examined under this draft and found liable and fit too perform military duty secured exemption by paying $300 each.

A fund of $15,686,400 thus accrued under this draft, and, being appropriated by section 13 for the procuration of substitutes, it was used as hereinafter explained under the had of "Call of October 17, 1863."

The large proportion of exemptions defeated, in a measure, the object of the law, and a modifications reducing the causes of exemption was urgently demanded by the public exigencies of that period. The necessity for a change having been demonstrated by actual test and practical experience, the more rigid features subsequently introduced as amendments to the law were accepted by the people generally, and added nothing to the difficulties encountered in carrying out the measure.
