THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 16,
the habits, customs, and legal rights of the people
of all the South He wished tnem to see wnat
those opinions and feelings were, and therefoie,
and for that only, he should vote for printing the
memorial
Mr JOHNSON, of Louisiana, hoped that the
motion to reconsider would prevail, and that the
memorial would be la.d on the table He repu-
diated the inteifeienee of the northern with the
rights and property of the people of the southern
States Whenever the North should succeed in
procurmglegislation by Congress in regard to these
rights and this species of propel ty, that moment
the Unnn would be dissolved
Mr BOON said,as he had asked for a division
of the question, and belonged to a non slavehold
mg State, it was perhaps proper that he should
say a word or two There was no person more
opposed to slavery than himself, but while he was
opposed to the principle, he was also opposed to
interfering with those rights to property, winch
were guarantied to thecitizens of particular States
and districts by the Constitution of the United
States It would be recollected that this question,
when the subject of the admission of Mibsoun
into the Union was before the House, had come
very near dividing the Union He thought the
same course which had been adopted by the gen-
tleman from Mabsachusetts, [Mr Phillips,] in
presenting a sirnilai memorial this morning, which
was to move that it be laid on the table, was Ihe
proper one, and that this memonai should be dis-
posed of in a similar manner
Mr FILLMORE said, as it was understood that
the Committee on the District of Columbia would
not act upon this sub]ect at the present session, it
was cei tamly due to the petitioners that the motion
which had been made by his colleague [Mr Dick-
son] should prevail It was not umeasonable
that the memorial should be printed and preserved
among the documents of the House He dis
avowed most unequivocally, now and forever, any
desire on his part to interfere with the rights, or
what was termed the property, of the citizens of
other States While he did this, he conceived
that, as a citizen of the State of New York, and
a member of this Hoube, he was interested in the
claim to property in man, within the District of
Columbia He referred to the effect which was
produced in the North by the adveitisements in
the papers of this city, connected with the pui-
chase and transportation of slaves The people
of that section of the country believed slavery to
be improper, and that it should not be toleiated
This was a gieat national question There was
nothing in the memorial which should prevent its
being printed and placed on the files of the House
foi future íeferenoe Whenever petitions should
be presented here from the slaveholdmg States,
of a different tenor, and which might advocate
the establishment or continuance of slave markets
in the District and city, if they  ould satisfy the
people of other sections that this was proper, he
would treat their petitions with respect He was
willing that each party should be fully heard, and
that each bhould have the privilege of spreading
their views before the people generally
Mr McKINLEY regretted that this discussion
had sprung up He thought it manifested more
7eal than prudence He inquired if the printing
was intended to enlighten the House or the coun-
try' It was admitted on all hands that no action
was to take place upon this subject at this session
That being the case, what object would be attained
by printing this memorial' He considered it one
of the most imprudent memorials which had ever
been read in this House It was a fire brand from
one of the noithern States, which had been thrown
into this House, and he was, for one, opposed to
giving it any publicity He denied that this
House had the right to lay their hands upon his
property, let him live where he might There
was no disrespect intended to the memorialists
by íefusmg to print their memorial It had been
received by the House, and that, he contended,
was suffirient Nothing more ougnt to be ex-
pected He cared not whe her it had come from
a mayor of a ci'y or the Piesident of the United
States     He should oppose the motion to print
Mr  PARKER was at a loss (he said) to pel
eive how the mere reading and punting of ti e
memorial could produce unpleasant feelings in
that House or in the nation at large, nor was it,
in his opinion, calcjlated to throw a fire-brand
into the slaveholdmg States It appeared to him
to be more like a respectful address to the House,
calling upon them to exercibe the undoubted pnv
lieges conferred upon it by the Constitution of
legislating for the District of Columbia, in lemov-
ing what the petitionerb cons dered a great and
existing grievance, and if it wa& intended ui wished
to prevent any debate it could be easily obviated
by withdrawing the question of reconsideration
What was the state ot the subject, what hud been
done heretofoie, and how did the matter then
stand' A poition of the people of this country
considering the evil a national one—as one that
ought not to be tolerated by a fiee people—íe-
spectfully ask that House to take measures to
redress the eiils Petitions of this nature have
been refeired to the committee intrusted with the
management of the a ff lira of the Distnct, not only
the present session, but the last and several pie-
cedmg sessions Now, the prayer of the petition
was either right 01 wrong, and then reasons either
forcible and conclusive or otherwise Let, then,
the Committee on the District of Cdumbia mike
a lepoit, and tell us what they think ought to be
done, and give us their reasons, so that the House
might judge of the question Mi P was not
prejudiced one way or the othei, but he thought
an answer to the piayer of the petition should be
given, for it was neither unlawful nor unrighteous
The argument of his honoiable fuend fiom Ala-
bama [Mr McKinley] that Congress hod no ngnt
to interfere, Mi P could not assent to so leadily
Let that gentleman, who was fully competent to
give his reasons, give his reasons on this subject
For himself, in accordance with the wishes and
opinions of his constituents and the persons pre
senting this memorial, he should feel it his bounden
duty to vote to put their petition upon the files of
the House, and he should continue 10 uige it with
all the zeal of which he was capable, at the same
time with all due consideration to the feelings,
prejudices, interests, and rights of otheio, and
which they were entitled to require at his hands
This he should do until the Committee on the
District of Columbia, or some other select com-
mittee of the House, answered the question, and
told us, at the same time giving their reabons,
whether Congress had a right to legislate on this
subject or not, and until the House had concuired
m that decision
Mi DICKSON then withdrew that pait of the
motion proposing to punt the names of the sub-
scribes to the memorial
Mr CLAY said He was even more opposed
to the printing of the memorial itself than he was
to printing the names appended to it, which he
legatded as a mattei of little consequenceeompared
with the other He was decidedly opposed to the
publication of such a document In spite of all
the fair professions heard there upon the subject
as to any non interterence with the rights, inter-
ests, and property of the southern States, or any
other prooeity of this kind, gentlemen must be
forgetful of the domestic policy and everything
else concerning the peace and tranquillity of those
States, when they ask for the printing and publi-
cation of a document like the one under considera
tion Are these gentlemen ignorant that the print-
ing and pubhsning of documents of this kind in
almost all the southern States are prohibited under
high and heavy penalties' and would they com-
pel, or at least sanction, the publication of docu-
ments by Congress, fordoing which, if a southein
tribunal could lay then hands upon a printer doing
the same on his individual i espons bility, he would
be treated and punished as a culpnt' Do they
call this non interference with the rights of prop
erty where slavery prevailed ' Gentlemen might
disclaim any intention of interfering with this sub
ject, but when he heard such diso'aimers as those
made by the gentleman from New York, covered
by so thin a veil as he had employed, Mr C
could not yield his assent to them Ihegen'leman
told us that this was a subject he had no intention
of interfering with, whileat fVsameUmehecal'ed
it a gieat national question, ard consequently one
that ought to be aguated in tnat House Was it
not a subjecta sd Si wh ch S3L*hernpe -'«should
decidedly protest' And was it not one calculated
to excite the most direful calamities in that] onion
of the Union whence Mr C and many of nis
friends came'
Mr C had no lies tation in giving an unqthfied
contradiction to tne supposition that it was the
wish of the intelligent and enlightened cnizens of
the northern and middle Stales to agnate this ques-
tion It was confined to a few fanatics urged and
guided by theGamsons, theTappans, and others,
their wire workers,who had recently attracted pub
he attentio i, and whose obj°ct was wall known
He did not, he could not, bung himself to believe
that it was the wish of the great mass of the
population of the New England or Middle Sta'ea
to bung on this matter Weie we to be to'd,
because a hardful of mnatics, who were readv to
light the torch of disaffection and civil discoid
through the country, were moving on this subject
that it was mattei connected with Ihe natiop_l
prosperity, 01 that it was a battel of right to that
description of individuals, to discuss and agitate
the subject m that House' The gentleman fro n
New Jersey [Mr Paukek] called upon the com
mittee for the District of Coljmbia to report on
the subject, m ordei that it mig it Le discussed nrd
investigated Why that was the very couu>e of
proceeding calculated to produce the evils con
templated, evils of such a character as no good
citizen in any part of this wide spiead and exten
sive Union ought for a moment todesire Mr O
would inquire, how came it that tiatwas a matter
of such concern to those mdivik.1.?Js' Did it
interfere with their domestic policy, their domestic
lights, their liberty, their prooeity, 01 their secui
Hy, in any point of view' He was at a loss to
]]erceive how it cou'd Why was it, then, that
those peisons sought to interfere with the domestic
policy of others' It could not be denied, that this
was a matter of domestic right and policy, an J on
what grounds, then, could they find tnemselves
wananted 01 justified in interfeiing to give direc
tion to that policy' It was a matter that con-
cerned not them, either individually, 01 as a com
munity Until the com nittee foi the Distuct of
Columbia, or some other committee, should repoi t,
the gentleman from New Jersey tells us he should
hold himself ready and willing to receive and print
all memorials on the subject But had the people
of the District called upon Congress to leg slate
on the subject' They had not and why shou'd
Congress be called upon by others to give a new
direction to the domestic policy of others, with-
out consent fust obtained' That doctrine was
contrary to any expressed wish of theirs The e
petitioners might, with equal piopnety, memornl-
lze the Legislature of Vngmia, or the Legislatute
of any other State, and call upon them, in the
name of national honor, to reverse their policy,
and abolish trie laws authorizing the holding of
property of this kind
Mr C , in conclusion, said, for his own part,
after the admission, which seemed to have been
made on all hands, that this was a matter belong *
mg to the people holding this pecahar species of
property, and after the disclaimer that had been
made of non interference, and in the absence of
any petition from the inhabitants of the Dist-ictof
Columbia, and without any call on the partof any
of the States where propel ty of this kind existed,
he did think that these gentlemen ought rot to
press this subject, in aryform wnatever, upon the
consideration of the House
Mr C P WHITE moved to lay the motion to
reconsider, and the memorial itself, on the table
On a question from Mr WISE, some conver-
sation aioseon the pointwhether, if themotion to
lay on the table prevailed, the motion to print,
which had been announced by the Chair as
adopted, would be consdeied and recorded as
adopted' Mr WISE, Mr J Q. ADAMS, and
Mr BRIGGS, participated therein
The CHAIR said it was a matter not entirely
belongirg to him, but as the question had been
put to him, he should say that the C'erk of the
House could not order the memorial to be printed,
inasmuch as there would be, if the motion to lie
on the table prevailed, a motion pending *o re-
consider the vote to print tne memorial The
motion to lie on the table prevail ng would not
finally dibpose of ti e mattei, because the House
