WHEELING, January 9, [1862].

Captain G. L. HARTSUFF, [Assistant] Adjutant-General.

SIR: I have the honor to inclose a list* of prisoner of war now at CAmp Chase, Ohio, captured in arms against the United States Government and subject to exchange for those of our troops taken by the rebels in Western Virginia.

I presume that arrangements can be made by the proper Department at Washington City for the exchange, or it might be advisable to effect it through a flag of truce sent to Winchester or some other post in Virginia in possession of the rebels.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH DARR, Jr.,

Major First [West] Virginia Cavalry, Provost-Marshal.

SIR: The list of prisoners for exchange comprises two first lieutenants, one second liuetenant and ninety-two privates.

Second Lieutenant Hurt, of the Pittsylvania Cavalry, informed me at Camp Chase that he felt confident his connections in Virginia had influence enough with the rebel leaders at Richmond to effect his exchange for Lieutenant Merrill, captured at Cheat Mountain.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH DARR, Jr.,

Major First [West] Virginia Cavalry, Provost-Marshal.
