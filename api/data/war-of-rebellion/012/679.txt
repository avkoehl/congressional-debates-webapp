Have this moment heard from F. J. porter, with his division. He has taken hanover Court-House. Little loss on our side; many killed, wounded, and prisoners of rebels. Captured one of their guns. The enemy made another stand at railroad, out of which our men were driving them at date of dispatch. Rebels, 13,000 in number, commanded by General Branch. The expedition promises perfect success in all its objects, which you will now readily divine. Porter has cavalry and horse artillery to follow up.
