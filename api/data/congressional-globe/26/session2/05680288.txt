26th Cong------2nd Sess.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr.  Wise.
H. of Reps.
tariff, or to increase the tariff to ■mike a pretext for dis
trtbulvng the revenue from lands
These several reasons I propose to discuss in
limine To discuss them as I hive considered
them, on mature deliberation.
I say, sir, first, "as a fruni of the coming Mini
nislratton."
Would any one have supposed three months ago,
when I was seen bearing the beat and burden of
the late election campaign—six years ago, when,
from that tuns to this, I have been bearing the
brunt of the colossal tyranny of the two last Ad-
ministrations—that I—I should have, two months
before the next Administraron comes m—when all
ihe energies I exerted to bring it in are not yet re-
laxed—to defend myself agiinst the imputation of
not being its friend'!
[Here Mr Stanlt said across, "There is no ne-
cessity for you to do that."]
Mr. Wise. One of my friends says there is no
necessity for'such a defence I know there is not
with those who know me But there are
many who do not know me. Some foe-friend or
friend-foe may know perhaps that General Ham-
son himself does not know me, and I will show
that there is a necessiiy lor this defence
In the Richmond Enquirer ot the Will msiant,
containing a letter from Washington, dated the 14th
mstRiit, is the following nunifieanf queie-
"Would you be surprised to find Wiseamongst the opponents
of the new Admmibiiationi ihingsmue mprobable than
thlshavc occurred He is in a teiribic rti^e it the piospect of
Kivos's election '
This, sir, is the insidious and ial*e dealing of the
fos This was to be expected from this quarter,
and to show how little this source of slander knew
about me or my acts, I have only to appeal to my
friends in the Virginia Legislature, who did me the
honor to eon ult with me on the subject, to prove
that, TO far from my being "in a terrible rage at
the prospect of Mr Rives'-, election " 1 adviv-d
those who had ever once voted for turn lo vo r fur
bis elecuon agau , and that, too upon tin express
ground that it would be seeming treachery in the
Whiff party now not to < l< ct him, at th< same ti ne
declaring, however, that, nev<r having voted fot
his election inysrli, / never would if I were m
the Legislature, no, net "until tin cow came
home "
But this imputit on oi my being a renegade did
not originate with my old political fots alone My
real friends have told me that some Whigs had bi-
guá to feign to fiel a suspicion That some "busy
bodie>," no doubt with fie deepest interest in m^,
have been whispering Ihi wuendo, ' He is erratic,
and delights in opposition, no wond-i if he is soon
against us1" Sn, let me inform such fiends that
they are seen and known Once foi all, I pro-
nounce the charge that I am no' a sincere and <'t-
voted fnrnd of the coming AdminiMraiion—no
matter whethsr it be made by ,i Loin Foco, from
motive"! of policy to drive me into ins own mino-
rity for vengeance sake on account of the paid, oi
by a mahuous Whig hyp ente, to destroy an in'
fluenee, much or little, in the way of his own
preferment m future—abuse and unfounded slan-
der
This much I feel con trained t > say—not to se
cure a personal b"ne(it or to prevent a personal n
jury, but to relieve my argument , my compel, and
my course wiih my party in man unj >st preju lie.
Let him who doubts wheiher I am a tr end (I the
Whig cause arid of a Whig Administratis, sian I
up and how his face' L-t me see whether he is
one who has, djrmg an sight jearV war, been side
by side with me in the forlorn hope against the
hosts oí spnleis, or whether he is one of tbore
"eleventh hour" men who have come io*o tne Whig
ranks just m time to share the spoils La me see
his stupes, his persecution , his toils, and hi=
sufferings and sacrifices, and compare them with
mine, and then I can tell whether he be a better
Whig than / am
Sir, who has the right to question my being a
Whig1! Who—what one man is it who claims to
be the Whig party, with power to excommunicaie
mel I think I have the right to claim to be the
Whig party as much as any otbrer one man in the
ranks, and gentlemen had better beware ¡est they
be unchurched themselves before they unchurch me
One of the richest frut'sofour late triumph is, I
ho, e, the restoration of perf ct frtedom of thought and
independence of action I do not admit that I am
acting contrary to my party, but if gentlemen op-
posed to me are the parly, let me tell them at once
that I will submit to no party dictation If the
"screws''' axe to be applied so soon, they will find
one Saul "kicking against the pricks"—especially
at this time, before the President elect has even
reached the metropolis, and before I know that he
will approve of a single line of policy which some
seem so anxious to prescribe for him Who here
undertakes to «speak for him1) He will speak for
himself, sir, and may agree with me, and differ with
gentlemen In what sort of a predicament will
they be then' Who, then, will be the party? With
those very gentlemen themselves, sir, J will b- apt
to be the party then, and nine out of ten of them
will acknowledge that I am right, and they are
wrong.
Sir, that there was a great variety of opinions
in the Whig party was  known before the election
That party was the opposition, and the opposition
alwajs unites discordant materials    The party in
power alone can amalgamate its friends into one
mass of sentiment and  feeling    A  party coming
into power usually, in taking its direction of pol -
cy, dissatisfies a poition of those who brought it m,
sloughs them off, and form1' new allies from old
opponents to su | ply the defecfon    This was the
caee with the party which brought Genaral Jack-
son into power    He gained friends from among
old Federalists faster iban he lost Repi blicans, who
placed him in the Presidency    This is not the first
time I have been m a large majority,  and it  was
not until the fifih year of the  reign of Andrew
Jackson that I depatted from him, after the bad
company   had increased too  strong for my tas'e
around  the throne    During  the   late   contest I
urged "a union of the Whigs "    I do so sti'l.    I
deoire nolhin' ^o much as general and frequent
consultation—caucus   coimdiat on,   if   jou   will,
imong ourselves, to $e ll   the  points upon which
we agree,and to 'Vgree to f'i agree"on th se vexed
questionv which «o ousht   lo  avoid     Befo-e the
election it made no difference with me, sir, whether
you were a  Republican Wh g, a National Republi
can, oi a Nullifier    To each I gaie the, hand of
fellowship cordia'ly, and united heartily witu all to
pull down a rotten dyna-ty, worse than an> which
can beestaolished.    We knew oui differences be-
forehand, and each took the chance of his faith and
his policy becoming the prevailing faith and policy
with the new Admmtsiration     Believing General
Harrison to be a Republican of the old scho >1, as I
believe s'ill, an 1 shall not belu ve otheiwise  until
he hi'nself undecive* ne, I  un ted wi h all mv
energy an^ all mv j-t-al fo pa  him   nti place anf
powei     indeed, if I had mown he cas noi of nw
faith—if 1 h d txpected  to om ose 1 is A ¡ministra
tion the moment ifier he goe    <nti  power, still I
would have   supposed   h m   agiinst  the  pr sent
"powers that be," beciuse "ihe country mig/sf be
benefited and could wit be wonted "   But   sir, I
knew that, aftei he came in, there wou d be a race
between his different supporters as  to   vhose faith
and policy should be pursued.   I i'id not exp ct
tb^t race to start before the inauguration but it h-s
begun.    I tvoulil have avoided  it "=0 soon, forever
il I could but it is on the trick, and  tne contest
must bt   encountered     If one set if 'nends are
busy to engrafi their cree i unon  th  Administra-
tion st ck, so must the others be, unle s they mean
to desert their pnncip'es and to b<" merged in  what
will soon get to be called—"thepctr/y "   I will not
desert mv principles, sir, and w 11 do all in my pow-
er to advance  their pre-eminence  over all others.
Gentlemen must pardon me for this position, when
I have caught them fi- t in precisely the same act
Neither of us can say at yet uhich is "the party"
until the President hmselfarrives and decides between
us
I am myself, sir, m favor of the Republican po-
licy There is no prefix to my poliiical name—it
has neither "National" or "Stat  Rights" attached,
bat is simply "Republican " Mr Madison has
ever been the model of statesmen with me, and I
am content to follow his examples of wisdom and
virtue, And, sir, I will proceed to tell you what I con-
ceive ore of the Republican tenets to be One espe-
cially which 1 shall expect the President to observe
is, that he will not be ruled by a party I repeat it,
that I shall expect him not to be ruled by a party' If
he is, the country will be misruled, as it has been for
twelve years past.
Sir, the late contest resulted precisely as I desired
it One of the greatest achievements of the vic-
tory ,s, that it was not a party triumph It was a
great and glorious national triumph Gentlemen
of the party in power wonder how they were de-
feated They are astonished at the number of
votes polled—at the increase of votes approaching
nearly one million. Sir, I can tell them the reason
of this, there is in this country a corps de reserve of
wisdom, virtue, and sterling worth and patriotism,
who do not usually mingle in the excitement ot
po'itics—who avoid the dust of the electioneering
arena, ar-d who only come up to the help of the
nation, to the rescue of the country, when there is
a crisis of real danger That crisis had come, and
this corps of moral power stepped forth and de-
cided the struggle Old men, whe'her aristocrats
or poor, who had no* been seen at the polls for
twenty years, came forth—the old, young, lame,
hilt, blind, rich and poor, of all classes and condi-
tions—who had been merely looking on at the po-
liticians and taking no part wi'h th-m, but observ-
ing the events and the tendencies of causes only,
heretofore—all alike feeling the pressure of neces-
sity, the call for ac'ion—all by the impulse of pa-
triotism, not of party, sprang forward to save, to
preserve, and relieve our people and their institu-
tions This, sir, this was the grace and gladness
■and glory of the late contest for the Presidency
What thtn is the duty of the President elect? It is
to be President of the nation, not if a party' Yes,
sir, to be President of the Loco Focos themselves
— o be their „ervant as well as the servant of
Whigs—a benefactor and blessing to all, to the
tvhole country. So lo be Pi esident tint even those
who voted against hi.n shall exclaim—"it is good
for us to hove such a man elected, ana for the Re-
pub i' ns to sjcceed1"
Some gentleman  whispers  that  I  "expect tco
much from the President "
[Here Mr Mis s of Oiio rose and said, "No,
too mach from Government '"]
Mr Wi e No, I reverse the maxim of "the
Government " i will expect every thing, and the
nation must never imagine that we can expect too
much from the wisdom and virtue ot their rulers
The very expectation s r, w 11 exalt ?nd qualify
them to meet our highest ho| e  Now the experi-
ment is ¡o b° tr ed, and Í hope it will be the enly
expenmeit f ihe new 4dm lustration, whether a
pure an 1 vi uous and eidigMenc1 Admimsfra'ion
—locking one to thecoontiy andi'S busines', not
impolitic-—ti'l be sustained bv popuhr (avor
S r, I hope to see that experiment made, and to s-e
it succe^sfu' Nothing short of its success can
save this coimtr> from in fatal end of all Repub-
lics I deiue to see General Harrison, above all
things, jm tuethat godlike virtue tf Wash ngton,
which advised, and consul'ei with, and tool, counsel
from good men of all parties and all cree Is—
which heard and compared the opinions of all the
goo' ai>i the greet in the land—which had a
Hamilton and Jefferson both m 'h« Cabinet, ard
consul ed bit1)—and wh eh, aiter weighing and rt-
flectmg pr"fou">dly, decid d firm'y and without
shrinking from responsJjiU } Believing that he
will bear all, govern all, be the P^idem of all—
that h' possesses the v rtues which qualify him to
govern and to fill the ofric for which I was and
am his friend—I shall vote to entrust him suh the
means immediately and absolut ly necessary to
carry on the Government, after the 4th of March,
until the next regular «ession of Congress
And now, sir, I have a word to say to -he friends
of the Adm mstration yet m power You should
do as \on have been done by You should in good
faith assist in providing those m=ans for the com-
ing Administration which you have for years been
providing for j ourselves It is pi Ucy in you to do
so, or the blame, if any, will fall on your majority
in both Houses of the present Congress Yon
have, s nee September, 1837, passed no less than
four, and this will be five, Treasury note bills to
