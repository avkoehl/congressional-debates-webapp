ROME, July 5, 1864.

Brigadier General J. E. SMITH:

A rebel soldier captured reports that Friday morning fifty of Wheeler's cavalry scouts left Cedartown destined to the railroad near Calhoun or Resaca; expects to form a junction with Hart's (Sixth Georgia) cavalry. He says this force is prepared with torpedoes to blow up trains; he reports also that Pillow is to act in concert with an additional force. This statement has come to me through two sources.

A deserter from the rebel lines this morning came into my camp and informed me that 5,000 or 6,000 rebels, under Forrest and Wheeler, are now encamped on Sand Mountain near mouth of Raccoon Creek.
