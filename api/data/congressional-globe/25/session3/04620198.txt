Q5?b Cong....3d Sess.
Public Lands—Mr. Harrison.
Ho, of Reps.
Commonwealth hath to the territory or tract of oountrv
tv tina the limits of tlie Vngima ctmter, «ituate,, lvmg,and
being to the northwest of the nver Ohm, subject to the
terms and conditions contained in this before recited act of
Congress of the I3th day of ¡September Inst, that is to say,
upon condition that this territory so ceded shall be 1 ud out
and formed into States, containing a suitable extent of ter
ntory, not less than one hundred, nor more than one han
dred and fifty miles sqfiart , or as near thereto as circmn
htances will admit, and that the tomes so formed shall be
distinct republican States, and admitted member  of the
Federal Union, having the same lights of sovereignty, free
dom, and independence, as the other States "
What was that juusdiction before the cession?
When the propeity, and in possession of the
State of Virginia, it was full, complete, and ab-
solute No othei power could limit, restrict, or
jnterfeie with it Where is it now ? Does the
General Government possess it as full and abso-
lute as Virginia had it before the cession 3 No,
sir None will venture to advance such doctune
Where is it then? It was a thing that existed
before the cession, and it must still cxibt some-
where If it be not found with the General Gov-
ernment, it must be with the States, and if with
the States, how came it there ? By compact3
By any arrangement or undemanding between
the General Government and the States' None
of these. It fell to the States as one of the le-
eerved rights. By the magical influence of sovci
eignty it attached itself to the powers of the State*?
as being one that was not delegated to the Gen-
eral Government In refeience to juusdiction as
an attribute of soveieignty, Vattel, m his book
on the laW of nations, says
' The general domain of the nation over the lands she
inhabits is naturally connected with the empne , for, >n e 
tabhshmg liert-ell in a vacant country, the n mon certainly
does not intend to possess it m subjection to any other
Power, and can we suppose un independe nt nation not
vested with the absolute command in hei domestic ton
cems?   Thus we have already observed (hook I, sec ,20 >)
that m taking possession of a country, the nation is pie
mimed to take possesion oí its government at the sumo
time     We shall here proceed further, and bhow the nam
ral connection of these two rights man mdtpendtnt na
tiOn    How could she govern herself, at íu r own pit tisiin ,
in the country she inhabits, ¡f she c tin not trulv mid nhso
lately dispose ot it?   And how could slits havt tin tut I and
absolute domain of a place win re blie bus not tlie com

the debates of the Vngmia Convention on the
adoption of the Fedeial Constitution, speaking
on the subject of giving up the navigation of tht
Mississippi, says
' France has gu ir mtied to us our sovereignty and alt its
appendages VVhu are its appt tidalesJ Art not tht riv
<*rs and waters that wa«h tht shores of a country append
ages inseparable from the right of sovereignty I '
Governor Randolph, in the same debate, said
"It will, moreover, le contrary to the law of nations to
rclirquisk territorial rights "1 here is a prohibition natti
rally resulting from the nature of things, it being contradi
tory and repugnant to reason and the law of nature and na
twns to yield the most valuable right of a community, Jor
the exclusive benefit of one pa) t of it "
Mr  Nicholas aUo said
i( The deprivation of torn tonal nghts was obviously re
pugnant to the law of nations "
But, sir, I have still other authority of a high
character, bearing directly on the point, to which
I would particularly call the attention of the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr Parker,] who
was a member of the select committee to whom
this subject was referred, as the authority I am
about to read is a decision of the supreme court
of the State of New York, delivered by Chief
Justice Spencer.   The case was this: a murder
was committed at Fort Niagara, lying within- the
limits of the State of New York The man was
tried for the murder, found guilty, and sentenced
according to the laws for the cume he had com-
mitted. The case was taken up to the supreme
couit, upon the ground that the State aulhonties
had no jurisdiction of the case, inasmuch as the
cume was committed at a place which was tbe
property of the United States I will now read
that part of the decision which relates to the
point in question*
" T heir possesion of this post must be regarded, thete
fore, as a possession for the State, not against it it was a
tnemlly occupation, trot m derogation oí our rights, and
we regard it as a. mnd unent it pnnciph tint the rights ot
sovereignty are never to be taken away by implication in
tin else ot the United States us tievans,(3 Wheatou,3ó8 )
( hicf J list ice Marsh ill said ' The power of exelusive legis
lition undtr the eighth sretion of the fir t article ot the
Constitution which is jurisdiction is united with ctsston
oi territory, whit h is to be the free act of the States ' J he
correctness oí this íemark is fully admitted, and if the Uni
ted States had the right ot exclusive legislation over the
lortress of Niagara, they would have also exclusive juiis
diction , but we are of opinion tint the right of exclusive
legislation within tlie territorial limits of any St ite c in be
acquire d by the United Suites only in the mode pointed out
in tin Constitution—ly -purchase by consent of the Legisla
ture of the St ite in which the same ¡.hall be for the erection

rights ot the United Stitt« beyond the limits or bomidarn s

Now, an, I would ask if anything could be
stiongcr, oi moie dnectly in point than this which
I have just icad The coutt not only takes the
ground that theie is but one way in which the
Government can acquire or hold lands within the
hmtts of a State, which is by consent of the
State, but also, that this acquivtiun must be J >t one

II      To understand this rightly, we must go back
to the time when the articles of Confederation
weic the paiamount law of the land, and look at
the state of things that existed at this paiticular
peuod of our histoiy The eighth aiticle of the
Aitides of Confedeiation says
" All charges of war, and all other expenses th it «shall be
incurred for tlie common defense or general welfare, and
illowed by the United States m Congress assembled, shall
be dt fraud out oi a common Ircasurv, which bhalt be sup
plied bj the bevt r il stitt s m jyojoition t i t!i v due ot all
the I md within e ich ^tate giauted ti,or «nrveied for any
person, as such 1 ind, and the binldimrs and unpiovements
thereon, sh ill be < stun ited iccording to <nich m xle is the
T ruled St itt s in Coimrcss assembled shall, from time to
tune direct and appoint
" f he taxes tor paying that proportion shall be laid and
Irvied by the authoriu and direction ot the Legitliture=> of
theseierat Statct, within tlie time agreed upon oy the Urn
ted States m Congress assembled "
This explains the expiession in the deed, " ac-
cording to their usual íespective proportions in
the general charge and expenditure " Each State
was to pay us proportional part of the expenses
of the Government, according to the proportion
mentioned m this article, and the State, not the-
Government, as is now the case, afone had the
light of levying and collecting the taxes necess-u v
to pay her proportion. Now the pait just quoted
from the deed of cession did not mean, and doc %
not say, that the Tedeial Government shiuld
have the power to hold I inds within the limits ot
a State, for the ninth article of the Co*ifetation,
which expiessly says that *' the tenitoiy of no
State shall be taken for the bent fit of the United
States" fot bids it. AH that was meant by it wai,
that the proceeds of the land sold, lying " beyond
the limits of the States," should go into the gen-
eral Treasury, according*' to their usui-lrespeetne
propoitions m the geneial charge and expendi-
ture " Suppose, then, a new State had been ad-
mitted into the Union, during the existence of the
Articles of Confederation, what would have been
the extent of her sovereignty* Exactly that which
was the extent of the sovereignty of one of the
oíd States And how could this have been ascer-
tained ? By a reference alone to the second and
ninth articles of the Confederation The second
article says.
"U ich Stitt retains its sovereignty, freedom and inde-
pendence and every power, jurisdiction, and light, which
is not, hy this Ctmfedci mon, l\i res ! y D£LE6A.TbD to the
tinted States in Congresb a sembted "
And the ninth article says
íl P}0 ule l also, 1 hit no ístatl shall be deprived of ter"
ritoiyjor the benefit of the United Slates "
Can any language be used more direct and
pointed than that found in the two ameles quoted,,
to show that a State coming into the Union under
the Confedeiation, would be equal m all the at-
tributes of sovereignty with the old States, a id
that the tenitoiy ot no State could be taken for
the benefit of the United States ? In othei woids,
that the Fedeial Government had no power to
hold lands within the limits of any of the States
The compact, if it is supposed to conflict with
tin Articles of Confedeiation, could £ivc no now
powci, noi alter m any nnnnir whate\ei tlie
poweis which hid Oicnvfstcd in the Fedeial
Government by the Confedei uion The sivei-
t ienty ol no ¿t ite, theu foic, could have been
limiud, as the Confedeiation did not peimit it,
and tlu deed of ccsbion oi compact lVith Vir-
ginia di 1 not and could not ¿rrant it, and the new
State, had out been admitted, would have come
mt) tlie Confedei icy with "the same nghts: of
ftecd >m, sovereignty, and independence as the
othei Sute-? " it iurthci proof is wanting on
this head, I h tve that at hand which, it seems to
me, is conclusive and irresistible beyond the
powei oi human contiadiction After the adop-
,| tion of the Confi di ration, sever \1 of tht St Ues,
! not satisfied with many of its piovisions, made
objections to joining the Coufedericy, and con-
1 scquently icmained out of it foi some h n^th of
turn Amang these woo Rhode Island anil New
Ji isey, who seemrd to object pnrticulaily to that
t'm&f of the ninth aiticle of the Confederition
which siy$>
" P} oi i led also   1 hat no Slate shall be depnved of ter
nt ny lot the bent, fit ol the United St ites  '
Tht objection of Rhode island, is as follows
£ In the ninth irticte atthe end of the second paragraph,
aflei tlu words fin the bentht ot the United Stages ' add
piovided nevt ittieltss, tli it all land  within these States,
thf propt U\ ol which be! >re the piesent war, was \ested
in the Crovui ot Grt at Umam, or out ot winch quit rents
arise, pa\able to s-ud Crown, shall be deemed, tal en, and
com-i^cred as the pi opcrty of these United States, and be du
posed of and appropriated by Congress for the benefit of the
unole Confederacy, reserving-, houeiei, to the States u-ithin
u/iose limits such Crou.il lands may be, the entire and com
plete jurisdiction thereof * "
| Rejected—ay 1, noes 9 The objection of New
Jersey is m the following language
