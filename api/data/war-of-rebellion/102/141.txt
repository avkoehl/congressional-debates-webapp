HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 20, 1865. (Received 1,40 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

I think representation should be made to Washington of the condition of affairs on southern route. I cannot move against these Indians while Indian agents are negotiating for peace. They have all been guilty of robbery and murder, and now we should punish them. First get the stock stolen and make them give up other U. S. property, then it would be proper to treat for peace. They will make a peace that will keep us quiet until fall, and then they will jump on our last trains and rob them, too late for us to go after them, and I will be blamed for not chastising them before. I am ready to move on them now and desire to do so, regardless of anything the Indian agents are doing. I have no faith in Colonel Leavenworth or any peace he may make, as he is bound, if possible, to protect the Indians. Shall I order General Ford to move?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 20, 1865-4,20 p. m.

General DODGE:

I have sent your dispatch about Colonel Leaven worth and his Indian treaty to General Halleck, at whose suggestion the expedition was halted. Best wait his answer, which will come by telegraph. If we act now it will only be said that we prevented peace, and we will be abused for any hostilities hereafter. Best wait a while. As they stopped the movement from Washington, let them be responsible.

JOHN POPE.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 20, 1865-1,30 p. m.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Please ascertain for what time I must send supplies for the two companies of infantry that are going to mouth of Niobarra to escort pary building wagon road. The general has the letters in case.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
