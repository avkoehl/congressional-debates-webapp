hurt on our side. Rebels coming in and giving bonds. I leave nothing for man or brute in the country passed over by my army, except a little saving to feed the poor, which will hardly save them from suffering. I am sure no rebel army will subsistence in Southern Missouri or Norther Arkansas.

My teams are much dilapidated. Not a horse, mule, or wagon, or set of harness has yet arrived to answer requisition made immediately after the battle of Pea Ridge. I asked for 800 horses, 400 sets of harness (artillery), 1,000 cavalry horses, and fresh and increased transportation. Major Allen promised to help me. Tell him I heard some ox teams crossed the osage some days ago. That is all I can hear of, and they must have been over a month moving to the Osage., If so, they are nearly worn-out, give the major my respects, and beg him to remember me in his prayers. Long marches wear out machinery, and constant supplies must be furnished to fill natural depletions.
