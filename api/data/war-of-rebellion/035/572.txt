A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 31, 1863.

General COLLUM, Chief of Staff:

I have thought it necessary to issue this morning the following General Orders, which I hope will meet with the approval of the commanding general:

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,

Numbers 120. Cincinnati, Ohio, July 31, [1863.]

Whereas the State of Kentucky is invaded by a rebel force, with the avowed intention of overawing the judges of elections, of intimidating the loyal voters, keeping them from the polls, and forcing the election of disloyal candidates at the election on the 3rd of August; and whereas the military power of the Government is the only force that can defeat this attempt, the State of Kentucky, is hereby declared under martial law, and all military officers are commanded to aid the constituted authorities of the State in the support of the laws and the purity of suffrage, as defined in the late proclamation of His excellency Governor Robinson. As it is not the intention of the commanding general to interfere with the proper expression of public opinion, all direction of the conduct of the election will be, as usual, in the hands of the legally appointed judges at the polls, who will be held strictly responsible that no disloyal person be allowed to vote, and to this end the military power is ordered to to give them its utmost support. The civil authority, civil courts and business will not be suspended by this order; it is for the purpose only of protecting, if necessary, the rights of loyal citizens and the freedom of election.

By command of Major-General Burnside, commanding department:
