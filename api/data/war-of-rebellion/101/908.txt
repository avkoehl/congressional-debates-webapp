During the year 1864 the few troops serving within the Department of New Mexico were obliged to undergo extraordinary labors, privations, and hardships in following the line of their duty. Early in the year, while the country was still covered with snow, their marches in pursuit of Navajo Indians, in continuation of the campaign begun in the summer of 1863, the frequent combats with bands of that tribe, not only in the Navajo country, but in the open plains to the east of the Rio Grande, exhibited courage, self-denial, perseverance, ability, and the will to encounter and to endure protracted hardships, on the part of both officers and men, which would be very creditable to any troops in the Army. It was often their lot to be compelled from the nature of the country, and sometimes from limited means of transportation, to carry their blankets and provisions on their backs, and to struggle for days through deep snows, over mountains, through forests, and down through the deep mazes of the most wonderful canons in the world, in pursuit of a wily and active enemy, who was familiar with every road of that distant and in many places hitherto considered inaccessible region. It was their lot to feel that even through they were successful in their efforts far beyond the success which had attended the labors of others who had preceded them in campaigns against these Indians, still they would win none of that eclat which those received for perhaps no harder service on other fields. It was their lot to show fidelity and integrity and earnestness in their labors for the public good, prompted to this course not by the expectation of applause, or advancement, but by a feeling honestly to discharge their duty through no approving eye witnessed their labors or their sufferings, and they had no credit save that shown in the mirror of a clear conscience, or by the approval of their own hearts. The results which followed such labors will be considered as remarkable in the annals of Indian warfare.

The Navajoes soon found they had no place of security from such determined adversaries, and being pressed on every hand by unexampled rigor, the spirit of the tribe was soon broken. Many were captured and more voluntarily surrendered, when in bands of from 50 to 1,000 and 2,000 they commenced their pilgrimage to the Bosque Redondo, a place selected for them by the Government and situated upon the open plains east of the Rio Grande and more than 400 miles from their native valleys and mountains. The exodus of this whole peo and children, with their flocks and herds, leaving forever the land of their fathers, was an interesting, but a touching sight.

Then came the operations of the troops against the Apaches of Arizona. To those acquainted with the difficulties of campaigning in that distant country, formidable against the movement and supply of troops in every way in which a country can be formidable, whether considered on account of its deserts, its rugged and sterile mountains, its frequent and often impassable defiles, and in widely extended regions,
