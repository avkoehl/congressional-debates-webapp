HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 30, 1864-2.20 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The charge by Griffin is one of the boldest I ever saw. His line passed full 600 yards over a clear field defended by infantry against a parapet flanked by an inclosed redoubt. One gun was captured. We lost Colonel Welch, killed on the breast-work of the redoubt. I will push up as fast as I can get my troops in order toward Petersburg on the Squirrel Level road. Parke is extending to the left. I would like to call up all Ayres' command and have his last brigade escort three batteries. Cannot General Bragg establish a picket from the Vaughan road along the road we traveled to Poplar Spring Church. If so, please direct it.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

PEEBLES' FORT, September 30, 1864-3 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The Eighty-third Pennsylvania, General Griffin's division, has taken the redoubt at W. Davis'. Ayres' skirmish line might be forced forward to connect there; then our line would be complete. General Parke is going to push straight for the pike northwest from here, striking near A. Boisseau's. Roebling just tells me our skirmish line now connects with Ayres' skirmish line near the W. Davis [house]. General Bragg need not establish any picket to connect at Poplar Spring Church.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

We have carried enemy's works on the Squirrel Level road, capturing 1 gun, 7 officers, and 52 men. At last accounts our troops were advancing toward Petersburg. Griffin's division charged the works. Colonel Norval E. Welch, commanding Sixteenth Michigan Veteran Volunteers, was killed on parapet of the redoubt.

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The major-general commanding directs that you occupy the intrenchments taken from the enemy to-day, your left holding the redoubt in Peebles' field and your right connecting with your works on the Weldon railroad.
