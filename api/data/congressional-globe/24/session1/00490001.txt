Mr. WHITE sai*, that at the last session ef
the Legislature of the State of Tennessee, he hadl;
been reelected to the Senate of the United States >,
for six years from the 4th of March last, but that
the official information of his election was not in
his possession. It had heretofore been the prac-
tice of the State of Tennessee to transmit to the
r residing officer of the Senate the credentials of
its Senators. But as this had not yet been done,
he submitted to the Chair whether fie should take
his seat. During his attendance in the Senate, he
had frequently known such cases to occur, and
that members known to be elected were suffered
to take their seats befere the arrival of their cre-
dentials. If any additional testimony was nece«-
sary in corroboration of his statement, there were
some oí his colleagues in the other House, who
were present when his election took place, and
could vouch for the fact.
The CHAIR said that if no objection was
made, the gentleman could take his oath with the
other Senators to be qualified.
The usual oath was then administered by the
Vice President to Messrs. White, Hubbard,
King, Clayton, Robinson, and Rccgles, whose
'.redentials were presented at the last session; and
to Messrs. Wall, Knight, and Davis, whose
credentials were just read.
