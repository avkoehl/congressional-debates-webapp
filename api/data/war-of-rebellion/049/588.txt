there that "the ground is low, clayey, and wet - the animals would be over cars in mud and water in a very short time."

This report is confirmed by the commanding officer of my troops there, and I now desire to ask, if possible, that they be allowed to fall back to the high ground in rear of the station, near where the cavalry are encamped.

The pickets can remain to the front, as they now are.
