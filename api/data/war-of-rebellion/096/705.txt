CITY POINT, VA., February 26, 1865-11 a.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

Will please assign Bvt. Brigadier General G. H. McKibbin to duty with his brevet rank. He is very much wanted for the command of a brigade in the Ninth Corps, and cannot command it with his line rank.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, February 26, 1865-9 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Brevet Brigadier-General McKibbin is assigned to duty on his brevet rank. To avoid delays, you are hereby authorized to assign any officer in the service to duty on his brevet rank, notifying the Adjutant-General, so that it may be duly recorded.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, February 26, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I submit the following accompanying inquiry of Governor Fenton for your judgment whether it be expedient to accept such troops for the time and on the terms proposed. Please favor me with an early answer, so that the offer cannot serve to delay the draft.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

[Inclosure.]

ALBANY, N. Y., February 25, 1865.

(Received 11.30 a.m.)

Honorable EDWIN N. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Will you accept five or ten regiments of the State National Guard for 100 days, to do garrison duty in Charleston, Savannah, Wilmington, or other posts, to be applied ratably on the State quota, three men for one one-year man?

R. E. FENTON.

CITY POINT, VA., February 26, 1865-8 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I do not think favorably of Governor Fenton's proposition. The value of 100-days' men is more than absorbed in getting them to where they are wanted and in transferring men relieved by them to where they will be needed, and again in relieving them when their time expires.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
