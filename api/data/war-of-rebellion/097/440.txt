Major General GEORGE L. HARTSUFF,

Bermuda Front:

What have you to attack with? How many men can you lose and still hold your line?

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF BERMUDA HUNDRED, VA., April 1, 1865.

General WEITZEL,Commanding:

If any portion of the enemy's line has been weakened it must be the right. I think we might attack there without endangering our lines if you think it advisable. There is a gun-boat I understand at Broadway Landing which might move up and assist to cover the retreat if we were repulsed. I do not know the strength of the enemy's line there or the position of his guns. I expect soon to get another report from General McKibbin.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

Major General GEORGE L. HARTSUFF,

Bermuda Front:

Please investigate and report if enough troops have left your front to make an attack by you feasible.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

BERMUDA FRONT, April 1, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

General Abbot is now here. He knows the rebel line well, which I do not. He says the flat ground on the enemy's right is perfectly covered by the guns on hills in rear, and that their whole line is exceedingly strong. General Ferrero has sent to capture a picket at any hazards. I will open on them from the artillery in position at 3 o'clock, keep it up for half an hour, and if not replied to will about 4 o'clock advance a skirmish line and try to develop their line, subject to your approval. Please answer immediately.

G. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865.

Major-General HARTSUFF:

I think you had better try your artillery in position on them, and see what it will develop.

G. WEITZEL,Major-General.
