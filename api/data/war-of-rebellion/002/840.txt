HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 14, 1861.

Brigadier General W. GWYNN, Commanding, &amp;c., Norfolk, Va.:

GENERAL: Your telegram of the 14th instant has been received. On the 3rd of May I was gratified at receiving your report, stating your confidence in holding the navy-yard with five thousand troops. I made arrangements to provide you with six thousand, and hoped, by the call for additional volunteers, under the proclamation of the governor of the 3rd instant, that this number would be increased to a larger amount. I have no more available troops at this time to send you, but it is hoped that, with the troops you have and additional volunteers you will receive, you will be able to maintain your position, to accomplish which you must organize your troops and advance their instruction as speedily as possible. There are no tents here for distribution.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 14, 1861.

Colonel T. J. JACKSON, Commanding, &c., Harper's Ferry, Va.:

COLONEL: I am very much concerned at the condition of things and the failure to procure volunteers for the service of the State in the country west of you. One thousand stand of arms and some ammunition will be sent to-morrow, under the charge of troop of cavalry, from Staunton to Beverly, Randolph county, for the use of Colonel Portefield. This troop is to collect together volunteers from the well-affected portions of the country through which it passes. If your condition is such as to allow it, I would like you to send some aid to Colonel Porterfield; but I am unwilling for you to send a man, if by so doing you endanger yourself in the least. Re-enforcements are being sent to you.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 14, 1861.

Lieutenant Colonel E. K. SMITH,

Commanding Confederate States Troops, Lynchburg, Va.:

COLONEL: The commanding general instructs me to to say to you that if there are any regiments of Confederate States troops now under your command in Lynchburg which are ready to take the field, he desires you to send them to this city, where they will find provision already prepared for them by Major W. L. Cabell, of the Quartermaster's Department, C. S. Army. If you have none fit for immediate service, you are instructed to forward them from time to time, by battalions or regiments, under their proper field officers, as soon as you can prepare them for such service, but not to exceed in all three regiments. He requests to be duly notified as after as you send them forward.

I am, &c.,

R. S. GARNETT,

Adjutant-General.
