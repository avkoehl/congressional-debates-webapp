APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[June 9,
Ho. of Reps.

41st Cose....2d Bess.
ing the growth of the country or the prosperity
of the people.
You ask me how I would accomplish this
desirable result? I will tell you. The first
thing I would do would be to restore to the
people (lie currency and the greenbacks which
Secretary McCulloch and Secretary Boutwell
have wrung from them in the last four years.
Tins would increase the producing capacity of
the people nearly a hundredfold. Then the
country would be in the most flourishing con-
dition, and then the people could and would
most willingly contribute $100,000,000 per an-
num for the extinguishment of the public debt.
But now they are not in a condition to do it,
and so long as this narrow, "contracted," and
almost criminal policy is continued, will not be.
So far, Mr. Speaker, I have not discussed
the particular questions presented in the bill
now under consideration ; but I now propose
to devote a little time to an examination of its
features, and perhaps to some of the amend-
ments offered thereto.
I am opposed to this bill; first, because it
proposes to extend, to the extent of $95,000,-
000, our present national banking system. I
iun willing to admit, however, that if we are
lo have banks of issue the national banking
yy^U'in is the best which it is possible to estab-
lish. 1 admit that the issues of the national
banks are well secured. It is not possible that
their hills shall become worthless, for this rea-
son : (hey are secured by a deposit of United
States bonds. My greatest objection to the
national banking system is, the people have to
pay too dearly for the luxury of using its cur-
rency. There is no denying the fact that the
people of the United States pay annually more
than $20,000,000 in gold coin to the national
banks as a bonus for issuing and putling into
circulation $o00,0(KX000ofnati0nal bank notes,
wherrus 1 his $20,000,000 in coin could be
saved to the people by retiring the national
hank notes and issuing in lieu of it $300,000,-
000 of the people's own money—greenbacks 5
and I trust some plan maybe speedily devised
which shall be fairto thenational banks, where-
by the legal tender money may be substituted
for the national bank notes. But X am satis-
lied that no such plan will be adopted by the
present. Congress, for there are too many mem •
tiers both in the House and Senate interested
as stockholders and officers of national batiks
to permit this to be done. I believe the peo-
ple will, sooner or later, take this matter into
their own hands and see to it that stock-
holders and presidents of national banks are
elected to ''slny at home/7 and that men be
elected in their place who have no personal
interest antagonistic to that of the people.
Whwi this shall have been done there will be
no trouble in applying the proper remedy.
Mr. speaker, J hold that the people who sus-
tain the country in peace and in war, who de-
velop its resources and who pay the taxes, are
of light entitled to have the best money which
H is m the power of the national legislature lo
give them. Now, as the legal-tender notes are
admitted to be superior to the national bank
notes, and as they cost the people nothing,-
while $1100.000,000 of national bank notes cost
them $20,000,000 in gold annually, I insist
upouitthat, the people should have legal-tender
notes instead o{ national bank notes. 1 fur-
ther object to the national banking system,
because it is a powerful moneyed monopoly,
and notwithstanding it is represented by some
sixteen hundred banks, it is essentially butono
institution. They all work together as a har-
monious whole. One national bank has no
reason to antagonize another national bmik.
This system has an aggregate capital of over
four hundred million dollars, it is constantly
aggrandizing its wealth and its power. Its
power already for good or for evil is immense,
its power in shaping and controlling the policy
of our Government can hardly be overesti-
mated. Yet its power is constantly being aug-
mented, and if it shall be permitted to coutinue
without interference for the nextfifty or one hun-
dred years its power will be superior to that
of the States, and superior to that of the Gen-
eral Government. It would then be the abso-
lute master not only of the Government but
of the people, and then I fear our republican
Government would exist only in name.
This system has been in existence only a few
years, it has but fairly got under way, and
yet I think I am safe in saying that its profits
in the aggregate already amount to the incred-
ible sum of $250,000,000.
At this rate, Mr. Speaker, how long a time
would be required for the national banks to
absorb not only the national debt, but all the
best paying property of the entire country?
In order that the people may see, to some
extent, what this national banking system is
doing, I call their attention to a statement of
loans and discounts made by national bank
associations in the year 1867, as made to Con-
gress by the Comptroller of the Currency in his
annual report for 18G8. The aggregate amount
of loans and discounts was $3,351,004,GG5 08.
The average time of each loan and discount
was seventy-one days. Now, if we assume the
rate of discount to have been at the rate of ten
per cent, per annum, we will find that their pro-
fits on this branch of their business alone were
about, $05,000,000 for that year. But if we
assume that their rate of discount was at the
rate of eight percent, per annum, we find their
profits were about $55,000,000, which is per-
haps nearer the true amount than $05,000,000.
As regards the loans and discounts of the banks
for the year 1868, I am unable to submit the
facts, for the reason that the Comptroller of
the Currency has omitted from his annual re-
port for 1869 this valuable information; at leastj
I have been unable to find it there.
But this is not all. I offered a resolution,
which was adopted by the House on my motion,
early in the present session, and which I will
read for the information of the House. It is
as follows:
"Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury bo
directed to furnish this House with the information
required to be obtained by the Comptroller of the
Currency, as required by section two of the act of
March 1869, entitled 'An act regulating tho reports
of national banking associations.'"
The section here referred to I will also read.
It is as follows :
"And be it further enacted, That in addition to said
reports each national banking association shall re-
port to the Comptroller of the Currency tlie amount
of each dividend declared by said association, and
the amount of net earnings in excess of said divi-
dends, which report shall be mado within ten days
after the declaration of each dividend, and attested
by the oath of the president or cashier of said asso-
ciation, and a failure to comply with the provisions
of this scction shall subject-&ueh association to the
penalties provided in the foregoing section."
In answer to this resolution the Comptroller
of the Currency subsequently submitted a
r'eport to the House, from which I have extract-
ed the following table, which shows tho divi-
dends, capital, and earnings in exccss of divi-
dends, and per cent, of profits for the past
year; which I now send to the Clerk's desk to
be read.
The Clerk read as follows:
