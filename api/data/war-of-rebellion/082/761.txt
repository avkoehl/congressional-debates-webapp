enemy as long as possible in check, remembering that time with us is everything. Captain Beazley is ordered to Jacksonville to re-enforce you.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. S. FAIRLY,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

RICHMOND, VA., July 10, 1864.

Colonel J. TAYLOR, WOOD,

Wilmington, N. C.:

Telegram of yesterday received. The object and destination of the expedition have somehow become so generally known that I fear your operations will meet unexpected obstacles. General R. E. Lee has communicated with you and left your action to your discretion. I suggest calm consideration and full comparison of views with General G. W. C. Lee, and others with whom you may choose to advise.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., July 10, 1864-6.15 p.m.

General G. W. C. LEE,

[Care of General Whiting],

Wilmington, N. C.:

Sent telegram this morning to Colonel John T. Wood to indicate my belief that the attempt would now be fruitless. If you have not other information I advise abandonment of project.

JEFF'N DAVIS.
