works on the French Revolution, and in his
celebrated "Appeal from the new to the old
Whigs," he laid down and enforced the princi-
ple, that men, told by the head, are not, in a
political sense, the people of a country, but that
firtures, corpoi ations, orders, and classes, being dis-
i net parís of the general mass., and founded upon
prerogative, privilege, perpetwty, and propaty, that
these, taken together, constitute "the people," or the
nation Thus, in his creed, the natural man, the
individual citizen, is annihilated as a constituent
element of the nation or the people, and the artifi-
cial combination substituted in hi« place—a princi-
ple, the exact opposite of that upon which this
Government, with its freedom, stands And yet,
sir, it is upon this principle of Mr Burke that the
discrimination is here sought to be made between
the Government and the people It is here, in the
Senate, that the same combinations, oiders, banks,
and ooi porations, resting upon the sa lie separate
interests, the same privileges and immunities, stand
forth claiming to be "the people" of this country,
andasseitmg a right to its Government. We can
now understand what is meant «hen gentlemen oí
Mr Burke's school speak ol "the people " We
may know that corporations, that banks, not lneh-
1 iduaN, are   intended, we   may   Know  that  this
inciple, for proel inning which Mr Buikc was
publicly expelled (rom lit libcial patty ol fnglanl,

But to the substitute What ire us features,
what its principles1 Ihcy aie few, and In no means
novel It prososes no project yet to be tested by
experiment, but one which experiment has already
shown to be impracticable It proposes the tormor
State bank deposite system, in lull view oi the
ruins, of that system Banl notes are again to be
received, to be received as equivalent to montv,
though the very discrimination which constitutes
the essence of the substitute, implies that they are
not so equivalent The public treasure is to be
placed, for safety, in banks expressly authorized to
render it unsafe, by applying it to their own use, as
they have dono millions still withheld from I lit
Government Such are the favors proposrd as
bounties to the banks for the resumption of specie
payments—for complying with their obligations—
lor pajing their debts—for ceasing to loist the 1 iw
such is the rewaid to be offered by G< veinment to
bribe rebellion bae1 nloobedience Andnow,su,
I ask, in what will the resumption ot specie pay-
ments under the provisions ol this substitute, bene-
fit the Government, when, by the substitute itself,
the Government solemnly contracts with tin banks
not to demand specie, but to recen e, exclusively,
the íery notes it now rejects1 The Government
now lefuses to receive them for no other reason
than because the banks now refuse to pay them—
and yet, the Government is required to receive
them, in future, under an express stipulation
that they are not to be paid For if Government
is compelled, by law, to receive notes, good faith,
in the execution of the law forbids their presenta-
tion for pa} men t And thus, instead oí inducing
resumption, this measure proposes, m effect, to le-
galize and perpetuate suspension, so far ?s Govern-
ment is concerned, and to the full extent of its re-
venue- That such will be the effect, docs any
man doubt? Then test the question 1} extending
the principle Suppese the ivhole community
should make the like contract with the banks,
should agree that, for an indefinite series of years,
their bills should be received as money, and thus
incur the obligation, in good faith, not to present
them for redemption In such a case, would the
banks keep a silver dollar on hand' Would they
have use for one? And would not the su>pcnsi n
be universal and eiernal—and that, too, undei the
plighted faith of the public1 What, sir, is the lan-
guage c f the substitute1 It says to the Government-
rake the notes of banks, do not present them for
payment, express this your confidence m them,
the people will follow your example, they
will do the same, no specie will then be
drawn, the banks can then resume, we shall then
have a currency mixed of paper and of metí!,
and all will go well But, sir, what resumption1

metal to come which is to enter into the circula-
tion?" How are these thing to be done, if both
Government and people are to receive nothing but
notes, and never to ask their redemption? No, sir,
the only security for the banks themselves, and for the
community against bank excesses and impositions,
consists m leaving every one, Government and all,
free to receive, to reject, or to piesent their noles
at pleasure for payment This being the fact,
there will always exist a modified confidence in the
solvency of banks that are solvent, which, whilst
it is sufficient to sustain then circ ulation, will yet
beso distrustful as to excite in them the apprehension
of a run upon the appearance of any indiscretion
on their part, and thus impose .ill the safeguards of
which such institutions admit To absolute and
unqualified confidence, they are not entitled Hu-
man etpeuenee foibids such confidence tobe be-
stowed on any man, or combination of men, whose
agency is to affect the well being of others Go
vernment itself, the responsibility of all public
functionaries, rests upon a degree of distrust m the
public mind, ¡sufficient to excite vigilance, and to
detect delinquency
Again, sn, what is the substitute but a covenant
with the banks, by vvInch the Government is to
give them a credit, indefinite asto time,and limned
in amount onlj by the tot il of its income1 And
llns ciedit is to be given to lh< i nlv speuesof
dt bio's whose lespoasibihty is alwn}s uncertain,
whose stounty is never suílicimt and against
vv bom it is impossible, in the naluie of things, ever
tu en torce the laws of the eounliy for is it not
manifest, fiom all past and piesent experience, that
the e institutions have become so connected with the
vv hole machinery ol society, so interwoven with the
very texture ot our social economy, as to defy the
enforcement ol legal obligations, and to compel their
ereditors,Governnient, and people, tn tempori/e with
and to coax them into compli mee with those ohliga-
tn us? Why was the extra session ol Congress railed1
Wis it because the Gove rnment had no money?
No, but because (he hanks had the monev ol the
Government, and lefused to p iy it Was the
Government thus aircstcd in its action, and com-
pelled to resuscitate itself by a forced loan from
the people1—was this the case, because it had no
levemie, and because ihne existed no specie m the
eoimtiy ' No, but because Iht banks liad posses-
sion of its revenues, and because their vaults with-
held the specie from all then creditors And yet,
when, where, and by whom weie the laws oMhe
land enforced against fhem ' Whe n did the Go-
vernment, in a single instance, obtain judgment
and enforce execution? Who, of all the citi/ens,
resorted to that law against tha binks, which the
banks were daily enforcing against them, and
which they, the people, weie daily culorcing against
each other1 No, sir, not at all, but, on theocn-
trary, this universal rebellion of the banks against
all law has been legalised and extended by the
law mal ing power Thus it i", that the Govern-
ment is leqinreel to ban to the banks the whole
revenue of the country jncl, in effect, to double
this loan, by leceiving their notes, m the first
instance as money lti to such debtors that the
Government is required to make sue h a loan,
whilst it refuses to credit an honest citizen, with
his homeless family, for one sobtaiy acre of its
public domain
Thus briefly, sir, have I sought to illustrate the
principles anil tendency of this substitute It is a
measure rendeied equally edious by the circum-
stance  under which it is presented, by the assump-
tion on which it rests, and by the consequences
which must inevitably result from its adoption It
comes to us in the feum of a demand—a demand
made as a political light—made by private corp i-
rations upon this Government and people, for the
use of the pjblic money , and for a moitgage upon
the future revenues of the country It demands
also, that, m addmon to this, the Government and
the peopk shall give to these coipoiatious a credit
indefinite as to time and amount, and that, too,
without an equivalent, without adequate secu-
rity, and without any necessity for so don g
This demand of objects so important is made
at a time when ihese corporations, having
prostrated the laws of the country—having seized

Senate,
the pubbc treasure~- havmg refused to pay their
notes m the hands of the people—are now standing
out in fearless defiance of all public authority. And
what right have the banks to make this demand?
Have they a better cjaim to the public money than
an equal number of other individuals who are not
incorporated? No, none whatever. What, then,
should we think, what should we feel, if, instead of
a league of eight bundled banks, eight hundred citi-
zens should band themselves together m battalion
form, should surround this Capitol, and, instead of
agents,attorneys, borrowers, and dependants, should
send their mi'itary commander into this chamber,
to demand, on theirjbehalf, the whole national in-
come? Would not every Senator then spring to
his feet, fiied with the rage of insulted honor?
Would he not meet such a demand with the deep-
est execi ations, and would not the whole body of
the American people rush to the Capítol to rescue
their treasure from pillage, and their Government
from usurpation1 Yes and what, sir, is the dif-
feienee between the two cases? There is none, no
circumstance ol discrimination, except the popular
delusion which tiansforms the banks from private
corporations into political institutions, and invests
these associations of mere brokers and shavers with
all the authority, the attributes, and the dignity, oí
oigamzed po'itical departments It is this delusion,
ausing lrotn the unrebuked assumptions of the
banks, and strengthened by the silent acquiescence
of time, that Ins enabled these incorporated compa-
nies thus to ohange their character m the public
estimation
But, sir, I must again press upon the attention ol
the Senate the startling fact that this demand of the
public money is made by the banks, upon the
avowed assumption that the Constitution has pro-
vuled no sufficient means lor the execution of its
own povv eis, that the officers elected under it by the
people are not to be trusted, and that the irrespon-
sible agencies of banks, unknown to the. Constitu-
tion, must be brought in to supersede those officers,
to supplant the Constitution itself, and to take
charge of a Government -which the people are sup-
posed incompetent to administer Thus we, the
representatives of the States and of the people, are
insulted to our very faces, foi, if the numerous citi-
zens selected to perform the duties of the other de-
partments of Government be unworthy of the puh-
lie confidence, how shall we escape the same de-
nunciation, or assume to be more worthy than
they1 But even this outrage, great as it is, might
be endured, if it were confined to us, and to the
officers of Government alone Such, however, is
not the fact, for this demand, thus made upon the
grounel that agents selected by the popular voice?
are unworthy of confidence, is equally an insult to
the majesty of the sovereign people themselves. It
rs a declaration to them that they are incompetent
to elect, and that therefore, the elective franchise,
so prostituted and abused, is to be withdrawn from
them, and confeirecl upon the banks
And now, Mr President, what are the imme-
diate consequences which are to result from the
adoption of the substitute1 The banks of deposite
arc to be selected by the joint -v ole of the two
Houses of Congress Heie, then, the banks and
the Government are to be united, not only in the
exterior administration of the finance^, but that
union is to begin m the very source ol the law
making power The banks aie to enter the Capi-
tol, with their fatal facilities, to canvass against
each other, with the members of Congress, for the
custody of the national revenue They are here >o
canvass for these favors wilh the very men by
whose votes this íevenue is to be laised, reduced,
oi diminished, and, consequently, the profits of the
successful b nits auamented or lessened What a
scene would this present1 Eight hundied mo-
neyed corporations, with five hundred millions
of dollars to loan, garrisoned each w.nter in the
Capitol, among their faithful presidents, law-
yers., stockholders, and borrowers, canvassing for
a majority of the two Houses—canvassing for
the deportes., for an increase of taxes, and for
a diminution m the expenditure of those taxes
when collected' In such a scene, what would
become of legislative purity? what of the rights of
the people?   What of the public liberty?   And.
