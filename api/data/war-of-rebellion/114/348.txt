Answer. Yes, sir; he did join the army of Price. He carried a company of men with him raised in Pettis County and joined the army near Fort Scott, near Dry Wood. He entered my regiment. This was in August as well as I recollect.

Question. Do you know about when it was that the accused was taken at Georgetown? State how long before or after the capture was it that Captain E. H. Magoffin joined the army with his force raised in Pettis County.

Answer. I do not know the precise date. It was as well as I recollect near the 1st of August. It was some time about the middle part of August that the captain joined me. The capture of the father was before the joining of the son, as the latter told me of it on his way out.

Question. Did any other company from Pettis County join the army about that time?

Answer. Yes, sir; a company under Captain Staples; one under Captain McCarey.

Answer. I was a captain in the army.

Answer. I was, sir.

Question. State whether in communications passing from officer to officer in the army of Price the accused was or not reported to be engaged in that service?
