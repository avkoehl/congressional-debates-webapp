Mr. WILLIAMS. I would ask the Senator
from Maine if these changes indicate an ad-
vance in salaries?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. They do not.
They indicate simply that we are making the
bill conform to the estimates. They provide
for the service in conformity with the annual
estimates submitted from the Treasury Depart-
ment. I will say that the proper agents of the
Treasury were before the committee and satis-
fied the committee that the amendments ought
to be made in conformity with the estimates.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I understand, then, that
the bill as it passed the House of Representa-
tives was below the estimates made by the
Treasury Department?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Yes, sir.
Mr. WILLIAMS. And these amendments
are simply putting the bill according to the
estimates?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Yes, sir.
Mr. POMEROY. I have no doubt this is
right, but I do not understand it. I see in
this paragraph one of the amendments, " two
clerks, $3,300." There is no class in which
two clerks can draw $3,300.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. What does the
Senator refer to ?
Mr. POMEROY. Line six hundred and
fifteen. I presume it is right, but I do not
understand it. It says, "two clerks, $3,300."
There is no class in which two clerks can draw
that sum.
Mr. COLE. It is in New Orleans.
Mr. POMEROY. I know it is in New
Orleans; but the clerks are classified.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. This is in the
office of the Assistant Treasurer, and the clerks
there are not classified. They range all the
way from $1,000 to $2,000. They are not
classified.
Mr. POMEROY. Perhaps that will account
for it. I supposed they were classified; I had
been so informed.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. They are not.
There are some clerks no higher than $1,000.
Mr. POMEROY. It may be all right.
Mr. COLE. Their salaries are fixed bylaw.
Mr. KELLOGG. I have just returned to
the Chamber, and I am informed thatthe clause
relating to the Assistant Treasurer at New
Orleans has been acted upon. . I desire to
inquire what action, if any, has been taken
upon the amendments?
