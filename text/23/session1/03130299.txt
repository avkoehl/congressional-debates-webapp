Leen enough for him to say, tna' there was a ores-

he " found the office in a state cf confus on "
Mr L   suggested that the time of some of the

of the Government     The levenue of the coun ry
was likely to prove inadequate to its wants     The
Post Office Department was in debt, and its debts
must be paid, in what manner, he left it to the
advocates of strict construction to say    He would
call ¡he a'ten ion of the House to some facts which I
wo ild show that the present was not a time to in-  I
cease the buidensof the people   In a letter which
he haa before him, from t town in Ohio, wheat

large quan' ty of meat and gram from the Wed,
and of cotton  from the South     Sixteen of the
cot*on mills which created the demtnd for this
supply, had aheady stopped, and others were
about to stop
Mr L would be obliged (he said) to vote for
the proposition indicated yesteiday by the gentle
nan fiom Ohio [Mi Vance] for the reduction of
all salaries of civ il officers His duty to the peo-
ple would requiie him—though the calamity was
une \pected— to vote for the reduction of his own
piy as a met ioei of the House lie feaied that
he snould be obliged to suggest anothei amend
merit to this bill A committee wa-, to go forth to
ascertain wheie our money is He hoped they
would find, m the course of their investigation,
that the Bmk of the United States was still a safe
and proper depository of the public funds, and
that they would sore nrt to the House He should,
therefore, beg thechauman of the Committee of
"Ways i nd Means *o consent to an amendment to
the bid, by adding tne words "deposited in the
United «tue-, Bmk, 'after the words " to be paid
out of any money in the Tietsury not otherwise
appropriated " If thet u k, aftera fair investiga-
te, sh n'd be fou idti unworthy, the House will
certau ly n„-et thit it is a proper depository for
the j ubhe money He should not move this
Bvuni'mci t with a view to delay the result of the
mveeti'ilion     Ik hoped the bank was prepared i
to mee' it, and that it would result satisfactorily
In tilt n.ean t n,e, he thought tne appropnations
which are mice ou^ht to be sUl ject to the same
disposition as heretofore He wuuld not go into
the question now Befóte the subject was uiii
matelydispo ed of, he should take an oppoiiumty
to offti his views at large in legard to it
Mr llAWEa v/as son y (ne su d) that the gen-
t'enian from Massacl uaetis hau taken this occa-
sion to launch out in opposition to the measures of
tne Government lie amp tted triat the gentlerr an
had been in a situation where he should have'earned
something of tne foims of ousi isss.and this was
the only tiling in thegeiitlcmau 's remarks in which
he concurred The sum of his wnole aigunient
was, nut that the appropuation la unrecessaiy,
but thit the Secretary of State, in asking foi it,
cast asiui on foimei Secretar es Mr II pointed
to instances in whiJi extia cleiks weie piuuded
for in the S ate Dcpaitment, in the appruormtiuu
bi'l, wmle that department was undei the direction
o'theveryge tinman [Mr Abíiis] who made the
motion to s n1 e out i i s appro, rntion But tie
gentleman had faveded out oí his argumei t n
o. der to attack the Postmastei General II" hoped
üiat gent'emen would not make f>is attack here,
"vvi boat they weie prepared tosus'am it If there
was a Jcfitu in the Post Office Department, the
Postmas er General was rot liable fcr it It was
owing entirely to gentlemen r n ihis floor and m
tne Senate. Ihe very membeis woo abuse the
Pobtmaster General here are found every day
cm gingto hii., and begging additional mailfacil
ltics for then res, cctive neighbornoods The
accommodations which have bee extended to the
country by the Post Office Dennrtmem, for i few
yeais past, far exceeded those of foimei yea s
He wou'd repeat, that not the Postma e General,
but the repre entft ves of the peo.ile, weie to be
blaned for the mciease of the expendituie of the
department The gent'^man ■sua f-at he would
vote for the "eduction of the com^e^sat on of the
members of Congress 1 hope (slid Mr H ) tl at
I shall alwajs be read/ tu vote foi ary s>ahitaiy
i eduction But v. lien the gentleman comes out in
advance, and says that he will vote a reduction
which is not under consideration, he induces us to
suppose that he wou'd not make the declaration,
if ha thought the measure would pass
lie should not have made these remarks if the
gentleman had not gone out of his way to at'ack
the Postmaster General Tne time would come
when the people of this country would feel grate-
ful to Mr Barry for tne nbeial and intelligent
manner in wl ich he had administered the affairs of
the Post Office
Mr  LINCOLN lose to explain that he had not
al'uded, in any mannei, 'o  the Postmastei Gen
eial   lie spoke only of the debts of the depai tment,
wi hout say rg whether this House or the Post-
mastei Gep rpl nad involved it in debt
Mr WARD said that he rose for the purpose of
submittn g a single remark on the sublet under
consideration, witr the view of making the hon-
orable gentleman from Massachusetts acquainted
with the fact that the subject in relatio" to arrang-
ing and making indexes to-the aidmts m the De-
partment of State, was submitted to the House of
Repiesentatives, in the first nstance, by Mi Liv
mgston, tne late Secietary of State, in compliance
with a call made upon him by tnis Hou«e, pnd not
by the piesent Secietary of State, as that honor
able gentleman sunposes
Mr W said that a resolution was introduced
into this House some two or three years ago, ac-
cording to the best of his recollection—he did not
remember the precise date íequirmg the Commit-
tee of Wavs and Means to inquire into the expe-
diency of such a measure That the committee
thereupon addressed letteis to the heads of depart-
ments, requesting their opinions uoon the subject
In answer theieto, they gave it as then deliber-
ate opinion that such a measure was absolutely
necessary At that time the si m of j,6,000 Mas
inserted in the appiopriation bill, to be applied to
that object, which, as was stated yesterday by the
honorable gentleman from Missachusetts, [Mr
Fvi-rett.] was lost m the Senate by reason of
one of the membeis of the committee to whom the
suljecthad been íefeired, having moved to strike
it out, under theimpiession that the same item of
appropriation vvas t*ice inserted m the same bill
He said he had no doubt but that the Secretary of
State was induced, from that circumstance, to ask
foi the appropnation at this time, and he consid-
ered that the honorable gentleman from Massa-
cnusetts [Mi Lincoln] had done great injustice
to theSeuetiry of biate, by observing that he had
cast a ¡tflection upon his piedecessoisin office, in
his letter to the Committee of Ways and Means,
which had been read That letter does not cast
the slightest reproach upon any of the gentlemen
who i ave heretofore filled that high office,and the
distinguished gentleman now at ihe head of the
Department of State is incapable of making such
a charge against any individual.
The attention of the late Secretary of State was
drawn to this subject more particularly in conse-
quence or me act ol the Oth of May, 1833, which
auihonzed t e publication of ihe diplomatic cor-
ies¡ ondtnee from 17feá to 17o9, and which, by a
lecent íesoluuon of this House, is dnected to be
distiibuted The voluminous papers from which
tl e selections were made had been deposited in
thegariet rooms of the Depaitment of State, m
fi es once ananged and labelled, but from acci-
dents and removals, the researches of Instopans,
and the mistakes oi neglect of those who from
time to time had access to the papers, in restoring
t íem to the proper files, a peifect scene of confu-
sion existed, and no man living cou d tell what
papers weie in the garret rooms oi what were
missing They were theiefoie obliged to op n
eveiy bundle of papers, with little regard to their
labels, and fiom the vast mass to se'ect everything
wl ich, boie upon the diplomacy of the country for
that period
During the progress of this work i n act of Con-
gress was passed authorizing the publication of the
Documental y History cf the Um ed States, which
will embrace a large proportion of the revolution-
ary papers 1 hese must be selected and prepared
for tne pi ess A contract has been made with
Messis Clarke and Force by the late Secretary of
Suite to edit and puL'isn the woik, and unless the
proper documen's, most of which are now in the
Department of State, are arranged or put in some
order, the work cannot progiess with the íequired
facility, and the papers, old and worn as they now
are, will sustain great damage without the contem-
plated arrangement and binding up in volumes
Among these papéis, transcripts of which are now
required for the Documentary History, are com-
prised not only the letters of theofficers and agents
of tne government, civil and military, but a mass
of other papers ot infinite importance to the finances
cf the country The i epoT ts of all the various com
miltees of Congicss from 1775 to 1789 on public
afTans, and upon the applications of individuals, of
which tkei e is voi ecoi d, and excepting a few printed
i epoi ts, nothing exists but the original drafts of the
reports oí those committees Of the same charac-
ter ai e the let'ers and reports of the Board of War,
letters and reports of the Boaid of Treasury and of
the Superintendent of Finance, wherein a multi-
plicity of claims growing out of the revolutionary
contest were reported or decided upon, and some
of which are kept alive to thepreBentday There
is no reco-d, nor are tnere duplicates of those pa-
péis By arranging these papers, and binding them
in vo'umes, with suitable indexes, they will be pre-
seived to futtue generations Several volumes
have been so arranged, but if the remainder are
left as they now aie, a few years more must en-
sure their decay and entire loss
The honoraole gentleman fiom Massachusetts
[Mr Lincoln] seems to think, that our finances
ate not in a situation to wariant this expenditure.
This objection, a few years ago, might have been
urged with some foice, when we were indebted a
hundred millions of dollars, but the expenditure
of the small sum of 1,400 dollars, now that the
debt is extinguished, for an object so laudable,
and which all admit to be necessary, can carry
but little weight with it
The objection against its being inserted in the
appropriation bill might have been mged with
greatei plausibility, if this had been the first time
I appropriations had been made in this manner, but
as similar provisions have been inserted in most
of tne appiopriabon bills heretofore passed, Mr
W said he should therefore record his vote in
favor of it
I     He said he would take this occasion to observe,
