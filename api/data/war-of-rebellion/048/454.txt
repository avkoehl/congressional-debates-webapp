The foregoing list embraces officers and men. A liberal addition may be allowed for prisoners captured by men and turned over to infantry guards and not credited to the cavalry. One negro escaped from the guard while getting on the cars at Culpeper Court-House. The fact was reported at the time.

One hundred and seven long-range guns turned over at Madison Court-House to provost-marshal, 96 turned over at James City, 42 at Culpeper Court-House. Another lot (number not known) was collected near Culpeper Court-House and sent to depot. Nine horses turned over to me were turned over to horse artillery.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, general, your most obedient servant,

G. M. RYALS,

Major, and Provost-Marshal.

[P. S.]-This report includes only the prisoners that were reported to the provost-marshal. It is believed, however, that the number captured by the cavalry will reach 1,600 when we include those turned over to the infantry and others sent back without coming to the provost-marshal.
