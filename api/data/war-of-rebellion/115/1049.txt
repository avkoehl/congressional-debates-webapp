In reply I have the honor to acquaint you that Mr. Maury was arrested for conveying information contrary to the military regulations of the United States. His case is undergoing examination and your request for his discharge cannot be complied with until the result shall show that there is no sufficient cause for his further detention.

In compliance with your request orders have been given to Colonel Martin Burke, commanding at Fort Hamilton, to allow any member of the Briths legation to visit Mr. Maury at Fort Lafayette.
