heights about us. I have ordered the infantry and artillery back, and directed the company of cavalry to ascertain the facts about the laying of the bridge. I have little doubt but they are doing it.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUDON, November 14, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

A courier in from Huff's Ferry states that the enemy have crossed as much as a regiment in boats, and are laying a bridge. He asserts that the himself heard them laying planks. Our pickets have fallen back over a mile. The officer I sent in command of the cavalry will ascertain the truth, but it will be an hour or two before I shall have it.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUDON, November 14, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

A man from Huff's Ferry again reports the enemy building the bridge. If they are to be attacked before crossing, or during the crossing, I ought to move my whole command at once, and be supported by the Ninth Corps. If we are not to fight, I ought to know it immediately, before daylight discloses our situation.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUDON, November 14, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

My adjutant-general has just returned from Huff's Ferry. He reports the bridge substantially completed. I have all my transportation between here and Lenoir's. I presume the enemy's advance will be pushed forward at once. Their cavalry advance call was distinguished.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUDON,[November 14, 1863.]

General BURNSIDE:

Our infantry pickets are engaging the enemy, who are advancing within 1 1/2 miles of this place. My command is moving on toward Lenoir's according to your orders of this morning, and if nothing further to communicate, I will now close office at this place.

JULIUS WHITE.
