WASHINGTON, D. C., August 1, 1862.

General POPE, Warrenton, Va.:

General Burnside's command has been ordered to Fredericksburg. As soon aa they arrive, use King's division as you deem best. Watch the Shenandoah Valley. It is believed that the enemy are preparing to operate there. If so, attack them in flank and give no rest.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
