HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Glasgow, Mo., September 27, 1864.

General DOUGLASS,In the Field, near Fayette:

GENERAL: Anderson and his friends captured the train from Saint Louis to-day at Centralia Station, killed 21 soldiers who were

on the train, robbed the passengers, and burned the cars. I hear that Major Johnson's force from Paris had a fight with them soon after and were repulsed. The concentration is evidently in that direction. Lose no time in getting your forces after them. They will probably come into Boone or Howard.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

He says the guerrillas are concentrating in great numbers, nearly 600 strong. Move with promptness and strike with determination.
