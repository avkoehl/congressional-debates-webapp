HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 8, 1862

Major-General THOMAS, Gallatin:

In telegraphing you just now that Granger's whole force was needed at Mitchellsville, I should have said at Bowling Green. If, therefore, Rousseau's brigade, at Mitchellsville, is moved by you, you will have to supply their place. The general is not in, and I state this simply to correct my mistake. Perhaps you have some understanding with him about this.

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, December 8, 1862

General THOMAS:

Is there any danger to Hall's brigade? If so, you must take the most prompt measures to succor it.

ROSECRANS.

GALLATIN, December 8, 1862

General ROSECRANS:

A refugee from beyond Lebanon this morning reports that Kirby Smith left Murfreesborough for Lebanon this morning with a pretty large force. Have not heard from Hall yet. Have sent two dispatches to him.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

[DECEMBER 8, 1862]

General THOMAS:

Have you any doubts about the dispatch reaching Hall, or his using due diligence in obeying the order? Do you hear anything of Polk? Did that refugee see or hear of Kirby Smith's operations?

ROSECRANS.

[DECEMBER 8, 1862.]

General ROSECRANS:

I should suppose Hall would obey my orders, being sent as they were, written and explicit what to do. I cannot be positive, but think there is but little doubt but the messengers will reach Hall. The refugee said nothing about Polk, and did not see Kirby Smith moving.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-Generals, U. S. Volunteers.

[DECEMBER 8, 1862]

General ROSECRANS:

I cannot hear of any of the enemy being on this side of the river Have directed Colonel Harlan too meet Hall on the road at Hartsville, and then to come here. Dispatch was forwarded to Colonel Hall last night to come to Hartsville.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
