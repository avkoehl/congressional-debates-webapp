and destruction to wagons if loaded to haul over them. I expected to break mine to pieces, but fortunately got along with a few breakages by dint of much care and manual assistance at the wheels, and with guy ropes to keep from upsetting.

I have freely talked with Governor Goodwin, Mr. McCormick, and with many others about this locality. The Governor does not think it the place for a military post, except temporarily, with regard to the point where the first Legislature will assemble.

* * * * * * *

My idea, general, is to move at the proper time this post of one infantry company and portion of a cavalry company to the point where the Legislature will probably meet, and to which there is a good road; the balance move south, and with other companies, as I have recommended, establish the post along the Salinas or in that vicinity; that is the heart of the Apache Nation. Something must be done quickly or prospectively we shall have a big Indian war on our hands, and most of the white people now in this Territory will either be driven from it or killed by the Indians. Much of the stock in the mines has been killed or stolen, and farmers and miners are leaving, some for want of supplies and others from panic, but generally there is a desire to turn out and put down the Indians.

Governor Goodwin says something will have to be done or he fears we shall have to give up the country. The mines are so numerous and reported so rich, and the richest of specimens I have seen from them, that I begin to think there is gold, silver, and copper enough in Arizona for all who wish to dig it out. I expect the subsistence stores have been sent to Yuma, from information received from Colonel Coult since here; have directed him to send Ochoa's train for a load when it returns from Sonora. I hope to find instructions from you, on my return to Tucson, about supplies. There is a plenty of fresh meat here for the present. For this reason I thought it best to not hurry Captain Pishon back, and first hear from you. I may, on returning to Tucson, take a force and examine the country east of the San Francisco River, along the Salinas and Gila, toward the Prieto.

* * * * * * *

Colonel Poston is cross as a bear, and terribly down on me and others. The Governor said he thought I had taken a prudent course and that the agreement with Allen was valid. The Government was authorized to act as it had. P[oston] is sore because he could not have public transportation and escorts to promote his personal interests and popularity [as a] candidate for Congress, I am told; so is Dr. Leib strong. Ten p. m. and raining. I fear an unpleasant trip back. Please give my kind regards to my friends. Dr. McNulty left yesterday. Colonel Chaves makes a short exploration, and then will start with his entire force.

* * * * * * *

With kind regards, I remain, general, very truly, yours,

N. H. DAVIS.

PRIVATE.] TUCSON, April 5, 1864.

DEAR GENERAL: I have so much I wish to say that I am at a loss what to say and where to begin. My official papers will generally post you with regard to my acts.
