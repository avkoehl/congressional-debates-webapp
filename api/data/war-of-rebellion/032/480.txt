Before I left Devall's Bluff, he wrote me that I was under command of General Schofield, whom I had regarded as my junior. I immediately wrote to Schofield on this subject, and informed him that I had received no orders placing me under his command, and that General Grant had directed me to report to Hurlbut. Subsequently, I received orders from Hurlbut to report to Schofield. My report of the operations of the campaign which terminated with the capture of Little Rock, was addressed to Schofield. I sen you a dispatch immediately on entering the city.

After we had occupied the place for nine days, I received a letter from Schofield proposing a plan for the campaign. This was the first advice I had received from him on the subject. It was announced in the newspapers that he had gone to Kansas, and it was therefore evident that he could not communicate with me for some time to come. I thought it important you should be informed immediately in regard to the status of affairs in Arkansas, and some things were required here at once. I have, therefore, addressed several communications to General Hurlbut, who is in telegraphic communication with you, and within supporting distance of me. In fact, I have kept him constantly advised in regard yo my movements and the wants of my command, and he has manifested a disposition to render every assistance in his power. I am also greatly to General [J. W.] Davidson for the energy, perseverance, intelligence, and gallantry with which he has executed my orders. Colonel F. H. Manter, Thirty-second Missouri Infantry, also deserves especial mention as acting chief my staff. The enemy's defenses, covering the city on the north bank of the river, were very formidable. I will send a drawing delineating them.* Price seems not to have considered the possibility of our crossing the Arkansas and getting in his rear until our arrangements for the movement were completed, or nearly so. On being informed that his flank was turned, he replied that the Yankees were not going to entrap him like they did Pemberton, and immediately gave the order to retreat. Fagan's and Tappan's brigades and Marmaduke's cavalry division were sent to hold us in check until they could get their train well on the road. This is the force Davidson's cavalry division encountered on Fourche Bayou, and which our artillery played upon from the other side of the river. A clerk at Price's headquarters informs me that the rebel force amounted to over 20,000 on paper, and that they had about 12, 000 fit for duty on the 10th instant, the day we entered the city. This clerk was a tutor in the family of Mr. Bertrand, the first man in this place, and a Crittenden Union man; and I regard his statement as perfectly reliable. The pontoon bridges were broken and burning, and I could not get the infantry across the river in time to pursue the retreating rebels. The pursuit by the cavalry, under Merrill, on the 11th, I regret to say, was not as vigorous as I expected it would be. If I could have followed Price with my whole force, I have no doubt but that his army could have been dispersed in two days. As it was, his troops were greatly demoralized, and deserted almost by regiments. It is represented to me by citizens that they are scattered over the country in every direction. Many have come in and voluntarily taken the oath of allegiance, and gone to their homes. Some have enlisted in our service and others have joined companies of Union men who have banded together for self-protection. Organizations of this sort are daily presenting themselves at my headquarters and beg-
