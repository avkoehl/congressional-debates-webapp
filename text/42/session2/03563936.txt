or owners thereof, or of any interest, easement,
or right of occupancy theiein, to appropriate
such property or interest, easement, or right

States in the manner hereinafter provided.
The second section provides that the Secre-
tary of the Treasury shall make and officially
subsetibe as many certificates in all respects
alike as may be necessaiy, stating: first, the
-intention ot' the United States to appropriate
the property, describing it as fully and uccu
rately as would be necessary in a conveyance,
and also stating the name of the owner or
owners thereof; secondly, the specific sum
of money that the United .States is willing to
pay therefor, which shall be such a sum as the
Secretary of the Treasury shall deem reason-
able ; thirdly, that if the owner or owners
do not, within a time to be specified in the
certificate, (which time the Secretary of the
Treasury may fix, allowing a reisouableperiod
after service or publication of the certificate,
as hereinalter ptovided,) accept said sum as a
full compensation for such property, then,
altera specified day, the United States will
cause the property intended to be appropriated
to be condemned to the United States, and the
valueofsuch property tobeassessed pursuantto
law. Oneof the certificates'shall be delivered to
each of the owners of the property intended
to be appropriated, if resident, within the dis-
trict, or left, at, his or her usual place of abode
therein; provided that if any owner be a
minor, idiot, or insane person, having a gum d-
iun resident in said district, service of said
certificate, m manm-r aforesaid, shall be made
on such guardian, which shall be deemed good
service on the ward; but if iiny owner or
guardian reside without said district, or his
place of residence be unknown to the Secre
tary of the Tieasury, then notice to him or
them may be given either by personal service
of such ceitilicHte, or by publishing the same
for lour consecutive weeks m some newspaper
of general circulation m said district. Another
of said certificates shall be filed and preserved
in the olbee of the Secretary of" the Treasury
with proof of the service or publication there-
of, showing the date or dates of such service
or publication ; and if such appropriation be
finally made, it shall he the duty of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury to indorse upon another
of said certificates the words " appropriation
made,'' with the date when the appropriation
was perfected, and to officially subscribe such
indorsement and cause such certificate and in-
dorsement to be recoided in the recorder's
office of the county ol Hamilton, in said State,
if any owner, his or her guardian, as afore-
said, shall, at, any time befoie the appropria-
tion mentioned 111 said certificate shall be
made, elect to take the compensation specified
in ttie certificate, or in case of joint ownership
or tenancy in common, his or her proper pro-
poition thereof, the Srcietary of the Treasury
shall cause the same to be paid to him or her,
or his 01 lier guardian, and shall take the
receipt of such owner or guardian therefor, and
upon such payment all the title or right of
such owner in or to the property shall vest in
the United States ; provided, however, that
ill case of joint ownership or tenancy in com-
mon, where some of the owners or tenants
elect, and others do not elect, to take the com-
pensation offered as aforesaid, payment to
those electing to take may, in the discretion of
the Secretary of the Treasury, be withheld
until the proceedings against those so refusing
or failing be terminated ; and if, upon the
termination of such proceedings, the Secretary
of the Treasury shall be of the opinion that,
the amount or amounts assessed, together with
those payable to the joint owner or tenant
electing to take the offer of the United States
as aforesaid, would be too great to justify the
intended appropriation, it shall be lawful for
the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the costs
of such proceedings and refuse to make the
appropriation ; in which event said costs shall
be so paid and nothing more ; and provided
further, that if any owner, his or her guardian,
electing to take the compensation offered by
the United States as aforesaid shall fail to
make that election until alter proceedings for
an assessment, shall be commenced as herein-
after provided, be or she shall, before receiv-
ing such compensation, if required by the
Secretary of the Treasury, pay the costs of
such proceedings; or if the proceedings be
against others, as well as hlmseif or herself,
his or her proper proportion of said costs, or
he or she may elect to let the United States
pay the same and deduct it from said com-
pensation.
The third section provides that if any
owner or owners, notified as provided in the
next preceding section, shall not, within the
time specified for that purpose in the certifi-
cate mentioned in said section, signify to the
Secretary of the Treasury his, her, or their
acceptance of the compensation offered by
said certificate to him, her, or them, it shall
be lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury,
at any time, after the expiration of the time
named in the certificate for such owner or
owners to accept the offer of the board, to file
one of the certificates, with proof of the ser-
vice or publication thereof, in the circuit, court
of the United States for the southern district
of Ohio ; and thereupon it shall be the duty
of the clerk of said court and the marshal of
the district, within one day after receiving
notice of such filing, to proceed to draw from
the names of persons returned to serve as
jurors in the court a jury of twelve, in the
same manner that juries are drawn for the trial
of causes in the court, for the purpose of
estimating or assessing the damages such
owner or owners shall receive by reason of
such appropriation; and the clerk shall im-
mediately return the.namesof jurors so drawn
to the court, which shall thereupon issue its
venire to the marshal; or, m case of his being
a party to the proceedings, to some other per-
son selected by the court for that purpose, and
sworn, who shall thereupon act in the prem-
ises, to summon the jurors, so drawn as
aforesaid, to attend on some day specified, in
the court, to be impaneled and sworn to render
a just verdict, in the mauner prescribed' by
law ; and the court shall, at, the time of issu-
ing such venire, issue a notice to the several
owners of the property described in such
certificate, of the time when such jury will
meet, in court and be impaneled as aforesaid ;
which notice the marshal, or other person ap-
pointed as aforesaid, shall serve upon the
party or parties therein named at the time of
serving such venire, provided rhatifsuch owner
or owners are non-residents of the district, or
are unknown, then the publication of the
objects and purposes of the proceedings
shall be made m some newspayer in general
circulation in the district, for thirty days next
preceding the time named in such venire;
which notice shall contain a pertinent descrip-
tion of the property sought to be appropriated,
and the name or names of the owners, if the
same be known, and the time and place of
the proceedings. The court shall have power
to issue subpena? and all other necessary
process, and either judge or the clerk thereof
shall have power to administer all necessary
oaths in the execution of the act.
The fourth section provides that it shall be
the duty of the marshal or other person ap-
pointed and qualified for the purpose, on
receiving such venire, to summon the persons
named therein, in the same manner as jurors
are summoned to attend the court; and jurors
may be challenged and vacancies filled as in
other cases. The jury shall be sworn to well
and truly assess the compensation to which
the owner may be entitled by reason of the
premises, without deduction for benefits to any
of his or her property. For good cause shown,
or by consent of the parties, they may be sent,
in such custody as the court shall direct, to
view the property, the court appointing the
person or persons whose duty it shall be to
show it to them; but all testimony snail be
given in open court. The United States shall
be entitled to open and close, in giving testi-
mony and in the argument. The verdictshall
be m writing, signed by the jurors, or their
foreman ; but the court, with the assent of the
jurors, may put it in proper form. A new
trial shall not be granted except for miscon-
duct of the jury, or for an erroneous ruling by
the court. Exception may be taken, as in
other cases, to any ruling of the court in mat-
ter of law, and a petition in error may be
prosecuted in the Supreme Court of the United
States, if filed within thirty days after the
rendition of the verdict, but not otherwise.
Such petition shall not be. filed without the
allowance of the Supreme court or one of the
justices thereof. And the proceedings shall
not be reversed for any error of form, or other
error not affecting the substantial justice of the
case. Upon a reversal of the proceedings a
procedendo may, in apropercase, be awarded,
and a new trial had, if thereby commanded.
The clerk of the court shall record the pro-
ceedings, including the certificate of intention
to appropriate and the proof of its service or
publication, filed in his office as aforesaid.
The fifth section provides that after such ap-
propriation is made it shall be the duty of the
clerk immediately to make up the cost bill of
such proceedings, when the Secretary of the
Treasury shall, without unnecessary delay, pay
the same and shall also pay the adjudged com-
pensation in favor of the proper party ; and if
the party entitled to such compensation sh-ill
not call for the same, the Secretary of the
Treasury shall nevertheless issue his official
warrant or certificate for the amount, and shall
retain it until called for ; and the money shall
be taken and held to be deposited in the Treas-
ury for the use and benefit of the party entitled
to the same from the date of such warrant or
certificate ; provided that no interest shall be
paid upon the compensation or costs as afore-
said ; provided, also, that the Secretary of
the Treasiiry may at, his option pay the costs
and refuse to make the appropriation, if, in his
judgment, the compensation assessed is too
great to justify the appropriation.
The sixth section provides that proof of the
service or publication of the certificate afore-
said, when required by this act, may be made
by the affidavit of any person having personal
knowledge of the fact.
The seventh section provides that if the
property appropriated, or to be appropriated,
shall belong to the heirs or devisees of a
decedent, and the names and places of resi-
dence of such hetrs or devisees, or of any or
either of them, shall be unknown to the Sec
retary of the Treasury, such persons whose
names and places of residence shall t)e un-
known may be described in all and singular the
the papers and proceedings aforesaid as the un-
known heir or heirs, devisee or devisees, as the
case may bej of the decedent, naming such
