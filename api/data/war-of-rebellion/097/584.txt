HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Petersburg, Va., April 5, 1865.

General WEITZEL,

Commanding, Richmond, Va.:

I find General Warren here under orders from General Meade to command the Defenses of City Point, Petersburg, and the troops on the South Side Railroad. The only troops here were Willcox's division, Ninth Corps which I have relieved. This leaves no troops here under Warren's command, and either relieves him and puts him under my command or leaves his duties, with respect to this place, only nominal. Have I any connection with him? If so, what, I ask, to settle a doubt of his, not mine. Please answer immediately.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, April 5, 1865.

Major-General HARTSUFF,

Petersburg:

You are in command. I was ordered to direct all of Meade's command to report to him. Please see that it is done.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, April 5, 1865.

Major-General HARTSUFF,

Petersburg:

Send a large brigade of your troops to relieve the garrison at City Point. Colonel Adams, Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry, with his regiment, has been ordered to report to you.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.
