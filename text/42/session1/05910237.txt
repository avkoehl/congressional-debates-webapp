APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

42d Cong.... 1st Sess.
Fourteenth Amendment—Mr. Blair.
Senate.
as Judge Woods had refused to appoint anymore
Democratic inspectors than the number of namesfor
each ward suggested by the Republican committee,
and they had only given in a number of names cor-
responding to the number of polls existing at the
former elections, the Democratic party was without
any inspector at nearly one third ol the polls on
election day, and the box and the management of
the election were entirely in the hands of the Radi-
cal commissioners, a cordon of Radical police pre-
venting citizens from standing near and watching
the conduct ot the election.
A week previous to the election the chairman of
this committee, in connection with Governor Voor-
hees, a member of the Democratic State central com-
mittee, had called upon Governor Warmoth and had
asked the appointment ot one Democratic commis-
sioner of election at each pol I out of tho three to be
appointed under the State law, and they were as-
sured by him that it should be done " at every poll
in the State," and referred them to B. P. Blanchard,
the superintendent of elections and registration,
who also promised that "it should be done," and
asked them to submitlists of suitable persons, which
they did with the promise on his part that the par-
ties would be notified and sworn in by himself per-
sonally. None of the parties having been notified
and sworn in up to one day prior to the election, so
far as we could learn, a sub-committee from this
body waited upon the Governor and superintendent
who informed the biib-committeo at a late hour on
the night prior to election day that neither his Ex-
cellency nor thesuperintendentintended to keep his
word in the matter ot appointment. The election
ensued, and under tho Radical State law no counting
took place at the polling-booths at the close of the
day, but the ballot-boxes were removed to the State
house and there remained, tho counting going on for
five lull days and nights'!
The lew commissioners we had, one at each one
ot two thirds ot the numberofpolK remained during
this time watching, sleeping, and eating on the bal-
lot boxes, at times arrested on frivolous pretexts and
at others driven from the custody of the ballots by
the arbitrary orders of the superintendent. Tne
Radical commissioner? being fourfold in number to
the Democrats, easily divided their watches and
relieved one another in guarding the boxes. It was
during this time that the boxes were manipulated
and the returns " cooked up " to Radical taste, a box
being sometimes counted,-and, the result not being
ot Radical flavor, recount after recouut was ordered
until it suited. At nearly every poll where wo had
commissioners the returns approximated closely to
the figures ot our canvass; but at those where we
weie unrepresented enormous Radical majorities
were lacked in the ballot-boxes sufficient to over-
come tLe Democratic majorities at the other polls
and reverse the true vote of the ward. It was in this
manner that New Orleans was carried by five thou-
sand majority by the Radical party in the last elec-
tion, the Governor and his satellites overriding and
circumventing the act of Congress in a manner pal-
pably fraudulent. Of this we are not only convinced
from our own knowledge, but several Radical com-
missioners have openly stated that several thousand
fraudulent vote3 were stuffed into the ballot-boxes,
sufficientjio turn the election in their Jfavor.
Very respectfully,
F. C. ZACHARIE,
Chairman Democratic Parish Central Committee,
Orleans, Louisiana.
Hon. M. C. Kerr, M. C., Washington, D. C.
Then, iu reference to thepublicdebtofLouis-
iana, the Senator remarked :
"The Senator evinces a readiness to adopt any
statement to tho disparagement of Republican gov-
ernments at the South that are made in the public
press. With eagerness he quotes from a New Orleans
paper a statement that the debt of Louisiana
amounts to $40,000,000."
I made no such statement from any news-
paper in New Orleans, and, as he well knew, the
statement that I made was from the report of
the auditor of the State of Louisiana, and that
report shows that the debt was $40,000,000 ;
and T now read the statement made by over
three hundred of the business men of New
Orleans:
New Orleans, March 18,1871.
The undersigned property-owners and tax-payers
of the city of New Orleans, satisfied that the State
Legislature has, at its last session, exceeded its
power, m the loans, indorsements, and other obli-
gations and grants authorized on tho f>art of the
State, tho total amount of which is limited by the
recent amendment of the constitution to §25.000,000,
already incurred, as shown by the annexed official
statement by the auditor, take this early oppor-
tunity of notifying bankers, brokers, and dealers in
securities, in this country and Europe, that they
consider all such loans, indorsements, and pledges
as null and of no value; that they will susraan tne
authorities in resisting their issue, and if issued,
will, by every legal means, endeavor to prevent the
payment of any interestor principal, or of any tax
levied fo" that purposo. They only recognize the
State dei>t proper, amounting to $25,021,73*140, as
shown in the accompanying exhibit of the auditor,
and they class the "accruing debt" with the illegal
legislation previously referred to:

I have also a letter here from a very respons*
ible man in New Orleans, who writes to me as
follows:
New Orleans, Aprill, 1871.
. Sir: Ideemitmyduty,asaLouisianian,toputyou
in possession of such information as will enable you,
should you so elect, to refute the hazarded asser-
tions of Mr. Joseph R. West, Senator from this
State.
Tho State debt up to the 31st of December, 1870,
was §40,416.73140, and between that date and the 3d
of March, 1871, it was increased some $10,000,000.
That our citizens realize the true btate of affairs
is best attested by the inclosed circular, to which are
attached the names of our best and wealthiestmen,
men representing over forty millions of money.
Of the attempt made—and it I remember rightly no
participantwas moro active than thenew Senator—
to prevent the perpetration of the railroad swindles,
I will not speak, but yet cannot refrain fiom inclos-
ingsuch documentary proof as will enable you to
see that the object was notso much "to prevent the
trade of Texas from being wrested from New Or-
leans" as to provide for thoimpecuniosity of a parcel
of adventurers in and out of office.
Yours, respectfully,
l6uis a. wiltz.
Hon. F. P. Blair, "Washington, D, O.
That letter covers a paper signed by over
three hundred men, declaring that the con-
stitution limited the debt to $25,000,000, and
warning all persons not to take any of the
debt; that it would not be paid and could not
be paid j that it was illegal. The signers of
this paper are among the most respectable
people in New Orleans. I know many of
them myself.
I hold in my hand a Radical newspaper pub-
lished in New Orleans, which comments upon
the speech of the Senator from Louisiana and
says:
"To claim that the last election in the State was
fair is to say that there were not gigantic frauds
practised in almost every parish under the direction
of a bolting committee, improvised, by the Governor,
to cripple a Stato central committee, deliberately
selected by the party in a State convention; to say
that a vast amount of money was not exrorted for
election purposes from officials, even the humblest,
that ballot-boxes were not stuffed, that fraudulent
returns by irresponsible hands were not made, 'hat
all this was to assist the interests of the State or
ratify vital amendments to our charter, and not to
remove the Governor's ineligibility for tour more
years of wanton license. And when the Senate saw
the chairman of this abnormal committee, whoso
brain devised and whose hands had abetted the
vicious plan, in the very man who, as Senator,
avowed the election was fair, it can be understood
how much larger a measure of pity than of confi-
dence he received.
" Equally indirect was his denial of the increase
of the Stato debt to the extent of fifteen millions
beyond the constitutional limit. State Auditor Gra-
ham, astaunch Republican, is a trustworthy w-tuess,
surely, and the recent admonition of alt our heavy
commercial men, addressed to northern capitalists,
still further neutralizes the Senator's pretense. If ho
insists that the actual liabilities are but $25,000 000,
he but begs the question. The constitutional amend-
ment is better anthority for that than even the Sen-
ator himself. But Blair's purpose was to disclose
the corruption in the executive and legislative prov-
inces here, and if Mr. West consents to the infer-
ence that the excess of $16,000,000 has been created
by the Governor and his accomplices in the Assem-
bly in clear violation of tho public will, he announces
his patron to be, alter all, just what Blair charges
him to bo. If this excess, or a considerable part of
it, is not extorted from the State, it will be because
of honest James Graham and not because of H. C.
Warmoth."
Upon the point of its being a peaceful elec-
tion, this paper, the New Orleans Standard,
says:
" Was therenot' a single bayonet' in New Orleans
in the election to which he adverts? Does not tho
Senator recall something more formidable than a
bayonet—batteries of solid artillery, for instance?
What power, indeed, did preserve the public peace?
The testimony of the United States marshal of this
district clearly shows.
"In an official letter addressed to the Attorney
General on the 16th day of November, 1870, just alter
the election, the marshal says, ' the national Gov-
ernment alone has been the power to check or arrest
the evil-doer during the political contest just passed,
and all loyal men join in giving thanks to the ad-
ministration of U. S. Grant that has guarantied and
protected them in the exercise of their political rights
during the election. It is in strange contrast with
the riots and scenes of 1808, though with the samo
State government.'"
This article goes on to say :
"It was not 'without the presence of a single bay-
