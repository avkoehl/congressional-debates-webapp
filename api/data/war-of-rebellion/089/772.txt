General MILES:

The signal officer reports that the enemy advanced their picket-line 100 or 150 yards during the night at a point about northwest from these headquarters and in front of Fort Welch. The corps officer of the day made no report to that effect. Will you ask your division officer of the day (for yesterday) how far this statement of the signal officer is well founded?

Major-General, Commanding.
