Commanding Second Corps:

Your dispatch is received informing the major-general commanding of the presence of Longstreet's force. I am directed to say that the only reserve force of the army (one division of the Ninth Corps) is here, and will be ordered to your support, should it become absolutely necessary. Call for it, therefore, only in case of the last necessity.

General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch just received, informing me that I can have a division from Burnside in case of absolute necessity. They are pressing us on the road a good deal. If more force were here now I could use it; but I don't know whether I can get it in time or not. I am filling up the boxes of the men who are returning, and re-establishing my lines, closing up with right. Barlow is putting in a brigade
