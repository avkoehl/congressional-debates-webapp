Public Printing—Mr. Taylor.
Ho. 6? Reps.
to the system of publication adopted by Con-
gress, to the useless extravagance to which that
system has fed, and to the outrageous corruption
and venality attending it. The abuses connected
with it have become so wide-spread and danger-
ous, so intolerable, in fact, in their influences, that
it would be better for Congress to forego all the
advantages of publication than to continue a sys-
tem fraught with so much evil. It is well known
that combinations have been forced for the pur-
pose of controlling the election of Public Printer;
and that, through such means, parties totally un-
able to perform the work have been elected. And
it appears to me that circumstances almost au-
thorize the belief that those parties never expected
to do the public printing. Congress and the coun-
try know that they sold out the Government
work at a large bonus; and the public ought to
know that Congress now pays a double price for
composition—an excess wnich forms an aggregate
almost equal to the bonus referred to; almost suf-
ficient to liquidate or pay it. ^
But more: it is known th&t combinations h&ve
existed for the purpose of levying a tax upon all
persons engaged in performing labor or in sup-
plying materials to the Government in connection
with the printing. There is no doubt of the fact
that contracts have been farmed out, and that
contractors have m&de a provision in the amount
charged for the commissions which they knew
had to be paid. Thus, as has been very correctly
remarked by one of our leadingjournals, the pub-
lic printing has become the center of the lobby
corruptions. Sir, in my opinion, it is the heart
of this great political malady. Around the ave-
nues of public printing, and its adjuncts—engrav-
ing and lithographing—stand arrayed a hungry
swarm of lobbyists, of middle men, ready at all
times to fleece the honest mechanic or artisan, to
corrupt the official, and, if possible, to defraud
•the Government.
That I might be a-ble to lay before the commit
tee exact and reliable information on the subject
of printing, I have obtained, from the officers to
whom I have referred, the certified statements,
which I present, of the cost of reporting the pro-
ceedings of Congress and of the Congressional
Globe; of printing, binding, engraving, litho-
graphic printing, &c. The cost of the paper used,
I have taken from the very valuable report of the
present Superintendent of Public Printing.
I submit the statement marked G, which I re-
ceived through the politeness of the Secretary of
the Treasury:

Treasury Department, Register's Office, January 14; 1859.
F. BIGGER, Register.
Mr. Chairman, it will be seen that the accounts
for printing, engraving, and for other matters con-
nected with this subject, are kept at the Treasury
Department for each fiscal year, and not against
each Congress. The amount paid during the last
fiscal year embraces the deficiencies on the print-
ing ordered by the Thirty-Third" and Thirty-
Fourth Congresses, for which special provision
was made at the last session. From the state-
ment of the Register of the Treasury, there ap-
pears to have been paid on account of public
printing, during the last five years, the sum of
$3,370,374 05.
-This sum does not include the paper account,
which, for the same period, amounted to the sum
of $1,678,453 47; nor does it include the amount
paid for copies of the Congressional Globe which
were purchased for distribution. By reference
to the table marked D, it will be seen that the
House took twenty-four copies for each member
during the Thirty-Third and Thirty-Fourth, and
for the first session of the Thirty-Fifth, Con-
gresses—amounting, for the Thirty-Third Con-
gress, to §51,768; for the Thirty-Fourth Congress,
to $52,056, and for the first session of the Thir-
ty-Fifth Congress, to $34,704; making together,
for the period specified in the Register's report,
the sum of $138,528.
It will be seen, on the table furnished by the
Secretary of the Senate, marked B, that the Sen-
ate,during the same period, took,for the Thirty-
Third Congress, Globes amounting to the sum of
$51,894; for the Thirty-Fourth Congress they paid
f64,188 58; and for the first session of theThirty-
'ifth Congress, $59,294 28—making together
the sum of $175,376 86. As these Globes are
taken for distribution as other books are, it ap-
pears proper to include them in this statement.
These sums, added together, give us the total of
$5,362,732 38. It will be remembered that this
amount embraces the public printing, engraving,
!ithographing,binding, and the paper for the same,
and the reports of congressional proceedings, with
the Globes purchased for distribution during the
last five years.
But, in order to get the entire expense grow-
ing out of the public printing, it is necessary to
ascertain the cost of the folding-room, of the pa-
per and other material used in that department,
clerks 'hire, and various other matters, which may
be safely estimated at $100,000 per annum; and
last, but equally importantin this connection, we
should estimate the cost of sending these heavy
documents through the post office over the coun-
try. Into these items I have no desire, had I the
time, to inquire.
The question very naturally arises, how much
of all this expense is necessary to carry on the
Government? The present able and faithful Su-
perintendent of the Public Printing, shows, in his
annual report, that the entire cost of the printing
ordered by this Congress, at its first session^ tfras
$496f610 25. From this sum We may deduct, for
extra work and materials, riot tfece'ste&ry to .the
legislation of the fcou'nfry, from tfte Seriate ac-
count, $8&,3b7 06; and from the House account,
$190,928,82—^making $278,235 88; leaving a feral-
ahce of$218,374 37 for necessary work and mate-
riafs. To this slim should be added about $2$,0(/0
for binding th'e regular documents; which makes
the total expense |^48,2'40 69 for the lortg Session.
I am satisfied that tne necessary congressiorfal
printing and biridi'rig can be done for $250,1500.
The Department work: o'ughtnottocostmore than
$50,000 per annum, tfhich tto'trld mrike the total
cost $300,000.
Mr. Chairman, in order further to illustrate the
rapid growth of congressional expenses, let me
refer to the Congresrsional'GIo'be and the present
mode of reporting our proceedings. I will notdetain
the House by reference to the early history of this
matter. For all practical purposes, it is sufficient
to commence toith the action of the Senate in 1841,
which led to the present mode of reporting and
publishing congressional proceedings. On the 3d
day of July, 1841, the Senate appointed a select
committee to examine into the suoject of report-
ing, &c. That committee invited propositions or
plans for this work from various parties, and after-
wards reported the projects to the Senate. (See
Senate Documents for 1841, first session Twenty-
Seventh Congress, No. 114.) It will be found,
by reference to that report, that Messrs. Blaif
and Rives proposed the following plan:
<( The Reporting.
" I. The Senate to select, by ballot or otherwise, five rei
porters, who shall be sworn to gfve faithful reports of the
proceedings of the Senate and the remarks of the Sen-
ators.
" 2. They shall take notes insuccession, and when their
turn is completed, shall retire from the Senate Chamber
and prepare their copy for the printer, so that the copy for
the whole day's pioceedmgs may be in his hand's within
three hours alter adjournment; the reporters to be paid each
at the rate of fifty dollars per week.
" The Publication,
" Blair & Rives will engage to publish the entire debates
of the sessions of the present (Twenty-Seventh) Congress,
as handed to ihein by the Senate reporters, in lheir daily
^aper. They will engage that the paper shall be put to press
within An hour and a halffrom the period that the last copy
is furnished ; and m five hours from the time of adjourn-
ment. One hundred and fofir copies of the paper will be
ready to be delivered on the order of the Secretary of the
Senate, or they will be delivered By nine o'clock in the
morning, at the Senate Chamber, free of all charge to the
Senate. The proceedings will be subsequently published,
unconnected with any other matter but congressional pro-
ceedings, in a quarto form, suitable for binding; and such
Senators as preter it may have an equivalent for their daily
copies in that form. Blair & Rives will also engage to fur-
nish the proof slips of the proceedings to any paper in this
District, which will enter into agreement to publish them
entire."
11 The Expense.
" The entire cost of a corps of "reporters to the Senate
which would enable a full and faithful report of their pro-
ceedings to be published on theeveningof the day on which
they occurred, and of two copies of the paper containing
them to each Senator, would be $250 per week, $3,250 per
session of three month, $6,500 per session of six months,
or an average of $4,875 per session, or per annum."
Messrs. Gales & Seaton made a similar prop-
osition.
Mr. Jonathan Elliot offered another project,
more in detail, and still further reducing the ex-
pense. He made the reporting to cost $181 per
week, $2,353 for a short session, and $4,706 for the
long session of twenty-six weeks. This prop-
osition provided for five hundred copies of the
proceedings.
It will be remembered that these projects em-
braced the Senate's proceedings only, and that
we must double these sums in order to get at the
expense of both Houses. The difference in the
expense between the Houses under these projects
must be very small. The project of Messrs. Blair
& Rives Would have cost the Government about
$19,500 per Congress, or about $9,750 per annum.
Taking this, then, as a starting point, let us trace
the history of this matter, ana see how the cost
of reporting and publishing the proceedings of
Congress has swollen during the last eighteen
years.
During the Thirty-Second Congress the report-
ing and the Globe cost the Government about
$114,500. Tothissum there must be added, say
$16,000 for binding, making the total $130,500.
