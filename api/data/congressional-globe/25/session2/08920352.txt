under the permissive operation of the joint resolu-
tion of 1816 The Secietary of the Treasury is
now acting under that resolution; and no bank, no
State, no public body, has asked him to go farther
than he has gone Politicians alone have taken up
this matter, and have proposed, for the first time
since the foundation of the Government—for the
first tim  in 48 years—to compel the Government
to receive paper money for «s> dues The pretext
is, to aid the banks in resuming' Tins, indeed, is
a marvellous pretty conception1 Aid the banks to
resume1 Why, sir, we cannt t prevent them fiom
resuming Every solvent, commercial bank m the
United States either has resumed, or has declared
its determination lo do so in the course  f the year.
The insolvent, and the political banks, which did
not mean to resume, will have to follow the New
York example, or die1 Mr Biddle's Bank must
follow the New York lead, or die' The good banks
are witn the country, the rest we defy The po-
litical banks may resume or not, as they pleas*, or
as they dare If they do not, they die1 Public
opinion, and the laws of the land, will exterminat 
them. If the president of the rmscilled Bank of
the United States has made a mistake in íecom-
mendmg indefinite non-resumption, and in propos-
ing to establish a confederation of broken banks,
and has found out his mistake, and wants a pic-
text for retreating, let him invent one There is
no difficulty in the ease Any thing that the Go-
vernment does, oi does not—any thing that has
happened, will happen, or can happen—will an-
swer the purpose Let the president oí the Bank
of the United States give out a tune incontinently
it will be sung by every bank man in the United
Slates, and no matter how ridiculous the ditty may
be, it will be celebrated as superhuman music
Sir, the honest commercial banks have resumed,
ormein to resume They have resumed, nit up-
on the fictitious and delusive credit of legislative
enactments, but upon the solid basis of gold and
silver The hundred millions of specie which we
have accumulated in the country, has done the
business To that hundred millions tht country
is mdebled for this early, easy, proud and glorious
resumption' aid here let us do justice to the men
of this day—to the policy of General Jackson—and
to th success of the expeuments—to which we are
indebted for these one hundred millions Let us
contrast the events and efiects of the stoppages in
1814, and in 1819, with the events ind effects of
the stoppage in 1837, and let us see the differences
bftween them, and the causes oí that difference
The stoppage of 1814 compelled the Government to
use depreciated bank noles during the remainder
of the war, anduptoihejear 1817 Treasuty notes,
even bearing a laige interest, wer^ d°preciite 1 ten,
twenty, thirty per cent Bank notes were at an
equal depreciation The losses to the Government
from depreciated paper in loans alone, during the
war, weie coaipuled by a committee oi the House
of Representatives at eighty millions of dollars
Individuals suffered in ihe same proportion, and
e/ery transaction of life bore the nnpiess of the
general calamity Specie was not to be had
There was, nationally speaking, none in the coun-
tri The specie standard was gont, the measure
of values was lost, a fluctuating paper money, rum-
o si) depreciated, was the medium of all ftchanges
To extncdte itself from this deplorable condition,
the exptdiTt of a National C nk was resorted to
—that measure of so much humiliation, and of so
much misfortune, to the Republican party For
the moment it seemed to give relief, and to restore
national prosperity, but treacherous and delusive
was the seeming boon The banks resumed—re-
lapsed—and every evil of the previous suspension
returned upon the country with increased and ag-
gravated force I ha\e apt authority forsa>mg
that the seven years ot most disastrous fortune which
eve>- this country experienced, were those which
immediaHy ensued the establishment of this se-
cond United States Bank, and which covered the
period of its own paralysis, and the general break-
ing of the local banks I have authority for this,
and I read it from a'^peech delivered in the Se-
nate n the year 1832
11 Eight ytars ago it was my painful duty to present to the
other housa of Congress an unexaggeiated picture ofthe general
distress pervading the whol« land    We mart «11 y t remember
some of its frightful features    Wo all know that the people
weie then oppressed and borne ¿own by an enormous load of
debt, that ruinous sales and sacrifices were every where made
of real estate, that stop laws, and relleflavvs, and paper money
were adopted to save the people fiom impending destruction,
that a deficit m the public revenue existed, which compelled
Government to seize upon, and direct from lis legitimate ot>
ject, the appropriation to the sinking fund, to redeem the na
tional debt,  and that our commerce and navigation were
threatened with a complete patalysis    In short, en, if Iwere
to select any term of seven years since the adoptnn of the pre
sent Constitution, which exhibited a scene of the most wide
spread desolation ami dismay, it would be exactly that term of
seven yean which immediately preceded the establishment of
the tariff OÍ1834 ''
Such is the picture, drawn by a hand [Mr Clay]
which makes it authority in tins case, ot the deso-
lation of the country during the period of bank
stoppage, from 1817 to 1824 The Bank of the
United States was then in fall life, and was no
shield or support to the country in all this calami-
ty, nor did it aid the country in recovering from it
The same speech informs us that the tariff was then
the grand panacea for all the calamities of the
country' and that the act of 1834 for the protection
of American industry lifted the people from the
abjss of rum in which they were plunged, and, in
return for their seven years of unparalleled calami
ly, gave them a jubilee of seven years of unprece-
dented prosperity This is the statement of our
revived prospen y from the same hand
If the term of seven years were to be soléete 1 of the
greatest pr i-pemy which tins people hive ever enjoyed since
the establishment of their piesent Constitution it would be
exactly that penol of seven ytars which immediately lollowed
the passage oí the tariff act oí 1824 '
Such was the language a few j ears ago Then
tariff was every thing, bank nothing The want
of a tariff for «even years, then, ruined the coun-
try, the presence of it for seven years restored
prosperity Now bank is every thing, and tariff is
nothing The Joss of the National Bank has sunk
us into woe and poverty, its presence is to re-esta-
blish national prosperity And thus we play off,
on this grave theatre of legislation, these juggling
representations tedecsive the people, as if iheyhad
neither memory to recollect the past, nor judgment
to undeistand the present, nor eyes to see the play-
eis shifting their parts with the shifting of the
changing scenes
But tort turn to the point, the contrast between the
effects and evenls of former bank stoppages, and
the effects and events of the present one The effectb
of the former were to smk ihe price of labor and of
property to the lowest point, to fill the States with
stop laws, relief law% property laws, and tender
laws, torum nearly all debtors, and to make pioperty
change hands at fatal ratts, to compel the Federal
Government to witness the heavy depreciation of
its Treasury notes, to receive its revenues in depre-
ciated paper, and, finally, to submit to the esta-
blishmentoi aNitionalBank as the means of getting
it out of its deplorable condition—that bank, the esta-
blishment of which was followed by the seven years of
the greatest calamity which ever afflicted the country,
and from whwh calamity we then had to seek relief
from the tariff, and not Jrom more banks How dif-
ferent the events ef the present 'ime' The banks
stopped m May, 1837, they resume in May,
1838 Their paper depreciated but little, pro-
perty except in a few places, was but slightly af-
fected, the p ice of produce continued good, people
paid their debts v, ithout sacrifices , Tieasury notes,
in defiance of political and moneyed combinations
to depress them, kept at or near par, in many
places above it, the Government was never
brought to receive its revenues in depreciated
paper, and finally, all good banks are resuming
in the brief space of a year, and no National Bank
has been created Such is the contrast between
the two periods, and now, sir, what is all this
owing to ? what is the cau e of this great difference
in two similar periods of bank stoppages, 1 It is
owing to our gold bill of 1834, by which we cor-
rected the erroneous standard of gold, and which
is now gn mg u<; an avalanche of that metal, it is
owing to our silver bill of the same year, by which
we repealed the disastrous act of 1819, against the
circulation of foreign silver, and which is now
spreading the Mexican dollars all over the country,
it is owing to our movements against small notes
under twenty dollars, to our branch mints,
and the increased activity of the mother mint,
to  our determination  to   revive  the currency
of the Constitution, and to our deter  watioa not to
fall back upon tne local paper currencies of the
States for a national currency. It was owing to
these measures thai we have passed through this
bank stoppage in a Style so different from Khatjhas
been done heretofore. It is owing to our /'experi-
ments" on the currency—to our "humbug" of a gold
and silyer currency—to our "tampering" with the
monetary system—it js owing to these that we have
had this signal success in, this last stoppage, andaré
now victorious over all the prophets of wo, and
over all the architects of mischief. These experi-
ments, this humbugging, and this tampering, has in-
creased our specie in six years from twenty mil-
lions to one hundred millions, and it is these one
hundred millions of gold and silver which has sus-
tained the country and the Go\ eminent under the
shock of the stoppage, has enabled the honest
solvent banks to resume, and will leave the in-
solvent and political banks without excuse or jus-
tification for not resuming Our experiments—I
love the word, and am sorry that gentlemen of the
Opposition have ceased to repeat it—have brought
an avalanche of gold and silver into the country,
it is saturating us with the precious metals, it has
relieved and sustained the country, and now when
these experiments have been successful—have tri-
umphed over all opposition—gentlemen cease their
ridicule, and go to work with their paper money
resolutions to force the Government to use paper,
and thereby to drive off the gold and silver which
our policy has brought into the country, destroy
the specie basis of the banks, give us an exclusive
paper currency again, and produce a new expan-
sion and a new explosion Gentlemen cease their
idle ridicule, and now go to work to make laws 10
defeat us, and defeat us they will, if they pass iheir
laws We despise their ridicule, but we cannot
despise laws Ridicule was harmless, but laws
will be potent Ridicule could not prevent gold
and silver from coming to the country, but paper
money laws will expel it We yesterday voted an
appropriate n for the Southern Exploring expedi-
tion, and now mark me, remember what I say
Pass this resolution to compel the Government to
receive paper money, and before that expedition
returns, a new expansion of the currency, and a
new explosion of the banks, will take place, and
when they take place, they will be charged
upon the folly and wickedness of the present Ad-
ministration.
Justice to the men of this day requires these things
to be stated They have avo ded the errors of
1811 They have avoided the pit into which they
saw their predecessors fall. Those who prevented
the renewal of the bank charter in 1811 did no-
thing else but prevent its renewal, they provided no
substitute for the notes of the bank, did nothing to
restore the currency of the Constitution, nothing *o
revive the gold currency, nothing to increase the
specie of the country. They fell back upon the
exclusive usé of local bank notes, without even
doing any thing to strengthen the local banks, by
discarding their paper under twenty dollars. They
fell back upon ihe local banks, and the consequence
was, the total prostration, the utter helplessness,
the deplorable inability of tne Government to take
care of itself, or to relieve and restore tne country,
when the banks failed Those who prevented the
recharter of the second Bank of the United States
had seen all this, and they determined to avoid
such error and calamity. They sat out to revive
the national gold currency, to increase the silver
currency, and to reform and strengiben the bank-
ing system. They sat out to do these things, and
they have done them. Against a powerful com-
bined political and moneyed confederation, they
have succeeded, and the 100,000,000 of gold
and silver now in the country attests the greatness
of their victory, and ensures the prosperity of the
country against the machinations of the wicked
and the factious
It is due to General Jackson and his friends to
state and to procla.m these successful results of
' their policy The country now feels these results
in the early, easy, victorious resumption of specie
payments, without ¿he aid of a National Bank, it
teels them in Ihe revival of business and confi-
dence, sad in, the lestorauo  of the geneml f re*
