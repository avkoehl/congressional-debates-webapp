about a good understanding when it is so important one should exist.

I write I know when I say that General Johnston never since I have been with him has spoken one word of unkindness about the President; on the other hand has indulged frequently in language of respect and regard for him, and if any other impression has been sought to be made on the mind of your brother, as I have reason to believe is the case, it is the work, I repeat, of mischief-makers and meddlers - I may add calumniators. With the military questions involved in the Mississippi campaign I have nothing to do. I cannot help thinking that if errors have been committed they had better be canvassed after the enemy have been put a little farther from our doors; but on the personal bearing of the case I feel that I am not wrong in communicating to you what I know touching the feelings of General Johnston. I write this letter of my own motion and on my own responsibility.

With high personal consideration and respect, I have the honor to be, dear sir, your obedient servant,

E. J. HARVIE,

Colonel and Inspector-General.
