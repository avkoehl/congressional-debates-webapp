The rebel Government will deliver a large number of our prisoners to us near Wilmington during the present and ensuing week. If our agent of exchanges is not there, receive them and forward to Annapolis. Do not allow this exchange of prisoenrs to interfere in any manner with your proposed military operations. Relieve General Meagher, to proceed to his place of residence and report by letter to the Adjutant-General For orders. Richmond papers of to-day report that Charleston was evaucated on the 14th [17th]. General Sherman is in possession of Columbia. Beauregard is falling back toward Charlotte, N.

HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Town Creek, February 20, 1865-11 a.m.

I have one brigade across the creek by the flat-boat, another passing. They will soon move around to the flank of the enemy's position.

TOWN CREEK, February 20, 1865-6 p.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding:

After great labor I succeeded in getting three brigades across the creek and through the rice fields, and about 4 o'clock struck the Wilmington road nearest the river, some two miles in the rear of the rebel position. I ordered Moore's brigade across to the Wilmington road furthest from the river, and with Casement's and Steele's brigades came straight down in rear of the rebels. They had a light line of works facing the rear and two guns in position. Our men charged, carrying the line, capturing the artillery, and about 375 prisoners, including the colonel commanding the brigade. I hope Moore has intercepted others who fled toward the Manchester road in utter confusion. My casualties are about thirty. There is no enemy where the fleet are exploding shells.

J. D. COX,

Major-General, Commanding.
