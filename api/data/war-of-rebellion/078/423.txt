Thanks for your good news. I am rejoiced to hear of Sheridans' success. The enemy will have cause to remember the 19th of September. Our success at so many different points must help us with the country, and I earnestly hope the army will be sufficiently strengthened by the draft to enable it to advance again at all points. The rebellion is tottering.
