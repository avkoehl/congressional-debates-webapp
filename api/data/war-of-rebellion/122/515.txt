Governor MORGAN, Astor House, New York:

Secure transportation to-day and forward immediately to Washington the three regiments intended for Sherman, and all others that you can possibly send. Give them arms and start them. Sherman has been ordered here with all his force. Let me know immediately what you can do.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

Have seen General Sherman. His regiments will require all the cars to-night and to-morrow. I will send two regiments on Monday.

SIR: I have ordered the Fire Zouaves to move forthwith to the Battery with two days' cooked rations, intending to send them to Fort Monroe on Monday, if that is the pleasure of the Government. Answer immediately.

HARRISBURG, September 14, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Telegraph Guss, who has three independent companies at West Chester, to join Coulter, who has six independent and is here-Coulter to be colonel and Guss lieutenant-colonel. The regiment can be then sent forward with those raised by the State. That will be better for Guss than for me to take his companies. Do, if at all possible, send us arms-rifles and muskets. I fear we will have trouble to send them without. I hope we will come up to your expectations.
