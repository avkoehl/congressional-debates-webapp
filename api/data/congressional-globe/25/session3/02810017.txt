APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
IT
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout.
Senate & Ho, of Rets,?
show that the money for which he is accountable
does not exceed the $201,096 40 reported by him
in the last official abstract of his account as the
true balance It would, also, be much pleased if
it should happen, as promised in his letter of the
13th of April last, that "on the adjustment of my
[his] accounts, the amount due to the Govern-
ment will be immediately paid."
But it is an unpleasant duty to add, that the
examination into his supposed defalcations was
not instituted on slight grounds, nor legal pro-
ceedings commenced for so large an amount till
sufficient facts were developed to produce a clear
conviction with the accounting officers that the
default was of the aggravated character already
described
2 I would next submit a few remarks on the
modes that exist, under the present laws, for de-
tecting faults of collecting officers, in order that
you may judge whether they are sufficient, or re-
quire additional legislation The first one is mere-
ly by a regulation which requires the weekly
returns before alluded to, and which was volun
tardy introduced by the Department nearly forty
years ago This regulation provides that a sum-
mary statement of accounts shall be transmitted
each week from the large poi ts, and by subse-
quent modifications, each month from the smaller
ones It is made to the head of the Department,
and should exhibit a true abstract of the condition
of the receipts and payments by the collector
during the preceding week Originally, it is pre-
sumed that this return was required more for cor-
rect information, and to enable the Department to
draw at times foi the money on hand, than as a
check on peculation, but if the statements in it do
not agree with each other, or do not, on their
face, exhibit facts that appear probable, or do not
balance, then suspicion is excited, and a defalca
tion, if one exist, can, by further and full exam-
ination, be detected So if the sum retained on
hand appears too large for meeting the engage-
ments of the office, a draft can be isbued for the
amount, or an order given for its deposit, as has
frequently been done If either is not complied
with,nor sufficient reasons assigned for delay, the
default may then be discovered But if none of
these circumstances happen, suspicion is not ex-
cited through those weekly statements It will be
seen, however, that, generally, it is not possible
for a default to occur without its appearing on
them, unless they are made incorrect through de-
liberate fiaud and falsehood In the case of Mr
Swartwout, none of these statements since 1830,
when his delinquencies are supposed to have com-
menced, are known to have disclosed any fact
tending to excite suspicion of his misconduct, and
if money was collected or expended in amounts
differing from the face of the abstracts, (as is now
believed to have been the case,) it must have been
concealed by a series of false returns during the
whole period of seven or eight years Some of
those returns, under Secretaries Ingham and Mc-
Lane, may have been destroyed by the conflagia
tion of the Treasury building in 1833, but none of
them now found, whether made under them or
Secretaries Duane, Taney, or myself, appear to
evince anything calculated to cause distrust of his
integrity
The other mode now in use for detecting de-
faults in collecting officers, and which is the only
one provided by Congress, (except the revising
power, in some respects, and at some ports, by
the naval officer, hereafter to be considered,) is,
through the quarterly settlements that are required
to be made by collectors with the accounting offi
cers of the Tieasury Those officers are the First
Auditor and the First Comptroller These settle-
ments are devolved on them alone by Congress,
without requiring the vouchers and accounts to be
submitted to the head of the Department, or any
other officer, either for revision, approbation, or
rejection
In that branch of their official business which
relates to the adjustment of accounts, you are
aware that it has been long since settled that the
Secretary of the Treasury, or even the President,
does not possess any legal authority to aid in
making the adjustment, or to overrule their de-
cisions
No. 2
The acts of Congress on this subject first pro-
vide that if a collector neglects to present his ac-
counts and vouchers for settlement quarterly, the
balance against him, so far as it can be ascer-
tained, shall be reported by the Comptroller to the
law agent, or the Solicitor of the Treasury, for
suit, and the neglect be also reported to the Pres-
ident, in order that he may remove the incumbent,
if still in office It is also directed, that if a bal
anee exists on a settlement, and is not paid, the
Comptroller shall cause a suit to be instituted for
its recovery. Whenever a default of the latter
kind occurs, it is therefore considered not only
the duty of the Comptroller to proceed with the
suit, but it is expected, though omitted to be re
quired in the acts of Congress, that he will apprise
the head of the Department or the President of
the delinquency which has occurred, in order that
the case of such collector, if still in office, may
be examined by the President, and a decision
made upon the propriety of continuing him longer
in office
It is understood that the Comptroller has always
exercised some discretion in respect to bringing
actions for balances on hand, by not forthwith
instituting suits if the balances be small, or the
reasons for retaining them for a time appear to be
satisfactory But if those balances be large, and
sufficient reasons are not offered to justify delay,
or it the collector's term of office has expired, the
Comptroller should deem it a duty to proceed at
once, under the law, to enforce the collection of
the money due
Several reasons exist why the accounting offi
cers, for the time being, did not discover the de-
falcation in this case, or repoit it sooner to the
law officer, and to the head of tne Department or
the President     Most of them are detailed in the
two  annexed  reports on that subject from the
present First Auditoi and First Comptroller, in
reply to inquiries made by this Department     In
some of the reasons assigned there is great weight
| The customs collected at New York equal nearly
two thirds of the whole amount in all the United
I States     Difficulties  doubtless exist in detecting
| defaults under the present laws at ports where the
I business is so large, the accounts are so compli-
cated, and the necessary delays in settlement so
great
The difficulties in making an earlier discovery
in this case would seem to have been increased by
the custom, which it is understood has long ex
isted in the Auditor's Office, not to make detailed
examinations of the bond accounts at large ports,
unless it may be when doubts arose in relation to
their correctness
The bonds on hand at one time at New York
alone exceeded ten thousand in number The
delay of three months, which is allowed by law
to collectors in preparing for settlements, and the
false returns which appear to have been resorted
to by the collector of New York, in his weekly
reports, with a view to prevent suspicion and
detection at an early day through those returns,
augmented still further the obstacles to a prompt
detection
The death of one of the clerks in the Auditor's
Office, who has had the immediate charge of set-
tling the accounts for that port, and the recent
change m the head of the bureau, as well as the
death of the Comptroller who was in office dunng
most of the period of the default, rerder it imprac-
ticable to ascertain with accuracy all the circum-
stances and reasons why suspicion was not there
sooner excited, but those already enumerated are
supposed to have been the principal ones It
seems apparent, however, from the official repoits
before referred to, that many of the defalcations
in this case happened under such circumstances,
and were so concealed as to render it difficult, if
not impossible, to detect them sooner by the ac
counting officers under the existing laws, and it
is supposed that they could not all have been
eventually discovered and exposed, except by the
aid of those persons in the custom house at New
York, who were aware of the deceptions practiced
In respect to the remaining legal check on the
collector, and through which his defaults may at
times be detected, it consists of a naval officer,
authorized at a few ports, and required by law to
examine and certify to the various expenditures
made, as well as the assessment of the duties col-
lected
But it appears that the naval officer at New?
York, if able to perform the task, has not for A
long period, or at least during the seventeen" years
that have elapsed since a circular issued by the
Comptroller in 1821, considered it his duty to cer-
tify to the expenditures and accounts generally,
but only to certain portions of them, and to th*
correct assessment of the duties
That circular, unfortunately, tended to remove
a check on the collector, m some particulars very
essential, and has been repealed by the present
Comptroller
It must also be apparent that the real auditor or
the custom-house should be attached to the naval
office, rather than that of the collector, as he la
now a nominee of the latter, and subject to be
neither appointed or removed bj* the Department
or the President.
Thus situated, his statements and acts are hable
to correspond with the collector's wishes, and can
by fraud almost invariably conceal default  so as
not to be detected by the accounting officers, or
even the naval officer
Some of the new instructions given by thií De-
partment to theaccountmg officers when the default
was suspected, and of the various steps which
were required to be taken to prevent, as far as-1
possible, similar occurrences hereafter, may be
seen in the copies of letters annexed
I do not flatter myself, however, that these In-
structions, even if able to be strictly enforced bfs
the accounting officers, will prove successful ta'
wholly preventing the occurrence of defaults; bufJ
it is hoped that they will tend to an earlier de-
tection of some of them, should any hereafter
happen
3 A few new provisions made by Coiigresa
would add much to their efficacy Thus, if a fur-
ther clerical force were authorized by law to bfe
placed in the F rst Auditor's Office, more season-
able and thorough examination of the bond ac-
counts would be practicable, and would, to all
appearance, prove beneficial in discovering-defal-
cations The same result would appaiently hap-
pen, also, ¡f the naval officer at such aportas
New York were enabled, under the increased
labor it would devolve on him, to employ such
additional clerks as may be necessary to ffefform
the duties required by law in examthing-critieally,
and certifying concerning all the payments at that
large port, as well as the assessment of duties 
So would it happen in the First Comptrollers
Office, if the necessary force were given by Con-
gress to investigate caiefully the balances on set-
tlement, whenever large, and when ti ose balances
arc, on buch an investigation, not satisfactorily
explained, if they should be required by law not
only to be immediately reported foi suit to the
solicitor, but the suspicious circumstances, and
even the amount considered due, be, in all cases,
communicated to the President, or the head of the
Department
But by none of these steps would the public, in
my opinion, be sufficienUy secured, without still
other legislation of a general character, most of
which has been explained in the last three reports
from this Department on the finances The pro-
vision in the act of 12 h October, 1837, allowing
the collector, instead of the district attorney, to
extend the payment of bonds falling due, removed
one important check which before existed, in re-
quiring the former to deliver forthwith all unpaid
bonds to the lattei for collection On this, as well
as other accounts, some new and some rigorous
provisions by Congress became still more indis-
pensable, and have been earnestly recommended
But, before considering them in detail, it may be
proper to observe that, in point of fact, only a
small part of íVtr Swartwout's defaults probably
originated subsequent to the suspension of specie
payments in May, 1837, and that, after the sus
pension, when drafts and Treasury notes consti-
tuted the principal receipts at New York, till he
left office, Mr Swartwout was still required to
make deposits in bank of a great part of any sup-
plus wnch he ever collected in money He was
rot one of the officers permitted to istain money
