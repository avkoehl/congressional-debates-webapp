HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 5, 1864-9 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding learned to-day, in passing over the rear line, that you would prepare that part of it connecting with your left from the point reached by the Ninth Corps about 1 or 2 o'clock to-day. This is desirable, as the Ninth Corps has the line as far as the Williams house to prepare, and it is considered important to complete the rear line quickly.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 5, 1864. (Received 9.30 p. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have made preparations to do what I can for the part of the line you mention in your dispatch. I will endeavor to have the work on it keep pace with my preparations elsewhere.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 5, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS:

I would respectfully recommend the naming of our forts and redoubts so that they can be designated in orders. For the large redoubt on the plank road I would propose Fort Davis, after Colonel P. Stearns Davis, who was killed near there while it was building. For the northern bastion fort on the Weldon railroad, Fort Dushane, after Colonel N. T. Dushane, who was killed near it on the 21st instant. For the southern bastion fort on the railroad, Fort Prescott, after Colonel George L. Prescott, who was killed in battle before Petersburg on the 18th of June.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 5, 1864-9 a. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:

The enemy are reported as still occupying the advanced line taken up in front of the Third Division and continuing the construction of their works. The enemy's vedettes advanced in front of the Second Division yesterday, and our scouts were fired upon; this morning they were gone again. Some traces of cavalry were observed on that part of the line.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
