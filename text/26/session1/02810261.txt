man until such time as Mr J  shall furnish them, when th*
whole will be published ]
The debate was here interrupted by Mr J W JONB3, who
called lor the orders of the day-
Mr GRAVES lose for the purpose of getting the consent of
the House, before pas ing to the ordeis, to permit him to reply
to the reference which had been made to him in the course of
the abofe debate
Mr CAMPBELL of South Carolina objected The gentle
man had not been referred to in any manner which rendered it
necessary for him to make an explanation
The question was then taken on the motion to pa«s to the or
ders, and agreed to—ayes 102, noesnot counted
Mr JENIFER inquired ol the Chair whether h* lost his
right to the floor for to morrow morning!
The CHAIK replied in the negative
The SPEAKER then announced that the business before the
House was the bill making appropriation to complete the re
moval of the raft of the Red river, and for other purposes, on
which was pending three motions, v z to refer, 1st, to the
Committee on Roads and Canals, 2d, to the Committee on Com-
merce, and 3d, to the Committee of Ways and Means, with
the following instructions, moved by the gentleman from Penn
sylvania, Mr Biddlb, to inquire and report to the House as
follows-
1 Whether the advance of money by the Bank of Arkansas,
which it b one of the objects of this tall to reimburse, was not
made with full knowledge t> at the agent of the United Slates
who effected the loan was acting in defiance of positive In
Mructions from his superiors, as well as in the lace of a known
refusal by Congress to appropriate money to the work
2. Whether the estimate on which the bill is founded was
not made by the said asent prior to the closing up ol the raft m
August last, and whether any satisfactory data exist for com
puung the probable cost ol removing the present impediments
to navigation
3   Whether the su m approprnted by this bill is called for In
the estimates accompanying the President's message
4   Whether the bi'l is not of such a character that it ought to
have originated in this House
The question being successively put on referring the bill to
the Committee on Roads and Canals, en Commerce, and of
Ways and Means, it was referred to the Committee of Ways
and Means                                                      .
The question then being on the instructions,
Mr H GARLAND demanded the yeas and nays on them,
which were or lered, and were—yeas 130, nays 37
So toe instructions were adopted
Various Senate bills lying on the Speakeh's table were taken
up, read twice, anil appropriately referred
INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL
The act to Qfovide for the collecting, sale keeping, and dts
b irsement af the public revenue, coming up on Hs reference, it
was read wrfce when
Mr J ft JONfcS moved to rsfer it to the Committee of
Ways ajfri Means and
Mr^HIl't of Kentucky moved to commit it to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
•     Upon this proposition, Mr W remarked he proposed to
JsMomit a few observations He said he would limit himself
Jjnainly to the isolated question ol reference—reserving whatever
Flie tniiht desire to say upon the general merits of the bill, wl en
* it should cotne up for discussion in the Committee of the
Whole    He asked what solid objection theie was to the propo
stuon of reference to the Committee ol the W hole upon the
■tate of the Umonl   He could  not perceive any    Is it pro
posed to take away fiom the Cunmijee of Ways and Means
any of its appropriate and ordinary (lutus 1   He did not so un
derstanil it    He was not disposed to innovate upon the esta
b'ishej order of business, or withhold from ihe Commiuee of
Ways and Means any matters or propositions that legitimately
belongs to that committee
Mr W remarked, that whilst he was ready to aid in seeur
ing to all the standing committees their )ust rights, he wis
not mcl ned quietly to sit| by and see the ent re business of the
nation swept into the arms of the standing cnmmi tees. Mr
W said it would be recollected that the principal standing
eo-mni tees were emphuicallv Executive Committees Ade
cided majority of the members of said committees selected,
because of the acknowledged approval of the great and leading
measures of the Admin stration Of this, he would not stop to
complain—perhaps it was right it should be so, but the exist-
ence off such a fact certainlyi authorized a rigid restriction of
sad committees to their proper an) legitimate duties Mr \\
said the very object and exclusive purpose of sanding comit
tees was to take chirgeof the usual and ordinary business of
this House He observed that, according to well settled par
liamentary practice and according to the uniform usage in le
gislation in this body, until within a veiy few years past, all
propositions ofanex'ranrlinary character, all matters of great
concernment, ti speak in parliamentary language, anda espc
cially a measure like the one now under consideration, involv
ing n t simply the revenues—the finances ol the Government,
but effecting for weal or woe, for good or evil, the currency,
commerce agriculture, manufactures, and every ramification
•f business of this entire country, peculiarly dema id to he re
ferred, debate 1, and matured in the Committee of the Whole
apon the state of ihe Union
But again, said Mr W if none of the reisons urged existed
in fdvor of his prop >sed reference of this bill, convenience and
expediency recommend the preference of his proposition It
is well known to every member of the House, that the standing
committees have quite as much business of the ordinary charac
ter as they are able to discharge, and especially the Committee
of Ways and Means, the regular duties of which are onerous
in theextreme Mr W a'ked if there wai any thing new or
unusual in the proposition he had made? He contended there
was not, so far from it, any other reference, he insisted, wou d
be a deparure from the established usage of this House, from
the beginning of the G >vemment to the opening of this Admt
mstratioi He s ud if the j mrnals of this House were ex
am:ned, it would be found ihat at two pel lods in the history of
th* country—if not in all respects similar, lertamly in very
many things similar to the present—the magnitude of the
crisis was considered so great, and the measures of redress so
weighty, that special committees were raised, as a matter of
course, without opposition, chosen from the first talents of the
House, to whom were referred the propositions of the nature
now proposed to be referred to the standing Committee of
Ways and Meant In the year 1791, when the finances tf this
Qovornment ttert greatly embAnaissoaVih, currency depre-
ciated—commerce suspended—public and private credit great-
ly depressed—this course was adopted In 1814-15, a crisis
very similar to the present, the same course was pursued
by this House in each successive year? And was it so
ordered at those periods, asked Mr Whitb, because of
any distrust ol the want ot intelligence or financial ability m
the members of the standing committees of those days'! No,
sir, go and read the names of the distinguished individuals who
compised the standing committees of Ways and Means at the
periods alluded to, and there is no circle of greatness that can
be drawn around the present chairman and «is associates upon
said committees, from which they could justly be excluded
He said this, not by way of invidious compirison, but to repu-
diate the idea that it would reflect any disparagement euher
upon the intelligence or integrity of the present Committee of
Ways and Means to make the reference proposed Mr W
saitl he did not controvert, that, at the called session of '37, the
topics now proposed to be referred to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, were referred to the standing
Committee ol Ways and Means, and that the precedent then
set had been followed since that period Yet, he contended,
Ihe precedent was a departure Irom the established usage of le
gnlation in this House, and nothing, in his judgment, but the
peculiar circumstances of the case, would have carried its
adoption
He said it would be recollected, no business of an ordinary
character was acted upon during that «e«sion, nothing but the
"grave and weishty matters," for which that extraordinary
Congress was Called, and so far from the fact that the Com-
mittee of Ways and Mean  having bad charge of the mat trs
contained in this bill at the called session, being an argument m
fivor of a similar reference now, to his mind it was a vital ob-
jection
The majority of that committee now now entertain the same
sentiments w ith the majority at the special se«sion, whore
portul upon the proprsmons contained in this bill The bill
now before the House is, in substance, the same bill reported
then 1 his bill (said Mr W)ind been manufactured by the
Committee of Finance in the Senate, peculiarly an Executive
Committee, hurried through that bod}, he would say
(if it would not eulject him to be called to order)
with unexampled haste, to effect purposes not of the
the most patriotic character /Why, then, he asked, go through
the i lie formality of referring this bill to the Commttee of Ways
and Mean1 , if immediate aition is intended upon it? Why
has the honorable chairman permuted it tt  «lumber upon
your table for six long weeks, without an effort even to call
it up—to have it referred or printed? Is it intimated that the
committee propose to make any alteration in said b 11?
croi>s a T, or dot an I? No such purpose is avowed Why,
then, this circuitous proposition, ol reference to the Commit
tee of Ways and Neans? If speedy action be the wi«h of
the friendo of this measure, why not let the bill go directly
to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
where it will be open to amendment and foi discus ion?
Were the friends of this measure wai ing for political contin
geucies? Were they waiting for a prosperous commercial re
vuNion? Were they waiting to shape the fea'uresof this bill
as poll ical expediency may dictate, some weeks or months
hence? Mr W slid he knew very we 1 all such ohjecu, or
intentions would be repudiated <snd scouted with a flourish of
trumpets, wi h a holy horror Bnt will not the count y Isok
to the actions of gentlemen, rather than their declarations?
Ate there any elections to take place in the couise of a few
weeks, Ihe result of which might rmke it advisable foi the
good of the country, and if not for the good of the country, for
the safety of the Administration, to lt,t this bill sleep in the
arms of the Committee of Ways an I Means the sleep of death?
or  if passed, passed with radical modifican n«?  J
If the fritnds of this mea«i re sincerely desire its passage,
why delay? why procrastma e? The Administration have an
undisputed naj irity in both Houses If this bill be the political
panacea tha us friends profess it is, in the name of high Ilea
ven why fe'av the remedy for one houil Is the patient not
sufficient y ifflicteií? Ismt thediseasi universal, commencing
here at the centre, paralyzing the t. ivemment revenues, ex
tending to eveiy branch of business, afTecting every class of
society, the merchant, manufacturer, mechanic, and farmer,
leaving not a gieen spot of proiperity upon the broad map of
this country, to rest the wearied eye from scenes ot distress and
suffering? If this bill be the grand specific, the infallible re-
medy, why not administer it at once? Hat ing the undisputed
powei to pass it forthwith, why keep a suffering people any
Ion *ei in a state of cruel suspense? Aie we not told by the
President, in his annual message, that the "continued azitation
of tins quemón injurious!} affects the businessof the country?"
Sir, (said Mr W ) if it is to pass let it pass, and pass quickly,
—with all i s blessings, if its advocates are right—with all its
m series, if its opponents are not deceived
But, Mr Speaker (said Mr W)Ipiomi«ed in the beginning
of my remirks not to go into tVe merits of this bill He
weiild redeem his promise, and conclude, with the hopethat the
proposition of reference, moved by him, would be sustained by
the Hou«e
Mr RHETT would merely call the attention of the House
fo the purposes for which the Committee of Ways and Means
was cjnstituted Mr R then read from the rules of the House
the following rule
"It shall he the duty of ihe Committee of Ways and Means to
take into consideration all reports of the Treasury Department,
and all such propositions relative to ihe revenue as may be re-
ferre I to tli-m by the House "
Nowthe gi nfleman had said very correctly that ihisstilject
was of great importance to the whole country This, though
true, was only so in reference to the manner in which the reve
nue shad be collected and disbursed—a subject which at all
times belonged to the Committee of Ways and Means In con
formity with this view, all bills affecting ilie revenue had come
from the Commitiee of Ways and M'ans So also in relation
te banks which haii the custody of the public revenue
Mr WHITE of Ksn'uckv said the eentleman was mistaken,
the last bi 11 for the charter of the Bank of the United States came
from the Senate
Mr R HI T r stood corrected The Bank charter of 1816 did,
he believed, come from the Comirntce of Ways and Means,
bti in this he might be nils aken— he was not particulir But
whether it was so or not, he submi'ted to ihe gentleman if ths
Committee of Ways and Means had not the subject m dercon
sideration When it came from th- Senate it was sent to the
Committee of Way  and Meant. Thii was not tha ease with
refjard. to this bill, fat th* Committee of Wtjj and Mhq« tw)
not yet had it under cousideratio . Wa  there any measure,
be would ask, af great importance, that was not referred either
to one of the standing committees, or to a select committee,
before it was acted on in Committee of the Whole? After this
bill should be examined by the Commiuee of Ways and Means,
it would, as a matter of eourse.be taken up and fully discussed
in Committee of the Whole This was ms desne, and he also
understood it to be the desire of the chairman of the Commute*
of Ways snd Means
Mr EVERETT would inquire of the chairman of th*
Committee of Ways and Means if there were appropriations in
this bill which would render it necessary that it should go to hit
committee
Mr JONES of Virginia considered that every bill of impor-
tance should be referred to its appropriate standing commute*
before acting on it in the House
Mr EVERETT said he wished to move instructions to the
committee to amend this bill so as to cure it of some ofits roost
material defects All the bills on this subject, reported since
1837, contain withm themselves provisions under which the
Sub Treasury might be converted into a bank of discount as
well as a bank of circulation The object, therefore, of his pro
posed instructions wai, to test this question at the outset, and
get the yeas and nays on it, which he feared he might not be able
t > do at a subsequent stage of the proceedings. Every bill which
had been reporltd on this subject gave the Treasury the power
to transfer the moneys of the Government from one place to
another, without pointing out the mode in which these transfers
shall be made It also gives the power to pay the pebts of the
Government witlnut pointing out how these debts shall be
paid All, then, that was necessary to convert this Sub Trea
sury into a bank of discount was simply to purchase a draft oa
New Orleans, receive the securities of ihe indivii'ual in payment,
and make thisdraft receivable in paymem of duties Then, in
order to make it a bank of circulation, all that was necessary
was that when a creditor of the Gevernment wanted his money
at a paiticular place, say at Philadelphia, pay him in ten dol-
lar drafts Mi E said lie could not imagine that this bill was
intended for the mere purpose of safe keeping the public re-
venue,for the Government had no money tokeep,and he could not,
therefore, conceive why the Admmis ration was so anxious for
this measure, unless for ulterior objects When there were no
banks in the country for the merchants, the calculation of the
Administration must be that the merchants must he dependent
for their facilities on the Government Then, (said Mi E )
when you have got a bank of discount and circulation, and
ex ended undei a set ol Government directors thioughout the
Spates of the Union, just look at the tremendous political power
it will possess, when you can say who shall ha> e loans and who
shall not, who can measure the extent of the power It would
he in vain, then, to struggle against it
Mr E m illustration of his argument, referred to the history
of aState bank in hisown State established, he said, in Demo
cratic times He wished to call the attention of the chairman
of the Committee of Waysand Means to this subject, and ask
him if such would not be ihe effect if the Government was per
muted to puichase drafts without any limitation It was for
the purpose of testing these questions that be submitted his mo-
tion of instructions Mr E then moved to instruct the com-
mittee to amend the bill by inserting the following provisions
"That whenever it shall he necesf ary to place moneys appro-
priated at the disposal of -my disbuising officer, it shall be the
duty oflhe Scrretaiy of ths Treasury to cause a Treasury war
rant to be issued, directing the Treasurer, or Receiver General,
or a Treasurer of the Mint, to placa the turn required to the
credi of such disbursing officer
"That whenever it shall be necessary to «antler money ft om
the Tieasurer, from a Receiver General, or Treasurer of the
Mint, to anothei Receiver Gener il or Treasurer, of the .Mint, or
from either to the Treasurer, in case it be inconvenient to make
such transfer in specie, itslnll be the duty of the Secretary of
the Treasury to cause transfer drafts tobe issued in sums not
¡.SB than one thousand dollars each, payable to the order of the
Treasurer, Receiver General, or Treasurer of a Mint to whom
the money is to be transferred, and to transmit the same to htm,
who shall cause the same to he sold tt his office after three
days'publ c notice, for cash m hand only, and on such sale he
shall endorse upon such diaft the day of such sal , the amount
for whicb it was sol , and the day on which it is made payable,
which shall be after ten days, and within ninety dajs from Us
day of date, provided the sale shall be made at a gt eater, die-
count than five per cent
' That all pay ments to the creditors of Ihe th* United States shall
be made at the Treasury, or under the directum of the Secreta-
ry of the Treasury, by drafts drawn upon aucir* Receiver Gene-
ral or Treasurer of one of said Mints, as the creditor shall de
sígnate, payable to the creditor at such day, after ten days and
within ninety days from date, and such drafts sljaJl be for the
entire sum found due and payable to such creditor, unless such
sum shall exceed two thousand dollars, in which case it shall
be lawfnl to issue several drafts, provided that to one of them
shall be for a less s1 m than one thousand dollars. And u* any
such trausfer draft or Treasury dratt shall not b  presented for
payment, at the office at which it is payable by the day specified
thereon for payment, the payment thereof shall be suspended
for three months from the day on which it shall be presented
And if any transfer or other ¿raft, presented for payment of
the day on which it was made pavahle, or at the expiration of
said three months, shall be protested for non payment, it shall
hetheduty of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the return of
such transfer draft or Tieasury draft, to cause the amount
thereof, with ten per centum for damages, to be paid to the
holder of suchtransfcr draft or Treasury dralt.
p ^"And that said committee be further instructed to inquire and
'report whether the bill is not of such a character that it eught
to have originated in this House "
Mr THOMPSON of South Carolina had been anxtous, dur-
ing the whole session, to know when thiaeubject would come
up fordiscussitn, in order that he might make some rt marks
in regard to it. lie was, therefore, decidedly in favor of_tnia
discussion coming up immediately, and the Committee oltne
Whole certainly was as competent as the Committee of_«■*■
and Means to consider the subject He could not but;"_°™"
