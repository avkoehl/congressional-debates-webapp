can send and get troops from Kansas. As soon as Mower's cavalry arrives I will send them by boat as far toward Lexington as possible. The railroad will [be] repaired to the La Mine bridge to-morrow, and, if that is not burned, all the way through to Warrensburg.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 10, 1864.

Major-General PLEASONTON:

You say Sanborn is on their left flank. If that is our left flank south of them, all right; if not, wrong. I don't consider Lexington worth our attention. Certainly not worth a soldier. What we want it to gain time while the enemy stays north of the railroad. Our troops ought to make Sedalia and Clinton while the cavalry harass them farther north.

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 10, 1864-7.15 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

General Sanborn reports the rebel train as empty. The plunder is carried by the men on their horses, and what goods they cannot carry off in this way they destroy. They are dropping a great many broken-down horses. He estimates their force at 15,000 mounted men and militia and nineteen pieces of artillery. Anderson's and Thornton's bushwhackers joined Price yesterday.

Major General A. PLEASONTON,

Jefferson City:

Direct General Brown to ascertain what rolling-stock there is west of the Moreau, and to report to me. Where are my citizen guards and their arms? Have every effort made to repair the railroad west. If the La Mine bridge is not destroyed save it if practicable.

Has Lieutenant Shubert started? If not, please hurry him through; there is no danger on the road. One hundred rebels passed west this morning, supposed to have dispatches for Price.
