WM. D. GREEN,

Lieutenant-Cavalry and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAINT LOUIS,Saint Louis, July 3, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BURRIS,

Commanding, Cape Girardeau:

You should keep at New Madrid the companies of cavalry recently sent there from Cape Girardeau, and the guerrilla bands must be driven out and kept out of that region. For this purpose the most of the cavalry now at Cape Girardeau will be sent there if necessary.

I do not like the idea of employing Carpenter, whom I sent to you, on his won statement that you agreed to employ him. I suspect he is another Truman. If you employ the two fellows watch them carefully.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

NEW MADRID, July 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I did not employ Carpenter until he said that you had sent him tome. The cavalry from Cape Girardeau arrived here to-day. I have a scout party from here to-day; shall have another to-morrow, and the next day will move with all the troops that can be spared into Pemiscot County, and perhaps into Arkansas. I think Kitchen is below here with considerable force.

JOHN T. BURRIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
