I sent yesterday an expedition of FIFTY men-the Seventh Tennessee Cavalry-under Lieutenant Helmer, in the direction of Hickman, Ky. ; succeeded in capturing 2 men of the rebel Major Tate's command, and returned in the evening. Two citizens, named, respectively, W. H. simmons and James Lee, twice endeavored to pass pickets yesterday with a large amount of money, consisting of legal-tender notes, Tennessee bank notes, and gold, without proper passes and permits for their horses and baggage. I have ordered their arrest. Please instruct as to their disposal.

Very respectfully,
