NATAL JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL.
Mr. GRIMES. I move to take up Senate bill
No. 465.. It is a little bill of only one section,
creating a law officer in the Navy Department.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S. No.
465) to create the office of Solicitor and Naval
Judge Advocate General was considered as in
Committee of the Whole. It proposes to author-
ize the President to appoint, by aryl with the ad-
vice and consent of the Senate, an officer in the
Navy Department, to be called the Solicitor and
Naval Judge Advocate General, at an annual sal-
ary of $4,000.
The bill was reported to the Senate. ';
Mr. TRUMBULL. I have been trying, this
whole session to get reports from the vaiious
heads of Departments stating how much motoey
has been paid for counsel and attorney fees by tjie
different Departments. We have had responses
to the resolution of inquiry from all the heads oI
Departments but the Attorney General, and those
reports have been ordered to be printed. We have
established as one Department of the Government
the office of Attorney Genera], and we have dis-
trict attorneys all over the United States paid by
the Government; and yet nearly every Depart-
ment of the Government is now having its sepa-
rate attorneys to attend to the business of the
particular Department. If this practice is to go
on, 1 think we had better abolish the Attorney
General's office. They have Solicitors and Assist-
ant Solicitors in the Treasury Department. My
friend from Massachusetts [Mr. Wilson] at the
last Congress got through a bill for a Solicitor in
the War Department, and they have also in that
Department a Judge Advocate General, and I do
not know how many attorneys. Now the Naval
Committee come in and want an Attorney Gen-
eral's office for the Navy Department practically,
but [ believe they call him a judge Advocate Gen-
eral. I suppose his duties will be to attend to
courts-martial, and to prize cases, and to advise
the Secretary of the Navy generally, and I sup-
pose that instead of the Navy Department call-
ing on the Attorney General for the construction
of the laws which ought to be settled by him for
all the Departments of the Government, this coun-
sel of the Secretary of the Navy will lay down
the law for that Department, and the counsel of
the Secretary of War will lay it down for that
Department, and so on.
Really, I do not think there is any necessity for
the creation of such an office. So far as general
legal questions are concerned, they ought to be
referred to the Attorney General, and his decis-
ion should be binding upon all the Departments.
So far as courts-martials are concerned, let them
detail some officer toactas judge advocate, as has
been the practice heretofore, and will have to be
after this office is created, as my friend from New
Hampshire [Mr. Hale] suggests. I think we
have gone far enough in creating these different
law offices in the separate Departments of the
Government.
Mr. GRIMES. This is a matter in which I
have no greater interest than the Senator from
Illinois or any other member of this body. The
bill was sent to the Committee on Naval Affairs
by the Secretary of the Navy, with a letter ac-
companying it, which I send to the desk to be
read. 1 will state m this connection that it is
utterly impossible for the Attorney General to
attend to the legal business that i  required to
be attended to by the Navy Department. The
only result of the defeat of the bill will be that
the Navy Department will be obliged to employ
counsel occasionally instead of having a regular
counsel whose merits and qualifications we pass
upon when we confirm him as Solicitor.
The Secretary read the following letter:
Navy Department,
Washington, February 20, 1665.
Sir: Mnny,rmdsompof them vory Important, legal ques-
tions and suits, growing out ot the transactions of tin* De-
partment, are constantly arising. Some of them involve
large pecuniary amounts and frequently embrace great
variety of det;nh *The eases of court-martial are numer-
ous, and require scrutiny and careful preparation and re-
vision. The forms and execution of contracts undf.r the
provisions of lw demand deliberate and attentive c.ire and
consideration. Frauds and alm^es on the part of con-
tractors and employes call for investigation and prosecu-
tion, and the miscellaneous legal questions which ari&e are
innumerable, involving often a vast extent and variety uf
detail.
For these important duties the Department has no law
officer. I would, therefore, respectfully that the
interest of the Government would be greatly promoted were
Congress to create the office of" Solicitor and Naval Judge
Advocate General," to be attached to this Department. The
officer to fill this position should be selected by the Presi-
dent, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
whose duty it shall be to attend to the matters herein in-
dicated, and to any special duties that may be a&signed to
htm by the Secietary of the Navy.
Very respectfully, GIDEON WELLES,
Secretary of the Navy,
Hon. J. W. Grimes,
Chairman Naval Committee United States Senate,
Mr. TRUMBULL. I had no doubt that the
Secretary of the Navy was in favor of having an
Attorney General's office under liis control. It is
very convenient to have solicitors for each head
of a Department, to throw upon them the respon-
sibility >of construing the laws; and I suppose
each hnreau will want one by and by if this prac-
tice is to go on. Here it is proposed to create the
office of Solicitor for the Navy Department, at a
salary of $4,000. I think the creation of such an
office is entirely unnecessary, but I do not mean
to-take up the time of the Senate in discussing it.
I have called attention to it. I do not believe it
Is in harmony with the organization of our sys-
tem of Government to have an Attorney General's
officeโfor that is what it amounts toโin each
Department of the Government. If that is to be
done I think wc might as well abolish the Attor-
ney General's Department which we have.
I know that counsel are being employed all
over the United States by these different Depart-
ments. 1 tried at the last session of Congress to
secure the adoption, and I supposed Congress
had adopted, the suggestion and put a limit upon
the fees that were to be paid to district attorneys
of the United States. We pa^ed a law making
the maximum sum that any attorney should re-
ceive $6,000, but it seems that three days after-
ward we passed a law allowing them a percent-
age, as I am now informed by a letter in my
possession, received within a day or two from the
Secretary of the Interior. Ho states in the letter
that the amount of money appropriated in the
proper bill by the House of Representatives for
the judiciary fund is $500,000, and in this letter
he asks that $200,000 be added to that appropria-
tion, so as to make it $700,000; and why? I do
not know but that it would be as well in this con-
nection to have his letter read. He says that the
money which is paid to district attorneys and
special counsel in prize cases is so large that it
will require next year $200,000 more than it has
been usual to appropriate for the judiciary fund.
I think it is about tune we stopped this practice."
1 will read a few sentences from the letter of the
Secretary of the Interior:
" In ttiis eonneetion the attention of the Committees of'
Ways rsii-l Means and on the Judiciary is respectfully invited
to the provisions of the fourteenth, twenty-third, and
twenty-fourth sections of the act to regulate prize proceed-
ings and the distribution of prize money, and for other pur-
poses, approved June 3'), 1834, (Acts of the first session of
the Thirty-Eighth Congress, page 306,}

ings a charge upon and piyaide out of that fund. The
