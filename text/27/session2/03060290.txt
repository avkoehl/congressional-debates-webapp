sUspc^on ^ouid be merely temporary, that it would last but
a fW^Whs,aa,iUhatas soon as those banks, which they de-
clared had úw$%$&m  o*o suspension, acting in good faith
towards tftv f ^$3pG£Hd resume, they would resume Every
Senator njast b* a <¡favf tbBse idCts- aR<* now th* question is,
why did they b **. f~m£ their promises, and resume at the period
fixed The ag&w«r will be found in the legislation uf the
country* At tfea special session of Congress, which was called
a few months aíct-r the bank suspensions, it was found that if
not a majority, there was at least a laige proportion of the
two ¡louses ready to stand up and justify the bants, and not
only this, but they weie ready to seize upon the nation's trea
sury, ana tmiisfer its contents to the coffers of the banks, and
by that traitorous act they had reduced the Government to the
utmost ex.remiiy, paralyzed its energies, and produced a so
lerhn pause throughout its whole machinery, and although, by
the instrumentality of the banks, this universal evil had been
effected, this total destruction of the currency, yet men were
found here, able and powerful, to rise m their places, with the
knowledge of all these facts, and propose to give to these veiy
banks the whole revenues of this Republic—to seize upon
upon the public treasury—a thing never done un^ei any ether
Government under Heaven, except it were done by a foreign
enemy—an armed enemy, and having seized upon it, there
were found those who were baseenough tojustify the act—an
act for which every tiaitor among' them deserved to be exe
en reí, and such would have been their ignominious fate had
they lived m the days of the Roman Republic, where patriots
wjre to be found bold enough to denounce such traitors of in
suited freedom He maintained that it was an act of a trea-
sonable nature, and vet, stiange to relate, that act had found
justification on that floor
Wh n these banking institutions found that it was possible *o
coii'nl and enfoice the legislation of the country, then H wis  ¡
they went sedulously to work and obtained such laws as **e\ ved ,
to assist them, to the full extent of their wishes, in the woik oí
plunder    This was the State of the case, and  they weic now
asked, after five years had been suffered to pass, after then
fiauduLnt operations had been tolerated for all this length oí  j
time, after these banks had, openly and shamefully revolted
againstaiilaw^nd defied the power ofthemsulted commumiy,
overwhelming and crushing and destroying the industry and the
prosperity of the country—after allihis, and With this admission
on every one's tongue that the^e continued suspensions are the
great cahmity under which the nation is groaning, they were
again called upon to confirm to these banks the power of sus
pension m the face of the law, which requires that they shall re
sume, for the act in reality enables the banks to suspend, to all
practical intents    It was admitted by the Senator on the other
s de, that they had none of their specie paying papei ou , ?nd
why was this* because, by i-ssuuy, not their own notes, but tne
notes of the suspended banks m the adjoining States, they were '
enabled effectually to avoid the piovjsions of the law, which im
poses upon them the necessity of redeeming their noteb in '■pe-
cíe, having no notes of their own in circulation, and consequently
being freed from the obligation of redeeming any
This little Di&tnet had always been held up, and he believed,
too truly, as a place within which crime might be peipmiied
with impunity, that it was almost beyond the reach of the laws
of this Government
When important measures were pending befoie the Senate,
they were told that the action of that body possessed a power-
ful influence abroad through ut the country—that the example
sat by them was regarded a> worthy of imitation in all inferior
Legislature*, let them then, by their action on this subject, °us
tam that high character, let them furnish now an example
worthy of i mtatioi While their constituents, at home, were
coercing then local LogisUtuieb to take measures for foicing
the banks into resumption, should they deliberately violate
what they knew to be the public will, by authorizing a continu
anee, on the part of the banks, m that course which was "o uni-
versally reprobated throughout the whole country But the
Senator, m support of his argument, said there was compaia
lively no business done m this District, that there was no v>oik
done he pi, that nothing waa produced, well, then, what use had
they for banks at all? Taking the view advanced by the Sent
tor himself, banks were not necessary if no business was
transacted within the Distnct, if the debating m the two
Houses of Congress, and the writing m the publ c depaitmcnts
constituted the whole of the--------•
Mr BAYARD begged the honorable Senator would allow
him to state the argument which he had used He had said,
not that there waa no business done heie, but that theie was ho
productive industry which wou'd enable the District to meet
the accumulated debt incurred for the necessary articles of con-
sumption, and that the inhabit «its weie obliged necessanly, as
a Día  ict of consumers, to have recourse to the banks for tem-
porary supplies
Mr   ALLfN    Well, after all, the argument amounts only
to this, that the less business ihere is done, the more u-e there
is lor Dinks, and, by the same rule of reasoning,   there  is
more   necessity for banks   upon   the summit of the  Rocky
Mountain*, than m the rityof New Yoik    Sir, continue t Mr

The object of the present bill was to extenJthe duraticn of
the proviso contained in the act of 1841—-thdt statutory proviso
which the wisdom of Congress—ay, the wisdom—the Senator
used the word wisdom in connection with banking legislation
—wisdom—and now the same wisdom, acting on the criterion
of us o?*n íormei acts, is again to extend this proviso But
let us try the wiadom of Congress by another standard "When
it limited the proviso to the first of March, because the wis-
¿om of Congress saw that theie was a necessity for allowing
some ume in order to get nd of the notes of other banks then

annul their former wisdom, which declated that there
should be a limitation of the time allowed to the banks forthia

Gentlemen would, no doubt, proceed in all honesty and since-

had so lorg habituated themselves to contemplate bank suspen-

from them a different course
