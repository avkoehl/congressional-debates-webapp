on Bowling Green road. Haupt is at Falmouth with his force, ready to spring with the railroad bridge when ordered. Affairs seem to justify it now here. Am sending 200 prisoners to the rear; 1 colonel. While I do not know who could replace me here, I am heartsick at not being permitted to be on the actual field, to share the fate and fortune of this army and my general.

BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 3, 1863-1.30 p.m.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,President of the United States:

From all reports yet collected, the battle has been most fierce and terrible. Loss heavy on both sides. General Hooker slightly, but not severely, wounded. He has preferred thus far that nothing should be reported, and does not know of this, but I cannot refrain from saying this much to you. You may expect his dispatch in a few hours, which will give the result.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
