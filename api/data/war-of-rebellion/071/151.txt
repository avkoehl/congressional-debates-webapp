HARRISBURG, PA., July 9, 1864.

Major T. M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have no reason to believe that a regiment will be organized in this State batteries two days to come. I yesterday asked the Secretary to have batteries mustered in by companies. No reply. The same authority should be given as regards cavalry, as the latter can only be used as scouts, and not many are needed or perhaps can be recruited.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, July 9, 1864.

Major-General COUCH,

Commanding, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Your telegram this date, relative to musters of artillery and cavalry by companies, received. The cavalry can be mustered by companies and this authority thereof. If yu have the cannon, this is authority to muster the artillery by companies. If not, it can only be received as infantry, there being no cannon here than can be sent you.

By order:

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

July 9, 1864.

Major-General COUCH,

Commanding, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Your telegram* of to-day, transmitting extracts from reply of Governor, relative to changing manner of mustering 100 days' men, received. In reply the Secretary of War directs me to say that if the term of service be reckoned from the date of regimental organization, as stated in your telegram to be proposed by Governor Curtin, the principal objection to mustering in by companies will be obviated. You may therefore adopt, in conjunction with the Governor, the modification he suggests; having, however, the explicit statement in writing that the term of service is to be reckoned from the date of regimental organization and not from the date of company muster, so as to avoid all misunderstanding with the troops.

Please inform me should this plan be adopted.

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

ADJUTANT-GENERAL PENNSYLVANIA,
