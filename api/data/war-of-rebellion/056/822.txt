of the employes of the factories there, and under the command of Captain J. R. King, a very fine officer. He has instructions to come to our aid under circumstances as fully explained in his orders. He will advise me from that direction by courier with written dispatches. The commandant of the posts at Marietta has promised to advise me fully from his direction. By request, General Iverson has kindly promised to advise me from his section by mail and telegraph. I have instructed Captain Steadman, commanding company of my command at Lawrenceville, to keep me posted from that direction. I have sent a detachment of one of my cavalry companies here on the Peach Tree Road, running between Roswell and Lawrenceville to Gainesville, to picket that road, thus as far as possible covering the front (toward enemy) with the best system of pickets I can avail myself of. I am having guns mounted at the batteries as fast as possible. As before remarked, the local troops are chiefly mechanics, and I cannot call them out and put them in camp without great injury to the service, unless it be in an emergency. If duly advised, they can be easily commanded. They are all armed, and I have had ammunition,&amp;c., all distributed to be ready at a moment's warning. I trust that I may be advised of the approach of any raiding parties so as to be ready, and hope that more men can be sent me if danger is threatened. If you say so, I can command 100 men from Macon, a splendid company, but unless the danger is apparent, would not like to call for them. Will you please reply by telegraph if necessary.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-If cavalry cannot be sent, please send infantry.
