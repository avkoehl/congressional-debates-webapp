enemy was so precipitate and my men and horses so much exhausted that I found it impracticable to proceed farther without rest.

About daylight Captain David, of the Fifth Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, with 75 men and two small pieces, came up, and we again started in pursuit, following with all possible speed toward Germantown, when, finding it impossible to overtake him with my horses, worn down as they were by severe marching for about a week previous, I ordered Colonel Marvin, with his Enrolled Missouri Militia, to pursue them,a nd from whom I have not yet heard.

Your obedient servant,

NOVEMBER 5, 1862.- Action at Lamar, Mo.

Report of Captain Martin Breeden, Eighth Missouri Cavalry (Militia).

LAMAR, MO., November 6, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report that I was attacked last night by a band of rebels, numbering some 200 or 300.* I fought them some two and a half hours from houses and every way. The rebels rushed in and burned about one-third of the town. They killed 3 of my men and wounded 3 mortally, I think. We held the town and still hold it. We killed 5 or 6 of the rebels. I shall stay here until I hear from you. We would like to have some more men in this part of the country. Three squads have passed through this country within the past week, numbering in all about 1,000. They are all going south. If I had 150 more men here I think I could capture the squads that are passing through this country. I am not strong enough to organize the militia in Jasper County.

Yours, with respect,

M. BREEDEN,

Captain.

Colonel ORME.
