The road traveled was a bridle-path for sixty miles. My men and horses suffered very much on the mountains for rations. I lost only one man; he was captured.

My thanks are due to Captain McFarlane, commanding thirty-fourth Battalion Virginia Cavalry, also to capts. P. J. and W. D. Thurmond and W. H. Payne, all of whom did their whole duty. Cadet Buffington behaved in a very gallant and soldiery manner during the raid.

I would most respectfully call the attention of the general commanding to the gallant and meritorious conduct of Lieutenant J. W. Branham, aide-de-camp; also to Adjutant Wada, thirty-fourth Battalion Virginia Cavalry, both of whom were at all times at their posts.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

V. A. WITCHER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
