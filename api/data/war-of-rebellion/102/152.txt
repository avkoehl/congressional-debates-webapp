HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 21, 1865.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas, Little Rock, Ark.:

GENERAL: In relation to Captain Wheeler's notes on routes from Arkansas to Red River I have the observe:

First. Captain Wheeler states nothing whatever concerning cross-roads-a knowledge of which is necessary for purpose of communication, and if necessary of concentration of columns moving on the different routes, also to enable us to send wagons as fast as emptied toward the west, where they can get into a grazing country. It is, besides, essential to know of these cross-roads, because I do not propose to go as far south as some points laid down in these notes. For instance, I know that there are roads leading west at least twenty miles north of Washington. Doubtless there are many others of which we ought to know. I am not sure but that the main body of our forces may march from Dardenelle or Fort Smith instead of Little Rock, so as to keep in the grazing region as far as possible. Certainly all of our trains not absolutely needed will be sent that way.

Second. Nothing whatever is said of the resources of the country, south of the line marked on the map you sent as "the line of no forage. " All information which can be obtained concerning this matter is needed.

Third. I do not know whether you have an organized pioneer corps for your command. There should be at least one pioneer corps for each division, completely equipped, and to consist, I suggest, each of 150 picked white men and three companies of negroes.

Fourth. I do not know weather you have a pontoon train. If you have I would like to know what sort of a train it is.

Fifth. I should like to know the prospective condition of the Arkansas from present indications, and how navigation of the river to Fort Smith can be hoped for.

Sixth. I would like to know as nearly as possible the width and exact character of the Red River, at Fort Townson, and for sixty miles below.

I send you an estimate of the trains I think of taking, setting forth the supplies I propose to carry. * Of course the estimate is more or less
