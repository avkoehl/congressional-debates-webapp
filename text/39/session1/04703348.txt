out affixing the stamp or stamps herein required, but
shall affix the proper stamp or stamps, as aforesaid,
upon such liquor when sold or removed from such
warehouse or other place of storage: And provided
further, That where fermented liquor has become
sour or damaged, so as to be incapable of use as such,
brewers may sell the same for manufacturing pur-
poses, and may remove the same to places where it
may be used for such purposes, in casks or other
vessels, unlike those ordinarily used for fermented
liquors, containing respectively not less than one bar-
rel each, and having the nature of their contents
branded upon them, without affixing thereon the
stamp or stamps herein required.
The Committee on Finance proposed to
amend this section by inserting after the word
"storage," in line forty-two, the following:
But when the manufacturer of any ale or porter
manufactures the same in one collcction district, and
owns, occupies, or hires a depot or warehouse for the
storage and sale of such ale or porter in another col-
lection district, he may, without affixing the stamps
on the casks at the brewery, as herein provided for,
remove or transport, or cause to be removed or trans-
ported, said ale and porter, in quantities not less
than one hundieu barrels at a time, under a permit
from the collector of the district wherein said ale or
porter is manufactured, to said depot or warehouse,
but to no other place, under such rules and regula-
tions as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may
prescribe or deem necessary; andthereafterthe man-
ufacturer of the ale and porter so removed shall
stamp the same when it leaves such depot or ware-
house, in the same manner and under the same pen-
alties and liabilities as when stamped at the brewery,
as heroin provided; and the collector of the district
in which such depot or warehouse is situated shall
furnish the manufacturer with the stamps for stamp-
ing the same, as if the said ale and porter had been
manufactured in his district.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. I move to amend the
amendment, in lines forty-nine, fifty-five, and
