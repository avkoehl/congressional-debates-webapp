tion and private entry, which ought justly and
properly to be confirmed, under its provisions.
To avoid this evil, I recommended to the appro-
priate committees of Congress, at the last session,
an extension of said law for a year; which rec-
ommendation was approved, and led to the pas-
sage^ the act of 17th July, 1848, extending the
provisions of the act of the 3d of Aflgust, 1846, to
■ the 3d of August, 1849; within which period, it is
believed, all the cases in which the claimants are
equitably entitled to relief, will be disposed of.
In ray last annual report, I stated all the cases
which had been examined and confirmed up to
that date. Since then, the following additional
casps have been adjudicated favorably to the
( claimants, to wit:
In Mississippi— Jlcres.
5 preemption entries, embracing about  560
In Louisiana—
32 preemption entries do  4,160
9 back concession and private entries, embracing
about  1,920

In Indiana—
1 preemption entry <da  ' 80
Total confirmed,807 preemption and private entries,
embracing 79,200
Rejected 2 entries, in part, in Wisconsin  160
As soon as the remaining cases shall have been
adjudicated by the board, a full report will be made
to Congress of the whole number of entries con-
firmed and rejected by the board, under the pro-
visions of the acts aforesaid, in conformity with
the second and third sections of the first recited act,
of August 3d, 1846.
In the mean time, patents will be issued to the
claimants as heretofore, as fast as the confirmations
are made, and the several cases are thereby re-
leased from suspension.

to the 30th September, 1848, is 375.
5. The number of patents engrossed, recorded,
and transmitted, on locations made with Mexican

Making the total number of patents engrossed,
recorded, and transmitted to the patentees, by the
General Land Office, during the calendar year 1847,
and first, second, and third quarters of the year
1848, 141,756.
1. The number of copies, or exemplifications of
cash-system patents, furnished to applicants, du-
ring the year 1847, and for the first, second^ and

256.
Making the total number of copies of patents

for the first, second, and third quarters of the year
1848, 1,413. ~
Unremitted attention has been given to this im-
portant branch of the operations of this office, with
the view of bringing up all the patents, of the
various classes mentioned, to the latest practicable
date; and much credit is due to the gentlemen in-
trusted with this service, for the extraordinary
number, as compared with former years, which
have been written and transmitted for the last, and
first three-quarters of the present year.
Great labor and particularity are often necessary,
in preparing the forms of the patents for the pri-
vate land claim and Indian reservation cases, and
much time is consumed in writing them, after the
forms are made out and corrected—it being not
unfrequently the case, that the writing of a single
patent will require the constant employment of a
good clerk for a whole day. The Virginia mili-
tary patents also require much time in writing
them, on account of the numerous courses and dis-
tances in many of the surveys, and much care is
necessary, to avoid mistakes, which might render
them valueless in the hands of the patentees,lifter
they are written.
To avoid all possible errors, however, as far
as may be practicable, all the patents, of every
description, are rigidly examined and compared
with the certificates of purchase, certificates of lo-
cation, or other data upon which they are predi-
cated, by boards of competent examiners, before
they gtre given out to the patentees, or transmitted
to the local land offices for delivery.
IX.—Bounty Land Districts in the State of
Ohio—Bounty Land Scrip, &c.
I mentioned in my last annual report, that there
were three military districts in the State of Ohio,
to wit: 1st. The United States Military District;
2d. The Canadian and Nova Scotia Refugee Dis-
trict; and 3d. The Virginia Military District.
These districts were originally carved out of the
"Northwestern Territory," and set apart and re-
served by the United States and the State of Vir-
ginia, for the satisfaction of claims to " bounty
lands," for services rendered during the revolu-
tionary war.
1. The United States Military District contained
originally 2,514,867.58 acres, and was set apart
to satisfy the claims of such officers and soldiers
only as Jiad served on continental establishment
during the war. Of this quantity, 1,301,326.38
acres were located wfth bounty-land warrants, and
127,626.50 acrps appropriated for common schools
in the district, and otherwise granted to persons
properly entitled thereto—leaving 1,085,914.70
acres unlocated, prior to the 3d of July, 1832.
The unlocated portions of this district were re-
stored to the mass of the public domain, and made
subject to private entry, as other public lands, by
the act of July 3d, 1832, of which there have been
sold, up to December 31st, 1847, 1,069,204.56
acres, leaving still a vacant remnant of 16,710.14
acres subject to sale at "private entiy." The same
act provided for the satisfaction of all the outstand-
ing unlocated claims upon this district, in a species
of scrip, usually called " revolutionary military
land scrip," whj,ch was made receivable in the
entry and payment of other public lands, for the
number of acres expressed upon the face of the
scrip.
The time for issuing warrants for these unsatis-
fied claims was extended, by the act of July 13th,
1832, to the 1st January, 1835; and by the act of
January 27th, 1835, to the 1st day of January,
1842.
The act of 27th January, 1835, was subsequently
revived, and continued in force, by the act of July
27th, 1842, for the term of five years, from and
after the date of the last-mentioned act.
The time for issuing this class of warrants ex-
pired on the 27th July, 1847. The second section
of the last-recited act provided, that all cases
which were not finally disposed of within the time
thus limited, should be, therefore, forever barred
from the benefit of all claim to bounty land, for
services performed, within the spirit and meaning
of the foregoing recited acts.
The two acts of January 27th, 1835, have been
again revived, by the act of the 26th June, 1848,
and continued in force for five years from the pas-
sage of said act—by which the time for issuing
this class of warrants has been extended to June
26th, 1853.
2. %Che Canadian and Nova Scotia Refugee Land
District—By the act of February 18th, 1801, frac-
tional townships of the l6th,-17th, 18th, 19th,
20th, 21st, and 22d ranges of townships adjoining
the southern boundary of the first-mentioned dis-
trict, containing 97,930.17 acres, were ordered to
be subdivided into half sections of three hundred
and twenty acres each, and set apart to satisfy the
grants made to the refugees from the British prov-
inces of Canada and Nova Scotia, of which
53,462^acres were located with Canadian warrants;
leaving 44,468.17 acres unlocated pridr to the 29th
of April, 1816.
The unlocated portions of this district wer% re-
attached to the public domain, and made a part of
the Chilicothe land district, by the act of Congress
of April 29th, 1816; and having been shortly after-
wards proclaimed for sale at public auction, sub-
sequently became subject to sale at "private
entry," as other public lands; since when, and up
to 31st December, 1847, 43,386.17 acres have been
sold; leaving a small remnant of 1,082 acres, still
vacant and unsold.
3. The Virginia Military District lies between
the Scioto and Little Miami rivers, and contained
originally upwards of 4,000,000 of acres. This
district was reserved by the State of Virginia, in
her deed of cession of 1784, for the purpose of
satisfying the "bounty land" claims of her own
officers and soldiers on continental establishment,
for services rendered during the revolutionary war.
The good lands in this district have been long
since absorbed by the locations of the more early
claimants, and a large number of warrants of this
class appear still to be unsatisfied. The quantity
of land still remaining vacant in this district is
estimated at about 175,000 acres, the greater part
of which is represented to be of very inferior qual-
ity, and much of it as entirely" unfit for cultivation.
The first act passed by Congress, on the 30th
May, 1830, for the relief of the officers and soldiers
of the Virginia State line, and the navy of the Rev-
olution, provided for a relinquishment of their
claims to bounties in lands, and for the issuing of
certificates of scrip, in satisfaction of them, for cer-
tain nominal sums equal to the minimum price of
the public lands, for such number of acresas the
claimants were entitled to. These certificates of
scrip were made "receivable in payment for any
lands subject to sale at "private entry," in the
States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; the time of
issuing them limited to the 1st January, 1835, and
the quantity of land thus to be located restricted
to 260,000 acres.
By the 7th section of the same act, the like piy-
vision was made foi; the unsatisfied warrants of
the Virginia line of troops, on continental establish-
ment, and the quantity of land limited to 50,000
acres, which was in addition to the 260,000 acres,
authorized to be located for the benefit of her State
Htie troops and navy, by the fifth section of the act.
This amount of scrip having proved to he insuffi-
cient for the satisfaction of these classes of war-
rants, another act was passed on the 13th July,
1832, authorizing an additional issue of scrip for
300,000, embracing as well the Virgirffa line of
troops on continental establishment, as her State
line and navy, so far as the warrants of either
remained unsatisfied.
This last mentioned appropriation being also
exhausted, another act was passed on the 2d of
March, 1833, providing for Me issue of an addi-
tional amount of scrip, for 200,000acres of land,
for the same uses, with the additional privilege,
that this class of scrip should be receivable in pay-
ment for any of the public lands subject to private
entry, without restriction as to the State or Terri-
tory in which they might be situated.
A large number of these warrants being still
unsatisfied, Congress again, by the second section
of the act of 3d of March, 1835, making " appro-
priations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of
the Government for the year 1835," authorized a
further issue of scrip for 650,000 acres of land, in
| addition to the amounts heretofore appropriated by
i the acts of 1830, 1832, and 1833, with the provis-
