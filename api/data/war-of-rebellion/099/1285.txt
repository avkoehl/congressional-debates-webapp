HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CORPS,In the Field, February 27, 1865.

Colonel J. M. OTEY, Asst. Adjt. General, Charlotte, N. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to make, for the information of General Johnston, the following statement, with reference to the organization, &amp;c., of Lee's corps: When moving from Tupelo, Miss., to Augusta, Ga., Lee's corps, then in hand and in good condition, with about 5,500 muskets, received orders for and made the following changes in its organization, viz: Sharp's and Brantly's brigades, of Johnston's division, were furloughed by organizations and left in that department; Holtclaw's brigades, of Clayton's division, were transferred with Jackson's and Baker's brigades, the former present with less than 100 muskets; the latter not joined, supposed to be with General Cheatham's column. Comming's brigade, Steventon's division, detached at Orangeburg, S. C., to re-enforce General McLaws, under promise from General Hardee that it should be sent by rail to Columbia, is now with General Hardee. Fifty-fourth Virginia, Palmer's brigade, Stevenson's division, Forty-second Georgia, Stovall's brigade, Clayton's division, were detached at Rienzi, Miss., as a guard to wagon train to Columbus, Miss. ; was ordered thence by water and rail to Augusta; is believed to be with General Cheatham. The artillery of the corps was concentrated at Columbus, Miss., and ordered to move the wheels by water and rail to Augusta, the horses overland. Johnston's battalion, Stevenson's division, were at Macon, Ga., on the 5th instant. The wagon train of the corps and horses of the field officers were ordered from Tupelo, via West Point and Macon, to Augusta, Ga. ; were forty miles north of Selma when last heard from.
