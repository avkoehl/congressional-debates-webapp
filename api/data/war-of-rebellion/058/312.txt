General J. G. FOSTER:

Your two dispatches of 31st ultimo received. The bridge matters will be attended to. I will assist you all I can in your operation against Longstreet, but it will be necessary for you to give me timely notice of what you need, as it will be necessary to draw some of Sherman's forces here, to move on Dalton simultaneously with your advance. We must act in concert.

KNOXVILLE, February 2, 1864.

Major General G. GRANGER:

You will have to depend upon your own resources. General Foster does not understand why you call on him for supplies at Campbell's Station. I could give no reason, as I knew nothing of the move.
