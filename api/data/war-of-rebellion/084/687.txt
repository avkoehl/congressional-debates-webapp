Major JOHN COSGROVE,

Lebanon:

Captain Quinn has not yet got in from Bolivar. I expect he has gone to Stockton, Millville, &amp;c. As soon as he comes back I will send him to Lebanon. Keep Captain Rubey's company there and issue clothing and supplies to them the same as if mustered in. There is a rumor here that there was some fighting at Hartville Thursday night. Have you heard anything of it?
