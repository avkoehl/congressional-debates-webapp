Ewell's corps and Breckinridge's division, all commanded by Early, are on the Maryland side os the river. The body of them reached Frederick last night. The movements of the enemy this morning indicate a movement on the Frederick and Baltimore pike. I hear nothing from General Hunter or this forces. There is no enemy on the Virginia side of the river between this place and Hancock. I have taken a few prisoners. I found that the transportation that was here is nearly all gone.
