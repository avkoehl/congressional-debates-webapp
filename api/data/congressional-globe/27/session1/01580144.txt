Twenty-seven millions of dolíais ih more than thib Govern

Flerida war shall have been, terminated, and its expenses paid,
this sum will more than meet our ordinal y expenditures And
Wiil taxes, such as those proposed, be a burdensome mode of
raising revenue? They will not They will be the least bur
densome of any mode that could be devised From tables ex
hibited by gentlemen on the other aide, it appears thdt the quan
tuy of silk impoited amounts to fr m eigUteen to twenty mil
lions of dollars, while that of wines is not less than from two to
three millions Now suppose we lay a duty ol twenty per cent
on these two articles, how much of it do you think the fanning
interest of Pennsylvania and the planting interests of the
Southern States wiil ever pay? Anamount absolutely trifling
No, s r it is the rich, it is the luxurious of our great cities who
will pay these expenses of Government, and the frugal tarmei ^1

Mr. DEAN of Ohio aaidhe did not rise to enter at large into
a discussion of this question, noi for the purpose ol making a
speech, but simply to give his views with íespect to the merits
of this bill He had sat, there and li& ened with much pleasure,
it was true, to the eloquence and the declamation of the gentle
men who had preceded him, and he had heard much with re-
gard tothe constitutional powei involved in this question, but
he confessed that he had been unable to dncovci fiom the arbu
ments any beanog that it could l ave on this subject He lelt
himself at all times and upon all occasions bound to keep within
the pale of the Constitution, and in no inst nice, and foi no pur
pose whatever, would he permit himself knowingly to step be
yond its limits This question, with regard to the public lands,
hid, as he conceived, been settled by a long tram of uniform c e
cisions m the action of this House, and he was at a le^s to per
ceive in whatever manner the cession of Virginia, oi that of
any other ¡state, could be brought up heve to thwart the will

He complained that the bill befue th   (omtmttPt; contal el j
a provision m it that the  States of   Ohio    Indiana and   even
others, should leceivetenpercentum on the pioeeedsoi  the
sales of the public lands over and abive what was to be given
to the old States For what purpose, he a=ked, was this provi
sion introduced, and introduced, too, by the very gentleman who
had contended strenuously that the lands should be parcelled
out alike for the public benefit? If the gentleman, with his
impressions of the cession of Vugmia, could have intreduced
this provision, he was at a loss to see v hat had induced him
to do so Why were the new Slates to have ten per centum
more than the old? Was theie not somethjng behind the
scene'* Was theie not something that did not strike the eye?
Why was it, and what reason had been given1 Foi noieport
had been made on the subject He had heard ne reason as
signed fu thisextraordmaiy featureof the bill
Mr W V TOHN-ON io^e and explained why the feature
referred to had been introduced
Mr iiEAN proceeded This was the first reason he had
heard assigned for th-1 introduction of the exception in favor of
the new States Now if gentlemen were satisfied wnh thts
reason then they must look at the matter in a very different
light from himseh He (Mi D ) nw no reason to look to the
prospective mcreise of population m tho«e States, and lie
could not satisfy his mind by any piocess of reasoning why ten
pei cent was proposed to be given to tho e nine new States
If it was supposed that they would mciease in that ratio, pet
haps it was to satisfy them But theie was another feature m
this bill which struck him as somew hat extraordinary It was
provided in the seventh section that 400,000 actes should be
given to the new States foi purposes of internal improvement,
though he had understood it was mtendt d to make it 500,000
Mi W U JOHNSON explained thatu v\as so intended, and
was so written in the manuscript
Mi D lcsumedby snying that it was immaterial to the ai
gument He had asked the reasons upon whi h this bill was
predicated morder to ]iidge of the piopnety of the measure
He did not &ee why this land should be given to those States
He though that the Government had already donated Urge
quintitits of landfor purposes of internal improvement, and
the gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr WinthropI had de
claimed mobt eloquently upon thin point, and he (Mr D) con
fessed that he had almost become a eonveit to his reasoning
Ht contended that this section was part1 U and unjust in its
opei anon, and thereiore ought not to receive th/ sanction of this
committee He was opposed, he said, to the whole bill He
looked upon it at as one that was not called for un iei the
the exigencies of the time, and one that was calculated to work
infinite mischief to this countiy He had heaul much said
about dealing out the bounty of this Govern ment to lelieve the
dihtiessed States He would lepeat that he heaid it said that it
would afford ielief to those states that were laisrely mdtbted on
account ol inteinil impi jvemeiUs, and then/ore it was just
an 1 pioper Ohio misht be in U bt d, mdc 1 she was m Jeb<ed

to be henid in behalf of the \o o-, they intended to £ive theie
would j erhaps, be more time sived than theie was n > v He
therefoie, as he had a heady said, would make no apology for
presenting himself at this time. His object was to present, m
as succinct a mode as possible, the motives and views which
would govern his vote or against this bill lie did not hope to
presentto the committee one single new aigument or newidea,
lor he believed that every argument for or against this bill had
been already suggested in the debate All he asked was the
poor puvilege of culling from the mass of arguments which
had- been made, a few of the íeasons why he would vote against
tins bill
Mr H then pi oceeded to notice the closing remarks of the
gentleman from Maiyland,[Mr W Cost Johnson,] and to ex
press his surprise that he should, after making an eloquent and
elaborate spceeh, filling six columns of the National lntelhgen
cer, close it by saying that he hoped this debate would be
brought to a close the present week Now he (Mr H ) was not
disposed to waste the time of the House, nor was he indisposed
to bring the debate to a close the present week but he was of
opinion that those who had had an opportunity of expressing
their sentiments should be couiteout. enough to extend thesame
nppoitumty to those whohad not He fully concurred in the
hope exprest-ed by the gentleman from Pennsj lvania [Mr
Cooper] that this nation may use its resources m such aman
nei as to make them die means of adding to its piospenty and
welfare in eveiy respect He therefore felt some reluctance m
giving his vote against this bill a* he would do, for he really
did believe that in some respects the distribution of this fund
mi^ht be made to contri! ute to those gieat ends But, m this
instance he lelt himself* bonnd to look to the expediency of this
measure, and while he was willing to see the States m a state
of piospenty, yet hethd nut wish tu &ee the General Govern*
it entso hampered and deprived of its resources as to disenable
it liom proteetmg and delendmg the whole Union
Mr H say that he agreed with the gentleman from Maine
in the view that he had taken m íeference to the pub-
lic lands, that they were a common fund for the benefit of
all the States which accepted it at the time of then cession, or
which have since been eieated, or which may hereafter be
created They were conveyed by the States to the Union as a
common fund, but with a certain limitation, which fund was to
be used for the benefit of the Mates in their respective propor
Hon of the common charges of their expenditure The Con
stitutum made no change in the limitation of the fund which
it placed at the dispon! of Congress, and that limitation was
only that it should beso ue-ed as to mure tu the common benefit
and to the equal benefit of all the States, or, mthe words of the
Constitu ion as nearly as he could recollect them, "That this
power shall not be used to prejudice the claims of the United
States or of any | articular State "
We then he (Mi H ) would contend, po sess the power to
dispose of this fund in such manntr as we think proper, pro
vi led theieby we do out piepidice the nghtb ofany State, or of
the United States He would say thai, if the funds eieated by
the proceeds of the sales of the public lands have, m the fir°t
place, paiel all the expenses m relation to them, and if, m the
second place, thot.e proceeds, after having gone mto the com
mon fund have ¡eft a surplus equal to the common expenses
incimed, then u would be pioper to distribute that suiplus
dmonf the sevetal ^tites Wheiievei the surplus was disco
vete loot to be shilling and nncrrtam, then it might be dis
tnbuted, but nototheiwi&e Mi H nevt went into an exami

someof the aigument^ idvanced by Mi VV C Johnson m its
