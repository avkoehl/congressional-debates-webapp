I $726,184 85 invested for the Smithsonian Insti-
! tution, as per Statement No. 5. The United
; States hold the principal of the Smithsonian fund,
amounting to $515,169, under the act of 18th of
August, 1846, and is bound to pay the interest
annually, for which the stocks, stated in the
table, are held as an indemnity. In addition, there
was in the Treasury on the 1st of July, 1855, the
sum of $683,373 66, balances of various trust
funds, as per Statement No. 6.
The estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending
30th of June, 1855, based upon the actual receipts
of the first quarter, together with the actual bal-
ance in the Treasury on the 1st of July, 1854, were
$84,159,270 35, and the actual receipts were
$85,337,898 05, and in excess of the estimated
receipts $>1,178,627 70, and the estimated ex-
penditures for the same year were $64,345,921 21,
and the actual expenditures were $66,209,922 04;
making an excess of expenditures, over the esti-
mate, of £1,864,000 83; but nothing was estimated
for premiums, and payment of the public debt, for
the last three quarters of the year, nor was any-
! thing estimated for appropriations by private acts
I of Congress.
j The actual receipts for said year were
1 $1,614,004 24 from customs less than estimated,
j and >2,765,394 95 more from lands than estimated,
j and $166,763 01 less than estimated from mis-
i cellaneous sources. The causes which it was
then apprehended would affect the receipts from
customs, for the remaining three quarters of the
fiscal year, had a more stringent operation than
was calculated, whilst the proceeds of the sales
of the public lands exceeded the estimate.
The actual receipts into the Treasury, from
customs, for the first quarter of the fiscal year,
to end the 30th of June, 1856, have been
$17,085,238 28, and $1,554,560 17 less than the
actual receipts of the corresponding quarter of the
preceding year, arising from the same causes that
affected the receipts from customs for the three
quarters of the preceding year; and the receipts
from public lands have been diminished by the
use of land warrants under the bounty land bill
of the last session of Congress.
It will be seen that the receipts from customs
for the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year
1856, have been advanced from the estimated
receipts submitted in rav last report. This has
been done because the abundant agricultural pro-
ductions in all sections of our country will justify
larger exportations, and because of the demand
for provisions in Europe, caused by the war and
limited crops; but with the expectation of less
demand for cotton, and diminished prices, and
also the return of American stocks under con
tinued stringency in the money markets of Eu
the imports. There is no return or estimate of
the gold imported by emigrants, and no return or
estimate for the freights of our vessels that have
contributed to our imports.
The table of tonnage for the same year ex-
hibits our tonnage at 5,212,001 10-95 tons, an
excess over that of the preceding year of 410,000
tons; but it is proper to remark, that the tonnage
measurement of American vessels, under the
present act of Congress, makes the measured
tonnage less than the actual tonnage, whilst the
unreported lost vessels may more than counter-
| balance the difference.
I The table upon the currency justifies the belief
j that there is not less than $250,000,000 of gold
; and silver in the country; whilst there is no rea-
son to doubt the continued yield of the mines of
California, and that the demand for our exports
will enable us to exchange as largely for the pro-
ductions of other countries as in former years,
without parting with our gold and silver in larger
quantities than we produce it.
The demand for our agricultural products for
export, and the consequent good prices, will, to
some extent, stimulate our importing merchants
to bring in foreign goods, becausc of our in-
creased ability to purchase them abroad and con-
sume them at home.
It is believed the check to importations and
consumption from short crops last year will, to
some extent, costinue through this year, and,
with other causes, prevent extravagant importa-
tions on American account, because the war
demand and short crops in Europe will lessen
European consumption of manufactured goods,
and the makers will seek the American market for
their surplus; consequently a large supply of for-
eign goods on foreign account may be expected
in the market, interfering with the profits of the
American importer. Moreover, if tlTe war shall
continue, considerable stringency in the money
market of Europe may be apprehended, derang-
ing more or less the money market in the United
States, according to the intensity there. This
apprehended money crisis in Europe will operate
to repress importations of European goods on
American account, and new enterprises at home,
whilst the continued tide of emigration to the
States and new Territories of the West will in-
duce large investments in the public domain,
thereby absorbing the land warrants, and creating
a considerable demand for money. The aspect
presents a prosperous year for the United States
and its revenue, yet calls for prudence and cau-
tion in expenditures.

ury on die 1st of July, 1857, of $29,672,497 78
The public debt on the 4th of March, 1853
amounted to the sum of $69,129,937 27, which
Ii. nj « authority of the appropriation act of
the 3d of March, 1853, has been reduced, up to
£qo o™ ™i"Lthe 17th °f November, 1855, to
$39,969,731 05, as per Statement No. 3, accom-
panying this report. The sums expended in pay-
ment of principal, premium, and interest, in mak-
ing tins reduction, amounted to $30,100,512 62.
In addition to the public debt, as above
stated, there is due, under treaties with various

the war and for breadstuffs, and the withdrawal
of money from circulation, under an apprehended
scarcity, and its effects upon the money market
in the United States. The advance may not be
realized, but it is believed the estimate is a fair
one; and, at all events, the receipts from customs
and lands will meet the estimated expenditures
as far as they will be called for, and allow a con-
siderable sum for theredemption of thepublicdebt,
should the holders be willing to part with it.
