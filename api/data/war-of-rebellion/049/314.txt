Major-General HALLECK:

The enemy attacked my rear guard, the Second Corps, at Bristoe, about 4 p. m. General Warren repulsed them, capturing a battery and over 100 prisoners. General Warren fought them until dark, the Fifth Corps is now withdrawing and teh Second will be withdrawn to-night. The army will then be here to await teh further movements of teh enemy.

The army is somewhat exhausted by teh recent marches, and unless the enemy compels a movement to-morrow, I shall give them rest.
