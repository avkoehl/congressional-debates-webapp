RICHMOND, May 18, 1864.

(Received Allatoona 20th.)

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

Your dispatch of 16th received; read with disappointment. I hope the re-enforcement sent will enable you to achieve important results.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

General FRENCH,

Rome:

Telegraphic communication is cut off. If you leave Rome under your instructions you will be obliged to march by the south side of the river to form a junction with this army. I mean the river Etowah.

By order of General Johnston:

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

If you leave the place bring the garrison with you.

W. W. M.

CASSVILLE, GA., May 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General MACKALL,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say to you that in the hurried march of his troops to join General Johnston, three of his brigades-Cocklrell's, Reynolds', and Sears'-are without their cooking utensils, and he has therefore to request that you will order three days' rations of hard bread for about 6,000 men to be issued to his chief commissary, Major Murphy. At the end of this time the transportation of these brigades will be up.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

D. WEST,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 18, 1864-8.30 a. m.

General DAVIDSON:

When you evacuate Rome take all the garrison with you and join us where the Atlanta railroad crosses the Etowah River. Do not come here.

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.
