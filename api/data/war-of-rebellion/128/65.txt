consequent inequality of valuation of the same species of property, and the inequality of taxation resulting therefrom.

The present law requires each tax-payer to deliver a written list of his property. In lieu of this blank printed lists should be supplied to each tax-payer by the person receiving the return.

For reasons heretofore expressed in a communication to you dated 7th of April last I would further suggest that Congress be asked to authorize the appointment of a disbursing agent, to be attached to this office, whose duty it shall be, under the supervision of the Secretary, to examine all war-tax accounts and settle the same by his requisition on the Treasury, and to make monthly or quarterly statements, as may be deemed most proper, to the First Auditor, so that his monthly or quarterly transactions, as the case may be, may be presented in one large account, accompanied by the stated accounts settled by him as vouchers.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

T. ALLAN,

Chief Clerk of War Tax.

ORDNANCE BUREAU,

Hon. G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

SIR: On March 28 last I received a letter from you inclosing the resolution of Congress inquiring into the loss of stores of various kinds in the recent reverses of our armies at Forts Henry and Donelson, and Fishing Creek, Roanoke Island, and in the retreat from Columbus, New Madrid, Bowling Green, Nashville, and the line of the Potomac.

In order go give some satisfactory report of the loss ordnance and ordnance stores, letters were addressed to the following officers: Generals Lenities Polk, A. S. Johnston, and Benjamin Huger, Lieut. Colonel Milton A. Haynes, Major W. R. Hunt, Captain E. P. Alexander, and Lieutenants Wright and McClung. But few of these replied; and herewith I have the honor to inclose a report as full as the information which has reached this Bureau will afford.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. GORGAS,

Colonel and Chief of Ordnance.
