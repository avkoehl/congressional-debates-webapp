Major-General REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report that, in compliance with your instructions of last night, the orders directing a movement of my command have been suspended, and that it remains as heretofore. I beg leave to report further that two divisions of Major-General Sherman's command are still in my rear. One of them was encamped in the vicinity of Trenton last night, the other somewhere beyond Whiteside's. If free use of the bridge at Brown's Ferry can be given the former for crossing as it comes up, it may be able to cross the Tennessee to-night, while the latter will not probably reach it to cross before to-morrow.

Very respectfully,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding
