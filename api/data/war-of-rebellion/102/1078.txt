General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: In a telegram of July 6 the lieutenant-general notifies me Indian Territory and Arkansas are in my military division. In Your telegram to me of July 13 only Mississippi, Texas, and Florida are mentioned. Notify me if this change has been made. The department commander for Mississippi is not named. Has any been appointed? The telegram has become so confused in its transmission that I cannot well rely on it.
