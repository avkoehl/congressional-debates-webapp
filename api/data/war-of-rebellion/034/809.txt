I visit General Burnside to-night to settle the question that Morgan raises as to his surrender. From what I can learn of the matter, it is all gammon on Morgan's part. Allow me to call your attention to a proclamation I send you by mail.

DAVID TOD,

Copy of telegrams just received:

SALINEVILLE, July 28, 1863.

I forwarded by special messenger statement of Burbick and Maus than can be relieved on. Burbick was not captain of any militia or volunteer force, on Sunday, as captain of 15 or 20 mounted Home Guards at time of surrender. Major Rue was there, and also General Shackelford.
