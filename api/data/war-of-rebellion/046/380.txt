FORT SUMTER, July 19, 1863 - 6.40 a. m.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN:

Have received the following from General Hagood:

MORRIS ISLAND, July 19.

General RIPLEY:

Having arrived here to-night, my knowledge of location is not sufficient to enable me to answer your inquiry; but Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, who was here during the bombardment, is of the opinion, if we had 3,000 or 4,000 reliable troops here now, we could drive the enemy off the island, to make a move before daylight. Prisoners report four brigadier-generals in front of us and fifteen on Folly Island.

JOHNSON HAGOOD.

It will be impossible to get 3,000 or 4,000 men over at present. Keitt and Graham have not arrived. Taliaferro has gone on to the city. Enemy's fleet off Battery Wagner in shelling position.

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.

FORT SUMTER, July 19, 1863 - 6.45 a. m.

General THOMAS JORDAN:

Please let me know whether General Beauregard desires me to send the Sumter over. If the risk is to be taken, well. If not, she is wanted elsewhere for work. My own opinion is that the work and communication must be done at night entirely. Keitt's regiment not here, and I doubt whether transportation can be furnished.

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

July 19, 1863 - 8 a. m.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY, Fort Sumter:

Dispatch of 6.45 a. m. just received. If risk be too great in your opinion, delay transportation of troops to Morris Island until practicable without too great danger.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY:

GENERAL: In reply to the last paragraph of your communication of the 18th instant, in connection with the general operations in your district, I am instructed to say, that in the event you are forced to evacuate the positions on Morris Island, your proposition to assign Brigadier-General Hagood to the command of James Island is approved. Brigadier-General Taliaferro, in that state of affairs, will command on Sullivan's Island.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
