General WHARTON:

A courier has just arrived from my picket stand. HE reports the Yan kees leaving Carthage. One of Captain [J. W.] Nichols' men, who is in the advanced picket post, was in the vicinity of Carthage, and says their wagons were going toward Gallantin, guarded by their cavalry. The infantry were this side of the Cumberland, on the Rome road, and reliable citizens report six pieces of artillery with them. The scout did not see the artillery. Another scout, coming in late this evening, reports the Yankee infantry near Rome on the march. I have two other scouts out, and when they return I will, perhaps, have more definite information.

Very respectfully,P. F. ANDERSON.

P. S.-Major [W. S.] Bledsoe went off this evening with three companies, for the purpose of burning a steamboat which was grounded
