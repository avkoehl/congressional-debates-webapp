HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864-9.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Received your dispatch of 8 p. m. I will have the work upon the intrenchments pushed as rapidly as possible. Reports of signal officer received. I have just received a report from our scouts that they saw considerable commotion in enemy's lines. I think all these reports go to show that the enemy is adjusting his force to meet the new condition of things.
