of o\ei $48,000,000, in case the proceeds of the
'and sale  hid been distributed according to the
piovisions of that bill, and a deficiency of more
than jjl9,000,000, if the money deposited with l
the Sute", undei the act of 1836, is still consid-
eied a  available to the Treasury Let us pause
before we adopta measuie that shall again involve
us in a heavy national debt. It is evident that,
for several years to come, not a dollar can be
•spired for distnbution And why aie we called
on to legislate on this subject so long in advance '
The adoption of this measure will be in time
when the state of the Treasury will justify it
The duty of deciding on this question does not
devolve on us It will belong to those who shall
representlhe people on this floor when thissouice i
of revenue can be spared ftom the Treasury
without sacrificing the interests of the nation, and
without imposing unnecessary taxes upon the
people.       _________________________                      |

DEBATE   IN  THE   SENATE,
Tüfsdat, January 8, 1839
The bill for the gtaduation md reduction of the price of
the public linds beinj under consideiation, md Mr "V or nb
h iving addressed the Senate is gnen m the Globe of Jan
uiry 22—
Ms CRITTENDEN made some remaiks on
the mipiopriety of taking notes of wh it Senatois i
might say in the waimthof debate, foi the pui pose
of holding them lesponsiblc for the langmge on
subsequent occasions, and chaiacteuzcd it as un-
couttcous, &c
Mi 'iOÜNG slid, by way of rejoinder, the
Scnatoi ftom Kentucky [Mr Crittenden] ob
jects to my taking notes of what may be sud by
honorable Senatois in their plices heie, of words
spoken in the heat of debate, often incautiously
and unguardedly Mr Piesident, I, too, would
condemn such a practice in oidmary cases I
willingly admit, with the Senatoi, that woids
spoken in the heat of debate, incautiously or u^- I
guaidedly, ought not to be treasured up n this
way foi use in our cooler moments But, sir,
this was an extiaordinaiy case The Senatoi fiom
Kentucky [Mr Clay] lad stood foith as the
prominent opposei of the pieemption bill, and
liad, on more than one occisión, used such ex- i
piessions as I attributed to him towaids the set-
tleis upon the public lands in the new States I
took it, theiefore, that he had used them dehber
ately, and was not disposed to take back a word
tint he had utteied I being from the West, sir,
a Representative fiom a new State, supposing
that, on some futuie occasion, it might become
necessary to makt refeieucc to that debate, took
note of what was said, as neai as I could, in the
very language of the speaker, in older that I might
be accujate, and not subject myself to the chaige
of misiepresentation, which has been made in the
couise of this debate
The Senator complains that in all this theie is
a want of courtesy, which should, on all occa
sions, characterize our intercourse on this floor,
legaidless of party predilections Sn , perhaps
the Senator is light I know, Mr Piesident,
that a dcgiee of courtesy highly creditable to this
body does, in gencial, prevail here I only wish,
sn, that it was more univeisal But does this
chaige, under all the encumstances, come with
a good giaee from that side of the Chamber'
How often, within the short period in which I
have been honoied with a seat on this flooi, have
I heaid the Senator's colleigue, [Mr Clay,]
when speaking of the political organization of
this body, exclaim with emphasis, that, consti-
tuted as this Senate was, he had nothing to hope
or expect fiom it' And what is this, sir, but a
denunciation of the whole Administration party
here as being either servile to Executive dicta-
tion, or something equally improper' Letthose,
therefore, who would inculcate the doctune of
courtesy on this floor, set me the example In
relation to the notes which I took on the occa-
sion refeired to, and to which I made reference
in the course of my remarks to day, it is due to
myself to say with what view and for what pur- i
ose they weie taken down. They have not
een published in the newspapers here or else- I

where, no one his a copy of them, and but few
have seen them I may have shown them on a
few occasions, but mo t fiequentlyat my own
home, in my own domestic circle, as well to
the Senatoi's [Mi Clay] own political fuends
as my own But, sir, they were not taken for
any purpose of electioneering, as has been sup
posed, as I am not in the habit of miking stump
speeches over the country Su, is it a subject-
matter of reproach that I should defend my con
stituents against whit I considei unjust and un-
merited denunciation'
Mi President, the people of the new States do
not considei themselves as trespassers or vio-
íatois of the law in going upon and fixing then
homes upon the public lands They aie not
trespassers It is true, sir, that the act of Con
gress of 1807, piohibmng settlements upon the
public lands undei certain penalties, has not been
icpealed, but it has become obsolete—long since
mopeiatne, at least in piactice Since their sot
tlements have been legalized, and then improve
ments secuied to them under the vauous pre
emptton laws from 1813 down to the act of the
last session of Congiess, they consider, and not
without leason and precedent, that they have the
tacit consent of the Gencul Government to go
upon these lands, to make then faims upon them,
and to occupy them in peace when made, and
such, sn , ha& been the practice since my lesi
dence in Illinois, now twenty yeirs and upwaids
and no one on the pait of the Government has,
within that penod, to my knowledge, offered to
tuin them away ftom any lands to which the
Indnn title had been extinguished No, sir, so
far from it, they ha\e fiom time to time been
quieted in then possessions, and illowcd the
pieti icnce in the purchase of the land in the man
ner I hive mentioned
The Senitot [Mi Crittenden] 3avs that the
condition of the squatteis in Kentucky, of which
I mide mention in commenting upon his honor
able colleague's Richmond speech, was totally
dissimilai fiom that of the squatters on the pub
tic lands in the new States, that in Kentucky
the squattei went upon the land with his title in
his hand, in the fiim belief that he was the right
ful ow nei of the land, v, hereas the squattei upon
the public land went upon it in the full knowl
edge that it not only did not belong to him, but
that, in so doing, he was violating the law I
cannot, Mi President, perceive any substantial
diffuence in the parallel of the two cases
The squatter in Kentucky believed that he had
a title, when in point of fact, he had not He
made his improvements in good faith, believing
that he was the owner of the land, and m the ex;
pectation that he was to enjoy them when made,
and his children aftei him, and it was hard to
tui n him out without cither making him full com
pensation for his labor, oi permitting him to be
come the purchaser fiom the true owner at the
assessed value of the land m its unimproved state,
at the time he fust went upon it This, sir, was
but fan, but reasonable and just, as was conclu
sively shown by the aigument of the Senator's
colleague, in his Richmond speech in 1822, from
which I have quoted And how, sir, is it with
the squatter in the new States' He, too, went
upon the land, as he believed, with the tacit con
sent of the Government, he made his home upon
it, mroiporated his labor with the soil, and ten-
dered it productive, in the film belief that the
Government would give him the preference in the
purchase at the minimum price of ^1 25 per acre,
when it should be brought into maiket, that the
same indulgence which had been extended to
others since the year 1813, would also be ex
tended to him I now ask the Senator [Mr
Crittenden] if there would beany more piopn
ety m turning him away as a trespasser, without
full compensation for his labor, because he had no
title under such encumstances, than there would
be m the case of the Kentucky squatter whose
title had been found to be defective >
Sir, there was a time in Illinois, during the early
part of the territorial form of government in that
country, when the registers of the land offices j
were authorized to grant "permits" to peisons to
settle upon the public lands, upon their paying ,
some small amount of money in consideiation of
the privilege, but such instructions have long since
Senate.
, ceased to be given to the registers, and, in my
judgment, taking the whole practice of the Gov-
ernment togethei, this law of 1807 should be con-
sidei ed as obsolete, for this purpose at least, and
ought not now, at this late day, to be interposed
as a barrier to the settlement and impiovementof
| the countiy Sir, I have never heard of the first
attempt on the paitof the Government to cnfoice
that law, ovcept in a few cases wbeie a very few
peisons only had gone upon the lands that had
been resolved as lead mine lands, to be leased by
the Government, or upon Indian lands to which
1 their titles had not been extinguished
Mr President, since I commenced these re-
marks m defense of the position I occupy in this
dobater an extract from the speech of the honor-
able Senator from Indiana, [Ml   Tit-ton,] on the
subject of the preemption bill of the last session,
has been placed m my hands, containing the Sen-
Í atoi 's [Mr  Clay] own declaiation as to what
he did say on the occasion referred to, and, for
the purpose of showing that I did not misrepre-
sent him in attributing expressions to him winch
it has been intimated he did not utter, I beg leave
to lead the ext>act to the Senate-

I the honoiable Senatoi, [Mr  Cia\,] in his own
| woids, as taken down by the honoiable Senator
from Indiana, [Mi Tiprov ] and in what does it
I differ as to the material pait of my statement, as
I quoted hoic to day '   Mr President, in the course
of a very ft w remarks which I maxle at the last
1 session, 1 lead at my table here, from the notes
| I had taken, fiom this same paper used here to-
day, a portion of these same expressions which I
have attubuted to the honorable Senatoi, [Mr
[ Ci \y,] and I did not understand him as then de-
nying them
i     Mr CLAY said it was untrue that any such
I paper had been shown to him, that he did not
know that such a papei was in existence, until
j very recently informed by a member of the other
( House, from Illinois, that such a one had been
used to his prejudice by the Senator from that
State, [Mr Young,] duiing the recess of Con-
gress, and he was also understood as denying the
correctness of the statement
I     Mr  ItOUNG said he did not say that he had
shown the papei to the Senator, [Mr Clay,]
I but he did say that he had read from the same
[ papei at the last session, at his table, when the
I Senator from  Kentucky [Mr  Clay] was in his
seat, and must have heaid him     He may not
have seen the paper m his hand, but ceilain it is
I he (Mi   Y ) read ftom it a poition of the same
expressions which he attributed to him to day,
and he did not then understand him [Mr Clay]
as denying them, or as disposed to take back a
word that he had said
Mr President, I do not undertake to say that
the expressions attubuted to the Senatoi  [Mi
Clay] were used m connection, as I have them
noted, and as I read them     They were used in
the course of his remaiks, and such only were
t ken down, as he went along, as were deemed
most exceptionable and offensive to the settlers
on the public lands     When he had concluded,
and befoie I left my seat, I made the copy fiom
them used here to day, and at the last session
All that I hate now to add, is, that whethei  the
Senator from Kentucky  [Mr   Clay] saw the
pipei oi not, the statement it contains, as read
I fiom mv place to day, is correct and true, and
