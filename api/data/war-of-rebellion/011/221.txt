RUSSELL'S, May 28, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I occupy with two of my brigades, one of Hurlbut's, and one of McClernand's a ridge running east and west, which has a road down to the Mobile and Ohio road. The country to my right is a dense wood; in my front is and open field, extending to the left, in front of Davies. One of the enemy's batteries is in sight, on the road near the blacksmith shop; they have fired at us many shells, doing little execution. The enemy has a large force in my front and a line of battle extending across the railroad to the west. Troops come in from the west; I think Chewalla. They have made their appearance at Modlin, on Bowie Hill Cut; but there is a force-Ross' brigade-there. I left three regiments in my intrenchments. This is a good place to fortify. Shall I intrench, or shall I simply picket the place strongly and reoccupy my works?

Answer at once, as I must have daylight to lay off the lines.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S, May 28, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

At 7.30 I shall open on the enemy's pickets at the house in my front two 20-pounder rifled guns. At 8 a.m. shall move one brigade down the main road, one bearing to the right of the fields, one of Hurlbut's from his left diagonally toward the blacksmith shop, and one of McClernand's by the right along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. We, keeping abreast and fighting by head of columns, will try and reach Knight's [the blacksmith]. Shall I hold all ground I make or fall back on present intrenchments? I will have about 6,000 men, leaving the trenches guarded by detail.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major-General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN:

Whether you will hold the ground you take or fall back to the intrenchments must depend upon circumstances. Advance cautiously and not too far. It seems to me that Knight's is too near the enemy's works to hold. The main object of your move is to unmask the enemy's batteries. Keep this in view in making your advance, and if you find a good position before reaching Knight's, stop there.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, May 28, 1862.

Major-General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN:

If not too late, hold your position. If, however, you consider the risk too great, fall back.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
