Lieutenant Colonel W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Arkansas:

SIR: I have delayed sending down the detachment of the Third Wisconsin Cavalry for the reason that I have had information that there was a force of some 300 or 400 rebels, guerrillas, &amp;c., in the vicinity of Clarksville. The detachment is composed of 118 men, only about a dozen of them mounted. I regard it as unsafe for them to attempt it. As it will be necessary for them to have some little transportation, it is impracticable for them to go down on the south side of the river, on account of the stream between Dardanelle and Little Rock. I expect soon to reoccupy Clarksville. I will send the detachment down just as soon as it is practicable. I send these dispatches and reports with an escort of fifty cavalry commanded by Lieutenant Phillips, and have to request that you will start it back as soon as possible.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General F. STEELE,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

SIR: This is the first time for the last three weeks that I could spare a sufficient number of cavalry to form a suitable escort to go to Little
