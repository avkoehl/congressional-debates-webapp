Provisional Army. This would give you an organized corps and independent action.

I suggest, unless in your opinion it is absolutely necessary, that you decline to receive any cavalry into the Provisional Army, as you are aware the cost of this arm of the service is very lieavy, and it is more than probable that the necessities of your position at Charleston will not require this outlay.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF WAR,

Charleston, S. C., March 3, 1861.

Peter G. T. Beauregard having been appointed brigadier-general of the Confederate States of America, and having been ordered to assume command of the troops in and near Charleston Harbor, will be obeyed and respected accordingly, and all State officers of the volunteers, enlisted men, and militia, on duty, are commanded to obey all orders emanating from him.

D. F. JAMISON.

WASHINGTON, March 4, 1861.

Gov. F. W. PICKENS, Charleston, S. C.:

Do not permit any attack on Sumter without authority of Government of Confederated States. This is all important. Inaugural means war. There is strong ground for belief that re-enforcements will be speedily sent. Be vigilant.

LOUIS T. WIGFALL.

I concur, and believe this Government will act promptly.

L. Q. WASHINGTON.
