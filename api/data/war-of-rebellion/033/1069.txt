HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Camp Bragg, November 14, 1863.

Brigadier-General MARMADUKE,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: In regard to your position, the commanding general says you must be governed by circumstances. If it be possible for you to subsist during his absence lower down the Terre Rouge, he would much prefer it, as it would render concentration with Price more easy, besides covering better his front. Moreover, the general expects to make with General Smith permanent arrangements for our future.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS MARMADUKE'S DIVISION,November 15, 1863.

Respectfully referred to Major-General Price.

I can forage my command for two or three days on the Terre Rouge. If I remain here, I can give no protection nor support to the infantry nor they to me, unless the enemy should move upon Washington. If I make my camp on the Terre Rouge, I cannot protect Washington as I am now doing. I wish to have orders on the subject.

I beg to refer General Price to my letter to district headquarters, dated November 14. It more fully expresses my views.

Very respectfully,

J. S. MARMADUKE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., November 15, 1863.
