Loan Bill—Mr. Hunter.
000, viz- $12,000 000 under the bill, and $5 000,-
000   under the Treasury note act of 1841. It is,
therefore, no question as to the form of security
for the debt, but a simple proportion to increase
the power to borrow
But, Mr Chairman, shall we require this loan
of $12,000,000, even it we permit the Secretary
to expend all that he asks, except so much as we
can demonstiate etier canao or ou« ht not tj be
expended? he propose an expenditure of
$31,708 502, from this deduct the means of the
year, $25 489,119, and we have a balance oí
$6 219 383 Bui this balare3 mcludrs the new
appropnations asked bv ti e War Department,
which amount to $2,521,336 I am not yet
satisfied th t any p moa oi these appropria-
tions wi'l be nece san, butif we allow ihe item
of $825 637 foi ihe suppression ot Indian hos-
tilities, ihe residue, which is psked for ortifica
Uons old and new, for arrnamerts, and for sur
veys of loads, surel) cannot be a ]u t demand
upon ihe Treasury, m its present stale, and at tne
present session, called for extraordinary purposes
Deduc ing these items,which amount to $1,695 498,
from the abive balance f $6 219,383, and it is
reduced to $4,523,885. This balance is ."gain sub
ject to a reduction of $1,110,000 for the rede nip
tion of Treasury nrtes, fs before stated, and we
have left $3 413,885 To this add $1,000,000 for
surplus means m ihe li^asuiy, and we have
$4 413 885 as tae maximum which, under any
reasonable v ew, as it ie>ms to me, rught to be
borrowed But sir, miy it not depend upon the
furth-r action of this House, whether a 'oan, even
for this amount, will be nee-essaiy? The Secretary
recommends (and ti e majority have b en swift
heretofore 'o lollow his reco rin endaUon ) that we
should lay a duty oí twerty per cent upon nearly
all of the anieles now imi urtid fiee oí duty This
tax, he'uppeses, ™iU < dd lo tic revenues oí the
present jear $5,251,388—a sum more than suffi-
cient to cover the maximum d-ficiency as I have
just found li Should this ux be laid, how sh ill
we justify ourselves m making a loan oí $12,000,-
000, irredeemable for ten years, wh°n even that
amount of debt could be exnnguisned by the means
thuslunusntd within two vears, and w ibout a re-
sort to the public lands'
Under a general view, then, of ihe liabilities and
resources of the Governmen , 1 cannot „ee a pie-
text tor boirowin0 a cen at this time, even with-
out the proposed taxation, and especially with it,
unless it be tbat ihe Secretary has crowded most of
the expenditures within tne qua'ter ot the jear
This, sir, is a matter of aommi.traiion, and it is
manifest thai a Secretary might thus create a large,
trough temporary deficiency, «.ven if ihe means
exceeded the charges oi the>ear oy the $4,000,000
which he ha< askeu as a surp'us If we continue
to make new at propria ioii^, and justify the ex
pehdi'ure of unpie„eeien ed an onn s ef the  old,
we shall hardly , vo d th mischiefs of this capri-
cious mi ce o administering the finances, by any
mens which we ire htel/ to afford, extta/agant
as so,«e of our measures have been and may be
If theprov s.ons of law, Mi Chairman, afford m
extravagant Secretary the powei of was eiul ex-
penditure, the only mode ot restraining him is by
limiting his means to what is n censal y and proper.
But, s r, tht recommendation, of th1 Secretar/
of the Treasury are s0 manifestly extravagant and
unnecessary,  in a financial point of view, mat
1  am forced to look to other objects u r the motives
which impel him Why is it that he seeks to in-
volve his Department m embarrassments which do
not belong to' ir? Why this recommendation ioi
more than 'h rty muliofis of iunded debt, when no
one can see the necessity that requires it? Why
this dtsposi'ion to depart irom all precedent m the
expendituie of ¡>o large an amount of the out-
standing appropriations1 And why the recommen
dation in the present cond tion oi t*ie Treasury, to
give away the proceeds of the pubnc lands, and
thus throw th  who e taxation upon ihe import trade?
It cannot be for the purpose of exhibiting U the
world ho i much money h- can induce the Amere
can people to expend He cannot wish to coniraet
debt for the mere pleasure oí owing the money.
His purposes are deeper than these    If our ex-
H. of Reps.
penditures are extravagant, if a large debt be
iunded, irredemable for years, a though we might
have the means f extinguishing it soonei, and if
our revenues are to be derived tiom customs alone
—it is obvious, ti at the pretence and the plea will
be thus furnisred for a h gk and protective tariff
Nor is this all, sir [ has been well «aid that
the capital for a National Bank could not be paid
m specie, without a is tess and pressure which
mi°ht render the institution unpopular at ns com-
mencement But, on the other ham , f its capí al
shoul 1 con ist of stock*, it would go into i yerauon
smoothly Thirty one millions or United S<i^
stock will furni h the means lo start n, and the dt-
posites arising horn large revenu°s u (¡ether wi h
the pprmaa<"iii suip u o $4,000,000, will make it
profitable to the shar holders.     Viuch, tnen,sn, a
I object to this loan cull a-- a mere financial ana
suie, I am still mor c pposed to it when 1 eonnect
it wi h the system of wiich it is a rart, and whi h
eenis to have ecu the primary obj ct in the Se
creta y'a recommenda ions. There s no rece*suy
for creating thirty one millions, of stock, and no in-
telligible reason for proposing it, uole ■> i be to
build up that g gantic system of plunler, which a
•i Bank, a tariff and a distribu ion of the public
Ian s, will affoid he mean-, < f constructing— i se
ríes of measures wh ch must resub, as I have said,
in an entire revolution of oui Gwernment Si-
'eiit it will be—peaceful it mav ee, but a revilu-
tion, deep and entire, m the «p m of our ip ntu
lions, in the policy oi th ciuntr/ and ¡n the disfn
bution of the po v r wh'fh is to govern it
Mr Chairman, I sav it unde- sense of all the

II   this syitt in bv. ptrmiit ntly las' red upon us, it
must íesult in revo u ion w idi is to taki the

And am I to be t'°teired ttom expiessmg my so1 se

ciento the e'armg and p esum¡ tuous length o
complaining that \< was u lust ¡n asectioieil pom
ot view, am I to receive the suggestions oí the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania as  a hint to  submit
without murmur, or else to prepare for the horrors
of civil and of servile war, which that foreign and
h led libeller of Southern, ay, and of Northern feel-
írg, has foreiold for us? Sir, I like not these dark
outpourings, these gleomy fancies, these mysten-
r us hints, they savor too much of an argument ad-
dressed to my feats, to induce me to submit to that
to which my reason and sense of justice may not
assent But I avk the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia if it is v se, if it is statesmanlike, to shut our
eyes to the evils which mav exist in the Govern-
ment that we administer? Is it not rather a duty
ic detect them, that v. a may remove them xf we
hive the power, or watch over and mitigate their
tetidenc es, if their existence be inevitable? Is it
tu t a poor compliment to the understanding of our
p ople, ir we suppo e that they would abasidon
intir insttutions) merely because they are not per-
te<*i'  Su, I will take the nsk of all the imputations
\hich the gentleman from Pennsylvania, or even
th Edmbwgh Review, may cast upon those who
utter the sentiment I reaffirm ths proposition
of my friend from South Carolina, that even
eq al taxation, with unequal disbursements, is on
evil—to some extent a necessary evil, I admit, but
when carried beyond the necessity of the case, un-
ju affable, and when pushed to great lengths,
o'ten insupportable He who denies that this
is an e/il, not only here, but m all Govern-
menfs, must shut his ears to the voice of history,
and c'o e t is eje-s to the lights of experience. The
inequality either in taxation or disbursement is
íoumitely connected wiih that greatest of all pro-
blems m poli ical science—I mean the question as
to tr>e distnbut on of wealth It is this, sir, which
tiom thi first organization of human society has
disturbed it raosi deeply. It has divided parties;
it h s overthrown Governments, it hss convulsed,
and sometime disorganized society uself The
q íestion whether the distribution of wealth shall
be regulated by industry and skill, or by the arti-
fic al distinctions of law, is that upon which main-
ly depends the stability of every Government and
the happin ss of every people The one mode of
of distribution uses the selfish instinct to stimulate
productive agencies to their highest degree of ener-
g , and for the most beneficial purposes, whilst the
other, inviinu it to plunder, turns man upon his
brotner, either n open war, or in the more silent
but i arcely less deadly confl cu of selfish and un-
just legislation Who does not see that there is a
neceas >ry connection between this and the question
ot uiiequ.,1 taxation and disbursement, and hence
have arisen the great contests which have dis-
turbed the social condition of man, not only here,
but el ewhere5 It is not, sir, as has been said, a
contest between capit ü and labor, or between pro-
p rty and numbers, but between the tax-consuming
a d the tjx-pajin,> parties By the tax consul
Tg | irty, I i em ibose who íece ve more mosey
from  tic Government than they contribute to it,
nd by t e tax paying, tnose n^a contribute more
than t ey receive,—the one look ng to Government
for the means of livn g, the other i íewing it as a
t ecs arv but expensive mstiumem tor the protec-
tion ot per on     nd property,—tne one  interested
o have 'he revenues as large and the disburse-
ment as unequal as po sible, the other mtereited
in equal di bursements, and in paying as little as
ma> b consistent with the attainment of the great
mural ends tor which alone they value their Go-
vernment In proportion as the former
pr*v.iil, the incentives to industry dimi-
m b and th  moral feeling of the people is de-
pre ed The few who administer ihe Govern
men , and lay taxes for the mere purpose of con-
suming th m, divide the great mass of those op-
po>ed to th m, by leading one class or one section
o* the coun y to plunder another But when
they have thus rendered the honest returns
ot labor and the nghis of property insecure,
the people, forsaking the art-, of industry,
use the ballot-box for the means of living, and,
sinkms under indolence end depravity, either fall
before the pressure of invasion from without, or
seek relief frora tne oppressions ot 'he few, by
si bmtliuig to the despotism ef one These par
ties bave existed, and will exist, in all Go
vernments.     The   history   of  their   contests  is
