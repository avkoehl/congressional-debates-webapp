MOBILE, April 11, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WAKLER:

A plan is on foot to capture the transport Illinois, supposed to be destined for Texas, with the Miramon, now lying at New Orleans, which has been promised for the purpose. Those entgaged in the enterprise do not wish to compomise the Government, but request me to ascertain beforehand that their action will not conflict with the policy or plans of the President. An immediate answer is respectfully solicited.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Milledgeville, Ga., April 11, 1861.

J. J. HOOPER, Esq.,

Private Secretary, &amp;c., Montgomery, Ala.:

SIR: By direction of his Excellency the Governor, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply to say that as there are but few artillery corps in the State, and as they would be much needed in case the soil of Georgia should be invaded, His Excellency deems it inexpedient to permit any of such companies to leave the State, except the Washington artillery, Captain I. P. Girardey, of Augusta. This is the best - armed and most thoroughty drilled artillery corps in the State, and yesterday they were ordered into the service of the Confederate Government. Besides this corps the late contingent requisition will be filled with infantry troops alone.

I am, sir, very respectfully, &c.,

H. H. WATERS,

Secretary Executove Department.
