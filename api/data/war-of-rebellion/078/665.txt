IV. All officers, of whatsoever grade, are charged with the discipline of their respective commands, and where a commanding officer is called upon for protection to the private rights of a citizens against the depredations of any soldier of his command, he will grant it immediately, and, if he fail to give it, proceedings will be instituted against him for neglect of duty and violation of this order.

By command of Brigadier-General Morgan:

J. L. SANDFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN., Abingdon, June 25, 1864.

Colonel W. M. BRADFORD,Bristol, Tenn.:

What dispositions have you made to capture the enemy?

J. L. SANDFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN., Abingdon, Va., June 25, 1864.

Colonel W. M. BRADFORD,

Bristol, Tenn.:

General Morgan desires that you will not move too rapidly against the enemy. If you could throw Lillard down, and skirmish with him as he advances, and retire before him, so as to draw him on, and in the mean time Pridemore move down between Clinch Mountain and the river, so as to gain their rear, the force might be captured. You need fear nothing in driving them this way. Go down yourself and watch his movements closely and keep the general constantly advised, that he may move mounted troops to your assistance if necessary. The men will be sent to the bridges.

J. L. SANDFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN., Abingdon, Va., June 25, 1864.

Colonel W. M. BRADFORD,Bristol, Tenn.:

Direct Pridemore to move night and day until he gains the rear of the enemy. You will move Lillard and Morelock as seems best in your discretion. Capture the enemy if it can be done by a pursuit to any point this side of Knoxville. Re-enforcements will be sent to Bristol if necessary. Keep us advised of your own and enemy's movements.

By command of Brigadier-General Morgan:

J. L. SANDFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

TUPELO, June 25, 1864.

Major-General LEE:

Have just received dispatches that there are 3,000 enemy at La Grange. Have ordered Chalmers up to this place. Would it not be well for you to order Mabry up also?

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
