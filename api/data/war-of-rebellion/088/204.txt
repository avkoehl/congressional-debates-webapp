Major-General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: The enemy are making a spirited advance, but are held by one of my brigades dismounted. I have two regiments at the intersection of the Charles City, New Market, and Quaker roads. This force finds the enemy on the Charles City road in their front. I think Hampton's division of cavalry has arrived. A prisoner, whom I forwarded, told me that a large force of cavalry, which he believed to be Hampton's, was on the Charles City road about six miles from Richmond, and that infantry was at the same point.

Yours, respectfully,
