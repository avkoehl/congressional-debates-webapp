Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Chief Justice, we now
desire to put in evidence rather in a more
formal manner than has been done heretofore,
although the substantial facts have been brought
before the Senate, we believe, by the honorable
Managers themselves, the proceedings which
took place at the time of the removal of Mr.
Pickering by Mr. Adams, accompanied by a
certificate that the letters to and from various
persons between the 2!)th of June, 1799, and
the 1st of May, 1802, have been for many years
missing from the files of the Department of
State. The correspondence itself, therefore,
cannot be produced from the originals, or from
copies of the originals, but no doubt they are
correct, as those letters were read the other
day by the honorable Managers from a volume of
Mr. Adams's works. They are the same letters.
The letters are not here; they are not in the
Department: but they are printed in that volume
and were read from the volume the other day.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Wait a moment.
We are not certain about this. [After an ex-
amination of the documents offered in evi-
dence.] Do I understand the counsel for the
President to say that these papers show any-
thing different from what was shown by the
Managers?
Mr. CURTIS. Xo. I stated that in substance
the matter was now before the Senate, but we
wanted the formal documents to be put in.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. The only difficulty
I find is this : that you do not put in all; you
do not put in what was done on the 12th of
May as well as the 13th of May, 1800.
Mr. CURTIS. We put in what there is here.
Mr. EVARTS. You have already put in
the other.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Very good.
Mr. CURTIS. We offer these documents
from the Department of State.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Very well.
The documents thus offered in evidence are
as follows:
United States op America,
Department of State:
