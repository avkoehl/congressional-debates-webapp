ined. Separated into classes, the ratios rejected and exempted per 1,000 examined are as follows:

Recruits ................................................. 128.8

Substitutes .............................................. 156.8

Drafted men .............................................. 135.1

This shows a less ratio rejected for physical and mental causes of drafted men than actually exists, and but for the reasons stated would appear greater than that of substitutes. (See Table Numbers 1.)

The ratio of rejections of recruits and substitutes differs from that of drafted men under the several sections of the paragraph embracing the causes of exemption. The difference is explained by the voluntary and involuntary nature of the presentations of the applicants, and by the ruling applied to the different classes. The decidedly feeble man, the confirmed consumptive, the paralytic, the deaf, and those having ulcers of long standing seldom enlist; while indifference and negligence on the part of this class to be relieved from enrolment places their names in the wheel, and many times their persons before the Board of Enrollment for examination as drafted men.

Under sections 8, 20 and 29, diseases of the skin, loss of teeth, and hydrocele, the ratio rejected of recruits and substitutes is greater than for drafted men.

THE TWELFTH DISTRICT OF OHIO.

The Twelfth District is composed of six counties, Pickaway, Ross, and Pike forming the western, and Fairfield, Hocking, and Perry the eastern portion of the district. The western counties embrace sixty miles in length of the Scioto Valley, the corn-growing Eden of Ohio. The eastern counties are composed of elevated table-land and mountains; the former is well adapted to agriculture, and the latter abound in iron, coal, building stone, oil, whortleberries, hoop poles, and shingles.

The district is divided into eighty-five sub-districts, containing a total population in 1860 of 139,456.

June, 1863, 18,371 names of persons of twenty years of age and under forty-five were enrolled as liable to do military duty; one in seven and five-tenths of the total population.
