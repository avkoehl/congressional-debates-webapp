The subsistence department of the army has provided articles which, if properly used, will prevent the evil otherwise arriving, and it is of the utmost importance to the health and efficiency of troops, as well as of economy and success, that the effort thus wisely made should be energetically seconded by every officer of the army charged with the care and health of our men.

Colonel W. T. SPICELY,

Commanding Detachment Third Division, Atchafalaya Bayou:

COLONEL: Your dispatch to General McGinnis is received. Hold on to your present position until you hear from Colonels Davis or Guppey. They may wish to return to camp on the road by which you went out, and, if so, it will be necessary to have the points which you now hold guarded. As soon as they join you, or you hear that they will not return your way, you can march with your command for camp. It was left discretionary with them to return by whatever route they thought best.

Colonel W. T. SPICELY,

Commanding Detachment Morgan's Ferry:

You will send the cavalry detachment with you down to Livonia to-night. Instruct the officer in command to so post his men as to guard, if possible, the roads leading from False River to the Atchafalaya, and to remain there until he is joined by a force which will be sent out from here in the morning on the down-river road. The object of the move is to head off, if possible, and capture a certain Captain Williams, who with thirty men appeared this evening on the least-mentioned road. Please direct the officer in command to be active and vigilant, and cut off the retreat of the party, if practicable.
