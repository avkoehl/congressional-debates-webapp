The foregoing figures will perhaps give some idea of the magnitude of movements through this military division.

As an item to show the peculiar hazard attending military railroad operations, it may be stated that during the last six months of the fiscal year the wrecking train picked up and carried to Nashville sixteen wrecked engines and 294 car-loads of car-wheels, axles, bridge-irons, &amp; c. Most of the wrecks were caused by guerrillas and rebel raids.
