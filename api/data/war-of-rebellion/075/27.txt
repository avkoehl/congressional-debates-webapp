Major-General SHERMAN:

General THOMAS,

Ringgold, Ga.:

Dodge's two divisions are coming in by the cars. Logan's three divisions are closed up on Geary, who is crossing the mountain at Whiteside's. I will send General Corse down to-morrow to meet General Garrard, and lead him across by Whiteside's, the Coal Mines, Trenton, and Dug Gap, to La Fayette, there to join McPherson.

We are one day behind time, but I will get McPherson to Gordon's Mills before we make any real demonstration. In the mean time get your troops well into position.

The five cavalry regiments are all now en route for Nashville also, and they will make a good reserve.
