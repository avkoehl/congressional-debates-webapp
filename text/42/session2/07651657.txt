1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1657
This company looked forward, when they
entered on this work, to long years of expend-
iture without profits. They went into this
business; they sank in it, perhaps, from six to
ten million dollars of actual money of their
own in establishing this line, which to-day
navigates the Pacific ocean. Their capital
stock sunk in market value below one third of
what it formerly ruled at. What has been the
result of these efforts? The commerce between
San Francisco and Japan and China has in-
creased, but increased indeed slowly; one
thing that has prevented a more rapid increase
being the unwillingness of the Oalifornians to
encourage, or, I may say, permit the immi-
gration of Chinese.
Nevertheless the Japan and China traffic
has steadily increased, and in connection with
that commerce has grown up also a great col-
lateral unsubsidized trade. To-day, in the
inland seas of China and Japan, great steam-
ships of twenty-five hundred to three thou-
sand tons' burden weekly traverse those inland
waters and penetrate into the different ports
of northern China and Japan, carrying the
flag of the United States. So that the com-
merce of those seas is now mainly conveyed
by American bottoms, and a large majority of
the imports and exports of Yokohama come
and go under the American flag.
The time has now come when this trade has
reached such dimensions, has begun so obvi-
ously to incline toward our shores, that more
ships must be put on. Not at all because it is
now profitable, not at all because now more trips
will pay, but because it is necessary to retain the
control of the trade; because, unless they are
put on, the English will put ships on the route
and compete for and reap the benefit of this
growing commerce. This company, therefore,
come here now and ask us to aid them to
this end. What is the special plea for this aid
on their account? It is because they miscal-
culated in respect of the opening of the Pacific
railway. Instead of taking till 1875 for its
completion, it was hastened by the subsidies
granted to it by the American Congress, and
finished five years or so earlier than had been
expected; and by virtue of the subsidies of
a hundred millions or so in land and money
given to their overland rival, this steamship
company lost, years before it would otherwise
have done so, its great Isthmus trade, the
result of its own just effort, yielding it a profit
of two millions or thereabout yearly: lost it
not by any fault or short-coming of its own,
but lost it, if I may use the expression, by the
premature completion of this overland rail-
way.
The special claim of the steamship company,
then, in asking for aid, is that its weakness, so
far as it is weak, and its inability unassisted
to build up this giant trade, have been created
by the extraordinary grants which this Con-
gress has made in behalf of overland travel—
grants which have deprived it of its own
justly acquired and profitable Isthmus traffic,
but for the loss of which it could unaided have
borne all the burdens incident to this great
effort to get control for this nation of the traffic
of the East. I say, therefore, sir  
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. BUBCHAIUX I withdraw my amend-
ment to the amendment.
Mr. BECK. I renew it.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Will the gen-
tleman allow me, before he_ proceeds, to make
a proposition? I ask unanimous consent that
the debate on the amendment now pending
may be closed in twenty minutes.
Several Members. Oh, no.
Mr. BECK. Mr. Chairman, I regret ex-
tremely to be compelled to oppose this subsidy
in the form originally presented by the com-
mittee. I agree with gentlemen on the other
side that no commercial enterprise is so im-
portant to this country now as to secure the
trade of China and Japan. I think that it is
perhaps the last great field that is open to
us. Other nations have secured the mass of
the commerce over the Atlantic, the Medi-
terranean, and Indian seas. This is z, traffic
which is now stretched out to us. As I said
the other day, if we have sense enough to
seize it, we may hold it against the world,
and make Europe pay tribute to us by carry-
ing her silks, teas, and spices across the con-
tinent.
The proposition is now made to subsidize a
line of steamers in order to obtain this trade.
I do not think that ,is the way to accomplish
the object. Why has our commerce been
driven from the ocean? Why are only for-
eign flags seen in our great eastern sea-ports,
under which our commerce is carried on with
European nations? Why, when we had in
1860 a tonnage of nearly six million tons, have
we now a tonnage of only a fraction over three
million tons, and that maintained by a monop-
oly of our internal and coastwise trade?
Because in 1862 and 1866 you raised your
tariff upon everything from the then average
of nineteen percent., and imposed tariff duties
to foster monopolies until we struggle now un-
der taxes on an average of forty-eight per cent.
You have thus enabled England to increase
her tonnage from less than six millions in 1860
to nearly nine millions, if I recollect right,
while ours has been reduced from almost six
millions to little over three millions. You
have further increased that tariff in practical
effect by imposing burdens of internal taxa-
tion upon all our people to keep up and per-
petuate this monstrous system. Compare the
value of our imports in 1860 and in 1868, as
shown in the table prepared by Commissioner
Wells, and you will find that we have only in-
creased a fraction over $2,000,000 in the value
of goods imported, while the amount of tax
levied is threefold, with the free list propor-
tionally diminished.
Mr. Wells's table is as follows:

Now, when you have thus killed commerce
by taxation, it is proposed to grant a subsidy
at the expense of the already overtaxed people
to make those men whose interests and business
have been destroyed by your legislation, the
allies of the tariff monopolists, and thus make
them strike hands with those who are already
too potent for this Congress to control, in keep'
ing up that system of legislation which has
driven our commerce from the seas. Of course,
if this company is to have this subsidy, all the
others now waiting must be provided for and
protected in the same way. If the exigency is
so great, and I admit it is great, why do you
not allow American citizens to go and buy
ships wherever they please, as the gentleman
from Illinois proposes ?
It does not alarm anybody to talk about
"British gold." In July, 1870, when there
arose an exigency no greater than this, when
it was evident that war was about to break out
in Europe, the President of the United States,
elected by the party that has the majority in
this House, sent to Congress a message, in
which he said :
" The vessels of this country at the present time
are insufficient to meet the demand which the exist-
ence of a war in Europe will impose upon the com-
merce of the United States, and I submit to the
consideration of Congress that the interests of the
country will be advanced by the opportunity to our
citizens to purchase vessels of foreign construction
for the foreign trade of the country. An act to this
effect may be limited in its duration to meet the
immediate exigency."
Such was the recommendation of the Presi-
dent of the United States. Was he controlled
by British gold ? That will hardly be sug-
gested; his advice was spurned. The high
protective tariff men, aided, I regret to say, by
a few on this side of the House, would riot
allow his recommendation to be carried out.
On the contrary they preferred taxing the
people still further in the way of subsidies
instead of following that recommendation-—
the most sensible the President ever made in
aid of commerce. Compare your carrying
trade in 1859 and 1860 with what it is now.

No sensible man can mistake the logic of
facts like these. Yet, instead of removing the
evil, it is proposed to increase it by forcing our
own people to contribute by subsidies to swell
the protected interests, instead of letting mer-
chants in this great Pacific trade buy cheap
ships wherever they can, and thus compete on
equal terms with other nations. More taxa-
tion for the masses seems to be the only idea
entertained to aid any enterprise, however
important.
Talk about subsidies to special interests,
when by your duties upon Bessemer rails,
covered by patents and by taxes upon all kinds
of iron, you are increasing the cost.of every
railway in the country over three thousand
dollars a mile, so that the farmer cannot
move his grain to market; his wagons, hia
plows, his horse-shoes, and all implements
which are used in agriculture are taxed from
fifty to eighty per cent. He is taxed almost
to death to maintain monopolists, from hia
hat to his boots, from his cradle to his coffin ;
his salt, his coal, his leather, his lumber,
everything he tastes, touches, smells or looks
at, almost, is burdened with taxation.
And now you propose to tax him again and
keep up another monopoly, for fear that by
allowing free ships on the Pacific jind Chiaa
seas the great interests which have crushed
out commerce, and will continue to destroy it
unless you will lift the burdens from labor,
will fail to get their share of the money.
Look at the products of agriculture which
have to compete unprotected in the markets
of the world with the pauper laborof Europe,
so much dreaded by the monopolists. They
amount to over $3,000,000,000 annually,while
all the other great interests do not produce
more than $1,000,000,000. Three fourths of
all our wealth is produced by the sweat of the
farmers who are taxed to death and cannot be
protected, and now it is proposed to tax them
still further, because you will not let men
