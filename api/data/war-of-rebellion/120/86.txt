Expenditures were judiciously made and almost entirely for articles of extra diet.

In relation to the late difficulty in obtaining provisions for the sick in hospital, owing to the refusal of the commanding officer to sign the provision return, I beg leave to refer to the accompanying report* on the subject from the surgeon in charge. It appears that for five days the sick in hospital were entirely without rations, excepting such as were obtained from day to day from the prison mess-room. The commanding officer while in a state of intoxication refused to sign the return because of a fancied error, and then left his post for several days, leaving the return unsigned and authorizing no one to act in his stead during his absence. That this is the fact is stated by several of his officers. I have called on the issuing commissary, Captain R. C. Rutherford, who confirms the statements, so far as coming within his knowledge, made by Doctor Worrall. He also furnished me the accompanying copy* of the disputed provision return as signed by the post adjutant, by order of Colonel Weer, march 21. Captain Rutherford states that for some time after Colonel Weer assumed command of the prison the provision returns were signed by the post adjutant. Shortly before the difficulty occurred Colonel Weer directed the commissary to recognize no papers not signed by him in person. This order has since been rescinded.

It appears to be the evidence of nearly all the officers at the post that the commanding officer is frequently so much under the influence of liquor as to be utterly unfit for duty. Charges have been preferred against him, and I understand that a court of inquiry has been held in his case by order of General Rosecrans.

It is to be hoped that this prison may soon be placed under command of an efficient officer, for as it is matters are going from bad to worse.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. CLARK,

Surgeon and Acting Medical Inspector of Prisoners of War.
