General WILLIAMS:

My corps officer of the day reports the following:

The enemy have retired their line of pickets from the river and established a new line back of the city. Their earth-works are full of men, and they are mounting heavy guns and moving artillery.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 6, 1863-6.15 p. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The following has just been received from General Barnes:

Colonel Vincent reports that Kemper's Ford the pickets yesterday were weak and few appeared. This morning they are stronger and show themselves in considerable numbers. Last night two supports were heard to move nearer the river, being moved back at daylight. It was not possible to ascertain whether they were cavalry or infantry. At Ellis' Ford the enemy makes no attempt to conceal his movements; has but small force, and there is apparently but little, if any, strengthening the line.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
