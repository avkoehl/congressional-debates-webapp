HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,August 30, 1864-6 p. m.

Brigadier-General McINTOSH,

Commanding First Brigade:

General Torbert wishes you to send one good squadron on the Berryville Winchester pike, as near to the Opequon Creek as you can. Instruct the officer that is detached to move rapidly, and if he meets any parties of the enemy to endeavor to take prisoners; information is wanted. A woman at the toll-gate just this side of the Opequon will give any news she may possess.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF HARPER'S FERRY,Harper's Ferry, August 30, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The condition of the forces this morning seems unchanged. The firing yesterday was a heavy skirmish between our cavalry and Breckinridge's corps; but few casualties on our side. The enemy retired across the Opequon.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
