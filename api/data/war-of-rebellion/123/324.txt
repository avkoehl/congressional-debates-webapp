The Governor is absent. An immense number of people are here. Many counties tender a regiment. Can we say that all will be accepted under call for the war? An immediate answer is very important.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Two hundred and fifty of our men have enlisted this week. Richard Yates, Governor, has added the following to my communication of the 6th:

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I earnestly call your attention to the fact of the foregoing of President Osborn as very important and true. The Illinois Central Railroad is to be regarded as no small part of the military strength of Illinois, and has been and is still of the greatest utility in transporting troops, munitions of war, &amp;c.

RICHARD YATES,

Governor.
