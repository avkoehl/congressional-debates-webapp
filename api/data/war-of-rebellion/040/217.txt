DUMFRIES, April 16, 1863.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Commanding Twelfth Corps:

A detachment of the Second Division, Ovarial's cavalry, are here, numbering 300. The remainder will be here during the day. With the roads as they are, from reports of the cavalry officers, it will almost be impossible to get the artillery and wagons over them. Their wagons are not expected until to-morrow. Rain and storm were severer yesterday that when the corps passed, and the roads are in a worse condition. Please answer if I shall start to-morrow.
