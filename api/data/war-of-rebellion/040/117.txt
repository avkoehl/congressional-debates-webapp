The general directs me to say that the strength of the force to guard this line must depend upon circumstances, of which you must be the judge, as you will be held responsible that the duty is properly and thoroughly performed.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DUMFRIES, March 2, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel H. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The Twelfth Illinois Cavalry have the proper orders to go. This leaves us without a single cavalryman of any use whatever to this post. In regard to protecting the telegraph line, it cannot be done without cavalry to patrol on the Telegraph road, and as soon as the bushwhackers and rebel cavalry find out that we have no patrols on the road, they will turn the right of the Eighth New York Cavalry's picket-line and have everything their own way. As for protecting this place, we have no doubt but what we have sufficient force within ourselves, and ask no more. We should have cavalry at our disposal to make this post of any service whatever.

W. R. CREIGHTON,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
