HDQRS. CAVALRY DIV., DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,

Memphis, Tenn., June 29, 1865.

Brigadier General W. H. MORGAN:

GENERAL: I have the honor to ask what additional force the general commanding the district desire to garrison the post at Grenada, which has at this time but fifty men and four officers. I had ordered the troops at Senatobia to report at Grenada, and that re-enforcement of fifty men was deemed by me sufficient for all military purposes. But if a larger garrison is required at Grenada I will be glad to know how large it shall be, and I can forthwith supply it. The order to abandon the post at Senatobia has been countermanded.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. S. ROBERTS,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, June 30, 1865.
