Lieutenant L. B. JENKS,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, U. S. Forces, Morganza, La.:

I have the honor to make the following statement for the information of the general commanding: The Sixty-second, Sixty-fifth, and Sixty-seventh Regiments U. S. Colored Infantry were formed into a Provisional Brigade last March. By Special Orders, Numbers 282, Department of the Gulf, series, 1864, the Sixty-fifth, Sixty-seventh, and Ninety-ninth Regiments were formed into the Second Brigade, First Division, U. S. Colored Troops. The Ninety-ninth has since been ordered to Tortugas, Fla. By Special Orders, Numbers 41, Department of the Gulf, February 13, 1865, the above-mentioned order, Numbers 282, was revoked. When I received said Order Numbers 41 I asked General Ullmann, then commanding, the condition of the Sixty-fifth and Sixty-seventh Regiments, and was informed by him that they would still constitute the Provisional Brigade the same as before Special Orders, Numbers 282, was issued. No order was issued to that effect, but it was the well-known intention of the general to constitute a brigade of these two regiments on the right of the fort. If this is still the intention I would respectfully ask an order to that effect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. J. EDGERTON,

Colonel Sixty-seventh U. S. Colored Infantry, Commanding Brigade.
