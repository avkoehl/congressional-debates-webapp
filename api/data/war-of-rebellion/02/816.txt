part of the enemy to pass the battery at Gloucester Point, you are directed, on the approach of a vessel of the enemy, and when she shall have gotten within range, to fire a shot across her bows. Should this not deter her from proceeding on, you will fire one over her; and if she still persist, you will fire into her. Should the fire be returned, you will capture her, if possible. Similar orders have been used to the naval officer commanding battery.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 8, 1861.

Brigadier General D. RUGGLES, Commanding, Fredericksburg, Va.:

GENERAL: I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of communications from Major T. H. Williamson, engineer, Virginia Army; Lieutenant H. H. Lewis, Virginia Navy, and W. H. Kerr, brigade inspector Virginia volunteers, in relation to fortifying Aquia Creek.* The general commanding desires me to say that the object in view is the defense of the avenues of approach to the terminus of the railway, rather than the protection of the few vessels at Aquia Creek; that the instructions given by him with reference to this matter were based upon the report of Captain Lynch, Virginia Navy. You will therefore, being on the spot and in possession of the facts requisite to a proper disposition of the works and the troops under your command, exercise your judgment, in connection with that of Captain Lynch, with reference to the defense of the avenue of approach to the terminus of the railroad and the general protection of that country.

The importance of erecting batteries at Mathias Point is apparent; but from the report of Captain Lynch, which represents the necessity of supporting such a movement by a larger force than you had at your disposal, it was considered advisable to employ the guns originally intended for that point in the defense of the approaches to Fredericksburg by rail or river.

Very respectfully,

J. M. BROOKE.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 8, 1861.

Colonel A. G. BLANCHARD, C. S. A.:

COLONEL: I have been directed by the governor of Virginia to take charge of the troops of the Confederate States until otherwise directed by the President. I desire your regiment to repair to Norfolk and report of duty to General Gwynn.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
