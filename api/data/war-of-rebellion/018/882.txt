Shenandoah via Columbia Bridge to Fisher's Gap or via Port Republic by Brown's Gap. But this must be judged of for yourself.

STAUNTON, May 6, 1862-9.45 p. m.

Major General R. S. EWELL:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of to-day* has been received. Has the enemy left Columbia Bridge yet? Do not leave the valley so long as banks is in it and I am on the expedition of which I spoke to you. If you will follow banks down the valley you will soon ascertain whether he designs going to cross the Blue Ridge.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Major-General.

MAY 7, 1862-6.20 a. m.

Major General R. S. EWELL:

GENERAL: I am leaving for the west in great haste. I will send you a spy named McVicar, whom you can send to Front Royal to ascertain whether the enemy leave the valley. If the enemy go down the valley beyond the neighborhood of Mount Jackson or New Market you should follow him, but not compromise your safety.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Major-General.

CONRAD'S STORE, May 7, 1862.

General L. O'B. BRANCH:

GENERAL: Yours of this date* has just been received. I cannot leave this place at present, but it is of the last consequence that the enemy do not cross the Rapidan. Should they cross the Rappahannock and your scouts report them in force to march on toward the Rapidan, it will be necessary that you move the balance of your brigade, or at least one regiment, to the support of Colonel Lane. I presume you have a battery, although it is not mentioned in your report. Should you not have one attached to your brigade I desire you will report the fact at once.

You ought to require some two or three noises for mounting your express riders.

General Jackson is not here and I may not be able to leave for several days, and indeed events may bring you up here, or at least in this direction. Under my circumstances the enemy must not get the south bank of Rapidan.

Colonel Hays, Seventh Louisiana, killed 9 Federals to-day (left on field); took 21 prisoners. They carried off a number of wounded and scattered, throwing away arms, &amp;c., the horsemen swimming the river in great confusion.

General Trimble's brigade is near Stanardsville, ready to support you at the Rapidan or return here, as circumstances may require.
