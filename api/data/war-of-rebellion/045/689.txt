HEADQUARTERS ENGINEERS, July 14, 1863-11. 30 a. m.

General NAGLEE,Sandy Hook:

The enemy all crossed the river last night. The railroad bridge will probably be restored by the company as soon as they are permitted. It should at once be made passable for infantry, if this operation can be done without using Major Spaulding's command, which are already fully occupied with the pontoons, and without interfering with the plans of the railroad company.

G. K. WARREN,

Brig. General Vols., Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac.
