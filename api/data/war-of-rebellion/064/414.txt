CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 16, 1864.

General EWING:

I have ordered Company B, Eighteenth U. S., African Descent, to New Madrid. They start first boat . I have ordered a supply train and one company of horse to Bloomfied to relieve the infantry. Will send one other as soon as Captain Hipple can supply it; can't now. Have instructed Hiller as to scouts, spies, and guarding against surprise. Shelby has four rifled guns. Scatterville is in the corner of the State of Arkansas and Greene County, near the Saint Francis, above Gainesville. My force is extremely small for the interest we have to guard.
