burg. Says he is not in the habit of drinking too much, but when he got safe in Dixie he took a frolic, became noisy and was arrested. The only paper sent to me is his letter to General Winder herewith inclosed*. I recommend this man be discharged on taking the oath of allegiance and that he be permitted to join a volunteer company.

He carried them off and this paper was among them. Numbers 3 he says was given him by Aden Thompson. The names on it are names of bushwhackers. He explains this one thus; Men who were brought in by the U. S. troops and took the oath of allegiance; afterward they violated their oaths by shooting at their trains. These men were to be shot when found and his business was to hunt them up. He says he was taken with a scouting party when in pursuit of such men. Numbers 4. This paper contains the certifications of several men that Henderson was a spy. The signers are said to be men worthy of credit on aoth. I recommend this young man be held as a spy.
