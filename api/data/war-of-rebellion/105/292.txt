Wright.) We then lost no time in making search for the place where the train was attacked, but we had not travled over three miles when we met a detachment of Company G, Sixth Infantry California Volunteers, in command of Sergeant Holt, who informed us that Private Mills was killed and Private Berry missing, both of Company E (they being the two men detailed to return to Camp Iaqua with the mules), and I have since learned from the men in charge of the Iaqua train that they (Mills and Berry) did not wait for them to come up, but kept about three-quarters of a mile ahead of them. I met a detachment of Company C, Sixth Infantry, in command of Sergeant Wing, at the same time that I met Sergeant Holt and detachment. He said he had been out a few days and had seen three bucks and one squaw, but did not get a shot at any of them. We then proceeded on our way to Camp Iaqua and came across Lieutenant Hackett and a detachment of Company G, Sixth Infantry California Volunteers, who told me he was in search of Private Berry. Continued on for the camp, where we arrived at 5 p. m., and turned over the prisoners to the officer of the day, by direction of the commanding officer. I will here state that those who participated in the engagement deserve praise for the manner in which they conducted themselves throughout the whole affair. Distance marched during the six days about 100 miles.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

On May 7 went up Lawrence Creek to the mouth of Booth's Run; from thence over the mountain to the prairie between Kneeland and Iaqua, where I encamped after marching fifteen miles. On the 8th started for Iaqua, which point I reached at 9 o'clock, a march of seven miles. Total estimated march of forty-two miles. No Indian sign whatever had been seen on the trip.
