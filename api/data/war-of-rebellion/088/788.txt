7. I would suggest that the batteries and redoubts be numbered or marked, and that the designation of each work be located in some conspicuous place in the work.

8. I would suggest that the garrisons of all the inclosed works be authoritatively fixed. These works, properly commanded and garrisoned, ought to hold the lines even should it be necessary to remove the troops from the rifle-pits connecting these works. I think a palisade ought also to be placed across the gorge at Fort Alexander Hays at the Strong house.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report no change observed or reported in the enemy's lines during the last twenty-four hours. Picket-firing is kept up constantly. A few shots were fired yesterday by the enemy's artillery and replied to promptly by the batteries bearing on the point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. M. EDGELL,

COMMANDING OFFICER FIRST BRIGADE:

The brigadier-general commanding directs that you detail a sufficient number of regiments to furnish a force of about 800 effective men to go out a dark as a support to the line. They will be in readiness at dark, when a staff officer from these headquarters will show them the position to be occupied. They are to bivouac during the night and return at sunrise, unless otherwise ordered. It will not be necessary that they should take tents or that any unarmed men should be sent. The senior officer will take command.

I am, very respectfully,WM. R. DRIVER,
