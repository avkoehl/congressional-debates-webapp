REASONS SHOWING INJUSTICE OF QUOTA.

Up to December 21, 1864, our total calls for men was 197,360, up to December 31 our total credits for men was 198,711; leaving of men to be deducted from the quota assigned under call of December 21, 1864, 1,345.

In February, 1865, the quota is assigned after all credits are deducted of 32,887. This is required out of a State population of 1,700,000; yet Ohio with a population of 2,400,000 is required to furnish only 26,000 men under this call. So that, with 700,000 less population than Ohio, Illinois is required to furnish nearly 7,000 more men.

Under the call of July 18, 1864, we all know the draft was enforced against Iowa. She was then behind in her quotas. Except in a few sub-districts the draft was not enforced in Illinois, for she, including all calls upon her, was only behind as a State in then men 13,440, with a surplus of 35,875 three-years" men to answer a call for 52,057 one years" men. Yet now under this call for troops Iowa is exempt from draft has no quota upon her enrollment and population, whilst Illinois has 32,887 required from her.
