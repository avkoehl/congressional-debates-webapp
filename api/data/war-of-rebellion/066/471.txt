HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., May 4, 1864.

Flag-Officer TUCKER,

Commanding C. S. Forces Afloat:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that the inclosed dispatch* was intercepted by our signal corps yesterday afternoon. If shows that communication with the enemy is carried on with apparent ease from this city. It is of great consequence that at this time, when the troops are being withdrawn in such numbers from this department, our movements should be concealed from the enemy if possible.

The major-general commanding being temporarily confined to his house to-day induces me to correspond with you direct.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., May 4, 1864.

W. J. MAGRATH, Esq.,

President of the South Carolina Richmond:

SIR: Having been called upon by the War Department to forward to Virginia a very considerable portion of my effective troops, it becomes necessary to make every effort to provide for the safety of this department, and especially of this city. In view of this, I have entered into communication with his honor, the mayor of Charleston, requesting him to organize the very efficient fire brigade of this city into companies for service in case the necessity arises. I have ordered all the detailed men in my different staff departments to be organized into companies for local defense; still further to increase this force, I earnestly request you to muster into a similar organization all the employees of your company in this city capable of bearing arms. You may rest assured I shall not call for the services of these men, except under circumstances of actual and grave necessity. I am fully convinced that you will appreciate the utility of this step and afford me all the assistance that lies in your power.

Believe me to remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

May I request that you will give no more publicity to this communicate than is necessary to effect the organization.
