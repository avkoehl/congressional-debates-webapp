rear, which had been re-enforced the day previous, was ready for the attack. The force for which the signal was intended had retired the day previous, but the guns were answered by General A. J. Smith, commanding the rear guard, who opened a brisk fire at daybreak and maintained a very spirited action for several hours, in which the charge of the enemy was gallantly repulsed and his forces driven back with severe loss. The losses on our side were 6 killed and 15 wounded. On the afternoon of the 24th, the column took up its march for Alexandria, undisturbed by the enemy in flank or rear, where it arrived on the 25th and 26th. Our forces were in no disorder, and in nowise dispirited.

Had the river been in condition to admit, we might have assumed the advance, but the water had fallen so low that it was impossible for the fleet to go below the rapids at Alexandria. There was no course left for the army but to remain for the protection of the fleet. The fleet above the rapids comprised nine iron-clads - the strength of the fleet of the upper Mississippi - indispensable to maintaining the supremacy of the Government on that river, or to the protection of the mouth against domestic or foreign enemies. It became, therefore, indispensable that the army should remain at Alexandria for the protection of the fleet. The advanced corps of the enemy manifested a determined spirit to concentrate all his forces in this vicinity, either for an attack on Alexandria or to get possession of the river below, for the purpose of cutting off our communications. His force, concentrated for this purpose, numbers from 30,000 to 35,000 men. It is indispensable that all the force of this command should be retained here, and the orders given to General Smith by General Sherman to rejoin his command east of the Mississippi were countermanded.

On the 28th, a reconnaissance of the enemy in force caused an expectation of an attack and a general engagement, but the day passed without other conflict than that of sharp skirmishing between the advance cavalry of either army. The movements on both sides of the river below Alexandria indicate his purpose to avoid an attack on this post, and to concentrate below for the purpose of cutting off our communication with the Mississippi.

The army is in good spirits and condition, has plenty of supplies for the present, and is perfectly confident of success in any engagement that may occur with the enemy. A pontoon bridge has been thrown across the river, for the purpose of offensive operations against any detachments of the enemy on the left bank of the river, and the construction of a wing-dam across the river, for the purpose of raising the water so that the gun-boats may be floated below the rapids, has been commenced. The line of defense, the position of the town, and the location of the bridge and the dam, to which reference is herein made, are indicated on the map* inclosed, which will present an accurate view of the position of our army at this time. It is necessary only to say that we are confident of being able to maintain our position without injury, and are grieved only that it is at present rendered impossible for us to co-operate with any general movements of the armies east of the Mississippi.

Major General David Hunter arrived on the morning of the 28th. He has delivered to me your dispatch, and communicated to me your views as to the future operations of this force. He has made himself acquainted with every feature of our situation, and can repre-
