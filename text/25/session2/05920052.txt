tion

At the Second Session of the Twenty-Third Con-
giess,during the Piesidency of Gen Jackson,adutm-
guished and able gentleman, whose talents and poli-
tical tact has commanded my highest admiration, ex
erted, in opposition to the Admimsti ation, succeeded
Mr Stevenson in the Speakei's chair—I allude to
the honorable gentleman (Mr Bell,) liom Tennes-
see Ho v did he oigamze the committees as to
political ainngement? Did he give (o the Opposi-
tion a majority on these leading committees? He
had too high a sense oí honor thus to betray his po-
litical associates If he was not justly chargeable
with servility and submission to the rescripts of the
psjace for such organization, does it become the
followers in his wake, to denounce the Speaker for
pursuing a precedent set by the leader of their par-
ty on this floor' By a reference to the 33d page ol
the Journal of the 2d session of the 23d Congiess,
it will be  perceived, that on  the
Committee of Wa) s and Means were six Admi-
nistration  aid three Opposition
Forugn Affairs, seven Administration and two
Opposition
Post Office and Post Roads, six Administra-
tion and three Opposition.
Military Affairs, eight Administration and one
Opposition
Commerce, five Administration and four Opposi-
tion.
At the First Session of the Twenty-Third Con-
gress, the Opposition had a majority m the Senate,
who determined to change the rule relative to the
appointment of committees Accordingly, the)
took from the Vice President, Mr Van Buien, the
power of appointment, and transferred it to ihe Sc
nate plow was this pen cr exercised in the com
position of th" committee--1 The 35th page of the
Senate Journal gives the response The commit-
tees consisted of five members, viz
Finance, four Opposition and one Administration
Commerce, three Opposition and two Adminis-
tration
Naval Affairs, four Opposition and one Adminis-
tration
Public Lands, four Opposition to one Adminis-
tration
Post Office and Post Road*, three Opposition to
two Administration
This Committee on Finance were appoint-
ed to «it in the recess, and investigate the af-
airs, etc o' the Bank of the United Slates It
consisted of four Opposition members, and one
Administration, (Tudge Wilkms,) who being ap-
pointed Minister to the Court of St Petersburg, did
not attend the investigation—(see Journal, p 391 )
"Was this complained ot as unfair'' or was it thought
tyrannical and unjust by the friends of the Opposi-
tion' When operating m their favor, the rule has
beeniigorously enlorced Why should they now
Complain, when applied t.o theinseh «**   The tacts
developed pi ove conclusively that the Speakei has
violated no linage or pi mciple in the organic ar-
rangement of the committees.
The conduct of the Committee of Ways and
Means at the exira session is denounced, and is
said to have been such as to render it unworthi of
trust What outrage upon the rights and liberties
of this House or the nation did they commit''
When yield their own judgments to the Executive
mandate, and registered the decrees of the palace?
When interposed a barrier, excluding the people
from their representatives'! Sustain the accusa-
tion, that the committee are sutlty of these charges
so boldly made, and I, for one, will go as far as the
farthest, not only to withhold any subject from be-
ing referred to them, but to purge the national
councils from such unworthy members The
pioofis upon those who file the accusation If
they fail to sustain they charges, they occupy no
very enviable niche in TJtfc temple of fame He
who wilfully calumniates another, is destitute of
eiery honoiable feeling
In what do these high crimes and misdemeanors
of the committee, consist?
1st That they assentrd to and knew that their
chairmin consulted the Secietary ol the Treasury
on the financial bills
2d That at the request of the chairman, 'he Se-
cretary tiansmilted to him drafts of some of the
bills, not one ol which was adopted by the com-
mittee
W„s there any thing lepiehensible in this? or
was it in accordance with the usages and prac-
tice of committees fiom the origin of the Govern-
ment The thud section of the second arltclc ol
the Constitution, dnccts tint the President "^h ill
from time to tune give to the Congress information
on the state of the Union, and íccommend to lieu
consideiation such measures is lie shall judge ne-
cessary and expedient " Undei this clause, the 11 -
commendations of the President are annually I ml
before Congress In thi s he certainly does not
derogate from either the "letter or spirit" oi the
Constitution The second section ot the act e 11-
bhshmg the Ticasury Bepartmeni,expiesslymii e
it the duty of the Secretary "to digest andprepaic
plans for the impiovemcnt and management of the
revenue, and for the support of public credit " For
whif purposp is (his officer "to digest and prepaie
plans'!" Evidently to communicate them to Con-
gress, and to the committees of Congress whose duty
it is to ¡eject or mature bills to cairy the plans de-
vised and digested into effect In the origin of the
Government it was not thought to be either dicta-
tion from ihe White House for the Secretary of the
Tieasury, to submit to Congress, in a report, the
plan digested for sustaining public credu, or servi-
lity m Congress to receive and act upon these sug-
gestions An early report of Mr Secretary Ha-
milton, in 1795, exhibits the view that many of Ihe
fiamen. of the Constitution, and of the law orga-
nizing theTieasnry Department, took of the duties
ol the Secretary relative to ever) subject connected
with the icienue The custom of committees con-
sulting with, and requiring information from, the
heads of Departments, m rehtion to matters inti-
mately blended with their duties, his been uniform
and unbroken,during every Administration, and on
all occasions) when required, the Secretary of the
Treasury has communicated wi h committees of
the House, on subjects connected with ihe finances
of the nation The Secretary of Slate, in relation
to foreign affairs, has, by that committee, unques-
tionably been called upon for information, and
doubtless, sir, you (Mr Adams) have frequently
communed with the chairman during the period
that you so ably filled the station of chief of tint
Department The measures taken by committees
relative to a Bank of the United States, presents
a striking instance of the intimate relations sur>
sistuig between the Secretar) of the Treasury
and committees connected with finance
The plan of a national bank had its origin m a
report of the Secietary of the Treasury ol the 13th
of December, 1790 A n<.monal for the renewal
of the charter was presented to Congress on ¡he
29th of January, 1810, which was referred to a
committee of seven—Mr Montgomery of Pennsyl-
vania being the chairman, a gentleman of as high-
toned patuotism and of as pure moral integrity, as
ever graced ihe councils of this country. This
c •maim e, thiongh their chairman, addressed a
letter to the Secietary, "t equating lam to furntsh
such information ot observations in relation to the
subject-mattn thereof'as connected mlh the financial
an I commei ctal interests of the Uiuíeá Slates " In
reply, the Secietary (Mr Gallatin) referred the
committee to a repoit he had made to the Senate,
in which the plan was developed on which the re-
chaitei, m his opinion, should be predicated
Was this application, in the purest days of our
Republic, deemed an outrage on the rights and
liberties of the House, and the committee thought
unworthy of further trust and confidence? The
discoveiy had not then been made that it was con-
tamination to call on the proper head of the De-
partment for mfoimauon. The suspicion of "clan-
destine" an angements between the committees of
this House and the Secretary, found no abiding
place in the bosoms of honorable members. At
the ihud session of the thirteenth Congress, John
W t pp( ■> y as appointed chanman of the Commit-
tee of Wajs an 1 Means, and on the 14th of Octo-
bei, 1814, lie consulted with, and applied to, thp
Secietaiy of the Treasury, ' io suggest any other or
such additional piovxsions as may be necessary to
icvive and maintain public credit " The plan of a
bill for the mcorpm atwn of a national bank wa?
submitted by the Secretary to the committee,
m his response to the sail of the chanman, and
acted upon by them In the House, after discus-
sing foi weeks the bill for the creation of a bank,
on the 25th November Mr Lowndes moved its re-
feicnce to a select committee, which was adopted.
Mr Low ndes was appointed the chairman of that
committee, and on the 27th November consulted
Mr D illas, ti en at the head of the Treasury De-
puttiHiit, and received his suggestions with the
high lespect to which they were entitled What
this distinguished South Caiolmtan did not hesitate
to do as chanman of a committee, might certainly
be done bv the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means w ithout reproach. At the fir=t
h ion of the Fourteenth Congress, a select com-
mute e was appointed in, lelation "to an uniftnm
cwrency," of which Mr Calhoun of South Caro*
Inn was chanman On the 24th December, 1815,
the Se< íetaiy of the Treasury, at the request of the
committee, addressed a letter to their chairman, to
which was appended " the outline ol a plan for the
n ihonal bank, i ejerred to in his letter " Did the en-
lightened and patriotic men who composed the
committee, or the House of Representatives, deem
tus an umuthon/ed intrusion and usurpation of
powei' The idea never entered the mmd of any
member of the committee, or of the House. The
piactice, now denounced in unmeasured lan-
guage, his received the sanction of precedent id all
past times in the history of the Government, men
of the highest or ler of intellect, of ihe purest pnn-
cip e-., and ol the most ardent patriotism, failed to
() scovrj the evils dtpcted, from the practice of
consult i ion v Uh tnc beads of departments Why-
should the present Committee of Way s and Means
be an exeep'ion to the general rule1 Why should
•bey be now arraigned and condejnned, for the
effort to obtain aecuiate and correct information
on subject'- pertaining to their duties' Does it arise
from the reckle s chaiac'er of ihe Opposition?
£>( e-, " the end justify the means'"
Bu ah ' this committee, at the late session, did
not rend in lie cnmniUee mom the memorials pre-
sented'or th. establishment of a national bank.

loom all the memorials and all the names ap-

the same mint—stereotyped editions of a common
origin—m the same words and letters, from the
crossings of the t to the dots over the %. What a
flood of light they were calculated to shed on the
subject' Punted and reprinted by the orders of
the House—morning after morning laid on the
desks of the members. Who had not seen them ?
who had not read them? True, alt must have
seen and read them, yet they wer^ ijot rf^d H*<^
