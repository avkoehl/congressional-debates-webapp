Sir, this table presents in a nut-shell the history
of the cod fisheries. Compare their progress with
that of almost any branch of industry m the coun-
try, North or South, and their barrenness and
unprofitableness to those engaged in them will
be made conspicuous Compare them with the
whale fishery statistics, which the Senate com-
mittee embody m the same table with those I have
quoted. There were but four vessels, with 1,2.10
tons, and ninety-eight men, engaged in the whale
fishery in 1815. In five years, the number of ves-
sals had risen to 103, the tonnage to 32,387, and
the crews to 2,590 men. The table exhibits a
rapid and almost uninterrupted rate of increase
down to 1857, when the number of vessels was
816, the tonnage 195,772, and the crews 19,584
men. Compare the progress of the cod fisheries
with that of the production of pig-iron. Accord-
ing to the last annual report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, the production of pig-iron in 1820
was 20,000 tons; m 1830, it was 165,000; in 1840,
it was 375,000; in 1850, it was 564,755; in 3855,
it was 1,000,000; and to-day it is doubtless a mil-
lion and a quarter tons, or more than fifty-fold m
thirty-eight years.
If we compare the cod^fisherics of New Eng-
land with the coal productions of Pennsylvania,
the contrast is still more striking. In 1820, ac-
cording to the Secretary'sreport, the coal product
of that State was only 365 tons—barely a load for
a schooner; 1111830, it amounted to 174,734 tons;
in 1840, to 865,414 tons; in 1850, to 3,254,321
tons; and in 1856, the coal product of Pennsyl-
vania was 6,751,542 tons'
I find, in the repoit of the Secretary of the
Treasury, a statement of the export of cotton
from 1821 to the present time. The total produc-
tion of the country would present a still more
striking contrast with the progress of the cod
fishery. In 1821, the export of cotton was
124,893,000 pounds; in 1830, it amounted to
298,459,000; in 1840, to 743,941,000; in 1850, there
was a temporary falling off, the amount being
635,381,000 pounds, while m the preceding year
it exceeded 1,000,000,000 pounds; in 1856, the
export amounted to 1,351,431,000 pounds. In
marked contrast with these characteristic devel-
opments of American industry, how beggarly do
the statistics of the cod fishery appear! Thirty
years ago, the number of men employed was equal
to what it is at present, and the tonnage nearly as
great. It is true, that within a few years (seven
or eight) an unusual rate of advancement is ob-
servable; but if the bounties be withdrawn, we
shall quickly see the cod fishery abandoned for
more lucrative pursuits. No one will question the
assertion that the men engaged in it are among the
most enterprising and intelligent of the American
population. It is enough to say of them that they
are New Englanders, to procure universal assent
to the proposition; and it may be laid down as an
axiom in political economy, that any branch of
industry which flags in the hands of New Eng-
land men must be essentially unprofitable.
Mr. Chairman, I now beg leave to present a
few brief extracts from high authorities upon the
importance, in a national point of view, of pre-
serving the fisheries as a school for seamen. The
French Government pays a bounty of fifty francs
per man to sailors engaged in the cod fisheries.
It. is admitted that the bounties are essential to the
existence of the fisheries. " The cod fishery,"
M. Senac says, " furnishes more than a fifth part
of the number of our seamen, and by far the best
portion of them. There is no cheaper, better, or
more useful school for the formation of seamen
for the Navy, and none is moic capable of exten-
sion and development; the doubling of the con-
sumption and exportation of the products of the
fisheries would furnish our fleets with twelve thou-
sand more seamen." in 1841, M. Rodetaffirmed
that " without the resources which were found in
the sailors engaged in the fisheries, the expedi-
tion to Algiers could not have taken place/'
The English have always fostered their fish-
eries by bounties. I might give some amusing
illustrations of this fact, which have been col-
lected by my intelligent and indefatigable friend,
Mr. Sabine, in his report on the fisheries, pub-
lished by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1852.
He cites from a British statute passed in 1653,
which provided:
" That as well for the maintenance of shipping, the in-
crease of hsheunen and marines, and the repaumg of port
town*, a* for the fp.umg of the flesh viciu.il ot th«  lenhn,
if nor ho lawful for any one ro cat tle-h on Wednes-
days and Satuidav*, unless itndct the foifeituie of £3 for
the offense, excepting in cisosot Mckm'Si, and tito-e of
special licenses to bo obtained. For tluvi-s lieon*^. peons
were re(jnn<jd to pav about m\ dollar-*, krnuht- and their
wive> about thiee dollars,and other person?, one doilai and
d 1m! f.'"
1 might give from Mr. Sabine's report a curious
specimen of these indulgences to eat on prohibited
days, but the clock admonishes me that my hour
is running out. I refer all who wish to be thor-
oughly informed on this subject of fishing, to the
admirable report of Mr. Sabine, who seems to be
inspired with a relish for wholesale fishing, as
ardent as that of Isaak Walton for the more quiet
and pleasant amusement of angling.
I will here notice some statements and argu-
ments which were made some weeks ago in the
other wing ofthe Capitol. The distinguished gen-
tleman who introduced the proposition into that
body for the repeal of the fishing bounties, and
which has passed, attempts to ndiculo and under-
rate the present importance, of the cod fisheries,
compared with their condition when the Consti-
tution was formed. He presents us with figures
or statements to show that in 1790 the tonnage
employed in the cod fisheries constituted an eighth
ofthe total tonnage belonging to the country at
that time; while at the present time the proportion
is as one to forty-eight. The Senator has been
led into this error by an error in the Treasury
statement of the total amount of tonnage. This
statement will be found at page 277 of thefinan-
cial report for the last fiscal year. The registered
sail tonnage for 1790 is put down at 346,254; the
enrolled and licensed sail tonnage in another col-
umn at 132,123, and by a clerical error these two
sums are added together in the column of totals
as making only 274,377, as stated by the Sena-
tor. The actual amount is 478,377. This is blun-
der number one, and a very material one to his
argument.
He states in round numbers that the present ag-
gregate tonnage of the United States is 5,000,000,
adding 60,000 to make the numbers round. The
exact figures are 4,940,842, but tjus includes the
steam tonnage, amounting to 705,784. The Sen-
ator from Alabama resides some hundreds of miles
from the sea-shore, I believe, but he ought to be
aware that sailors are not required to man steam-
boats. The officers of steam vessels are engineers,
and the duty of the "sailors" is not to climb
ropes, but to heave coal or wood into the furnace.
If this class of persons are to be put upon our ma-
rine list, we may multiply it almost indefinitely
bygoing into our steam factories and workshops;
and I see no reason why hod-carriers may not be
added with equal propriety. Deducting the steam
tonnage from the aggregate, therefore as having
no more to do with the training of seamen than
the railroad tonnage, and instead of 5,000,000, we
have only 4,235,058. This is error No. 2, and a
pretty considerable one.
The Senator from Alabama assumes, in his
speech, that in 1790 the tonnage employed in the
cod fisheries was 31,842. He has not given us
hi^ authority for this statement. I find in a pub-
lic document already referred to, a document pub-
lished by the Treasury Department, Mr. Sabine's
report, that the tonnage employed in the cod fish-
eries was 28,348. This is error No. 3, and not
unworthy of notice.
Now, sir, with this corrected data, I will sub-
mit the results of my skill in arithmetic. The
total sail tonnage in 1790 was, as I have shown,
478,377; and, according to Mr. Sabine's report,
the tonnage of the cod fisheries at that period was
28,348. Instead, therefore, of the cod fishery ton-
nage being one eighth of the total in 1790, it was
only one sixteenth and six sevenths, or, in round
numbers, one seventeenth. The sail tonnage of
the present day, as I have shown, is 4,235,058;
and the tonnage employed in the cod fisheries is,
as he states, 104,573 tons. Dividing the greater
number by the lesser, and we have a quotient of
forty, or a proportion of one to forty, instead of
one to forty-eight, as stated by the Senator.
The Senator rounds off with the assertion—
Since 1790, the cod fMi tonnage has increased but three
fold. wlnle*the other tonnage of the United States has been
increased about tvventyfold."
Let us see. The cod-fish tonnage of 1790 was
28,348; that of 1857, 104,573, and the proportion
is as one to three and two thirds. The total sail
tonnage in 1790was478,377; the total sail tonnage
in 1857 was 4,235,058. The proportion is as one
to eight and five sixths. These are material
abatements from the sweeping assertion of the
Senator. The cod-fish tonnage has increased
nearly fourfold instead of three, as he states it;
while the total sail tonnage has increased less
than ninefold, instead of " about twenty."
Says the Senator:
" in 1804 the total domestic exports of the United States
weie §41,-107, -577, of which e\ported cod made $2,400,000;
at thib hme,Tlu' proportion it; a-< one to seventeen and two
tenths. In 1^7, however, the total domestic exports of the
United Slates weie ,>,336,985.065, of winch the value ofthe
c\poiied cod was but $.570,348; the propoition being about
as one to six hundred "
This is true; but it is also true that the increase
of population has, in the mean time, been four-
fold, and the facilities of internal transportation
have increased tenfold; and from these two causes
we may assume that the home market for fish has
increased fortyfold. The Senator underrates the
importance of the cod fisheries as a school for sea-
men, by saying that the number of seamen em-
ployed m them is insignificant, compared with the
whole number of the seamen of the United States.
He says:
"In 1790. the cod fbhermen comprised nearly half ofthe
whole number of Amcncan seamen; now. they comprise
not more than a thnteenth part; forwehaveovcr one hun-
ched and sixtj thousand seamen engaged in the mackerel
h-hery, m the whale fishery, m the merchant service, and.
the mihtaiy marine ofthe United States.'1
This is true ; but the Senator from Alabama
omits to state, what is the well-known fact, and
what a Senator from my State brought to the at-
tention of the Senate, namely :
"That something like three fourths of this formidable
number of seamen are feieigners, aliens, without any fixed
abode, while the cod fishermen are almost exclusively na-
tive-horn citizens
The law requires that at least three fourths of
them shall be American citizens. The whale
fishermen, on the other hand, are said tobealmost
exclusively foreigners. The Senator from my
State, alluded to, has discussed this branch of the
subject so fully, and presented it so ably, that I
deem it unnecessary to do more than allude to his
facts and arguments * He has produced the tes-
