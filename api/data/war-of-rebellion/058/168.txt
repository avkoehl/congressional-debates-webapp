HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., January 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON, Corinth:

Send in stores and Government property; then those dependent on us; then troops. Destroy all lumber and Government property that you cannot save and break up the post. Do this quickly.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, January 21, 1864.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Superintendent of repairs reports damage to road so serious as to delay us until to-morrow night before trains can pass.

Brigadier-General.

JANUARY 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON, Corinth:

My information is that Forrest and Chalmers are at Panola. Move all your valuables. Get your guns in condition to be run off. In case of necessity burn the lumber. Where do you learn that the enemy is, and from whom do you learn it?

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, January 21, 1864.

Major-General HURLBUT:

My information is from a citizen, who states that on Monday night a messenger staid at his house with a dispatch from Walker [?] to Roddey ordering him to join him on the road to this place. I do not place entire confidence in the report. If Forrest is still at Panila it is doubtless not true. I have scouts in that direction, but nothing from them. I doubt its veracity, but shall be ready in the event of an attack. The train was thrown off the track by a rail being taken up. I hope to be able to send off trains by morning. I think this taking into Memphis of the old lumber in the building here under the existing circumstances in not justified, in view of the delay and risk attendant upon it. It may all be done with safety, but I do not think its value, when sent to Memphis, is compensation for delay in the movement and possible interference of the enemy.

Brigadier-General.
