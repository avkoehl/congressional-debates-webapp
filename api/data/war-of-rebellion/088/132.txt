should, however, like to have advice on that subject. I have a detail of 1,000 men at work; I should like to have them returned at once. I shall move my command as soon as it gets ready. I understand about the wagons and artillery.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

Your order is confidential, but it cannot be executed properly unless I send staff officers to Point of Rocks to select such places for trains and artillery as may meet the order, which will give them an idea.

Commanding Second Corps:

It is ascertained that the enemy have re-enforced Early recently with three infantry divisions, Kershaw's and Field's, of Longstreet's corps, and Wilcox's, of Hill's corps, and Lee's division of cavalry, leaving only five divisions here. The commanding general directs that besides the rations and ammunition directed to be carried on the person you have six days' rations in trains and the ammunition required by recent orders.
