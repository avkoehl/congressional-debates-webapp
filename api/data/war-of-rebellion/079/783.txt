FLINT HILL CHURCH, October 2, 1864.

Lieutenant-General STEWART,

Commanding Corps:

Geral Hood directs me to inclose you this report* for your information. He thinks that it is probably a mistake as to the enemy's having one or two DIVISIONS at Big Shanty, as General Jackson's scouts destroyed a train this morning very near there, but he desires that you will move against Big Shanty with your entire corps, and, should you be able to take possession of the place you can then send a DIVISION to Acworth. There are some rumors of there being as much as a DIVISION of the enemy at Marietta; you will therefore keep in constant communication with General Armstrong, who will advise you of any movement from the direction of Marietta. The report of this force at Marietta General Hood considers an additional reason for your moving on Big Shanty with your whole corps. General Hood think by Tuesday evening you had better draw back by your right flank toward Lost Mountain.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General GOVAN,

Moore's Bridge:

General Hood desires me to say that you must keep in constant communication with Brigadier-General Iverson, that you may be thus informed of any movement of the enemy against Moore's Bridge. Should they move on this bridge with a serious force, sufficient to drive your command away, you must destroy the bridge, first allowing our wagon trains to get on this side the river. You must use your own judgment as to any force of the enemy that may move against you, and if [is] only desired to destroy the bridge when you you can hold it no longer. You must nor rely solely for information on the cavalry, but send some of your good men up the river on both sides as scouts, and keep out a picket up the river on both sides, to see that th enemy don't cross above you.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DARK CORNER, October 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood desires that you will keep in constant communication with our wagon trains hauling supplies to the army from Newnan, so hat they may have timely notice of any movement of the enemy which might endanger their safety and have time to get out of harm's way.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
