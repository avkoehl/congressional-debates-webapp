26th Cong.......2nd Sess.                                         Case of (he Caroline—Mr. Everett.                                                               H  of Reps.
waterfall of the St Lawrenc, where uve hundred
dollars would have built a complete «aw mil!, and
so in all other matters., and why? Because the
mother country did not countenance manu'actones
m Canada. It was the same policy which she had
pursued towards these States when co'omes, every
effort was made to stifle the genius and curb the
enterprise ot the people Manufactures of all
kinds were discouraged, and every thing was to be
precured from the workshops of the mother coun-
try. To foster and encourage her manufactures at
home—to find employment for her surplus popula-
tion—to afford her the means and art cles of traf-
fic, the policy was, as it now is, and ever will be,
to make her colonists believe that every article of
comfort, every instrument of art, and every ím-
ment of industry, could be made cheaper and bet-
ter in the mother country, and thus ihe colonists,
continuing the mere producers of the raw material,
should remain forever tributaries—tributaries to
an exaction from which no industry, no patient la-
bor, could relieve them.
Mr. J said he would not discuss the power c f
the Government to give protection, nor would he
dmcuss the policy ot such an exercise of power, it
was unnecessary, but reverting to what had oe
curred in the past history of this countiy, asd what
might be its future policy, he would remind gentle-
men, and particularly his Virginia fr ends, that ll e
first movement in reference to ihe encouragement
of domestic manufactures was from Virginia, and
that Mr. Mttdtson had urged it, as was shown by
his friend from New York, [Mr Monroe,] who
had read the preamble of the second law passed
by Congress, prepared and wntten by that s*ge
statesman; and he would further remind them irw
Mr. Jefferson, in 1816, m a letter to Mr Austin,
repudiated the views he entertained when the No is
on Virginia were fir,t pubi^hed, and advancing,
as he says, v. ah his country, declared ihaf, in be
independent for the conuorls of life, \u must fain i
cate them ourselves, we must place the rnanutic
turer by the side of the agricultural, nd, fuithcr,
that experxenae had tiught him that manufactures
are as necessary to our independence as to our
comfort.
Mr J said his own devotion to ih< interests of
the South rested on more than mrre piofessions,
and he had given iuch evidence-, of this as no out
would question He had but alluded to certain
facts and circumstances to admonish his Southern
friends not to force collisions that wee unneccs
sary, and to avoid excitements wh< tuhiy were un
productive of good in any quarter He had been
constrained, on more than one tecasion, to request
gentlemen from the Souih to speak fu themselves
and for their constituents, and not, in the bemvo-
lence of their nature, to take the whole South un-
der their especial charge. He was not annoyed,
but often amused, when some member from that
region rose and spoke as it he were armed with the
thunder of Jove, to threaten, command, or destroy
—when such member would draw the circle of the
Sooth as contraced as possible around himself, so
as to make himself the centre—the pecuhat repre-
sentative of the South It reminded him ot a
Mandarin m some Chinese circalar ba teiy, t hien
has bristling cannon pointed in every d rection, but
the commander, filled with apprehension on the
appearanceof the first sail, without waning to see
whether it be a harmless mercnan man or a ship
of war, erders a general fire, when a loud discharge
will ensue, the balls flying in every direction, sel-
dom reaching the enemy, and often doing great i  -
jury to friends around. He regretted to find that
members were anxious to draw a di¡, mction among
the Whigs—of Republican and National Republi
can Whigs He could perceive no beneficial ob
ject m it Such gentlemen snould remember that
General Jackson was a high tariff m r, Mr Van
Buren was also ultra on that questior A rd, if he
might be allowed to make the allusion to a gentle-
man who often alluded to him in debate, he -uould
say that, if he was not mistaken, the venerable
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Adams,] had
stated more than once on the floor that he was op
posed to the tariff bill of 1828, and only signed it
when President because he did not think it repub-
lican and proper to interpese his veto between the
rcpie-en'atives of the people and th" people toem"
selves Mr J was himself willing to share in the
censure, if any might 'o regard it, v ueh m.ght be
attached to those who had opposed Gen Jackson,
for he had never supported his pretensions to the
Presidency, for one moment, m thought, woid, or
deed, and could repose quietly on his pillow with
the reflection It was most tiue that he had rever
assailed his military reputation, for he never had
felt prouder than when, in his you'h, he had stood
upon the battle-field of New Orlea is—that field
wh re Gen Jackson bad won ha pioudest fame
He always iejoiced, as an Amei can, m Jackson's
martial renown, and wi hed th." chap et to be pe
rennial hicb he had won m arms and the savan-
nas and morasses of the South 'lb military re-
putation of such men was the pr >pei ly oi trie na-
tion, and he woulu b° the last to have it Uimshcd
Thus, when he thought an assault had b-en made
upon the reputation oi the Piesident elect, a few
days ago, he rebuked it, and the ardor of his feel-
ings muvt Lc his explanatun to the House fo¡ ih°
decided point of hisicmaiks on the occasion.
Mi J then took a rapid glance a ¡i «my qje -
ti ns which had been mttodjced in ihe di cussiin,
and, among others, the question of h tnbuting ihe
proceed ot the saleo of the puohcUt es among the
States
He said he would no di cu=s tn. question then,
unless the friends < f Ihe bill just -= tit rion the Se
nate, in relation to ¡i e emptu n and giauoalion,
snould be loried lo vote up n it, w¡ ic i 1 e did out

amerdment to (he pnpoiiim if thi gentleman

would be pleased if the friends ot that measure
would frankly sointoim n m, lot he would u e

his suit, he must be alnwed lo txpress dis eat
from tht wai m dsnuncnlion which had been m ide
igainst the pa pnety i f calling an extra ••es ion of
Congress He knew ihat aigument could be
urged both foi and against the measute, but it was
not the time 01 tie place (or discussion It was
tht busintss ot the Executive lo decide Ihe ques-

distant before such another blunder or act of teme
nty will be perpetrated Insiead of throwing him-
self upon the wisdom of Congiess, after making

"statu quo" doctrine, ne b" íeved, was not what
the Whi s had been contending for through a long
senas of anxuus years All biwress has been
standing stid long cueugh, and life, vigor, eneigy,
confidence, should be infused by wi e legislation
and decisive Executive action, that the in erests of
the whole country may advance, with renewed im-
pulse, to an enlarged prosperity
He was as much opposed to embarrass the Exe- I
cuuve which is quickly to super-ede the present, as
he «as. that the Executive should interfere ímpro-
p°ily with the legislative rights and duties of this
House He was as little devoted to Executive
power, influence, or patronage, as any one He
was glad that there had been a change of Execu
tive functionaries, but he could no>, like the moun-
tain Swiss, chime his merry anthem at the settieg
sun, nor, like the devout Persian, prostrate himself
before the rising That the leading measures of
the next Administra ion may be opposed by some
who have aided to bring it into power, it is but na-
tutal to suppose, b.t he believed that, si anxious
were the people to ^e a new order of things, of
men and measures, tnat m mj of the most zealous
in opposing the ejection cf Gen Harrison would
honestly yield their suppoit to such measures as
they might be convinced * on! i redouna to the be-

himself, at least, he would say, that he would
pause long and anxiously b fore he would take
any jtep oi position to embarra s the coming Ad-
ministration But, should a sense of public duty
even mike such a coui>e necessary, he iru-ted that
the evidence of tweive } ears' continued oppesition

party was proof enough that a long war neither
tired his patience nor subdued his energy He

REMARKS OF MR. EVERETT,
Or \EBVIUNT,
In the Ifñíise of Representatives,  Sdiurday,  February
13  1841—On Ihe  Repjrt  of the  Committee on
Foreign Relations
Mi Pickets having moved /lhat the tepoit be
la d on the table and orinted—i
Mr EVERETT slid tha/, as the report cm-
braced the case of ihe tari lilie a' well as that of
MiLeod, (which alona haá been submitted) he
should move to print all\th^ documents relating to
both cases They had been hetetofore published,
from time to time a^ crmjnuincaled to the House.
He desired to bring them togeth°i on this occasion,
to enable the House and the country duly to appre-
ciate the report, and the measures laken by the
Executive to preserve our neutrality He thought
that, since the affair of the Cirolme, every thing
had been done which the means uith'n the control
ot the Executive enabled it to do He then sent
to the Chan i list of the documents, (House Doc.
25th Coig 2d Sess Nos 64, 73, 74, frore page 25
to the end, 76, 302, and ot 26th Cong 2d Sess
No 31, of 28ih Dec 1840, and 4th Jan 1841, ihe
Neutrahty Act ot March 10, 1838, and the Presi-
dent's Proclamations of 5th Jan and 21^t Nov
183S,) which he aioved to have printed with the
report
[Mr GiunatR, Mr Pickens, and Mr Adams
took part in the debate on the report ]
Mr EVERETT said ttat, but for the remarks
of the honor ble chairman if ¡ue Committee on
Foreig i Affairs, he should not have taken part in
the debate He now felt >t due to himself, as a
dissentient member of tuai committee, to state, in
part, the gtounds o<" his di  ent
The report relates to matters of the gravest im-
port, and which are now the subject of diplomatic
discussiMn between the two Governments—a dis-
cussion confided by th" Corstimtion to the Execu-
tive He felt „reat embarrassment m debating sub-
jects ol this character and importance wth open
doors ft was difficu t, if not impossible, to do
fu'l justice to the subject, or to ourselves, without
danger of saying minis that should not be heard
beyond these walls I yield, said he, to the restraint
imposed by the time and the place I shall endea-
vor to say nothing that should not be heard by all.
In the committee-room there was no restraint.   I
