Corps, instead of the Twentieth. Should it meet General Thomas' approval, I would like him to telegraph to General Sherman requesting, through him, the War Department to make the change. I have no personal interest in it, but think it very desirable for the troops. It would gratify the pride and wishes of the Twelfth Corps, the greater portion, in fact nearly all, of the Eleventh Corps with the Twelfth in the wish. To the new division it is of course immaterial.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Bull's Gap, Tenn., April 14, 1864.

Captain G. F. HERRIOTT,

Commanding Left Wing, Third Indiana Cavalry:

SIR: You will send out a scouting party of about 100 men, under the guidance of Colonel Fry and Captain Reynolds, for the purpose of thoroughly scouting the upper end of Greene County, and, if it be possible, to capture the rebel desperadoes under Reynolds, who infest that county. The party of guides will be at your camp at 2 o'clock this afternoon, and your detachment will leave on their arrival. Should you prefer doing so, you can take the detachment yourself, in which case you will notify these headquarters who is left in command of your camp.
