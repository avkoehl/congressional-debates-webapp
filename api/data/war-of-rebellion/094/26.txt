HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, SEVENTH DIVISION,Edgefield, December 2, 1864.

Major-General WILSON,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Your order to march was received a few minutes since. I suppose, of course, you want me to get there as soon as possible. Our horses are very much tired, and have had nothing to eat since yesterday evening. It is now 12 m., and I think that by the time the horses and men are fed and the horses well cleaned and rested, it will be near night. Every exertion is being made to prepare, but men and officers are tired and sluggish. Gallation Ford is, I suppose, Gallatin Ferry, as a boat is used in crossing at all times of the year. Shall I destroy all boats in reach? I require fifty horses very much, and will feel obliged if you will order them to be given me. The quartermaster will do all he can to give them to me. I can fit our, I suppose, as well at Gallatin as here. My command requires more carbines, ammunition, and boots; these things, a day's rest, and some shoeing will make me all right. While I am writing the teams come in sight with forage and rations; I can, therefore, get away before dark.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-Will you please return answer by bearer as to whether I am mistaken as to the crossing, i. e., the crossing two miles and half from Gallation, on the Cumberland River. blacksmiths are at work.

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brigadier-General.
