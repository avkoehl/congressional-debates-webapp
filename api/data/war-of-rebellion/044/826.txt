Numbers 5. HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Baltimore Cross-roads, July 2, 1863 - 2. 30 a. m.

Major-General DIX, Commanding Department of Virginia:

GENERAL: Colonel Gibbs has come in to report that, about an hour ago, he heard artillery and other troops crossing the bridge on our right. As we are less than 5 miles from Bottom's Bridge, it is possible we are in a place where the enemy might get in our rear without our knowing it, and a disaster may, therefore, ensue unless I fall back. I am not well enough acquainted with the country to feel sure. I think, therefore, I will fall back with the main body to Baltimore Store, leaving an advance guard here. I do not think it advisable to venture too much, and, if you will send an immediate answer, I shall probably also withdraw the advance guard at daylight.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D KEYES,

Major-General, Commanding Fourth Corps.
