THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 11,
tion, and who might thereby be called upon to vote |
in order to support a particular party against their ¡
own predilections and principles' Although Mr j
W believed the viva voce mode of voting to be
the best among the people and the freest from i
fraud, as late events had pi oven, yet he could not
tolerate Jt here, as an engine of oppression and .
tyranny                                                                         ,
Mr DEOMGOOLE had no design in intro-
ducing the proposition of operating tyrannically j
upon the membeis of the House He had offered i
it because it was founded on correct principles,
and principles which had received and bore the |
sanction of his own State, and -which he under-
stood had also obtained sanction in several other
States. His only object was the establishment
of a general principle he believed to be correct in
the abstract, and necessary and essential in car-
rying out the great Democratic doctune of account-
ability He would ask if it was not the fair and
piopei mode that the conduct of the Representa-
tive should be fully spread befoie his constituents'
and he did hope that no Repiesentative would
oppose it because he wished to vote in ¡secret and
skulk from accountability, or because he desned
to conceal his conduct fiom his constituents, nor
was it with a view to any present purpose that
he had introduced it, and he should have offered
it before the election of Cleik, but foi the delay
that would have occuned in the organization of
the House He diewthe attention of his col-
league to the fact that the viva voce system pre-
vailed in Vngmia in all their elections, fiom that
of a constable upwards
Mr BRIGGS moved to stake out the words
" viva voce," and insert " by ballot " He said
he objected to the 01 lginal resolution, fiist, because
the dim voce mode was an inconvenient one, and
took up considerably moie time than that by bal-
lot, second, because it was an innovation upon
the uniform practice of the House for fifty yeais,
and, third, it was not so independent a mode as
that of the ballot
Mr PICKENS opposed the resolution, though
he held to responsibility to the fullest extent, so
far as legislative duties were concerned But
there was a wide distinction between the itspons-
lbility they owid to their constituents foi the
exercise of the law-making powei and that ot
choosing then meie ministerial officirs, and he
was yet to learn that he was responsible to lus
constituent for choosing this or that dooiktep'r,
this or that clerk In such cases, Mr F held that
he himself constituted a part of the constituent
body They w( re, in part, his oüVtrs, account-
able to him for thtir conduct, and not to the peo-
ple The converse doctune pushed, might be
carried tu \t into then boarding houses
But "Vfi P was inclined to doubt the policy of
that resolution upon othci and highei grounds
The excellence of the last few months had taught
him to diead a powei higher than their Execu-
tive, and moie tiuncndous in its operation—hi al-
luded to the power icpiesented by coipoiations
Pass that resolution, and this power will be
brought dne< lly to beai upon that House, and
when it is, goveinmcntil and i xecutivc influence
would be nothing compaied with it
Mr P admitted the general theoi y of the inde-
pendence of open voting, especially in Vnginia
and Ttnnessee, wheii the mass of the votéis aie
landholder, but go into otlui States wheie two
thuds of them were diifi rently situated, and i spe-
cially into the hrger cities, and, he would ask,
where would be the independence of the elective
franchise, if it weie expiessed via iocs with this
tremendous power brought to bear upon it' He
was opposed to the íesolution, and should vote
against it
The resolution was further opposed by Messrs
PEARCE ot Maryland, WISE, REED, SER-
GEANT, and  STANLEY, and  buppoited  by
Messrs  ROBERTSON, JENIFER, and S  W
MORRIS
Mr IILLINGHAST, with a view to effect
both objects, moved an amendment that the vote
should be taken by ballot, but each member
should inscnbe his name thereon
Mr STANLEY moved to lay the whole sub-
ject on the table, on which motion               , *
Mr DROMGOOLE demanded the yeas"and

So the House refused to lay the subject on the
table
Mi MONTGOMERY then rose, and said that
in view of the shoitness of the session, and the
masa of business befoie them, and believing no
Anther light could be thrown upon the subject,
for it had undergone discussion, from year to
year, for years back, he demanded the pievious
