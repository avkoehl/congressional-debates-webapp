[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded, with the remarks that Battery Wagner is as strong as it ever has been, and can resist both the land batteries and the fleet.

Should Sumter fall, however, can communications be kept open with this island? If it cannot, then the very scanty supply of stores here would soon be exhausted.

Could the enemy be kept from landing at Cumming's Point, and assailing us in the rear?

The enemy are rather near to be deceived by false guns. the desired result could be attained by masking the gun chambers.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

West and northwest scarp walls of Sumter badly shattered by reverse fire of enemy's 200-pounder Parrott guns and iron-clad fleet. Guns of those two faces not yet removed to Sullivan's and James Islands. Batteries are disabled. Gorge wall damaged, but still partially protected and supported by sand, cotton bales, and sandbags. Fall of Sumter now only a question of time. Batteries on Morris Island will necessarily follow in a few days. Am making all arrangements to meet emergency.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Can I not have the heavy Blakely guns on Gibraltar, just arrived at Wilmington? Great value defense of the inner harbor.

To serve guns in position and expected, shall need artillerists. Have drawn every man practicable from Savannah. Must ask for 500 artillerists from beyond department, with least delay practicable. Are Vicksburg men exchanged?
