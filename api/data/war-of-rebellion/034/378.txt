the remainder of the brigade to the front of the fortifications near Triune, where the enemy made his attack this morning. Was there formed in line upon the extreme left of the brigade, and were engaged in skirmishing with the enemy during the continuance of the action, which lasted until a late hour in the afternoon. Although my skirmishers were at times exposed to considerable heavy firing of the enemy, my regiment was fortunate enough to escape without loss of any kind whatever, and I have no casualties to report.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
