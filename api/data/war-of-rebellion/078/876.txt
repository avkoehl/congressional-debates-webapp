yesterday and to-day from cold produced by the damp weather. I fear I will soon be entirely unfit for duty in field. I will write you again in a few days, and will then send you copies of two of the reports you desire - that of all the transportation in the army and report of artillery horses. I fear we will be able to get you very little information about number of horses furnished Longstreet.

Very respectfully,

E. H. EWING,

Major and Inspector Transportation.
