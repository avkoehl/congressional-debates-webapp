In conclusion I beg leave to recommend the suggestion contained in my report to the Secretary dated 1st of August, 1862, and especially those in reference to the compensation of collectors in any future act that may be passed; that is, to allow them a given per cent. on such an amount collected, and a diminished per cent. on all sums beyond such amount, thereby offering a personal inducement for a close and rigid collection of all the taxes assessed.

Respectfully submitted.

T. ALLAN,

Chief Clerk of War Tax.
