Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

About a brigade of infantry is now moving on the Squirrel road, one mile left of lead-works, going toward our left. Another brigade of infantry has advanced from the enemy's works left of lead-works toward their front in woods, whit their right on the railroad. Considerable activity in all their camps.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1864-10 a.m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report quiet on my front during the last twenty-four hours. Yesterday afternoon the enemy advanced their picket-line across the corn-field and into the woods in my front. Cavalry vedettes were heard in the woods during the night. Patrols sent out at daylight report that the enemy have withdrawn their picket to the position held by the yesterday a.m. During their stay in the woods they blockaded the roads. I reported this morning operations in my rear.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1864-11.15 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

I have just returned from Ferrero's line. He has a good position. With the addition of another battery and a cavalry outpost which I have ordered to be furnished, the only weak point on my front seems to be the salient where the new work is building, on which the woods press too closely, and I have ordered out 100 ax-men to slam that down at once.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
