Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A strong party of the enemy, say 150 strong, landed at Legare's this morning from Folly River in small boats, and I fear have cut off the cavalry pickets. My dispositions have been made to drive them off or capture them.

SECESSIONVILLE, May 31, 1863.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy did not capture any of the pickets. He landed at Legare's but now, to all appearances, is leaving; some by boats down Folly River and some by Battery Island. We are trying to come up with them. One gunboat came up Folly River to Legare's place, and the large three-masted one is up Stono at Battery Island.
