Ninth. The rear guard of the troops executing these movements shall destroy all bridges and trestle behind them, adn railroads when possible.

Tenth. The troops concentrated at Saint Stephens' shall move to form a junction with the troops at Columbia or with the same at Chesterville, following one of three routes, according to the movements of the enemy, as follows:

First. Via Manchester and Kingsville to Columbia or Manchester, Camden and Brown's Ferry, on the Catawba, to Chesterville.

Second. Via Darlington, Kelly's Bridge, on Lynch's Creek, and Brown's Ferry, on the Catawba, to Chesterville.

Third. Via Cheraw, Chesterfield, Lancaster, and Brown's Ferry, on the Catawba, to Chesterville.

In view of the facility the enemy has at Branchville and Orangeburg and in the direction of Columbia, to cut the line of retreat of the garrison of Charleston, as above referred to, it becomes necessary to commanence the evacuation as soon as the necessary preparation can be made. The holding of Charleston is now reduced to only a question of a few days. Its loss does not jeopardize the safety of the State of South Carolina, but the loss of its garrison would greatly contribute to that end.

G. T. BEUAREGARD.

General.

For the information of the War Department.

AUGUSTA, February 15, [14?], 1865.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Columbia, S. C.:

GENERAL: All the cavalry reports of enemy's advance yesterday in this direction proved to be unfounded. The enemy has retired across the Edisto, and is reported moving toward Orangeburg. Cheatham's corps will move in the morning at 3 o'clock. He could not get ready to-day. General Hill has been quite nervous about the cotton, but is now quiet. Wheeler's cavalry has been committing outrages about Graniteville, and General Hill has sent an officer to investigate the facts. Major Wills will probably leave in the morning for Columbia.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
