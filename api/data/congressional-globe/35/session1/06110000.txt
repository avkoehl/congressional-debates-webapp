New Series....No. 1G7.
Stewart, Talbot, Vallandu?ham, Waid, White, Whiteley,
Wood, and Wortendyke—64.
So the resolution was agreed to as a part of the
amendment to the amendment.
Mr. BURLINGAME stated, during the call of
the roll, that he was compelled to be absent from
the House at the time his name was called, or he
should have voted m the affirmative.
The third resolution was then read, and agreed
to as a part of the amendment to the amendment,
as follows:
Resoloed, That the terms of sale adopted bv the agents!
appointed by tho Secrotaiy of Wai to make said sale, aie
disappioved of toi the reason-*, first: that a ciethf, unauthor-
ized bv law. wa< given to the puiehasord ; and second, that
tlii' ayht of po>*-r.--ton, alter the t-ale, reMM ved to the Gov-
ernment, wa< calculated to prevent afau sale at a fan price.
The fourth resolution was then read, as fol-
lows:
Resolved, That the evidence taken by tho select commit-
tee, appointed under authonty of the le^oimion of this
Hoiw, of January 4, 1856, he ti.xnsnnited to Use SecKtaty
o! Wat, to the end th;st. in conjunction wnli the Attorney
Genoiul oi the United State*, lie may adopt Mich mc.i-'iiins
in jexpect of the sale as they shall be of opinion, in ym*w
ot the fact? developed by such evidence, that the public in-
teie.-is jequire.
Mr, CLEMENS demanded the yeas and nays
on the resolution.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine, demanded tell-
ers.
Tellers were not ordered.
The resolution was agreed to.
The SPEAKER. The question now recurs
upon agreeing to the resolutions of the gentleman
from New York, as an entirety, in lieu nf the (wo
icsolufions ojfered by the gentleman from Vir-
ginia, [Mr. Faulkner.]
Mr. CLEMENS. Upon that I demand the
yea*and nays.
Mr. STANTON. I supposed that those reso-
lutions had been adopted as a substitute for tiie
resolutions of the gentleman from Virginia.
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not so state.
The Chair stated that the vote would first be
taken on the resolutions of the gentleman from
New York serhdnn, and that the vote would then
be taken on such of the resolutions ns the Mouse
might adopt, as an amendment to the lesolutmns
offi led by the gentleman from Virginia. It was
in that way only that a vote eould be obtained,
as the House desired, upon each of the reso-
lutions.
The Chair will be permitted to say further, that
if the House agrees to the resolutions of the gen-
tleman front New Yoi k as a substitute for the res-
olutions of the gentleman from Virginia, the ques-
tion will then reeur between the amendment thus
amended, and the resolutions reported by the ma-
jority of the committee. If the proposition of the
gentleman from New York shall be voted down,
then, under the understanding of the House, a
separate vote may be had upon the two resolu-
tions of the gentleman from Virginia; and th-m the
question v.'i 11 be presented between the prop, wit,:on
of the gentleman ftom Virginia as an etuuety and
the ongmal piuposition. If the resolutions of the
gi. mieman from Virginia are voted flown, then
the House can have a separate vote upon each of
the original resolutions.
Mr. GROW. We are to vote now on substi-
tuting the resolutions of the gen ties nan fiom New
Yoik for the entire ^solutions of the giutleman
from Virginia.
The SPEAKER. That is the question. The
proceeding is an unusual one; but, as the Chair
sUU'-d this morning, it is the only way in which
a sepatate vote could be had upon all the resolu-
tions.
Tho question was taken; and it was decided in
the affirmative—yeas 116, nays 86; as follows:

So the amendment to the amendment was agieed i
to. j
Pending the eall of the roll, j
Mr. M( )1MUS, of Permsvl vanm, sIm ted that his 1
colleague, Mr. Co^jik,, was absent fiotn the1
House m consequence of a death in his family. 1
Mr. GiLM-VSl" stated that lie had paired oil 1
with Mr. 1
Mr. ATKINS. I voted upon the resolutions !
offered L>v the gentleman from New York as an '
expression of opinion upon the whole tiansric.uon. |
I understand that the last resolution propost.aan I
expression of opinion upon the part of the House '
as to the proper course to he pursued in reference !
to this sale. As the President and Cabinet can take 1
chaige of this matter and prosecute it if they do- ,
sue to do so, feeling that il would be an improper
msli ucuoii, I therefore change my vote,and vote
" no."
The question then recurred upon the amend-
ment as amended; or, in other words, between the
pioposmon of the gentleman from New Yoik
[Mr. ClahkJ and the resolution reported by the
com mittee.
Mr. FAULKNER. Can T, by the consent of
the gentleman from New York, and by tho unan-
imous consent of the House, have an amendment 1
plaeed at the end of the last resolution, so as to
make it the duty of the Attorney General and Sec-1
retary of War to report to this House.-'
The SPEAKEfl. })y unanimous consent. ;

Mr. IjAilivSDALE. Is the question now be- !
tween the resolutions reported by a majority of ■

The SPEAKER. It is. I
Mr. RUUvSDALE. Well, sir, 1 am opposed 1

So the amendment, as amended, was not agreed
to.
Pending the eall of the roll,
Mr. BURNETT said: 1 am opposed to the
resolutions of the gentleman from New York,
but prefei them to those of the committee, and.
shall therefore vote " ay."
Mr. SAVAGE. If the proposition of the gen-
tleman from New York fails to be adopted as a
substitute, what will be the next question?
The SPEAKER. The resolutions proposed
by a majority of the committee.
Mr. SAVAGE. I shall then vote " ay."
Mr, DAVIS, of Mississippi, As everybody
is making explanations, I desire to ask whether,
if I vote '*no"and the substitute is lost, 1 then vote
against the resolutions repoi ted by the committee
and they are lost, if there will be anything be-
foie the House >
The SPEA KRR. The Chair thinks not.
Mr. PEYTON. 1 desire to know, if the report
of the committee be voted down, and the resolu-
tions of the gentleman from New York be voted
down, whether theie will be anything before the
House ?
The SPEAKER. Upon further consideration,
the Chair thinks that the repoitof the committee
Will remain undi.>posf d of.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I desire simply to
say, that 1 vote between these two propositions
as a choice of evils.
Mr. BURNETT. Upon further consideration,
I cannot vote for the last resolution of the gentle-

I therefore change my vote, and put it " no."
