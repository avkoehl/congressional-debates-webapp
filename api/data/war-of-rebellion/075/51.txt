HUNTSVILLE, May 6, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Ringgold, Ga.:

Telegram just received from General Stevenson reports that Roddey is still in his front, tries to drive in his pickets, yet without success. Supposed to be no other force but Roddey there. General Gresham was at Clifton on the 30th. He should move down I think. Guerrillas are getting troublesome between Flint River and Larkinsville, but have done no damage; will prevent them if possible. Will keep you advised of any movements I can discover.

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant C. L. WHITE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Peter Whitecotton, with an unknown force, perhaps 100 men, is on our side of the river. I propose to attack him to-morrow, unless the general disapproves. I propose sending Colonel Wever with 175 men, via Larkin's Landing, to Guetersville, and Colonel Happel, from Woodville, with 175 men to Gutersville. Can you send fifty cavalry by to-night's train to report to Colonel Happel? Please answer immediately.
