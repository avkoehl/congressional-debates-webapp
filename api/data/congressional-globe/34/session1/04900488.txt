procure a copy of the Rules and JeffcisonV Manual to be
printed for the use of the members, to he neatly bound,

Mr. STEPHENS. A similar resolution has
already been passed this session.

fact, and therefore withdraw the resolution.
Mr. PORTER, by unanimous consent, intro-

withdrawal of papers.
Mr. SWOPE. I ask the unanimous consent of
the House to withdraw from the files the petition
and papers in the case of Samuel Perry, in a
matter of claim against the Government for the
transportation of Indian supplies.
Mr. LETCHER. 1 object.
Mr. SWOPE. I am sure the gentleman will
not object when I state that the object I have in
view is to present the papers to the Court of
Claims.
Mr. PHELPS. The gentleman can do that
under the resolution which has been passed to-
day.
Mr. SWOPE. The case is not pending there
at all.
Mr. LETCHER. I want to know the reason
for allowing the privilege. We have already
passed a resolution to give these papers to the
clerk of the Court of Claims in certain cases.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is informed that
the order of the House does not cover this case.
Mr. GREENWOOD. The only objection to
granting this general leave is the fear that we
may be giving that court some jurisdiction thereby,
which is not conferred upon it by the law of its
organization.
Mr. SWOPE. I do not ask to have the papers
referred. I ask for leave to withdraw them,
merely.
Mi*. LETCHER. Then I understand the papers
are to be withdrawn for the purpose of giving the
parties the opportunity of presenting them at the
Court of Claims, or to the House again, as they
may think proper. Well, sir, I have been on the
Committee on Claims, and I know what difficul-
ties have arisen out of just such proceedings on
thepart of the House as we are now asked to take.'
Members have obtained leave to withdraw papers'
from the files of the House; the parties have as-
certained upon what grounds they have lost their
cases before the Committee on Claims; they have
revised the papers, so as to remove the difficulty;
and have again presented them in a shape by
which their cases were made out. That is precise-
ly the reason why I object to the gentleman's
request now to withdraw, unconditionally, these
papers.
Mr. SWOPE. I am willing that copies of the
papers shall be left on file, i ask leave to with-
draw them with that understanding.
Mr. LETCHER. If you will take copies and
leave the original papers, I have no objection.
Mr. SWOPE. No, sir. Mr. Speaker, I am
very much surprised at the objection which has.
been raised by my friend from Virginia to the
application for leave to withdraw these papers
from the files of the House. I will withdraw my
application, hoping that the gentleman from Vir-
ginia will look into the case and satisfy himself
of the propriety of the request.
I now ask leave to withdraw from the files the
letter addressed by General Hull to Captain
Wallace.
There being no objection,leave was granted.
CLERK TO THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN
AFFAIRS.
Mr. PENNINGTON. I ask leave to offer the
following resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Foreign Affairs be au-
thorized to employ a clerk, at the usual rate ot'compensation,
for such time as they may deem necessary.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I move that the
House do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to, and thereupon (at
fifteen minutes before four o 'clock) the House ad-
journed until Monday next, at twelve o'clock, m.
