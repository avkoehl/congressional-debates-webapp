HEADQUARTERS,Near Richmond, Va., June 5, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I wrote to His Excellency the President this morning about re-enforcements for General Jackson.* The troops from Georgia you propose sending him I believe form a part of General Lawton's brigade. I wish they were mine, but with the North Carolina battalion, if they can join him, will fill up his ranks. He ought to have more, or these will not materially aid him. His plan is to march to Front Royal and crush Shields. It is his only course, and as he is a good soldier, I expect him to do it.

I telegraphed yesterday to Major Harman, at Staunton, to collect all the troops in that vicinity, raise the community, magnify their numbers, and march down the valley and communicate with Jackson. It will shake Shields and make him pause.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General.

DREWRY'S BLUFF, VA.,

June 5, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

There is a battery of boat howitzers, commanded by Captain Young, doing nothing at Petersburg. It would be very serviceable here to place upon the hill in rear of Drewry's Bluff.

General J. G. WALKER,

Commanding Brigade at Drewry's Bluff, Va.:

GENERAL: I am very desirous that you should have your whole brigade on this side of the river, or at least be prepared to join the regiments now here at the shortest notice. It is equally important that the safety of the battery at Drewry's Bluff should be secured. I have written to General Ransom at Petersburg to know his strength and whether he could not cover the works at Drewry from parties landing from the river. He will probably visit Drewry, and I desire you to give him all information, and let me know whether you cannot with propriety bring your regiments that are with you to this side. Is the bridge of boats serviceable?

Your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
