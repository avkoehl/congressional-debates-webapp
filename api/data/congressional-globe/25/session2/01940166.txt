this. Here a loss by a deposite and by a disburs-
ing officer had been sustained, and the money had
been two years in his hands If the $,K 0,000 only
had been given, there would still have been a loss
of $20,000, but while the hands of this agent were
already overflowing with the public money, the
Government m April gave him ¿50,000 more, and
the period, it would be recollected, was a very cri-
tical one with the banks Why take this large
sum of money out of the Treasury, and put it on
deposite in the hands of any public agent* It might
be necessary to sustain the bank, but could not be
necessary to sustain the officer He was already
flooded with money, which he could not expend,
■when the $50,000 were added And theie Was a
loss now by this bank of $70,000 If things n ere
managed in this way, Mr C did not see occasion
for a Sub-Treasury bank, or any bank at all It
seemed as if this required some lemedy
Mr BUCHANAN said that, at this rate, to bor-
row the language of the Senatoi from Kentucky,
(Mr Crittenden,) we had very great occasion for
a Sub-Treasury. He had watched the progress
of the discussion on this Commonwealth Bank af-
fair, and it appeared to him that if any arguments
were wanting to prove the necessity of dn orcmg
the Treasury from banks as fiscal agents, what
they had heard in relation to the proceedings ol
this bank was conclusive Audi alteram partem
had always been a maxim with him, and the refore
he would not at present pronounce any opinion
with regard to the management of that institution,
or to the conduct of the Treawiry Depnttnent,
in advancing to it deposits of public money to
meet the present pensions He was glad the mo-
tion had been made to refei the subject to the
Committee on Finance, because, by this means,
justice would be done to all parties But as long
as the late system of depositing the public funds
continued, there would always be the same com-
plaints that were now made Place the power m
the hands of the Secietary of the Treasury to depo-
sit and withdraw the public funds as his discretion
may dictate, and suspicion, jealousy, and distrust,
will always follow lies proceedings, whether they be
right or wrong, and if any future Secretary should
be dishonest—if he should desire to use the public
money to elevate himself to the high places of the
nation, the country could never be sale with such
a power m his hands
After all the clamoi which had been raised
against the Independent Treasui\,it was only a
simple measure to receive from the public debtors
the amount they owe, to keep it safely in the custo-
dy of our own responsible ofheers, and to pay it out
again to those to whom we are indebted, without
the agency of such banks as ihat of the Common-
wealth
It had been said of this bank, that it had loaned
out alt its money to its own directors
Mr. WEBSTER said he had heard this, but did
not state it as of his own knowledge
Mr BUCHANAN continued He feaied that,
on investigation, other bank  would be lound to
have acted in a similar manner If «aid he, you
want to save the public money foi th u e of the
people, and prevent it from becoming the msim-
ment of Executive influence, )ou must keep it
j ourselves, under the control of the ,aw, until it is
wanted for the public sei vice
He was sorry any ihmg had been said in the pub-
he newspapers that rendered it necessary, m the
opinion of the Senator from Massachusetts, to e't-
fend himself on that floor lie thought it bad po-
licy for a member of the Senate to come here and
defend himself against newspaper attacks, foi if he
did, he would be almost certain to get the worst of
the bargain And whether a member was inno
cent or not, he thought it better for him to leave
his defence to his friends out of doors After all,
no charge had been made against the Senatoi from
Massachusetts, affecting either his honor or his in-
tegrity We had nearly all, perhaps, been under
protest at some period of our lives, by accident, or
irom inability to meet our pecuniary engagements
on the very day they became due Surely this
was no crime
With respect to the advances to the Common-
wealth Bank, spoken of by the Senatoi from Mas-
CONGRESSIONAL OLOJ|E.
sachusett-., he Ulieved >t would turn out to be
nothing more than this the Secretary of the Trea-
sury, hating the unlimited control over the funds
of the Government, has thought« just to place a
certain portion of them, in advance, on deposite, to
meet the accruing demands of the pensioners But
the Secretary of the Treasury ought w have no
such power, and he entirely concurred with the Se-
nator from Massachusetts in the opinion that no
emolument m the me of the public funds should
be given to the pension agents, or any other agents
under the Government But this was the fault of
the s^stem, not of the Secretary. We should keep
our mom.) ourselves, and pay it out to the public
eiednois when due them, and then we should hear
no such complaints
Mr CLAY said this incidental debate was a
little unexpected by him, but as it has come up,
said he, I will Kce the 'opportunity to say a few
words The Senator (Mr. Bccbanin) says that
these astounding disclosures, for so I regard ihem,
afford satiMaetory proof of the necessity of adopt-
ing the Sub-Treasury system, alias the Qmtrtontat
Bank of the United States, which is now before
the Senate And whit is it he tells us now of the
faionte system wh eh was idopted in 1834, and
ol « hich he was then and since the strenuous nd-
\ ocate1 He say-i now it is dangerous, and the
St nitor Irom Connecticut (Mr Nuis) says it is
couup nig, ind tint it is not thought worthy of
confidence But whv this discrepancy? Whi,
when tin member and his filends had rejected a
sjstem an J in instituti >n which fur near half a
cen ur> h id i ikt-n care of the public money with-
out the loss of a single cent—why, when that faith-
ful institution h is discarded, did they resort to this,
which he now calls unsafe and corrupting? Sir,
having found that the sjstem which they adopted
three jear-, ago Ira failed,they are now forgiving
us anotliei ol their prescriptions, which we must
tike from these sime doctors, although their for-
mer proscription failed, which was the grand
cilholicon in 1814 And in thiee jeais more,
they will call tins new system, which they now
want to foiee upon lis, just as unsaft an I corrupt-
ing is the forme r
Sir, who an these Sub Tnasiirers, and what
sitisfac'ion li in w that they will b  angels, pure,
futhlul, ml tin lys aetiug with fidelity an ' ad-
vantage to thr finances of thecountr)? If rum r
does not inismfoim us, we are already in the w ly
to lose in Hit ns n the hinds of individuals And
will th sun ndi\ duals do bettei under this new
system' No, su, under no system «hatevei, and
some Ihrte ve -, hence we shall find those who are
now denouncing then own experiment, again de-
nouncing this their other experiment Sir, I ask,
how can you expoct that an individual shoulel have
hall a million of the public money in his hands,
without danger of his helping himself or his
fi lends at the publu expense? When this new
experiment shill provea failure, as fail it will, if
we adopt it, we shall then have some other experi-
ment to delude and deeeive the credulity of the
Amern in people One me no more of these
Sub-Treisury cl em «, no more of these experi-
ments, diese nos turns
Su, (said \li C) when I entered the Senate
this miming m> eais vu re delighted with a sound
w hich came from a cjinrter quik unexpected The
b nitor (Mr Gi i mjv) ¿ot up, with his instruc-
tions in his hand, an ' ma manly manner declared
that he would eonlorm to those instiuction> Sir,
I hope they will be conformed to by others in this
Seinte Some rf my fnends do not hold that th y
are bound to obi y such instructions, and they
theretore acted with perfect consistency—declined
to conform to them I (said Mr C ) am among
the number who, with certain qualifications, do
hold to the doc rme of instruction Let those who
holl to the doctrine act consistently Let instruc-
tions come, and I hope, if the Senator from Penn-
sylvania receives his he will be guilty of no eva-
sion, but meet them "-old'i, m 1 cither obey them,
or resign and „o home in 1 le te his place  o one
tint will confoim \nl the Senater from New
Ye r'r,'oo, if am not mis nforned, \ \ u\ he was
aol eel what was to be (tone in ¡elation to his col-
league, up! td, .¡Jiuct him,, if I .incorrectly in-
formed, such was his laof nage. I hope the in-
structions will come, and eome I am confident they
will, from that source-whtch gentlemen of the party
say they are bound to obey—-frota me people and
the representatives of the people And Virginia,
too; but, sir, I believe the party there is a hung
jury; however, at the next election the people will
order a eenire <fe neuo against the Sub-Treasury
And in th* State fiom which the Senator (Mr
Grcn y) this morning presented the resolutions, m
the Legislature of that Slate the instructions were
adopted by a majority approximating to unanimity
In the Senate of that State there 18 to 7, and m
the House of Representatives 39 to 19—39' the
Mosaic law—loity save one—and very properly
applied to such a systsm as this Sub-Treasury ,
project And the great leading State of the West,
that State to whose opinions we are all disposed to
bow with respect—she, too, dee lares her opinions
in very intelligible language How will her Sena-
tors act? Sir, I will answer for myself, that it
instructions come from the Legislature of my State
against the  Sub-Treasury schsme, I pledge my
word that I will conform to them    (A laugh )
On the whole («lid Mr C ) I think the Senator
Irom Pennsylvania can diaw no eomlusions ot
comfort fiom these transactions at Boston It ap-
pears to me, on the contrary, that this system
which three yeais ago was to give perfect security
to the public money, and to give u«, too, a far bet-
ter currency, having tailed, I think, when the Sub-
Tieasury comes to replace it, millions will be lost,
where one dollar was lost even by that now ex-
ploded system
Mr WRIGHT observed that his purpose m
rising was piinctpally to remove from the honora-
ble Senator fiom Virginia the embarrassment in
which he was placed by this incidental discussion
We seem, said Mr W to be passing into what
may become a protracted incidental debate , and
having had his speech, on repeated occasions,
suspended in the same way that the gentleman's
now was, he would not himself prolong the discus-
sion lie hid, however, one word to say in reply
to the Senitoi from Kentucky, met he would not
say tint word if it was not a peisoinl affair to him-
self, md wtess.T to give a refutation to the un-
lomiile'd report wlu< h hid found its way into some
of the newspTpers, ot some remarks of his in refer-
ence to lus e league He Was obliged, therefore,
to the Si n tor Irom Kentucky for bring ng this re-
jiort before him, for, as it was not his habit to en-
ter into conflict with the editors of newspapers, he
had not before an opportunity of giving the report
a public refutation He would now, therefore, say
that the whole story was entirely false from begin-
ning to end If he had ever (lone his colleague,
personally or politically, any unkind aet, it was
wholly unintentional and without his knowledge
He knew that it had been reported, anl he believed
he had seen the report, that, on lus passage home
from this place in October last, he drew up resolu-
tions to instruct his colleague, but he toek the
occasion to say that the whoh milter was abso-
lutely false He now asked the Senate to pass
over the question before them, in order to allow the
Senator from Virginia (Mr Rivis) an opportnmty
of going on with his argument on the Sub Treasury
bill
Mr FRLsTON moved lo lay the subject under
di cu^sion on the t ible
Mr BUCHAN4N was agreed to the motion
wnh regard to the position of the Senator from
Vugmia, (Mr Rivjs,)but, as he always endea-
vored to pay his debts piomptly, he had rather do
so now
The ejuestion was then taken on Mr Prison's
motion, an 1 it wih carried
The Independent Treasury bill was then liken
up  when
Mr RIVES resumed his speech begun \c-ter-
pay, md concluded, aftei occupying the fljor ml
near 4 o' lock
Mr HUBBARD intimated hw nt-nti in to ad-
dress the Senate on the subject, and submitted an
imcndm nt to amend the text of the bill pro-
\ ldtng that all payments to be made from (he Trea-
suiy Department, shall be by the drafts of the
Treasurer ot the United  States, upon wairant*
