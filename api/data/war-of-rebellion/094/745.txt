hauling the ordnance and commissary stores. These arrived here this evening. I started one of these this morning at daylight to Wytheville for the suppose of procuring horse-shoes and nails, of which we are very much in need. Lieutenant Carrington, the brigade ordnance officer, went ahead yesterday to see to procuring them if possible. I understand from him that he has now with the brigade here some ninety rounds of ammunition tot he man, making two good wagon loads. I have two commissary wagons also, intended to haul a supply of aslant and meal. The horses have improved very much in the few days rest, and everything is ready to move, subject to your written orders and instructions. By making easy marches the wagons to Wytheville after horse-shoes, &amp;c., would, be able to overtake us very soon, and the barefooted horses shod at the country shops on the line of march. I understood from Colonel giltner that I was to await the arrival of the wagons, &c., and inform you of my readiness to move and await your order. I have the honor now to do so. We have pretty well fed out the surplus grain, &c., in this neighborhood, and when compelled to move on account of forage I shall move west, in the line I presume the brigade will pursue when ordered. The members of the brigade who were left with disabled horses have, may of them, assailed under Lieutenant Garrard, of Fourth Kentucky, at Charles Smith's, in Russell. I sent an officer this morning to collect them and all other absentees together, and take them, by Lebanon, to Little Moccasin Gap, at Hanson's. I understand from the wagoners who returned to-day that none of our wagons, teams, or loads were lost-that is, none belonging to Giltner's brigade.

Hoping to hear from you by return of courier, I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. L. PRIDEMORE,

Colonel, Commanding Giltner's Cavalry Brigade.

P. S. - Please send all mail coming to this brigade; some of it may be directed to Cosby's brigade.
