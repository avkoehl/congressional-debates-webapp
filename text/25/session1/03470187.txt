25th CoifG....lst Sess.                               Making public officers depositories—Mr. King.                                                  Senate.
tions above, and had used round numbers, but no
use of authentic materials could vary the result
more than a mere fraction, and stnct accuracy
would most likely make the comparison more un-
favorable to the statement of an equal expan-
sion in the two countries during the period re-
ferred to.
Instead ef equality, then, we had, for Eng-
land, an increase in the entire estimated cur-
rency of the nation of about one-third of one per
cent,
In the United States, an increase of about ninety-
four per cent,
In England, an increase of paper currency of
about one and a half per cent,
In the United Stales, an increase of about ninety-
six per cent
So much (said Mr King) for an equal expansion
of the currency in both countries. As to the
" other credits," they were not tangible, but every
man of any observation must know that on this
item we should suffer in the comparison inore than
in th« other Credits were certainly multiplied in
England, in some districts, by the increase of the
number of joint-stock banks, by which new con-
nections were formed, and the number of checks,
drafts, &c. increased. But the increase of joint-
stock banks (deducting the private banks melted
into them) bears no comparison to the increase of
banks in this country, as we find from official
statements The consequent increase of credits,
though they can not be ascertained with precision
in either country, may be compared by the result
The increase of credit m England has been based
on the same national cash capital, as appears by the
unchanged quantity of the currency, as exhibited
by the tables. And that it has not been redundant,
is unanswerably proven by its having produced no
general speculative rise ol prices To speak of a
redundancy of currency or credit, when no specu
lative r>se in commodities has taken place, is per-
fect nonsense Where facts have been stated and
not proved, I have taken issue, and disproved
them by facts fully established Where facts are
conjectured, I will presently introduce evidence to
prove the conjectures groundless, by pr«vmg the
absence of consequences invariably connected with
them. The only way in which a redundancy of
currency or ciedit depreciates foreign exchange, is
by producing a speculative rise in prices, and a
consequent over-trading England has not over-
traded , on the contrary, she has exported more
than she imported, and left us enormou-d) in her
debt But, whilst she had a large balance against
us, exchange was agmn*t her, and making a con-
tinual diamupon her bullion! This strange finan-
cial and commercial anomaly, so embarrassing to
the English, I will hereafter expla n, after having
completed the proof on the first proposition
He then read the evidence of Mr Gurney, a man
of so mueh intelligence and authority on these sub-
jects as to be called before the joint stock bank com-
mittee lately appointed by parliament This wit-
ness shows remarkable intelligence on the subject
oí finance, but is here strangely embarrassed for
want of facts, of which he seems entirely ignorant.
[Here Mr K lead the evidence of Mr Guiney as
follows ]
Evidence of Mr Gin ney before the Committee of Joint
Stock Banks
Q, 3592 Has there been any change of late in
the State of the London money marker*
There ha* been a g-adual increase m the value cf
money
Q 3594 To what do you attribute that altered
state of the monev market in London'?
One cause has been the exportation of bullion to
foreign countries, but I apprehend the w un cai«e
is, the circulating medium existing in Europe anil
the m&canlüc pails of Jimerica (') is not incieased
in proportion to the transactions, and that the same
quantity of circulating medium, or, perhaps, even
a reduced quantity, has to perform a much laiger
amount of transactions
Q 9595 Would not the effect of it, if owing to
that to which you have alluded, be rather indicated
in a fall in the money prices of commodities'*
That is the tendency 0} it, but there are conflict-
ing causes that have marvellously mamtamel (not
increased) the valueof commodities generally
Mr Gurney is a bill broker, who procures the
discount or rediscount of country bills in th«* Lon-
don market He was, therefore, well acquainted
with the facts, and the subject on which he speaks,
so far as England was concerned, and he tells us
that "the value of money had gradually increased "
And in another part ol bis evidence he tells us that
the increase is about 20 percent He knew this as a
fact, and in England he u as enabled, in some mea-
sure, to account for it, for he knew that currency
had not increased, whilst, from the progressive in-
crease of national wealth, commodities and tiansac-
hons had He could, therefore, account for the
depreciation of exchange, and export of gold to
America, on no other supposition than that the cur-
rency of the ' commercial parts of America" was
even more contracted and disproportioned to eom-
modites than in England But why was not the
appreciation of money "indicated by a fall m the
money prices of commodities'" Though this was
the natural "tendenc)," "conflicting causes mar-
vellously maintained prices" What were the
conflicting causes referred to by Mr Gurnet Evi-
dently the "increased activity in the manufactur-
ing districts" by the increased demand for the pro-
d nets of English labor for American consumption
The depreciation of commodities by the appi eciation of
money was counteracted by an appreciation of com-
modities by an ma eased demandJor them Though
the ideas of Mr Gurney seem clear he seems for
want offsets, to be involved m embairassment and
apparent contradiction That th  value of money
was íaised in England b\ an insufficiency in quan-
tity, was inconsistent with the exportation of srold,
unless m Ameuca, also the currency  ?<■ contnet
ed And yet a conliaction of the currency in /¡mé-
lica was inconsistent with our increased demand for
English manufactures Had the witness, however,
known that, so {at from a contiaction, our cur-
rency had expanded near 100 per cent and that
exchanges were in our favor whilst there was a
large balance against us, that we were draining
them of their gold in defiance of this heavy debt
and redundant currency, his embarrassment would
have increased, until he ascertained that we were
performing all these commercial miracles under a
new system of finance, by which we exchanged
our credit for their capitil, and, after going m debt
for a large commercial balance, borrowed a still
greater amount, and thereby turned the exchanges
against them by be rowing tneir own money
Mr K further sustained his piopositnn, and
stiengthened his evidence upon ihis point by intro-
ducing official tables from England of some of the
principal alucies of raw produce for English manu
factures, &c enteied for home consumption, and
the official and declared valuation of exports, both
embiacmg the peí lod m question, except the official
% aluation for 1837_, which he had not been able to
obtain

by Mr  Kino

By the above official tables, Mr K said it would
clearly appear that the nat onal wealth and indus-
try had greatly increased, whilst the currency had
remained about stationary, as previously established
Mr. K. thought he had now fully established that
the cuirercy of England had not been equally ex-
panded with our own, but on the contrary there
had been actually "a giadual increase m the value
of money "
The second proposition (Mr K said) scarcely
needed p'roof, fiom its close connection with the
fust He would put the matter at rest, however,
by the production of evidence that ought to be satis-
factory to all This evidence was the perfect agree-
ment, on this point, of Mr IIorsl y Palmer and
Mi Know ] s, in their controversy concerning the
action of the |oint stock banks and the conduct of
the Bank of England Mr Palmer, in apologizing
for the contraction t f the bank, and alluding to the
causes, etc says " it is necessary to state these, as
they seem, in no degree, to have arisen from over-
trading or any undue speculative adiance in commer-
cial prices " Mr Know les, however, is not satisfied
with this admission, but wishing the fact established
beyond doubt, he asserts the same thing, and refers to
the proofs Mr Iu owlea, after prowng that the
legitimate demand for cu-rency had been increased
by the increase of nationa' weahh, siys " „# table
of p? tees, had I time to prepare one, would prove
beyond question that so far from a nie in prices gene-
rally, in many cases there has been 1 fall, even with
decreasing stock, a fact quite incompatible with an
over issue and depreciation of the currency While,
again, where a ri'-e 111 prices has takei plice, tí is
distinctly referable to causes prospectively affecting the
1 la? ket as to supp'y " Some fluctuations w ere doubt-
le s exhibite I in the manufacturing d sfiirts in par-
ticular articles, and espeeiall in art cles for Ameri-
can consumption, wh eh, from the 1 eavy increased
denial J for them, could not be r'vdi'y «upp led by
existing establ shments This, hoiever, "is dis-
tinctly refernble to causes affecting the market as
to supply," and was no evidence of a redundancy
of the circulation The distinction might always
be settled by an observation of the following rules
fhit whenever there is a great fluctuation in the
value of a part cuhr irticle rr commodity, whilst
the value of the property of the country generally re-
mains unaffected, we may take it for granted that
the fluctuation is owing to a change in the relation
between the demand and supply Tor instance, if
there be a short crop of corn, the «upply will fall
short of the demand and the price oí corn will rise,
whilst all other commodities nai smd firm This
n^e is occasioned by the change m the relation
between the supply and demand But if we find
the price of e\ery commodity raised to an unusual
elevation, (as lately in the United S ates,) we may
take it for granted ihit the price is ow mg to the
change in the relation betwe n cmencj and com-
n odities, m otner w ords, that currency or credit,
or both, has been grea'ly increased and, conse-
quently depreciated This partial and local fluctua-
tion, then, where it exsteJ, amounted to nothing,
3a it was trifling and parti tl, and att lbuttd to a
fltcf ilion between snpph md dem-nd—a fluc-
tuation to be found to some extent in all countries,
and at all times Doubtless some additional ac-
tivity was occasioned bj 0111 artificial and credit
dtmind for manufactures, attended also with an
inciease of manufacturing stock It wis very

stock banks was occasionfJ b, the large profits
