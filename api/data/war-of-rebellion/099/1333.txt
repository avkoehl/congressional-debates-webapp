from your present position to fayetteville, if still practicable; if not, to Raleigh. The ends to be attained by this movement are so momentous-indeed, so vital-to success of operations which have been determined upon, that it is expected you will permit none but insurmontable obstatcles to turn you aside from the appemt, except, of course, if General Johnston should see cause, in the existing state of affairs, to change your instructions and give other orders.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGRD,

General.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE:

(Care Colonel Childs, Fayetteville.)

It is too late to turn to Fayetteville. Take the best route to Raleigh. It may be through Egypt, crossing both Deep and Haw Rivers, near their junction. There is a bridge over Deep River. You must not go toward Greensborough, but to raleigh, if you cannot turn to Fayetteville, of which you must judge. Where is the cavalry?

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
