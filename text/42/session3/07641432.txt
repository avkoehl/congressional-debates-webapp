urn
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 17,
free. Under that principle I shall vote for
the bill, and hope it will pass.
Mr. PERCE. I demand the previous ques-
tion.
Mr. HOLMAN. I wish to move an amend-
ment to the bill.
Mr. PERCE. I do not yield to any amend-
ment.
Mr. HEREFORD. The gentleman agreed
before the bill was taken up to allow amend-
ments to be offered.
Mr. PERCE. I think not.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. You said so dis-
tinctly.
Mr. HOLMAN. The gentleman said so in
words which could not be misunderstood.
M.r. PERCE. I understood the gentleman
to inquire whether it would be open for con-
sideration, and I said yes.
Mr. HOLMAN. And I asked the gentle-
man if it would be open for amendment, and
he said it would.
Mr. PERCE. No, sir.
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope the House will not
pfermit it.
Mr. ELDREDGrE. I hope the previous
question will not be seconded.
Mr. KERR. The understanding wals that
the bill would be open to amendment.
Mr. ELDREDGrE. This looks very much
like a trick.
The House divided; and there were—ayes
75, noes 64.
Mr. HOLMAN demanded tellers.
Tellers were ordered ; and Mr. Holman and
Mr. Perce were appointed.
The House again divided; and the tellers
reported—ayes 70, noes 66.
So the previous question was seconded.
Mr. HOLMAN. In view of the fact there
has been so gross a misapprehension in refer-
ence to this matter 
Mr. PERCE. I object to debate.
Mr. HOLMAN. I move to lay the bill upon
the table.
Mr. RANDALL. Oh, no! take the yeas
and nays on ordering the main question to be
put.
Mr. HOLMAN. Very well; I withdraw my
motion to lay upon the table, and demand the
yeas and nays on ordering the main question
to be put.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. HOLMAN. If the .House refuse to
order the main question will not the bill be
then open to amendment ?
The SPEAKER. It will.
The question was taken; and it was decided
in the affirmative—yeas 117, nays 71, not vot-
ing 52 ; as follows:

So the main question was ordered.
The SPEAKER. The main .question has
been ordered, which is, will the House.sub-
stitute the amendment moved by the gentle-
man from Mississippi [Mr. Perce] for the
Senate bill ?
Mr. HEREFORD. The gentleman from
Mississippi [Mr. Perce] yields to me to have
an amendment read.
Mr. PERCE. I yield merely to have it
Mr. HEREFORD. I offer the following
amendment:
The Clerk read as follows :
On page 3. section four, line seventeen, strike hut
the words 'on& college only in any State," and
insert as follows: "not more than two colleges ia
any State as the Legislature of such State may
determine."
Mr. PERCE. I cannot admit that amend-
mp.nt,.
The SPEAKER. It is not in the power of
any one to admit any amendment except by
unanimous consent.
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri. I desire to offet
an amendment.
Mr. PERCE. I have no objection to its
being read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amend the original bill by adding to the last sec-
tion the following provisions:
And provided farther. That before the college oi
colleges of any such States or Territories shall re-
ceive any benefits under this act, such State or Terri-
tory shall make provision lor the permanent and
continuous maintenance and education(ineluding
boarding, clothing, and all necessary expense) of
not less than one poor minor child, from each county
in said State or Territory, in such collegeorcolleges,
which shall be or whose parents shall be unable t.o
pay for the hoarding, clothing, and necessary ex-
penses of such minors while attending school in
such college or colleges.
Mr. HOLMAN. I seud to the desk an
amendment to be read.
Mr. PERCE. I object.
Mr. HOLMAN. I trust the gentleman will
allow it to be read.
Mr. PLATT. I object.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then I move the bill be
laid on the table, and on that motion I call

The SPEAKER. The question recurs on

will be agaia react.
The amendment was again read.

a third time; and it was accordingly read the
third time.

bill.

I call for the yeas and nays.

and nays, there were—ayes twenty-nine.
The SPEAKER. In the judgment of the
Chair a sufficient number have voted in the
affirmative to order the yeas and nays.

one hundred and sixteen negative votes.
