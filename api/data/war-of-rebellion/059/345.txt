Mooresville. Colonel Montgomery has also sent companies to secure bridges. Instruct him he can camp his regiment together as long as Logan's companies guard the bridges. This will give him a chance to drill. Also instruct him to keep the wood parties at work getting out wood for railroad use.

LEXINGTON, KY., April 13, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

General Sturgis reports that the enemy has appeared at Proctor. I have also information from parties just from Abingdon that Morgan has passed through Pound Gap with 3,000 cavalry, supported by infantry. General Stoneman and myself think it best to detain the troops ordered to Knoxville until the enemy's movements are developed. I will keep you advised.

Brigadier-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General BURBRIDGE,

Lexington, Ky.:

If it is true that Morgan has the force reported, Camp Burnside is more exposed than any other important point which he can reach. Consider this in determining whether to detain the infantry which is ordered to Knoxville, and in making your other dispositions.
