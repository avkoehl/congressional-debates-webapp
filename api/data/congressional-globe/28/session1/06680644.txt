which made it highly objectionable. It was in keeping with
that system of humbuggery which had always character'
ized the political party from whic&J&e proposition emanat-
ed. What had been the policy pursued oy the whig party?
Had they been governed by the principles which they re-
commend to others? Not at all.
Mr. H. commented at great length upon the inconsistencies
of the whig party.. .
Mr. TIBBATTS next obtained the floor, against many
competitors. ... « ,
Mr. WHITE insisted that he was entitled to the floor; and
he argued his right, on a point of order.
The CHAIRMAN explained, and declared the gentleman
from Kentucky [Mr. Tibbatts] in possession of the floor.
Mr. SCHENCK desired the gentleman from Kentucky to
yield him five minutes of his time, to reply to some remark
made by the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Henley.]
Mr. TIBBATTS expressed his willingness to yield, if he
should not also yield his right the floor.
The CHAIRMAN, after some conversation, decided that
the gentleman from Kentucky could not yield the floor to the
gentleman from Ohio, and retain his right to it at the close
of that gentleman's remarks.
Mr. SCHENCK then observed that he should get some
other opportunity to make his remarks; and he added: "If I
do not make the gentleman from Indiana sorry that he made
that allusion, I am much mistaken."
Mr. TIBBATTS then proceeded to address the committee;
and he commenced with the observation that he should con-
fine himself to a matter of business. He held an amend-
ment, which he intended to offer at the proper time; but he
desired now to say something in explanation of it; and,
that it might be understood, he asked that it might be read
from the clerk's table, for information.
The Clerk read it accordingly, as follows:
Be it further enacted by tkt Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives of the United States in Congress assembled, That
the sum of five hundred and fifty thousand dollars be, and
the same are hereby, appropriated'for the purpose of pur-
chasing the residue of the stock held by individuals in the
Louisville and Portland oanal company, and the Louisville
dry dock company, for the purpose of making the same free
from toll, which the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby
directed to purchase at the lowest price it can be had: Pro-
vided, That the whole cost of the purchase of the stock in
the said dry dock company shall not excced the sum of fifty
thousand dollars: And provided further, That the stock m
said canal company shall not cxcocd one hundred and thirty
dollars per share.
Mr. WHITE inquired if that amendment was now in order i
The CHAIRMAN replied that it was not.
Mr. WHITE then called upon the Chair not to entertain de-
bate on an amendment which was decided to |be out of order.
Tse CHAIRMAN did not feel authorized to stop the gen-
tleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Tibbatts,] after the latitude
which had heretofore been allowed in debate.
Mr. WHITE. Just such a decision as I expected.
Mr. TIBBATTS then proceeded at length to explain, and
advocated his amendment as follows:
He said: At an early period of the session, I introduced
a bill having the same object in view which is contemplated
by the amendment which I now propose to be made to the
bill under consideration. The bill I allude to was referred
to the Committee on Commerce, but as yet has not received
the action of that committee, owing to the delay necessary
to obtain the information to enable the committee to act un-
derstandinglyj upon the subject. The information has at
length, after much labor and difficulty, been collected, and
I am informed by the gentlemen of the committee having
the subject specially in charge, that they can be at any time
prepared to make their report; but as a separate bill would
fall so far behind in the calendar as to make the reaching of
it, in its order, hopeless at the present session of Congress,
1 have thought it best to propose the measure in the shape
m which I have now submitted it to the committee. I do
not intend to inflict a speech upon the committee, but as
this k a subject of the greatest importance to the entire
western and'southwestern country, and interesting to the
commercial relations of the whole Union, I bee leave to de-
tain the committee for a short time, whilst I, in as brief a
manner as the nature of the case will admit, lay before the
committee such facts as will enable gentleman to vote with
a pioper understanding of the importance of the question.
It is a fact, no doubt, known generally to the gentlemen
of the committee, that there exists a natural obstruction to
the navigation of the Ohio river at Louisville, which is
usually called the Falls of the Ohio. At this placfe, when
there is six feet of water on the crest of the fall, the fall of
the river, from the head to the foot of the falls, is 1.4 feet,
and at low water, or when the water is 3.4 feet upon the
crest of the falls, the fall in the river, from the head to the
foot of the falls, is 25 45 feet. The distance from the head
to the foot of the falls, or between the upper and lower
pools, is one mile and three-quarters. It will be apparent,
then, from the greatness of the fall in the river, that there
exists, at all times, a very serious impediment to the naviga-
tion of the river, and that, for a large proportion of the
year, there is a total obstruction to the navigation, both as-
cending and descending.
In order to avoid the difficulties thus existing to the com-
merce of the western country, the legislature of Kentucky,
by an act of the 12th January, 18*2-5, granted a perpetual
charter of incorporation to a company called the "Louis]
ville and Portland Canal company," for the purpose of con-
structing a canal navigation around the Falls of the Ohio
river, within the State of Kentucky, with a capital stock of
$600,000, divided into 6,000 shares of the par value of $100
each; limiting the lime of completing the canal to the 12th
of January, "18-28, which was afterwards extended to the
6th February, 1831. This act of incorporation autho-
red the company to levy rates of toll "for steam-
boats, sea-vessels, barges, or keel-boats, twenty cents
per ton, United States measurement; for each flat-boat, four
dollars; for each raft of timber, plank, or other lumber, four
dollars for eveiy sixty feet in length, not exceeding twenty
ieet in width;" and to "fix and^ytablish such sums as they
may deem advisable for the use of the docks, basins, and
other appendages to the said canal;" and providing that the
tolls maj be raised so as to net 12J per cent, on the stock;
but that it shall not exceed 18 per cent. By an act of the
legislature of Kentucky of the 21st December, 1829, the ca-
nal company was authorized to issue one thousand addi-
tional shares, of the par value of $100 each—thus making
the capital stock $700,000, divided into 7,000 shares, of the
par value of $100 each. By virtue of these acts to which I
have referred, the canal was completed; and the first boat
passed through it on the 22d December, 1830. In the mean
time, however, the stockholders had drawn no dividends,
and the construction ofthe canal had cost more than the in-
vestment, and the company, having met with great diffi-
culties and embarrassments in the construction ofthe work,
was involved in debt. The legislature of Kentucky, there-
fore, for the purpose of relieving the company from the pe-
cuniary embarrassments under which it was laboring, on
the 12th December, 1881, passed an act which authorized the
company again to extend the stock, and to sell additional
shares to an amount sufficient to pay all the costs ofthe con-
struction of the canal, and the interest thereon to the time
it was opened for navigation. By virtue of the provisions
of this last act, the company issued 3,000 additional shares,
of the par value of $100 each. From which it appears that
the whole amount ofthe capital stock of the canal company
consists of $1,000,000, divided into 10,000 shares of the par
value of $100 each, which were issued as follows:

Ofthe original stock, the government of the United States,
about the 4th June, 1825, subscribed for 1,000 shares, for
which $100,000 was paid. By authority of an act of the 2d
of March, 1829, the government purchased 1,336 additional
shares at the sum of $133,500, making the whole cash in-
vestment of the government in the canal company, $233,-
500. In addition to this, the government, under the act of
the Kentucky legislature of the 12th December, 1831, re-
ceived in stock, lor interest on its investment, $33,350, and
for her proportion of dividends, in stock, $23,350; making al-
together $56,700, or what wascousidered its equivalent, 567
shares of stock. The United States, therefore, own 2,902
shares ofthe capital stock of the canal company ofthe par val-
ue of $290,200, at a cost to the government of only $233,500.
And the canal company has paid into the treasury of the
United States in cash, as dividends, declared at va-
rious times from the 6th January, 1834, to the 1st Jan-
uary, 1843, the sum of $258,778, as follows; on the

Making the sum of - - -$257,778 00
as before stated; by which it will be apparent that the
government has not only received back in actual money
paid into the treasury ofthe United States, the $233,5f>0 in-
vested in the Louisville and Portland canal, but $24,278 over
and above that amount, and is the owner of 2,902 shares of
stock, which is worth $290,200, estimated at its par value
only, but which I will presently show is worth about $148
per share. But taking for the present the par value ofthe
stock as our criterion, I have thus shown that the govern-
ment, instead of losing by the investment made in the Lou-
isville ond Portland Canal company, as has been the case,
I believe, in every other investment for internal improve-
ments, has not only had every dollar ofthe investment re-
turned, but is the gainer $314,478; and thus, instead of giv-
ing the sum of $233,500 to facilitate and improve and remove
the obstructions to the commerce of the western countrv,
the government has, in fact, imposed a tax upon that com-
merce,and collected and received from it into the treasury, in
cash and in valuable stock, $314,578. This case is the only
instance, if 1 am not mistaken—and I believe I am not if
I am gentlemen will correct me—this, I say, is the only in-
stance in which the government of the United States has
received back any thing from its investments m internal im-
provements—much less not only every dollar it invested but
more than double the amount. I beg gentlemen to bear
these facts in mind, until I come to make an application of
them after a while, to the proposition! have submitted as an
amendment to the bill. At present, I wish to explain one or
two other circumstances which have a bearing upon the
proposition. The legislature of the State of Kentucky, by
an act approved the 21st January, 1842, provided that the
president and directors may sell the individual stock to the
United States—to Kentucky, or to the city of Louisville,
for the purpose of eventually making the canal free of tolls'
or, to effect the same object, may appropriate the net in-
come, instead of making dividends to the purchase of mdi-
vidual stock, at a maximum of $150, and 6 per centum add-
ed thereto, until the whole individual stock is purchased;
•When it is to be transferred to the United States, on condi-
tion of the government levying toll only to an amount suf-
ficient to keep it in repair, pay expenses, and make necessa-
ry improvements. Under the authority of this act, the
president and directors purchased or liquidated 471 shares
in 1842; and 544 shares in 1843; making in all 1015 shares:
so that the stock in the Canal company now stand as follows:
Whole amount of stock, in snares, - " 10,000
Owned by the United States, - - -2,902
Liquidated under act ofthe legislature of
Kentucky, of 1842, M15 ^
Leaving in the hands of individual stock- -
holders, - - - • " "...
which I propose to purchase with the appropriation asked
for in the amendment I have presented. As 544 shares were
liquidated in 1843, under the act of Kentucky, of 1842, I
presume that more than 583 shares will be liquidated the
present year; and I will sssume, therefore, that number as
the basis of the calculations which I am about to make:
this would leave 5,500 shares in the hands of individual
stockholders to be purchased, which, at par, would cost
$550,000; but, it is supposed, that the stock cannot be pur-
chased at that price, it being actually worth, as a stock in-
vestment, to,the individual holders, about $148 pershare, as I
will now show. By the act of Kentucky, of 1842, it has
been converted into a stock, worth, on the 1st of January,
1845, $168,1846, $177, at the rate of 6 per centum per annum,
and so on increasing in value every year, compound interest.
If an individual held twelve shares of this stock, one of
them to be redeemed or liquidated each year for twelve
years, the sums received by him, and the interest on them,
would amount to $3,564 56. If, on the other hand, he were
to sell those shares now at $143 each, it would amount to
$1,776—the compound interest on which for twelve years,
would be $1,788 56—making the whole, principal and inter-
est, $3,564 56.
But, owing to the fact that, by the act of 1842, the stock
in the canal company has ceased to be a permanent invest-
ment, which could be perpetually made to yield from 12£ to
■18 per cent, per annum, as was provided by the original
charter, and is now reduced to a temporary investment at 6
percent.; and that the tolls are considered a heavy burden
upon the commerce of the western country, and the canal
company arc daily becoming unpopular with a very nu-
merous and respectable class of our citizens engaged in nav-
igating the river; and as the present capacity of the canal is
not sufficient for the present advanced statu of the com-
merce of the river, and the kind of boats now used as best
adapted to that commerce; and as the people are loudly
calling out for a free and improved navigation, either by the
purchase and enlargement of this canal, or by improvement
of the falls itself, or by the erection of a canal on the Indiana
side, and for other reasons,—I am under the impression that
the stockholders ought to take considerably less for their
stock, and that, in view of all these things, they would take
less. I have, therefore, fixed the maximum value at which
the stock should be purchased at $130 per share. It may be
possible it could be got for less; but,, in view of the great
advantages to result to the commerce of the country, and
the heavy burdens it would remove from the shoulders of
the people, the government ought not to stand on the com-
paratively trifling amount which any difference between
$100 and $130 per share would amount to. At $130 per
share, then, the 5,500 shares would amount to the sum of
$715,000; and at par, to $550,000.
The tolls upon this canal operate as an onerous and most
severe tax upon the commerce of the West and Southw est,
and of course upon the East. It is true that there did
exibt a national obstruction of the navigation of the Ohio
river, which was partially removed by the construction of
this canal, and the country was, to that extent, benefited
by it. But we are apt, in the progressive improvement and
growth of the western country, and in the vast increase of
its inhabitants and commerce, to consider, and properly to
consider, not so much what evils have existed, and what
difficulties have been encountered and overcome—but what
now exist, with which we have to contend and surmount.
Such is the nature of man, and more particularly in the
West, where our march is onward, not to look back, but
forward; not to direct the attention to the past, but to pres-
ent and existing evils, and to evils anticipated in future
which must be overcome. We find a heavy burden now
existing there to our commerce; we feel that this burden
must be removed, This is a matter considered as settled;
the only question with us is, how it is best to be done."
As to the extent ol this burden upon our commeice. 1
beg leave to submit a few facts to the consideration of the
committee. By a table which I now have before me, which ac-
companies a letter of the president of the canal compan> ,
dated 24th January, 1844, in answer to certain interroga-
tories piopounded to Inm^by the Secretary ofthe Treasury,
in consequence of a series of resolutions, which I submitted
to the House at an early period of the session, itappeais
that from 1831 to 1843, inclusive, there have passed through
the canal 13,756 steamboats, 4.701 Hat and keel-boats, of
2.245,507 tons burden, at a cost of tolls paid by the naviga-
tor to the canal company of $1,227,625 20.
