Captain E. K. OWEN,U. S. Navy, Commanding Louisville:

DEAR CAPTAIN: I have this moment received a letter from Admiral Porter inclosing an order, of which the following is a copy:

CAIRO, January 24, 1864.

Lieutenant Commander E. K. OWEN,

Commanding Louisville, and Fifth Div. Mississippi Squadron:

SIR: You will without delay carry out the wishes of General Sherman in ascending the Yazoo to such point as he may direct, with every light-draught vessel you can raise.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DAVID D. PORTER,

Rear-Admiral.

I will be down in a day or two and would like then a few light-draught boats to ascend the Yazoo as far as Tchula, Honey Island, or even Greenwood, according to the stage of water. I propose to send along a small force in transports, more as a diversion than a real movement. I will come in the Juliet, which I suppose will oppose one of the number. The boat I spoke to you in coming up will have reconnoitered in part. If you do not receive by this a copy of the admiral's order, I will on meeting you give you my original copy, which has the admiral's signature. I would like if you would be ready, as to coal, &amp;c., by Thursday or Friday.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
