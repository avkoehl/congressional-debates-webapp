Major-General ROUSSEAU:

The road from here to Shelbyville is very bad, and about eight miles farther than by Wartrace, by which there is a good road. There are 150 sick here, besides considerable hospital and ordnance stores, and about 250 contrabands that can't march.

MURFREESBOROUGH, November 29, 1864-11 p.m.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

A train of cars will come at once from Nashville to bring away your artillery; have it ready to be loaded at the earliest possible moment and send it to this place. The garrisons between this place and Tullahoma will be gathered up by that train and brought here; place an efficient officer on the train to see to it. I will send Colonel Boone's adjutant or Captain Carson on the train down to notify the garrisons to be ready. Send all the ordnance stores you can to this place; the balance the other way. Have not yet heard from General Thomas as to the other matters. In withdrawing destroy nothing except what the rebels could use.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
