WASHINGTON, December 7, 1863-2.35 p.m.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis, Tennessee:

My attention has just been called to your General Orders, Numbers 157,

of November 15 last. It is presumed that that order was intended to apply only to persons liable to military duty under the laws of the United States, and not to impress foreigners into our military service. This must be made clear, so that foreigners may be assured that they are in no danger of being impressed into military service. The correction should be made without delay.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
