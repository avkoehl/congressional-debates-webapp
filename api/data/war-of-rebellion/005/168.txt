When work was completed and the command had started back, the enemy opened fire with shell, killing 2 and wounding 3. Griffin's battery silenced the enemy's battery. Our men came back in perfect order and excellent spirits. They behaved most admirably under fire. We shall have no more Bull Run affairs..

HEADQUARTERS CAMP ADVANCE, September 13, 1861.

CAPTAIN: I inclose herewith the report of Colonel Stevens, commanding the escort of Lieutenant Poe (also the latter's report and sketch), during the reconnaissance of the 11th instant. I heard the firing from camp, and proceeded to take command, after leaving verbal instructions for such troops as could be spared from here to follow me. On the way out I met Captain Mott, with a section of his battery, practicing his horses on the road, and gave him an order to follow, which he and his men obeyed with alacrity. On arriving on the field I found the command retreating in good order,t he men in good spirits, and professing themselves ready for anything. After I arrived Captain Griffin had two sections of his battery in use for a little while, but his fire was not replied to. Captain mott used his section in two positions for a few rounds. The dead and wounded were all brought in, but a lieutenant and 2 men of the Nineteenth Indiana had wandered from their proper places and were captured.

A man who has come in through the line informs me that he heard the Confederate troops say they lost 4 men killed and several horses. I give the report for what it is worth. I do not doubt but that strong forces had been brought from Flint Hill and Falls Church, and that a given them to attack us even while retreating, which was done without hurry and with great deliberation, but their artillery firing was stopped, and only glimpses were caught of their cavalry and infantry,and no disposition was evinced to come within range or our guns.
