troops of General Cutler on General Crawford's right (one brigade and three regiments), so that General Cutler can get his division together. I will then have a few troops disposable for any attack on the center, if made. I wish you would have this done as soon as you feel your line to be strong enough to make this extension left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 8 a. m.

General WARREN:

The enemy is in my front, or so reported by Generals Ayres and Bartlett. They were chopping all night, and now have a heavy skirmish line. The first portion of the night the enemy was reported moving to our left. General Ayres reports that his reveille sounded at 2 o'clock, and seemed to move a portion of his command to our right.

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

General GRIFFIN:

General Burnside's troops are all across the Totopotomoy. If you will let him relieve your division, you can move down toward our center, and we will then make the other troops advance.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 31, 1864 - 9.45 a. m.

General GRIFFIN:

I wish you to extend your line to the left, and replace General Cutler's troops as far as you can with a single line of battle; if necessary, with one brigade in reserve. I am throwing the left of our line forward to Bethesda Church, and shall attack the enemy there at once. They are moving in force toward Cold Harbor, to which point General Wright, with the Sixth Corps, is also moving. My attack is to be a diversion in favor of Wright, and prevent their accumulating against him. Baldy Smith is coming up to take position between Wright and me, but it will take all day to do it.

Relieve General Cutler's line as above as soon as you can. Do not take any count of Kitching's detachment, for I shall move them.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.

MAY 31, 1864.

General GRIFFIN:

I send you some dispatches just received to read and return. You must keep up connection with General Burnside's left as he advances.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN.
