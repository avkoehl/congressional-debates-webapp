86                                 APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._______________Jap. 1838.
25th Cong""2nd Sess.                       Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Wright.                                                          Senate
this subject was to be found in the twenty-third sec-
tion of the bill. The section was long, and con-
tained much de ail, but the principle adopted by it
■was simple and intelligible, it was merely a gra-
dual change, from the currency of specie paying
bank notes, to the legal currency of the country
The change was to commence after the close of the
present year, and was to cover the full period of
six years, making the change applicable lo one-
sixth part of the accruing revenue of each, be-
yond that of the next preceding year He could
most easily make the Senate acquainted with this
section, by saying that it was, in substance and
principle, the provision offered by ihc honorable
Senator from South Carolina, (Mr Calhoun,) by
way of amendment to the bill reported by the com
mittee to the Senate, at the extra session, in Sep
tember last The only matenal change made by
the committee, had been to extend the gradation of
the change in the currency from fourths to sixths,
so as to require six instead of four years to mike
the change entire The section might not be drawn
in the same words used by that Senator m his
amendment, but, with the exception just named,
the substance was identical
This was a feature of the bill which foimer ex-
perience assuied him would be more stiongly con-
tested, perhaps, than any other of Us provisions
It would be recollected by the Senate that, at the
extra session, the committee had incorporated into
their bill no provision in reference to the currency
in which the public dues should be received, and
that their opinion had been then expressed to the
body, that it would be most expedient to legislate
upon each of these great points separately, and by
separate bills A different opinion was stiongly
expressed at the time by several Senators, and dif-
ferent amendments touching this subject of the
currency weie early offered to the bill which the
committee did report After full debate, and by
deliberate voles, the amendment proposed by the
Senator from South Carolina was adopted, and
made a part of the bill Undei these circumstance ,
the committee had felt constrained, in miking
their report at this session, to include thi* piovision
m that repoit, and to make it a put of the sime
measure which should sepal ale the finances of the
country fiom the banking interests of the country
Hence is the section now 1 mml in the bill pic-
sented bv the committee, althi ugh it was not a
part of then former lepoit Still it piesents a
question oí deep m erfsi, of great magnitude, and
upon which there i ;ml diversity oí cpinion and
great delicacy of kcling, as well thioughout the
country as in this and the other house of Congress
It was not his purpose, at this time, to discuss
the section, except in one aspect, but in that one be
must make some suggestions The alarm taken it
the provision had relation principally to the Stale
banks, and it was m refeience to the interests of
those institutions that he proposed the suggestions
he was about to make The proposition is, giadu-
ally, and after the term of some six or seven ytars,
to discontinue the receipt of their notes in payment
of the public dues, although they may be, at the
time, specie piymg banks, and their notes may be
convertible into specie, at the «ill of the holder at
their banking house, wherever that may be located
The objection 1% that this rejection of the paper of
these banks, on the part of the National Cío verntrent,
will so far discredit their circulation generally as to
cripple their operations, deslioy their power-, of use-
fulness mthe local spheie of their legitimate opera
tions, and finally annihilate thtm Is there ground
for this apprehension' How are the charters of the
State banks obtained, and for «hat purposes1 Is
it that the circulation of their notes shall extend
over the whole Union1 Is it that thosp notes shall
take with them, wherever they may go, the futh
and credit of the United States, and be the legal
currency of the Fedeial Government at every point
and place m these twenty-s x States1 No no such
idea ever entered into the mmd of any man, who,
as a member of the Legislatuie of his State, has
voted for a local bark charter The only ground
upon which those applications ai< pressed upon tlu
State Legislatures is, the accommodation of the
commerce and business in the immediate vicinity
of the proposed location of the bank.   Look at the
statistics which are always made a part of the argu-
ment in favor of a particular State chailer Aie
they the statistics of the Union1 No they are the
statistics of the village, or town, or county, em-
bracing the location of the proposed bank, and they
are intended to prove the necessity of the banking
facilities proposed to be furnished by the charter at
that point Did any man ever suppose, then, that
the State Legislatures, to which these applications
are so constantly and perse venngly addiessed, con-
sidered themsehes, in their very liberal giants in
th s «a;, to be authoiizing a cuirency foi the
whole piople of the United States, and especially
a standard of currency for the Titasury of the
United States1 No Such a position would not
be assumed by any man here, nor would it by any
man in the country Wheie, then, aiose the obli-
gation of this Government to receive the notes of
these institutions thus chutered, and for such pur-
poses, in payment of the public dui s¡ He could
not see eithei the obligation or the duty, and cer-
tainly no une would contend, in case the notes
weie to be received, that they should be kept on
hand as the money treasure of the whole people
How, then, wuethey to be disjiosedoi in a man
ner to consult the safety of the public funds, in
case the) were to be perpetually received1 This
question admitted of but one answer They must
be presented, at short inteivals, to the banks which
issued them, and converted into money, into the
legal currency of the country In conformity with
this manifest principle, the bill provided that these
notes should not be made matter  of deposite, un-
dei the regulations it contains for special deposites
m banks It would be folly to deposite, merely
for safety, ihc representative of vilue, in the place
of the value itself, where the open option exist
ed lo constitute the deposite of the one 01 the othci
Which would, then, be mo«l useful to the State
banks to íecene then notes as cash at tha Treasu
ry,ind const mtly conveit them into specie, or gra-
dually to discontinue that leceipt altogether, and
collect the revenue m the legal cunency on]}1 To
allow th-m from six to seven years to conform
themselves, tin ir business, and their conditions, to
the changed stale if things, or to commence im-
mediately to receive their notes for the public dues,
so fir is those notes are redeemable in specie upon
dtman 1 at (heir banking-houses, and to present
them for payment at short íntcrvtls and m large
masses1 for himself, he must say he thought
the provi-ions of the section in question were more
mild, and more favorable to the State banks, ihan
die alternative he had contemplated The subject,
however, was befon the Senate It would be dis-
cussed by otheis, who had bestowed more thou2ht
and more research upon this particulai point than
he hid, the meiits of ihc question, in every aspect,
would be fairly and fully piesentcd, and he would
content himself with whatever decision should be
made Should this proposition not meet with fa
vi i he should ask the sense ot the Senate upon
the ilternativi, and he would not permit himself 10
doubt that the one or the other would be  adopted
The twenty fourth section wis mirelv calcu-
lated to ciny out tht one which preceded it, by
nnkinsi it imperative upon all disbursing officers,
after the time when the whole revenue should be
collectable in the legal currency of the United
Slates, to make all their disbursements m the same
currency, upon penalty of dismissal from office, and
a forfeiture of any compensation which might be
due to tlem at the time of their violation of the
law Tha twenty-fifth section might, perhaps, be
considered as somewhat connected with those which
have gone before it, as it requires the Secretary of
the Treasury to prescube the times within wh ch
the drafts of ihc Treasurer, drawn upon the
various deposilanc , according to their re-
spective dis anees from the seat of Government,
shall be piesented foi yayment, and after which
time tney shall not be accepted and paid by the de-
posjiiry, witaout new directions fiom ti e Secreta-
ry The object of this section, it will be seen, was to
jrevent these drafts fiom being made a currency for
fireulalion, based upon the cieditof the Govern-
rrent Since the suspension of the banks, in May
last, this use has been made of these drafts, to som«
extent, and it was thought desirable to check the
practice m its inception. The section was copied
from a piovision of the bill which passed the Se-
nate at the extra session, and which was inserted
in that bill, as an amendment, by the Senate itself
He would relieve the Senate and himself from,
any lurthei observations as to the details of the
bin. He had omitted several of greax importance,
and among them he would mention those which
made provision for the official bonds of the several
depositaries He believed those piovisions: broad
and ample, and such as were best calculated to se-
cure the public treasure, and he thougnt every Se-
natoi, upon examination, would agree with him in
this opinion. He would not attempt to particu-
larize the other sections which had not been noticed,
but would merely remark that none of them intro-
duced any new principle into the bill, and that he
thought all would be found to reach the object in-
tended by them
Such, Mr President, said Mr W is the system
which the majority of the Committee on Finance
have considered it to be their duty to present to the
Senate for the safe-keeping, transfer, and disburse-
ment, of the public money of the United States
This system is strenuously opposed, not by the po-
litico party uniformly opposed to the present Ad-
min istiation only, but by some of the respected and
influential individuals among those who have,
hitherto, been its friends and supporters What,
then, is proposed by those whs cannot give their
sup.iort to the bill before you1 The system of
Stite bank deposites seems to be more especially
urg 'd as the antagonist proposition, and, under the
impicssion that there was to rest the present con-
troveisy, so far as distinct propositions of any cha-
íacier would be submitted to the Senate, he pro-
posed to institute a comparison between the advan-
tages and disadvantages of each system, as con-
nected with the prominent objections which had
been, heretofore, urged against the provisions of
he bill
I' irst, then, as to the safety of the public money
undei th  system proposed by the bill, and uidcr
the Statp bank deposite system
Ihc bill proposes to require ample and oufficient
bonds and sureties from all the deposita. íes consti-
tute d by it, as one step towards the safety of the
money entrusted to the keeping of those agents
11 also proposes to provide vaults and safes at
the most important points of collection and dis-
buisement, m thisrespeci placing itself upon a par
widi banks, so far as physical securities are con-
cei ued
It further proposes to adopt the use of the vaults
an 1 sates ot the banks, at all places where those
secunties are not provided by the Government,
using the banks for safety simply, by the system of
spicial deposites, and not in any sens? as fiscal
agmts ol the Treasury
These are the guards which the astern consti-
tuted by the bill holds out to the people against the
loss of their treasure
The State bank deposite sist-m presents the
capitals of the institutions as secur t\ lor deposites,
in the same manner as for all othei haoililies of the
incorporation
It also presents its vaults and safes corstructed
foi its own security, and, it is fair to presume, as
securely constructed as tho e proposed for the Go-
"v eminent
It next presents, as we have heietofore practised
undent, collateral bonds, u ith sureties, for the due
and faithful fulfilment of its engagement on the
part of the bank
These are the protect ons to the pub ic treasuie
offered by the State bank deposite system, suppos-
ing, as he did, that the system, if contini ed, was
to remain upon the plan of optn or general d po-
ntes, as adopted in tne deposite b 11 of 1836
Otherwise, as he had shown m i fonei pail of
his remarks, the capital of the bank v oula not be
liable, except for gross negligence m ihc keeping of
the money placed in its vaults
What, then, aie the risks under e¿ch svsíem1
Undei that proposed by the bill, the only single
risk is that of the misconduct and dishonesty of the
officers to \ horn the safe-keeping of the nftmey is
entrusted, and that conduct, m addition to all other
legal liabilities, ls made a high crime, and punish-
