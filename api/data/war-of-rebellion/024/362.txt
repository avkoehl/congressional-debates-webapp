About 2 o'clock on the afternoon of the 8th, there being no water in the vicinity, we were ordered to move on a road to the right of our previous line of march, and after reaching a point 3 miles southwest of Ripley, encamped for the night near a running stream.

On October 10, the troops having rested one day, I received orders from General McArthur to return to Corinth with two regiments of my command, leaving two to return with General McPherson. Accordingly, at 5 a. m., of this day, I moved toward Corinth with the Thirteenth and Sixteenth Iowa, leaving the Eleventh and Fifteenth Iowa, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Hall, with orders to report to General McPherson. That night we reached the Hatchie River at 6 o'clock. Resumed our march at daylight on the morning of the 11th, and arrived at our present encampment, in the rear of Forst D and E, shortly after noon of that day.

I have no loss to report during these movements, my men returning in excellent condition.

The Eleventh and Fifteenth Iowa arrived at this camp on the evening of the 12th.

Respectfully,

M. M. CROCKER,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.
