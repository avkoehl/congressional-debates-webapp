MEADOW STATION, July 7, 1864.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The report brought in by citizens of the landing of the enemy at the White House is false. No enemy is in that vicinity-none higher up than Williamsburg. General Ewell desires you to communicate this to General Bragg. General Ewell is at Willis' Church, General Gary's headquarters.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

I fear the Danville company will do nothing of itself to repairing road. Government had better take possession of it and operate it.
