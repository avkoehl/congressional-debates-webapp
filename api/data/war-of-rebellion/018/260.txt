Have the Manassas Gap Railroad repaired if you can, to follow me. The bridges are all burned beyond Thoroughfare Gap. This is a shameful affair.

The women will take it if we don't.

From Manassas Gap they advanced as far yesterday as Thoroughfare Gap. One hundred and fifty cavalry were seen, and a company of horse artillery, with four pieces, at 4 miles from the latter place.
