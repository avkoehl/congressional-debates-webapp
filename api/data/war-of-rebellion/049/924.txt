HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,November 7, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch received. I have taken the rifle-pits in front of the redoubts and our pickers are on the river above and below the works, which we have not succeeded in taking. Prisoners report Ewell's corps at Brandy Station, which one division here. Hill's corps near Culpeper and Stevensburg, with one division at Kelly's Ford. I don't think I can cross to-night.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The assault on the redoubts is successful; both are carried. I have taken four guns and a number of prisoners. I cannot tell yet how many. Three guns are reported taken, but of this I am not certain. We can drive them, I think, from the works on the other side in the morning.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch of 6.30 just received. I sent you two messengers. I have taken the redoubt on this side by assault, and I think I can knock them out of the works on the other side in the morning. I think two strong divisions [sufficient] to hold this place [and] guard both fords.
