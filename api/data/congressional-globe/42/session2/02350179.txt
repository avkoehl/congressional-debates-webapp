Restricting the Killing of the Buffalo.
SPEECH OF HON. R. C. McCORMICK,
of arizona,
In the House op Representatives,
April 6, 1872.
The House having met for debate as in Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union—
Mr. McCORMICK, of Arizona. In various
trips over the plains, Mr. Speaker, my atten-
tion has been called to the reckless slaughter
of that noble and valuable animal, the Ameri-
can bison or buffalo. An illustration in a
recent number of Harper's Weekly well de-
picts the appearance of the plains where the
buffalo roams, the country for miles being cov-
ered with the deeaying carcasses of these ani-
mals killed in wanton sport; in many cases
neither the hide nor a pound of the flesh hav-
ing been taken by the hunters. An editorial
in the aforesaid paper says:
"The buffalo formerly ranged to the Atlantic sea-
board in Virginia and the Carolinas, and as far east
as the Hudson river and Lake Champlain, It Is
comparatively few years since the prairies of Illi-
nois were feeding-ground for thousands of buffalo.
Year by year they are pressed back into that strip
of land known until very recently by every school-
boy as 'The Great American Desert,' where they
are slaughtered at the rate of several hundred thou-
sand per anDUtn. Of this vast number but a com-
paratively small percentage is killed for food or fur.
Travelers shoot into the herds from coaches and rail-
way ears, without expecting to secure the game,
which they seldom do more than wound. Hunters
will in a single run bring down several, and a few
pounds of meat is all that is taken from any ani-
mal. Indeed, it would seem that strenuous efforts
are made to exterminate the bison within the short-
est convenient time. This is all very well for the
wolves, coyotes, and -ravens, but it is neither wise
nor sportsman-like. It should be here remarked
that Army officers generally deprecate this work,
and seem to realize that Uncle Sam will presently
be called upon to furnish funds from the Govern-
ment purse to supply beef to Indians who are now
well fed with buffalo beef, which they are caretul
never to waste."
My personal observation enables me to con-
firm the truth of these statements. Having
tho misfortune to be snow-bound upon the
Kansas Pacific railroad for some ten days and
nights in December, 1870, I was enabled to
understand tlxe value of the meat of the buffalo
as an article of food. It served a hundred or
more passengers almost exclusively, and but
for it they must have suffered great hunger if
not actual starvation. The flesh, excepting of
the older animals, is tender, nutritious, and
palatable. .
In view of an-emergency of the kind referred
io, likely, I may say, to arise on the line
of this railroad and that of the Union Pacific
and oilier western railroads during any severe
winter, and because of my conviction that
legal steps should be taken to prohibit this
shameful slaughter, which will in a few years
utterly exterminate the finest wild animal of
our hemisphere, I, more than twelve months
since, introduced the annexed bjlj, jpfciefe has
been agreed to by the Committee oa- PubHc
Lands, to which it was referred, and wit! be!
reported to the House at tbe first opportunity :
A bill restricting the killing of the biaon.x>3f buffalo,
upon the public lands'.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the United States of Aimerixa Jit Oonfirem
atsembled, That excepting for the purpose of using
the meat for food, or preserving the skin, it ebail be
unlawful for any person to kill the bistHi, or buffalbr,
found anywhere upon the public l^nasof th^Unit.ea
States, and for the violation of this law the offends
shall, upon conviction before any ce ft of compfetdrtt
jurisdiction, be liable to a fine of $100 for each &ni-
rnal killed, one half of which sum. shall* upoa i|s
collection, be paid to the informer. ' *
Lately, bills in the same words h$ve beep in-
troduced in the Senate by Senators Cole and
Wilson ; and public interest has bees excited
upon the subject by letters tp Henry Be?g^,
esq., the well-known president of Amer-
ican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, from prominent military officers serv-
ing on the plains. Of several of these let^e^s
Mr. Bergh has furnished me copies, which, I
now present for the consideration of tji^ Itouse:
Headqtjartb&s, Fob® Hays,
Kansas, January 20,1872.,
Dear Sir: Hoping to interest you, and through you
the people ot the country and. Congress, I wouki
respectfully state that the extraordinary introduc-
tion of railroads into and across the-wilds of oar
country has made the vast herds of wild buffalo of
the plains accessible to .all classes of geogie, and
each year vast numbers are slaughtered lor so -called
sport, and a greatef number by hunters fo# their
hides, which net aboutone dollar each, f.h^v^seen
numbers of men this winter who h^ve during fcbfi
past season killed one thousand e^ch for the mltty
sum of one dollar apiece, the carcasses feoingleft to
rot on the plains. The buffalo Is a noble ana harm-
less animal, timid, and as easily taken a& a go1#, and
very valuable as food for man. It lises njwm k
short grass which grows luxuriantly u,pon tfce mgp*
arid plains of this middle region, that is from dry-
ness unfit for agriculture. The theory that the buf-
falo should be killed to deprive the Indians of food
is a fallacy, as these people are becoming harmless
under a rule of justice. In view of these facts I
would most respectfully and earnestly request that
you use such proper influences as may be at your
disposal to bring this subject befoce Qoagress, with
the intention of having suoh steps taken as Will p re-
vent this wicked and wanton waste both of the
lives of God's creatures and the valuable foodtthey
furnish.
I am, very respectfully* your obedient servant*
W. B. HAZEN,
Colonel Sixth Infantry, Brev. Maj. Gen. U.S. A.
H. Bergh, esq.
Omaha Barracks, Nebraska,
January 30,1872.
Sir : I have read with a great deal of i terest the
letter of General Hazen to you respecting the need-
less killing of buffaloes. What he says is strictly
true, and there is as much honor and danger vn kill-
ing a Texas steer as there is in killing a buffalo. All
the reports about fine sport and good shooting are
mere gammon. It would be equaHy.as good sport,
and equally as dangerous, to" riaefnto aberdoftame
cattle and coinmeaeesbooting in.dkcrimin^teig?., lbe
wholesale butchery of buffaloes upon the pla-ms is
as needless as it is cruel. Hundreds and hundreds
of them have been killed in the ipost wanton inanr
ner, or for their tongues alone. It is time that some-
thing should be done for their protection, and I trust
you will make an effort to have Congress interfere
in their behalf. It is an abuse of language to call
the killing of harmless and defenseless buffaloes
*1 am, sir, very respectfully, your oJ>©dient^servant,
A. G  BRACKS 11,
Lieutenant Colonel Second United States Cavairyi
POTTSVILLE,
February 18, 1872.
Bear Sir : Having just read General Hazen's let-
ter to you in regard to tbe wanton destruction ot
the buffalo, I feci it a duty to add my testimony to
bis with reference to the game. In Gonsequpnce
an experience of thirteen years on the plains, the
major portion of tbe period m the scrv?
United States, in the Army, and as Indian agent,!
had a good opportunity of observation 0J t k ^ ®y.11
which General Hazen refers to. I
testily, at any time, to -what I have seen of the-par-
tioulars mentioned! by (reneral Hazen. wkerlL
another strong reason, apart from cruelty, 4£C.t
which should compel Congress to take action; it is
one of the greatest grievances the Indians fiave;
and to my personal knowledge, has frequently been
their strongest incentive to declare war. v^ie

Washington, at one time remarked to me alter 1 ua<r
