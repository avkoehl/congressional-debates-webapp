HDQRS. DIST. OF MINNESOTA, DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,Saint Paul, Minn., August 22, 1864.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Commanding Department of the Northwest, Milwaukee, Wis.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that your dispatch of the 16th instant, conveying instructions and covering copy of dispatch to Brigadier-General Sully, was only received this morning. The extremely low stage of water in the Mississippi has so seriously interrupted the navigation of the river by even the smallest class of steamers that any further attempts of boats to reach this city are about to be abandoned and communication overland to some point on the river below resorted to. The mail of this morning is the first that has reached here since the 19th instant. Your directions will be communicated in the form of sealed orders, addressed to Colonel Thomas, at Fort Wadsworth, and no time will be lost after the return of the expeditionary force in carrying out the details. Lieutenant-Colonel Pfaender, commanding Second Sub-District, is in the field at the head of a small force in search of the Indians lately discovered near Hole-in-the-Mountain, on this side the Big Sioux River, so that I have no later dispatches than the 16th instant from him, but Colonel Smith, commanding the State militia, reports to Governor Miller on 19th that the whole people on the frontier are thoroughly alarmed, and are preparing for a general exodus from their homes in case of other raids. I have directed Major Clowney to open a weekly communication, via Fort Abercrombie, by means of his scouts, so that the mail matter for Wadsworth is sent direct to that post.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DIST. OF MINNESOTA, DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,Saint Paul, Minn., August 22, 1864.

Colonel M. T. THOMAS,

Commanding Expeditionary Force, Fort Wadsworth, Dak. Ter.:

COLONEL: In compliance with instructions from Major-General Pope, commanding the department, dated 16th instant, you are directed on your arrival with your returning command at Fort Wadsworth to detail four companies of Second Minnesota Cavalry to relieve the three companies of Thirtieth Wisconsin Volunteers in garrison at Fort Wadsworth. Major R. H. Rose, Second Minnesota Cavalry, will be placed in command until further orders. Major Clowney upon being relieved will march immediately via Fort Ridgely to Saint Paul with the companies of the Thirtieth Wisconsin Volunteers. At Fort Ridgely he will be joined by the company of the same regiment now doing garrison duty at that post. You will after leaving Fort Wadsworth take up the line of march to Saint Paul by way of Fort ridgely with your entire regiment without any unnecessary delay, but should there be anywhere in the vicinity of your route any camp or body of hostile Indians you are authorized to attack them and destroy them if possible. The remainder of your force will be left at Fort Ridgely unless you receive other orders on arriving at that post. The destination of your regiment is south, but to what point has not been communicated.

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
