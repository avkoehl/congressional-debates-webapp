capita-, wliile in 1869 they will reach the ex-
travagant sum of $9 78per capita.
It will be observed that all of these state-
ments refer to and exhibit the disbursements
of peace periods. It may, therefore, be of
interest to compare the expenditures of the
three war periods—the war with Great Britain,
the Mexican war, and the war of the rebellion.
In 181*1 the annual expenses incident to the
war of 1812 reached their highest amount—
about thirty one millions ; while our population
slightly exceeded eight millions, showing an
expenditure of only $3 80 per capita? In 1847
the expenditures growing oat of the war^with
Mexico reached $55;000,000, and the popula-
tion abouttwenty-one millions, givingonly §2 60
per capita for the war expenses of that year.
In 1865 the expenditures called for by the rebel-
lion reached the vast amount of $1,290,000,000,
which, compared with a population of thirty-
four millions, gives $38 20 per capita.
Prom the 4th day of March, 1789, to the 30th
of June, 1861, the entire expenditures of the
Government were §1,700,000,000. During
that period we were engaged in wars with
Great Britain and Mexico, and were involved
in hostilities with powerful Indian tribes;
Louisiana was purchased from Prance at a
cost of $15,000,000; Florida was ceded to us
by Spain for $5,000,000; California was ac-
quired from Mexico for $15,000,000 ; and the
Territory of New Mexico was obtained from
Texas for the sum of $10,000,000. Early in
1861 the war of the rebellion commenced; and
from the 1st of July of that year to the SOihof
June, 1865, the public expenditures reached
the enormous aggregate of $3,300,000,000.
Three years of peace have intervened, and
during that time the disbursements of the Gov-
ernment have successively been $520,000,000,
$346,000,000, and §393,000,000. Adding to
these amounts §372,000,000, estimated as
necessary for the fiscal year endingthe 30th of
June, 1869, we obtain a total expenditure of
$1,600,000,000 during the four years imme-
diately succeeding the war, or nearly as much
as was expended during the seventy-two years
that preceded the rebellion, and embraced the
extraordinary expenditures already named.
These startling facts clearly illustrate the
necessity of retrenchment in all branches of
the public service. Abuses which were toler-
ated during the war for the preservation of the
nation will not be endured by the people, now
that profound peace prevails. The receipts
from internal revenues and customs have dur-
ing the past three years gradually diminished,
and the continuance of useless and extravagant
expenditures will involve us in national bank-
ruptcy, or else make inevitable an increase of
taxes, already too onerous, and in many re-
spects obnoxious on account of their inquisi-
torial character. One hundred millions an-
nually are expended for the military force, a
large portion of which is employed in the exe-
cution of laws both unnecessary and unconsti-
tutional ; $150,000,000 are required each year
to pay the interest on the public debt; an army
of tax-gatherers impoverishes the nation; and
public agents, placed by Congress beyond the
control of the Executive, divert from their
legitimate purposes large sums of money which
they collect from the people in the name of
the Government. Judicious legislation and
prudent economy can alone remedy defects
and avert evils which, if suffered to exist, can-
not fail to diminish confidence in the public
councils, and weaken the attachment and re-
spect ol the people toward their political insti-
tutions. Without proper care thesmall balance
which it is estimated will remain in the Treas-
ury at the close of the present fiscal year will
not be realized, and additional millions be
added to a debt which is now enumerated by
billions.
It is shown, by the able and comprehensive
report of the Secretary of the Treasury, that
the receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1868, were $405,638,083, and that the expend-
itures for the same period were $377,340,284,
leaving i n the Treasury a surplus of $28,297,798.
It is estimated that the reeeipts during the
present fiscalyear ending .June 30, 1S69, .will
be $341,392,868, and the expenditures $336,-
152,47dJ showing a small balance of $5,240,898
in favor of the Government. For the fisial
year ending June 30, 1870, it is estimated that
the receipts will amount to $327,000,000, and
the expenditures to $303,000,000, leaving an
estimated surplus of $24,000,000.
,It becomes .proper, in this .connection, to
make a brief reference to^ourpublie indebted-
ness, Which has accumulated with such alarm-
ing rapidity and assumed such colossal pro-
portions.
In 1789, when the Government commenced
operations under the Federal Constitution, it was
burdened with an indebtedness of $75,000,000
created during the war of the Revolution. This
amount had been reduced to $45,000,000 wheu
in 1812 war was declared against Great Britain.
The three years' struggle that followed largely
increased the national obligations, and in 1816
they had attained the sum of $127,000,000.
Wise and economical legislation, however,
enabled the Government to pay the entire
amount within a period of twenty years, and
the extinguishment of the national debt filled
the land with rejoicing, and was one of the
"great events of President Jackson's adminis-
tration. After its redemption a large fund
remained in the Treasury, which was deposited
fyr safe keeping with the several States, on
condition that it should be returned when
required by the public wants. In 1849—the
year after the termination of an expensive war
with Mexico—we found ourselves involved in a
debt of $64,000,000; and this was the amount
owed by the Government in 1860, just prior to
the outbreak of the rebellion. In the spring of
of 1861 our civil war commenced. Each year
of its continuance made an enormous addition
to the debt; and when, in the spring of 1865,
the nation successfully emerged from the con-
flict, the obligations of the Government had
reached the immense sum of $2,873,992,909.
The Secretary of the Treasury shows that on the
lstday ofNovember, 1867,thisamount had been
reduced to $2,491,504,450; but at the same
time his report exhibits an increase during the
past year of $35,625,102 ; for the debt on the
1st day of November last is stated to have been
$2,527,129,5-52. It is estimated by the Sec-
retary that the returns for the past month
wili add to our liabilities the further sum of
$11,000,000—making a total increase during
thirteen months of $46,500,000.
In my message to Congress of December 4,
1865, it was suggested that a policy should be
devised which, without being oppressive to the
people, would at once begin to effect a reduc-
tion of the debt, and if persisted in discharge
it fully within adefinite number of years. The
Secretary of the Treasury forcibly recommends
legislation of this character, and justly urges
that the longer it is deferred the more difficult
must become its accomplishment. We should
follow the wise precedents established in 1789
and 1816, and without further delay make pro-
vision for the payment of our obligations at as
early a period as may be practicable. The
fruits of their labors should be enjoyed by
our citizens, rather than used to build up and
sustain moneyed monopolies in our own and
other lands. Our foreign debt is already com-
puted by the Secretary of the Treasury at
$850,000,000; citizens of foreign countries re-
ceive interest upon a large portion qy^our secur-
ities, and American tax-payers are made to
contribute large sums for their support. The
idea that such a debt is to become permanent
should be at all times discarded, as involving
taxation too heavy to be borne, and payment
once in every sixteen years, at the present rate
of interest, of an amount equal to the original
sum. This vast debt, if permitted to become
permanent and increasing, must eventually be
gathered into the hands of a few, and enable
them to exert a dangerous and controlling power
in the affairs of the Government. The borrow-
ers would become servants to the lenders—the
lenders the masters of the people. We now s
pride ourselves upon having given freedom to
four millions of the colored race ; it will then
be our shame that forty million people, by
their own toleration of usurpation and profli-
gacy, have suffered themselves to become
enslaved, and merely exchanged slave-owners
for new, taskmasters in the shape of bondhold-
ers and tax-gatherers. Besides, permanent
debts pertain to monarchical Governments,
and tending to monopolies, perpetuities, and
class legislation, are totally irreconcilable with
free institutions. Introduced into our repub-
lican system, they would gradually but surely
sap its foundations, eventually subvert our
governmental fabric, and erect upon its ruins
a moneyed aristocracy. It is our sacred duty
to transmit unimpaired to our posterity the
blessings of liberty which were bequeathed to
us by the founders of the Republic, and by our
example teach those who are to follow us care-
fully to avoid' the dangers which threaten a free
and independent people.
Various plans have been proposed for- the
payment of the public debt. However they
may have varied as to the time and mode in
which it should be redeemed, there seems to
be a general concurrence as to the propriety
and justness of a reduction in the present rate
of interest. The Secretary of the Treasury, in
his report, recommends five per cent.; Con-
gress, in a bill passed prior to adjournment on
the 27th of July last, agreed upon four and four
and a half per cent. ; while by many three per
cent, has been held to be an amply sufficient
return for the investment. The general im-
pression as to the exorbitancy of the existing
rate of interest has led to an inquiry in the pub-
lic mind respecting the consideration whicli the
Government has actually received for its bonds,
and the conclusion is becoming prevalent that
the amount which it obtained was in real money
i three or four hundred per cent, less than the
' obligations which it issued in return. It can-
not be denied that we are paying au extrava-
gant percentage for the use of the money bor-
rowed, which was paper currency, greatly
depreciated below the value of com. This fact
is made appurent when we consider that bond-
holders receive from the Treasury, upon each
dollar they own in Government securities, six
per cent, iu gold, which is nearly or quite
equal to nine per cent, in currency ; that the
bonds are then converted into capital for the
national banks, upon which those institutions
| issue their circulation, bearing six per cent,
i interest; and that they are exempt from taxa-
; tion by the Government and the States, and
I thereby enhanced two per cent, in the hands
! of the holders. We thus have an aggregate of
i seventeen per cent, which may be received
upon each dollar by the owners of Government
securities.
A system that produces such results is justly
regarded as favoring a few at the expense of
the many, and has led to the further inquiry
whether our bondholders, in view of the large
profits which they have enjoyed, would them-
selves be averse to a settlement of our indebted-
ness upon a plan which would yield them a fair
remuneration, and at the same time be just to
the tax-payers of the nation. Our national
credit should be sacredly observed ; but in
making provision for our creditors we should
not forget what is due to the masses of the
people. It may be assumed that the holders
of our securities have already received upon
their bonds a larger amount than their oiiginal
investment, measured by a gold standard.
Upon this statement of facts it would seem but
just and equitable that the six per cent, inter-
est now paid by the Government should be
applied to the reduction of the principal in
