ally liable for the debts of the company then
existing, and for all that shall be contracted
before such report shall be made.

declare and pay any dividend the payment of
which would render it insolvent, or which

all the debts of the company then existing,
and for all that shall be thereafter contracted,
while they shall respectively remain in office :
Provided, That if any of the trustees shall
object to the declaring of such dividend, or the

before the time fixed for the payment thereof

with the secretary of the company and with the
register of deeds of the District of Columbia,
they shall be exempt from the said liability.

payment of any part of the capital stock, and
no loan of money shall be made by any such
company to any stockholder therein ; and if
any such loan shall be made to a stockholder,
the officers who shall make it, or who shall
assent thereto, shall be jointly and severally
liable, to the extent of such loan and interest,
for all the debts of the company contracted
while they are stockholders or officers thereof.

notice given, by the officers of any company
in pursuance of the provisions of this act,

knowing it to be false, shall be jointly and
severally liable for all the debts of the com-
pany contracted while they are stockholders
or officers thereof.
No person holding stock in such company as
executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee,
and no person holding such stock as collateral
security, shall be personally subject to any
liability as stockholder of such company ; but
the person pledging such stock shall be con-
sidered as holding the same, and shall be liable
as a stockholder accordingly; and the estate
and funds in the hands of such executor, ad-
ministrator, guardian, or trustee, shall be liable
in like manner and to the same extent as the
testator or intestate, or the ward or person
interested in such trust fund would have been
if he had been living and competent to act
and held the stock in his own name.
Every such executor, administrator, guard-
ian, or trustee, shall represent the stock in his
hands at all meetings of the company, and may
vote accordingly as a stockholder ; and every
person who shall pledge his stock as aforesaid
may, nevertheless, represent the same at ail
such meetings, and may vote accordingly as a
stockholder.

under the provisions of this act shall, jointly,
severally, and individually, be liable for all
debts that may be due and owing to all their

be individually liable for all debts of said cor-
poration to the amount of the stock of each
stockholder.

formed, by special act or under the general

transportation, marketing, or mechanical pur-
poses, in the District of Columbia, or any com-
pany which may be formed under this act, may
increase or diminish its capital stock, by com-
plying with the provisions of this act, to any
amount which may be deemed sufficient and
proper for the purposes of the corporation, and
may also extend its business to other manu-
facturing, mining, or mechanical business, sub-
ject to the provisions and liabilities of this
act. But before any corporation shall be en-
titled to diminish the amount of its capital
stock, if the amount of its debts and liabilities
shall exceed the amount of capital to which it
is proposed to be reduced, such amount of
debts and liabilities shall be satisfied and
reduced so as not to exceed such diminished
amount of capital; and any existing company
heretofore formed may come under and avail
itself of the privileges and provisions of this
act by complying with the following provis-
ions, and thereupon such company, its officers
and stockholders, shall be subject to all the
restrictions, duties, and liabilities of this act.

ing its business, it shall be the duty of the
trustees or directors to publish a notice signed
by a majority of them in a newspaper in the
District of Columbia at least three successive
