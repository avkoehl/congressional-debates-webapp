The disorderly manner in which some of the troops of the Fourth Army Corps retreated caused a slight confusion, and, indeed the enemy made his appearance on the outside of the first line of works almost simultaneous with the retreat of the Fourth Army Corps. I then ordered the reserve regiments to first line in support. The Fiftieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Gillespie commanding, and Seventy-second Illinois Volunteer Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Stockton commanding, renewed the attack with great vigor and gallantry; while the Forty-fourth Missouri Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Bradshaw commanding, and One hundred and eighty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Hoge commanding moved up in good order,under a most terrific fire, and took full possession of the first line of works, and in a hand-to-hand encounter the four regiments drove the enemy from the works, which was held with great tenacity, capturing a number of prisoners (not known). In the charge to drive the enemy from their immediate front of the first line and save it from capture by the enemy, Colonel Bradshaw, of the Forty-fourth Missouri Volunteer Infantry, while leading his regiment, with colors in hand, and most gallantly, by while leading his regiment, with colors in hand, and most gallantly, by personal example, encouraging his men, fell mortally wounded,* also, at the same moment, Lieutenant Colonel M. Clark, One hundred and eighty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was instantly killed while actively engaged assisting in bringing his regiment up to the first line, while Lieutenant-Colonel Stockton and Major James, of the Seventy-second Illinois Regiment of Infantry, were wounded at the same time.

The tenacity with which the Fiftieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry and Seventy-second Illinois Volunteer Infantry held the first line, stubbornly refusing to yield their position, in the midst of a most terrible carnage, and the prompt manner in which the Forty-fourth Missouri and the One hundred and eighty-third Ohio Regiments executed the order to move up to the support of the first line, midst a shower of leaden rain, cannot fail to command the highest admiration of our superiors in the engagement and challenge the good opinion of all brave comrades in the battle.

Lieutenant Colonel H. S. Gillespie, Fiftieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Lieutenant-Colonel Stockton, Seventy-second Illinois Volunteer Infantry and Major James of same regiment; and Captain J. A. Sexton, Seventy-second Illinois, [who] took command of regiment when both field officers fell; Colonel Hoge, One hundred and eighty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Barr, Forty-fourth Missouri Volunteer Infantry-all are deserving of the highest praise for the marked ability in the management of their men, as well as their noble conduct of true bravery, so handsomely displayed throughout the engagement. To the other officers and men of the entire command I can find no words fitting the occasion sufficiently strong in terms of commendation for the pluck, stubbornness, and genuine heroism exhibited throughout.

I am greatly indebted to the officers of my staff, most especially the three who were present with me during the engagement: First Lieutenant John B. McLoe, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain L. A. Burke acting assistant inspector-general; Second Lieutenant C. A. Van Deursen, acting aide-de-camp. Their conduct was such in personal gallantry throughout that entitled them to my deepest gratitude, and as examples worthy of imitation by all good soldiers in so trying an hour of battle. I cannot forget to mention that my two orderlies, John W. Fouts, color-
