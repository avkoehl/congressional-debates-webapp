Another day without rain, roads drying rapidly, and prospect of work to-morrow. To-day both right and left have been advanced slightly under artillery fire, but no material difference in position of either army since my last. Trouble again with railroad and telegraph near Dalton. Bridge burned.

As there may be a leak, I report to you that an intercepted letter to Vallandigham says two corps have been ordered from Sherman secretly to General Grant.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Kenesaw Mountain, June 24, 1864-9.15 a. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

I have been along the line this morning, and find that the enemy's intrenchments in front of Howard and Palmer are very strong. The troops are also much fatigued in consequence of the continuous operations of the last three or four days. Howard's and Palmer's fronts are now so much extended that it will be exceedingly difficult for them to mass a sufficient number of men to make an effective move on any point. Schofield and Hooker were moved up on the Powder Springs and Marietta road it would contract our lines and enable us to strengthen them. I have just heard from General E. M. McCook, who was ordered to send a reconnaissance in the direction of Powder Springs yesterday. He reports no enemy in Powder Springs, but all on south side of Noyes' Creek.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
