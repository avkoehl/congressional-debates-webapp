316                                   THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                            March 2,
ond time, ordered to be engrossed, and read a third
time:
A bill for the relief of Samuel L. Asbury;
A bill for the relief of the children of Domimck
Lynch;
A bill for the relief of Daniel Page;
A bill for the relief of Peter Triplet!,
A bill for the relief of Stephen Gailm;
A bill for the relief of Lamed Swallow; and
A bill to regulate the pay of the officers of the
navy.
While the latter bill was under consideration,
Mr. HILL said, if the bill for raising the salaries
of the officers of the navy should pass, he would
consider it to be one of the most severe blows ever
inflicted on the American navy. As the sincere
friend of that navy he hoped the Senate would
pause before they inflicted this blow There is a
point beyond which the people will not go; they
are willing amply to remunerate every man in
their employ to the full amount of his services;
but they never will consent that deception shall be
palmed upon them.
I have (said Mr. H ) before me tables of the
pay of the officers of the French and the British
navy, and I will present them in contrast with the
pay of the officers of the American navy as it
stands before the passage of this law.
Mode of rating Ships in the Biitish Navy.

One fifth of the above to be deducted when the
officers are on shore.
When at sea, the officers receive a dally mesa
allowance in addition, varying according to the
service or station on which they are to be em-
ployed.
The midshipmen (eleves) of the 2J class receive
no pay, except when in service.
Mr HILL continued. From these several
statements it will be seen that the pay of tRe offi-
cers of the navy of the United States, under the
law as it now stands, is bettei, much better, than
the pay either in the British or French navy.
Thus it will be seen that the commander of a
frigate in the French navy íeceives (besides a
mess allowance of about one fourth) $787 50, the
same commander m the British navy íeceives, in
full of all pay and emoluments, $2,213 56; while
an American commander, of the same grade, re-
ceives $2 170, besides other emoluments. Here
an offieet of this grade has at least equal pay to an
officer of the same grade in the British navy, and
nearly double the pay of the same grade of offi-
cers m the French navy. Yet the bill raises the
compensation of this officer from $3,500 as a min-
imum to $4,500 per annum as a maximum allow-
ance
But the pay of lieutenants is raised in still higher
proportion. A first lieutenant in the French
navy, exclusive of daily mess allowance, receives
while on sea duty $45U, a Biitish lieutenant, as
his highest and exclusive allowance, receives
$663 78; while an American lieutenant, of the
highest grade, receives JJ1.296 25, and of the low-
est grade #965 perannum, under the law as it now
stands. The new bill laises this pay of lieuten-
ants of the highest grade to §1,800, and even the
lowest is to receive $1,500 while on board ship.
This is more than treble the pay of French offi-
cers of the same grade, and nearly treble that of
the Biitibh service.
Take, also, the pay of the most numerous class
of officers. Midshipmen in the Fiench navy re-
ceive no pay except when in actual service, and
when in service, besides the daily mess allowance,
they recen e as piy only |52 50 per annum. Mid-
shipmen in the British navy receive, as their full
emoluments, §138 52.     American  midshipmen,
