Brevet Major-General WILSON,

Gravelly Springs:

Major Forbes, of my command, met flag of truce from Major-General Forrest near Iuka to-day. Dispatches for Colonel Parkhurst, provost-marshal-general, Department of the Cumberland, opened by myself under instructions from Colonel Parkhurst. The prisoners for exchange will not be at Iuka earlier than the 10th, probably not until the 12th, owing to breakage of railroad by high water. Information received from my scouts as follows:

A telegram received at Rienzi says: Longstreet in front of Sherman. Hardee on his right flank. Cheatham with his corps came up in the rear of Sherman, when General Sherman turned upon him, thoroughly using Cheatham up. Forrest has about 8,000 cavalry. Taylor commands the remains of Stewart's and Lee's corps, now at Selma and near Mobile. Roddey near Tuscaloosa collecting the forces of Northern Alabama.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, March 6, 1865.

Major-General THOMAS:

I must apologize for not having seen you this morning before I left, but the truth is I was in such a hurry to get off that I am ashamed to say I forgot to call until I had [gone] several miles on the road. I leave at once on the train that takes the horses of the Eleventh Kentucky. The cars are not here for the Twelfth Kentucky, but have been sent for, and I hope the regiment will get off to-night.

GEO. STONEMAN,

Major-General.
