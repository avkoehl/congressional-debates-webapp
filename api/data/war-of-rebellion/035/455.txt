GENERAL: Your dispatch of 8.40 a. m. is received. The general commanding directs you to send cavalry well out to your right, to discover whether the enemy is making any demonstrations in that direction. Send your train this way, in rear of Brannan, with a view of bringing your command across to this pike and eastward. In the mean time, hold a threatening front toward the enemy, and keep him in ignorance of your intended flank movement.

As soon as definite information is received from yourself and General Thomas of the enemy's strength and movements, further orders will be given.

All goes well thus far.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
