brigade of his division is in rear of Pickett's division in our immediate front acting as a reserve brigade. This information is positive. Wilcox's division, of Hill's corps, is reported as being between New Market and Chaffin's farm. This, however, needs confirmation.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The enemy are working with a heavy detail upon their new work three-fourths of a mile south of the lead-works and on the west side of the Weldon railroad. It seems to be about as large as the fort at this station, the main front being eastward. There are small working parties shoveling in vicinity of the Gregory Chimneys. No movement visible at any other portion of this end of the line. Their camps along the line indicate a greater number present than last week. Some more timber brought to the battery near the Gregory Chimneys.
