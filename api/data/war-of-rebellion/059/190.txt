Forty rounds of ammunition must be carried by each man and 20 rounds per man must be carried in wagons. Three days' rations will be carried in haversacks. Only one wagon and two ambulances per regiment will be allowed. As much forage must be carried as possible with the limited transportation, as the country is supposed to contain but little.
