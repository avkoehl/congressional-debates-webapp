alry) I can spare from other points, with the view of resisting their landing.

2nd. If these companies are taken away, and their places not supplied, I shall be obliged to abandon the whole coast from Georgetown to Little River, as I will have barely enough troops to man Battery White and picket the country in its rear; as it is, with the present force, I have been compelled to dismount one of the two light artillery companies to man the guns in said battery. To withdraw the pickets from Waccamaw Neck would be to invest the enemy to come in and take off an immense quantity of grain now there, with perhaps all the negroes (numbering on that Neck alone 4,431). This estimate of number has just been made out and is correct. Again, if we cannot protect that coast, Battery White will be of little use, as the enemy will have open access to the whole surrounding country. With the knowledge of the above facts I feel it due to myself, as well as the people of this section, together with the loss that would be sustained by the Government, to ask that the commanding general would relieve these troops by others before his order is carried into effect. Hoping that the facts stated will justify my delay until further orders, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH A. YATES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Fourth Military District.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT, DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, May 1, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded. Lieutenant-Colonel Yates' detention of Major Emanuel's command under the circumstances is recommended for approval. Major White has been directed to expedite the movement of his battalion as much as possible. The 32-pounder guns, rifles, have been sent to Colonel Yates, and I intend to re-enforce that officer, temporarily at least, with artillery and infantry for special service so soon as there has been time for the guns to arrive at Georgetown.
