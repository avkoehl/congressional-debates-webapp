Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff:

Major Dawson, inspector of pickets, reports that the appearance of the enemy's lines, their fires, &amp;c., are the same this morning as on previous days, but that there is less firing, which may be accounted for by the sharp cold of the morning and from the fact that the lines have been so near each other for several days.
