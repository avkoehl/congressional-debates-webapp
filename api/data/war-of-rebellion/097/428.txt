HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,Chief of Staff:

All quiet this a.m. along our lines. Slight cannonading yesterday afternoon. During yesterday small working parties of the enemy were engaged on different parts of the line, and some movements indicating a slight increase of strength on General Willcox's front, due probably to the story of one of our men who is reported missing. He was detailed as an axman for our contemplated movement. The usual amount of picket-firing was kept up through the night. Some deserters came in on both Generals Potter's and Willcox's fronts. Know of no movements of troops on our immediate front. Colonel Sanders reports all quiet along the rear line. He keeps his scouts well out. The First Massachusetts Cavalry scout and patrol the roads between the James and Blackwater, with headquarters at Prince George Court-House.
