Numbers 18.

Reports of Colonel Frank Wolford, First Kentucky Cavalry, commanding Cavalry Brigade (unattached).

PHILADELPHIA, [TENN.,] October 15, 1863.

SIR: This afternoon about 100 rebels attacked the wagon train of the Forty-fifth Ohio, 6 miles from this place, on the Cotton Port road; the wagon guard repulsed them killing 2. I sent re-enforcements of 300 men to the wagons.

The wagon train got in safe and the force is now pursuing the enemy below Sweet Water.

The enemy captured 2 of our men that were on the outpost, or straggling, some 4 miles from camp.

Our scouts report them coming in on all the roads; I believe, however, that it will turn out to be their scouting parties.

A negro man, just in, says he was taken from Knoxville by the rebels when there; that he left them day before yesterday close to Calhoun.

He reports that the enemy has crossed the Hiwassee in heavy force-cavalry, infantry, and artillery. He cannot give number.

I do not place much reliance on what he says.

WOLFORD,

Colonel.

General BURNSIDE.

PHILADELPHIA, [TENN.,] October 15, 1863.

SIR: Colonel Adams, First Kentucky Cavalry, is in hot pursuit of the enemy that attacked the wagons; when last heard from was 12 miles out, in the direction of Decatur. He sends in word that a force of 3,000 or 4,000 rebels are reported at Decatur, but cannot vouch for truth of the statement.

Nothing new from any other direction.

Have scouts on all the other roads.

WOLFORD,

Colonel.

General BURNSIDE.
