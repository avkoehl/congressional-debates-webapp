command. We are fighting in a holy cause, and should endeavor to deserve the benign favor of the Creator. Unless in the case of an attack by the enemy, or some other extreme military necessity, it is commended to commanding officers that all work shall be suspended on the Sabbath; that no unnecessary movements shall be made on that day; that the men shall, as far as possible, be permitted to rest from their labors; that they shall attend divine service after the customary Sunday morning inspection, and that officers and men shall alike use their influence to insure the utmost decorum and quiet on that day. The general commanding regards this as no idle form; one day's rest in seven is necessary to men and animals. More than this, the observance of the holy day of the God of Mercy and of Battles is our sacred duty.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

No new information since yesterday. Our train is out. Dispersed a small party of rebels near Cannelton on this side the river yesterday, and I have a party out scouting the country. It is supposed they got across the river by a canoe, as all the boats which have been found have been brought together under our own guard. Several scouting parties out with special instructions in regard to Floyd are expected in this morning. It is hardly safe any important dispatch by messenger down the river after dark.
