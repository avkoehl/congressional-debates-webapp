Major General J. HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps, Anderson's House:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you send without delay, to-night, one division through Snake Creek Gap to its southern terminus, with orders to watch well all avenues of approach from the direction of Dalton. This will leave McPherson full freedom for his operations without danger to his rear. You will also hold the other two divisions of your corps in readiness to move in the same direction upon receipt of orders to that effect. It is of the utmost importance that the division should be sent at once.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
