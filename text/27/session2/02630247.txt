time may amount, it is believed, to hundreds of thousands I
mention the fact with pride, because it speaks well of the miel
ligenceand diligence with which the business of the office is
transacted
"Independentof making up the&e records, which already
number some hundreds of very large volumes, closely written,
there are many other official duties devolving upon those em
plyed m the office of the House A vast amount of printing is
¡eft imprinted at the close of a session, and it often happens that
it is not completed for months, it occupies much oftlae time of
the chief clerk, and of one or two of the other clerks mauperm
tending the printing
"As soon as a session of Congress closes, inquines come in
from alt parts of the country as to what has been done upon
subjects which had been before the House Petitioners are
writing jU) ascertain the fate of their applications Copies of
papers are called for by individuals or departments Business
of this character is difficult and perplexing, and requires the
constant attention of tin chief clerk and of one or two of the best
assistants of the office
"The original papers of a session are to b° collected fiom
places where they are left by the carelessness or inattention of
those into whoac hands they may have passed during a session
The search is frequently earned beyond the walls of the Capí
tol They are all to be opened, examined, collated, and arranged,
and as there are many thousands of them, and upon every subject
that can possibly be imagined, it is labor requiring much care,
skill, and time When assorted and arranged, tbey are careful
ly packed in bundles, which areas carefully lettered and de
scribed on the back, so as that any paper may be instantly and
readily referred to when called for upon emergency
"The oiigmals, which are not packed away m bundles, are
arranged and laid OÍT, to be bjund m large volumes, classed ac
cording to subjects or the Departments fiom which they come
*( The printed documents ofa session are to be collated into
volumes, and full and copious indexes made, a woi k lequinng
skill, care, and capacity for its intelligent execution, as every
thing depends upon the indexes
"An index record is also made of all the petitions wh ch maj
have been presented, with all the pioceedmj-, had upon them,
and when it is consideied that they arpountto many thousands
it a session, some idea may be foimed of the magnitude of this
work alone
''Indeed, it is almost impossible accurately to define the cfu
ties of the clerks, theie is enough, and of short íecessesmore
than enough, to keep them mliy employed, and taking into ac
count the time they are < losely confined during a ¡session, over
and above the time devoted to business m any other office of the
Government, it is a fact which can scaicely be questioned, that
the clerks of Congress are employed a largei amount of time in
the course of the year than those of any >thei public office of
the country
1 In regard to that branch of the inquiry w hich calls upon me
to state whether the number of persons now employed under
my direction is necessaiy 'to the proper discharge of the pub
he service,' and whether the number can be reduced compati
ble with the public interest I have to state that I belnne the
number is necessary 'for the proper discharge of the public
business,1 and cannot be ledared compatible with the public
interest *
"The business oí the House i equinug ¡he aid of cleiks to dis-
charge it, has of late years ami indeed for the last twenty
years increased in a ra 10 much gi eater than the ir crease of

formerly

What were the ai umentsgneu them by th learned ^entle
man who stood at the he" 1 of the Select Commit ee ^

place, in it the I egi^tature of his own State ("Vimml hdn t
require so many deiks— that no State of the Union reonne 1 as
many, and yettheygotoneavil> with their duties AllthisheOIr
Eowne) granted, and yet all the clerks he behe\ ed, were re
quired here He would mention one single fact theie were
some mes,«in one single day, as many \ etitions presented m
this House as were presented id some estate Legislatures during
a whole session, and they had seen what the Clerk had to do
with them, there being six different entries of them to be made
Again, there were more reports made here in onp year than m
five or six years, perhaps, id any of the State Legislatures, and
these had all to be recorded, as well as the disposition of them
Here there was a perfect answer to the arguments of the gentle
man [Mr Summers] yesterday Another suggestion was made
by the learned gentleman, which did not seem to be borne out
by the facte reported, ii was, as the chairman supposed, that
thebe clerks m the recess, were employed solely m the disposal
of petitions
Mr SUMMERS said the gentleman had misapprehended—he
had adverted to a& the duties mentioned by the clerk in his
report
Mr BOWNE sai J he had not heard the gentleman very dig
tinctly, and he accepted the conection But he againa^ked,
how stood the caseí There was the report of the committee,
which shows that the cleiks had been faithfully working day
and night, and during the session the chairman of the commit
tee did not propose any reduction, for it was designed to give
the clerk authority to procure additional help the onty object
then was the salaries of twoolerksdunngthe recess This was
the statement asgiven by the committee itself Now much as
he respected the committee he was constrained to go for the
amendmer-t of his colleague3 and vote to íetain the two
clerks
A few words more, and he had done He regrette 1 that any
gentleman on that floor had thought proper to introduce the
subject of party politics into that discussion In his judgment
it was ill advised That the interests of those clerks, and of
the public m retaining them should be promoted by an appeal
to party drill, appealed to him to be ill timed and out of place
The question should be, Does the public interest require that
the^e clerks should be retained*? Are mofe employed than are
necessary todischarge the duties devolving on the Clerk of this
H( use, thiough himself and his agentst If theie are, cuitail
hem He went for íetrenchment, for the Treasury was ex
hausted and tbey had no money left wherev*ith to pay He
went for the doctrine so loudly piaised and |professed hut so
little practised He repeated that a partisan appeal was ill
advised, and he could assure his colleague (Mr Morgan] that
the le^s said on the subject and on the past action oí this House,
would be the best for his friends I he gentleman, [Mi Mor
c-an ] in allusion to his colleague, [Mi Gordon,] eaid it was
their vocation to opr ose re renchment, and that he expected
this because his colleague (.Mr Gordon] had opposed thp ap
pi opnation to Mrs Harrison at the **xtra session
Mr MORGAN explained He alluded to the expenses of the
funeral of the late President
Mr BOWNE said he accepted 'he explanation Well, then
why was it that these appeals were m rodured? Did not the
gentleman himself vote for that bill? Was he not in favor of
eivin"- every dodar that the committee proposed who reponed
it? He (Mr Bqw\e) ceitainly heaid but, \eiy few ol jections
to it and why should ¡us colleague [Mi "YTopgan] malve u the
surject of taunt to his colleague [Mr Gordon] foi opposing
what he deemed la\ ish expenditures
Mr GORDON said, in explanation I did not, as insinuated
by my colleague from the Cayuga dis'rict, [Mr Morgan] in
the debate on this resolution yesterday make a speech or
give a vote against the appropriation to defray the funeral
expenses of the late President Sa far from it, in my re
marks against the gratuity bill, grung $25 000 to the widow
Harrison at the extra session I distinctly stated that Congress
ought, and no doubt would out of t sense of decency and pro
priety appropriate a íeasonable sum to deftay those expenses,
and subsequently voted for it ?\ow, sn, my colleague was
here, and must have heard what I «aid on that occasion and
mu=t have been acquain ed with the fact of my having, by my
vote, «supported the measure which I had thuspieviously de
clared it bpcame Congress to adopt let sir on yesteidav,
in his lemaiks on the lOboluticn under consideiation without
the pretence or semblance of a s ngle fact on which to Inse

of tlio e who tuui| Uined of the exttavagances of the funeral
expenses of the late Geneial Harrison ' and imputed to me
a willingness c to rrowl over the grave for objects of economy
and retrenchment Having made this explanation, f-nd set
the matter right in point of fact, I leave it to my c Ileipne
to settle with his own sense of propriety, with what iegarl to
can lor or truth he made the imputation

Jhe sweatoftheir brow, their hard laboring and hard físíexi
^Then were to be disposed of, then they heard enough on she sub-
lectof retrenchment and reform, then the patriotism of his
colleage was waked up, and he could discover lavish expendí
tures How much did they hear during the late Presidential
campaign about the wages of labor"* Then the Democracy was
destroying the poor laborer—then that cry was heard on eveiy
mountain top, m every valley, and on every hill through this
wide empire, but now the first i eforra attempted here was a
blow aimed at the laboring man I e(. the gentlemen Opposite
introduce that system m other departmentSjand he(Mr Bowne)
would go with them hand ln hand He held m his hand a
statement of expenditures, which showed an outlay m
some of the Departments for costly chans on which to pit
down gold pens with which to decapitate heads, and news
papers, periodicals, and even a publication by Madame de
Stael, besides many books of poetry for the haad of the State
Depaitment Now let them curtailthoseexpenditures- ¡etihe
heads of the Departments understand by the action of die
House, that such expenditures of the public money are not to
be tolerated He was as senous ashis colleague to curtail ex
travagance where it existed, but for Heaven s sake, "hands
off" the little laboring boys and clerks who work, not only by
day but by night. Let not the first onslaught be made on i hen
laboring men Yet notwithstanding all this, he would go with
the committee if he thought the public interests would not
suffer by curtailing these laborers He repeated again, he did
not impute any thing wiong to the committee, but he believed
they had erred though with honest motives He believed,
however, that many suggestions had been made by- the commit
tee, f )r which they deserved the thanks of the country There
was one item of public printing in which they thought $14,000
a year could be saved and m the reduction of such expendr
tures thej should have his co opeiauon, and he r^gietted being
placed in a position of opposition to any curtailment coming
from any quarter, but he did it because he thought the service
ol these persons was uquired, and for his opuions he had
given his reasons
Mr MILTON FROWN followed Every man he sail,
whether Whig oi Democrat, was in theory sn ecunorm&t í ut
the difficulty was that the precipe point at which refoim should
commence could never be found Andheleared it i ever would
be found by a large number o( members on this floor feinee
his ears had been saluted with sounds on this subject, (wh ch
was as long as he could recol ect anv thing) every one had
been an economist but the misfortune was, that when any one
pointed out where economy should commence the lesponse
was, No, not here butin some otherplace And he feaied the
precise place never would be found
The evil of which this country complained was, not tl "tit
had been too liheral to i s soldier , u to t! e widow  oí tho e
who had seivedtheeountiy No the coirflairt had been that
the expenditures of the country had been enoimously lnciea&ed,
and no one could tell where
Mr B alluded heie to the gieatmcr ase of public offices
which had taken place in the various Departments pf the Co
vernment without autlionty of law, but which were «* d tobe
legalized by appioprmions fur their «alanés In this way it
was thatthopatronagpofthe Government had been extended
step by step to the pie ent enormous extent, and yet theie
sponsibility rested nowhere
Now, what had the Hou^e done"* It hal appointed a com

that thesc two offices at least were unnecessary Would tit
