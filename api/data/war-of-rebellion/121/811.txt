CITY POINT, VA., August 25, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I see by the Richmond Examiner of to-day that General Canby is about exchanging the prisoners captured at Fort Gaines. I hope General Canby will be instructed to make no more exchanges. It is giving the enemy re-enforcements at a time when they are of immediate importance to him.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 16, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

My order to send prisoners to Fort Monroe does not include the 500 sent to Morris Island.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 5, 1865-11.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Will you please say to the President that Lieutenant Markbreit has been released for exchange and is now on his way North.

Arragements for exchange of all prisoners are now complete and exchanges will go on rapidly. All but two of those who were in close confinement in Richmond are now on the steamer New York.

I am also in receipt of communication from General Hayes, acknowledging receipt of supplies of clothing for our prisoners, and the completion of arrangements for transportation and distribution.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

[Indorsement.]

This has the appearance of being a special case, but it was a trial case, persevered in with the view of securing the release of all of the same class, and which was accomplished.

E. A. HITCHOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commissioner of Exchange.
