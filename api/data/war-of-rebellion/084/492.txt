have been removed from here and I leave with headquarters in the morning. It lies with you to do something. A company has just got in to the Trading Post and I will send some of them down.

Brigadier-General McKEAN,

Paola:

Guerrillas got into Barnesville and south of the Osage this morning before sunrise. Reported 300 strong. Probably fifty. I have telegraphed Colonel Blair and ordered the militia company at Potosi, thirty strong, also thirty from Trading Post, to Barnesville. I think Company C, Fifteenth, should at once march for Potosi. I have ever looked upon the Little Osage country as unprotected, and wonder Colonel Blair don't see it. Please direct Company C if you agree with me. I will remain here until to-morrow.

T. MOONLIGHT,

Colonel.

Brigadier-General McKEAN,

Paola:

The detachment left here yesterday afternoon, owing to having no rations. There is nothing here in that line now. I have ordered out the militia company here, thirty-five strong. We will be more than vigilant, and hope to see company C to-night. Their baggage can follow, of course.

T. MOONLIGHT,

Colonel.

FREDERICKTOWN, July 31, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Sergeant Steakley, Company K, Third Missouri State Militia, just returned from a scout down into Bollinger Country. He met a squad of bushwhackers under one Smith, killed 2 of them, captured 7 horses and 2 revolvers. The sergeant had about an equal force with the rebels, but gave them a good whopping. He and his men deserve great credit for their conduct. The rebels were in the woods and fired on his command from behind trees and at a distance of less than forty yards, but he charged upon them and they fled. I am down here to get the people to reorganize; will do all I can.

Colonel, Commanding.

His Excellency Governor EVANS:

DEAR SIR: We are surrounded by Indians. How many we do not know, but various parties have been encountered at almost every point of the compass. A portion of our boys came in collision with some of them to-day, and captured six of them with their arms and ponies.
