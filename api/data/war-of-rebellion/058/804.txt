General RODDEY, Rome, Ga.:

Proceed at once to Dalton. In the opinion of General Johnston the delay in you movement is inexcusable.

Colonel JAMES WILSON,

Commanding Regiment, Chattahoochee Bridge:

COLONEL: Having been advised by telegraph from General Johnston to be very careful about our bridges and be very vigilant, I write to request,a nd beg to suggest, that if you can it would be well to have a good guard from regiment, if possible, placed under the bridge as well as over it, as it is most likely an incendiary would take advantage of the darkness of night to operate below rather than above. I have sent a small cavalry company just beyond the bridge to aid in guarding it, and trust that they may render some assistance. I write without any knowledge of your arrangements for guarding the bridge,a nd being only desirous of doing good for the service, I trust you will take the suggestions made in the spirit which prompts them. I will be glad for any suggestion you may give me, to aid in the better protection of our place with which I am charged, should we have any trouble. I expect warm work will soon commence at the front, when we in the rear should be doubly vigilant.

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.
