several States. Upon the latter branch of the
inquiry I am instructed by the Committee on
the Judiciary to report a bill entitled "An act
to declare and protect all the privileges and
immunities of citizens of the United States in
the several States." I move that this bill be
recommitted and ordered to be printed. I will
state that I intend to enter a motion to'recon-
sider the recommittal. I shall take this course
because, this being a bill of importance, mem-
bers may desire to examine it, perhaps discuss
it; and it would be impossible forme to afford
during the_ morning hour that time which I
desire to give to gentlemen, if they should ex-
press any wish to discuss the bill. I may state
that this bill is the substitute reported by my-
self during the last session for the bill intro-
duced by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Shellabarger,] being substantially the bill
introduced by him.
The motion of Mr. Wilson, of Iowa, was
agreed to; and the bill was recommitted, and
ordered to be printed.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I now move to
reconsider the vote by which the bill was re-
committed.
The SPEAKER. That motion will be
entered.
eight-hour system of labor.
Mr. NIBLACK. Idesireto take this oppor-
tunity to propound a question to the gentleman
from Iowa, [Mr. Wilson.]
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I yield to the gen-
tleman for that purpose.
Mr. NIBLACK. During the last session of
Congress several propositions (including one
submitted by myself) in regard to what is known
as the "eight-hour system" were referred to
the Committee on the Judiciary. I beg leave
to inquire of the gentleman whether the com-
mittee of which he is chairman intend at the
Sresent session to report anything to this
[ouse upon that subject.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I will state, Mr.
Speaker, that if the committee shall have suf-
ficient time to get through with their reports
one of the measures they will bring before the
House will be a bill on that subject.
Mr. NIBLACK. The gentleman will allow
me to suggest that the committee should at
least report back some one of the propositions
for consideration, even if the committee are
not prepared to make a recommendation upon
it, so that the House may take some action
upon the subject.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I believe I stated
during the last session that the committee had
acted upon that bill, and it will be reported if
we can have time to make the report.
Mr. NIBLACK. I so understood; and hence
I wanted to know the reason of the delay on
the part of the committee. I move that the
committee have leave to report upon that sub-
ject at any time when it will not interfere with
the morning hour.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I certainly have
no objection to that.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
the motion of the gentleman from Indiana will
be considered as agreed to. It requires unani-
mous consent.
There was no objection.

Mr. MORRIS, from the Committee on the
Judiciary, reported back, with a recommend-
ation that it pass, a bill providing for an addi-
tional term of the circuit court of the United
States in the eastern district of Arkansas.
The bill, which was read, provides in the
first section that a term of the circuit court of
the United States for the eastern district of
Arkansas shall be held at Little Rock, in that
district, on the second Monday in October an-
nually.

of the United States district judge for the dis-
trict of Arkansas shall hereafter be $4,000

_ Mr. MORRIS. I demand the previous ques-

January 23,
The previous question was seconded and
the main question ordered.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Does that increase
the salary of that judge, and how much ?
The SPEAKER.. Debate is not in order,
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I understand he
draws $2,500 now, and this increases it to
$4,000. It is a precedent to be followed in
the case of all others. I am opposed to it.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time.
Mr. MORRIS demanded the previous ques-
tion on the passage of the bill.

other purposes.''
The amendment was agreed to; and the-
title as amended was adopted. '

members under arrest.
The SPEAKER. The hour of one o'clock
having arrived, the Sergeant-at-Arms will now
proceed to execute the order made by the
House yesterday in regard to absentees from
its session. The Sergeant-at-Arms will pro-
duce at the bar of the House the members in
his custody.
Mr. ORTH. Mr. Speaker, the unpleasant
difficulties growing out of the proceedings
yesterday having been satisfactorily and honor-
ably adjusted, 1 presume there is no disposi-
tion on the part of the House to pursue this
subject any further. I therefore move that the
warrant of the Speaker in the hands of the
Sergeant-at-Arms be set aside, and that all
persons arrested by virtue thereof be dis-
charged, and on that I demand the previous
question.

The SPEAKER. The effect will be to dis-
miss the whole subject.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. Then I
withdraw the motion.

of order. There are some fifty of us that have

Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. I raise the

this moment; therefore the gentleman is not
entitled to speak.
Ms. ELDllIDGE. I rise to a question of
order. Gentlemen under arrest by the Ser-
