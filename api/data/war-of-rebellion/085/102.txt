Brigadier-General CAMERON,

Thibodeaux:

The general sends you this morning Henry Duker and John Newman, two men employed as guides for the La Fourche country. These men are thoroughly acquainted with the whole country in your front, and with their assistance the general thinks that you will be able to keep the country this side of Grand Lake clear of the enemy, and at the same time get a thorough topographical knowledge of the whole country. The general thinks that you should detail some competent officer as draughtsman. These men will be taken up on the rolls of the quartermaster at Thibodeaux at the rate of $100 per month and a ration from this date. When their services can be dispensed with they will be discharged.

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
