the battle was renewed, and we were ordered to the front. We formed line of battle on the south of the road, and advanced through an orchard and a parcel of timber. After having changed positions several times, took up our final position behind some hastily constructed barricades, our left resting on the Eighth Kansas Volunteers and right on the Twenty-fifth Illinois. We were not fully into our position when the enemy advanced on us from the timber on the opposite side of the field in our front ; when they got in short range, we fired and drove the first line back, but they soon advanced again with overwhelming numbers. We held our position until we were outflanked on the left, exposed to a raking cross-fire and almost surrounded, when we got orders to fall back. We then made a hasty retreat to the hill on the north side of the Chattanooga road, in which the battalion soon became scattered. At about 4 p.m. the brigade was sent to the rear.

Our loss on the 20th was:

Commissioned officers .................................. 3

Enlisted men............................................ 32

Our loss on the 19th.................................... 66

Total*.................................................. 101

Among our loss on the 20th was Lieutenant Colonel Ole C. Johnson, commanding regiment; Captain C. Gustaveson, company F, and Lieutenant O. Thompson, Company A, missing.

I had not the honor to command the regiment during the battle, as our lieutenant-colonel, Johnson, was not missing until we fell back from our last position on the 20th, but I observed that both

officers and men behaved bravely during the battle, and it is but justice to mention the following officers, who showed more than ordinary courage and bravery during the battle: Lieutenant Colonel Ole C. Johnson, Major George Wilson, Adjt. L. G. Nelson, Captain John M. Johnson, Company A, Captain H. Hansen, Company C; Lieutenant Simson, Company F, Lieutenant Clement, Company K, and Lieutenant Brown, Company H.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MONS GRINAGER,

Captain, Comdg. 15th Regt. Wisconsin Infty. Vols.
