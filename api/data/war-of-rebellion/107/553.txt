GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. GENERAL FOSTER'S BRIGADE, DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, No. 11. New Berne, March 17, 1862.

General Foster again congratulates his brigade on the brilliant victory in which they participated and by their steadiness and valor contributed so much to win, and renews most sincerely his thanks for the endurance of hardship, steadiness, coolness under fire, and willing, prompt obedience shown by all from the moment of landing. The test was more severe than at Roanoke Island, and as General Foster judged by their conduct of the brigade equaled or surpassed his expectations. He believes and hopes that each successive action will but add to the laurels won already by the brigade he is proud to command.

By order of Brigadier General J. G. Foster:

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
