Commanding Tenth Corps:

The signal officers report six trains of cars passed the Junction last night toward Richmond, and a train of fifteen cars loaded with troops passing in the same direction this morning at 6.45. Have a little reconnaissance made and see if there is any change of troops in your front. Have you any deserters?

Major-General BIRNEY:

The movement ordered last night has not been abandoned, but only postponed. Meanwhile let every preparation be made for it; the troops organized so as to move quickly and reconnaissances made so that officers may be instructed in the features of the country exactly over which they are to operate. Let this be done quietly, so as not to attract observation. Large bodies of troops are moving to Petersburg to-day. Large bodies moved toward Richmond early this morning and last night.
