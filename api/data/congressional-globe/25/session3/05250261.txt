MAINE BOUNDARY QUESTION
SPEECH OF HON. B. C. HOWARD,
OF MARYLAND,                             ,
In the House of Representatives,
March 1, 1839,
On the bill giv mg to the President -idditioml power for the
defense ot the United Stales S.c
Mi   HOWARD said that the remarks which
had fallen fiom the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania
[Mr  Biddle] requned that he should say some-
thin  in reply   But befoie I do so (said Mr H )
I will adveit for a moment to the amendment pro-
posed by anothei gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr Naylor,] which is the question immediately
before the House.    lie proposes to amend the
first section of the bill by inserting the woids,
"or the piovmcial authorities of Great Butain "
As if now stands it authonzes the Piesident to
resist any attempt on the part of Great Biitam
to enforce, by arms, an exclusive jurisdiction ovei |
the contested temtoiy   The effect of the amend- [
mentis not to íestiict thispowu in the Piesident, |
nor do I undeistand it to be so intended, but to i
define more piecisely the contingency upon the '
happening of wl ich the poweis gianted in tlie |
subsequent sections of the bill ate to become oper-
ative     But the piovmcial authorities of   Gieat
Britain camiotatlcmpt to < nfoice this jurisdiction
by ai ms, without doing it "on the pai t of Gie it
Butain," and thus the cabe piovidid foi  by the
pioposed amendment is alicady i cached by the
woids selected by the committee   Theie appiais
to be no necessity, therefoie, for any alteration
The intention of the commutee was, that all that
pait of the State of Mame wheie the piesent dis- '
turbances exist, should be protected ftom inva-
sion, let that invasion come fiom whatevci quai-
ter it might   As theie is no piospectof any attack
except with  a view to sustain the  juusdiction
claimed on thepaitof the Butish Government,
the phraseology adopted by the committee ap-
pears to meet fully the case undei consideiation,
and I hope that the bill may be allowed to sland
as it is
I have listened to the speech of the grntleman
fiom Pennsylvania [Mr Biddle] with suipnse
and legret, on account of the acknowledged m-
tclligi nee of the gentleman, and those lofty feel-
ings of patnotism and national honor which he
is know n to entertain His aiguments have been
(diefully consideied as he has piesented them in
his icmaiks, with a view to see how fai they
would justify the conclusion to which he came
If Iundeisund his position, it amounts to this,
and this only—that the Piesidt nt is not pistifir d
in assuming the ground which he has taken, and
that this House would not now be justified in as
suming the giound pioposed bv this bill, because
the administiation of Geneial Jackson petmuted
tlie question of this boundary to lemain dormant,
and theieby gave coloi to the pretensions now
advanced by Gieat Britain This is the extent
of the aigument Is it not' If I mistake it, I
beg the gentleman to correct me Let us examine
it There aie two points involved in it First,
the liibtoncal fact, as to the course of Gcneni
Jackson's administiation, and secondly, the in
ferences which can with propiiety be diawn
fiom that couise To sustain the fust giound, a
foimer argument of a gentleman fiom Maine [Vr
Evans] was piessed into the service in oidei to
show that the claim of the British Government
was acquiesced in, or not strenuously resisted by
General Jackson. But that same gentleman fiom
Maine has, within afewhouis passed,addiessed
the House upon this very point, and gone into a ,
minute examination of all the conespondence
which has ever taken place between the two Gov
ernmonts on the subject, the lesult of wlni li is
*h it no us i ant can oe found, in any p-iit of that
correspondence, for the ir-esciiuno.dmiss.ible claim {
of Gieat Butain That gent'eman [Mr Evins]
has íefeiied to his argument and explained it I-, I
he notable to undeistand his own aigument'
No one who hears him speak will deny to lnra
the power of understanding the arguments of
others, and it would be strange, indeed, if he
could not undeistand his own That argument
was made upon another question, and yet the
gentleman fiom Pennsylvania applies detached
parts of it to the one under debate, when the
author himself does not think proper so to use it
Again the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania [Mr
Biddle] refeis to some document emanating
fiom the Legislature of Massachusetts, and tians-
fers some of the positions taken therein, adopted
without sufficient means of investigation, to an
argument in a case where we can smvey tile en-
| tue giound We have before us the en tne coire-
spondence of the two Governments. Heietofoie
it was appiehended that a poition of it was kept
back, and in the part so retained it was feared that
our Government had admitted the British claim
to exclusive jut lsdiction But we now know that
no such admission was ever made, and what we
now know the British Government has known
all along There is, therefore, nothing m the doc-
umental y history of this affair upon which the
pretension of the Lieutenant Governor of New
Biunsvvick can rest
But let us suppose that the argument of the
gentleman fiom Pennsylvania is roirecf, and
that the administiation of General Jackson is to
bl ime
Mr BIDDLE The gentleman<"iom Maryland
knows that I expressly disclaimed any paiticular
lefuence eithei to the administiation of Geneial
Jackson 01 of Mr Adams in this mattei. I said
that that was a question wjneh I could not íaise
with any foieign Government, and that the sim-
ple question was, what was the language which
had been held out by any Administration ' Had
it been such as to had the Government of Great
Butain to believe that this light was conceded '
and, if so, was it propei to go to uai to set that
matter light' I said that if we believed we had,
in any way, misled the Butish Government in
this respect, it was a fair mattei of negotiation,
just as much as the ouguial question itself. The
gentleman knows that throughout this whole
debate, I have spurned from me aiything like
party feeling I spoke merely with reference to
the mode in which we should set the matter
light
Mi HOWARD I have no desire, Mi Speaker,
to en ite any false issue between the gentleman
fi oni Pennsylvania and myself. lam endeavoiing
to meet his aigument fauly, as it is with the logic
of his speech that I wish to deal. When we touch
a question involving the honor of the countiy, I
am sure the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania would
be one of the fiistto spring foi ward m defense of
that honoi I do not bilievp that we have in any
way misled the Butish Government The docu-
ments aie all befoie us, and wheie can any rea-
son foi such an opinion be found ' It is possible
that the BntHi Goveinment may have miseon-
stiued the action of ouis in the Madawaska ease,
and supposed that, because they weie pci muted
to cxeicise junsdiclion in that settlement, theie-
fore they could chim it upon the banks of the
Aioostook But the Madawaska settlement was
made by emigiants fiom N"ovn Scotia befoie the
Amencan Revolution, and.asfai as 1 know, there
has been an umnteriupted jurisdiction ovei since
by the Butish authoiities The course put sued
bv the United Statrs Governmental that case v. as
stnetly inconfoinuty with its present course and,
if the British Government has confounded the
two cases, it is its own eiroi The Massachusetts
document does not seem to be awaie of the dif-
ferent results which would be pioduced by ap
plying the same principle—that of uti possidetis—
to the facts relative to the Madawaska and Aioos-
took settlements But the Butish Government
had means of information which the Legislatuie
of Massachusetts had not, because not only the
entne conespondence, but also the icpoitsof the
conferences betw een the Mimstei s of the t\v o Gov-
ernments, must have been befon it Th'ie is
no in i_, upon ["coid, m my opinion, wlinh v.ifl
show 'hat our doctrine oi language h is ever been
inconsistent with the position n< vv assumed by
the Si eietary of State To letuin, h n«vi i, to
the ar<*umi n' of tne ge i'len in fiom Pe insylva-
nia, [Mi Biddle ] I still understand him to
maintain that, if the British Government had any
Here, then, was an appeal that might well come I
in aid of the same object, when urged upon the
Executive of the United States, in the second res- |
olution of the State of Massachusetts, in 1836 Yet
not the slightest notice appears to have been taken
of it; and the President now comes heie, in a
lluny, affecting to treat the pietention as a poi-
tentous novelty that had just dropped fiom the
•clouds; and we are asked suddenly to make it an
affair of immediate bloodshed.                                  I
But it is «aid that Mr. Fox has not consented to
spread out the reasons on which his Government
rests the pretension   And do you expect a subtile I
and accomplished diplomatist, in a case wheie S
delay ¡s itselfa positive gain, to answei imptomptu,
and thus dispose of a collateial issue that may, by
dexterous management, last for many yeais' He
is under no obligation to point out what stales
you in the face in your own lecords, if you will I
take the trouble to read them     He will be glad I
to shift the points of negotiation     The arrange-
ment signed by him may enable the British Gov-
ernment to take high ground, if our special mm
ister  shall discover  at Downing street, for the
ñrst time, that we have been  rather hasty in de-
nouncing Sir John   Harvey,  and   duving  that
functional y ftom lus stand under rather moitifying
ciicuinstances, in the face of the disaffected pop- ,
ulationundei his charge    Sir, do not believe that
we advance our case by refusing to view the sub-
ject in all its bearings     Now is the time foi ex-
amination.    When once engaged in war, I will
not consent to look back    1 shall go foi the coun
try.    Such was my feeling in the last wai, and
will be m the next   But let us not take our giound
rashly, and where the enemy might wish to place |
us.    It is the last degree of folly to suppose that t
there is any advantage in our blindly agreeing to
unite in a misstatement of the evidence, which
can be so instantly exposed    A candid and intel-
ligent people will lose all faith in us when our
blunders are pointed out by stiangers, after we
have involved them in a wai on false oi frivolous
pretexts.
What then, is ourcourse '    To run into a new
game of diplomacy  about " exclusive junsdic
tion'"    To shed American blood in an obseuie
and senseless contest on the Aioostook'    Doi s
honor requue that we shall compel the Piesident
to seek out, duiing the vacation, any Sir John
or Sir Andrew who may enter this disputed teru-
toiy with notions of duty which we have assisted
to put into his head, and before  we have en    |
deavored to obtain, in thepiopei quaitu, a mod-  I
ifi< ation of the auangement, such as Massachu-
setts, in 1836, entreated the   Pieside*it to effect'  |
Í cannot think so      We shall be wrong on any   ,
Buch issue     We aie right on the great one     Let   f
the Piesident bring it to a close     If he cannot,   |
let him scwiepoit and we shall then be ready for
the final   appeal  on broad punciples, which all
can undeistand     Mr  B  said that in the couise
taken on this occasion he had biaved what was
most foimidable to any man in publie hie—the
peril of misiepiesentation.    He was well awaie
liow much easier and cheaper it would have been
to runa race ofpiofessions about patnotism, &.c ,
than to take a course which thiew the explana-
tion of his conduct on an appeal to reason.    He
felt strong enough in the confidence of his constit-
uents to take the line which conscience dictated   I
They were a grave and quiet people, not given to
flourishes, nut there was a stein determination—
a deep-seated and vital piinciple of patnotism—
on which he could rely with more confidence     It
should not be through his agency that they got
entan^'ed in a lash and foolish war     He would
not commit them on pietexts which then  own
good sense and intelligence would find out, after   |
a vvhile, to be hollow and deceptive      But when   I
the cusís came, he knew that the sound to battle   (
would not fall on cold oi timid eais. he knew that
stout aims and brave heaits  would rally from  i
