DIPLOMATIC   AGENTS
On motion of Mi FILLMOKC, the House resolved ltselhnto
Committee of the Whole on theatre ol the Union, (Mr Mason
of Ohio in the chair > and took up the bill making appropua-
tions for the sajanesandoutfits of diplomare agents, which
had been returned from the Senate with an amendment striking
out the Neapolitan mission, and consequenily reducing the
■mount appropriated mine bill from the bum of 863,000 to the
sum of $58 500,
And the question being on concurring with the Senate in
their amendment
Mr GU&HING, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Re
¡a ions, said ho hoped the House would not concur in the
amendment proposed by the Senate and which went to abolish
the mission to Naples altogether He was of opinion that that
mission ought to be retained As he had airea ly, on a former
occasion, presented to a certai i extent his views onthesubject,
he Bhould not enter on it now, unlets some opposition should
be made
Mr McKEON stated that he would move a concurrence He
wasopp ibed to the whole system o foieign ministers perm.)
nently fixed at foreign couits an! he was happy to have this
opportunity of making an effort tgainst a p rt of this anti re
publican system The Hiuse might íememberíhat on a for

the place of the piesont officer (Mr Ttnoop ) I or tint gen
tlemanhehad the highest regard and he (Mr McK)wasnot
aware of any charge biought against that gentleman He
knewof no reason why he should he recalled This was not
the time—when the present guardians of the public Treasury
appealed to the Representa ives of the people (oi retrench
ment and reform for years past, and at last suri eeded in o!>
taining powei—when thib House had passed bills to borrow
money to fill our Treasury—this was not the time to increase
public exoetiditurts
[The Picsident s Secretary having now made hie appearance,
and diere be ¡ig great anxiety in expectation of a ve o message
Mr McK was interrupted by fiequent cries of ' Ciue&tion'
question i']
And, on motion of Mr CtMIING,
The committee here rose to receive a message from the Pre
sMent of the Tinned States, transmitted by ti e hands of Robert
TYLSS,esq his Secretary
The President informed the House that he had approved and
«filed the following Bills
The Ml making appropriations for various fortification ,
for ordnance, and for preventing and suppressing Indian hosti-
lities,
The bill granting the flanking ptivilege during life to
Mrs   Harrison, widow of the late Presideut of the United

the belter collection, salekeepmg and disbursement of the pub
lie revenue, by means of a corporation, to be styled the Fiscal
Corporation of the United States," which, on motion of Mr
UNDERWOOD, was read
The message having been read,
Mr MORROW rose and moved that the message#be entei
edon the Journal, and he punted lor the use of the House
and that the House to morrow, at twelve oclock, proceed
"reconsider the bill" This, he said, was the language
of the Constitution, and he found, on investigation, that
this course was in accordance with the practice m former
cases.
The motion was immediately agreed to
DIPLOMATIC AGENTS
The House again resolved itself into Comm ttee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, Mr Mason of Ohio,
m the Chair, and resumed the consideration of the bill
making appropriations for the salaries and outfits of diplomatic
agents
Mr McKEON continued and concluded his speech in favor
of concurring with the Senate's amendment striking out the
item for a mission to Naples
He (Mr McK ) regretted that he was not present when hie
friend from Pennsylvania [Mr Ingersolx.] moved to strike out
this appropriation He supposed, from the report he saw of
thatgentleraan'sremarks, that the member from Pennsylvania
was m opposition to the system If he was, the support of Mr
McK would be most cheerfully given in such areform Icon
fess I go for a reform of this anti Republican system, and am
willing to show my devotion by my votes, not my professions
He had one view he wished to present on this appiopnation
Why was Mr Throop to be stricken down? What had he
done in his capacity of Charge? Was he guilty of malcon-
duct? Were Democratic Republicans—New Yorkeis—from
which State that gentleman came, willing to sacrifice him?
Were they willing to cast censme on the past Admmistiation,
who appointed him, and kept him at Naples? Were Demo
cratic Republicans— the advocates, the avowed advocates of
an economical Administration—to expend money when no re.
suit beneficial to the country could be expected? He had heard
somethmgabout a treaty bemglikely tobemide with the Nea-
politan Government by our representative If so, why do we
want to change the present agent? As for himself (Mi McK ) he
doubled vei y much if we were likely to make any treaty The
matter had been talked of for years past, and was likely to be
talked of for years to come Moreover, the Neapolitan Go-
vernment did not deem lis worthy of the reciprocity system m
this matter When he (Mr McK ) objected, some time since,
to these appropriations for permanent ministers, he was told if
we did not «end ministers to foieign courts, the heads of foreign
king-ioms would not send representatives here Very well, sir
The United States would not lose by this But in the case of
the Neapolitan Government, there was no representative here
They had, he believed, a Consul General, but no officer of the
grade we propose to keep at their court How could gentle-
men who were stickleis for etiquette consent to this arranee
ment? He (Mr McK ) had no feeling on this point, but ho be
lieved some of the supporters of the system insisted on such
points
The gieat object of Mr McK was to call the attention of the
country to the system Heiewas an opportunity for refoim
which was worthy of most serious attention Let not our at
tentlon be turned to retrenchment on pens and paper, or pnn
ters—against which no voice was raised—while we can strike
at this system of foreign ministers—one of the most fiuitful
sources m the hands of any Executive, of patronage calculated
to catch the leading man of the countiv The visions offo
reign courts dazzle then e\es H" wished to break up this
source of Fxecutive power Mr Jefferson w<is the model
which he (Mr McK) wished to follow Mr Jefferson wished
the people of this country to live wuhm themselves The fa
thers of this Government never intended to make aur agents
abroa 1 permanent mi istors, m imitation of the representatives
of loyalty They believed it proper tosend agents to make
airangement about commercial matters with' foreign Go
vcinmenls, and as soon as their business was conclnled
to return to their homes Even now he (Mr McK ) would
cheerfully sustain appiopnations for diplomatic agents, where
tl ere was any thing to do The wants ofcommeice, if they re-
quired negotiation should have proper agents Foi himself,
he thought our consuls could do all the countrv needed We
then should have none of our countrymen retnrnme to the
country with their eyes dimmed with the splendid visions of
royal splendor He desired to brng the a 1mm s'ra ion of oui
Government to that simplicity which its framt i s originally de
signe 1 Thai simplicity would preserve the ennnfry and be m
i onaonance with the tastes the feelings, and character of our
peonl He vas for malting i beginning now, and should con
cm m the Senate's amendment
Mr CUSHING entered into a buef reply He shou'd not
notice the argument for tl e antiquated doctrine which opposid
all permanent diplomatic mtercouise with foreign nations, be
canso uneei'el no reply And as *o the aigummt that Naples
had v > minister here and therefore we were houn 1 to have
none at that Court,it went on an entire misconcepi ion of the object
of out diplomacy The case of Naples was in this ícspectnot
peculiar There were five other foingn missions to countries
which sent no i epresentatlve to us And the ressm of this was
to he found in the fart that fsreign missions wi re established
not as matteis of etiquette or of íe pect to other nations, but
rhiefivwith a Mew to piomote the advantage of hiscoitnliy
The mission to the Court of the Two Sicilies waj of this cha-
racter The commerce of the United States with Naples was
conducted m our own veseels and our swn productions It was
to our advantage to continue and increase it and to draw the
ties of friendly intercourse more closely. If the manciples of
retrenchment and economy were to be brought to bear on any
department of the Government, certainly that department was
the verv last, which had not been unreasonably extended—m
which there were no anuses and no defalcations   If the gentle
H man was honest in his cry for retrenchment, let him go with it
into departments where reform was needed
In leply to an appeal made by Mr McKeon to the New
York Democrats, not to vote an appropriation the effect of
which was to supersede Enos Throop, aeainst whom no
chaige was brought, Mr C reierred to the fact ihat Mr Throop
had been honored with this mission, and permitted to retain it
two years, after it was oublicly obiected to him that he had, bj
his ulter negligence when an officer of the custom house in
New York, permitted, if not winked at, the defalcation of Mr.
Swartwout, which could not have occurred had Throop done
his duly Instead of wearing those diplomatic ho ors abroad,
he should have been here, demanding an investigation into the
charges against him, and purging his character from official
accusation                         ,    ,      ,               ,  , „   _.
Mr McKEON inquired whether the removal of Mr Throop
was put by the Administration on that ground?
Mr CTISHING did not answer for the Administration; he
spoke of what he knew At least, so far as the evidence pre-
sented to his notice went, it was all in support of the truth of
the charge The gentleman from Nonh Carolina [Mr Stab-
ly] had more than once referred to the case, and demanded an
investigation of it
As to the expediency of continuing the mission, Mr C went
into a general argument in us favor, íeferring to what he had
before said, reletting to the almost intolerable burdens to
which our commerce with Naples was now subjected, and to
the piobablhty, some time since, that a commercial treaty
would be effected The Neapolitan Minister under whom this
arrangement seemed almost completed, had fallen into disgrace
with his Sovereign and been removed from office, which sus-
peded the negotiation but he had recently been restored, and
the last advices held out the prospect of a renewal of them with
fa  hopes of a successful issue
Mr C insisted thatthis was, of all points of time, the most un-
suitable to break up the mission
Mr STEENROD pressed for the quesiion, expressing some
desire to speak upon it, but willing to waive the floor if the
question could be bad
Amidst loud cries for the question-
Mr WISE had a word to say before the question was taken;
and he would not make the remarks he was now called upon
to make, but for the fact that his friend from Massachusetts
[Mr Cushino] was not properly attended to The member 
weie somewhat excited, order was not preserved and he did
not think this question was fully understood This House
made an ap propnation for a Chai ge d'Affaires to Naples, toge-
gether with some other missions embraced in the I íplomatic
bill, as it went to the Senate. The Senate has seen fit to strike
out that appropriation Upon what grounds the -enate under
took to distinguish that to Naples from the number of mis-
sions provided for in the bill, he .could not conceive, except
from what appeared in the public prints It seemed, however,
that the Senate was influenced chiefly by the consideration that
therewasnoiepiesentalivcof the court of Naples here in re-
turn for our representative there We have been represented
at Naples since the year 1816, and we have no representative
from that Court here, and thus, upon amere point of etiquette
alone,thisappropriationhasbeenstrickenout Now, what is
our position among the nations of the earth W e have business
with all of them We have business at ihe court of Naples,
and particularly so because we have Wd no treaty with it
but the treaty of indemnity There are powerful reasons why
we should negotiate, if possible, a commercial treaty Our
trade with that nation, as we are told by the documents lately
received from the State Department, is an indirect trade It is
a trade that has to pass through England and Leghorn, and is
oneroub and vexatious in the extren e We eitffti in our naval
intercourse from their quarantine laws, and we suffer from their
regulations asrespects our rice, cotton, tobacco, and fish Every
pc rtlon of the United States is at this time inteieeted in having
a treaty with Naples, and with a trade exceeding m silk and
wine alone some 8b00,000 per annum shall we cease
to transact our business with Naples, abandon the benefits of a
commercial treaty, simply because this point of etiquette is not
preserved? He was proud that in this respect the United States
was emphatically the Yankee nation ( f the earth, and wholly
disregarded points of etiquette in puisuit of their business or
interests if we have business with any nation, we go to them
if they will not come to us and unfolding our papers, sit down
and tell what we want That is the way for a business nation
to act He cared not whether Naples ever sent a minister
here, but if she does not, and eives to other nations commercial
advantages over us, if there is any benefit lively to be gained by
if, he would send a minister there He would never
sacrifice the intere&ts and business of the nation to mere
etiquette The gentleman from Massachusetts had clearly
shown the nature of our relations with Naples, and had demon
strated that we required a minister to that Court more than to
any otbei The negotiation for a commercial trtaty that was
commenced by Mi Davezec, and continued by Mr T hroop,
was broken ortin corsequerce of the disgrace and exile of the
mnkterwith whom it was commenced—Mr Pizatio whowas
suspected by the King to have had some agency m producing
the difficulties with Lngland, on account of me sulphur trade
That m nister had now returned and was a^am m favoi, and it
was supposed that, at this moment, a commercial treaty, favo-
rabie to the United States, mightbe negotiated
Without at all intending to en'er into tic merits of Mr
Throop, he was sorry that his friend fiom New York [Mi Mc-
KlonI had alluded to the fact that we already had a representa
tive at Naples, as a consideration why the mission should be
destroyed This was the first time that such an argument had
ever been offered on that floor, that, because the Executive
might think proper to clwige the minister, the appiopnation
should not be made Mr Throop mightbe worthy or not, com-
petent or not competent, bu  if it has pleased the Executive to
nominate another person any one inclined to deal justly with
the Administration would not withhold the appropriation.
With the gentleman from Massachusetts he would
say thatifthemisMon to Naples was stricken out, he saw no
íeaaon why six oi s-ven othei missions should not be stricken
out on the same principle There were six or seven foreign
courts (naming thetn,( which had no representative here, and
should we recall our representatives from the whole of them
on this mere point of etiquette? Were gentlemen prepared to
carry out this principle? The United States had, in the short
period of their existence as a nation, become the second com-
mercial power on earth; or, at all events, the third ¡fnot the
second Our commercial marine was at this time our most
important interest, and consequently, instead of there being
