be spared from duty in the district. I shall know in the course of five days whether I can spare any troops or not. S. H. Boyd will be colonel of the six-months' regiment. Godely will be allowed to remain with his company near where he is or at Berryville, and will be armed as the balance of the regiment is armed (good infantry arms), and be entitled to the pay and allowance of other U. S. soldiers. The men are likely to remain in the service any way for this length of time, and it is better that they should be in the U. S. service. Have him enlist with his company, if possible. Send word to Bowlin that troops will be sent to help him within six days if any can be spared from the district with safety.
