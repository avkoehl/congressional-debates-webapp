but the others pressed toward. I left the few men I had halted under an officer, and pressed on after the remainder of the regiment, but I went half a mile before i overtook them; they had passed over two formidable works, and assisted in taking several pieces of artillery. Colors of the Twelfth Alabama Regiment were about the first in the breastworks. When I joined them, I found not only my men, but officers and men from every regiment in the brigade. Being the senior officer and men from every regiment in the brigade. Being the senior officer present, I formed them all (those from other regiments also) into line, and marched them back about half a mile, where a portion of the brigade had already been formed, that being the place we were ordered to form. The brigade commander soon formed the brigade into line, and marched us into camp for the night.

About 6.30 a. m. on May 3, the Twelfth Alabama Regiment was formed into line of battle and ordered forward with the remainder of the brigade. The brigade formed a part of the third line of battle. We had advanced about a mile when we came up with the second line of battle; this we passed. We passed over the wooden breastworks in the woods on the extreme left of our lines, and advanced near the first line of battle, which was then engaging the enemy. We were soon flanked, and fell back to the breastworks.

Learning here that Colonel [E. A.] O'Neal had been wounded and had left the field, and not seeing Colonel [J. M.] Hall (next in command), I immediately formed my regiment and portions of the Third Sixth, and Twenty-sixth Alabama, and determined to hold the works, if possible. Learning from skirmishers that the enemy were advancing perpendicular to the breastworks, endeavoring to flank the works and turn our left, I immediately reported the fact to General Iverson (who just then came up), and asked for orders. He ordered me to form the portion of the brigade I was commanding perpendicular to the breastworks, right resting a the works. The brigade was not long in this position before our forces again advanced from the breastworks, leaving me to protect the flank. The enemy was soon seen advancing in heavy force. I allowed them to advance within musket-range, when Is opened on them. i held them in check for over an hour, until the ammunition was nearly

expended-a great many men had fired all their cartridges- when I was relieved by General Colquitt.

The brigade acted very gallantly, and fought desperate. During the time I held the enemy in check, they we re-enforced three times. After being relieved by General Colquitt, I retired to the rear for ammunition, and did not again enter the fight.
