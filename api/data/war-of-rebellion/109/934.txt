RICHMOND, May 15, 1864.

GenerL G. T. BEAUREGARD:

Whiting is urged to join you earliest moment with his whole force. It is hoped you may receive hm in time to attack to- morrow. Time is all important to us, as the enemy gains more by delay than we possible can. Sheridan's cavalry, with re- enforcements, will agin threaten the city very soon, which is almost stripped of troops to aid you.
