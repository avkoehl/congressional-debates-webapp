G. W. SCHOFIELD,

Lieutenant Colonel and Chief of Arty. and Ord.m, Dept.of the Ohio.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 16, 1864.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 16, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

I need a good cavalry brigadier very much, and recommend Colonel Eli Long, Fourth Ohio Cavalry, now here, and who merited promotion for good service the time I went to Knoxville. He is a junior colonel now, and the cavalry is not commanded to my satisfaction.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, August 16, 1864- 10 a. m.

General SHERMAN:

Saturday night last I threw the Second and Tenth Corps, with a division of cavalry, to the north of the James River, for the purpose of employing the enemy and keeping him from sending off any of his forces, and to make him recall some from the Shenandoah Valley, if I could. We have kept him constantly occupied since, and prisoners report with very heavy loss. Two general officers have been killed and their bodies left in our hands. I shall keep the enemy so employed that he will not send troops to Atlanta.

Yours,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant- General.
