from equal taxation, similar article?, the growth or
manufacture of this country, amonsst which are
silks. The taxing system, since 1816, has been une-
qual, and has fallen heaviest on the day laborer
and farmer, for whom these objectors all at once
affect so much sympathy. After the 30th June,
1842, by the compromise act, the taxation will be
reduced and equalized—the whole system of the
revenue Uw will be reorganized, in this revision
of the laws, duties can be so laid as to operate
equally on all, and raise enough for the purposes of
Government, and no more, and thereby leturn to
the system adop'ed from 1789 to 1816.
Another objection i*, that the bill enables office-
holders to receive gold and silver; and this fur-
nishes one kind of money for them and another for
the people. This is like all other objections, with-
out foundation. There never has been, and there
cannot be a time, without altering the Consti-
tution, when officers could not demand' and
hate, gold and silver from the Government;
and so with all o'her creditors; but the bill makes
it imperative to pay to all, the same kind of
money which is received. Who are these cffice
holder^ Are they above the people? This ob-
jeción assumes fiey ate, but the tact is net so.
Offices of this Government are selected by, tr ap-
pointed from amongst the people, and they and their
families need support as others do; for money they
must pay, and thus they send back into circulation
what was received from the Government. If offi-
cers could live without eating or wearing, and
hoard op their salaries, there might be some grounds
for the objection;, but in this country it happens
otherwise, and few who are either cffice holdeis cr
cffice seeker1, lay up nvney by it. They too fre-
quently spend alt they receive and need more.
Another objection is, that the system will lock
up, and keep from circulation, a large amount of
specie, and thus reduce the circulation in the
country.
This is like all other objections when exposed. The
whole amount which passes through the Go-
vernment is estimated this year at less than
[$28,300,000,] twenty-eight millions. This is re-
ceived and disbursed quarterly, and only one-
fourth of the sum is required every ninety days,
which is seven millions of dollar.'; and if nothing
was going out, until the end of the quarter it would
be ninety days in gathering, and at the end of that
time be thrown oat into circulation again. But
the fact is, that the money is as constantly going
out, as it is coming in, and cannot be kept from
circulatim even for ninety day, and certainly no
longer; if any amount, certainly not more than
[|5,000,000] five millions, can at any one time ac-
cumulate. And is this to outweigh the much
greater objection there should be to giving the
public money to be used by individuals for their
own advantage ? or is it as dangerous to lib-
erty as the principle of taxing three-fonrths
for the benefit of one-fourth? Again, how does
this objection comport with the practice of the
banks, that now have and keep locked up from cir-
culation more than one-third of all the specie in the
country? The tendency of the objection, like every
other, is evident, as well as its futility.
Another objection is, that the public money will
not be secured by thi.« system. This is an asser-
tion without proof, for it has been admitted by
Opposition gentlemen on this floor, upon other oc-
casions, and is what all know, that the insecurity
does not arise whilst ihe money is in the Treasury,
bat when it is coming in and going out—in being
received and disbursed. That you cannot dispense
with officers in these operations, I have shown; and
have we greater insecurity from them than if the
money was kept in banks? It will not be pretend-
ed that officers selected from among the American
people may not, and will not, be fonnd as hone-st
and as capable to keep the public money in the
same kind of vaulis and safes, as banks,and their offi-
cers, such as cashiers, clerks, and tellers. Aside
from the experience which the country has had
from suspensions, by reference to the table, giv.
ing the number of banks, &c. it will appear that,
frota the commencement of the Government, of
the whole number of banks, there have been fail-
ures, beside suspensions, of one for every seven and
, a half of their number—amongst these, the Bank of
the United States, in 1819 and 1820 and  in  1839>
being as miserable as any other.
Now, I inquire, whether the same proportion in
numbers ot any other class of institutes or per-
sons, whether merchanis, mechanics, farmars, or
professional men, have failed? An examination, 1
believe, will show that the etitire failures amongst
the banks, have been greater in proportion to their
numbers, than of any other interest, pursuit, or
class of persons, and shows that the public money,
especially with the experience of the suspension ot
1837, is not more safe with banks than with other
persons, and meets the objection almost to demon-
stration, that the public money is at least as safe
under the proposed system as it has been, or would
be, with one or with many banks.
Another objection is, that it will force the specie
out of the country, through commercial operat.ons.
This is incorrect. But in connection with the compro-
mise act, after 1842, it will produce precissly the re-
verse. The credit heretofore allowed to importers,
which ends in 1842,and allowing them.when they did
pay, to do it in paper, tended greatly to in-
crease the excess of imports. The importer need
not make provision for paying his duties, but ordi-
narily cou'd sell and raise his pay, before the cie-
dit on his bonds expired, pay his duties in such pa-
per as he received and balance his aceount with
specie, or other lunds for a foreign market.
Thus the importer could raise hi* means in this
country from his good--, whe her he was a citizen
or a foreigner, and the facility of doing this depend-
ed entirely en the amount of paper circulation. Af-
ter paying his duties in such paper as he received,
the balance could be converted into specie to carry
wuh him, if a foreigner, or into something equally
good; and if a citizen, to remit to the port from
wh ch be shipped. Every dollar thus sent away,
took away so much basis of the paper circulation,
and iF the banks had in circulation three dol-
lars of paper, for one dollar in speci-*, in their vaul s,
every dollar taken away in specie, reduced the pa-
per circulation three dollars, because when the
specie basis was removed, the paper had nothing on
which to rest, and must necessarily be called in;
when this operation was going on, it efftcted the
country,as in the last three monthsof 1839,when there
was drawn from this to foreign countries upwards
of four millions of dollars, which was so much spe-
cie basis, and in the condition of the paper circula-
tion in this country, compelled the banks to contract
at least twelve millions, or many ot them fail.
Under the operation of this system after 1843, the
importer will ha?e to provide his duties in specie,
before he lands his goods. If a foreigner, he will
do this in the country from which he comes if a
citizen, he will do it here; but in either event, the
amount of imports will be regu'ated by the specie
basis of the country of each resident, and not by the
paper circulation of this; thus, more than any and
all other causes together, preventing excessive im-
ports or fluctuations in this country, from commer-
cial operations.
The last objection which I shall notice, is, that
this measure is a war upon the banks, destructive
to credit, and prostrates commerce, manufac-
tures, agriculture, and labor. This has been much
relied upon by the Opposition, and especially by the
gentleman from Massachusetts. The objection is
got up and urged, by assuming before the commit-
tee and the country, that the day laborer, the far-
mer, and the agriculturist, each depend upon ma-
nufactures and commerce—that these last are inti-
mately connected with, and rely upon banks and
bank credit—that these institutions, and their means
to afford this credit, rest in allowing them a con-
nection and inflnence with the Government,
through the use of its money, in depositing with
them or receiving their bills. It presents the relation
in which the Opposition in ihis House, and their
leaders throughout the country, place the different
classes of interests and people in the United States,
and the principles of that party. When analyzed, it
amounts to what was asserted by the gentleman
from Massachusetts, that the great paramount in-
terests in this country, are commerce and manufac-
tures, and makes the banks the grand lever which,
by the power derived from the use of the public mo-
ney, moves every thing else: withhold this iw«, and
all is prostrate and lifeless,   The error of the ob-
ection is in the assumption on which it rests. It is
not irue that enher commerce or manufactures are
the paramount interest of this country, or
that their true prosperity depends upon the modern
system of bank circulation. Where are our day la-
borers, mechanics, *nd artisans? Are they not
found in the great importing cities, the towns and
villages, upon the public woiks, on every hill, and
in every valley ot this fertile and variegated land?
And are not these m every country, but more es-
pecially in this, they whose productive labor is the
nation'-, wealth* Where ate the hardy fishermen
upon your rivers and along your coasts, who draw
subsistence for thermelves and thousands of the
human family from the watery element? Where
are your woodsmen of the Norihern and Eastern
States, that furnish materials for your navy, and
for export, from the forcsis. Where is the provision
growing interest in the great Valley of ihe Missis-
sippi, which supplies ihe deficiency in all othersec-
uons of the Union, besides other portions of the
world, with ihe staff of life? Where is the agri-
cultural interest proper, which in Maryland, Vir-
ginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, proluce tobacco; and,
in the mere Southem States, vast quantities of cot-
tun, which go abroad to equalize and pay the
oalaoce of your imports ? Wnhout the culture of
cotton and tobacco, you would have nothing, com-
paratively, to pay or exchange abroad, and your
ships remain useless, and your sailors unemployed.
Without the provision growers in all secions of the
Union, the people would go unfed: and ihe gold
and silver which comes from South America and
ihe West Indies, in rpturn for exports of flour, beef,
and pork, from Western Pennsylvania, Western
Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and
Missouri, would cea^e to find its way to the import-
ing uties of Boct, on, New York Fhiladelphia, and
Baltimore, there to constitute, a  it now does, the
basis of bank issues and of true commercial credit.
And vi'hout the laboring classes spread over the
Union, the importer and manufacturer would have
no consumer of their good*, and no source from
whirh to receive their profits.
