In 1S34 the expenditures in this branch of the
public service were about $200,000 greater than
in 1Q33. This increase w as principally occa-
sioned by the rebuilding and repairs of vessels,
and the addition made by law to the pay of offi-
cers during a part of the jear.
5. Payments on accost of Foreign Inter-
coirse,
"Were about $600,000 less in 1834 than in the
preceding year, that sum having been paid in
1-\13, under awards in the treaty with Denmaik.
Besides this item, the expenditure was about
$511,000 less.

Expenses op 1835.
The general expendituies of 1835 are very
similar to those of 1834. But, from the session
of Congress being a short one, and there being no
appropnations forthe fortifications, the payments
under these heads were of course mach ks^, and
the aggregate expenditures of the vear lowei by
over half a million.
Expenses hereafter.
The annual expe nditure for ordinary purposes
might be brought down to §14,000,000, wire the
expenses of all connected with the military es-
tablishment placed on the footing of ten or twelve
yeais ago; the miscellaneous expenditures re-
stricted as at that period,and the naval, civil, and
miscellaneous appropriations not greatly enlarged.

The details in the fotegoing statement may,
from the number of selections forming them, not
be altogetln i coneet, the geneidl results aie
deemed comet.
The in \t fact upon which the honorable gen-
tleman fiom Tennessee bases his charge of the
coiiupt tiiulency of tlu piaetiecs of the Govem-
nient, is the connection of tlie Government with
the public press. The gentleman sav s that the
Government has an annual fund of «6,30,000 at its
disposal, for the purpose of being employed m
the publicatinn of the laws, Goveinnii lit piopo-
sals, ác, and that with this fund, the Govern-
ment subsidizes the pn ss, nidkt s> it subservient
to Us view s, and thus contiols public opinion. It
is true, Mr. Chan man, that the Government has
this fund appropualidtoit annually by Coiigiess, at
its command, which is employed m pajiugl'oi
the publication of the laws, proposals for carry-
ing the mails, supplies for the Army and Navy,
&c; but tins, -u.is a work of necc ssity, and
cannot be dispensed with. The Government
must either use the columns of existing news-
papers, or employ a press of its own; the laws
must be disseminated, as well as proposals for
contracts; and there is no moans by which it can
be so extensively and succc ssfully done, and, in-
deed, there is no other practicable mode in which
it can be done, except through the medium of the
press. The Government, then, must of necessity
employ the public press. If the sum appropriated
be too large, Congress has the power and should
reduce it; if not, then there is no cause of com-
plaint. In making the selection it is but natural
to expect, if there be rival presses at the point se-
lected , that the Executive, would select the press, all
other circumstances being equal, which is friendly
to it; this is a feeling attached to humar nature
which does not die xvith incumbents in office; it
is a feeling which should be approved rather than
reprobated, for all of eveiy party act upon the
principle of preferring a friend to on enemy. I do
not approve of a change for mere opinion's sake,
without any other cause; but it is making á very
small allowance, indeed, for the infirmities of
human nature, to suppose that the Government
would or ought to continue its patronage of a
press, in the constant habit of traducing and vil-
ifying its administration. This is rcquning the
Government to do what no man here would do.
I deny, howi ve i, toto ccelo, that the Administra-
tion lias employed any press, in which the laws
and proposals arc published, to vilify and abuse
any man. I deny that it is in any wise respons-
ible for the editorial or other articles in such
papers. The editors are free—they conduct their
papers in their own way, and are individually
responsible.
The honorable gentleman charges that a copy of
what he calls the semi-official paper in this city
was sent to each of the members of the Legisla-
tures of Tennessee and Alabama, during the last
fall, franked by the President, in which was con-
tained an article copied from another journal, of
a very offensive chaiacter, to Judge White; and
this he charges as an abuse of the patronage of
the press. I do not believe that the Piesidcnt
siwor knew of that article when he franked the
papers alluded to. He had a far different and
more important object in view; one which was
and ought to be very near his heart. The papers
fianked contained the speech of Mr. Benton in
! the Senate of the United States upon the resolu-
tion to expunge from the Journal of that body
I (whether properly or not, I shall not here under-
take to discuss) its resolution charging the Pres-
ident with violating the laws and the Constitution
in the removal of the public deposits from the
Bank of the United States; a resolution as unau-
thorized by the Constitution as it was defamatory
to the character of the President. The President
was deeply solicitous that the imputation stamped
upon his character for an act which had been
decisively sustained  by an   overwhelming ma-
I jonty of the American people, contained in the
Senate's resolution, should be obliterated or ex-
punged from the Journal by a decisive mark of
reprobation. For this purpose he appealed to
the people of his ow n State—that people for
whom he had done so much, for whom he had
made so many sacrifices, and with whose char-
I aeter   their  own   was   so intimately  idenlified.
j This, sir, induced the frank of tin pipers refer-
red to; and I am sure none -will blame the Pres-
ident for ft ehng some interest in the vindication
of his character^ against the foul imputation
stanip« d upon it foi an act which will m future
time be regarded as the most brilliant ev ent of his
eventful Administration This, sir, was his ob-
]cet, and 1ns only object; and he could not have
appealed w ith ns much propriety to any other
pi opio as to thatpeople,the people of Tennessee,
to whom he was so strongly attached, with whom
he had lived, and among whom he expected to
die. If the President has > lther openly or covertly
ttsi d his influence with the press for the purpose
of vilifying and abusing any man—if any mem-
ber of his Administration has done it—I have yet
to learn the fact; but it does not follow that,be-
cause presses arc employed by the Government
to do the public printing, the Government au-
thoii7cs or is responsible for everything that is
mseited in the columns of their papers. It is to
be expected that the Administration would feel
some interest in the vindication of its measures,
and against the antagonistic principles of the one,
and the misrepresentation of the other. But, sir,
I deny that the press has been purchased, for it
is a fact notorious that the majority of the Amer-
ican press is opposed to this Admmrstration. It
is reasonable and proper, then, that the Piesident
should prefi r presses sustaining it. I would ask
the honorable gentleman if he holds the candidate
vv horn he suppoi ts in the coming election respons-
ible fur all that is said in the presses that are
sustaining his election ' If he does, will he hold
him responsible for this article of the Richmond
Whig >
" JiuUe White elected, (if elected at all,) by the votes of
the Win j-, lie \v ill iidtui all v and neeessai lly select his comi-
se lora from their rank-, and modify his measures according
to their view-."
As also this article from the Charleston Mer-
cury :
' If Judire White should be elected, the Union party
would be dead and buried The nullificru would not only
have the a-e( ndeucy at home, but in the Federal Govern-
ment to boot "
Again it says:
" TIip\ (the Union party) weuld be dead pohtieillv both at
home and at VVa-hington, and not onlv tin-, but while their
part} and their principie  would be whisked to the wind ,
the principle- ot the ¡Mate Itiglits partv, under a man like
White, would «pread ami pío «per, anil berom'-substantially
the principle  of the Federal Administration "
Upon the principle that an Administration is
held responsible for all that rs said in the presses
supporting it, Judge White would be held re-
sponsible for the articles cited, avowing that his
administration would overthrow the Union party
and its principles.
Again: is the Judge to be held responsible for
all that has been said by the presses, sustaining
his pretensions to the prejudice of his opponent,
the Vice President? If so, I would invite a com-
panion between the presses sustaining each, and
it will be found that the abuse and vilification of
Judge White has been trifling, compared with
the volumes of slander and abuse pouied out
upon the head of the Vice Piesidi nt. Sn, this
state of things grows out of the fri'tdom of the
press. It cannot be controlled. I admit that the
piess has become greatly licentious —too little re-
spect to individual feeling and private reputation.
It is to be deplored, yet it cannot be avoided unless
it be shackled. To this I never could consent, for
I would much prefer enduiing its licentiousness
than shackle its fitedom. The freedom of the
press once shackled, and liberty is gone; then,
sir, what cannot be avoided must be endured; it
is the price we pay for liberty. There is but one
mode of correcting the evil, and that is, by the
patronage of the press, withholding their patron-
age from licentious presses. I do not intend to
discriminate. The presses on both sides are in
fault. I can only say, in relation to my humble
self, that when the press condescends to notice
me, I trust it will do it in tender mercy, for I
shall never have the folly to undertake a war
with it.
In relation to the present public printer, 1 can
only say that he was elected by Congress, and,
as has been truly said, by a party vote.    Ihose
