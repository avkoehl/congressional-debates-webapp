More the committee during the present ses-
sion, and state that they could v^th their pres-
i'i t facilities Iniild on an average 6,000 tons
each or o4,000 tons. Allowing three times the
amount of wooden tonnage, 162,000 tons, to be
built, and it would give us 2Hi,000 tons per
year. Allowing for a reasonable increase in
lite facilities for balding iron vessels and the
lotni amount of tonnage 1,520,601 tons could
j>rt>Uably be constructed in live years if required
by the Uemaad* at' hutiuuss, ,If built in that
lime, ill* cost to the Government would bo iu
rou ad numbers $5,000,000 per year; from which
would be deducted $1,000,000 surplus received
frnm tonnage tax, leaving but $4,01)0,000 per
year.
If we deduct from this amoant the $7,618,-
TS6 drawback on imported material for wooden
vessels, which we may properly do, as the ves-
sels canaot be built without the remission of
duties, so that there weald be no real loss of
revenue; and we have $12,485,946 to be paid
out in the five years, or $2,497,188, less $1,000,-
000 received from tonnage tax, leaving but
$1.497,186per annum to be actaallypaid from
the Treasury, and for it we should receive
twenty first-class iron steamers averaging
2.500 tons each, GO,000 tons iron and 195,000
tons wood sail vessels, Lu View of the testi-
mony cited caa aay appropriation for the Navy
be so well applied ad this small amount for the
merchant marine? Will it not add to the Navy
even more than the entire naval appropriation
when applied to the Navy proper? Wecaftuot
expect to carry all our exports and imports
in American vessels, but we can under the pro-
visions of this bill regain the percentage we
hBd before the war, and , compete on equal
terms for tbe general business of the world.
Bat it is objected that the paytoent of sub-
sidies is the establishment of a ntew principle
in legislation. Let us gee how this is. f here
has been granted to the WSsterri 8tateS atfd to
corporation#, for the development and im-
provement of internal commerce within tbese
States, nearly two hundred million acres
of the public domain, the common property
of the nation, and at the minimum price of
$1 25 per acre, a total in value of lands of
$250,000,000, apd in cash or bonds, $04,000,000,
making a grand total of $314,000,000, paid
directly from the common property and' the
common^treasure of the country for develop-
ing the internal commerce of the West and
Sooth. These subsidies have been distributed
among the following States:

JJas not the Government been bounteous in
its bounties and lavish in its liberality to the
interior commercial interests of the country?
I rejoice, sir, that it has been thus liberal in
its subsidies .to the internal commerce of the
great West, and I rejoice, too, that the votes
of the Atlantic sea-board States are to be
found recorded in almost one unbroken affirma-
tive for all these liberal grants. I rejoice that
mv own State, occupying the eastern extreme
of the country, although retarded in growth
.and prosperity by the drain of its popula-
tion to the western States, has, nevertheless,
whether represented by Whigs, by Democrats,
or by Republicans, voted for all theso liberal
measures. And I know full well that the only
reasou why the large-hearted and generous
West has not reciprocated this liberality of
the East is for want of opportunity and not
of disposition. .Mow, sir,.can it be contended
by any one that bounties paid to railroads
located in certain States, the direct benefit of
which inures to corporations and the indirect
advantages of which qre largely local, arc more
legitimate, more national in their olyects,than
those paid for building up the foreign com-
merce of the country? If these railroads ex-
tended to all parts of the country and were free
to all, as the ocean extends to all parts of the
world and is free to all, then the Government
aid to interior railways would in its nationality
more nearly approximate to that granted to
external or ocean commerce.
, Sir, ou a great national question like that
under consideration, a question rising far above
auy-mere local,considerations, rising I might
almpst, say even above national considerations,
and embracing within its scope the interests
of mankind, I should feel that I degraded the
subject were I to appeal to any narrow sec
tional prejudices or interests for support. What
is for the interest of any one section of the
country is for the interest of the whole coun-
try,'and what is for the interest of the whole
country is for the interest of the world, be-
cause all the privileges, all the advantages, all
th# blessings which we enjoy are open and free
to all who will come and partake of them. But
I cannot forbear calling attention to the prob-
abilities that the South and the West are to be
rtiorts directly benefited by the reconstructed
American merchant marine, which is to per-
form its part in the new commercial era which
•is now dawning opon the world, than either
tbe North or the East.
Let us glance briefly at some of the great
facts connected .with the commercial revolu-
tion qow going on in the world, The opening
of the Suez canal, the construction of which
was so long resisted by the sagacious states-
men of England, and so wisely aided by the
sagacious statesman who presides over the
destinies of France, h^s been opened to com-
merce and has become an assured success.
The trade of the Indies, which formerly flowed
through the Mediterranean, studding it with
populous and wealthy cities and making it the
empire of commerce, and which was diverted
by the discovery of the passage round the Cape
of Good Hope, has returned, and now flows
with increased and increasing volume through
its ancient channel. This change of the great
current of trade from the East to the West lias
left Great Britain off its line and is destined to
work as great a revolution in the ocean com-
; rperce of the world as did the discovery of the
S passage via the Cape of Good Hope. It will
I turn the currents of trade of southern Europe
! which now run toward the English channel
j to the Mediterranean ports, whence it will flow
east to thelndies and westto the United States.
I : Great Britaiu bas become the -warehouse of
the world by drawing to herself the products
of all coi^utries, and either in their crude or in
an elaborated form redistributing them. But
she cannot lung divert trade fifteen degrees of
latitude north uut of its natural course. The
trade of one hundred and eighty million people
in Europe will now naturally seek an outlet
through the Mediterranean. The ocean routes
to the north ot Europe are oocupied. It would
be unwise to try to wrest them from those in
possession while more favorable and unoccu-
pied routes invite our attention. We are on
the direct line of the world's great current of
trade from east to west. A vessel passing from
the Mediterranean to the Atlant ic has scarcely
to change her course a point to strike New York.
Between the thirtieth and forty-second paral lei
of north latitude are embraced the ports of St.
Augustine, Savannah, Charleston, Beaufort,
Wilmington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York, and on the opposite side of the Atlantic
the entrance to the Mediterranean, now the
great highway of the commerce of the world,
while the passage to the Continent by this route
is in the pleasant latitudes, taking in the Azores
,on the voyage.
C di4 is as near as Liverpool to New York.
It i$ our policy to strike for this direct trade
with the continent of Europe and with India,
divert it from Great Britain and bring it to our-
selves' We thus tap the trade of Spain, of
France, of Italy, of Austria, pf southern Ger-
many, of Turkey, and of sapthern, Russia as
well as that of all the ports of northern Africa,
from Morocco to Suez ; and all this trade comes
to us south of the forty-second parallel of north
latitude. The whole travel to and from the
United States as far east as New York, and to
and from the continent of Europe and much
of that to and from Great Britain, would soon
follow this route in preference to encountering
the dangers and discomforts of the more north-
ern passage. The present lines of foreign
steamers will undoubtedly continue to carry
the trade apd travel between northern Europe
and the extreme east of our own country, to-
gether with all that vast and increasing trade
between those countries and the present British
North A.merican proviuces, which are soon to
become a great, and independent nation-
Let us now turn our attention to other of
the great unoccupied routes of ocean com-
merce, those which in the fixture are to be the
most important of all—the routes between our
Pacifia coast and the nations of the East.
When we consider that these easteru nations,
swarming with population, possessing the accu-
mulated wealth of ages, presenting afield for
commercial enterprise which all -maritime na-
tions have for centuries striven to possess, lie
directly in froqt of our western coast, with only
the broad Pacific between; that ou this side
are the fertile unoccupied lands ready to re-
ceive this overflowing population, what mind
can conceive, what imagination even exagger-
ate the possibilities of our future? if we,have
the wisdom to appropriate and improve the
advantages whichnature has so profusely placed
in our pathway. A glance at.a,comparative
table of distances between London ati4 the
ports of China and Japan, and San Francisco
and the same ports, is sufficient to show the
advantages which we possess as against the
world in competing for this trade of the East;

But there are other advantages besides that

the American Pacific coast and the nations of
the East., This commerce is direct and natural,
untaxed, unobstructed, and unobstructible;
equally adapted to the use pf pail or ot steam
