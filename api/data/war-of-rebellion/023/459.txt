Gov. J. F. ROBINSON, Frankfort, Ky.:

The intelligence I have is not on the whole unfavorable, and hope therefore the news you have received is exaggerated. I have done everything possible to hasten forward troops. Two regiments have gone on to-night.

If Nelson is in the condition you think him he would certainly have notified me. Have had several telegrams from Lexington to-night, none of which refer at all to any such state of things. Large re-enforcements have been sent from Lexington.

Major-General, Commanding.

Gov. OLIVER P. MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind.:

When and how fast can regiments and batteries be forwarded from your State? Let them all go to Louisville as fast as transportation to that point is available. Buell seems to be in a tight place, and a force for his relief must be collected the soonest possible. The troops must do the they can without tents till supply can be obtained.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same to Gov. Richard Yates, Illinois.)
