Colonel A. S. DOBBIN,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: Your communication of the 4th instant is to hand, and in reply General Shelby directs me to say that the stock spoken of is very much needed in mounting the troops in this sub-district. The object ins ending his brigade here was to injure the enemy in every way possible, and it is evidently very much to our interest to break up these farms. Should you agree with the general in the practicability of sending an expedition in that direction for the purpose of destroying the farms and driving off the stock and negroes employed on them, he will at any time you may deem it most expedient send you an additional force of 250 men (Gordon's regiment) to assist you in accomplishing the object desired. If the negroes could be put to no other use they could be distributed among the citizens, and thus be made to render them great assistance in subsisting the army.

Very respectfully,

W. J. McARTHUR,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HOUSTON, July 7, 1864.

Brigadier General J. M. HAWES, Galveston:

Push forward works on beach, and fire into any blockader that comes within range and keep them at respectful distance.
