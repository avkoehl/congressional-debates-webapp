It is reported that Price has been badly beaten near Independence; Marmaduke and Cabell and 1,500 prisoners captured. Price is no doubt moving rapidly south on the Kansas border, and may pass near Neosho. Hold your command in readiness to move at a moment's notice, and if you receive reliable information that he is moving on Neosho, fall back with your command to Mount Vernon. Give instruction to commanding officer at Newtonia.
