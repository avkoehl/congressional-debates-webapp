Gov. JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville, Ga.:

Chattanooga is threatened by so superior a force that its evacuation seems almost inevitable. General Leadbetter is ordered, if he cannot hold the place, to retreat in this direction.

Colonel BENJAMIN ALLSTON,

Commanding First Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: The enemy are making demonstrations in force upon Chattanooga. Columns, with artillery, are moving up from Winchester and Jasper. It is probable that they may contemplate a concentrated movement upon East Tennessee and may make an inroad by cavalry force through Kingston. The major-general commanding therefore directs that you will send to that place such disposable force as you may be able to spare from Powell's Valley, after making proper provision for watching the approaches over the mountains. You will communicate these facts to the commanding officer at Kingston, with instructions to send out scouts in the direction of Winchester as well as toward Montgomery, and give timely notice of any movement of the enemy in either quarter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General R. E. LEE, Richmond, Va.:

General Leadbetter telegraphs that is certain the enemy are advancing in force upon Chattanooga by way of Winchester and a column moving up from Jasper with eight pieces of artillery. Twelve regiments with artillery came through Winchester on Wednesday. Also that troops from Corinth supply the places of those on the march. I have directed him to remove all the stores, as I fear that before the brigade ordered from Powell's Valley reaches Chattanooga that place will fall.
