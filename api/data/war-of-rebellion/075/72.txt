infantry about Dalton, unless re-enforced since last night. Of these there are 11,000 men posted in Buzzard Gap, comprising Steward's and Breckinridge's old divisions, commanded, I think, by Bate. Hindman's and Stevenson's divisions, numbering about 10,000, are stationed about five miles and a half north of Dalton, lying between the East Tennessee railroad and the mountain. Cleburne's division, about 6,000 strong, is on Hindman's right, between him and the railroad. The position of the three latter divisions is strongly intrenched.

There is a good deal of artillery, none of it heavier than 10-pounder caliber. The horses are not in good condition, and wound not stand a long march. The rebels were working all last night fortifying Buzzard Roost Gap, and have masked batteries at points all along through it. The low ground has been all overflowed by dams, so that you can't travel the road, except close up to the hill. The dams are covered over with brush to conceal them. Forrest was reported last night to be within ten hours' ridge of Resaca. Johnson is reported to have said that he wished the Federals would go to his (rebel) left; that he would rather have them attempt a flank there than on his right. The army is full of confidence in Johnson and of whipping the United States forces, and intend to make a desperate struggle.

Taken before me this 8th day of May, 1864.
