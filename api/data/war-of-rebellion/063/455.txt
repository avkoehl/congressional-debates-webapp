Bayou Rapides road 7 miles from Alexandria, and probably 12 miles from General Smith. Does not the Fort Jesup road traverse this gap? At all events, ought not a cavalry force to be thrown forward to watch between Smith's command and my detachment?

Very respectfully,

Major-General, Commanding.

ALEXANDRIA, LA., May 5, 1864-3.10 p.m.

Brigadier-General DWIGHT,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your dispatch is this moment received. Captain Garber left the advance at 2 o'clock, only 1 1/2 miles from Graham's, its destination. Doubtless, therefore, the detachment has fully performed the duty upon which they were sent. I will dispatch a courier with all possible haste, directing the officer in immediate command carefully, but expeditiously, to return and bring with him all available forage.

Very respectfully,

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-A courier this moment arrives, bringing a report from General Lawler that he drove the enemy step by step from his position of this morning to and beyond Graham's plantation; our forces now rest at that place. The enemy left his killed and wounded behind, who, together with a few prisoners, have fallen into our hands.

Brigadier General M. K. LAWLER,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Herewith you will find a communication from department headquarters. Upon its receipt you and the command with you will return to your positions of this morning, moving expeditiously, observing every precaution against surprise, and bringing with you all the forage you can. Learning from Major Marsh, about 12 o'clock to-day, that there was a gap several miles between you and Smith, I ventured to suggest to the general commanding the importance of throwing forward a body of cavalry to make observations on your left. The cavalry, however, being much dispersed and worn, may not reach left or any point between you and Smith for an indefinite time to come.

Very respectfully,

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, May 5, 1864.

Major-General McCLERNAND,

Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that you move General Lawler at daylight in the morning to cover forage in your front.
