CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
This is what was said by these eminent free-trade
authorities on these recent occasions; and I shall not
pretend to comment upon their admissions. They
are explicit upon the grounds of discrimination and
incidental protection. They quote, and admit by
name, the system of our tariff legislation before the
late war—that system under which the country wa 
so long tranquil and happy, and to which I am now
for returning. -They admit, by name, discrimina-
tion for protection. The compromise act did the
same in effect. The raising the duties on coarse
woollens and common blankets, by that act, from
5 per cent to 50, to come down in nine years to
20,. was for protection during that time. Home
valuations and cash duties were to aid manufac-
turers. A long list of free articles, used by manu-
facturers, was for the same object. Protection was
granted by the act; and the declaration against it,
and in favor of revenue duties only, was a direction
for future legislation, and did not prevent the com-
promise itself from granting protection.
I am for returning to the old legislation, not that
I would copy any one statute in particular, but
would conform to the plan and object of the whole.
These statutes admitted of duties of various degrees,
but all of them moderate in amount, and strictly
calculated for revenue purposes. They admitted of
duties on the quantity (specific) as well as on the
value (ad valorem;) and when on the value
they admitted of no minimums to falsify the
real value and to augment the duty. They
admitted of discriminations between articles of
luxury and articles of necessity, and very prop-
erly made the former pay highest, while many of
the latter were free—as salt in the time of Mr. Jeffer-
son, or at the low rate of five per centum—as coarse
woollens and common blankets, and other articles
used by the laboring community. The specific
duties, under these statutes, rarely exceeded a
fourth or a third of the value: the advalorems ranged
from five to fifteen, with a temporary addition of
two and a half per centum to equip some small
vessels to protect the Mediterranean commerce from
the depredations of the Barbary powers. To this
system of duties, and this mode of levying theni, I
am in favor of returning, with the single qualification
that, in no case, shall any duty, either specific or
ad valorem, exceed one third of the ialue—33 J per
centum; and with the full belief that the average of
the whole will not be equal to the uniform twenty
per centum of the compromise act. To the con-
sumer, this maximum, and this average, should be
satisfactory: to the manufactures, it will be great and
ample protection. To him, it should be also satis-
factory. He will get the benefit of the highest du ty;
for it comes within the principle of the old system,
to put the highest duties upon the foreign rivals
of our own productions, as well as upon luxu-
ries: he will get the benefit of this duty, which
will give him 50 per centum protection. 1 say 50;
for 30 per centum duty is 50 per centum protection!
the expenses of importation (7', per cent) and (he
importing merchant's profit ("121 per cent.) going
into the price ol the goods us well as the duty, and
being iust as effectual for protection as if inserted in
the law. Tins, with the cardinal consideration of
stability, should be satisfactory to the manufactur-
ers.
.This is our issue—the old system a«ainst the
new; and upon this issue we can safely go to trial
before the country. For it is not sufficient to ha\e a
good cause, and good arguments: you must have
the right issues, or you may be defeated in spite of
your good cause and good arguments. The com-
promise is not the right issue or the safe one. In
levelling all duties to one uniform line—m disre-
garding the distinction between luxuries and neces-
saries, and between articles made or not made at
home, in doing this, it disregards a distinction
founded in the nature of things—a distinction main-
tained in all previous legislation—admitted most re-
cently by the extremest free-trade authorities—and
too accordant with the sympathies of mankind to
be obliterated by statute. We cannot make the
issue upon that act, but upon the old system of rev-
enue duties and incidental protection, with discrimi-
nation between luxuries and necessaries, and be-
tween articles made or not made at home. W< are
not to make war upon manufactures: we do not do
!!' -vr t Were on(,'° as P°Pulm" in the South as in
the ^orth, and may become so again. The abuses
ot the high protective system have destroyed their
lA°P.-n'7 m 'J16 ®outh: "radicate the abuse,
ana tney will again be popular in every part of the
Union. Manufactures are among, not only the use-
ful and ornamental, but the noblest arts of the
country. Every statesman will cherish them, and
honor the skill and industry which perfects them, if
left free to follow his own inclinations. Abuse
only—the conduct of politicians and millionary
capitalists—have made them enemies. Separate the
real manufacturers from these two classe.s—be con-
tent with ample incidental protection—and universal
good will will again attend them, greatly enlarging
the extent of their market, and the list of their cus-
tomers.
This is our issue—the old system against the
new. And what can be the objection to returning to
the old one? None that cannot be instantly and sat-
isfactorily answered. I undertake to say that, un-
der the old system, every interest connect-
ed with the imposition of duties was on a
better footing than under the new—that ag-
riculture, commerce, and the revenue from cus-
toms, were all larger in proportion to our pop-
ulation, and more free from fluctuations—that man-
ufactures themselves were advancing faster than any
other interest, and faster than they had ever advanced
in any other country in the world; and that the
whole country, so far as the tariff was concerned,
was happy and tranquil; and continued so until am-
bitious politicians and millionary capitalists seized
upon the subject for their own selfish purposes.
These, Mr. President, are bold assertions, but not
more bold than true, and as easily proved as uttered,
I have the proof in hand; and as I love to deal in
proof when I have it, I shall proceed immediately to
the work.
1. The revenue from customs.
My assertion is, that the income from customs
was larger, population considered, and more free
from fluctuation, under the low duty system before
the war, than under the high duty since. In main-
taming this assertion, I take the time of the first pe-
riod from 1789, when this government first went
into operation, to the year 1808, when the British
orders in council, and the decrees of the French em-
peror, and our own embargo, broke up our com-
merce, and deranged or destroyed our income from
that source. 1 leave out the period of the embargo
and of the war with threat Britain, as belonging to
neither system. 1 take from 1790 to 1808: and what
was our income from customs during that time? It
was from four and a half to near sixteen millions
and a half of dollars. And what was our population
during the same time' From four millions to seven
millions. The revenue then commenced at the rate
ot about one million of dollars to one million of
people, and rose gradually to near two and a half
millions of dollars to one million of people. So
much for the first period; now for the second. Be-
ginning with the year 1817, which was the first un-
der the operation of the new system, and the revenue,
commencing at twenty-six millions of dollars, fell as
low as ten, rose again as high as thirty, fell again as
low as twelve, thirteen, and fourteen millions, and
for the last year was about seventeen and a half.
Our population at the same time was from nine to
eighteen millions; so (hat, at the best, the product of
the high duties never rose higher than two and a
half millions of dollars to one million of people,
often fell as low us three quarters of a million of
dollars for a million of people, and is now at the
rate of a million for a million! In other words, that
(he rate ot product is exactly the same now, when
duties average more than 50 per cent, that it was in
the first year nf Washington's time, when the aver-
age was the one-fourdi of that sum' and twice and a
half less than it was m the last year of Mr. Jeffer-
son, when the average of duties was not a third of
what it is now. And here let it be remembered that
the wars of the French revolution had nothing to do
with our revenue. They increased importations,
but not consumption. Duties were only paid on
what remained in the country for consumption; the
large amounts le-exported paid nothing.
1 have prepared tables, Mr. Resident, of the an-
nual income from customs, with a note of the pop-
ulation, during each period into which I have divided
our financial history. These tables will illustrate
my positions in detail, and more fully and com-
pletely than can be done in general statements.
1 hey will enable every senator, and every individ-
ual who sees them, to make the comparison for him-
self, and will sustain to the uttermost all that I have
said of the superior productiveness of low duties
over high. These are the tables:

These, Mr. President, are the tables of the in-
come under the two systems; and now let us ex-
amine them, and compare them together. Look
first upon this picture, and then upon that! See the
annual income from 1791 to 1808: see the large-
ness of the amount for the smallncs of the
population, the freedom from fluctuation, and
the steadiness of the increase. Beginning at four
and one third millions, rising gradually, never vary-
ing more than a million in a year, and attaining in
seventeen years the extraordinary amount of near
seventeen millions of dollais, and that for only
seven millions of people. Now look upon the other
picture. Beginning in the year 1817,'with twenty-
six and a quarter millions of dollars, it falls the very
next year to seventeen millions ' and the year after
rises to twenty and a quarter millions' tumbles
down the next year to fifteen millions: and the
year after tumbles again to thirteen millions:
being ail actual fluctuation of thiiteeii millions
out of twenty-six m five _ years! All the rest
ot the period is about in the same propor-
tion. Twice in twenty years the income got up as
high as it was in 1817: twicc again it feli to 17 —
twice to 15—twice to 13—once to 10—and is now
at l1^, which is near ten millions less than it v. a:-
ill the year 1808! This is bad enough: but to show
off this period in proper contrast, a third table is
necsssary—a table showing at one view the actual
income received, and the amount that ought to have
been received during- the same period, accoidiiig to
the increase of population, and according to the rate
of the income during Mr. Jefferson's administration.
This third table has been prepared, and here it is:
Ihird table, shoivhig what ought to have been received
from customs under the protective system to have been
equal to the receipt under the revenue system.
