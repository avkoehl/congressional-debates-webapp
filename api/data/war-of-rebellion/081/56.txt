HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 15, 1864-3.50 a.m.

General WILLIAMS:

The upper wharf on the other side is not finished, but is being completed as rapidly as possible. I am now commencing to put over my wagons, &amp;c. If more infantry is to follow without interfering with my command, it might commence coming slowly, but it would interfere in a great measure with my facilities for getting over my artillery and wagons. All my infantry, including the pickets, are across except one regiment of heavy artillery, with the four batteries of artillery, which are across, which will be complete as soon as four caissons and a few horses are sent over. No report of the rations yet. It will take some time to issue them on account of the absence of wagons, tow of the divisions being some two miles from the landing, the other being massed near by.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 15, 1864-6.30 a.m.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
