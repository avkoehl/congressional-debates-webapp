GENERAL: The enemy in advancing on General Wood at Gordon's Mills with cavalry and infantry. He opened on the rebel column a few minutes ago with artillery and they fell back. Colonel Minty's pickets have been driven in, and he is now skirmishing heavily with what appears to be both cavalry and infantry. He is at Reed's Mill, between Gordon's Mills and Ringgold. It is probable that the enemy is attempting to turn our left. The general commanding directs you to hold your command in readiness to come over to Crittenden's support, if it shall be necessary. In that case McCook will close up and occupy your newly assigned position.

Major-General McCOOK;

GENERAL: The enemy is making a heavy demonstration on our left. It in not yet clear whether he means to strike us here, or is merely making a feint preparatory to striking a blow elsewhere. The general commanding thinks it prudent in you to stop Lytle in him march at the top or foot of Stevens' Gap, or in case he has passed too far to be returned with ease, that you see in some other way to the support of the cavalry which is guarding that pass until the plans of the enemy are more fully developed. He must not get the mountain road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
