APPENDIX TO THE CONGEESSIONAL GLOBE.

Ho. of Eeps.
Revenue Iieform—Mr. Asper,
41st Cong....3d Sess.
quence of the elasticity, as it is called, of the
revenue, from the growth, expansion, and de-
velopment of the country, you will raise from
excise duties on those articles alone, that is
from spirits, tobacco, and stamps, without bur-
dening a single individual in the country, with-
out injuring trade and commerce, or oppress-
ing the farmer or the laborer; you will raise
from those articles alone $150,000,000. Then
may we not reduce our impost revenue to a
few revenue bearing articles, these few articles
from which we derive one hundred million
dollars or thereabout, or perhaps one hundred
and twenty-five million dollars? May we not,
from the growth and expansion of the country
and the increase of its ability to consume and
the increase of trade from the growing pros-
perity of the country, may we not, reduce our
tariff to twenty or thirty articles, and from
those articles raise the revenue, a sufficient
revenue to carry on the Government and dis-
charge every obligation which rests upon us?
Would not relief be felt all over llie land by
the tax-ridden people; a people who, with a
patience unparalleled, has been paying taxes
as bounties to manufacturers?
May we not do it? I ask that question
seriously and in earnest. Why should we
continue these burdens under these circum-
stances ? But I may be met by some dema-
gogue, away off in the country, who desires to
work upon the feelings of his constituents,
with the question, "Would you tax the tea
and coffee, the poor man's drink?" Why,
sir, 1 would say to such a man, "Do you
understand what you are talking about?"
Let me inquire here why it is that the poor
man should not pay his portion ot the tax to
sustain the Government? Has he no honor
in the matter? Has he no patriotism in the
matter ? Is not the protection of the Govern-
ment to his person and his liberties as dear
to the poor man as to the wealthiest citizen
of the land, and ought he not to pay his por-
tion of the expenses of that Government?
All, sir, when the country was in danger,
when the flag was insulted and trailed in the
dust, then the poor man, knowing what his
responsibilities to the Government were, what
his duty in reference to its flag, stepped for-
ward in a patriotic manner and undertook, as
far as was in-liis power, to relieve the country
and to avenge the honor of the flag. Did lie
not do it? And is he not to be considered as
patriotic to-day as when, in 1861, lje stepped
forward and bared his breast to the storm,
and stood in defense of his country ? I take
it that it is an impeachment upon the patriot-
ism of every man throughout the whole coun-
try, laborer though he may be, to say that
because he is a poor man he should not have
his tea and coffee taxed.
Why, sir, those are articles which enter into
general consumption ; they are articles which
you can refuse or you can purchase. There
is no compulsion on any man to use them. The
poor man can buy them if he pleases, just as
he buys his glass of grog or his pipe of tobacco.
There is no compulsion in the matter. But if
he desires to use these articles, if it is a com-
fort and for the comfort of his family to use
them, he will readily purchase them. But let
us see what the amount of the burden is that
rests upon the poor man in consequence of the
taxes upon tea, coffee, sugar, and molasses. I
have here a table, prepared by Mr. Youngwith
a great deal of care, which shows exactly the
amount of the burden which rests upon the
poor man. Let' me say, in the first instance,
that the average amount of revenue received
from tea. coffee, sugar, and molasses, during
the lastfouryears, is $56,148,847. Now, what
has been the burden of that? .We find that
the amount of these articles used by each indi-
vidual has been, per week, of tea, ]x3w
pound« to the inhabitant; of coffee, 5^
the inhabitant; and of molasses, thirty-one
cents' worth to the inhabitant.
The amount of tax per capita, per year,
has been twenty-six cents on tea, 27cents
on coffee, eighty-five cents on sugar, and
twelve cents on molasses, making $1 50 a year
to each inhabitant. I want to know if that is
a heavy burden upon the people. I want to
know if that is a tax which we ought to get
rid of. I want to know if the patriotic citizen
of the country, however poor he may be, the
man who works for $1 50 per day, is not will-
ing to bear his portion of the burdens which
rests upon him to discharge the honorable
obligation of the G-overnment. Now, let us
take the amount of duties paid by a family of
persons per week. It amounts to but 17i$j-
cents for all these articles of tea, coffee, sugar,
and molasses, for a family of six persons, per
week. Now, aggregate that by the number
of weeks, and you can readily ascertain how
much tax every man who is the head of a fam-
ily of six persons would have to pay. It would
be in the neighborhood of nine or ten dollars
a year. Here are two tables which show the
average raised per capita from tea, coffee,
sugar, and molasses, with the averasre yearly
consumption of these articles, one in 1867:

Now, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, I ask every
intelligent citizen of this country, I ask every
honest, patriotic farmer and laborer in the
land, if that is a tax which he regards as bur-
densome upon him? It is a tax which rests
upon every individual in the land. Of course
the wealthy man requires more for the con-
sumption of his family than does the poor
man; the consumption in his family will go
above the average, while that of the poor man's
family will go below the average.
Now, here are the facts and the figures. In
order to raise $5(5,000,000 a year, for the last
four years it has cost each head of a family of
six persons about 18f cents per week. Now,
it seems to me that the argument of the dem-
agogue, in referring to the tax on these arti-
cles, will be at once met by the reply of every
intelligent man, by the man who can reason
for himself, "Sir, I would rather have that
burden upon my family for a year than be
compelled to pay from twenty to twenty five
dollars a year tax upon the boots and shoes
which I supply to my wife, my children, and
myself; or the fifty or sixty dollars per year
upon the clothing which I am compelled to
buy in order to decently clothe my wife, my
children, and myself." For you must remem-
ber that in the adjustment of duties the coarser
