and the pieces required for existing organizations, I directed the men to be returned to their regiments and the pieces turned in to the ordnance officer, who will issue them to batteries requiring guns. As soon as General Benham's lines are completed, and the batteries of this army filled, I will send such batteries to arm the lines as may be necessary. This explanation is now made in case this subject is brought to your attention.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,City Point, Va., October 20, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Your report of the 30th of September gives aggregate present for duty at 55,012; that of October 10, at 54,525; loss in ten days, from September 30 to October 10,487. During these ten days the provost-marshal-general sent forward recruits amounting to 5,594. Adding these accessions to the loss above reported would make a loss diminution. Does sickness prevail to a large extent, or are many old regiments going out? Any information you can furnish on this subject will much oblige,

Very truly, your friend,

I have just returned to camp and received the glorious new from Sheridan.* To achieve such results after having met the reverse he describes, is one of the most brilliant feats of the war. I heartily congratulate you and him on the result.

GENERAL: The following communication received this a. m. from Captain McEntee, in charge of the Information Department at City Point:

Messenger from Richmond states: "All roads leading into the city are protected by torpedoes. The iron-clad railroad battery was placed near the outer fortifications on the York River railroad last Sunday. None of Early's men have returned to Richmond, excepting those who lave lost their arms. Pickett's division and Thomas' brigade are between the Appomattox and James."

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
