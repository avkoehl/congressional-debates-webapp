Currency—Mr. Burcliard.
Ho. op Reps.
While this is a per capita increase of $8 75
on the total circulation, and $2 75 on that in
actual use, above that of 1860, in my judgment
it does not exceed the needs of the country.
The depreciation of the currency, it seems to
trie, results from its inconvertibility, not from
its excess. The cash in the national banks
amounted in 1868 to $181,000,000, in 1870 to
$149,000,000, a difference of $32,000,000 with-
drawn, within two years, from the reserve, and
added to the active circulation through the
demands of business. No legislation should
reduce the total volume, however advantage-
ous it may be to change the relative proportions
of the different kinds of currency to resume
specie payments at once. We only lack a suffi-
cient stock of coin to insure its permanency.
deposits not circulation.
I havenot considered deposits as circulation,
as some able writers upon finance do. A de-
posit of money in a bank is evidently not cir-
culation so long as it remains idle in the bank.
A credit on deposit account without deposit
of cash does not become circulation. By inter-
change of such credits exchanges can be facil-
itated in the same manner as by the use of
currency. The transfer of deposit credits by
means of checks when the money is not drawn,
but the amount is credited to the holder of the
check or further exchanges are made by means
of the check, dispenses with the use of a like
amount of money and serves as a substitute
for circulation and so diminishes the amount
required. Deposit account shows the balance
due depositors, not the amount and frequency
of deposit transfers. It is a reservoir into
which inactive circulating capital is received;
and out of which, as loans, a portion has flowed,
but such movement in and out serves to ease
and aid the loan market, but not to lighten the
demand for circulation. It is the transfer of
the credit without diminution of deposits that
becomes a substitute for currency.
Notwithstanding this amount of currency,
reports come to us of its insufficiency to trans-
act necessary business. In some localities col-
lections have been almost suspended, trade par-
alyzed, and business unremunerative. "While
this has been occasioned, doubtless in a great
measure from scarcity of loanable capital, since
at the same time a plethora of money is com-
plained of at the business centers, if legisla-
tion, without impairing the currency, can afford
even partial relief it should be accorded.
remedies frojposed.
Is any measure of local advantage possible
■without affecting the character or injuriously
expanding or contracting the volume of the
currency'! Are the privileges and benefits de-
rived from the present monetary system enjoyed
alike by all parts of the country? Does it im-
pose unnecessary burdens upon the people,
and can any change be made advantageous for
theirmterests? These questions have received
the patient and careful consideration of the
Committee on Bankingand Currency. The Sen-
ate, after discussion and deliberation, passed
their judgment as to the measure of relief neces-
sary andexpedient. Upon their billit seemed
preferable to ingraft only such modifications as
would further attain the desired object and not
imperil its passage. Confessedly the payment
of interest by the Government upon reserve
circulation is unwise and wasteful. None but
the banks holding them will object to the retire-
ment and cancellation of the $45,000,000 of
three per cent, certificates held as reserves by
the banks, if the volume of circulation is
unchanged.
itnfqual apportionment of bank circulation,
But the most glaring defect and injustice in
our present monetary system is the unequal
allotment and distribution of bank circulation.
States containing less than one third of the
population, densely settled and compact in ter-
nlory, using more largely checks and credit
accounts, and thus requiring less currency,
have been permitted to appropriate more than
three fourths of the bank circulation authorized
to be issued. This they insist upon retaining,
not for the needs of their business, but for the
greater profits from its enjoyment. If exist-
ing legislation has permitted or sanctioned the
inequality its continuance cannot be justified if
its correction without hardship is possible.
In the present apportionment of banking
currency twenty-six States and Territories lack
of their just proportion the following amounts,
which have been appropriated by the other
States:

To correct this inequality the committee
propose to increase the amount of $45,000,000
authorized to be issued by the Senate bill to
$95,000,000. Every State can thus secure the
amount to which it was entitled under the law
as originally enacted. Instead of $20,000,000,
$25,000,000 is proposed to be withdrawn from
banks in States having an excess of their share
of circulation, and to be redistributed to States
having less, giving in all to the latter States an
addition of $120,000,000 to their bank circu-
lation and a corresponding increase in the
facilities afforded thereby. Provisions are
retained for the convenience of the Pacific
States for organizing banks on a coin basis.
The $45,000,000 of three per cent, certificates
are to be retired and the amount of legal-
tender notes sufficient to prevent inflation or
contraction under the operation of the bill, if it
becomes a law. A majority of the committee
considered that the cancellation of $40,000,000
of legal-tender notes would secure that result.
As the issue of $95,000,000 of bank circulation
will require a cash reserve of fifteen per cent,
in the country and twenty-five per cent, in the
redeeming centers, a reserve must be deducted
varying from fourteen to nineteen million dol-
lars, so that while the total volume of cir-
culation would be increased $10,000,000 the
amount in actual circulation would be lessened
from four to nine million dollars, or double
that amount if increased bank deposits equal
the increased circulation.
coix reserve.
To obviate this contraction, I have moved
an amendment requiring the national banks
hereafter to retain in coin or coin certificates,
as part of their reserve, the interest received
on the bonds deposited as security for their
circulation until the amount equals the reserve
to be kept at their place of business. This
would semi-annually strengthen the banks with
about ten million dollars of coin now out of
circulation, and put in circulation ahkeamount
of currency now held as part of the reserve. It
would expand as much as the other provisions
of the bill would diminish the active circula-
tion, and be a step, slow but sure, in the direc-
tion of safe and final resumption of specie
payment, to secure which the banks should aid
the Government. The only opposition I can
conceive will be from the friends of those
banks that prefer the present status and the
greater profit from thei sale of the Coin interest
at the present premium. Prudence and safety
demand, regardless of lessened profits, riot only
a reserve, but such reserve as will ultimately be
most serviceable and advantageous to the pub-
lic, and the bank itself. If the bill as reported
should be sustained I hope ray amendment
will be adopted. '
If the amendment moved by my colleague
[Mr. Judd] striking out the provisions for
retiring legal tenders prevails, it is conjectural
what, if any, expansion would result under the
bill. While the increase authorized would be
$50,000,000 the legal reserves for deposits and
circulation would tie up in the banks an amount
variously estimated at from fourteen to thirty-
eight million dollars, depending upon whether
the new banks were organized in localities re-
quiring fifteen or twenty-five per cent, reserve,
and whether the increase of deposits equaled
the' bank circulation issued. The volume of
currency in use would be enlarged by this cal-
culation from $30,000,000 to $12,000,000. But
the history of the currency arid a glance at the
tables I submit will show that from the year
1834 to the present time the cash in the banks
has never been less than fifty percent, of their
circulation, except in 1847 and 1848, and the
period of inflation that culminated in 1857 at
the lowest point then exceeding forty per cent.
The bank returns of January last show in bank
$149,000,000 of currency, aside from specie,
to $295,000,000 circulation. The issue of this
increased circulation will be to new organiza-
tions whose cash in bank will fully equal or
exceed the average in the past; so that there
is a strong probability that one half of the
amount of the new circulation would be held
in reserve, and theactual expansion notexceed
$0,000,000.
While steadiness in the volume of currency
is desirable, a few millions contraction or ex-
pansion is not material and would scarcely
be known or felt. The amount of paper cur-
rency in the banks varies from time to time.
In October last there were $142,000,000; iu
January following, $149,000,000 ; contraction
$5,000,000, and no one the wiser. May ], 1870,
the Treasury held $7,000,000 legal tenders;
June 1, following, $14,000,000; contraction
$7,000,000, without appreciable change in the
money market or quantity of money in use.
Scarcely any two years has the volume or per
capita quantity of the currency in use remained
the same. Seldom has there been less than
$10,000,000 annual variation in the volume;
frequently thirty or forty millions without dis-
turbance. , _
"Contraction" and "inflation are hob-
goblins, the fear of which seems to distract
from the consideration of measures of practical
legislation.
The committee have recommended one pro-
vision that will defeat the object of the bill.
The new banks are required to purchase at par
in coin bonds only drawing four and a half per
cent, interest. Coin is worth at this time about
