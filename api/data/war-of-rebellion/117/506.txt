taken prisoners of war on the battle-field near Groveton, Va., August 30, 1862, and at Countervail, VA., September 2, 1862, who have been paroled by the Confederate authorities. Package A contains the names of our wounded and attendants paroled on the battle-field from September 1 to September 7 inclusive. Package B contains the names of wounded and attendants paroled at Centervill, Va., September 3, 4 and 5. Package C contains the names of our soldiers, not wounded, paroled at Countervail, Va., September 3, 4 and 6. I think it proper to state that the lists in package A, from A to L inclusive, were under the superintendence of Medical Director McParlin, U. S. Army. Those from M to Q inclusive were named after I had relieved that officer on the battle-field and were verified by me by comparison with the originals attested by medical officers detailed for that purpose. The packages marked B and C were prepared at Countervail under the direction of Medical Inspector E. P. Vollum, U. S. Army, and are presented as given to me by that officer. Each soldier paroled at Countervail had a special parole given him, which was not the case with those paroled on the battle-field.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD H. COOLIDGE,

Medical Inspector, U. S. Army.
