money, which they hold without any special orders and seek instructions as to its disposition. At several of these camps I found large numbers of Union soldiers under sentence of courts-martial. Although not within the preview of this report, I cannot help from suggesting that they are many fine soldiers who have already been punished sufficiently and who could render good service if sent back to their commands. At Camp Chase, Columbus, Ohio, I found some 200 or 300 paroled Federal soldiers, without commander, discipline, or any kind of order. At the Columbus, Ohio, penitentiary, I found General John Morgan and seventy-eight of his officers. They were not shaved and dressed in convict clothes as alleged, but wore their own dress and were confined in a part of the building to themselves. The warden assured me that they were not shaved on the head on their entry into his prison, but that their hair was simply trimmed or cut off (but not short), as a necessary measure for personal cleanliness. I would suggest that at each camp where a large number of prisoners may be kept there should be as a part of the garrison defense two or more howitzers, which would be of great service in the event of trouble among the prisoners. Some good plan of cooking for the prisoners at all these large camps should be adopted, by means of which the Government could save very largely in expense, both in rations and fuel. By the present unorganized system at the larger camps very man takes care of himself, and thus wastes rations and uses as much fuel to cook his dinner as could otherwise be used to cook for twenty-five. If our brave soldiers whom the fortunes of war have thrown into the hands of the enemy as prisoners are as well treated as the rebel prisoners I have visited, then indeed might we rest comparatively easy while they are withheld from us. I have approved hereto on one sheet a brief synopsis of my report.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ORME,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
