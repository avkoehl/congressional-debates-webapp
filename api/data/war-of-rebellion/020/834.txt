to the defense of James Island, which could then be securely held by about one-fifth of the force at present required. I can but express my regret that when Cole's Island was abandoned the work at Battery Island was no strengthened and heavily armed and obstructions placed across the Stono at that point, which is quite narrow; whereas by locating Fort Pemberton where it is now all the Lower Stono and the landings on both of its banks have been abandoned to the enemy. A battery should also have been constructed at Legare's, to command the water approach and landing from Folly River.

White Point Battery and Chisolm's Mill are both important positions for the defense of the city and Ashley River.

The general commanding is of opinion that, with due regard for the safety of Savannah and other important points, the total re-enforcements he could collect in about one week's time for the defense of Charleston could not possible exceed 10,000 men of all arms, thus leaving still required, according to the estimate of the board, 6,563, or about three brigades, which would be located at present as follows, if they could be had, to wit: One brigade between the Edisto (Pon Pon) and Combahee; another in Saint Andrew's Parish, and the third to be used as a movable column, to re-enforce any point suddenly threatened by the enemy.

The want of a sufficient number of negroes has been long felt, and has materially crippled the orificial defenses of Charleston.
