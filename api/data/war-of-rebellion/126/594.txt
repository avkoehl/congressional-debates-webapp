ALEXANDRIA AND WASHINGTON RAILROAD.

You will turn over the Washington, Georgetown and Alexandria Railroad to that company in accordance with letter of instructions from Quartermaster-General's Office, dated August 2, 1865; and also one dated May 19, 1865, copies of which are herewith inclosed. Mr. Joseph B. Stewart, secretary of said railroad company, is authorized to receive the same.
