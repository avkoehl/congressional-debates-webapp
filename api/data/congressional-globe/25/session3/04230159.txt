Interference of Federal Officers in Elections—Mr. Wall.
Senate
them by tne censorship of public opinion a3 to
subject tnera to the test of the Constitution In
doui" so he may win the confidence of his felhjw-
citiiens by his declared opinions, or may become
identified with some great principle which con
ciliates their support All this is innocent and
piai&eworthy, even if the motive is the acquisition
of office, because it promotes the public good
Pan it be wise, or even ju&t, to punish as a crime,
when he attains office, what was patriotic and
praiseworthy wmle he was seeking it' Yet why
should office seeking and office holding thus be
separated by arbitrary enactments, which beotow
honors and confidence upon the one, and penalty
and ignominy upon the other, for doing the same
act! How is it possible foi any of the officers
enumerated in this bill freely to discuss public
men and measuies in private circles, in public
assemblies, m the newspapers, or even in the
unieserved confidence of social intercourse, when
an elector is present, before or aftei an election,
without subjecting himself to the sweeping pen
allies of this bill' It is unequal While one set
of functionaries under the Federal Government,
ai d all those of the State governments, and the
officers of the corporations of associated wealth,
are left with an unrestricted freedom of speech and
of the press, this bill puts a gag and fetteis upon
a few proscubed men, in respect to public men
and public measures Why this discrimination '
Are the proscribed officers more corrupt or liable
to corruption than other office-holders' Is it to
guard against the corrupting influence and patron
ageof the Federal Administiation ' If so, the effect
ot the bill would be still more objectionable, as in
degiading them by taking from them the lights
common to all others, it would prepate them to
become the willing instruments of corruption or
ambition This bill would create a caste among
office holders, deriving their authority from the
same high source, the people, and requiring the
same high qualifications to discharge their duties
Those enumerated would be degraded by the very
acceptance ofoffice, which would cutthem offfiom
all identity of feeling, interest, and sympathy with
their fellow-citizens, by the voluntary mutilation
of the veiy manhood of citizenship It converts
those officers into mutes It enforces temporary
outlawry of the. dearest and most inestimable rights
of citizenship, with a penalty suspended over their
heads dunng the continuance ofoffice, which may
be cut by a woid, message, wilting, or even a
look, doom them to become outcasts—political
lepers They would be dishonored by the very
act of surrendeimgsuch rights foi the meicenary
motives of pecuniary gam and lewaids of office,
and proclaim themselves slaves, and the fit instru-
ments for making slaves of others They would
find the badges of slavery and dishonoi written
upon their commissions It cieates a privileged
class ot office holders The President and his
Cabinet, the heads of bureaus and their clerks, the
officers of Congress, thejudiciary and their clerks,
and the district attorneys, the officers of theAimy
and Navy, m short, all the Federal officers whose
emoluments are greatest, and whose sphere of in-
fluence is most extensive, are left free, while those
who derive their compensation fiom fees given for
labor performed in the execution of their duties,
or their daily suppoit from their daily labor in the
offices or employments enumerated, are prohibited
from intermeddling m elections, byword or deed,
save only by giving their own vote Is it to
lecogmze distinctions in society, grades of virtue
in office-holders' Is it to imply that the pro-
scribed office holders, being chiefly subordinate,
and many of them hard-working men, must" have
bridles in their mouths, and saddles upon their
backs," as a preliminary qualification for office'
Why should those officers be rendered aliens, and
be cut off from the enjoyment of the social rights
of discussing political subjects, even under the
protection of their own household gods, while the
other functionaries of the Federal and State Gov-
ernments, and the officers of the corporations of
associated wealth, and the employes of private
persons are permitted to retain the full rights of
citizens > This bill degrades the rights of suffrage,
the guardian of all political rights by meting it out
as a boon m different portions to different citizens,
all equally worthy of trust, and distinguished by
popular favor, and bj placing it under an odious
espionage
It sunounds the proscribed officers with a body
of common informéis, stimulated by two of the
| strongest incentives to constant vigilance—the
| hope of gam, and the desae of office—to watih
I then every word, message, wilting, lock, or ac
i tion, to tortuie it into an endeavor to peisuade,or
u> dissuade, an elector, in giving his vote, or m-
teimeddling in an election By day and by night,
in pubheand m private, in the election of a Pieoi
dent oi a Governoi, of a constable oi a pound-
keeper, the omnipresent eye of this new body of
famihais is alike upon the collector and his cart-
man, the superintendent of the public woiks, and
the day laborer in his employ Where is the
limit to be found in this bill which separates free-
dom oí speech and of the press fiom its operation'
I The open, manly independence of thought and
liberty of action, heretofore justly considered the
1 best preservatives of our mstuutioi s, must soon
perish undei the parasitic embrace of this bill It
not only pui ishes the freedom of action, but of
thought It forbids the designated peison, as well
fiom intermeddling m any Federal oi State elec-
tion, as fiom using any means with intent to con
trol or influence the same, thus introducing a new
crime m oui code, without precision or technical
definition, broad and comprehensive as the theater
of human action, and expansiveas human thought
on political subjects While it deprives one class
of Federal officers of a portion of their rights, it
bestows the most latitudmanan power upon another
class, the furtnest removed from the influence of
the people—the judiciary Them it clothes with
junsdiction to decide what is an endeavor to pur-
suade, or to dissuade, an elector to give his vote,
what act is an intermeddling in an election, and
what is using any means with intent to influence
or control the same. It is stamped with the most
odious and miserable impress of tyranny, vague
ncss, and uncertainty It may well be doubted
whether the end—the purity and freedom of elec-
tion—would justify such means, a delegation of
such undefined power, even to the purity of the
sacred ermine The history of other countries is
full of warning upon this subject. The Spanish
Inquisition, with all its terrible atrocities, was
reared upon quite as slender a foundation Its
pioposed object was to render religion pure and
uncorrupt, and, for that avowed holy purpose, the
most latitudmanan power was given to its reunis-
teis To prevent heresy in reli¿ion, they had, or
soon assumed for that purpose, the power to punish
all persons who endeavored to "persuade" or
"dissuade" others, or m anywise "intermeddle"
in matters of religion Hence, also, they gradually
assumed cognizance of the intentions, and even
the thoughts of men, and the tendencies of their
words and writings, in the streets and in the sacred
privacy of the closet, on a subjectof universal ron
cern and eveilastmg interest, and subjected them
to the never sleeping eye of a body oí informers,
under the name of familiars 1 he paiallel between
the bill referí ed to the committee and the origin of
the Inquisition, is as striking as it is alai mmg, and
differs less m the means than the end, the one
being designed to render religion pure and uncor
rupt, and the other to preserve the elective fran
chise pure and uncorrupt The delegation of such
unlimited power corrupted even sacred the priest-
hood, and religious heresy became the means of
their power, and the terrible instiument of their
maliceortyranny Arelaymen more pureor safer
depositaries of unlimited discretion ' May it not be
justly apprehended that political heresy may be-
come, in the hands of thejudiciary, as formidable
a means of power and as vindictive an instrument
of malice and tyranny ' " Confidence is eveiy-
' where the parent of despotism, free government
' is founded m jealousy not confidence It is
'jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited
' constitutions, to bind down those whom we are
' obliged to trust with power."
The committee believe that the spirit of our
institutions is onward, and that it is more consist-
ent with that spirit to look upon the rums of the
Inquisition which have fallen before the progress of
human liberty, as monuments of its triumph, than
to find materials to reconstruct new fortresses, from
which to assail the imprescriptible rights of man
The magm udeof the discretional y power com-
mitted by this oill to thejudiciary has a tendency
to conven our form of Government into a judicial
despotism, quite as intolerable to a free people,
and equally odious as any other The history of
the Star Chamber, like that of the Inquibition,
proves that no class, however venerated and ele-
vated, is the safe depositoiy of unlimited discre
tionary power, even for the most holy and salutary
ends The most dangeious and destiuctive assaults
upon human rights have been made from fortresses
constructed for then defense It deseives seuoua
consideration whether a law like this bill could
ever be carried into execution at this day, and
under our free institutions, a law which prostrates
the freedom of thought, of action, of speech, and
of the press, so far as respects a large portion of
the most intelligent, respected, and meritorious of
our citizens 1 he great body of the functionaries
whom this bill would affect have been honored by
the selection of the people to discharge responsible
duties, tor their honesty, capacity, and fidelity to
the Constitution The habitual reviler of repub-
lican institutions, and of the capacity of the people
for self government, may m vain attempt to fix «
stigma upon all officers who derive their appoint-
ments fiom the people, for the purpose of thus
gradually undermining their confidence in theGov-
ernment of their choice, but thepeoplewill always
be found true to themselves, and will never submit,
to theexecution ofa law which deprives theirfellow-
citizen of his common and equal rights, simply be-
cause they had distinguished him by their favor
and preference In the opinion of the committee
this bill would arm a body of informers with dan-
gerous powers In the contest of parties it may
happen that the State functionaries may unite with
the corporations of associated wealth, m a party
struggle to obtain the power of the Federal Gov-
ernment, armed with the tremendous enginery o<
this law, actions of debt, bill, or plaint, in any
district or circuit court of the United States, and
penalty and costs, is theie not reason to fear that
it would be used with ruinous effect against any ol
the proscribed officers, who would not use " the
great poweis" given to the officers of the federal
Government to piomote the views of the office
seekeis' On the other hand, would it not enable
a corrupt Administration to punish thera foi an
independent exercise of their judgment in like
manner' The committee will only advert to ona
other objection to the policy of this bill Its ob-
vious tendency is to alienate the people from the
Federal Government by infusing a jealousy of jts
powers and its officers, by unjust discriminations
between the two sets of fu           arles chosen by
the people to carry on the two coordinate depart-
ments of the one single and integral Government,
formed by the compact of the States, to array tha
State governments and its functionaries against
the Federal Government and its functionaries,
and thus gradually to undermine or weaKen it by
tieating as aliens in the State governments thosa
who accept office under the Federal Government.
In short, its tendency would be to " alienate one
portion of the country from the rest, and to en-
feeble the sacred ties which now link together the
various paits," and therefore, in the opinion of
the committee, it ought to be resisted m the be-
ginning
The committee are aware that a precedent may
be found for the principles of this bill, and almost
its language, in the legislation of England So also
may be found a precedent for the total disfran-
chisement of the officers of the customs, excise
duties, and post office, while holding office Such
a plant may be indigenous in such a soil Here
it must ever bean exotic, fiom the essential differ-
ence between the two Governments In the Brit-
ish Government, the jealousy of encroachment on
the rights of the people is confined to the King
The representatives of the people are considered
not only exempt themselves from distrust, but
likewise the guardians of the people against such
encroachments Hence, there, it is a principle
that Parliament is omnipotent, and all barriers are
raised, not against the Parliament, but the prerog-
ative of the King Here, all power emanates from
the people, and the Constitution, which is para-
mount to all laws, secures them as well against
legislative as executive usurpation The committee
