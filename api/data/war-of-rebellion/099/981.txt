CHARLESTON, January 2, 1865.

Major-General McLAWS:

If you are forced to evacuate your line at Pocotaligo you will fall back to the line of the Combahee River, paying especial attention to the guarding of all works and ferries. The order for Chesnut to go to Adams' Run should have been issued through you; it was authorized.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

CHARLESTON, January 2, 1865.

Major-General McLAWS:

Send General Chesnut's command to the Fourth Sub-District, Adams' Run. Wheeler has been ordered to relieve Young at Grahamville, and send him to Coosawhatchie. When he arrives order the First South Carolina Militia to report to Brigadier-General Taliaferro.

By order of Lieutenant-General Hardee:

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ON THE PURYSBURG ROAD, AT INTERSECTION

WITH HARDEEVILLE ROAD,

January 2, 1865--11 a. m.

Brigadier-General HUMES,

Commanding, Hardeeville:

GENERAL: Colonel Pointer reports to me that the enemy have halted at Hardee's house, which is about one mile nearer than Cheves' house, and about two miles and half from this point. They are now past the worst of the obstructions in the Hardeeville road. They have probably halted until they have built the bridge over Cheves' canal, near the signal tower, and cleared the road so as to bring up their artillery.

Very respectfully,

R. H. ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HARDEEVILLE, January 2, 1865.

Major-General McLAWS:

Scouts report the enemy encamped in heavy force at the signal tower, on the road from Screven's Ferry to Hardeeville, three miles from Screven's Ferry, and that they are still crossing the river and coming to that point.

W. Y. C. HUMES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HARDEEVILLE, January 2, 1865--12 m.

Major General L. McLAWS:

The enemy are advancing on the road from Cheves' house to Monkey Johns'. They have driven in Brigadier-General Anderson's scouting parties and are now within three-quarters of a mile of his position and still advancing.

W. Y. C. HUMES,

Brigadier-General.
