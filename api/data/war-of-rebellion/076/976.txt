Major-General CLEBURNE, East Point, Ga.:

General Hood thinks the enemy will hardly give you battle to-day. Better block all the roads leading from Camp Creek Church toward East Point if not already done. Keep an infantry picket at Hornsby's. Use pioneers to push forward works. He will send you troops if pressed.

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
