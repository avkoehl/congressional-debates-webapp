GENERAL: Your dispatch of this date * is just received. I am now within 4 miles of Purcellville, and think it best to proceed on than to turn back to my old camp.

I shall send you word this evening if there is any force in the vicinity of Snickersville. Everything is quiet, as far as I can learn.

Would it not be well to inform me of the whereabouts of Sigel's troops and of others I may come in contact with?

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, &c.

PURCELLVILLE, October 27, 1862 - 1.30 p. m.

GENERAL: My advance drove some rebel cavalry pickets out of this place, and find a small force some 2 1/2 miles from this on the road to Snickersville. I have sent the Eighth New York, Colonel Davis, to see what they have and what force there is at Snickersville.

I am inclined to believe it is only a small cavalry force, and that they have nothing of any consequence on this side of the Shenandoah.

Shall I send for my wagons? Rations are out to-morrow.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General.
