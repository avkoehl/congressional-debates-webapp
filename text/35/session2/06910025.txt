OCEAN" AND FOREIGN MAIL SERVICE.
The aggregate amount of postage (sea, inland,
and foreign) on mails transported from July 1,
1857, to February 19, 1858, by the steameis of
the New York and Liverpool (Collins) line was
$111,192 52; and by temporary steamships em-
ployed on same line during residue of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1858, #41,637 13, making a
total of $152,829 65, postages for the year. The
postages by this line during the year ending June
30, 1857, amounted to $210,463 03.
The postages upon mails conveycd during the
last fiscal year by the United States steamers of
the New York, Southampton, and Bremen line,
were $102,603 09, and by the New York, South
ampton, and Havre line, $105,923 26, being a
decrease of $35,151 69 by the Bremen, and an
increase of $7,973 21 by the Havre line, as com-
pared with the previous fiscal year.
The amount of letter postages upon mails ex-
changed with Great Britain during the year end-
ing June 30, 1858, was $802,771 64; with Prus-
sia, $325,763 60; Bremen, $27,905 92; France,
$205,826 42; Hamburg, $15,879 74; being a de-
crease on Biitish mails of $71,423 11; on Prus-
sian mails of $1,108 97; on Bremen mails of
$24,177 07; and an increase on French mails of
$164,638 23, and on Hamburg mails of $14,820 14,
compared with the preceding year. Net increased
letter postages on European mails, $82,749 22.
The postal arrangements with France and Ham-
burg which have recently gone into operation,
have caused a diversion of much of the corre-
spondence with the continent of Europe heretofore
exchanged via England and via Bremen to the
routes via France and via Hamburg, which ac-
counts for the large decrease on British and Bie-
men mails during the past year.
The total postages on letter mails exchanged with
Europe was $1,378,147 32. On mails sent to Gieat
Britain, $380,180 58; to Prussia, $193,765 95; to
Bremen, $11,866 36; to France, $101,414 66; and
to Hamburg, $10,30837. Total sent, $697,535 92.
On mails received from Great Britain, $422,591 06;
from Prussia, $131,997 65; from Bremen,$16,039
56; from France, $104,411 76; and from Ham-
burg, $5,571 37. Total received, $680,611 40.
Total postages collected in the United States,
$842,624 53; in Great Britain, Prussia, Bremen,
France, and Hamburg, $535,522 79. Excess of
postage collected in the United States, $307,101 74.
Total postages for the year from the New York,
Aspinwall, and California lines, $306,747 47;
from the Charleston and Havana line, $9,125 42;
and from the New Orleans and Vera Cruz line,
$4,359 37.
I regret that, since the expiration of the con-
tracts for the Bremen and Havre lines, our ocean
mail steamship service to Europe has not been
established on any permanent basis. The ships
of the New York and Liverpool line were with-
drawn in the month of February, 1858, and no
service has been performed under the Collins coil-
tract since that time. This contract being with
the Navy Department, the Postmaster General
had no control over it, and of course no power
either to enforce fulfillment or to annul for repeat-
ed failures, as in the case of ordinary mail con-
tracts. The temporary contracts for service to
Southampton, Bremen, and Havre expiring on
the 1st of June last, I was very solicitous, either
that the trips upon the Collins line should be re-
sumed, or that the contract should be declared at
an end, so that by new arrangements I could se-
cure the full number of weekly trips, by Ameri-
can vessels, neccssary to alternate regularly with
the ships of the Cunard line. Hence, soon after
the adjournment of Congress, I sought to ascer-
tain whether or not I could depend on the resump-
tion of service under the Collins contract; but it
was not until quite late in the summer that I could
obtain any reliable information on the subject.
At length a proposition was made to resume the
service, piovided the ships could be allowed to
make Portland, instead of New York, the Amer-
ican terminus of the line This proposition was
declined by the Navy Department, and, the con-
tract still remaining in force, it was out of my
power to engage other than temporary service by
the single trip on that line, as authorized by a
provision in the first section of the act of last ses-
sion making appropriations for ocean steamship
mails. This delay and uncertainty in respect to
this line had the effect, also, independently of any
other cause, to prevent the making of any per-
manent contracts for the other lines necessary to
furnish the full number of trips required; and the
result has been that all the service performed has
been entirely of a temporary character. Upon
the Collins line, up to the 30th of September, 1S58,
nine outward and seven inward trips have been
performed for the sea postage on the mails con-
veyed, at an average sum of $5,379 per round
trip, and five round ttips for the sea and inland
postage, amounting to $7,125 per trip. Upon the
Bremen line, from June 1, 1857, to October 21,
1858, inclusive, fourteen outward and fifteen in-
ward trips have been performed by Cornelius
Vanderbilt for the sea and United States inland
postage, averaging $8,621 per round trip; and
upon the New York and Havre line, from June
1, 1857, to October 6,1858, inclusive, the old con-
tractors have made sixteen round trips on same
terms, averaging $7,491 per trip.
The fourth section of the act of last session,
above referred to, provides that "it shall not be
lawful for the Postmaster General to make any
steamship or other new contract for carrying the
mails on the sea for a longer period than two
years, nor for any other compensation than the
sea and inland postages on the mails so trans-
ported;" and the fifth section of said act confines
the compensation to the sea postage only, if the
transportation is by a foreign vessel. Can the
service be obtained on these terms? 1 believe it
may be. If deemed expedient to employ foreign
vessels, it is certain that parties now stand ready
to take the mails for the sea postage. But shall
this service be relinquished entirely to foreign
steamers? and if not, will American lines con-
tract under the existing law ? Nothing is clearer
than that it is for the interest of this Government
to employ American in preference to foreign
steamers for the conveyance of our mails, if they
can be secured on the terms authorized by law;
but whether this may be done, is a matter of
doubt. Save during the winter months, there
would probably be no difficulty in getting the
mails carried on these teims; but for a period so
short as two years, it is hardly probable that con-
tracts with American lines could be obtained to
carry regularly the year round. To secure to
such lines their due share of the postages, it is
essential that perfect regularity should be ob-
served in winter as well as during the other months
of the year, by at least a weekly departure and
arrival on either side. The want of regularity
heretofore has had the effect to give the advantage
to the British lines. The evidence is now before
me, that of the correspondence, for instance, be-
tween the United States and Switzerland, out of
5,000 letters, 4,800 were transmitted by British
vessels, owing, it is believed, mainly to the cir-
cumstance of ihe known regularity of these ves-
sels in sailing on a given day. Why may not the
same regularity be established and maintained by
American ships ? Let this be done, and no good
reason is perceived why they may not catiry an
equal proportion of the mails, the postageon-which
would afford a fair compensation for t-he service.
This is susceptible of demonstration. Fur in-
stance, the aggregate amount of sea and United
States inland postages on the mails by the differ-
ent lines of United States and foreign mail pack-
ets between the United States and Europe, for
the year ending June 30, 1858, was $1,266,869.
This, for semi-weekly service, would give an
average of $12,181 the round trip, or at the rate
of $633,434 per annum for the weekly service de-
sired from an American line or lines, with tho
prospect of a steady increase from a constantly
increasing trade and correspondence.
As calculated to furnish the requisite facilities
of communication between Europe and the south- s
ern and southwestern States, the projected lines
between Norfolk and England and between New
Orleans and Bordeaux, in France, are among the
most important to be established. It is unneces-
sary to point out the advantages these lines would
be certain to have in developing the resources of
those States. They could not fail to be otherwise
than highly satisfactory. The lines to Bremen
and Havre, touching at Southampton, should be
continued; and, if practicable, increased to semi-
monthly service. A Bremen company are now
running fine steamers semi-monthly between New
York and Bremenhaven, carrying the mails for
the postages. If this can be done by parties in
Bremen, why not, also, by enterprising citizens of
the United States, and thus secure a regular and
permanent weekly communication ? Such an ar-
rangement would not only afford the best and
cheapest means for the transmission of the mails
between the United States and continental Europe,
and it may be to and from the East Indies by the
way of Trieste, but it would also be highly advan-
tageous in a commercial point of view. With re-
ference to an American overland communication
to India via Trieste, lam credibly informed that
negotiations are pending to this end between the
Lloyd Steamship Companies of Bremen and Tri-
este and the intermediate railroad companies; and
that it is intended to take effect so soon as a weekly
line is established between the United States ana
Bremen. It is believed that this route will fur-
nish cheaper and better facilities of communica-
tion than any existing route.
But if the compensation for ocean steamship
service is to be limited to the postages, it cannot
be expected that parties will contract for so short
a term as two years, and obligate themselves to
carry during the winter months. I would, there-
fore, respectfully recommend that the law be so
far modified as to extend the term for all such
contracts to a period not exceeding ten years, at
the discretion of the Postmaster General.
As regards a line from some suitable port in the
United States to Brazil, and the extension of the
California line frdm Panama to the south Pacific
coast, which, for commercial as well as for mail
purposes, it is so desirable should be established,
and the line from New Orleans to Vera Cruz, it
is apparent that the postages to be derived there-
from would defray but a trifling portion of the
expense of the service. I regard it as highly im-
portant that the line to Vera Cruz should be con-
tinued. From the 1st of July to the 1st of No-
vember of this year, there was no mail upon this
line, and temporary service is now performed for
the postages only, in the hope that Congress will
immediately authorize the making of a contiact
at a reasonable compensation. I respectfully rec-
ommend this, and that the same authority be
granted respecting lines to Btazil and the south
Pacific. The contract on the Charleston and Ha-
vana line will expire on the 30th of June next.,
and this, also, it is Apparent, will require other
aid than what could be derived from the postages
to sustain it. The Vera Cruz and Havana lines,
as well as the lines to California, should be classed
as coastwise; and, whether susceptible of being
sustained from the postages or not, should not,
in my judgment, be subject to that restriction.
But with reference to all lines where this restric-
tion is not, imposed, I would respectfully recom-
mend that the Postmaster General be prohibited
from "entering into any contract, except under
