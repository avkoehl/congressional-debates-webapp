Major N. L. JEFFRIES,

Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, Baltimore, Md.:

Consult the general commanding as to the propriety of drafting in both districts at once. If it is as safe to do so then that is best. If there is any danger of riot draw in one district at a time. Consult the Governor also on this point.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 12, 1863.

Recruiting stations will be established in the State of Tennessee for colored troops by Brigadier General Andrew Johnson, Military Governor. The foregoing order* is modified, in respect to the State of Tennessee, by such regulations as he may establish to promote enlistments, subject to the approval of the War Department.

By order of the President:

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 12, 1863.

Brigadier General ALLEN C. FULLER,

Adjutant-General State of Illinois, Springfield, Ill.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant stating that a colored regiment cannot be raised in Illinois for the reason that the rate of pay does not furnish a sufficient inducement for men to enlist.

I am directed by the Secretary of War to inform you that it is not in the power of the Department to offer any further inducement, as the law authorizing the employment of colored troops shall be paid "$10 per month, $3 of which monthly pay may be in clothing." All colored soldiers are paid in accordance with this enactment.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. FOSTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General of Volunteers.
