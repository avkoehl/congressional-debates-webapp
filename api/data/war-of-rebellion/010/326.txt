HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION OF THE ARMY OF THE OHIO, Camp on Field of Shiloh, April 12, 1862.

SIR: I desire to call the especial attention of the general commanding this army to the admirable hospital arrangements adopted by Dr. Irwin, U. S. Army, medical inspector of this division, during the battle of the 7th instant. They will be found as nearly perfect as the circumstances would allow. The wounded in this division did not suffer from the inclement weather; they were all promptly sheltered and cared for.

I beg to recommend Dr. Irwin to the favorable consideration of his superiors.

Very respectfully,WM. NELSON,

Brigadier-General.

Captain J. B. FRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Chief of Staff.
