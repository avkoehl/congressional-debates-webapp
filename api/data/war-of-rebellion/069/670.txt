GENERAL ORDERS.] HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

June 7, 1864.

Edward Crapsey, a correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer, having published in that journal of the 2nd instant a libelous statement on the commanding general of this army calculated to impair the confidence of the army in their commanding officer, and which statement the said Crapsey has acknowledged to have been false, and to have been based on some idle camp rumor, it is hereby ordered that he be arrested and paraded through the lines of the army with a placard marked "libeler of the press," and that he be then put without the lines and not permitted to return.

The provost-marshal-general will see that this order is promptly executed.
