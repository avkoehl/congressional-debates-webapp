brigade at the front, and on the morning of the 17th the command started on the march, and on the evening of the 20th joined the brigade at a point five miles from Kingston and one mile south of Cassville. On the 23rd of May the command moved with the brigade in a southwesterly direction and crossed the Etowah River at the covered bridge, and on that day and the 24th and 25th crossed the Allatoona range, and arrived in front of Dallas, near Pickett's Mills, on the 26th, the regiment being with the brigade in the reserve on the extreme left of our lines, the Twenty-third Corps, however, coming in on our left during the night. On the morning of the 27th the reserve of the brigade was formed of the Nineteenth Ohio, Seventy-ninth Indiana, and Ninth Kentucky Volunteers, under the command of Colonel Manderson, the Nineteenth Ohio being under my immediate command. In this order, about 8 a.m., we moved to the left and formed line of battle, fronting eastward, and advanced for about a half mile, the front line skirmishing with the enemy; we then moved a short distance by the left flank and again formed line, fronting southward, and in this direction advanced about a half a mile, when we again moved, by the left flank, a distance of two miles or more over a hilly and heavily wooded country; we again formed to the front and moved forward, the front lines soon striking the enemy, who were posted in force behind heavy field--works. The front lines having melted away under the heavy and destructive fire of the enemy, the reserve was ordered to the front, and advanced under a very heavy fire to an open field in front of the enemy's works, this command, taking rails, advanced into the open field and formed a slight rail barricade, behind which it lay and fought the enemy until dark. About 11 p.m. the enemy, having massed his forces, advanced under the cover of darkness and suddenly charged our lines; we fought him bravely, but being pressed by overwhelming numbers and without support, we were compelled to fall back about a half mile to the rear. We again formed our lines and lay upon our arms all night. In this action Captain Brewer was killed, Major Nash and Captain Smith were severely wounded, and 42 non-commissioned officers and privates of the regiment were killed, wounded, and taken prisoners, as shown in the annexed list.* In this position, alternating slightly from right to left, the command lay until the 6th day of June, having lost 1 man killed and 1 wounded on the skirmish line. The enemy having fallen back toward Marietta on the morning of the 5th, early on the morning of the 6th the command was moved to the left to within two and a half miles of Acworth. Here it lay until the morning of the 10th, when it moved about two miles to the front. From this time to the 17th it lay in front of the enemy, advancing gradually and forcing the enemy back, Captain Firestone, Company A, having been slightly wounded on the 16th. On the night of the 16th the enemy fell back about two miles, and on the morning of the 17th we moved forward in pursuit. Being in advance, Companies A and K were sent forward as skirmishers and drove the enemy's skirmishers back to within a few rods of their line of works. Skirmished with the enemy all day, the loss in the command being 2 killed and 8 wounded. (See list annexed.) On the 18th again skirmished with the enemy, who opened on the command with artillery. Our loss this day was 1 killed and 3 wounded. (See list annexed.) On the night of the 18th
