THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

portion of them we have recommended be
non-concurred in.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Mr. Speaker,
in discussing the deficiency bill, a bill of appro-
priations, considerable latitude of debate must
necessarily be allowed. I do not intend to
transgress any points of order which I well
understand; but I hope I will not be arrested
captiously on mere points of order, without
any understanding of the tendency or drift of
the facts which I propose to bring before the
House.
I am not in that state of health or in such
spirits as will enable me to address the
House on political questions, or to excite
political feeling or tariff feeling, if I may so
express myself, even were I disposed to do it.
What I do propose, however, is to show to the
House that we are now raising $100,000,000
of surplus revenue beyond what is necessary
to carry on the Government; and the natural
result of such an enormous surplus is to tempt
this House, to tempt the country, to tempt the
lobby around this House to demand not only
enormous appropriations, but to add on defi-
ciency bills of every kind and every character.
When Senators or the Finance Committee of
the Senate look to this surplus of $100,000,000
they not only naturally transcend all the pre-
cedents of preceding Congresses, that is, of
having but one deficiency bill in every session,
but they add on, as at the last session, two or
three deficiency bills. And at this extra ses-
sion of this Congress, as the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes] has well shown,
the Senate have attached to an appropriation
bill all sorts of legislation and all sorts of
omitted jobs, in order to absorb this enormous
surplus of $100,000,000 which it is supposed
will be in the Treasury of the United States
this year.
Under this exhibit of facts I deem it the
duty of the House, and regret that it has not
coincided with me in the opinion, not further
to make appropriations, but to look at the
revenues, the resources of the country, and at
the public debt as statesmen should look, and
to alleviate the sufferings of the people by
reducing, as near as possible, the taxation to
the amount of the surplus, and the reduction to
be not only in the external revenue, but also in
the internal revenue.
It is now necessary for me, Mr. Speaker, in
order to sustain these remarks, to show that
Statement of receipts for the fiscal year.
this fiscal year, beginning July 1, 1870, and
ending June 30, 1871, will exhibit a surplus
of $100,000,000. Of this fiscal year more than
ten months have already passed, and we have
the Treasury record of the revenues for three
quarters of that fiscal year. I desire to sub-
mit this record to the considerate men not
only on dNe of the House, but on the other
side, who doubtless desire as much as we do
to relieve their constituents from the enorm-
ous taxation imposed upon them, both by cus-
toms duties on the sea-coast and on the lakes,
and in a more direct form through the assess-
ors and collectors in the agricultural and man-
ufacturing districts of the country.
The records of the customs receipts for three
quarters of the fiscal year show an increase
beyond all calculation. The receipts of inter-
nal revenue, which were expected to be largely
reduced, are far beyond the expectations of
those who made the reduction. A much larger
sum than was calculated upon has been re-
ceived, and will, according to an estimate
recently put forth by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, yield during the fiscal year
11-15,000,000.
I now submit the following table:

This table shows that the custom-house rev-
enues this year will be $199,802,231. Estimat-
ing the internal revenue, not at $14-5,000,000,
as the Commissioner of Internal Kevenue esti-
mates it, but as it is estimated at the Treasury
Department, at only $134,231,632, our income
this fiscal year will reach the enormous sum
of $369,392,295; a large excess on the calcu-
lations of any of the members of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, who reported the bill
passed by this House, and beyond the calcula-
tions of any members who last summer took
part in the enactment of the existing tariff and
revenue laws.
We have in the annual report of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury his estimates for the rev-
enue of this fiscal year, and the amouut is
$185,729,000. The result as actually shown in
his Department is to be at least $199,802,000 ;
probably $200,000,000, if not more. The last
fiscal year, ending June 30, 1870, the revenue
from customs was $194,538,000. Now, while
in July last we supposed thatwe wereactualiy
reducing the tariff, we were really increasing
the revenue for the present fiscal year from
$194,538,000 to $199,802,000; that is, over
five millions.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. _ Is not that
increase due to the great increase in the amount
of importations? The gentleman, I suppose,
would not imply that the rates of the tariff
were not reduced?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Oh, no; I
intend to be perfectly fair.
Mr. KELLEY. Will the gentleman permit
me to make a suggestion? The modifications
in the tariff did not take effect until the lst
of January of the present year, and the receipts
have not been made up for the quarter during
which the reduced rates have been operating.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. In connec-
tion with this subject it must be borne in mind
that in estimating the revenues of a great coun-
try it is always necessary to take into consid-
eration the actual growth of a country like this
in its wants and consumption ; and also that
great fact in political economy, that in propor
tion as we lessen taxation and reduce the
cost of articles the greater the consumption,
the greater the importation ; and hence that
proportionate greater amount of revenue from
that large importation and consumption.
Mr. KELLEY. The statement of the gen-
tleman is so candid that I want to express gen-
erally my concurrence, not my dissent; but
I wish to call his attention to the fact, as shown
by the figures before me, that the last half of
the year will not yield so largely as the first
half.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. The gentle-
man cannot be certain of that. The table
above indicates to the contrary. The New
York custom-house returns show the con-
trary. The Chief of the Bureau of Statistics
hassubmitted to Congress its estimated reduc-
tion of receipts under the new (July) tariff,
and that reduction was, net, $20,054,748.
Mr. KELLEY. That was for the year.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. That was on
the new tariff—the reduction of the new tariff.
Mr. KELLEY. On annual receipts.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Lbeg the
House to bear in mind while we were largely
increasing in the last Congress the number
of free articles, and thereby making things
cheaper to the manufacturers of the country,
if not cheaper to consumers, we were also
largely increasing on many articles the rates
of tariff, such as flax not hackled or dressed;
flax, tow of; sunn, hemp; jute, butts; bottles
containing liquors; watches, and parts of 
Mr. KELLEY. Not on watches, but parts
of watches.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Parts of
watches. To go on with the enumeration:
oil, linseed and flaxseed ; oil, seal ; oil of cot-
ton-seed ; linseed and flaxseed; corsets, or
manufactured cloth, woven ormadein patterns,
value six dollars per dozen, or less; corsets,
or manufactured cloth, woven or made in pat-
terns, value over six dollars per dozen ; eye-
lets of all kinds; flax straw; silicate of sodo,
orotheraikalinesilicates ; wroughtscrap iron ;
sword-blades; swords 
Mr. KELLEY. We changed the rates on
swords and sword-blades, making a reduction
in the rate of sword-blades, but making no
increase on swords.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. This does not
show it. To continue with the articles: steel
railway bars, a great increase; railway bars in
part of steel ; round iron in coils, three six-
teenths of an inch or less in diameter, whether
coated with metal or not, &c.; crinoline, cor-
set, and hat steel wiic. In one district of Mas-
sachusetts, the Worcester district, represented
by a c-lever gentleman on this floor, by that
action some $300,000 were voted annually into
the pockets of one wire manufactory there,
and when their laborers struck for ten hours'
instead of eleven hours' labor, notwithstand-
ing our generosity, the company refused to
grant the boon to their workmen unless at
reduced wages. Hair cloth, (crinoline cloth ;)
hair-pins, (iron wire;) gun-wads of all kinds.
The duty oti gun-wads has been created or
increased.
Mr. IIOOPER, of Massachusetts. Gun-wads
were put in on my motion, the object being
to reduce the duty, they being partially man-
ufactured of wool and coming in under the
high rate of articles partly manufactured of
wool, which reduced them to the rate of'thirty-
five per cent.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. The gentle-
man is mistaken. The rate added on gun-wads
has increased the tax. The gentleman from
Massachusetts would not introduce a bill to
reduce the duty on anything manufactured by
his constituents.
But without entering further into particulars,
Mr. Speaker, or disputing on little matters, the
important fact is shown in a table 1 exhibit
that instead of reducing the external rev-
enue, as we intended, we have this fiscal year
increased it over five million dollars.
Mr. Speaker, I now hold in my hands what,
are the expenditures of the country for the last
fiscal year. I am glad to see, especially in the
Army and Navy, in consequence of the legis-
lation of Congress, there is no inconsiderable
