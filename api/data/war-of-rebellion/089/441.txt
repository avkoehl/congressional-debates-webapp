FORT BRADY, VA., October 30, 1864.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I have been in and around the canal a good portion of the day. Very strangely, there has been less shelling and more casualties than for several days previous; 1 man killed and 2 wounded, and 2 horses killed outright. Major Ludlow acknowledges, however that the 4.5-inch gun does the business effectually. Received the new projectile; shall make a careful report of its efficacy. General Butler sent me to-day forty-nine boxes and six barrels, the boxes containing 100-pounder shell and the barrels incendiary composition. Am directed to store them in magazine until further orders. Will send you a copy of my report to him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
