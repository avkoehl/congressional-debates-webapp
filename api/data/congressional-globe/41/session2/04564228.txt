THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 8,
lawful money of the United States, an amount equal
to at least fifteen per cent, of the aggregate amount
of its notes in circulation and of its deposits.
The average, you may say, being twenty per
cent, of the amount of circulation and deposits.
The amount of deposits now is about equal
to double the amount of circulation. So that
the circulation and deposits added together
amount, to some eight hundred and fifty to nine
hundred million dollars, from which there must
be a deduction of about twenty per cent., mak-
ing the whole reserve form from one hundred
and sixty to one hundred and eighty million
dollars.
Now, let. me call the attention of the House
more particularly to the existing reserve, as
reported by the Comptroller of the Currency.
The last report of the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency shows this to be their condition :
In V;se month of January, 186!), the amount
of reserves required was $ 108,000,000 of legal
lender; ih:!t was required on an issue of
;J 15:SO,()!.:{). ,00. The required reserve was
JiJa.u.tJ.Ov.) more than one half of the amount
of national bank currency in circulation. Of
the it's,'I've at that, time there was held in Uni-
ted Siates notes the sum of $88,239,300. In
the month of April the required reserve was
$159,000,000, while the reserve of legal tenders
was $80,875,161, the balance being- made up of
three per cent, certificates and coin. In J tine,
18B0, the required reserve was $165,000,000,
in round numbers, and the reserve of United
States notes was $80,934,119. In October
the required reserve was, in round numbers,
$160,000,000, and the reserve of United States
notes was $83,719,295.
I am therefore justified in saying that the
reserve regularly in hand was over eighty million
dollars of United States notes upon the pres-
ent banking circulation of $300,000,000, being
more than half the amount required by law; the
remainder of the reserve being made up of spe-
cie, three per cents., balances due batiks in re-
demption cities, and clearing-house certificates.
Now, if you will add,to that the $45,000,000
of United States notes to be substituted in the
place of the three per cent, certificates which
this bill proposes to have taken from the reserve
of tlio bunks you have a legal-tender reserve
of $128,710,275 on a currency circulation of
$300,000,000; that is, upon the amount of cir-
culation at present. Add to it $95,000,000, which
this bill proposes, take twofil'thsof that amount
for reserve, and you will then have $166,000,-
000 of reserve to bo abstracted from the circu-
lation. The full amount of the legal-tender
currency is $356,000,000, mid if you take from
that §160,000,000, you will havelel't but $190,-
000,000 of greenbacks in actual circulation in
the United States. That amount, with the
$395,000,000 of national bank currency, will
make your total circulation 8585,000,000.
Ihat (is the effectof the first section of this
bill, ihe present amount of circulation is
made up by adding $300,000,000 of bank cir-
culation to the $273,000,000 which is left after
deducting the amount held as bank reserves,
and is $573,000,000.
But ss I said before, the second section of
this bill takes away $40,000,000 of national
notes, united States notes, now in circulation,
leaving in circulation $150,000,000 of United
States notes. _ That added to $395,000,000 of
bank circulation, makes in all but $545,000,000
circulation in place of the §300,000,000 of
national bank notes, and $*273,000,000 United
States notes, making in all $573,000,000, or
a, decrease of the present circulation of the
country to the extent of $28,000,000, under the
provisions of this bill.
Then if there was no other objection to this
bill, that alone would constitute an insuper-
able argument against it. We know the evils
of contraction. 1 am not here to-day to say
one word about the evils of contraction. The
chairman of the Committee on Banking and
Currency [Mr. Gajifielu, of Ohio,] intimated
m his speech that he"was iu favor of contrac-
tion, and that he was sorry that the Govern-
ment bad not taken the direction of contrac-
tion, and by that means returned to specie pay-
ments. Let me say that if this measure is car-
ried out the gentleman can be gratified to his
heart's content, for in my opinion no more
radical measure of contraction could possibly
be adopted than the one before the House
to-day, and on that account itcan never obtain
my assent.
Let me call the attention of the House a
little further to the provisions of this bill.
There is one clause in the latter part of the
first section of the bill which provides " that
no banking association hereafter organized
shall have a circulation in excess of five hun-
dred thousand dollars." I object to that pro
vision on this ground. There are some cities
in the West, such as St. Louis, Louisville,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, and De-
troit, which would be entitled to some banks
under this bill, and those banks should be
allowed a circulation exceeding five hundred
thousand dollars each.
The banks in the city of New Orleans alone,
as I am credibly informed, could take from
twelve to fifteen millions of this circulation.
Several of the banks have over a million of
capital. St. Louis could take five or six mil-
lions; Louisville, three or four millions; Nash-
ville, $2,000,000; Chicago, $5,000,000; Mo-
bile, $2,000,000. And iu each of these cities
the banks are large and wealthy. It. seems to
me unfair to limit the circulation which shall
be issued to any of the banks ia those cities,
while the cities now favored with their share
of circulation are not thus limited. Let this
matter be open. Let there be large banks as
well as small banks. Impose no shackles upon
any section of the country in the passage of a
biil of this kind.
In the second section it, is provided that
$45,000,000 of three per cents, shall be taken
up from the reserves, and that not less than
that amount of greenbacks shall bo put in their
place. Let me read the language of that pro-
vision :
That, at the end of each month after the passageof
this act it shall bo the ilaty of the Comptroller of the
Currency to report to the Secretary of the Treasury
the amount of circulating notes issued, underthe pro-
visions of the preceding section, to national banking
associations during the previous month; whereupon
the bcerotary of the Treasury shall redeem and can-
cel an amount of the three per cent, temporary loan
certificates issued under the acts of March 2,1387, and
July 25,1SSS, not,less than tho amount of circulating
notes so reported.
Now this section should be amended by in-
serting after tlie-word "not," in the last line,
the words " moro than eighty per cent.," and
strikeout the words "less than the amount," so
that tho Secretary can redeem and cancel not
more than eighty per cent, of the amount of
circulating notes issued; because if you put,
$45,000,000 of United States notes iu place of
£45,000,000 in three per cents, now used as a
reserve, and upon that issue only $45,000,000
ot bank notes, then in order to equalize the
currency on the present basis, you must calcu-
late lor an addition on tho amount of reserve
that will be required on the §45,000,000. What
is that? About one fifth, which would be
$9,000,000. _ If you undertake to equalize the
currency by issuing bank notes in lieu of green-
backs put in the reserve, you must not only
issue a like amount of bank notes, but in addi-
tion to that the amount that is necessary for
the reserves on circulation and deposits. So
that after all, instead of equalizing the currency
by issuing bank notes for United States notes,
you, by issuing this $45,000,000, decrease the
amount to the extent of two fifths of $45,000,-
000, which is $18,000,000. This is the result,
unless my arithmetic has deceived me. I can-
not calculate a question in simple addition and
subtraction, if the result of this clause of this
bill is not a diminution of the currency to the
amount of §18,000,000.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. HOLM AN. I trust that further time
will be given to my colleague. I presume there
will be no objection to giving him ten minutes
additional.
The SPEAKER pro tempore, (Mr. Ambleb
in the chair.) Is there objection?
Mr. POLAND. Mr. Speaker, I have no
objection whatever to an extension of the
gentleman's time; but I understand that the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Garfield,] who
has charge of this bill, has given notice that
at four o'clock to-day, or shortly before that
time, he will call for a vote upon the bill.
Sir. INGERSOLL, He cannot get a vote
on it unless the House sustains the previous
question.
Mr. POLAND. There are several gentle-
men, myself among the number, who desire
to speak on this bill; and although I do not
wish to shorten any gentleman's time, 1 do not
want to extend the time unless there can be
some understanding as to taking the vole at a
later period than has been indicated.
The SPEAKElt pro tempore. The Chair
understands the gentleman rrom Vermont to
object to an extension of tune.
Mr. POLAND. i object to an extension
unless the gentleman having charge ot the bill
will allow us furl her time fn' the discussion.
The SPEAKKit pro tempore, itie Chair
cannot entertain any conditional objection.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I rise to a parliament-
ary inquiry. 1 wish to know wlietaar if ttie
House should vote down tue previous question
the gentleman who has charge of the bill
would not lose control of it; whether it would
not then be absolutely under the control of the
House, or of some member opposed to the
demand for the previous question, and whether
debate would not thus be open at the will of
the House.
The SPEAKElt pro tempore. There is no
doubt that is right.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I hope that, course will
be taken.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will slate, as
he has taken the Chair for that purpose, that
unless the bill is disposed of to-day it will have
no further claim on this blouse during this ses-
sion unless by unanimous consent.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Can we not arrange this
matter by a two-thirds vote on Monday next?
The SPEAKER. Yes, sir; on Monday next
the rules may be suspended for the purpose of
giving whatever time for the consideration of
this bill may be considered necessary.
Mr. INGERSOLL. On next Monday we
can order such disposition in regard to debate
on this bill as may seem to the House to be
proper.
The SPEAKER. The House, by a two-
thirds vote on Monday next after the morning
hour, can do what it pleases.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I hope the gentleman
from Indiana will be allowed to proceed.
There was no objection.
_ Mr. COB URN. I am opposed to the sec-
tions of the bill providing for gold notes. That
is an artful device to drag every gold dollar
out of the Treasury. The banks issuing gold
notes may keep on hand twenty-five per cent,
of^ the amount of their circulation in coin.
W hen a panic comes the gold will all be drawn
out. The banks cannot stand the run on a
circulation of four to one, and must suspend.
Then, it is the duty of the Government to pay
off the notes it has indorsed. One day of
panic such as transpired last fail would take
out of our national vaults every dollar. There
is very little coin in the country outside of the
Treasury; surely no amount sufficient foi; a
foundation for gold banking.
The evidence before the Committee on Bank-
ing and Currency in relation to the gold panic
of September, 1869, disclosed the remarkable
fact upon which the speculators based their
calculations, and that is this: that there were
but some $16,000,000 of gold coin outside of
the Treasury within reach of the market in all -
this country.
