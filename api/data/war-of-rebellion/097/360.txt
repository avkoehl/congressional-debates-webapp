Brigadier General R. DE TRIBRIAND,

Commanding First Brigade:

GENERAL: The brevet major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Hays, commanding Second Division, has been directed to relieve at once the line and pickets of this division as far as practicable. Immediately upon being relieved the troops of this division will relieve those of General Miles as far as the Boydton road. Staff officers from these headquarters will be upon the line. The Second and Third Brigades will occupy the new line.

Very respectfully,

Major DRIVER:

MAJOR: I have the honor to send you hereby two rebel prisoners. We advanced, and the first line was driven. They are near the ravine now, exposed to an enfilading fire. I have sent re-enforcements to our left. I don't think we can do anything.

R. McALLISTER,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, THIRD DIV., SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865.

[Major DRIVER:]

MAJOR: I have the honor to report the result of a reconnaissance of fifty men sent, under charge of Lieutenant Harrington, Eleventh Massachusetts Volunteers, in compliance with orders received from division headquarters. The party advanced about fifty yards in front of our pickets to within about fifteen yards of the enemy's rifle-pits. They were found to be a large and continuous line of pits, making a double line of battle. They at once opened a heavy fire, which prevented our small force from advancing any farther, and kept up the fire until we were obliged to fall back to our line of works.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. McALLISTER,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-7.30 a.m. (Received 7.42 a.m.)

Major-General WARREN:

A. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
