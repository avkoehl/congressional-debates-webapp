SEPTEMBER 21, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: As directed by you I have gathered up and forwarded to their respective commands several hundred disorganized troops, and have the work still going on by fifteen or twenty different escorts of generals, under their commissioned officers. I found the task comparatively easy, the men separated from their regiments being in high spirits and not at all cowed. It was generally necessary only to let them know where to go to find their commands.

I find the troops in fine spirits and ready to re-enter the fight, though they have suffered severe loss. What is left is all right. I have seen but one soldier to-day who seemed to be cowed. As I write, cheers are going up all over the field. There are not many stragglers now.

I am, &amp;c.,

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
