THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 21
no contingency about it. It must be in operation
usefully, pennanently, before we are to con-
tribute a cent. I hope we shall take up the bill
and pasa it at once. The Senator from Maine
lias told us why it is necessary to take it up and
act upon U now if we are to act at all. We can-
not be too quick about it. I did not rise to argue
the question, but only to say that presuming
there is a majority here that fully understand all
the bearings of the question, we may as well pass
upon it without fut ther argument as to spend* more
time in its discussion. One entire day has al-
ready been consumed over it, and I presume it
was then discussed in all its impoita.rU bearings,
which are remembered now and need not be re-
peated. I hope, sir, we shall take up the bill at
once and pass i? without fuithcr discussion.
Mr. GRIMES. If the Senators who are the
advocates of the passage of this biiisuppose they
are going to expedite its passage by characteriz-
ing the conduct of those who opposed it upon a
former occasion as petty and small they may pos-
sibly be reckoning without their host. So far as
I am concerned. I opposed the passage of this bill
from conscientious motives, and I propose to con-
tinue to do so; and it i.i not going to pass to-day
without thorough in\es ligation and argument,
such argument as shall not only be heard here,
but as I intend, so far as I am concerned, shall
be heard by my constituents and the country.
If the Senator hom Ohio and the Senator from
Michigan ore so anxious that this bill shall pass
without any further debate why do they rise here
and expatiate themselves upon the merits of the
pioposition, and why are they joined by the Sen-
ator from Maine? Is it supposed that those who
act from equally conscientious -motives in oppo-
sition to the passage of the btll will not say some-
thing m their own vindication and to justify their
own vote, justify the conduct they have hitherto
pursued, ;?nd thai winch they propose to pursue
hereafter?
i he ben at or from Ohio Miys he should be
ashamed to go to Kurope if the Senate should
higgle upon a qutsiion of this kind. Why, sir,
thiuc is no; a man in this body who is un willing
to do pii <_i*i\ what tin- iJiiiisii Government has
been Willing t<. do. We aie willing to grant the
ri^htot way; v.oaiv willing to give the lands, we
are willing that tes^-U-of-wai should beemploycd
in tianspoi ting, it you please, the material with
which tiie const1 m tton is to he made, ami in lay-
ing dqwn the cable and making the smveys and
.somnliu°s. What 1 object to in the subsidy,
which i.< not givi1,i by either the iiussian or the
IhifHi Uovrinnsent. Yvhyis it that Great lint-
am is itmv ilhng to give any subsidy when tins tele-
guiplnc lint: i* to connect her with her own im-
mediate po.-<,si .ision^, and that we are asked to
givo a subsidy when it j.-? only going to connect
lis with our consuls in hau'ope?
_ The Senator from Michigan has told usthuttbia

of ^0,000,000 if it had only been eons! i net ed at I he
time the Alabama was m the Chinese seas. Will
the Senator it 11 me how fir it is fnnu Helmut's

j knows, that this telegraphic line can be and will
i be constructed without any subsidy fiom us. It
I is in the hands of one of the iichesL companies on
; the face of the eaith. It does not belong to Mr.
, Collins. Whatever right Mr. Collins may have
derived from the British Government under what
is called the concession (which is neither more
nor less than a letter from the secretary of the
Duke of Newcastle stating the terms upon which
the right to construct this telegraph may be se-
cured) he has transferred to the Western Union
Telegraph Company, for winch he received the
sum of $100,000 down, and §1,000,000 in paid-up
stock of the company, with a stipulation that he
should be permitted to receive $1,000,000 more,
for which he is to pay. I hold in my hands aci'r-
i cular issued by the directors of the Western
1 Union Telegraph Company, dated March 24,
i 1864, and signed by O. H. Palmer, secretary of
| the company—a circular to the stockholders, in-
i forming them what steps had been taken to secure
j Mr. Colhns's interest, the amount of stock they
j proposed to increase after having secured it, and
j the manner in which they proposed to dispose of
| that stock. I will read it:

It would seem that tins company thought this i
grant was of vast value to them, and I apprehend
, that at the time they gave the ^100,000, and the
| $1,000,000 of paid-up stock, they did not think
\ it would be neccssaiy to come to Congress to ob-
j tutu a subsidy of ftoU0,000 to enable them to con-
j struct the line. The circular goes on:

What does this mean ? They provide that each
stockholder shall receive fifty per cent, in the new
stock, and that two million of the ten million shall
go to Perry McDonough Collins, and then the
" residue," after that distribution, shall "be dis-
tributed to such persons and in sucli amounts as
in the judgment of this boaid shall seem best cal-
culated to advance the substantial interests of this
