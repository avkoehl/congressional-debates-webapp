HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,August 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I can get the guns at work. The pioneers are trimming down the bushes. Shells are exploding constantly near my headquarters. I hope it is not Brannan's aiming down this way. Don't hear any other firing.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 10, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel W. T. CLARK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report after a careful examination by my engineer officers that no continuous defensive line can be formed in my present front, and that detached works can only be established a short distance in front of the left of General Harrow's line, which when erected, would not, in my judgment, be tenable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

I have the honor to be, colonel, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant Colonel R. R. TOWNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

I have the honor to report that nothing of interest occurred in my front to-day. The enemy was quite busy with his artillery to-day, doing us

but little damage, considering the amount of firing done. My command occupied the new line this morning one hour before daylight, keeping one regiment in reserve, which occupies that portion of the old line on the right of De Gress' battery. A portion of the troops in the line were occupied in trimming up and strengthening the work, and to-night will complete it, extending and throwing forward my right to connect more perfectly with General Woods' division and cover a ravine.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
