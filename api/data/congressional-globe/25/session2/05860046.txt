ca-ted within, the bordéis of my district, noi any
other corporation, arrogating to itself exclusive
privileges, and coi rupting the minds oí the people
with its baneful influence
Nevertheless I am not one oí those who aie op
posed to all corporations 1 would not mdisciimi-
naiely oppose their creation, not would I wage a
wai of extermination agamsi them aftei the} aie
brought into existence Whether then ciealion
has been expedient or inexpedient, \v\ ether the re-
sult of good ot bad po'icy, they should, neveithe-
less be protected in the propei exerci c oí their
legitimate powers But their abuses should be Co i
lected, and their eeils and defects guarded against
in the cieahon ol otheis A full and complete su-
pers isory contio! over them should never be lost
sight oí in then creation
1 now beg leaie to lecui to the coimclion e\
pressed by me in the outset, that nothing else than
a general reform in the present banking sjstem of
he United Slates can save the country from the
itequent recuirence of the same pecim aiy emoar-
lassments which have heretofore so often afflicted
it By a reiorm m the 1 anking system, I am \ eiy
Jar from meaning its annihilation The benefits
ol a well regulated credit system, as the legitimate
offspring of fair trade, must be obvious to all con-
versant with the condition oí opr •« idelj extended
and great commercial country A «table and
sound cunency is necessary to the health and
vigor aBd uselulness of the credit system This
can ntver be attained undei the auspices oí the
present banking system of the United ¿tales One
of two alternatives must follow Either we must
hereafter continue to be afflicted with the same
currency evils to which the country has heieto ore
been subjected, or else we must set abjut a leform
of the currencj, by placing it on abettei basis than
now supports, it This improvement might, no
doubt, be effected by various means, the adoption
of any one of \v iich would accomplish the object
desired One means of improvement, which I will
suggest, w ould be the establishment of all banks,
in future upon State capital alone, and a deteimi-
natton on the part of the Slates te cieale no moie
private or individial corporations for ranking pur-
poses A diseased • Ue of ciurenoy is chiefly the
ícsult of over banking This is pr mpted by
individual niteiesl, an Jiordinate do no on the
part of bank stockho'deis to pi out by their bank
ciedits. A system which commits the currency ol
the counlry to the cue it specul uing capitalists,
and then shields tl em fiom individual responsi-
bility, is monstious By establishing banks in fu-
ture upon State capital exclusnely, these evils
wov Id be avoided The banks would then belong
to the people, and the faith of the respect ve Slates
would be pledged foi the redemption if then pipei
Public confidence in their paper would always be
sustained The bank profits paid by the people as
a tax upon their currency inste id of being applied
to enrich individua! stocknoklers would b  placed
in the treasuries of the respective Statns and re-
lieve the people, to a great ex ent from d reel taxa-
tion And, sir, it a national bank \i ic to be or-
ganized by Gongre s I should greatlv prefei it to
be based principal1} upon a due pre portion of the
capital of uhe respective State  I believe that a
safe and useful instill tion of that character could
be organized, and I find I am not singular in that
belief But I canrot now go into this subject In
support of the mam point, I beg leat e to read an
extract from a very ab e report of a committee ot
the Mar} land Legis ature 'rt'ative to the esta-
blishment of a State bank and a n itional euiren-
cy " The committee, in giving their opinion, al-
lude to a stiong and well written article in the
Quarterly Review as «astaimng the ccnciusion to
which they ainvc This repoit seems tr have
had an extensive circulation, and to ha\e been
much considered by the public For the present
use of it I am indebted to Mr L D Teicflí- of
Maryland, who has transmi ted a memorial to this
House embracing this report, and much valuable
information on the subject of banking, for which J
return him my thanks-    The extract is as follows
" The propriety of improving the principle of
banking, for the common benefit of the whole
country, has extensively engaged the public atten-
tion in England, and among the number of valua-
ble essajs which have appeared m the discussion
ol that topic, an article from the pen oí an emi-
nent writer in the duarteily Review is most con-
spicuous "
In the prosecution of the subject, he speaks of
the injurious operation of the present banking sys
tern in England, which is mainly that which pro-
duces a similar influence in the United Slates, upon
the mteiesf of land and laboi, and of its tendency
to accumulate the mass of circulating medium m
the cities, in. contiadistmclton with a public bank
with branches in the different paits of the country,
as follows
" Hence the productive classes, and more espe-
c ally the clash engaged in agriculture, can no
longer command that accommodation which they
had been accustomed to receive The opeiations
oí productive industry are thus impeded by the
withdrawal of that capital which used to ieed
them To this cause must also be ascribed the
glut of money in the city market, which has ren-
deied it extremely difficult to employ it to advantage,
and has consequently reduced very greatly the rate
of mteiest in the city, while money is scarce and
deal in the country
" We consider it, then, as quite evident, that the
owners of money are to the full as much interested
as the owners of land and the owners of labor, in
resisting exclusive privileges, which prevent or im-
pede the formation of safe establishments for
granting loans foi the benefit of the State Such
institutions would instantly infuse new vigor into
the irdustiy of the nation, animate the drooping
eneigiesoi those w ho are engaged in the cultiva-
tion of the soil, and open a wide field foi ihe profit-
able employment of the capital of the country, and
by giving a new direction as well as a new impulse
to industry, establishments of this nature would
also prove the means ol augmenting the national
revenues Increased productiveness would neces-
sarily be followed by an increased consumption of
commodities, this would open a new source of re-
venue lo the State An inoiev-c of revenue thus
obtained would enable the Treasury to bring into
action Ihe latent resources of the country, and to
promote the general prosperity
"It would thus appear that there is no class,
and, with the solitary exception of the proprietors
of bank stock, there is no individual, who would
not be benefited either dneclly oi indirectly, by the
introduction and discreet extension of the great
principle m question Such institutions would
cause the prostiate and despairing and oppressed
classes to be once more visited by the encourage-
ment of hope, the industrious and frugal they
would piesent with at lest an oppoitunity of
emancipating themsehes from the thialdom and
misery into which they have sunk to the owners
oí cap tal, laid out in land or in other investments
they would be found the source of an improved
revenue, and, finally, by multiplying the pioducts
ot tndustn they would yield an additional revenue
to the State
"it is understood that the odium excited by the
inordinate privileges of the moneyed community
largelj contributed to the reform in England, and
to a similar cause reny be traced the French revo-
lutnn, as the exemption from taxation enjoyed by
the privileged orders of Franc was, in effect, and
actual substance, the same as a cession here of a
sovereign light to a 'favored few' to tax the many
tor their >pecial and exclusive benefit ^.nd the
privilege 1 orders of corporators, in contemplation
of this view, constitute the moneyed aristocracy, or
idle and luxurious, who consume the fruits of the
laboring classes, without conttibutmg to their pro-
duction ind this brings us to the original propo-
sition and to the conclusion that, if banks be ne-
cessa y for the convenience of commerce, and the
support oí mdustrv, let them belong to the States,
and let the revenues derived from the voluntary
c mtributions of the borrowers, be justly distributed
for the common benefit of a'l the people The
committee, m support of their opinion, refer par-
ticularly, as the strongest case in point, to the Bank
of the State of South Carolina, which is founded on
the pnncipie proposed, and which, through a suc-
cessful course of twenty years, has more than rea-
lized the expectations ef its projectors "
In support of the conclusions of the eommittse,
they submitted with their report various extracts
from letters of distinguished statesmen, from which
I have selected the following, being only such as
relate to the Bank of South Carolina
From the late Governor   of Soutlt Carolina,   now a
Senator in Congress
"Washington, Feb 11, 1832.
"DiuÁü Sir I received your esteemed letter, to-
gether with jour report upon the subject of a State
Bank in Maryland The scheme proposed con-
forms very much with the character of om bank,
from which we have deuved large annual profits
since its establishment, nearly twenty years ago,
and the whole fiscal concerns of our State are
passed through the public bank, which belongs to
the State exclusively "
"Gov James Hamilton, Jr transmitted the
usual Message to the Legislature of South Carolina,
on the 29th November, congratulating that body
on the abundant productiveness of the State Bank "
From a representative in Congress from S  Carolina
"From authentic information and official docu-
ments, it appears that the success of the State
Bank of South Carolina has been continuous and
uniform throughout a course of neaily twenty
yeais, during which it had to encounter the trying
fluctuations of the money market, which brought
the Bank oí the United States to the very verge of
dissolution, and all the revolutions and vicissi-
tudes of trade and commerce from 18J2 to the
present time, including the disastrous years of
1819, '20, '25, and '26, from which it seems that
the intrinsic merit and solidity of principle have
been the mam pilláis of its support "
In addition to the foregoing extraets, I will add
the following from the present Governor of South
Carolina, who states, in his last Message, that the
"liabilities of the bank  of that State to all others
than their stockholders, amount to $7,77.2,554 85,
their whole assets $19,256,162 78, whole secu-
rity to holders of notes and depositors, including
individual liability of their stockholders to double
the amount of their stock, exclusive of the State
Bank, $34,438,364 78." "To this (is stated in
his message) musf be added the pledge-of the State
for the liabihlies of the Bank of the State of South
Carolina."
It would seem, from the foregoing statements,
that South Carolina has acted with wisdom and
prudence on the subject of banking, and I am
much surprised that more of our States have not
heretofore followed her example
But, sir, if the States will continue to create pri-
vate corporations for banking purposes, let them
reform our banking system, by establishing those
institutions upon principles different from those on
which they are now based Let the corporators
be placed upon the same footing, and be made re-
sponsible in the same manner to the community as
copartners engaged in other pursuits If a com-
pany of individuals associate themselves together
as merchants, each and all of them are liable for
the debts of the concern The law makes each
partner responsible for the debts and liabilities in-
curred by the firm There is no reason why a
company of bankers should be individually ex-
empted from this responsibility Banking, like the
vending of merchandise, is but a trade, a business,
carried on for the purposes oí profit, and a single
bank may do more injury to the community than
could be done by fifty merchants Stockholders
should, therefore, be individually responsible lor
the liabilities of the institution, at least to double
or triple the amount ot their stock subscribed If,
m addition to this, they were prohibited from com-
mencing banking operations until three-fourths of
the stock subscribed shall have been actually and
availably paid in, their issues not allowed to exceed
the amount of specie on hand beyond a reasonable
proportion, their dividends and profits limited to a
eeitai" per cen*. beyond which the stockholders
should in no event be allowed to receive any thing;
and the directors excluded from all stock or bank-
ing accommodations, the community would have
some security against imposition, and ihe eau^a««r
