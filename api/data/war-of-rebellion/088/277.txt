HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General AYRES,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: If you have any rebel prisoners in your custody the major-general commanding desires that they be sent to the corps provost-marshall at these headquarters to-night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-8 p. m.

General AYRES:

I have orders approving what has been done this evening, and telling me to feel the enemy closely and hold on. I learn that your changes this evening leave but a battalion of Bragg's brigade on the line. If in the morning at daylight you can replace this by the Twelfth Regulars I can use this brigade to re-enforce Crawford, which I desire to do . He has pushed his right up to within sight of the Petersburg defenses, and can connect with the picket of the Ninth Corps in only an interval of half a mile. Have your men slash timber in their front to-night.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,August 18, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I can dispense entirely with Bragg's brigade. I have ordered entrenching and slashing. I don't doubt of my ability to hold my front in the morning. I have ordered a deep cut across the railroad and the wagon road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General.

FRIEND'S, [August] 18, 1864-3.10 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: The enemy are pushing me on my right. I can hold them, I think, although that flank is not covered. I have ordered Cutler to deploy to the right and strike his left flank. It is all woods, but a report has just reached me that the enemy is moving to my right; hence the order to Cutler. I am well deployed to the right for observation.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

P. S. -Colonel Carle reports that the enemy are feeling our right, and a prisoner reports A. P. Hill's corps.
