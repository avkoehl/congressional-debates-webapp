Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 14, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: There are no conveniences for loading artillery or wagons here now. All that can be done is to send the infantry down as needed. I think General Birney's division will not be over before 4 o'clock. The artillery and trains cannot cross here; that is, it will take all the time and transportation. There are no boats or barges for horses. General Birney's division commenced embarking at 10.50.
