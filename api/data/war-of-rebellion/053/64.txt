The general commanding directs you to send back to Stevenson all the spare animals of your command. One-third of the artillery horses can safely be sent. Detail a responsible officer with a sufficient number of men to accompany him, and take care of the animals on the way and after their arrival. They should be ready to start by 9 o'clock to-night. Direct the officer in charge to report to these headquarters in person when they are ready to start. All horses in use by clerks will be sent to the rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

have heard considerable work with the pick and chopping; also that they could hear the enemy converse and laugh while apparently measuring for some purpose or other. There has been no felling of trees, but the use of the ax is plainly heard.
