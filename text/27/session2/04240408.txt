from them we must search foi them elsewhere; for there must

What can they bel Clearly to make a currency—to make an
¿sue of paper money to be forced upon the weak «editors at
par, and sold to ihe strong at eighty 01 ninety in the hundred
This stoci will be substituted lor the exchequer bills, and will
rest purely on faith—on public faith—will be bills of credit is-
sued by the Secretary of the Tieasury under a discretionary
authority from Congress The Secretaiy is to prescribe the
form of these new certificates, and will doubtless give them the
form which will answer the purpose—as low as iive dollars—
and payable to bearer, like a bank note. What is the law in
relation to all paper secundes tiansferable by delivery?
The holder is the owner, and has a right to de
mand payment The finder, the robber, the forger,
ere all on a footing m point of ownership, with (he ac
tual purchaser They may demand pay, and payment to them
lagood Not so with paper transferable by endoisementor by
assignment on books Tbeiethettueowner is piotected, and
payment to a finder, a robber or a forgeries invalid It must be
paid over again to _he true owner Assignment on books is a
security against coun'ei feitm", make these stocks transferable
by delivery, and a new field is opened for counterfeiting—afield
whichmustembrdcebothEuiopeand America Books will
have to he kept foi part, for it is only apart of theso certifi
cates which are to pass by delivery, then why not put all on the
books') Why not let the same books show all the debt, and
where it is? Wiiati^ason can there be to make this stock
transferable by delivery—and in what foim the Seeretaiy
please —unless uis io make a curiency of it— a substitute for
for the fifteen millions of exchequer issues? In fact, Mr B
considered itas an attemptto soiuggle a paper money is&ue
through Congiess, and hoped that the clause would be struck
out.
Mr EVAN^I ohserved that this section was in the bill as it
came from t íe Hoti&e He had no idea ihat it gave any such
authority as tie senator iiom Missouri imagines Ic was ut-
terly impossible that such Government stock should become a
paper currency, the 1 r asurynotes never had become a papel
cuuency further than me quality of being redeemable m Go-
vernment dues As to the assertion that no Government stocks
had ever been issued hitherto m such form, he did not know
•whether that was the fact with regard to this Government, but
he wat. quite ceitaiu such was the form in which all the State
stocks were issued It is not imperative that the stock shall
be made in this foim but th&tn may when it is desired by the
money lender upon negotiation with the Secretary of the Trea-
sury He pointed out the convenience of this foim of stock to
theholdeis and seller*, the only thing of consequence to the
Government being that it shall be ready to pay the interest on
the certificate of interest when presented by the holder. The
stock may be consideied of mote value on account of this fací
lity; and the only view of introducing this clause was to ar-
commodate the bidilera foi i he loan lie insisted that the stock
was to rest, dollar foi dollar on the loan itself, and could not
be convtsted into a papei cuntney
Mr WRIGHT remarked that he had very li tie more to say
than he had said die idy He desired meiely ft leply to some
observations of the honorable ohatiman of the Finance Com
raittee, and first as regards the tranefer of these Government
certificates He bel eved the uistom had been introduced into
some of the States, and had been adopted by some banking in-
stitutions, of transferung their stocksm timode wbicn was de
scribed by someFtench word which he did not remember, but
he really hoped that in this country the time had gone by when
a necessity for following such a practice existed A
few years a_>o tilings weie going on too rapidly to
peimit of leguUi ti instéis even of the titles of real
estate, assignments v\ue used which could be tiansfcr
red from hand to hand Hut heie they were about to

Convenience of hivin<* the scrip tiansfeiable from hand to

ingupon them, tbty must setoff this olhei convenience, winch
had been felt by the Sttteof ?ícw Yolk, to a considerable ex

ment papel, and dwln* to sell one hilf to his ft lend, he must
mus1 have a duplícale *et of the leiufirates issued from the
Treasury Department He believed that any other plan would
have been pleferable to this kite tail plan of attaching the
ceitificates And again, ¡n the operation of this system, if there
■were hazard, as he always supposed there was of the paper
being counterfeited, you Incur all the dangei of having your
certificates counterfeited You send out ©11,000,000 at six per

twenty per cent more than the original loan, "and you of-
fei by far a falter field to couoteifeiterslhanis offered by the

strike out that pioviaion which authouzes the transfer 01 these

The question was then pu! on ordenng the bill to be engross
*d for the thud reading, when
Mr.SMJTHofConnecti-utobtained the floor, and addressed
the Senate for nearly two hours, in a speech of much potm    j
H* considered this strictly a party question.   It was one on jj
which the two great parties of the country stood divided He
should take that view of it which he lully believed the gieat
mass of the people entertained with regard to Whig measures
He was glad to see this country had a Government in the at-
mosphere of which two great parties could breathe and live. It
was enough for him to know that ihe party to which he belonged
claimed all those privileges which formed the elements of the
freedom and equality guarantied by the Constitution. He was
ready to admit that the opposite party were as sincere in their
views and meant as well, but there was a great difference be
tween meaning well and doing well, and it was because he felt
satisfied they weie doing wiong in tins measure that he op-
posed it They had denied that they weie the old Fedei al party,
but he and hisfnendscontended they were, and the proof of it
was in the pursuit of the same policy and the same measures as
the old Federal party—a policy calculated toiundown and rum
the countrv Did not the same Federal party duplicate a laige
national debt and high tariff? And is not the same policy the
policy of the present Whig pailyi For what pul poseí To
sustain then selves ind their system The Government is to be
encumbered with a debt created on such teimsas toenab'ethe
authors of it to glow rich at the expense of the country, and
with the riches thub acquired, tbeir party is to be kept in power
What have they done to redeem the promises made by them
to obtain power? Aie they not bound to íedeem those pro
mises? But what d sposiuon do they show that they will fulfil
any one of them? When they were out of power they accused
the late Administration of gross and flagitious#tiavagance—
even descending to the chaige of the Execute indulging m
luxunous fuini ure at the White Heuse, but within the
veiy first month after coming into power, as if to
falsify then own assertions they spend upwaJds of$6000 on
new furnittue foi the White House, on the pretext that it was
not furnished decently enough for the habitation of the Chief
Magistrate They came in by means of such monstious false
hoods and lies, ano weie the first themselves to prove that their
assertions were a I of tint i haracter He read extracts irom
vanous documents in proof of his charges of falsehood and de-
ception He a'so referred to their haste to make extravagant
appropriations, suchas the grantof ®25000to a widow, [Mrs
Harrison J worth at the time $100,000, under the pretext that
more than the grant was due to the family foi expendituies m
the Presidential canvass, and taking chaige of the Government
He also enumerated vauous other appropriations which
he considered could have no other real object in view but that
mainly of building up a national debt, to enable the party to
operate for its own purposes through loan bills, banks, high
tariff, and other measures, converting the coun'rv into a tribu-
tary possession to be used solely for party purposes What
further evidence was wanted of the ultenor object of this
system, than the mvt ation held out m this bill to the money
power at home and abroad to coalesce with the paity admims
termg the Govei nment, and as an inducement, ihey are offered
the gtockat their ownpnee It is contendetl that there was a
debt entailed on them by the late Administration, but if that was
so, they had promised to coirect the abuses of their predeces
sors, and why did they not immediately retrench and pay
off that debt? Instead of doing this, they set about m
creasing the debt, till, in thirteen months, they had added
sixteen millions to it, and now they want to add five more It
will not do for then to shift the responsibility from themselves,
and throw it on theirown President The plea cf their having
been he'rayed will not be admitted by the countiy They had
Mi Tylei 's repeated declarations throughout his public life, on
those subjects which they now accuse him of having be
trayed them upon To show how unavailing this plea was
he read horn seveial speeches and documents the opinions of
the present Piesident, previoi s to his election asVice Piesidcut
He next advei'ed to the ohaige made by the Whig paity
a'amst the paity to which he belonged, that it was thp war of
the Democracy agimst chartered rights, which had broug t
the countrv into disciedit, and he asked what constitution !
vesteil lights coultl cnrpoiations possess, but those granted by
the people, and as the people nevci had delegated their sove
reign powei to charter corporations, what other course
could the D< itinera ic paity honorably take, but that
of waning against an uniust assumption of the right
hy Congress! But if the power did not exist in
Congress to annul vested rights how could theWhigparty
instifv itself on its own grounds foi having passed a bankrupt
law to annul al! vessel rights of creditors against their will?
On this point Mr S dwelt for some time, snowing the incon-
sistency ot theconductof those who forced through the bank-
rupt law, contrasting that conduct with their doctrine of the m
violahility of vested lights But the Democratic party is ar-
raigned befoie the world foi denying the country the creation
of a corporation, such as the late Bank of the United States
which squai dered away a capital of thirty five millions of
dollars, and depuved so many widows and orphans of their
only means of subsistence, not to mention the luin
which it brought u\Mn on other individuals as well as
banking institutions and State credits Thus the effects of
Federal institutions and policy—existing mthe discredit of the
Government and genera! derangement of the whole country-
are raked up and pin led as the effects of Democratic opposi
lion to incorporated lights' These worthy and innocent bank
corporations which have spreadsu-h universal rum, which have
swept away four bundled million dollars worth of property be
Inngine to the people, which have, hy their delusions ard
iniquities dnven upwards of fifty of the Whigs themselves to
commit suicide erenow heldupas the mnocentandmaitvred
sufferers under the persecution of the Democratic party leam-t
charteml riehts' And this is now urged as the reason why the
countiy is embanassed, and why the party in power stands ex
cused foi the state of things \vhieh exi ts These are the nre
texts for creating a debt, the end of which no man can see He
did not ac v-t the geitlemen of dishonesty in this, on the con
trary, he believed they were sinreiely honest in the pursuit of
the policy of protecting the manufacturers by a high tanfr en
foicedby tnational debt, which they exhibit such unweanel
z^al m creating
But this ,s not the only way in which the Whig system is
carried out They have placed high in office a man who com
nutted treason on the country, by earrymg, at the point of thp
bayonet, false returns of election in Pennsylvania Another
valuable man pressed into the Whig service was John W
Bear, the celebrated blacksmith He would read from the
Ohio Statesman some account of this valuab'e officer for
whose accommodation a very honest Democrat was turned oit
to make room Mr S read the paragraph to which he had
alluded.   He also read from the Cincinnati Enquirer g eketeh
of J W Bear. He had lead these matters to show
the instruments and means lesorted to to hurl from
cower the Democratic pai ty, which, after years of depressu n,
occasiored by Federal bank ins itimons, left but a debt of
$5 600 000, but winch was mcieased by their leform succes-
sors seventeen millions in one year It was easy to see that
the gieat and the only crime of the Democratic party was op-
position to the darling and all ruling principle o Whig policy,
tocieate a national debt as the foundation of a high tariff and
protective system. It is pait of this policy to effet this loan at
less than par, that the debt may be the larger, and hence
all oniiusitiOD to it is characterised as factious opposition.
What is it but a proposition to throw the Government into
the ham's of stockjobbers, money dealers and shavers, with an
invitation to augment the debt as much as they please, to gra-
tify tht it own cupidity, and bring about a high tariffi Although
Drofli ate as they have been m their expendituies, yet as the
Government wants this loan, ifthey would but send their bonds
into market in uiopei foim, he would vote for their loan bill
The question was then taken, and the tall was ordered lo be
engiossed for a third leading
