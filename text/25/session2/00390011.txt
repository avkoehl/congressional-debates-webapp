an enhanced price, the new tax imposed on that
class alone, ^o account of iheir bread, would
exceed $50,000,000.
This .addition to their burdens was nearly seven
dollars per h¡ead; and when foi tins no remunera-
tion was made to many persons, as there was only
to some, by higher pnces obtained for their labors
and merchandise exchanged, the increase alone
■was four times as much as the average tax imposed
by means of all the great duties on foreign mer-
chandise. On the present occasion, the undersign-
ed would forbear from entering further into the
consideration of various other matters connected
with this interesting subjeet. But when the influ-
ence of it upon different portions of the country is
traced into some of its numerous bearings and
carefully weighed, new topics of inquiry are pre-
sented, which wilt be found to have an intimate
connection not only with the value of some of our
staple exports, but in other respecte with the vital
prosperity of large portions of the Union.
5. Further explanations as to the Revenue and Expetí-
dituresfor 1837, and the effect upon them by laws
passed at the late special session.
It may be interesting to Congress to have a few
more details concerning the receipts and expendi-
tures of the current year.
The receipts within it have been diminished by
recent legislation over four millions. Had the du-
ties not been postponed, the revenue from all sour-
ces, after deducting the expenses of collection and
othei charges, usually imposed on it, would not, in
the aggregate, have differed materially from the es-
timates formed by the Department m December
last
The receipts, during the current half of the year,
have also thus far corresponded with the views
presented by it at the late session, except that (he
postponement of duties, subsequently authorized
by Congress, has not been so uniformly accepted
as was anticipated, and a portion of the current ex-
penses of collection, including debentures and boun-
ties, has under a new law, been paid from the Trca-
suiy, instead of being deducted as formerly from
the accruing revenue, before it goes into the Tiea-
sury.
It should also be explained, that the estimates of
receipts for any particular quarter or year, though
made accurately, will often vary from ihe subse-
quent official statements; because the money is not
earned by warrant upon the book* of the Registti,
till aflei it is placed in some public depositoiy, or
actually paid out by the collet tmg oiheeron special
drafts.
In ordinal y times the results would not be much
changed by this on cuinsiance. But during fluctu-
ations, such as have characterised the last two 01
three yeats, the difference caused by it may occ i-
sionally extend to some million, Thm 1 imc sums
will be tcchn cally earned into the Treasury m the
last quarter oí 1837, and stand on the b )o! s oied-
ited to that quarter, when, m fact, the money was
collected, and «ubjectto the orders of the Treasurei,
in the first half of the year.
The expenditures have not yet essentially varied
from the amount anticipated m Scp'pmler In ol-
der to defiay them it was theu supposed to be ne-
cessary, undei the existing laws and liabilities, to
postpone the fourth instalment of deposites with the
States, or adopt some other auxiliary mcasuie Ex-
perience since has confnmed the opinion that, un-
der those laws, it could not have been placed m the
custody of the States, except in funds and in a
mannci very inconvenient, as well as with conse-
quences requning an immediate rccal of other de-
posites with the ¿States, which would have been ex-
ceedingly embarrassing to the finances ol both them
and the General Government
The postponement of that instilment, thereloie,
afforded great relief to all concerned, and ielr the
resources of thp Treasury entirely at lilx r!y to bo
applied m the necessaiv discharge of the appropri-
ations made by Congress.
Those resources would have been suftcien* for
that purpose, h?d no luither legislation taken place
But the delay which was afterwards granted be-
yond the year for the payment of almost all fhe
dufies, and the still longer delay which was proffer-
ed te ths ft mer áepoSíte bank , and accepted by
several of them, for the adjustment of what they
owed to the United States, gave rise 'o the n°cessilv
for a temporary issue of Treasury notes The
Department,with the aid of them and its remaining
resources, has, notwithstanding those indulgences
to the public debtors, been enabled to meet the
great demands upon it with punctuality, and in a
manner which, considering the severe eribarias?-
ments of the times, is believed to have generally
proved satisfactory
It now appears probable that, during the next
year, means will be possessed, without any perma-
nent loans, leeall of former deposites, or inciease
of taxes, sufficient to redeem seasonably the Trea-
sury notes that become payable, as well as to meet
all the oidinary appropriations.
Some difficulties have arisen in the construction
of the laws granting further delay to the merchants
and the former deposite banks, but they have thus
far been enforced under a liberal view of their ob-
ject, and m this manner are supposed to have
affoided sensible relief, not only to those immedi-
ately mteiested, but, through them, to the people at
large.
In respect to the act for settling with the banks,
some of them since September have paid ovei all
the public money which then stood to the cted.t of
the Treasurer Others are supposed to have exe-
cuted bonds accorthngto one of its provisions, and
several are preparing" to do so with a view to re-
ceive further indulgence. The remainder aie ex-
pected to discharge, without suit or bond, the
amounts they respectively owe, as may, fro n time
to time, be uecdect to meet the public exigencies
The payments winch will probably be longest
postponed, will chiefly be from some institution'
situated in the West and Southwest. The accu
mulation happening to be there, not by transfer
Irom otlif>r quaiUns, but by receipts on the spot
from the sales of public land, it was unavoidable
undu ihf existing 1 uvs JNfor could it, dunng the
excessive o\cr-aclionsol the times in banking a d
speculations of all kinds, have been lessened anj
furthei than was attempted by issuing the specie
circular—and by icfjainmg to offer any new tracts
at public sale, unle s laws had been passed, as was
recommended, to restrict the sales (o actual setlleis,
oi, as smce proposed, to authori7C the íeceipt ol

But a suitable portion ol the money, af'et being

fn the execution ol the other piominent measiiie
adopted .it the last session, which permuted an
issue of Tieasurv notes, the Department has not
5 et been lequired by the public exigencies to make
a large one
Nor is an/ occasion to keep out a gieat amount
of these notes anticipated. Entertaining such opi-
nions concerning the currency as have been ioi-
merly expressed by the undersigned, any eveiu
would be greatly deprecated ninth should lead to
a permanent emission of such notes, or any kind of
Govern nentpapel, except foi temporary purposes,
and in small amounts, unlcs it be founded en-
tirely on specie, and redeemable under circum-
stances similar to thos,e explained at ths last
sesswn.
The range of the financial operations of the pre-
sent vear fias been very extensive. If the receipts
from postages, from the sa!e.> of the Chickasaw
lands, fiom foreign indemnities, and all other
trusts, were included in the condensed statement ol
the finances, Ihe entire amount earned into the
Treasury during the year, with the balance on the
1st of January last, would exceed $79,000,090.
But without entering here mío emanations m de-
tail under those heads, it will appeal, in the appro-
pnate repoits, that so far as connected w ith this
department, an attempt has been made to conduct
the whole in as close confoimity as possible to the
acts of Congiess Notwithstanding the unusual
magmlule and difficulties of the duties devolved
upon the Tteasury Depaitment during the yeai,
it has scrupulously endeavored not to assume any
doubtful power". Nor, as amere Executive branch
of the Government, has it felt justified, under cir-
cumstances or rea°ons however plausible, to per-
mit the public funds to be employed otherwise
than on objects and in a mannei tint appeared to
be clearly warranted by Ihe limitations of the laws,
and those punciplrs strictly applicable to mere
financial ope rati ons.
(i Explanatory lemarks   on  Ihe chínales of receipts
and expenditw es for 1838
The recipts fiom duties during the n xt jeai
have been estimated quMe four roil'ions higher, m
conscaueace of tin recent act of Congress, bringing
within n the payment oi a still lais;er amount,
which oiigina'ly fell due in the present year.
Independent of that cucumslanoe, it is not con-
sideied prob ible, that tney would much exceed
§13,500,0(10 The reasons for this opinion are,
that a further reduction of two-tenths of the pre-
sent duties winch remain at arate of more than
twenty pel cent, takes efiect afiei the 31st instant,
and that the depression of tiade during the last
half of the year has been severe, and is likely to
continue so for ¿orne lime. The actual imports
during the quarter ending in Septembei having
been only at the rate oi about ninety millions an-
nually, and the average impoits fiom 18"34 to
1830, betoie the commencement of the lite oves-
s>s, having been about eighty two millions, it i«

exceed foity per cent, on that average, oi about

tion that ono-ha'f of them will be fr e, and the
