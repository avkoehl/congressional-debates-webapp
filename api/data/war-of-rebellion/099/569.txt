which is in possession of our mounted infantry. My orderliest left with dispatches to that effect some time ago. General smith had a skirmish with the enemy's cavalry on the Roberts road, killing and wounding about ten of their men.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have, in accordance with instructions, place a brigade at Tiller's Bridge, also have sent two regiments to Kelly's Bridge. I have thought best to do so, as the bridge (Kelly's) is in our hands, is in serviceable condition, and would be available for use should it be thought advisable to send a column across there, using the system of parallel roads south of the main Cheraw road. In a note, just received, you allude to an order to push a brigade to McCaskill's. No such order has been received, and by referring to the map, as it would be sending troops to the rear some three or more miles, I presume the order may have been given to some troops behind that position. Be pleased to reply if it is still expected for me to send troops to McCaskill's.

I am, respectfully,

W. P. HAZEN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,February 25, 1865.

Major-General HAZEN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: As you have not yet received my note requesting you to place a brigade at McCaskill's Cross-Roads I presume my orderly has been captured. The enemy has quite a force of cavalry in our neighborhood, and we have lost some foragers and two headquarters orderlies. The general wants a brigade from either the Second or Fourth Division placed imposition at McCaskill's, as indicated in my note.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,West's Cross-Roads, C. S., February 25, 1865.

[Major General WILLIAM B. HAZEN,

Commanding Second Division, Fifteen Army Corps:]

GENERAL: Major Burkhardt reports that the bridge over Lynch's Creek, on the Camden and Cheraw road, near Tillersville Post-Office, is in his possession, and in good order. Please push your advanced brigade to the bridge, with instructions to hold the same, as this corps may cross at that point. It would be well for them to intrench.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
