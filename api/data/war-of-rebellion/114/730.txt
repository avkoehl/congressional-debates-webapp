[Inclosure.]
BALTIMORE, January 16, 1862.

Honorable CHARLES B. CALVERT.

DEAR SIR: I take the liberty of addressing you in behalf of E. G. Kilbourn, esq., confined since early in September last if I am not mistaken as a political prisoner and now at Fort Warren, Boston Harbor. He was a member of the late house of delegates of Maryland. His wife, a very interesting woman, is very sick, indeed I may say she is ill and may never see her husband again unless he is shortly released. His business affairs are going to the dogs and as far as I can see or imagine there can be no reason for keeping him longer. Will you do me as well as Mrs. K. the favor to ask for his release at least for thirty days he giving his parole to return at the expiration of that time? This would be an act of real humanity and I hope you will see Mr. Seward and obtain an order for his release as above.

I am, &amp;c., very truly and respectfully, yours, &c.,

WM. B. BOND.
HEADQUARTERS,Baltimore, January 18, 1862.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant relating to Robert M. Denison, a prisoner at Fort Warren, and recommend that he be released on his parole for thirty days.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
