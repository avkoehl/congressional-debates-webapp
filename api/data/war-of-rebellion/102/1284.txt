HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., April 21, 1865.

SOLDIERS OF THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI ARMY:

The crisis of our revolution is at hand. Great disasters have overtaken us. The Army of Northern Virginia and our Commander-in-Chief are prisoners of war. With You rests the hopes of our nation, and upon Your action depends the fate of our people. I appeal to You in the name of the cause You have so heroically maintained-in the name of Your firesides and families so dear to You-in the name of Your bleeding country, whose future is in Your hands. Show that You are worthy of Your position in history. Prove to the world that Your hearts have not failed in the hour of disaster, and that at the last moment You will sustain the holy cause which has been so gloriously battled for by Your brethren east of the Mississippi.

You possess the means of long-resisting invasion. You have hopes of succor from abroad-protract the struggle and You will surely receive the aid of nations who already deeply sympathize with You.

Stand by Your colors-maintain Your discipline. The great resources of this department, its vast extent, the numbers, the discipline, and the efficiency of the army, will secure to our country terms that a proud people can with honor accept, and may, under the Providence of God, be the means of checking the triumph of our enemy and of securing the final success of our cause.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.
