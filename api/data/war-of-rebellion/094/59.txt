NASHVILLE, TENN., December 5, 1864 - 11 p. m.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have received your dispatch of this date. While I fully approve the correctness of the rule stated by Lieutenant-General Grant, I am certain the best I can do for the present is to retain General Stoneman in his present command. He was assigned after consultation with General Sherman, and with his approval. I will therefore avail myself of the authority contained in your dispatch to do so. General Stoneman is now in East Tennessee, preparing to carry out General Grant's instructions. If the general can send there an officer in whom he has more confidence, I shall be much gratified to have him do so.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just arrived with my command all safe, with a loss of only two wagons. The feet of my men are very sore, many of them barefoot. I was within eight miles of nashville on the night of the 2nd instant, and found, by information received from prisoners, that the way was not open, so, without orders, I returned to this place, and now await further orders.

Respectfully,

J. A. COOPER,

Brigadier-General.
