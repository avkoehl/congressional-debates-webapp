Honorable EDWIN M. STANTION, Secretary of War:

Four days ago all troops that could be spared from other points were concentrated in this valley in consequence of the existing alarm among the people, and the earnest exhortation of Governor Curtin, who informed me that a raid at this time would be very disastrous to the country. Of this I will communicate by letter. Possibly the half company of cavalry ordered from Columbia County might return. some days ago I informed General Halleck that cavalry was absolutely necessary in this State for the good of the country.
