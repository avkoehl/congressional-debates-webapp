(Received 2.15 p. m.)

General W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The general desires you to resist the crossing of the east fork of the Utoy Creek; it is important to hold it.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

AUGUST 4, 1864-1.20 p. m.

General JACKSON,

Commanding, &c.:

Please issue imperative orders to your command to gather together all captured horses, and hold them ready to be turned over. It is of the last importance that they shall not be scattered and lost.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

AUGUST 4, 1864-9.40 p. m.

Brigadier-General FERGUSON,

Commanding, &c.:

The general directs me to say that in a short time he will place you permanently under the orders of General Wheeler. For a few days General W. will probably be absent, and, in the mean time, it will be necessary for you to be under the general command of General Jackson. When General W. returns, your affairs can be, it is hoped, satisfactorily arranged.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

AUGUST 4, 1864-9 a. m.

Brigadier General M. J. WRIGHT,

Commanding, &c.:

General Shoup directs me to inform you that you have been assigned to command of post at Macon. He desires that you will lose no time in reporting for duty, as you services are very much needed.

[L. P. DODGE,

Aide-de-Camp.]

MACON, August 4, 1864.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary:

The question of subsisting the Georgia militia is becoming serious and embarrassing. So far none of them have been mustered into the Confederate service, but under the order of local commanders and others subsistence and forage are being issued to all from the time they report at the rendezvous. If the evil increases or is continued much longer our ability to feed the main army in front, with communications so limited, is very questionable.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
