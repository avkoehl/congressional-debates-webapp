General J. B. DOUGLASS,

GENERAL: I had three lively skirmishes with Anderson's band yesterday, south and west of Columbia, thoroughly routing and scattering them. They concentrated in the night near Franklin, fell upon Captain Parke, of the Fourth Missouri State Militia, from Boonville. I am on their track. Particulars by mail.

COMMANDING OFFICER AT LEAVENWORTH:

My informant states that they will be at least 1,000 strong to-morrow, 29th instant. This is probably exaggerated,although several small bands have recently moved in that direction.

Colonel THOMAS MOONLIGHT,

Commanding, Paola, Kans.:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 26th instant came to hand to-day. Allow me to thank you for the valuable information which it contained, and though my troops are so fixed that I cannot at present do much in that direction I intend to move that way with a large force very soon. Your kind offer heartily to co-operate with me along the border is very gratifying to me, and I trust that we may together ward off any serious blow from the enemy. I will forward to you the signal for September as soon as they are received by me.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
