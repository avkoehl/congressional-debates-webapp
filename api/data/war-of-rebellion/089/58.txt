HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 3, 1864-1.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I hear considerable musketry firing and some artillery near here, apparently on Crawford's front. Do you know anything yet, and have you sent the brigade I spoke to you about?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864-2 a. m.

General MEADE:

I believe the firing just heard was not in front of Crawford, but more to the right. It has ceased now, except slight picket-firing. Crawford's is as strong as any part of my line. I have not sent the brigade, and probably shall not be able to.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 3, 1864-11.20 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

The major-general commanding directs that you send a brigade to General Crawford before night, to be used on the line between Fort Wadsworth and Fort Howard.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

I will send Colonel Hofmann's brigade back as soon as I can get arrangements completed to do it.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

In consequence of the information received from signal officers of the movements of enemy's troops, the order to send a brigade to Crawford is suspended.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

P. S.-I did not know until just now you had returned to your headquarters on railroad, hence my telegram to General Crawford.
