difficult to discriminate. The enlisted men distinguished by capturing flags have already received the reward of their valor, and a list has been forwarded of those otherwise particularly remarkable for good conduct.

I desire to mention Colonel Avery, Tenth New York, who has ably commanded his regiment in every action, and rendered most important service in guarding and bringing into camp the prisoners and property captured on the 5th of April; Major Snyder, Tenth New York, temporarily in command of the Twenty-fourth New York, for leading his regiment not only gallantly but in good order in the charge on the enemy's works at Sailor's Creek, April 6; and Captain Craig, First New Jersey, for good conduct in all the actions of the campaign and for valuable service rendered in several reconnaissance he has commanded.

The officers of my staff have rendered most valuable service, and are all deserving of high praise for their courage, zeal, and efficiency.

The reports of casualties have been already rendered.* I annex copy of receipt from Captain Harper, division provost-marshal, of prisoners and property turned over to him from this command:
