CAMP AT ORANGE COURT-HOUSE, September 9, 1863.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President Confederate States, Richmond, Va.:

Mr. PRESIDENT: I have placed the troops on march toward Richmond. Two divisions will reach Hanover Junction this morning. The third will reach or pass beyond Louisa Court-House to-day. General Longstreet proposes that Pickett's divison take the place of Wise's and Jenkins' brigades about Richmond, and that they accompany him. Pickett's division wants many officers, owing to the number wounded and captured, who cannot now be replaced. He also thinks it might increase its ranks in that locality. Wise's and Jenkins' brigades will probably exceed Pickett's division in numbers, though they will not give the Virginia troops you desire for the south. I know no other objection. General Longstreet has selected two Georgia brigades for Charleston, one from McLaws' and one from Hood's division. He does not want to take them into Georgia, for fear of desertion. If he takes Wise's and Jenkins', instead of Pickett's, he will assign them to McLaws and Hood, respectively, in their stead. The division of Pickett, according to the arrangement of the Quartermaster-General, will be moved last. It is on march to Richmond; you can therefore decide. The two Georgia brigades are also directed to march to Richmond, and can be sent to Charleston whenever transportation be furnished.

Your dispatch of yesterday is not very clear in reference to Burnside's movement, but I understand it to mean that it is approaching Rosecrans. I think Rosecrans is maneuvering to cause the evacuation of Chattanooga, and for Burnside to form a junction with him. He ought to be attacked as soon as possible. I think it probable that Gillmore will now seize upon Sullivan's Island, to cause the evacuation of Fort Moultrie, and thus close the entrance to Charleston.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

ORANGE COURT-HOUSE, September 9, 1863.

The PRESIDENT:

Anderson's brigade, of Hood's division, is designated as one of the brigades for Charleston. Please direct accordingly. It will march to Richmond.

R. E. LEE.
