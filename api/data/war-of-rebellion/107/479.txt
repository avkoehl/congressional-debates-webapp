Commanders of divisions, brigades, and regiments are directed to give their personal attention to preparing their commands to take the field. All unnecessary baggage will be disposed of. Transportation will not be furnished for unauthorized articles.

By command of Major-General McClellan:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NOTE.-In the event of a movement the allowance of baggage for officers established by paragraph 1097, Army Regulations (edition of 1861), must in no case be exceeded. It is probably the necessities of the service may require a reduction of that allowance.

HEADQUARTERS KANAWHA BRIGADE,Gauley Bridge, September 13, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Cross-Lanes:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of yesterday reached me an hour ago. I had already started a column of two regiments forward to follow up Wise, who last evening moved from his camp near Hawk's Nest. I shall join the column myself as soon as I get this dispatch startd I suppose Wise has retired to the mouth of Sunday road to cover the retreat and unite with Floyd's column. I think it probable that a partial union of their forces has already been made there. I will watch the opportunity and strike if I get a chance. I will also look after the Saturday and Friday roads (so called), which leave the Sunday road about five miles from the turnpike and come out about five miles this side of the terminus of the Sunday road.

In haste, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
