Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Fessenden.
H. of Reps.
chants. Look at Boston, sir From that city, the wealthiest,
in proportion to its population, m the United States, you have
not one remonstrant Look at New York, at Philadelphia, ana
almost every other great city m the Union From all you
have heard, an 1 in tones that speak loudly, the public sentí
ment upon thibengiossmg subject I grant you, sir, that the
state of things at the present time has produced an unusual
state of feeling upon this matter, and occasioned an unusual
pressure upon the present Congress But it is by no means
true that the voice wo now hear conjes exclusively from
debtors They join m the supplication, indeed, but theyaie
aided by thousandsof those who feel no other necessity than that
which is common to all the utizeis of this wide spread republic
One othei remark, sir, aod I will proceed to the constitu
'tional questions which have been raised and piessed with so
much zeal and such appearance of conviction I wish to ex
press the hope that gentlemen will be satisfied with taking this
bill as it is I am opposed to any and all amendments at the
present time, not that I think the bill free from imperfection",
but because I believe its fate depends uponom not attempting
to tamper with it It has been perfected by some of the greatest
legal minds m this, country It hao passed the ordeal of the
Committees of Judiciary in the two Houses of t ongresa Un
der these circumstances, I am desirous (to borrow a figure of
the gentleman from New Yoik who fiist addiessed the com-
mittee) to bav< the ci aft fairly launched and see how she sits
upon the water Make all (he amendments we may, theiecould
be hule hop*, of perfecting the measure at the present time
Expei lence only can do this And, in my judgment, if we at
tempt to r.at s>iy all gentlemen as to details, we shall be much
moie likely io injuie than to <ud U Let us try it, en, let us u y

Those, sir, who object to thisbiU on constitutional giounds
have endeavored to establish two positions, viz
1   That the woid bankruptcy had, at the time our Constitu
tion was framed, a fixed legal meaning in this country, and that,
therefore, our legislation must be co-extensive and coterminous
with that meaning, going no farther, and falling in no degree
short of it
2   That the Constitution confers no power over existing con
tracts.
I will notice these positions m their order
Definitions have been cited from the law dictionauéS to show,
and I admit that they do show, that, m England, at the time
íeferred to, a bankrupt must be a trader, that is, that the term,
m its legal acceptation, was applicable to no othei class in the
community, using the word trader in a very broad and exten
sive sense Sir, admitting this to be so, does nfollow that in
this sense alone the framersof the Constitution so u-.ed the
word "bankruptcyiJ' Are the words of the Constitution to be
thus restricted! We a 11 know that, m process of time, Ian
guagechanges Words which atone time included one class
af ideasafter a long period to include others Om great char
tei of liberty was made, we hope, for all time None of us con
template the period of its dissolution, oi ofits btcoming obso
lete Mast those whocomeafterus be duvenback to a coi si
delation of what woids are understood to mean in our day, m
order toa correct exposition of that instrument* If so, the day,
I trunk, is not very far distant, in which our lawmakers and
lavvgiveis will find themselves involved a maze ofpeiplex
ltyand confusion Theie are words and powers now, sir, m
th u instrument, which opeiate upon things not existing at the
period when it was adopted Tongress has powei 'to regulate
commerce " But there were no steamboats m those day
Congress has power 1I&0 l to establish postr^ad-- " Railroads
were baldly imagined especially with the locomotive force
whu h now travels ovei them with such speed, when this
power was granted By the same kind of tea oi mg, then,
it would be plainly unconstitutional to sDnd the mill upon
a railroad oi to touch, many manner, that commerce which
is earned on through the agency of steam powei I appre-
hend, '■ir that gentleman are hardly piepired to follow out
and subtam a position which woald lead to such conse
quence^
In following out this idea it it said thit, masm ich as the
woid binkiuptty had this distinct and determined meaning
it the fmem Tngland, we must conform onr legislation t > it
that bankiuptcy is not insolvency, in a legal s nse, ind that,
consequently, we cannot bung within the operation of any ¡aw
cnatttd by us that class of persons who, at thatparticu'ir pe
nod, sveicdeM_nated by the term "insolvent" Sir, if then
gnment is good in tie wSiole, itisgood inMtits pan° And
whithci would it kid u1*? If we must yo foi a definition of
th( tetm binkntptcy" to the English laws as (hey existed
then, we must tike the whole of those law5* The provisions
of our iawsmu&t be i lentical with them 1 hose whom they
considered is traders we must consider so, and none others
We are not at hbeity either to contract or to expind that defi
ninon Weaie boun), and bound foiever, to that piecise point,
md, thouf,!i tiny may \ ny fiomit, we cannot Are geut'e
menpiepated foi ill ¡.he monstrous consequences of such a li
nutation"?
Hut, >fr Chanmari, I have fuither inswers to this position
of the genth men, and which, to my mmd, ire, if possible yet
mort conclusive I contend that words used m the Constitu
tion ire tobe tiken in then gsneial and popular, and not ¡n
their mtiely legil sen&e unles  the intent so to use them is
manifest from the fact of the instrument ISow, if gentlemen
will look into then dictionaties—not then law dictionaries,
cut the most approved dictionmes of the English language—
they wilt fnd tbit the word bankruptcy includes and dii at the
lime lefcired to, and long befoie every cld&s of insolvent debt
ot^ In i ^enenl ind popular sense, th words bankruptcy
ind in-,)fvcncy lie identital in meaning Dr Johnson deftness
i buikinpt to be "a man in debt beyond the power o' pay
ment, ' and barkruptcy "the state of a mdd bankrupt " In^ol
ve ncy is defined as "inability to pay debt<? " Now <=n, wbeie
b (he difference 1 I should be glad to hive my gentleman point
it out Weil, then, bir, when 'he Constitution eives power over
"the subtect of binkiuptcies," ucoveis the whole giound It
includes m us broid sweep evtiy pei3on, of whatever descnp
tion ofwhUe\er business, who owes moie than he can pay
AH all come within the ample folds of this constitutional ?ar
ment Andlrequntsomethmg moie than mere assertion tocon
vmce met hit menhkt those who framed that great m^tiu ment
men who undeistood the meaning ofword^—lawyeis, who were
verged m the le^al enactments of England—did not consider the
ample power they were conferring whf n thev adopted that
clause, and would not have p! iced upon it the limitation con
tended foi, had they intended that any such hmuatn n should
be mide Sn, they intended nothing of thekind They meai t
to give full powei over the subject And th"y have nveri
it m term& that reasonably admito! neuhei doubt nor discus
«ion
But one or two facts, Me Churmin, will demonstrate, be
y< nd all que^t on the fallacy of that argument upon which gen
tlemen so much r I\ One is that the fit t Ens'ish statute of
bmkrur tc>—tint ol ilenn Mil—wis not limited m its opera
tion to persons engafeil in tjade It extended to ail clarees of
pers uis It embrace 1 tradei and auisin, and ill other degrees
ardconditiirio of men without distinction This fact makes ,t
tvi 1 nt that t'ic leal definition, even his not a'wiy been the
same m England And we are therefore compelled tohpliev,
if we i'ipt U e views of gentlemen heie that the fiamers of
um Con u> tion di 1 not last one glan e beyond the penod of
then own icti   th it th^y drew no m tuition from the pas',
but ho mil 1 thf n obenatmn*- by the tate of things then ex
l-tin  i «uppo i im which would b equally disciedttable to
their te ear  i in ' then undeiofanding
O e fact moie sn and I have done with this branch of the
subject II nv vein mia'ithave been in Fi g'and, the term
buikitiptcy" never ha! the! mi ed memme contended for, in
this roim ry At the tune oui Cor=tmuion was framed evt ry
^tite then c\ «ting had a laikrup liw, oi an insolvent

tie i'ii mctive pnnuples of the rngh«h insolvent law
manotlti there might be lound a i insolvent lav operating, to
a eons (--rible extent, like (he English bankrupt hw Were
not the men o  thosedays aware of that state of things'? Un
doubted* hev iv ,s have been, Corning, as they did from
ueai'y ev^yfedtc * h! «>Ci,udin ed wlThtU peculiarlegisldU* n
of each and all And, if they did know these facts, why are we
to conclude that they had refeience only, in acting upon this
subject, to the existing laws of England, and not the laws of
their own country, under which they lived, and with which
they had long been familiar* Sn, the supposition isprepts
teious It is founded only in the imagination, and finds no
suppoit m'he state of facts existing at the time Our anees
tors were too jealous of England, and too little desirous of
binding themselves, or their posterity, to the wheels of her le
gislation, to affoid a presumption of any such intent with re
gard to this subject, or any other
Sir I might read authorities to yon in support of these views,
and authorities, too, which, I am rejoiceá to pay, arerec&ived
with great respect, both in this and other countnes I might
strengthen myself with the great names of Maishat! ard Story
Time, however, will not aliow meto read their opinions I
content myself, therefore, with refemng gentlemen to the opi
mon of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Sturgis vs
Crownmshield, and to Story's Commentaries on the Constitu-
tion They will theie find ibat both the^e distinguished jurists
concede to Congress a power ovei this subject unlimited, save
by the íestnction I have named
The remaining question for consideration, Mr Chairman, is
whether Congiess has power to pass a law affecting the valí
dity of existing contiacts'* And here I must be permitted to
differ fiom the able gentleman who opened this debate ¡.Mr
Barnakd] as to one point I cannot agree with him that a
law wmch destroys or afiects the remedy upon a contract, does
not impan its obigation It does not, to besuie, impan its
moral obligation But the woid "obligation" is not used in the
Constitution m its moral sense ISo legislative action, however
properly exercised, can impair that obligation But, sir, a law
is good foi nothing witl out a sanction A right without a
lemedy is nothing Take away all power to enfoice a contract,
and you destroy i ts obligation in the sense intended by the Con
3 ltution The distinction is too nice sir I haveevei been
unable to see that the right was not impaired when the remedy
existir g at the time was in any d gree weakened And surely
it is all gone for any practical pntposi,—any purpose know n to
the law—when th^ remedy is entirely destroyed
Waiving this, sir, I cannot peiceivehow theargumenf of the
gentleman from l\t w Yoik [Mi Hoosevelt] is to be met or
avoided I íepeat it, not in the hope of giving it additional
force, but dimply with a -new of recalling; it to the minds of
gentlemen How is it to be explained upon the giounds con
tended for that whi'e the Constitution in section 9 provides that
'no bill of attainder or ex post facto law <diall be passed, ' in
the veiy next section it declaies that "no State shall pass ai y
bill of attainder, ex post facto law, oi law impairing the obl'ga
tion of conti acts'*' The fiist provision foim& a limitation upon
the powers of (Jongre e, the second upon ti e btates Why
was not the limitation upon Congress made co extensive with
that upon the States, unless it was intended not to exclude Con
giess fiom the exercise of that pauicular powei"* The fact rf
this omission, when coupled with the express grant of powei
over the subject of bankruptcies, foimsan aigument which, to
my mind ib unanswerable I will not dwell longer upon this
point
I he powei of Government to pass laws affecting the obh-
ga'ion ofconiiactgi&denved fiom the natuie of the Govern-
mentitbelf Guvemme it, ex vi teimim^ implies dominion
overall subjects which miy become propei and necessaiy
subjects of legislation Wo one will pietend that this power is
not possessed by the Briti h Parliament Our Constitution re
cognises its puor exibtenct in the ¡states, by (he very fact of
its inhibition by that instrument It i too, a necessary pow
er, foi it is by no means difficult o imagine a condition of
things in which the safety and well being of the State would
impentively dem ird its pyerci^t Take the caqp, loi exam
pie, m which a whole conmumty becomes insolvent by some
stupendous accident, or by some mdgnificent, but fallacious
scheme, such as othei countries have eeen and ft.lt at no very
distant day Can it be pretended that a pow-r to apply a re
medy to a divider th t ispaialyzing md destroying thebody
politic e\i&th no wheie? Such an idea it. a libel upon the very
narrf of government, Am1 yet, if we hive rot this power, it
exists no whetem this country It is yielded up by the S ates
And the same instiument vthieh thus vieirisit vests it in the
General Government by the t !au e wfich giants, fully, all
powei over "the subject" Tie exception is not made sn,
and wecarnot, we have no right to believe that the omission
could hit been a meie matter of accident It must have
been designed md by that design the intention is clearly de
m^n st rated
lam willing to concede that the Government of the United
States ia peculiar, that it possesses no \ owt-r not granted ex
pres lv or by necessary implication In this íespect it differs
horn all oihT*, and, so far, my aigument, arising from the
genenl naturt of government does not apply But the exist
ence of the principle when ta'en in connection with the ex
press grdnt ofpoweL on theone hand, and the exclusion of it
on theo her, together with the n^cee-aty ofits being found soma
whme, lendci my conciu ion cieaily unavoidable
It is ti ue, n deed «h that a power like this should be mo3t
cautiously exetci^ed A« ageneril rule, the obligation of con
tractsshou' 1 be held inviehl le Regard should alw lys be bad
to the interest <* ind rights of the citizen But tho=e rights aid
thosemteres's-mu-*t yield to high consideration--of public policy
Thpy rauH neces^at i!y be made subven lent to the good of the
f^ate I giant that no sympathy f r hurmnsuffeiing no desire
to benefit individuals, or classes of individual can alóte de
niand ito exercise I epilation of the kind must he í íunderl up
