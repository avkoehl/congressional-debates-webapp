(Received 10 p. m.)

Secretary STANTON:

The public excitement and uncertainty regarding affairs in Maryland and Virginia is so great that only a dispatch from yourself to General Dix can relieve it. Is there any prospect of receiving one to-night?

W. W. FULTON,

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch of last night is just received. On being advised by you that a call had been made on Governor, Seymour for troops I telegraphed him, asking when it would be filled, advising him that I wanted two regiments-one for this city and one for Elmira-to take the place of the Veteran Reserves, and tendering my services to aid him. To this dispatch no answer has been received. Major-General Sandford informed me yesterday that the Governor had authorized him to send 4,500 from this city immediately, and General Duryea 1,500 from Brooklyn, but that the order had been revoked. This information was confirmed by one of General Sandford's aides at 10 o'clock last evening. There is a very bad state of things here, and I think three regiments of reliable State troops are indispensable to the preservation of order and for the security of the public property.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 9, 1864-12. 30 a. m.

Major-General DIX,

New York:

The troops raised in New York by General Sandford should be hurried forward to Baltimore with all possible dispatch.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Received 12. 20 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am directed by Governor Seymour to send 3,500 men from my division under the President's call. To what place shall I direct them? Will a regiment of 600 light artillerists, dismounted, be available?

C. W. SANDFORD.
