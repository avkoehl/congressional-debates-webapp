Just look at the committees of both branches in
the last Congress, and then cry out "northern
aggression." Of the twenty-two important com-
miiters in the Senate, the slave States had the
chairman upon sixteen, and the free States six.
And of the twenty-five important committees of
the House, the South had the chairman upon ser-
enteen, and the North eight. Thirteen million
free whites in the North arc represented at the
head of/o-urfem standing committees in Congress,
while six million in the South are represented at
the head of thirty-three standing committees. This
packing operation on committees to favorthc South
was no new thing m the Thirty-Fifth Congress:
they have ahvays had it in just that kind of a way.
Such noithern aggiession ! It should be borne in
mind that these committees shape the whole legislation
of the country.
Again; look at the Senate committees of this
Congress; out of twenty-two committees, the
South have the chairman upon sixteen and the
North on six; and upon every single one of the
fourteen important committees, the slave States
have all the chairmen. Of the eighteen free States
represented m the Senate, fourteen arc totally dis-
franchised upon the heads of the Senate commit-
tees; while twenty-four Republican Senators, rep-
resenting more than twelve Million, of the people
of the Union, out of one hundred and twenty-five
places on said committees, get only thirty-nine,
and that at the tail-end of every one upon which
they are placed. I call upon the country,North
and South, to look at this beautiful picture of
nationality, equality, Democracy* and a magnani-
mous, generous South. Below is the looking-glass.
Look into it: if you do not "see the elephant"
you cannot fad to see the "negro."

Fourth, f n 1800 the seat of the General Govern-
ment was, by virtue of a previous act of Congress,
removed to the slave territory where it now^Unus.
Washington was then nearly an unbroken wilder-
ness; now it numbers nearly seventy thousand
inhabitants. Noithern votes brought the si at of
Government here; and it has been built up, to a
veiy great extent, by northern treasure. These
splendid ma*si\e piles of marble, which rear their
lofty columns in every direction in this citv, were
built by Government money. Who graded the
beautiful lawns that'stretch themselves out around
these buddings like some panoramic fancy sketch?
Who planted the shade trees that ornament them?
Government money did all this. Yes, sir, the
Federal Treasury has been depleted for the last
sixty years of its millions and tens of millions to
build up this great city upon slave territory. Who
gets the benefits? Principally the slave States.
Washington city furnishes a great market for
southern produce, raised in Virginia and Mary-
land. The Government not only has built this
city, but annually appropriates enormous sums
from the Federal Treasury to support it. It
grades and lights its streets, paves its walks. It
has gone seventeen mdes up the Potomac, and
plundered the national Treasury of about five
| miihon dollars to furnish the city with splendid
water-works. It indirectly feeds and clothes a
large number of its inhabitants. It furnishes their
swaddbng-clothes when first they open their eyes
upon the light of creation, and pays the sexton's
bill when life's fitful scenes are over. The North,
lor their Representatives, in return, get good ho-
tels and boarding places, by paying Washington
prices, subject on iy to occasional annoyances from
some of the peculiar friends of the "peculiar in-
stitution," and " subject also to the Constitution
of the United States."
But I will do no injustice to the good people of
the city of Washington, but will give them an item
of credit which they may file in set-off against my
general allegations. It is this: they gratuitously
furnish an army of patriotic men who arc exceed-
ingly anxious to serve their country, in places of
trust and profit, who will, just as circumstances
require, sing peans to Douglas or Seward, Bo-
cock or Sherman-, always pitching their key-note
to the tune of the "loaves and fishes." And, as
evidence of their patriotism and loyalty to the
Constitution, we have heard many of tln-ir num-
bers, day after day during the sitting of this Con-
gress, vociferously applauding disunion sentiments
uttered upon this door, which, if carried into prac-
tical operation, would rase this magnificent Capi-
tol to the ground a heap of smoldering ruins, light
up their houses with tne torch-light of the incen-
diary, desolate thoir fields, murder their wives and
children m a war of strife, and make this great
city only a fit habitation for the owls and bats.
Having shown that the North has been gen-
erous to the South, and fulfilled all its constitu-
tional obligations to her in letter and in spirit, I ;
I now" desire, in all fairness, to Mtamine the other J
side of this question: and in discharging this part '
of my duty, I sha'd " carry the tear into Africa." J
1. Article one of the amendments to the Con- '
stitution of the United States provides that— !
<c Congrcf* ^hall make no law i expecting.'tn establishment 1
of religion,or piohibitmg the free exercise thereof; or abndg J
itjg tlie iiecdom of s-p^eeh, or of the pies* ; oi the right 6t i
the people peaceably to a^sembic, and to petition the G^o ]
eminent for a iedtess of grievances." * j
I charge that the South has not always in good !
faith lived up to the above provision, inasmuch i
as that section of the Union, for a great number i
of years, by congressional action, aided by north- j
ern Democrats, refused to receive petitions com-
ing from the people of the free States. Gag reso-
lutions, by which the petitions of the people were •
treated with contempt, were from year to year iS
forced through Congress. For years the people !|
^sent up to the Capitol their memorials, and they ;!
were summarily met, and their petitions kicked n
out of doors in both Houses of Congress. For j
a long time this war of the slaveholdmg inteiest i
against the people was waged with fierceness, but .!
at length, through the determined will and persu- j
verance of the " old man eloquent." aided by his j
patriotic compeers, the rights of American citi-
zens were once more restored, and the Constitu-
tion vindicated against those who had rudely
assailed it.
3. The South has undertaken, in carrying out
thnr aggressive policy upon the North, to reverse
the territorial policy of the Government, as estab-
lished by its founders, and concurred in by every
; national'Admuustration for more than half a cen-
i tury.
! I shall not now stop to argue the constitutional
i right of Congress to inhibit slava-v in the Terri-
i tories,for that has been successfully done a thou-
I sand times before, upon the floors of Congress ,|
I and in other places: I have already said mainly
I what i desire to upon that point.
I As we have shown—irom the passage of the
ordinance of 1T87 to the establishment of Oregon
Territory in 1848—the policy of every depart-
ment of the Government was uniform; that Con-
gress had the right under the Constitution to pro-
hibit slavery in the Territories of the United States/
Hence it follows, that the introduction of the
Wilmot proviso was, in no proper sense, an in-
fringement upon southern rights; for it had been
made a great fundamental principle of the Govern-
ment itself. The very converse of this proposi-
tion was true, that the resistance of the South to
the application of this -wholesome rule to the ter-
ritory acquired by the treaty with Mexico, was,
per se, an aggression upon northern rights.
At this juncture of affairs in this country, what
right had the South to step up to the North and
demand a new policy ? What right had the south-
ern States to carry their iocal laws into the Ter-
ritories, to the exclusion of the people of the free
States.
But our southern friends claim what they call
an equal right in the territory of the United States.
But the demand they make does not stop with
an "equal" balancing of the scales. They de-
mand more. They not only ask to carry with
them into the Territories everything which the
common law recognizes as property—everything
as projjerty which the people of the free States
can carry with them; but they demand to carry
and plant upon free territory a system of involun-
tary servitude, which invades the rights of the free
laborer from the North, robs him of his capital,
disgraces him in society, and in the end drives
him away, as 1 shall hereafter show.
If it is said the Constitution, proprio vigore,
establishes slavery in the Territories, I answer,
that is begging the question. We deny it; and
that is the very question now in issue which the
people, and not the Supreme Court of the Unitod
States, have got to settle.
*3. Tlie terms upon which Texas was annexed
to the United States were unjust to the North and
free States; and I do not intend to notice all the
plots and counter plots of the South, when Texas
annexation was first agitated; nor the indecent
manner in which the terms of annexation were
consummated, by which we were involved in the
Mexican war, b'tt simply refer to the connection
of this scheme with the slavery question. This
was a southern measure, to strengthen the slave
interest in this country. Its wholes-history shows
it. The joint n solutions providing for annexa-
tion provided for tlie formation of four new States
out of this territory; and, in fairness to the free
States, at least an equal portion should have free
territory; but, instead of this, they provide that
all territory south of 36° 30' should be left open
to slavery, and all north of that line free. Now,
any one who win take pains to look upon a map
of Texas, will find only a inere fragment lying
north of the Missouri compromise line. It is too
small ever to make a single State, and is a virtual
surrender of the whole territory to slavery, un-
der the miserable pretense of a division. Mr.
Buchanan, then a m&nber of the Senate, voted/or
the extension of the Missouri compromise line
through Texas, and made a speech in favor of it,
thereby acknowlrd^ing, as Mr. Benton says, in
his Thirty Years' view, the validity and con-
stitutionality of the Missouri compromise; and
yet he now turns round, in wonder and astonish-
ment, and declares '* it is sirungc that any one
ever thought it constitutional;" and because the
people of the free States refuse to turn a ridicu-
lous somerset like him, he insults them by de-
nouncing them as traitors and fanatics. Beautiful
consistency!
4. The next aggression upon the North which I
shall notice, was the repeal of the Missouri com-
prooMse. The history of that compromise has
been so thoroughly discussed before the country
that a repetition of it is unnecessary. It is suffi-
cient to say that it was a southern measure. Upon
the vote on the question of admitting Missouri
with the restriction, twenty Senators from the South
voted for it—only two against it. In the House
of Representatives, upon the vote inserting the
Missouri restriction, thirty-nine southern Repre-
sentatives voted for it, and thirty-seven against.
We have not only the recorded votes to show this
a southern measure, but other testimony direct to
the point. Charles Pmckney, of South Carolina,
who was a member of that Congress, and voted
