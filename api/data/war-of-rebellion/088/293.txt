HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864-8 a. m.

General GRANT:

Ord's reserve, consisting of two small brigades, were put in Parke's line last night, permitting Willcox's division to go to Warren. Mott's division has just arrived and will release men of the Ninth Corps to go to Warren's support. Warren reports, at 7 a. m., that he has driven the enemy's cavalry down to Reams' Station; that the enemy are in force in his front, having been at work all night entrenching. Reports from pickets of the Ninth Corps would indicate a movement of the enemy to their right-our left.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 19, 1864-8.50 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

I think General Hancock, by detaining a large force north of the James, makes our force at Petersburg relatively as strong at it would be if the was with it. It also seems to be a sensitive point with the enemy. I am anxious to force the enemy to withdraw from the Valley the re-enforcements he has sent to early, and I think the best way to do it is to threaten as long a line as possible. If, therefore, there is no necessity for it, I shall not withdraw Hancock for the present.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864-9.30 a. m.

General GRANT:

Your telegram of 8.50 received. I will confer with General Warren and advise you whether, in his judgment and mine, more troops are required on the Weldon road than those sent by Parke. My impression now is that they are not, so long as the enemy is threatened on the north bank of the James.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864-10.20 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Send the accompanying dispatch* of General Grant to General Warren, and say that General Parke in the course of the day will send 4,000 men in addition to the 2,000 taken by willcox. Inquire whether, in Warren's judgment, these re-enforcements are sufficient for this purposes, that I may reply to General Grant. General Warren should at all hazards maintain his hold on the Weldon railroad, and, if practicable, to extend his line to connect with the Ninth Corps. At the same time if the enemy can be pushed back nearer the lead-works, so as to make the line shorter to the left of the Ninth Corps, it would be desirable do so.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
