did not peiceive that the resolution w as calculated
to ePpot that object speedily It seemed to him if

Mi PATTON then scnt the amendments he pro-
postd to submit to the Chair, pioviding that the
el etion ot all othei officers, ?* >' til as the pab! c
pnn'er,should be viva toce
The CHATR remaiked that thp amendment was
not strictly m order, because it related to a subject
not embiaced in the order of the House of 3 ester-
day, which read—
"Resolved, That this House do now proceed to
the choice of a printer to the House lor the 25th
Congress," and had no reference to any othei ap-
pointment th in that of printer
Ml PATTON called Ihe attention of the Chair
to Ihe fact, that the resolution of the gentleman
from Indiana was itself inconsistent with the teims
of the order of vesterday, for the latter piovided tor
the cbo ec of a prmtei to the vvhole " 25 h Con-
gress," but the former toi only the " first session"
of that Congress
Mr GHOLSON wis in the act of moving to
stuke out the worc's "for the fir t session," when
Mr BOON himsdf modified his resolution by
sinking out ihs  words teferied to
The CHAIR then eiit°r ane 1 the amendment of
Mi Pipton, which, aftei some remaiks fiom the
honorable movei, and Messrs BOXJLD1N, DAW-
SON, "nd BOON, was agreed to
Tne question leourung on the rcs-'a nn as
amended—
Mi BRIGGS considered the resolution "nt rely
unnecessary, and expressed his unfeigned astonish-
ment at the introduction of sucn a mcasuie, aftei
thej had been going on w ith the ballot foi iwo days
In adverting to the discussion on the same subject,
tv\ o j tai-s ago, he said he had opposed it then, and
should do so, be it introduced when oi by whom it
might
Mr BOULDIN replied at some length, m favor
of the mva voce mode of voting, and dwelt on its
consistency w ith the mode and practice of the Old
Dominion
Mi WISE said, he should vote for the pioposi-
tton, as he had heietofwe done on all occasions,
when it had been introduced He, howevei, cau-
tioned gentlemen vohng for Thomas Allen, to be
on then gusrd, tor that they would be marked and
doomed lo executive vengeance, the paitisan press
laking the lead, and giv ing the cue For this íea-
son he condemned the introduction of the resolu-
tion, though, being in favor of itr object, he should
v ote for it
Mr GHOLSON said that he himself, like the gen-
tleman fiom Virginia, (Mr Wise,) who last ad-
dicssed Ihe Chair, was m favor of the urna voce
mode of voting, not onlv va. that body, but m all
0 hers—not only foi public pnmei, but for every
Oihei appointment by the agents of the people Be-
ing in f?vor of it, also, like the gentleman, he was
indisposed to scieen himself from thi^iesolution, or
to skulk fiom the lesponsibihtj of the open vote
proposal bj it, for he had never gn en a vote which
In lean J 1 have exposed to his constituents and
