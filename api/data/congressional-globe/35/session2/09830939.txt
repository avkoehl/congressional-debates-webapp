the footing of a joint interest, and, therefore, a
joint protectorate, over the isthmian routes. This
negotiation ended m tne Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
the most prenosterousengagementinto which the
United States ever entered. ,
How Great Britain has observed that treaty,
in spirit, letter, or effect, I need not here relate.
We are all of opinion (and have often so said) that
her conduct has been a persistent violation of it
in every particular. -And yet, sir, from year to
year this violation progresses, until Nicaragua
has been dismembered, and even blotted from the
roll of nations. Between the Mosquitos oil the
one side, and Costa Rica, under French protec-
tion, upon the other, nothing is left to her; and
when the Republic of Nicaragua is mentioned, in
correspondence or in debate, we know it is a
mere sound, an empty name, a myth of no signi-
fication. A handful of miscreants, under English
and French influence, with no territorial domin-
ion, -without any power at home or abroad, are
permitted, by diplomatic quackery, to usurp and
profane the title of her that is dead. Our steamships
are searched by British men-of-war in the very
harbor of San Juan; and we content ourselves, as
we did at the last session, by three or four tame
resolutions, and by sending a large fleer to Paia-
guay, in South America, in order to coerce an
insignificant tyranny there. The Nicaraguan
route is no longer traveled; and, as for the route
of Panama, our citizens have been wounded,
menaced, and shamefully abused, without any
redress, when they ventured Us passage.
rlhe impunity v/ith which Great jBntain and
France ha\o conducted their agressions m Cen-
tral America, since Mr. Polk Wt the presidential
chair, now emboldens them to still more audacious
enterprises. It is upon Mexico, at length, their
ambition has seized. She, aiso, appealed to us;
and having once secured to our citizens, by
treaty, the route across the Isthmus of Tehuan-
£epec, she had a just claim on us for protection
against the oveiwhelming stiength of Euiopean
assault. Instead of such protection, or even a
"Word of kindness, we suffered the constitutional
Government of Mexico to be undei mined by in-
trigues within and violence without; until now,
(as the last packet informs us,) the navies of Great
Britain and France do not scruple to blockade the
ports of Vera Cruz and Tampico, in order, to com-
pel a reduction of the taufl'on impoited merchan-
dise. That Cuba will remain exempt from the
operation of a scheme so long meditated, and so
boldly pursued, is more than I can buieve: the
scheme includes her, and includes evriy inch of ij
tins comment, as well as of the islands ad^cent. I-
In a moment of unusual jubilation, while the !|
"holy alliance " of Great Bi.tiinand Fiance was |j
urging Ili;sMa to the brink cf ruin, a U'riush Sec-
retary o.''^t.%to assured a faithful Parliament that
other, and ulteiio*', and oven more important,
affairs w^e m contemplation. I allude, sir, to
the speech of Loid Clarendon, in winch he de- j
clared: j
"The union between the two Onv',i'm,ont?ha= not hen ■
<\mfin<U to tue extern que-non. T!ic happy accord and j
£"od understanding between Fi. nee ;uid Encl.md, have |
Ij-joti e\Jen cdb<'\opd tlio Ea<-tK>n policy to >ln; policy at- |

«ard to w hi eh the poliev 01'the two eountrie-. however acre- ;
t'oi'OiC atita/oniitic. it not now in entire harmony." i
To bo sure, this had no relation to us—not the !
slightest! Wa? not our amiable Minister so as- ;
suied, in terms at once condescending and confi- '
de.-iUai? What else it could mean, or to whom '
be rpphed, Mr. Dallas did not ascertain; but.cer- ■
tiTirJy, to such as arc unskilled in diplomatic in- :
tereiiurse, looking at the events of Central Amor- ;
iea and Mexico since that time, it would seem as i
if the United States were about to become another '
tfcbastopol, and beleaguered on every side-. !
As I have no confidence in the "explanations" :
vouchsafed to us with regard to Lord Claren-
don's speech, I expert and believe that any seri- ;
ous attempt on our part to acquire Cuba, by ne- |
gotiaUon or otherwise, will bte obstructed. The ,
benator from New York has told us the truth for !
once; and we must either assert our independ-
ence, our right to control the destinies of th-s
continent^ free of ril domination or dictation by
Great Britain, or France, or any other Euiopean
Fo\u r, or < Ise abandon ourselves te tne ivnlr <* f
Sardinia, Ponugal, and tin1 Geimnti Slates. \\ e
aie to be cOrntbody; or nohudy, m the woild; and,
for one, I would as lief decide tjiat in Cuba as upon
any other spot of earth. *Let us, at all events,
know the worst; and if our time of abasement has
arrived, let us, with what composure we can, kiss
the feet of our masteis,a*nd teach our children to
do the same.
I might well be asked, entertaining such opin-
ions, why vote for the bill now proposed ? Sim-
ply, sir, because it can do no harm; and if, per-
chance, the President should be able to acquire
Cuba in this manner, I would not only feel, but
would publicly express, more satisfaction than to i
see my own apprehensions realized. As to the !
objections of detail urged by the Senator from '
New York, some days since, I esteem them of
very little importance. The bill provides an ap- >
propriation of $30,000,000 to be paid for a cession |
of the island, with us dependencies; which amount !
is to be raised by a loan at five per cent., and so '
much as may lie necessary paid whenever the j
treaty shall have been ratified by Spain. If the ;
bill should be successful, therefore, it will be an |
appropriation of money, by law, from the Treas- j
ury of the United States, in strict accordance*1
with the Constitution, and for an object as clearly :
and exactly defined as any object specified m our ;
annual appropriation bills. The law is to be cx- ■
ecuted, of course, by the President of the United {
States, as all other laws aie required to be exe- '
cuted; and the money expended through the De-
partmentofState, orsomeof our ministers abroad, j
as other appropriations for like purposes always .
have been', and always must be, expended. The :
outlines of the bill are m pursuance of three famous j
acts of our legislation—the act of February 26, '
1803, under which Louisiana was purchased; the ,
act of February 33, 1805, intended for the case !
of Florida; and the act of March 3, 1817, which j
ed to lhc acquisition of New Mexico and Cah- !
fornia. !

out of any money In the Treasury not otherwise appropri-
ated, to enable the President to conclude a treaty of peace,
limits, and boundaries with the Republic of Mexico, to be
used by him m the event that said treaty, when signed by
the authorized agents of the two Governments and duly
ratified by Mexico, shall call for the expenditure of the
same or any part thereof; full and accurate accounts for
which expenditure shall be by him transmuted to Congress

Approved, March 3,1847. *
Two of these acts, it will be observed, were' in
the time of President Jefferson—certainly as little
disposed as any President ever was, or ever will
be, to encroach on the legislative department, or
tolerate any increase of Executive p'ower and in-
fluence.
Indeed, sir, until now, our mosteminent states-
men do not seem to have discovered that such a
bill confers on the President any control over the
Treasury, or any undue control over the conduct
of our foreign relations. I am willing to err (if it
be an error) with them; although,certainly, what-
ever amendment can be suggested by the Senator
from New York, or any one else, to restrain this
appropriation of money to the object intended, or
otherwise'guard against an abuse or misemploy-
ment of the powers to be conferred, will receive
my" vote and assistance.
As to the substitute proposed by the Senators
from New York and Vermont, as a minority of
the Committee on Foreign Relations, it does not
deserve much comment. The first section re-
quires the President to communicate to the Sen-
ate, at the beginning of the next session, " if in
his opinion not incompatible with the public in-
terest,'* the condition of our relations with Spain, f
ttt that time, as well as the condition of the Treas-
ury, the Aimy, and the Navy. The second sec-
tion authorizes him to convene the Senate, or
Congress, " in extraordinary session," whenever
he may consider that advisable. Inasmuch asull
these duties or powers have been expressly con-
fided to the President by the Constitution, our
recapitulation of them, in a statute, would be as
idle, and even as ludicrous, as one could wellini-
i airuie.
| "I am content to fortify the President with the
j mepns and the powers which he now asks at our
j hands. No mischief can ensue, as I have said,
j in case of failure; because, without a. treaty for the
| cession of Cuba, no money is to be paid, or eve:l
! borrowed, inasmuch as none will be required,
j It is .said, however, that we thus commit our-
! selves, in advance, to the ratification of whatever
[ treaty the President may negotiate. I think not.
1 Spain knows, or will know, quite as well as we,
: that the treaty must.be ratified according to the re-
; qunements of our Constitution, or else be wholly
| inoperative. Whe ratified the treaty of February
! 2^, 1819, with modificotions; and these were after-
! wards accepted by us.
j There is no "blank draft "on the Treasury—no
: phiige or guaranty for the payment of one dime
; Ley ond $30,(100,000 in this bill; and the entire
treaty will he subject to ratification, amendment,
I or rejection, by the Senate, as all other treaties
< tue. if the Presiderit should simulate for a larger
: consideration to Spam, whether in money or other-
' wise, than two tl'irds of the Senate believe to be
adF'-inta^eoup, in the eitcumstances, that will end
' the maty, or i'-hd to further negotiation.
It is fu^st- d, also, that we will forfeit the
' oi ca^j we do not ratify tho treaty:
but j-hko an objection, if evers'i valid, must hn\e
apphed as well to al! past negotiations of this
ehatoetor. I do not pee, for my own part, how
a forfeit'iie can rightfully he predicated of such a
case: hutasSpain has always been dilatory in I he
payiYupt of b-r debt*. \ ossum" rhaf we may Jose
the amot'io paid in advance, (whelhcr
■ or less,) if the treaty be not ratified
uit 'iiii* side. The amount is a large one, and pur-
fnvhu • vin the-financidi embanassment which has
<wertaken us. 1 unden.ite none of these
rs'ieruauoiis; bu!, after all, so essential do [
'\>n: d"r the acquisition of Cuba to our prosper-
ity so anxious am I 'to avoid the dblicultios
w'hich gather, from day to day, over the whole
subiect; urging us steadily toward a rupture with
Great Britain and Frarn^, as well as with Spain;
that I will take any reasonable risk, or stretch
1 the credit of the United States to any reasonable
• extent, rather than to suffer one more year to
1 elapse wthout some definite, and, as I fervently
hope, some decisive action. I do think, how-
evci-, the bill should contain a limitation to the
