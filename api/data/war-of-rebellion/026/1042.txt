GENERAL: All I desire you to is to support two regiments, which I have on picket, until to-night.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

J. B. HOOD,

Major-General.

P. S. -They have formed in a heavy line in Law's front, and have set the woods on fire to try and smoke out his skirmishers. They have also formed in front of my two regiments near you. Please be ready to support them.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

I am left here with two brigades, or 4,000 men, to defend a line of 40 miles in length, from Fort Powhatan to South Quay, with 25,000 of the enemy in front.

I protest against being left with an inadequate force. I must have at least three brigades.
