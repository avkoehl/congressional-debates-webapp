HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, September 30, 1863.

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my division from June 15 to July 31, embracing the campaign in Pennsylvania and battle of Gettysburg: My division comprised the Stonewall Brigade, Brigadier General J. A. Walker, consisting of the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Twenty-seventh and Thirty-third Virginia Regiments, commanded, respectively, by Colonel [J. Q. A.] Nadenbousch, Major [William] Terry, Colonel [J. H. S.] Funk, Lieutenant-Colonel [D. M.] Shriver, and Captain [J. B.] Golladay; J. M. Jones' brigade, consisting of the Twenty-first, Twenty-fifth, Forty-second, Forty-fourth, Forty-eighth, and Fiftieth Virginia Regiments, commanded, respectively, by Captain W. P. Moseley, Colonel [John C.] Higginbotham, Captain [J. M.] Richardson, Captain [T. R.] Buckner, Lieutenant-Colonel [R. H.] Dungan, and Lieutenant-Colonel [L. H. N.] Salyer; George H. Steuart's brigade, consisting of the Tenth, Twenty-third, and Thirty-seventh Virginia Regiments, First Maryland Battalion Infantry, and First and Third North Carolina Regiments, commanded, respectively, by Colonel [E. T. H.] Warren, Lieutenant-Colonel [S. T.] Walton, Major [H. C.] Wood, Lieutenant-Colonel [H. A.] Brown, Major [W. M.] Parsley, and Lieutenant-Colonel [J. R.] Herbert; Nicholl's brigade, Colonel J. M. Williams commanding, consisting of the First, Second, Tenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Louisiana Regiments, commanded, respectively, by Lieutenant-Colonel [M.] Nolan, Lieutenant-Colonel [R. E.] Burke, Major [T. N.] Powell, Lieutenant-Colonel [D.] Zable, and Major [Andrew] Brady, with Andrews'battalion of artillery, Major [J. W.] Latimer commanding, consisting of Raine's, Dement's, Brown's, and Carpenter's batteries. On June 16, my division left camp at Stephenson's and marched to Shepherdstown, where Jones' brigade was temporarily detached, with orders to destroy a number of canal-boats and a quantity of grain and flour stored at different points, and cut the canal [Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]. A report of his operations and the disposition made of his captures has been forwarded. June 18, we crossed the Potomac at Boteler's Ford, and encamped upon the battle-ground of Sharpsburg. Thence marched, via Hagerstown and Chambersburg, to within 3 miles of Carlisle. From Greencastle, Steuart's brigade was ordered to McConnellsburg, to collect horses, cattle, and other supplies which the army needed. The brigade, having accomplished its mission to my satisfaction, rejoined the division at our camp near Carlisle. On June 29, in obedience to orders, I countermarched my division to Greenville, thence eastwardly, via Scotland, to Gettysburg, not arriving in time, however, to participate in the action of the 1st instant.
