We have no transportation here at all. Before I got down here all horses were taken out of the fort. Where they are I don't know. Enemy got them, I suppose. Not a horse in the fort. Please send on a flat to Battery Buchanan two wagons and teams and three courier horses.

FORT FISHER, December 26, 1864 - 12.30 p. m.

General BRAGG:

Colonel Lipscomb just in. I send him back with instructions to try and keep communication open. Send me for to-night 500 veteran infantry, the same as were here the other night. I am communicating with Smithville. Just got your dispatch of yesterday. Will not give up or evacuate this place so long as a man is left to stand to his gun. Unless overpowered by heavy boat attack we will hold. It is for that I want re-enforcement to-night. I think enemy are on the beach. Please try and keep up land communication with me by the river or by small boats.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
