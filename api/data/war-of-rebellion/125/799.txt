Any soldier in the Regular Army, therefore, re-enlisting under General Orders, Numbers 25, current series, from this office, will, if he has served and enlisted as above stated, be entitled to the extra pay of $ 2 per month from date of enlistment.

ORDNANCE OFFICE,

October 22, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The following report of the principal operations of the Ordnance Department during the past year is respectfully submitted. To that report I avail myself of the occasion to add such remarks and recommendations respecting the future service of the department as the public interest, in my judgment, calls for.

The fiscal resources and disbursements of the department during the year were as follows:

Amount of appropriation remaining in the Treasury June 30, 1863:

In the Government depositories to the credit of

disbursing officers on same date ..................$3,122,979.11

Amount of appropriations from June 30, 1863, to

June 30, 1864, including the fixed annual appro-

Received since June 30, 1863, on account of damages

to arms in hands of troops, from sales of arms to

officers and of condemned stores, and from all other

sources not before mentioned ...................... 141,023.01

-------------

Total .............................................45,279,002.12

Amount of expenditures since June 30, 1863 ........38,502,822.99

In the public depositories to the credit of disbur-

Amount of appropriations remaining in the Treasury

at same date ...................................... 4,978,791.97

-------------

Total .............................................45,279,002.12

The estimates for the next fiscal year, which have been submitted, are predicated from the average amounts actually required and expended during similar periods lately passed, taking into consideration supplies which will remain over for use during the year and supposing a similar scale and character of military forces and operations. On this basis the amounts estimated are as nearly accurate as it is possible to make them, and any curtailment, therefore, in the appropriations, without a warranting change in the condition of the country, will only result in a necessary future call to supply deficiencies.

The ordnance, arms, and other ordnance supplies which this department has procured by fabrication and purchase and which it has supplied to the troops during the past fiscal year, as also those at the arsenals and ordnance depots, are shown in detail by the accompanying statements. From these it will be seen that the fabrications and
