HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES,
Wfdnesday, Dec. 13, 1837
Mr FLETCHER of Massachusetts asked per-
mission of ihe Chairto make some statements in le-
fterence lo a publication which-had appeared in the
Globe oí thxt morning-, signed bv certain members
of the Committee oí Ways and Means
The publication alluded to is as follows
The undersigned have seen, with surprise, an
altack mide upon the majority of the Commutes of
Ways and Mean*-, by the Hon Richard Fletcher,
of Massachusetts, a member of that committee at
the late extra session In a speech purporting to
have been delivered m Taneui* Htl', and published
m the Alias and o her papers at Boston, the place
oí that member's, residence, the following statement
and charges a-e made, and have not, to their
knovvledse, been disavowed bv him He sajsthat
"During ihe session, Ihe business projects upon
which the House weic called to act, came almost

and the Executive majoi itit in the Mouse pass each bill
forthwith, without a'teralion—and so far as depends
upon them, %ithout debate—jj,st as it comes from their
maileis at the uhite house "
The member from Massachusetts alleges that
the chairman of the committee "steps up to the
white house, and there receives liom the President
or the Secretary of the Trcasi }, such bills as they
wish lo have pajsed by the House The chairman
puts the bills into his pocket, takes them to the
committee, without any examination the majority
©£ the eommxttee approve them."
The chairman of the committee states m reply,
that he had no consultation whatever with the Pre-
sident concerning any one of the bills reported by
the committee, nor did he receive either of the bills,
or any part of either, from him The usage from
the commencement of the Government has been
for the comrrittee, through its chairman, to consult
the head of the Department in regard to such mea-
sures as he may recommend for the consideration
of Congress, for the Secretary to attend on, and
confer with, the committee, if invited, and to fur-
nish drafts of bills embracing his own piopositions,
when requested to do so* This is but an act of
courtesy to the officer who recommends a measure
connected with the business of his department, and
whose duty it is, when the law is enacted, to con-
stiue and execute it                                 '
The chairman of the committee did consult the
Secretary of the Treasury about the bills referred
to, and he did so with the knowledge and assent of
the committee. At his request the Secretary of
the Treasury transmitted to him diafts of most of
the bills, but the undersigned declare it to be ut-
terly untrue that any one of them was adopted by
the committee. The measures recommended in
the Treasury report were duly consideied by the
committee, but not on  of the bills reported cor-
responded in form with any piepared by the Secre
tary, and most of them essentially differed i  prin-
ciple from the suggestions of that officer
The memberfrom Massachusetts not only alleges
that the majority of the committee approved the
bills "without any examination," but he "avers
that eveiy important bill passed by the House
came to the House, ready drawn, from the Execu-
tive," and that "the Executive majority m the
House passed each bill forthwith, without altera-
tion—and, s.o far as depends upon them, without
debate " The bills reported by both commit-
tee", differing as they do, and Ihe proceedings of
the two Houses upon them, prove these stilt ments
to bp untrue The two Houses had assembled at
an exti a session and there was   «reneril desire,
without regard to pirtv, to make it a chort one
From Hi different organization, the Senate was
enabled to appoint its committees on ti e 8th of
September, those of the House were not announced
till the 11th of that month Before the Committee
of Ways and Means met on the 12th,the Commit-
tee on Tinance of the Senate hid been for some
days employed in prep inn" the bids, conseqnent'y,
the former had no opportunity to act unon them
until after they had been matured by the latter
committee B ith Houses were anriovrs that all
the bills should be repoiiod without dela\, and the
Committee of Ways and Means were in session
dn'y nil the most importan were submitted to the
Hotis-e. In examining Ihe^e bills, it will he found
that the rnnji ntj of Ihe Commi'tee of Ways and
Means not only differed with the "Senitc commit-
tee, Hit with ihe leport of the Seirctarv of the
Treasury, brth in principle an 1 in deti 1
The bill of the Senate author ?el Treasury notes
to be issued be>arms: interest, the bill iep< i ted to the
House directed them to be issued -without mtciest
The former proposed interest from the d ite, and
for twelve months only the latlei p-ovidcd, that if
they were not redeemed at the expiralion of that
(pun, the interest should then commerce The de-
tail* of the two bills were consequently essential-
ly diff  rent At ihe snegostmn of a member of
the committee an additional penal section vas in-
troduced into the bi'l, with the enncntrence of the
member from Massachaselts The Secretary of
the Treasury, m his riport, pioposed an is ue of
Tieas iry notes of small denomin?tions, the bill of
the Committee of Wajs and Mens authored
noie to be issued under one hundred do'lars Th"
former recommended that thev should be re-issued,
the latter contained no such provision
The next and the most important bill, commonly
called the " divorce bill" was essentially amended
The bill reported to the S-nate re1 ited hholly to
the safe keeping of the public ¡none*, md con-
tained no provision as to tbe medium in which it
was to be collected. The Committee of Ways and
Means added another section providing for this
material point, and altered the title of the bill ac-
cordingly.
The bill further postponing the payment of mer-
chants' bonds, as reported to the House, contained
an additional section, giving a credit on the duties
on merchandise remaining in the public stores upon
which the dunes were payable in cash a provision
not suggested in the Treasury- Report, nor tmbiac-
ed in the Senate bill. The Committee on Ways
and Means, subsequently, and unanimously, in-
structed its chairman to move to stake out the ad
section of the Senate bill, which proposed to make
th ^additional credit upon bonds applicable to impor-
tations, for one year from and after the 1st October,
and to insert the section referred to, extending the
credit to three and six months on all merchandise
which was then in the public warehouses, or might
arrive before the 1st of November Amendments
were also rrade to other bills, but those mentioned
v\ ere the most material.
The member from Massachusetts is still more
particular in his statements about the origin and
history oí these bills. He says that the President
and theHeadsof Departments"onginate every thing,
put every thing m the precise shape they wish,
word for word, letter for letter, comma for comma,
and the Executive majority in the House pass each
bill forthwith, without alteration—and so lac as de-
pends upon them without dábate—just as it comes
irora their masters in the White House' "
The undersigned, to ascertain whether these
grave and extraordinary charges were founded m
truth, have compared the drafts of-the bills fur-
nished to the chairman by the Secretary of the
Treasury, with the bills reported by the Committee
of Ways and Means No drafts were received of
the bills relating to the fourth instalment under the
deposite act, the banks in this District, or the
warehousing of merchandise. It is proper here to
state, that a warehousing hill was reported at a
former session by the present chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, and prior to the
recommendation of the Secretary of the I'reasary.
The bills received from the Secretary were those
for adjusting claims on the deposite banks, ex-
tending the merchants' bonds, making public o.fi-
cers the keepers of the public money, and aulho-
ruing Treasury notes to be issued. The bills relati nsr
to the merchants' bonds, and the claims apon the
banks reported by the Committee oi Ways and
Means, difTer both in language and t men le f'oai
those prepared by the Secretary Ol the ten sec-
tions of the bill pro- ldmg for the -*afe 1 eepm<r, of
