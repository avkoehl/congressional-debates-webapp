Major-General SCHOFIELD, Raleigh:

Give no passes at present to Washington. The President does not desire to see delegations at this time. I have here permitted justices of the peace who took the oath of allegiance and are of good character to resume their functions. The idea that slavery has ceased must be everywhere impresed, but the freedmen must be made to understand that they are not to be fed by us. They must work for a living. They should not be permitted to leave the plantations and flock to the large cities, where they can get no labor.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
