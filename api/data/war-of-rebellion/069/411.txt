Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my pickets communicate with General Warren's command. The left of the infantry line rests upon the road to Bethesda Church, about 300 yards beyond Gilmans' Mill. General Torbert's advance is within about one-half mile of the Cold Harbor.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Eleventh Alabama Infantry, belonging to Rodes' division, Ewell's coprs, Battle's brigade, came into our lines last evening. He reports Lee's army strongly entrenched near Mechanicsville; that Rodes' division marched out yesterday 1 1\2 miles this side of the works to make a reconnaissance, but he is unalbe to state whether the whole army marched out at the same time or not.

HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Cold Harbor, Va., May 31, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: All the indications to-day lead to the brief that the enemy meditated an attack on the First Division of cavalry posted 1 1\2 miles from Cold Harbor, so I gave permission to General Torbert to attack them. He did so, encountering Fitz. Lee's division of cavalry and one brigade of Hoke's division of infantry (Clingman's), driving them from their barricades in Cold Harbor, and capturing about half a regiment and 15 of Clingman's infantry. Since then the second brigade, of Hoke's division, has arrived. I do not feel able to hold this place, and have directed General Torbert to resume his position of this morning. Lee's line of battle is in front of Mechanicsville, and, with the heavy odds against me here, I do not think it prudent to hold on. The enemy is now extending toward Gaines' Hill, to cover the bridges across the Chickahominy.

The First Division behaved very gallantly. The wounded are all being sent to the rear. We will have 70 or 80.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
