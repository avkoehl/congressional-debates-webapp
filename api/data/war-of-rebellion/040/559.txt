For the purpose of estimating the loss in clothing, camp and garrison equipage thrown away and left on the field, I accompany this report with a list of these articles supplied on requisition from the date of the return to this camp (May 7) to the present date, at which time the men are fully supplied,

The loss in overcoats was probably the greatest, but as the men do not require for the loss, at this season, it does not appear [sic.]. The best criterion by which to judge of the waste is in blankets, the amount drawn for being 3,011. Our effective force being now 8,000, three-eighths of the men have lost one blanket each. The knapsacks drawn amount to 4,614, showing more than half lost, probably on the battle-field, by being relieved of them during action.

Four thousand shelter-tents have been supplied, showing a loss of one-half; 1,768 canteens have been supplied, one-fifth lost; 2,980 haversacks supplied, three-eighths lost; 3,017 rubber blankets supplied, three-eighths lost. The balance, being articles of clothing supposed to be worn out, ar not noticed.

Not having been with the marching column, I cannot decide from observation on the question of the advantage of loading the men heavily and with knapsacks. Reliable officers inform me that the men, though much fatigued, did not straggle, and that the result of the last march is more successful than former marches, when the roads were incumbered by trains. I consider the experiment of using pack-mules successful, and, with the experience we have had in the last march, it will prove an important part of the transportation.

Respectfully submitted by your obedient servant,

W. R. HOPKINS,

Lieutenant Colonel, and Chief Quartermaster Twelfth Army Corps.
