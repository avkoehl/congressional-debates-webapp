tends into market at a price proportionate to their
value—at a price which will induce purchasers to
enter them for cultivation—to fill up the population
of the new States—to develop their resources, and
mature their strength
Would the Senator from Kentucky (asked Mr
C ) cut off those who may own adjoining lands,
from the privilege of entering a limited quantity to
complete their settlements' He said many individ-
uals, poor, as wellas rich, had purchased and settled
on tracts not mOie than sufficient for cultivation,
would it be fair or just to deny them the privilege
of extending those tracts, by adding others at the
graduated prices, to supply them with timber and
pssture lands' This class would not puichasefor
speculation, yet they would be wholly denied the
benefits of the act, if the amendment of the Sen-
ator from Kentucky prevailed
Sir, we learn from the documents on our tables,
that there were about seventy one millions of acres,
Which have been subject to entry five years, and
upwaids, on the 30th September, 1837, and the
Senator from Kentucky exclaims, in reference to
this quantity, that the bill will operate on land
enough to make two large States and that it will
make a difference of $35,000,000, in the amount
of money to be obtained for it1 Wow, sir, is this
a fair mode of treating the subject' Why, sir,
we ail know, or ought to know, that it is shown
by the report of the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office, made in January last, in obe-
dience to a resolution of the Senate, that the gen
eral average price, under the entne cash system,
(which begun in July, 1820,) was only $1 27 4 5
cents per acre The same document tells us that
the average price of all the land, sold m 1828 and
1829, each, was only §1 26peracie—one cení gross
above the mimmum We all know, too, that the
mach-abused preemption laws had nothing to do
wtth producing this result .No general pieemp-
Uon law was then in existence, or ever had existed
before, the fiist general preemption law having
passed on the 23th May, 1830 Such aie the facts
n regard to the prices obtained for your most fer
iileand valuable lands, as shown by undeniable
evidence derived from the most authentic source
Vet the Senator from Kentucky declares that the
bill, which only proposes a reduction to seventy-
five cents per acre, will makea difference in the re-
ceipts from these íefuselands, equal to $35,000 000
Sir, heie is an assumptim that the lands em
braced by the bill would command as much a"
the best lands which have been sold by the Gov-
ernment under the cash system Can any one
seriously enteitam this opinion5 Why, sir,
14,276,155 aeies of this land had been in market,
and subject to private entry, at the minimum price
of $1 25, for twenty years and upwards, on the
30th of September last, 21 929,073 acres of it had
then been m market from fifteen years to twenty
years, and remained unbold at the minimum,
16,280,673 acres had then been in maiketfrom
ten to fifteen yeais, and remained unsold, at the
minimum, and 18,517,802 acres had then been m
market fiom five to ten year-!, and lemamed un-
sold at the minimum Is it fan, then, to assume
that this immense quantity of refuse land, em
bracing barren mountains and sterilepmebariens,
will ever command the Government price' No,
sir, much of it never will command any price,
and the one half, nay the one third, would not
sell at the present minimum in twenty years If
it would, it is betterfoi theGovernment to receive
seventy five cents per acre now if we compute
the interest on that price, even for twelve pears,
we shall find it equal to the reduction of fifty cents
per acre, the lowest contemplated by this bill
Sir, it is due to the future strength, resources,
and prosperity of the new States that these lands
should become the property of individuals The
law does not prevent the use of the timber which
is upon them, it may be cut down ard carried off
with impunity Transient settlers may go upon
them, cultivate them for a season, and remove to
others Having no permanent interest m the soil,
they will cultivate it without regard to us preser-
vation In this manner it will be stripped ot tim-
ber, worn out,ard exhausted, and depmed of all
its value to this Governmentor to theStates The
new States v ill tnus be denied the benefit of the
increase of population to which they are entitled,
and have their resources and productions dimin-
ished and crippled Even now, much of this
refuse land is daily deteriorating in value It is
our interest that every stick of timbei not abso-
lutely necessary for present use should be pre-
served, and that every acre of land should be
profitably and judiciously cultivated
But, sir, as I have heietotore contended, the
United States are bound, in good faith, to reduce
the puce of inferior lands till they will bell Can
it be regarded within the terms of the compact
urder which the new States were admitted, that
those lands are never to be sold, unless they will
command $1 25 per acre, or any other given
price' By no means, accoidwg to his under-
standing The new States were required to dis-
claim all right and title to the waste and unappro-
priated lands within their limits, and that the
same should remain at the sole and entire dispo-
sition of the United States, and, moreover, that
every tract of land sold by the United States,
after the admission of such new States, shouldbe
exempt from taxation of every sort for the term
of five years from the date of such sale These,
with the right to tax the lands of the United States
within then limits, and various other rights of sov-
ereignty, were required to be surrendered, but the
terms speak of, and contemplate a sale by, the
United States, they clearly imply an obligation
to sell Then, is it a fulfillment of that obligation
to refuse to sell those lands for a pi ice equal to
their value—to refuse to bell them for what they
aie woith' Certainly not If the obligation
could be dischaiged by fixing a price, it mi¿ht be
done by establishing five oi ten dolíais as the mm
lmum This could not he egarded, however, as
aperfoimance of the compact m good faith, for
the lands would not sell at all, it would be tanta-
mount to declaring that none of this land should
thereafter be sold, which all would pronounce a
palpable and flagrant breach of faith Sir, the
only way for this Government to perform its obli-
gation in good faith is, to offer those lands at their
fair relative value, such as are of any value will
then sell, but to hold all the different qualities at
one fixed puce is just as absurd as to require the
sime puce for all domestic animals of the same
species, or to hold all fabrics, manufactured of
the same material, whethei fine or coarse, to be of
equal value
Mr C said, as a financial metsure, also, the
bill was now entitled to the favorable consideration
of the Senate It would be recollected (he said)
that the bill had been,on the motion of hishonoi-
able friend from Missouri, [Mi Benton,] referred
to the Committee on Finance, to considei and re-
poit upon its probable effects upon the receipts of
the Treasury The result (he said) was known,
the report of that committee, sustained by the
opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, was
upon our tables, and established that its operation
would be altogethei favorable It would enhance
the receipts of the Treasury, when those derived
from other sources were not only limited at pres-
ent, but diminishing every year, under the opera-
tion of the compromise tariff law Without the
aid of this measure, it was apparent (he said) that
we should be compelled to lesort to other loans to
sustain the Government He asked, could it be
sound policy to borrow money at any rate of in
terest, rather than supply the wants of theTieas
ury by a sale of these inferior lands at a fair
price'
Taking the measure in every nomt of view,
under the provisions of the several compacts, in
refeience to the claims of the new States, or the
obligations of this Government m reference to the
interests of the new States, oi those of the Union, |
it was of beneficial tenduicy     He did not desire
to consume more of the time of the Senate, indeed,
he had not intended to consume any portion of it I
on this occasion, as the bill had not changed in its
pio\ision since the last session, when it had un-
dergone a thorough discussion, and was passed by I
a decided majority     He had hoped, and some-
what expected, it would have passed at the pres
ent session by a silent vote     Noi could he now
suppose—as no new objection had been stated, l
and no new aigument against its justice or expe-
diency had been piesented, which had not before I
been considered—that the vote of any honorable I
Senator would be changed Mr C confidently
anticipated its passage now, by a majority as
large as that by which it had passed at the last
sess'on
Mr BENTON was glad that the motion had
been made—that was to say, coming from the
quarter it did, and the yeas and nays having been
ordered on it, would, after having been taken, do
away every objection to the new pietmption law
which would be brought forward at the next ses-
sion It would do away all objections as to the
constitutionality and justice of the measure, m
giving a preference to one class of citizens over
another, while it would also be an abandonment
of all objections that had been taken to the char-
acter of the settlers And again- he would say
with a great deal of sincerity, that he rejoiced at
the motion having been made, coming from the
quarter it did, and that the yeas and nays had
been ordered on it, as he should expect at the next
session eveiy yea recorded in favor of this motion
to be recorded also in favor of a preemption law
So much for the good of this motion, now for the
evil of it The fanners who aie cultivating their
farms in all the new States, from the borders of the
northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, would be
cut off by this amendment from the right of ac-
quiring from the refuse lands at the reduced prices,
which he contiguous to their farms, such additions
to them as they need, for the various supplies of
wood, water, quarries of stone, pasturage, outlet
for stock, <fcc , as well as for making a provision
for their children Now, how many of this class
of persons were to be cut off' The old settler)
who had been in the new States these ten and
twenty years, who had made roads and built mills
and churches, and had, by these means, made
these refuse lands of some value, were to be cut
off from the benefits of this bill Yes, sir, by these
means the entire population of the new States were
to be cut off—to be outlawed, so far as the acqui-
sition of the public domain is concerned—cut off
from the rights which they now enjoy by thelaws
of the land, of acquiring a small portion of the
refuse land contiguous to their farms, and which
may be essential for the perfection of their im-
provements Are we asked to inflict this injury
on four or five millions of people5 Were they
not even to be allowed to acquire the waste land
contiguous to them, even to keep offa bad neigh-
bor' No, he felt the utmost confidence in referring
this mattei to the Senate, that no such species of
outlawry would be enacted against half a million
of heads of families in the West What argument
was offered in favor it' Why, forsooth, to pre-
vent speculations, as if the bill, as it now stood,
did not limit the acquisition at the graduated price
to six hundred and forty acres, and that, too, to
be gathered up in different parcels' If six hun-
dred and forty acres of land, which has been left
without a purchaser for five or ten or fifteen or
twenty years, and which would not be accepted
as a gift from the sovereignties from whom we
acquired this territory, are to be regarded as a
speculation, and the people are to rush upon it,
he apprehended that such a man as John Jacob
Astor had proved himself to be by his conduct in
business was not the man to engage in such specu-
lations He apprehended that the fifty years Mr
Astor had been engaged successfully m business,
gave a sufficient contradiction to any such idea
The fears of the Senator from Kentucky were
vain Show me (said Mr B ) the exception m
the West where the man who extensively specu-
lated in these lands did not become bankrupt,
where even his own heieditary fortune was not
eaten up bv the continued losses, by taxes, by
the infidelity of agents, and by a thousand other
drawbacks to which such laige speculators are
inevitably subjected Six hundred and forty acres
to each purchaser was the quantity to which the
bill now limited the sales, and we hear the loud
appeal—the appeal forever made against touching
the land system whenever any measure of the
kind is brought forward to encourge the agncui-
tural industry of the new States
I utterly deny (said Mr B ) that we are touch-
ing the land system I utterly deny that we are
touching any part of the system of surveyírg, or
of giving title to the public lands It is the price
alone that is to be touched, and that has been oper-
