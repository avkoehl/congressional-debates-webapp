Lieutenant Wise has returned. I have two small scouting parties in the Snibar Hills. Had I not better send one full company out this evening north and east from Lone Jack?

PLEASANT HILL, June 13, 1864.

Captain JAMES H. STEGER,

Warrensburg:

I have reliable information that the enemy are full 500 strong. I now need 520 horses to mount my command. Horses are becoming unserviceable every day from overwork. I think a large portion of the enemy are now camped in Greenton Valley and Sni Hills. Shall I move after them or wait until they strike for some place?

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 13, 1864-9 p. m.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

You will find Major Neill, Captain Burris, and Captain Wyckoff north of the Black Water, in the vicinity of Basin Knob. Move so as to co-operate with them, and unite your forces if you find the enemy too strong. Take horses from the people and mount your men, giving receipts for them.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
