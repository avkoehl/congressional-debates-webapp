HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 19, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE CONFEDERATE FORCES OCCUPYING PETERSBURG:

I have to propose to you a cessation of hostilities, say for one or two hours, during which time unarmed parties with medical officers can, under a flag of truce, bury the dead and remove the wounded of each army, if any, now lying between the respective lines. Should you deem it proper to accede to this arrangement I would be pleased if you would designate the hours, and so designate them that there will be time after receipt of your reply to make the necessary arrangements. I beg leave to offer in excuse for the manner of addressing you my ignorance of the forces and the general commanding in my front.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 19, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

What do you say to my proposal about exchanging Ferrero for Martindale? Burnside seems anxious to get his old troops back, and now would be and excellent time for the exchange, if it is to be done.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, June 19, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

I notified General Butler on the 17th that it was my intention to transfer Getty's old division back to the Ninth Corps, and give him in place of it the colored division commanded by Ferrero. General Butler expressed no objection to the change so far as it could be made; but said that the division had been broken up long ago, and that part of it is now in North Carolina; he said, however, he would ascertain what regiments were here of the old organization and report to me, so they might be transferred. Tell Burnside to send me a list of the regiments he wants and I will transfer much of them as are here.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
