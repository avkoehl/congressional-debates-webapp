Cars arrived at Cleveland 17th instant from Chattanooga with six regiments of infantry, commanded by Colonel or Brigadier-General Logan. Reliable citizen says no troops have gone from Cleveland to Knoxville in several days on railroad. At least twelve pieces of artillery at Cleveland. Three or four trains reported going toward Knoxville for several days loaded with provisions. Bridge at Loudon expected to be completed 1st March.

DALTON, February 19, 1864-8 p. m.

Colonel M. H. WRIGHT,

Atlanta, Ga.:

If, as we are led to suppose, troops are moving to West Point from Augusta, as well as from this place, General Johnston wishes the following rule to be observed in moving them from Atlanta: If a division of troops from this place or from Augusta has started from Atlanta, troops arriving from the other point must wait until the entire division that has started has passed Atlanta. Please give General Johnston notice by telegraph of all troops expected from the East or arriving at Atlanta from the East. It will guide him in sending troops from here. It is useless for more than 3,000 to go to West Point per day. We do not wish ours sent at a greater rate.

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,New Market, February 19, 1864.

Major G. W. DAY,

Commanding Battalion Cavalry:

The enemy has crossed all his cavalry over to Knoxville, and you must be on the lookout for it. It may move against you, though should it do so we would move on its rear. Be well on your guard, though, and keep us informed of anything your hear.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

OSMAN LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,New Market, February 19, 1864.

Brigadier General M. JENKINS,

Commanding Division:

The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to inform you that the enemy has moved his cavalry into Knoxville, and that it may annoy your troops on the other side of the river. Direct them to be prepared for it. Have the bridge fixed as soon as possible to-morrow and put another brigade on the other side of the river. One had better be down at the river early in the morning in supporting distance of the one across, if it be required.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

OSMAN LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
