colton's atlas of the world.
Mr. FOOT. I offer tho following resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on the Contingent Fund
of the Senate be directed to inquire into the expedient-) of
purchasing for the use of the Senate copies ot Col-
ton's Atlasi of the World.
I will merely state, on tho occasion of present-
ing tho resolution, that it is not my purpose that
the Senate should purchase any quantity of this
work for distribution to Senators, so that they
may retain them as their own property; but inas-
much as it is the latest and most complete atlas of
both hemispheres, and one to which all Senators,
more or less, h ave occasion for frequent reference,
the object of the resolution is simply to consider
the propriety of purchasing a limited number of
copies of the work, to be kept in the Secretary's
office, in order that Senators may be accommo-
dated with them from time to time. It is not
subject to the objection of being a resolution pur-
porting or intending to purchase this work as the
property of Senators, and to be delivered to them.
By unanimous consent, the Senate proceeded
to consider the resolution.
The PRESIDENT. With what number does
the Senator propose to fill the blank?
Mr. FOOT. I propose that the committee shall
fill the blank on reporting the resolution. It is
simply a resolution of inquiry.
The resolution was agreed to.
