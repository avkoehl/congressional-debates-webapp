HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,December 30, 1862.

General [JOHN S.] BOWEN:

GENERAL: I am instructed by General Price to say that the President, during his late visit to this place, assured him that he fully appreciated the importance of transferring the Missouri troops to the Trans-Mississippi Department, and that he had already given to the Secretary of War orders (which he would forthwith reiterate) to make the necessary arrangements for sending them thither in time to make the spring campaign in Missouri.* As they could not possibly accomplish any good by going there before spring time, and as their presence here at this time is absolutely necessary to the safety for the republic, the general hopes that every Missourian will remain willingly at the post of duty, and endeavor, under the leadership of our new chieftain, General Joseph E. Johnston, to further illustrate, by a prompt and cheerful obedience to orders in camp and on the field, the proud reputation of the Missouri Volunteers.

The general wishes General [M. E.] Green to communicate the President's promises informally to the officers and men of his brigade.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. L. SNEAD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
