I occupy Harrodsburg and am pushing the rear of the enemy, which is one hour in advance. Cannonading was heard in the direction of Lexington at this point two hours ago. You can ford everything a little distance above the bridge.

Respectfully,

E. GAY,

Chief of Cavalry.

[OCTOBER 11, 1862.]

General THOMAS:

Push one division, or whatever force further information may indicate to be necessary, across to the ford of Dick's river and put the rest of General Crittenden's corps across to the Harrodsburg and Danville road, so as to be in supporting distance if required. I understand the character of the country is such that you can move without regard to the roads until you get near Dick's River, when you will have to keep somewhat up toward Harrodsburg. Gilbert will follow and stop to-night at your present camp. Let me know what you do. I will be here to-night.
