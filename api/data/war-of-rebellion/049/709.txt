HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,September 10, 1863.

Brigadier General J. D. IMBODEN,

Commanding Valley District:

GENERAL: Your letter of August 25,27, and 31 have been received.

I regret exceedingly that the enemy escaped with so little damage to himself. I am sorry you could not go on to Huntersville to see General Jones when he sent for you in order to form some combined plan of operations before the attack.

It seems to me the comamnd of Averell should have been more seriously punished. Unless we are active in inflicting all the loss we can upon the parties sent on these expeditions, and is using every opportunity of cutting them off, they will continue to be sent out, will desolate the country, and bring great distress upon the people. I hope you will be more successful in future.

The success of Captain Hill's expedition into Barbour County is grafying and his boldness commendable. It shows what can be accomplished in the mountains by energy and skill. I desire you to seize every favorable occasion for inflicting damage upon the enemy.

Prominent citizens of the valley have made serious complaints of the conduct of Captain Shearer's company, of Gilmor's battalion. I wish you would see to it. If they cannot be brought under proper discipline, and continue to harass our own citizens by their bad conduct, they had much better be disbanded. Hon R. Y. Conrad, of Winchester, is one of the citizens preferring the complaint.

There is a company of Missourians here, and three other companies in Richmond, exchanged prisoners, who appear to be bold, brave men, who have been in the cavalry service. I telegraphed you to know whether you can mount then within a reasonable time. If you can, they will prove a valuable addition to your brigade.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
