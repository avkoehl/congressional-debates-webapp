General BUTLER:

On Friday night General Grant commanded a flank movement to complied Lee to abandon his position at Spotsylvania Court-House.

It has thus far progressed successfully. Longstreet moved south Friday night after Hancock had moved. Ewell followed last night. It is believe the rebel army will take position behind the South Anna. Hoke's force has joined Lee. Nothing of importance from any other quarter.

Major-General GILLMORE,

Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: It is desirable to ascertain position and strength of the enemy, whether there is any movement, and also whether there is any movement on the railroad. You are authorized to offer rewards for this purpose, not exceeding $500 each, to any shrewd, keen, and venturous men to the number of not more than 6, who will in their uniform penetrate the enemy's line urging the night as scouts and ascertain their condition and bring in valuable and reliable information. Explain to the men what is desired, and explain to them that false information will be as rigidly punished as true and valuable knowledge brought will be promptly rewarded.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General

(Same to General Smith.)
