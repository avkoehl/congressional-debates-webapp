Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:

Have General Sweeny take up a good position at the Rome Cross-Roads and await further orders. General Veatch's division will close up on Sweeny's, and you must be ready for any emergency. Major-General Logan's command will close up on you as fast as possible. In the mean time General Thomas' command is moving substantially down the line of the railroad. There may be some delay in getting across the river at Resaca, and you must not move out too rapidly as we are to keep abreast of Thomas.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
