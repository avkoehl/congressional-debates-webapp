CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Major-General GIBBON:

Please ask Captain Parker, of the Navy, why it is not practicable for him to place torpedoes where the rebel gun-boats pas the obstructions, and why is it not practicable for him to attack when they pass with but two boats, as was the case this evening. There ought to be quite a fleet of gun-boats at the front.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

In the Field, January 24, 1865-4.55 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I do not hear from Captain Parker, and do not know whether he intends to place torpedoes or not. I have heard nothing of the officer and barges sent up by you, and have myself made no other arrangements than to prepare to throw some vessels into the bridge-draw, which, from the depth of water, can be of but little service. A movement is reported as taking place on our right, for which we are all prepared.

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Major-General GIBBON:

The obstructions in the river will be laid to-night where they were before. I will send you immediately two 100-pounder Parrots to cover the obstructions. They are now afloat. Where will you have them landed? Lest you should have no officer to superintend planting them I send and officer up with the guns to attend to it. You can send him back with the boat do not require him.

In the Field, January 24, 1865-5.05 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

There is no place on side the river where guns can be placed to command the obstructions. One might go to Fort Brady to replace one disabled to-day, and the other at Crow's Nest Battery; but it will be a work of some days to get them into position. In both cases they would be landed at Varina, and I would recommend they be placed in position there first to aid in defense of the river at that point.

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
