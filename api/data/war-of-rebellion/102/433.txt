Lieutenant F. A. McDONALD,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, East Sub-District of the Plains:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I have just received a letter from U. S. Indian Agent Major R. W. Furnas, at the Omaha Agency, stating that a party of five Winnebago Indians fired at the mail-carrier as he was crossing the Omaha Reserve. Colonel Furnas sent a posse of his organized Indian police to arrest the guilty parties, but they were not able to make the arrest. He therefore calls upon me for a detachment of troops to assist him in making the arrest. I start with the required detachment for the Omaha Agency, twenty-eight miles distant, at daylight to-morrow morning, and will report to you promptly what I shall have done.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. JACKSON,

Captain, First Battn. Nebraska Vet. Cav., Commanding Post Dakota.
