My loss is estimated at 75 killed and 200 wounded; chifly in Wright's division. All are not yet collected, as the assault continued until after dark. Prisoners are still coming in; they will probably exceed a thousand.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy's brigade is still down and under our control. I have sent for Colonel Spaulding, commanding the bridge train. I think we can throw a bridge across at Norman's Ford. We have 1,100 prisoners. Had not the escort better be increased? Dispatch of 9.30 received. Yes, the enemy occupy those heights in force, so General Sykes reports.

I have just received the following information through a deserter: General Lee is not with his command, but gone south. Has been gone a week. Early's division moved to Fredericksburg. Rodes' upon Brandy Station.

The enemy attempted to burn the bridge this morning. I think they will leave. Pickets are forming across the river. Wright is watching to open on them. In the event of getting the works on the other side I shall throw another bridge over. Shall I order up my brigade from Norman's Ford?
