SPEECH OF MR. NISBEr,
OF GEORGIA,
Inthe House of RepresentaUxes, August 11, ISil—On the
bill to establish a uniform system of bankiuptcy throughout
the United States
Mr Chairman The people of the immediate community
which I lepre&eut beiu0 greatly mteiested in this bill, k became
my duty to examine the subject caiefuliy That examination
has resulted in a determination to vote for it I shal i give v. ou,
as compact¡y as I can, and briefly, the reasons upon which that
determination reste
It is not unknown to this committee that, from the earliest
days of the Government, efforts have been made o pa«s laws
on the subject ofbdnkiupu.y D unrig every Administra!ion
they have been continued and have been more jr Je^s sun esa
ful Bills have passed, arid, ¡or want of wisdom m the pian or
time for the experiment, or from causes meiely paitism, have
been repealed It may be assumed that no sufficient expen-
ment has been yet made And the past history of bmkrnpt
legislation, therefore, proves nothing against this bill Atdif
ferent periods in the history of the Government, the best and
greatest men of the nation have urged the establishment of i
uniform system of bankiuptcv Oft-, i h is the agency of Con
gressgbeen invoked, yes, sir, invoked by the voice of thou°ands
for relief, and to give them the means of enjoying a pnviiege
which the Corstitution concedes And now sir, nc less than
five hundred ti ou and of our fellow citizens aie ¡supplicants. at
your door for the means of exe i ption Aom the despotism of
hopeless insolvency This bill passed the Seriate at its last
s ssion, they have again sent it to us, bearing the smction of
that wise and piudentbod} ¿   Why then, do we hesitate i
It is fortunate foi fio e who are ínteres ed m the passagt of
this bill that it itsth upon a plain an 1 liber d er nt of power m
tie Constitution No one can deny its constitutionality Ihe
power to pass law* on the subject's bioad and an pk—left to
no implication, but expre^'y enumerated We will scaieely,
therefore, meet m out path the goigon abstiaction, who&c
hideous aspect frightens so many men f om thui pioj íiety
Abstraction ' awoid which means any thirgor nothi is- a suits
the game of politicians, wlrch at one time with! old*, al! pne
tical action, and at another grasps the most a'armng poweis
By abstractions 1 mean that system of metanliysicai bubt eties,
said to be diawn fiom the Constitution, which its piofe -,ms
claim to be an infallible rule of political eonduc t, and by
which an ingenious sophist may give a plausible excuce lor
denying to Congiess almost any enumerated powei, and civ ing
to the States almost any that is prohibited to them Upon this
subject, I say, sir, the power is so obviously tonlened tint no
one will be found so hardy as to doubt it* ex sfi ce Altow me
here to pause foi one moment to ask you, if it js not piling
strange 'hat, whi'st Congress has been in the exeicise of so
many powers which ire doubtful, ibis one confusedly con
ferred, she should so lnng refuse to pxerfi lint I proceed In
the first article and eignth section of the Constitution it is pro
vided "that Congress sh di have power to establish a uniform
rule of naturalization and uniform laws on the subject of b ink
ruptcies throughout the United States " The powei here con
ferred is over the subject of bankruptcies, andcloth°s Congress
with full legislative discretion as to the chaiactei of the laws,
they shall estabhsi The Constitution gives to Congress the
exercise of a high sovereign attribute, that of arresting, not
withstanding the contract, the power of the creditoi over the
person and subsequent means of the debtoi Bankruptcy, in
its technical meaning, cannot exist m the absence of contracts
When, therefoie, Congiess is clothed with power ovei. the sub
ject of bankruptcies, it theieby necessarily acquues powei
over contracts Thete is but one limitation to the power, and
that is this the laws established by virtue of the giant must be
uniform Any laws whicTi Congress may ta=supon this sub
ject,notconflicting with other provisions of the instiument, if
uniform, will be constitutional
It is contended by some that, under this clause of the Consti
tution, Congress can establish but one svstem of bankrupt
laws, because by bankruptcies is meant the English system
Theframers of the instiument had thatsystem only in view,
and we are limited to that or none That svstem being wholly
unsmted to our people, they hen e derive an argument against
this bill Thisisa touch of abstraction Now this construc-
tion is repelled by the generality and breadth of the terms used
The power is not to establish a system now or then in esse,
but laws, such as the wants of the people and the genius of our
Government would makeappiopnate, which laws are subject
to modification and to repeal And the rower is not over
bankrupt liws, but over the subject matter of such laws
Why does not the word bankruptcies refer to the bankrupt sys
tern of France, of Holland, or of an v other countrv, as well as
to that of England? It may Besides, sir, how unwise would
have been the authors of the Constitution to have required for
the States—for a Federal Republic—the bankrupt bystem of a
monarchy
In my judgment the construction adverted to i= insulting to
the memory of the pui e and able men who achieved om inde-
pendence and framed our Government No, sir, the creditor
and also ihe debtor has privilege  under the Constmuiwn
For, according to the views I here present, Congress has the
power to authorize both voluntary and compulsory bankrupt
pies, one for the creditor's advantage, the other for the benefit
Bankrupt BUI—Mr, JVisbet.
of the debtor    Congress his powei, in o hei words, to esta
blish both bankiupt and insolvent laws
Su, according to my senseof our obbga'ions as members of
Congrp-, , in cases where the Constitution confeis right*, upon
the citip^n, to be enjoyed only througn our legislation, it is
our duty to legislate at once Ihe Constitution is mmdatory
Think you that it wasnrtexpee ed by the people, mil by then
d^'egatesm the convention that this powei should be made
efficacious by immediate testation? If it was not desisrud
to be exercised, tucn it wdi. an act of folly or of weakness to
grant it rheiei* on-1 puvikge of the citizen confeired by
anothei clmseof the Constitution, which has not been and
cannot be fully enjoyed until Congress «hill estal lish umfoim
bankrupt laws The second section of the fouith article of
the Constitution declaies 'The citizens of each ^tafe tahalí be
entitled to all thepnvileges and immunities of cmrens in the
sevciai States ' Now su, the States having the power to en
act msu vent laws binding of course withm then own junsdic
tion only, and tho^e of each vaiymg perhaps Aom ail the rest,
thQoiisens of no one State enjoy the puvileges and immum
ties of those of the several States A citizen of Geugu enti
tied to be dischaiged at home may bebible toaneit in New
"i oik, whilst the citizens of New York ue themselves dis
charged by the laws of that State
Thus sir you peiceive that you withhold fiom the people
otbei constitutional rights, so long as you withhold a umfoim
svstemof bankruptcy liy whatauthoiu} do you <*o withhold

iarges the remedies of the creditor undei his contris The
condition of discharge is the surrender of all ihp pfFee of the

contend with other cieditors for priority of hen, fbht against
a signments hands, iemo\als and, peihaps, at last lose his
monev Tln->, then, is an enlargement of the lemedies of the
creditor and, when we consider how frequent are the convey-
ances to defeat creditors—how universal the habit of prefernng
one to another, the securing of that clas& of ct editors in mer
canille phrase called coafi lential, it mu^t be admit ed that the
advantage secuied to the creditor is great The provisions of
this bill secure an equal division of the effects of the bankrupt
among all his creditors And what does the ci editor lose?
Why nothimr, sir, but the power to incarcerate his felhw man,
and the light to appropriate his future acquisitions, if, per
chance in a life of suffering, despondency, and often of crime,
be acqunes any thing at all The insolvent is in most cases a
doomed man Without the benefit of bankrn ptcy he can ne^ er
pay, with it he often rises, and, from impulses of honor, dis
charges all his liabilities After all, sir, does not the con'ract
remain obligatory inmora's m honor, m gratitude? There is
nnpenaltvor other prohibition against the credi'oi receiving
ail his dues The law only demes to the Jew his round of
flesh, hi=< barbarousremedy, his revolting power of imprison
merit and hen bondage, his right to crush beneath his remorse
less heel the head and heart of his victim The English bank
luptlnws have all taken effect tnpresent^ and in all the books

determined? Both the couits and the p ofcssion ia\eacqm
ebced in their constitutionality in my own State, the right of

the debtnt to what we call jail 1 mils I never heard thecoraui

I live is young, of favorable location to trade, and holding apo-

land and traveise the sea—give wing to their ardent entei prt^e
—and, my word for it, in most cases, they will pav their debts,
and enrich the S ate by the creation of capital Viewing this
subject in the light of political economy, the public will be great
gamers by discharging the bankrupt, because thereby you
throw into activity a large amount of intellectual and profes-
sional capital which others jse would be forever lost How
many men who become insolvent, and fail to compound, pay
their dsbts1 Not one in fifty This fact should satisfy creditoia
that they lose nothing b) this bill.   The debtor loses with hig
