COLONEL: I have the honor to transmit you exhibit of men furnished by Iowa for three-months" term of service (4,816), for which as yet the State has not been allowed credit. All the men raised for the term of one and two years, except drafted and substitutes, have been heretofore reported on the regular monthly exhibits forwarded from this office.

In addition to the 4,816 three-months" men now reported, the State has furnished men for which no credit has been given,as follows:

Not allowed on report of July 30, 1865...................... 779

Not allowed reported from this office from October 1, 1864,

to May 20, 1865............................................. 172

Not allowed men in Wisconsin regiments..................... 100

Not allowed men in Dakota regiments........................ 16

Not yet reported to your office:

Men in Illinois regiments.................................. 465

Men in Kansas regiments.................................... 186

Men in Nebraska regiments.................................. 177

-----

Total three-years" men....................................1,895

Total two-years" men embraced in reports of January,

February,and March, 1864................................... 5

One-years" men reported from October 1, 1864, to May 20,

1865, not yet acknowledged................................7,495

This statement is based on the assumption that all the men acknowledged by your Department were counted as for three-years" term, and is exclusive of drafted men and substitutes, which class has not yet been reported to this office by the acting assistant provost-marshal-general of the State. I have the honor to request that the necessary instructions may be issued directing such a report furnished with a view to completion of the records of this office and a final adjustment of quotas and credits.

With great respect, I have the honor to be, truly, yours,

N. B. BAKER,

Adjutant-General of Iowa.
