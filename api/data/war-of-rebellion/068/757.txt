BEVERLY HOUSE, May 14, 1864-7.50 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My men are nearly all in the position that I wish them. My strength is increasing all the time by the arrival of those who lost their way or fell back. Strength present: General Griffin, 2,500; General Cutler, 1,500; General Crawford, not known; Colonel Kitching, 1,000; total 5,000. My men encountered only cavalry in the attack on the house south. The force southwest from here remains in its place. I understand you can see all I can.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that the attack be suspended to-day. You will conceal your troops as much as possible, but throw out your skirmishers well and learn everything you can of the position and force of the enemy. General Wright, as I have already advised you, has sent a brigade to the house on your left from which the enemy's battery was driven.

The major-general commanding has directed General Hancock to withdraw your pickets as well as General Wright's and send them to you. Captain Adams should be withdrawn at the same time.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Some one here tells me that Captain Adams was not on our right, but is now on our left. Is that so?
