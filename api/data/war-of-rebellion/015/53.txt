Question by General McDOWELL. Lay before the court Special Orders, Numbers 65, and paragraph 2, General Orders, Numbers 10, Headquarters Department of the Rappahannock.

Answer. The order is recorded in the general-order book, page 116, and special-order book, page 135, submitted to the court.

The record read the order, as follows:
SPECIAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Numbers 65. Opposite Fredericksburg, Va., May 13, 1862.

In visiting this afternoon the graves of those who fell in the advance on this place the major-general commanding was pained at seeing that in paying a tribute of respect to their companions some of the men of his command had despoiled a neighboring tomb-that of a woman. Such conduct is undoubtedly to be ascribed to nothing worse than thoughtlessness; yet know thoughtless to pay respect to the dead of to-day by a desecration of the dead of yesterday. Can the graves of these brave men be respected hereafter when it is seen that their friends have not respected that of her who sleeps beside them?

Brigadier-General Augur will detail a party of bricklayers and others, and will obtain the necessary materials for fully restoring the tombs which have been injured, and will at the same time have suitable head-pieces placed over the graves of our men, giving full names, residence, company, and regiment, and inclose the little cemetery neatly and substantially.

By command of Major-General McDowell:

SAML. BRECK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
