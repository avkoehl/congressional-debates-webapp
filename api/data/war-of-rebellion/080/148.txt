HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 30, 1864-8 a.m.

General MEADE:

General Turner, in my front, reports that the only place I can get out of the line is opposite the crater. It is already full of men who cannot develop. I shall put in my column as soon as I can. It is impossible, by reason of the topography, to charge in the manner you indicate. I must go in by head of column and develop to the right. This is reply to orders from General Meade to push for crest of hill regardless of General Burnside's troops. General Ames makes similar reports.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
