CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

March 12, 1862.

The PRESIDENT:

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the estimates of the War Department for the term of eight months, from the 1st of April, 1862, to the 1st of December, 1862, in accordance with the resolution of Congress:

First. For the Quartermaster's Department. . . . . . . . $195,271,748,00

Second. For the Commissary-General's Department. . 39,826,415. 00

Third. For the Ordnance service in all its

branches. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,500,000. 00

Fourth. For the Medical Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,015,000. 00

Fifth. For the Adjutant and Inspector General's

Bureau. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10,000. 00

Sixth. For the Engineer service in all its

branches. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,000,000. 00

Seventh. For compensation of the Secretary of

War and all officers, clerks, messengers, and

watchmen in the War Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80,000. 00

Eighth. For incidental and contingent expenses

of the Army and of the Department of War. . . . . . . . . 200,000. 00

Ninth. For compensation of the Commissioner of

Indian Affairs, his chief clerk, and the

contingent expenses of his office from the 1st of

March, 1862, to the 1st of December, 1862. . . . . . . . 4,000. 00

Tenth. For amount payable to certain Indian

tribes under treaty stipulations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 371,000. 00

Eleventh. For pay of superintendents and agents

of Indians and incidental and contingent

expenses of these agencies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18,264,28

------------------

Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 256,296,888. 58

The foregoing is the amount required according to the estimates of the chiefs of bureaus, as herewith submitted, but after careful revision I believe that a considerable reduction may be made. I feel the more confidence in my own judgment of the amount necessary to conduct the business of the Department and the operations of the war from the fact that at a former session a similar reduction was submitted as the result of my own examination of the estimates, and the event justified the reduction then made. It is deemed safe, therefore, to reduce the appropriations as follows, viz:

That for the Quartermaster-General to. . . . . . . . . . . . . . $155,000,000

That for the Commissary-General to. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29,000,000

That for the Ordnance Bureau to. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,000,000

That for the Medical Bureau to. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,400,000

That for the Engineer service to. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,800,000

On the basis of this reduction the whole amount of appropriation required for this Department for the eight months would be $199,833,725. 58.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
