The tabular statement of the Auditor, marked
No. 3, exhibitsin detail the receipts from and the
expenditures in the post offices in all the Slates
during the fiscal year, together with the amount
paid, and reported to be due, to contractors for
the transportation of the mails.
No. 4 presents a similar exhibit for the disloyal
States alone,with astatementof the wholeamount
of " transportation" accrued therein, which in-
cludes not only the amount actually paid, but also
the cost of the scrvicc known to have been per-
formed, payment for which is withheld, and the
additional amount which would he due on the
assumption that the postal service was uninter-
rupted until discontinued by the Postmaster Gen-
eral.
ESTIMATES FOR 1862.
The estimates of receipts and expenditures for
the fiscal year ending- June 30, 1862, and of the
resulting deficiency for the same year, which were
submitted 111 the last annual report from this De-
partment, were based on the existence of postal
service throughout the Union.
Should such service remain suspended, during
the year, in States where it is now wholly or
partially discontinued, the estimated deficiency of
$5,210,426 63 would bo reduced to $2,747,000,
according to the ratio of receipts and expenditures
in that section in 1860.
The amount appropriated by the third section
of the act approved March 2,1861, to supply de-
ficiencies in the revenue for the year 1862, was
$5,391)350 63; and, if the cost of a daily mail on
the central route is to be paid out of the resources
of this Department, there will be an unexpended
balance of this appropriation July 1, 1863, of
about one million six hundred thousand dol-
lars.
Sections nine and eleven of the act approved
March 2, 1861, (chapter seventy-three,) seemed
clearly to authorize this payment out of the Treas-
ury for mail service six times a week on the cen-
tral route to California. But the word " daily,"
used in the eleventh section, in connection with
the appropriation, has induced the adoption of a
different construction at the Treasury.
ESTIMATE OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES FOR
1863.
Expenditures.
For transportation of the mails inland $6,961,000
For compen.-auon of postmasters  2,234,000
For cleik^ of post offices  846,000
For ship, steamboat, and way letters  12,000
For office furniture lor post offices  2,000
For advertising  ,16,000
For mail bags  75,000
Foi paper for blanks  50,000
For punting blanks  12,000
For wiappmgpaper  45,000
For mail locks, keys, and stamps  56,000
For mail depredations and special agents  75,000
For miscellaneous payments  187,000
For postage stamps arid stamped envelopes  90,000
For payments of balances due to foreign coun-
tries    230,000
Foi payment of letter-carriers  352,000
To the above estimate must be added
the cost of transportation of "foreign
mails," which was formerly paid out of
the appropriation of the fifth section of the
act approved June 14. 1858, but which
the Secretary of the Treasury, on the
11,063,000
6th of August, 1801, decided not to be
payable therefrom, since the passage of
the act of June 15, 1860.
Estimate for the Transportation of Foreign Mails
for 1883.
Between New York, Southampton, and other
European ports  285,000
Between New York, Ciueenstown, and Liver-
„ pool  50,000
Between Portland and Liverpool, and Quebec
and Liveipool  80,000
Between United States, Havana, Cuba, and
other West India ports   50,000
11,528,000
The estimate for the transportation of
the mails inland does not include the sum
of $1,000,000, which it was presumed that
Congress intended to appropriate from
the Treasury by the ninth section of the
act of March Q, 186'l,for a daily mail on
the central route; but by a decision ofthe
First Comptroller of the Treasury, dated
October 31, 1861, it is declared that this
sum was not thus appropriated.
Unless, therefore, a specific appropriation for
this object be made by Congress, the above es-
timates will be subjcct to a lurther addition of.. 1,000,000
Expenditures for 1863   12,528,000
Means for 1863.
The gross revenue for the year 1863, including
foreign postages, fees paid In by letter-carriers,
and miscellaneous receipts, is estimated at an
increase of lour per cent, on the revenues of
1861, making  8,683,000
Estimated deficiency of revenue, compared with
estimated expenditures  3,845,000
Deduct appropriations made by the acts of March
3, 1847, and March 3, 1851, for carrying free
mail matter  700,000
Which would make the whole amount estimated
to be required from the Treasury for 1863 $3,145,000
exclusive of the earnings of the Department for
carrying free matter under the acts of March 3,
1847, and March 3, 1851, (#700,000.)
The estimate of the total expenditures for 1863
is somewhat less than those for previous years
heretofore submitted. This difference arises from
the fact that only partial estimates are made for
the cost of postal service in States where it is now
suspended.
It is assumed that the restoration of such ser-
vice in these States will take place gradually, and
that in the process many expensive mail routes,
from which but little revenue has been derived,
may be curtailed or discontinued.
JVlost of the estimates for expenditures in the
disloyal States for 1863 are calculated at a fixed
proportion of the amount expended in that sec-
tion of the country under the various heads of
appropriation while its relations to this Depart-
ment were undisturbed, which amount was about
one quarter of the expenditure for the whole
Union.
The estimates for blanks and wrapping paper
are nearly the same as in former years, as in case
of the resumption of postal service m the disloyal
States a large quantity of blanks, wrapping paper,
and other supplies furnished by blank agents
would undoubtedly be required, as the post offices
within the limits of these States would be entirely
without such supplies.
For the reasons stated below, there has been no
diminution in the estimates for the cost of mail
bags, locks and keys, for the year 1863.
Since the discontinuance of the postal service
in eleven States of the Union, the expenditure for
mail bags has been greater than during any cor-
responding period of the preceding year. The
causes are as follow:
1. The abstraction in those States, immedi-
ately preceding open rebellion, of considerable
quantities of mail bags from the general supply in
circulation on the principal routes between the
North and the South, by withholding, in disre-
gard of an established rule, the return of extra
bags, which, by the course and exchanges of mail
matter, always accumulate in the southern States,
and by exchanging, and sending back with the
