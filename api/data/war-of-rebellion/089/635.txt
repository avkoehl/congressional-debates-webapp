Major Michler to go with me in person over the lines that he had selected as I should desire before commencing them, for as far as I can judge of what is needed it would appear to me that a line, of the ground permits it, that would run more nearly direct from Fort Porter to his last large redoubt might answer the purpose and save over one-third the distance or labor.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
