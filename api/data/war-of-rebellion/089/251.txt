HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY,October 16, 1864-7 p. m.

Captain JONH B. MAITLAND,

Asst. Adjt. General, Second Brigadier, Second Div., Cavalry Corps:

CAPTAIN: In obedience to orders received from Colonel Smith, I directed Captain Snyder to take his squadron and move down the plank road to the Proctor house and find out what force was in that vicinity. He found no pickets on his way out, but a heavy blockade just this side of the force in the hollow. It was dark when [he] arrived there, and he went no farther. On his return, soon after he had passed the road, leading off to the right, he was attacked by a small party coming in on that road. Several shots were exchanged, but no casualties. He reports no indications of a large force in that vicinity.

Respectfully, yours,

J. K. ROBISON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry.
