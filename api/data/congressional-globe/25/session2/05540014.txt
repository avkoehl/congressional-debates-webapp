disregard every sound principle oi legislation, of
justice, and morality
Mr N said he believed that the banks heie and
elsewhere ought to be coerced to fulfil their obliga-
tions to the public Will )ou wait to see it the}
■will not voluntarily come forward like honest men,
and agree to pay their debts' Has not this " expe
riment' been already tried, and failed? Have not
these institu'.ons been indulged m their voluntary,
illegal, and immoral coarse foi six or eight months'?
and who can say when they will resume specie
payments now, any better than he could the very
day they suspended'
But it is said the banks cannot resume in this
District unlebs those in the adjoining States also
resume, and we are called on to await the action of
the States This is a no\el doctrine, recentl\ pio-
mulgated, and piesents a new and important iea-
n - m our banking sjstem It had been supposed
llrtabank, like any other business cotporatiun,
was an isolated institution, bound bv the principles
of Us charter, and subject to the control, and alone
accountable, to the authority to which it was in-
debted for its existence But it appears that this
is all a mistake, that the banks are all associated
together, and form a distinct totiimi nwenllh, or
political dynasty, governed by th'ii own luis
Having openly *et at delnnci tin 1 iw* ol the
States wheie thej exist, the) lnu umii riaken to
make laws foi themselves and have lecentlv laid
a sort ot Bank Parliament, to "regulite tht cur-
rency," and to decide the nnpoitant question when
it would be reasonable anl txptdient lor them to
pay their debit, The result ol this dehbeiation is
well known, they ha\e not only tesolved to peisisl
in their bankruptcy, but had the audacity to decide
that they would not even liv. on a luture day when
they would begin to pay their debts And with
these proceedings staring us m die ¡<ui., ire we to
be called on to wait the aeiion ol the banks?
But, Mr N. said, he protested against the prm-
cipld that the banks of this Distiict, or that the
banks of a particular State, weie to be conliollod
by the banks of any other State What i* this,
principle but a subversi ->n of tht law s and luilinriiv

stitutions 'o a foieign powci—to in ilien influence''
Whether this control proccccKliom inothu Male or
from a loit^ri countij, is 11 little corisi queue e, the
principle is the \me II the 1 inks 11 on St Hi ire

mately conne"ted with the Bank of England, and
equally liable to be ufnctud by the coutsc'of action

tical consequence of uniting the bants ot the
country together into a jemt stock concern? Is it
not to render the whole of ihem subject to the con-
trol of a fe v of ihe large? institutions in our princi-
pal cities—peilnps subject the wh< le to the control
of a single institution1 Hi believed tint bmks
like all other locil institutions siU)iil 11 e snhj et to
the exclusive regulation and contiol of the aulhi
nty that cieated them, and that, as recatéis the
banks in this District, it i the duty of C on^rcss to
decide when they can, and ought to, redeem their
bills and pay their debts In determining this ques-
tion, it was. no doubt proper to look at the whole
subject, the condition of the currency generally in
the country, the state of the exchanges, and the
ability of the banks lo resim e business on correct
and honest punciples He would look aifach, and
be influenced by them, but would discountenance
the legislation of banks, and all alien influence
The banks of this District cannot rightfully be
controlled by those of other States they are under
the jurisdiction of Congress alone they are not to
be "regulated" m their action by the legislation of
a dynasty of associated banks Such a principle,
whether applied to the banks oí the District or the
local institutions of a Stale, is subversive of State
soveieigmj, of all law, and of every sound princi-
ple Heregaided this question as important only
for the pmciple involved, and from its general
bearing on the condition of the country in regard to
lite-currency.   He had no wish that any couise
should be adopted that would be oppressive and
injurious to the people of the District, and had no
objection lo fix a day for the restoration ol the cur-
renc y of the District, so far ahead as to render it
perfectly safe and easy for the banks to return to
bound principles, and to an honest course of busi-
ness But it was for Congress to say when that
time would come, he was not willing to refer the
question to the banks of Philadelphia, or any othei
city He was opposed to the combined power of
banks, and to their concerted movements
What are the difficulties in the way of the banks
speedily resuming? When this question was un-
der consideration at the late session, it was claimed
that the subject was involved in so much doubt
and uncertainty, that we could not safely fix any
time when the banks could íesume payment Now
we have an entirely different state of thing* I
avail myself (said Mr N ) of this opportunity to
congratulate the Senate and the country, on the
happy results which have followed the w í'-e anil
judicious measures adopted at ths late session of
Congress The effect of those measures had been
astonishing, and wholly unexampled in tht history
of this, or any other country It is but linee
months since we assembled heie, uneki ettraoreli-
narv eucuinstances, a great calamity, or what was
so regarded, had suddenly fallen upon the count] j,
in the midst ot prolound peace, and of apparent
success, the prosperity of the country was struck
down at a blow A terrible explosion hid take
place, and all the great interests of the country
vverepiostrated by it Money suddenly all vanish-
ed, foieign exchange rose to nearly twenty-five
per cent and specie to ten or twelve per cent and
bank paper, worthless as it was, could not be
had All business was at a stand, the wheels of
commerce hat! stopped , the meichant shut up his
shop, tht manufacturer dismissed his hands, and
shutdown Ins ¿ates, the méchame was without cus-
tomers, and the laborer without employment, it not
without bread Men looked silently at each other,
as they passed in the streets, and spoke not, the
whole country wis mantled in gloom and despon-
dency, and a deep impiession seemed to pievail,
that as the batiks had inlet!, tinivetsal bankrupey
was to lollow,spitadingruin and desolation far and
wiele
Such wis the condition of the country, as evlu-
bited by the panic orators, on the assembling oj
( ingress, who immediately raisvd the cry ol einfms
anil iiiitt and c elled foi mcistiicsol rrhrj The
Government and the public fieasitry, were of no
consequence What if the Treisury veis empty,
and the banks and the mttenants did refuse lo pay
theit debts' Of what consequence was this Thegrett
object was to help the banks and the mere ham ,
and 10 relieve the people—the pool suiTciing di"
tressed and ruined people Well, measures were
pioposed, intended to relieve the Treasury anil
the country, but they were opposed, because
they were not calculated to afTeitet the ne-
cessity re lief ti> the people Bui, with one excep-
tion, thee measures were adopled And what
we re the}? They consisted in stibstituti )g the cre-
dit ol the United Sutes for the capital or credit of
the banks and merchants, who were the debtors of
the Government The freasuiy had ample re-
sources, but, to make thxm available, would have
pressed haul on the public debtors, and thus in-
cteised thei general money pressuie To avoid
this, the Government agieed to forbeai to collect
its debts, and to use its own credit, which is better
than the credit of all the banks in the Union This
substitution of the credit of the United States for
the dues of the Government, was, m its immediate
effect, equivalent to the creation of so much capi-
tal, as it permitted the large sum of ftorn four to
five millions, due from the merchants, and eight 01
nine millions due from the banks, to remain m the
hands of the citizens, as private capital, its place
being supplied by the credit of the United Mates
And what have been the effects of these wise and
healing measures' Let the present condition of
the country answer' Where is the distress now?
Where are the dark clouds that lowered over the
eeiuntiy' Scattered and gone, all gone And
where are the panic orators, the heralds, who, fiom
these halls, proclaimed and spread through the
land, from Maine to Arkansas, th* saddening notes
of their country's ruin? Are these heralds of wo-
ful tidings silent? He had not yet heard from them
here, yet they had, some of them, been heard from
elsewhere, but they have changed their notes, and
struck up a new tune—lively, joyous, and animated
The sudden tide of prosperity which has rushed in,
tike a flood, upon us, has revived the drooping spi-
rits of those who were most distmsed, and rendered
them frantic with joy I ¿gain ask, said Mr. N.
where is the distress? Shall we look for it in the
commercial cities North and East, where it pre-
vailed most, where the complaints were deepest
and loudest? Sir, we should look in vain the
scene is changed, the cues of distress,the weepings
and wailtngsare all changed into songs of joy and
shouts of triumph Those recently distressed ci-
ties, which, like the cities of old, were so lately
clothed in sackcloth and ashes, have since been
filled with feastmgs and rejoicings, illuminations,
the roar of cannon, public meetings for general
congratulation, and the expression, by speeches and
resolutions, of the strong and overflowing feelings
of joy, are among the signs of the times that the
distress has past off, and been succeeded by unex-
ampled ptcispertty
How sudden, how astonishing the change1 How
rapidly, almost instantaneous, the country has re-
covered from a state of distress and ram1 Such
have been the happy fruits of the wise and judi-
cious measmes of the ¡ate session. The country
has been íelieved, its dormant energies revived,
and its wonted prosperity restored Does any one
doubt that these qhanges have proceeded from the
measures of the late session? We were then told
that the national prosperity depended alone on the
action of Congress, that «redit and general confi-
dence could not be íestored but by Congress, and
that it was in vain to look for the leturn ofvhe
prosperuj of the country, until Congress adopted
measures to bring about such a result If Congress
alone had the power to restore the general prosperi-
ty, it is conclusive that the bright aspect our affairs
have assumed, must have pioceeded from the wise
and piudent measures recommended by the Presi-
dent and cairied out by Congress
Mr President, let us all rejoice at the returning
prosperity of the country' Let us rejoice that the
days of the distress are pasl, that the panic is gone,
and that the sounds of joy and gladness are again
heard m our borders' The panic has answered its
purpose, its end and aim have been accomplished,
it woi keel well lor a season, it helptd out the elec-
tions admitably, but they are through for the year,
the "experiment" has worked well, and accom-
plished iLs object, but let no one think it can be
prolonged When the people are prosperous and
happy they feel it and will speak out from the
fulness of th  heart the mouth speaketh These 
public demonstrations of joy in all our commercial
cities—the illuminations, the filing of cannon, and
other public demonstrations of rejoicing, mean
something They speak a language which cannot
be misunderstood, nor misinterpreted They prove
that the distress is over, that money has become
plenty, that commeice has revived, that business is
restoied to its usual activity With such evidences
as these of the general prosperity, he trusted that
we should hear no more of the cuckoo notes of dis-
tre s, or of the scarcity of money, or other evils of
the   limes
Such art- the results of wise legislation, the mea-
su res of the extra session had an instantaneous effect,
they immediately reduced the price of foreign and
domestic exchange, and specie fell at once from
eight or ten to five per cent , exchange from twenty-
two to sixteen or thereabouts, and has gone on im-
proving until foreign exchange is two or three per
cent below par, and domestic exchange more regu-
lar and favorable than it has been for many years
heretofore, that on New Orleans had fallen from
fifteen per cent to one and a half, and would soon
be at par He had attributed these results to the
late measures as a fair deduction flora the premises
and reasonings of others, in his own opinion, other
causes had operated, and he had never considered the
country as entirely rumed, or the people as really
in a state of suffering in consequence of the general
failure of the banks.
