HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864-8.15 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

There is as yet nothing important to note. Generals Miles and Gregg are advancing up the Charles City road. The enemy were driven from behind Deep Creek and are falling back toward White's Tavern. I do not think I will push the reconnaissance much farther than White's Tavern until I hear from General Birney, who has swung into the left and is advancing toward the Central road. He reports a line of the enemy's works well filled, and is moving to the right to see if he can turn the flank. He will attack if there is a good opening. The enemy's lines along the heights behind Bailey's Creek appear about as yesterday.

General MEADE:

At 8 a.m. our troops on Charles City road were driving the enemy, our advance being within one mile of White's Tavern. Brigadier-General Chambliss was killed and his body fell into our hands. Our loss is not considerable yet. Colonel Gregg is wounded, but not seriously.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864.

General GRANT:

One prisoner from Sanders' brigade reports that the other brigades of Mahone's division were ready to come. General Gregg found a valuable map on General Chambliss' body, which I will send you when it comes. It is said to have the enemy's line marked on it.
