their legitimate duties. The organization of a regiment of Marylanders not liable to service would be very acceptable, but I should not recommend them to be used with heavy artillery on the Potomac, as I do not think they could maintain their positions there. They would certainly provoke attack, and might induce a destructive expedition into the Northern Neck of Virginia.

Secretary.

[Third indorsement.]

OCTOBER 19, 1864.

So much of the plan as proposes to raise a regiment of Marylanders from men not in the servcie, and who do not owe service, and who do not owe service to the Confederate States, is approved. To arm them as heavy artillery would defeat the object in view, as they would then necessarily remain with an army by which they could be supported, heavy artillery being least of all arms qualified for separate operations. Either for the special service indicated or for service with other troops, according to their character, I would be glad to have such a regiment as is described within.
