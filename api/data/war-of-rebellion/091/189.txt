CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. DETACHMENT NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS, September 27, 1864.

This command will be ready move at 5 a. m. to-morrow. By order of Brevet Major-General Emory:

DUNCAN S. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., September 27, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Both of my last courier parties were attacked by rebel cavalry; dispersed part of them, capturing the first party at Strasburg, the second at a point between Charlestown and Bunker Hill. Message No. 31 was sent by both parties, and both have failed. I shall try another duplicate to-night. The country between this and Sheridan yesterday and to-day seemed to be alive with parties of rebel guerrillas and cavalry. Last night they attacked ambulances, with escort of seventeen men, between this and Charlestown; severely wounded surgeon of Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry. I doubt if we shall be able to get any dispatches through without sending much larger body of cavalry than I can get hold of. I have but small force for such duty, and it is badly worn down.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., September 27, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Reports from wagon-tram of 500 wagons en route for front received. All right two miles beyond Charlestown; ought to make Bunker Hill to-night. I complain of the manner in which stragglers, recruits, convalescents, &amp;c., are sent forward from Camp Distribution. Eight hundred men were sent last night in charge of one officer. The consequence is there is short on arrival 132 men. The object of officers in as large numbers as possible. They arrive here generally in the night and without sufficient officers to take care of them. All who wish to get away. It is bey day for bounty-jumpers, and unless remedied all rascals who are recruited and sent here will escape.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, W. VA., September 27, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Sheridan was at Harrisonburg on the 25th at 4 a. m. Our cavalry reported to be six miles in advance. A train has just arrived here with 7,000 stand of captured arms and ten pieces of artillery and five caissons. Eighty prisoners came with the train.

THOS. H. NEILL,

Brigadier-General.
