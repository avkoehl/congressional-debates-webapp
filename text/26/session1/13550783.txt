Independent Treasury—Mr. Sergeant.
H. of Reps.
Treasury, nor in the Treasury circulation Nay, mors than
tab that the rsry circumstances which oppress, disastrously
eppress, the business of the country in all its branches, may, as
lhe\ now actually do, turn to the advantage of the office hold-
are. Thus, there is not only a want ol sympathy, but an actual
tncl unceasing conflict between their concerns; when every man
hum admit that they ought to be identical, so that at the Ti-ea
sarv, and in the Government, ihere should be aqmck and lively
sensibility to whatever injuriously affects the people W uhout
this, we must always experience n hat we have experienced for
thelast three years, a careless indifference in the Government
to the distresses 01 the people, and a cold hearted neglect of the
mean* ot giving relief
The office* of the Government m tact cease to be a part of the
Maple, and acquire interests of their own, drectly oppose J to
t!w common interests. The family compact la thus perverted,
and an approximation made to Governments of an entirely dif
(«rent e'iaracter. The practice of such Governments proves
nothing Still, what has been assumed in regard to them is not
true In the island of Cuba, for examble, any one who will look
lato HaM*rd*s Register, at page414, will find that the currency
snd c reulatwn are in a condition ot extreme disorder Worn
and depreciated com of inconvenient denominations, such as pis
tirten*, are forced in payment, at prices far beyond their real
velus—doubloons have different values. The whole thing is
unjust, inconvenient, and oppressive in its operation The re
medy the people have sought for is a bank, but this, the metro-
politan Government in Spain refuses to allow them; or, which
It equivalent, will grant it only upon terms too onerous to be
scespisd I do not doubt that, if we had time to go into anexa
mutation of the other evidence, we should find the history else-
where to be the same.
This hill destroys, by one of its enactments, the only remain
lug connection of the Traasury with banks, and the only rem
pant of wholesome control it has over them The resol uuon
of the SOU  of April, 1316, makes the notes of specie paying
banks receivable in the payment of public dues This it may
t  admktad, is an insufficient check, not to be compared to that
which would be afforded by a Bank of 'he United States; but
stil! It is a check The Government, by means of it, has the
power to discredit banks that tail to pay specie, and so to aid
toa people in keeping the banks up to their duty. But this act
repeals that resolution, and prohibits the receipt of banknotes
•surely, good or bad. Thus it discredits all banks, instead of dis-
crediting only those who have not done what they ought to do to
isjinn their credit. In this the Government does more than
reflect iu doty, which is to regulate, and support, and provide
for the currency. Its power is here exercised to the contrary.
It destroys, as far as it is able, the distinction between good and
bad banks, and places them all upon a level, when it is o*jvi-
sosly the interest ef ths people that the distinction should be
maintained by all the exertions of both Government and people.
Bull worse, there u a perpetual conflict produced, injurious to
lbs banks, by keeping up a (ontinual, and at the same time, an
uncertain demand upon them for their specie, so that they ne-
ver can know what they may be called on for
The Treasury avoids the obnoxious responsibility of drawing
apeen from the banks, but it compels the people to make the
drafts on the banks, being thus itself tbe secret cause of the
mischief, but putting the odium upon individuals. Why this
war upon the banks'! Tbey are State institutions, authorized
and established by the Legielatures of the States, and luring
every constitutional sanction They are within the States, un
der the protection of the States, and beyond the reach of any di
rest power of the National Government The exercise of such
a power is as plainly denied as if it were expressly prohibited in
lac Constitution. Is it right, thent Is it consistent with the true
jneaning-of the Constitution of the United States? Is it not ,a
Dost wanton and unan'home J abuse of the powers granted, to
employ them indirectly for tbe accomplishment of purposes
which cannot be constitutionally accomplished) Why may not
the Federal Government abuse all its powers in the same way,
and make war upon every State right and State interest? The
right of the Stales to have banks, and the right of the people to
use bank credit in their business, their right so to employ their
capital is just as clear and perfect a right as the right to cultivate
iheearthand to ram from it such products as are deemed most
advantageous Why mdy not tbe Government of the United
States, then, with equal justice, make war upon any other em
pioyroent of capital or industry) Why not employ then powers
to stop the cultivation of cotton or tobacco) or the nianulacture
of couon or wool) This would be a daring invasion of the
rghta of the States and the people; but so is the war upon the
banks. The duty of the Government is to protect and to regulate
them. It has the power to do so The neglect to exercise it
by the Government is the real cause of th ir warfare upon the
banks.
Banks are essentially republican institution*.    They have
grown up every where with the growth of commerce and the
advance of free principles    In these United States they have
beei co-existent wi.b our independence and freedom; and be
lides the men' of this association, it cannot be denied by any one
acquainted with our history that they conulbu'ed poweriu'ly
to secure them    In our colonial state we had no banks    AH
the colonies, findiog credit of some sort necessary, prayed for the
issue of paper money, it was grudgingly and scantily and tar
dlly allowed to them, as if the metropolitan Government had an
injunctive feeling tnatthe use ef credit would invigorate1 the
grown of industry, and hasten the period when this great coon
try would claim to shake off colonial subjection    It could not
be Mtirely denied, and, for want of something better, ail the c 
lintes had recourse to the issue of bills of cred t    Tney are li
able to great and serious objections, asall Government paper is
There is an unrestrained tendency to excess, in the use of Go
vtratnent paper, which never fails to cause its depreciation, and
Often its enure destruction.   Such was the case with our conn
nental money    After gradually exhausting the public eonfi
dence, it finally failed in the year 1779 or 1780    In the midst of
tSewariheGovernment was left without money or credit    At
this critical moment, a lew patrio.lc citizens, from their own
means, established the Bank of North America in tbe city of
Philadelphia—the same which, soon after, was incorporated by
an ordinance of Congress.
Credit revived By the agency of this institu ion funds were
obtained, which the credit of the Government could not com
mand, for the decisive military movement which terminated
the war at Yorktown I have said that tbey are essentially re-
publican institutions I may add, they are, in that respect, pre-
etsery adapted to our condition and to the support of republican
•ouallty. We have few overgrown fortunes. We have few
who art la the opposite extreme of abject poverty.   We have
not, happily, the contrast which is exhibited elsewhere    The
secret of our happiness consists mainly in this
We have, at the same time, full employment for capital, and
it is lurnished by means of banks It is a rare thing to find an
individual among us who is able to establish a bank of his
own The late S ephen Girard was rich enough to employ
a million and a halfol capital in that way; which, at the time
of his death, had increased by the profits to four millions of
dollars
Suppose there had been fifteen hundred people who could
contribute one thousand dollars each to the like purpose, or fif
teen th «usand who could contribute one hundred dollars each,
why would you withhold fiom them the privilege of employing
their capital by union in the same manner as their richer neigh-
bori Would you give the advantage in this respect to the rich?
Surely not The capital of the countiy, in small portions, is
distributed amonta gieat many individuals, in whose hinds it
woul 1 be idle and inactive, producing nothing to themselves or
toothers By cimbimng their means in a bank, they make it
profitable for th mselveeand for the community Their char
ter gives them nothing hut the privilege of thus uniting It
confers upon th m no benefit which each individual does not en-
joy They can have a common seal They can sue and be
sued, and aie subjected to such íestrictionsas the State Legisla-
tures may think fit No monopoly is granted to them On the
contrary, they are permitted to associate in order to counteract
the monopoly of wealth
The history ol banks shows that, under ordinary circum-
stance?, this is their operation.   'I hey are often denounced in
thoughtless and violent declamation as aristocratic institutions
Those who make such charges have not examined into the
matter    They  are essentially   Democratic institutions    Ol
fourteen banks in the city and county of Philadelphia, it ap-
pears from an investigation made a few years ago, that the to
tal  capital  was «14,303,000     The number of  stockhold-
ers was, at the sania tune,  7,112; the average amount of each
stockholder was there ore $fi010—scarcely as muchas the pay
of a member of this House lor a long session, and nothing like
the amount of pay and mileage    Are these stockholders mem-
bers of the aristocracy)   In the Kensington Bank the capital
was 9250,000, the shareholders were 253, the average proprie
tor hip was theiefore less than S<,000    Were these stockhold-
ers members of the aristocracy)   Are they a description of
persons to cause us such fearful alarm, and to deserve such
vehement denunciations)   The smallest proprietorship in the
Bank of England, according to my recollection, is jB500 ster-
ling or «2.500    The stock in our banks is seldom higher than
•100 ashare, and in most of them as low as *50    A small accu-
mulation serves to buy one.   If these bank proprietors be not
formidable for their wealth—and, surely, no sane man will pre-
tend that they are—still less are they to be  dreaded for their
character    In the same mvestization, it was found that, in the
Philadelphia Bank, full one third of the stock was held by the
most helpless poitions of society—by widows and children,
trustees, executors, and benevolent societies    No doubt the
proportion would b^ found the same in the other banks, and in
some of them even greater    Such people are not tobe feared
They do not deserve to be denounced    They ought to be sup
ported aad protected    It is inhuman to make war upon them
Their little portion is the representative of their own, or their
parents' industry, or the little puree collected  f >r objects of
charity, and has a just claim to our most sacred regard    Such
is the aristocracy of the capital of these State banks    Is its
employment aristocratic)   The  money thus accumulated  is
lent to the mdustr ous and enterprising to help them m their
lawful pursuits, and to encourage exertion for placing them
selves ma state of independent comfort    Whatever it may be
the fashion m these days to say of credit, Dr   Franklin,  who
had passed through every grade in life, from a humble prin-
ter's boy to the highest elevation, knew full well the value of
credit to an industrious young man.   He knew its value to a
community    Besides inciting upon it in his writings, he re
membered it emphatically in his will.   He left two legacies
on3 to the city of Philadelphia, and the other to the city of Bos-
ton, of money to be lent out to young mechanics    This act has
always been regarded as a proof of his wisdom and benevo-
lence    Is this an aristocratic employment of moneyl   Is it a
thing to be denounced and declaimed against, and menaced
with destruction)
But, of the present measure, the object and the effect are
plainly to raise the value of money by dimmishine its quanti
ty and at the same time increasing its cost, by substituting an
expensive currency lor one that is cheap This, too, is to be
achieved very rapidly, suddenly—I may say, at once
All who have thought upon this subject have concurred in
opinion that the gradual increase of the quantity, even with the
diminution of value, is favorable to industry, to piosperuy, and
to human happme«s From the first working of the mines on
this continent till qoite lately, this operation was going on, until
at ength, by the increased quanti y of gold and silver used in
coin, its value wis reduced, as computed, to about one fourth
This embrace-, the period n the history of the woild when its
improvement has been the greatest and the steadiest. There is
not time to go into a detailed examination, bnt those who de*ire
to see how much better the condition of man is, how his com-
forts have been increased, his health promoted, and even the
probibili'ies of life enlarged by several years, may find many
of the particulars in Mr McCulloch's statistics of the British
empire All have agreed that the diminution of quantity and
consequent enhancement of the value of money, is injurious
The present is an inauspicious n oment for insisting on an in-
creased n e of eold and silver, for, owing to the disturbances in
the States sotuh of us oi to the falling off of the productiveness
of the Amenci i mines, there has been a great dimirution in the
world of theq lintity above ground Mi Jacob, in his work
up >n this subject, compiled with great care estimates that the
diminution in the period of twenty yeai«, from li>09 to 1829, is
£66,000,000 sterling, being about one sixth of the whole quantity.
II it has eone on at the same rate for the last ten years, you may
add £33 0 0 000 sterlin , whieh will make it one fourth. What
is our proportion in this diminished btate of the gold and silver
of the world)
Leaving these genera! views, however, let us come to those
which are more strictly our own The diminished quantity
and the increased value of money operate upon property, upon
wages, or the p ice of labor, and upon debts, but in very diffe-
rent and even opposite ways it lowers property, it reduces
w iges, and it increases debts An estate which may have been
adequate to pay all the charges upon it, and leave something for
the owner, is unable to discharge its incumbrances; the owner
lias nothing left, aad he is ruined.  It is do fault of his, he had
no reason to expect, no prudence required hirr to foresee, such 
reverse Reverses he might knew he was exposed to, from va-
rious causes, and if they came he must submit to them. But it
could never enter Uis mind that he was going to be ruined by an
act of the Government lie would look to that quarter rather for
aid than for destruction Sudden changes in the currency, of
this sort, by the disorder and obstruction they introduce into all
classes of industry, deprive the poor man of employment, or, if
he i-s able to get it, compel him to work for less But the office
holder, the creditor, and the moneyed capitalist are benefited;
the nominal amount they receive is the same, but the denomina
tion represents a greater value—it may be double What is
gained by the office holder, the creditor, and by the capitalist, is
lost to the producer, to the owner of property, to the debtor, and
to the laborer they are all sacrificed in the crisis of caprice and
experiment N ow let us look, in the first place, at the condition
of our countiy It is a very large debtor Tne States of this
Union owe at least two hundred millions of dollars, a great part
of it abroad The annual interest may be computed, I suppose,
including the charges, at twelve millions of dollars The debts
owing among ourselves cannot be e-timated with any precision,
nor the debts owing by individuals abroad The debt at home
is unequally divided among different sections of the country; a
large portion of it rests upon the South, and especially the
Soulhwestern States The latter are very heavily encumbered,
at thesame time that their chiet staple has fallen below what any
one cou Id have anticipated It is probable there is a large debt in
the West also, do in the inordinate sales of lands in 1836 and
1836
There is ateo a universal crush and stagnation. There is
with it an unprecedented want of confidence (Property
seemsto have lost us value, credit is destroyed, and labor is
without employment They all stand in need of encourage-
ment and assistance Is it wise, expedient, or just, under these
circumstances, to do any thing which will inciease the distress
—which will co operate with the destruction now going en,
and aggravate the public calamity) Is it consistent with com-
mon humanity to do further injury to the owner of property,
the debtor, and the laboier) Ought we, above all, to throw in
this new and powetful ingredient of injustice and wrong, by
raising the value of money) A parental Government would
see and feel that this duty was in a contrary direction. One
would suppose that the performance of such aduty would, at
all times, be acceptable and pleasing Still, if it were beyond
the power of Government to give any aid, (which I do not ad-
mit,) it is unnatural and cruel in the Government, by its mea-
sures, to place its foot upon the crushed interests of the coun-
try, as if it were de erimned to sink them still lower, and to
ke p them down A change is necessary No one doubts It.
But of all the changes that could be wrought, this Sub Treasu-
ry is most to be deprecated It has no healing in it for the dis
order of the times It is poison* us, and so has proved itself
for the last three years
But we are continually told there has been overtrading, over-
issue, and the like What then) The calamity is upon us,
and our duty is to endeavor to alleviate it. Ought we to seek
to aggravate it) Why, especially, when theie has been a ge-
neral excess, are we lo point our whole indignation against
the banks, even if they had shared in the delusion which af-
fected every branch of business) In a report at the extra ses-
sion theSecretaiy undertook to mstiuct us as to the causes of
our embarrassments The first he mentioned was the over
production of cotton, and the consequent fall pf price, equal to
twenty millions of dollars Why not, then, check the produc-
tion of cotton, restrict its culture, or take it into the hands of
the Government) Examples may be found of such things
The poor Ryots, in Bimsh India, are compelled to cultivate
the opium p ant, at a price fixed by the Government, (so low
as scarcely Ito afford a substance,) and to furnish the product
to their usír-mast-rs, that they may make a profit of some
millions by smuggling the poisonous drug into China. The
Spanish Government kept in us hands a monopoly of tobacco
in Mexico The cultivator could only sell to the Government,
at the price fixed by the Government, who alone manuCactuied
the article, and, when manufactured, sold it at their own price.
From this monopoly, according to Baron Humboldt, Spain
drew an annual revenue of four millions of dollars a year.
The Mexican Government, with a Constitution like our own
(except that the President is only eligible for one term, in which
the have the advantage of ours,) and Republican forms, con-
tinues the monopoly If it be said that such restraints or inter-
ference on the part of Government are inconsistent with the
freedom of the citizen, I admit the answer to just and sufficient
The fluctuations of trade are the effects of the spirit of enter
prise, and when that is left free to exert ifcell, they will occa-
sionally occur We had, at one period, over speculation in
merino sheep, we have lately had it in morus multicaulis—both
appeal to have been foolish errors, and much lo be regretted.
But does any one madly conclude from thia.that tbe Govern-
ment should be investLd with power over the conduct of every
individual in his own affairs)—to tell one man how much cot-
ton he shall raisa, and another how many sheep or trees he
may buy, and at what prices) The spirit of enterprise belongs
te freeGovernmint , and is the offspring of freedom. Occa-
sionally it may be too far md ulged.and the consequences of it fall
heavily on individual , but, in the main, it is productive of
good, and, at all events, is apart of our freedom In its worst
effects, it is only one of tbe smaller waves in the tempestuous
sea of liberty, which we are told is to be preferred to the calm
of despotism This excess, however, by the confession of
thope who charge it, has extended to every branch of business.
There has been excessne production of cotton, the Secretary
tells us there has been excess of importation; the President tells
us there have been excessive sales of public lands; and, in the
midst of all these, we find it said theie has been excess of ex-
pansion by the banks Why is this branch of bromees exposed
to peculiar censure, and, as it were, to the' peculiar vengeance
of the Government) The fault of the banks (if the fault had
been in them) has been the common fau't of us all, fn which
they only participated with the rest They have but their pro-
portion of error to answer for, and why should they be subjected
to punishment for all) They are treated like the lews, in a
former period of the world, who were made responsible foi
everv thing that was adeged to be wrong, and then exposed to
confiscation, pillage, and death. They aie persecuted like the
poor unfortunate bungs who, in times of superstitution, were
charged with being witches, and followed to their destru tion
with a senseless fury The banks are now suffering in common
with the country, whatever it may be owing t\ and must sub-
mit to the corrective of the error, in common wiihothers. More
than this is unjust and injui loue.   It is especially hurtful to the
