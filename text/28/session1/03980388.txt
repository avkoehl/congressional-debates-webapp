and of this excessively reduced amount, a consider-
able proportion came from beyond the Cape of Good
Hope, under the old duties. I find, by the same table,
that the total importations of these, nine months
were §64,753,709
Adding one-third - 21,584,569
Would give for the year a total of . - $86,338,278
This, compared with the average of the ten years
from 1833 to 1842, as stated before, of $114,400,000,
shows a decrease of something less than twenty-five
per cent. How is this extraordinary diminution of
the importation of silk goods to be accounted for?
The year was unquestionably one of crisis, distress,
and diminished consumption; but so great a falling
•off in an article of such general—I might almost say
universal—use, cannot be accounted for by diminish-
ed consumption alone. To prove this, we have only
to refer to the importation of tea and coffee in the
same periods.
Tea in the ten years
estimated in value
to - - -$46,783,131 average $4,678,313
Coffee in the ten
years estimated in
value to - - 93,680,497 " 9,368,049
Average annual value of tea and coffee $14,046,342
Of tea from 1st October,
1842, to 30th June, 1843,
to P,849,228
Add one-third ... 1,283,076
Of coffee from 1st October,
1842, to 30th June, 1843,
to  6,346,787
Add one-third - - - 2,115,596
$5,132,394
!,452,383
$13,584,677
Showing a difference of little more than three per
cent, between the aggregate averages of value for
the ten years, and the aggregate value of last year.
But a reference to the number of pounds imported
for the same periods shows an increase more than
proportionate to the increase of population. The
importation of tea for the ten years from 1833 to
1842 inclusive, as per table contained in Mr. W.
Cost Johnson's report of the third session of last
Congress, (which, notwithstanding the heterodoxy
of Us opinions, is valuable for the very important
statistical information which it embodies,) was
128,356,356 pounds—annual average 12,835,635
The import of tea from 1st
October, 1842, to 30th June,
1843 - - - 13,866,137
Add one-third - - 4,622,046
Gives for the year
18,488,183
Increase in pounds - 5,652,478
Or rather more than forty-four per cent.
The importations of coffee for the ten years,
855,419,762—average - - 85,541,976
The import of coffee from
1st October, 1842, to 30th
June, 1843, was - - 92,295,660
Add one-third - - 30,765,220
Gives for the year ... 123,060,880
Increase in pounds - 37,518,904
A fraction less than forty-four per cent.
The importation of foreign sugars, after deduct-
ing re-exportation, for the years 1833 to 1837 inclu-
sive, was m pounds ... 586,366,994
And from 1838 to 1842, inclusive - 769,784,224
Difference - - - 183,417,530
Showing an increase of about ,'j 1 -} per cent, in live
years.
The total importation of the ten years was 1,346,-
151,218—annual average - - 134,615,121
The imports from 1st Octo-
ber, 1842, to 30th June,
1843, were - . 71,349,060
Add one-third - - 23,783,020
The average crop of Louisi-
ana is estimated at 90,000
hogsheads. The cultiva-
95,132,080
ticm has remained stationa-
ry for the last ten years,
but from the extraordinary
character of the season,
the crop of 1842-43
was much the largest ever
made, (say 140,000 hogs-
headsj exceeding the aver-
age by 50,000,000 pounds,
and thus -dispensing with
an equal quantity of for-
eign sugar, which would
otherwise have been im-
ported - - ' ' - 50,000,000
 145,139,080
Molasses shows nearly the same results; the ag
gregafce importation of the ten years from 1832 to
1841,-.inclusive, was 185,954,228. 1 omit 1842, be-
cause the duty then commenced to be levied by the
pofind instead of the gallon. Annual average in
gallons 18,595,422.
Importation of molasses from 1st Oc-
tober, 1842, to 30th June, 1843,
in pounds - 129,526,523
Add one-third - 43,175,507
172,702,030
14,391,830
2,500,000
At twelve pounds to the gallon, the
usual estimate is, in gallons
Applying the same calculation to mo-
lasses as to sugar, on account of the
extraordinary crop of last year, (say
on 50,000 hogsheads, and fifty gal-
lons to a hogshead)
16,891,830
The same increase would have been shown in
molasses, had not recent treasury regulations, made
under the sanction of the law of 1842, prevented
the fraudulent introduction of sugar under the name
of molasses, to which I will allude more particular-
ly at another time.
The census returns show an increase of popula-
tion of the United States, from 1830 to 1840, of
about 32.6 per cent. This would give for five and
a half years (the average term of the periods I have
compared) an increase of population of about 17.9
per cent. We can deduce from these tables and
calculations several important facts. First, the
steadiness of the laws of trade, manifested in the
consumption of these articles of great and general
use, when undisturbed by the operation of capri-
cious or unfair legislation. Secondly, the consola-
tory reflection that, whatever may have been the
amount of individual suffering during a period of
commercial crisis, the means of comfort and enjoy-
ment of the great mass of our population have
been steadily increasing. From the peculiar mix-
ed character of these three great condiments, sugar,
tea, and coffee, which we are at a loss whether
to class among the necessities or luxuries of life,
there can be no more unerring standard of the im-
proving or retrograding condition of a population
than authentic tables of their consumption. And,
lastly, from the statistics of the silk trade, the in-
evitable effects of excessive duties to check con-
sumption, or encourage smuggling; or, rather, to
produce both tlie&e effects. It is often difficult to
conjecture—always impossible to ascertain, to what
extent the apparently decreased importation of an
article like silk is to be attributed to diminished con-
sumption, caused by high duties, or how much may
be assigned to fraudulent introduction. I am in-
clined to think that much the l&rger proportion is to
be ascribed to the latter cause. No fact is better
ascertained than that, when the rate of duty on any
article is so high as to afford a fair per centage of
profit to the smuggler beyond the proper premium
for the risk of detection, lie will always be found to
take advantage of it. Theie is no more unfailing
law of trade than this: create a sufficient demand for
any class of men as for any branch of industry, and
they will appear to supply it. The per centage of
duty that will call the smuggler into existence de-
pends upon many circumstances—the value of the
merchandise, as compared with its bulk; the nature
and extent of the coast or frontier of the country
where it is to be introduced; the repressive means at
the command of the government whose laws are to be
evaded: and these, again, depend as much—indeed,
more—upon the general character of its institutions
than the number of persons whom it may employ in
this particular branch of its service. Let us institute
a comparison in these respects between the two
f'eatest commercial nations of Europe—Great
ritain and France—and ourselves. Compared with
population, we have a maritime and inland frontier
infinitely more extensive; the number of persons
employed by these governments in the collection
and protection of their revenue is ten-fold greater
than with us. In Great Britain, the power of domi-
ciliary visit is necessarily and constantly exercised,
for the enforcement of their excise laws; while in
France, besides three distinct lines of custom-houses,
the system of duties of consumption, (called the
droits d? octroi,) by which the municipal expenses of
all the towns are supported, exposes every species of
goods to repeated examinations throughout the
whole country. In France, at least every tenth man
is in the employ of the government; and the services
of every class of their employers may be, and fre-
quently are, called into exercise for the protection of
the revenue. The habits of the people of both coun-
tries are such, that they readily submit to a degree of
police and supervision totally at war with the genius
and spirit of our institutions; and no American would
desire that, in this respect, they should undergo a
changc. Let us, then, see—with all the appliances
of governments so much more capable than we are
of enforcing their revenue systems—what is the rate
at which certain descriptions of goods can be smug-
gled. In a debate in the House of Commons, on
the customs act, in May, 1842, reported in Parlia-
mentary Debates, vol. 63, page 367, Sir Robert Peel,
after giving various other reasons for the repeal of
certain duties, said:
There is anotherand an exclusive ground on which, inde-
pendently of that question, I vindicate a reduction of the du-
ties on articles of foreign manufacture. I say that these high
duties are a mere delusion; that they do not constitute a pro-
tection to the British manufacturer; and that, m looking at
those duties for protection, he rests entirely upon a fragile
and faithless support. The check to their operation is the
smuggler. It is a mere delusion to tell the home manufac-
turer that you levy a duty of 35 and 40 per cent, upon the
importation of foreign manufactured articles, if he is robbed
of that apparent protection by the importation of the same
articles in an illicit way; consequently, I think I could con-
clusively show that there is no reduction proposed with re-
spect to foreign manufactures, which I cannot vindicate on
this single and exclusive ground, that the duty remains at
last as high as you can possibly levy it without calling in
the interference of the smuggler In order to remove all
uneasy feeling from the mind of the British manufacturer,
with the permission of the House I will read an important
and bona fide letter, written by a very extensive smuggler.
1 will read it, because I wish to give the House a conclusive
proof of the delusiveness of maintaining high protective du-
ties upon foreign manufactures. This letter is, of course,
not addressed to me, but I can guaranty it to be a bojia fide
letter, addressed by a man of large means and large capital,
in a regular way of business as a smuggler, who, l believe,
has daily intercourse with persons in this great city. It is
dated at the end of December, 1841; and after offering his
services in supplying certain goods to certain persons, he
adds>
"I am also able to forward to you, every week, blondes
and laces, (I mean articles manufactured at Lisle, Arras,
Caen, Chantilly, etc.) at a very low premium, by the indi-
rect channel. The goods would be delivered m London the
same week of the reception here, by a sure and discreet in-
dividual My means are always free of losses and damages,
or I would not use them. Here follow the prices at which
I might, at present, undertake the pa'ssage:
Blondes, by pieces, according to value, 9 per cent.
Blonde veils, according to value, 9 or 9^ per cent.
Laces, (Lisle,) do 8 or S£ percent.
Silk gloves, 11 to 12 percent.
Kid gloves, 12 to 13 per cent.
And generally all silk goods, as gros dp Naples, satins,
gros des Indes, gros de Paris, jewelry, etc.; for which arti-
cles piices would be to be determined, but certainly a great
deal under your custom-house duties"
Can there "be, I ask, a more irresistible, a more tangible
or a more positive pi oof that you are not conferring a benefit
upon the manufacturer by imposing a duty on articles of for-
eign manufacture so high as to afford a premium to the
smuggler, who sets systematically your laws at defiance'
I& it not clear that it is a positive advantage to the domestic
manufacturer that lie should know the txteutof foreign
competition he has to meet? Is it not to hie imprest that he
should be fully and openly aware of it. and not be subject to
an illicit, unseen competition, agamst which he can adopt
no protection'?
The duties on silk goods were then thirty per
cent.; they are now reduced, by Sir Robert Peel's
bill, to twenty per cent. And here let it be recollect-
ed that the principle of protection was involved, the
manufacture of silk in England being a very impor-
tant branch of industry.
In the mmutfs of evidence, taken by the select
committee of impost duties, and accompanying
their report, I would especially call attention to the
testimony of John McGreger, one of the secretaries
of the board of trade, a man of great information
and experience. He says:
. P«r ce?^ *s ^le charge for smuggling certain quali
ties of silk and fine gloves, but for ten and tw el\c per cent
you can get all but the heavy go^ds insured in this country.
High duty promotes and encourages smuggling, and conso>
