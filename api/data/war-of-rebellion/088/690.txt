able force to slash trees in front of the new line toward Petersburg so as to give an unobstructed view from one main redoubt to the other. As soon as a line is staked out from the Gurley to Williams house I will throw on it all the available white troops, say two-thirds, exclusive of the parties on the road. Please telegraph me if this arrangement is satisfactory to the major-general commanding.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

Your dispatches received. The work on the Gurley house redoubt and the line from there to Warre's line should be commenced at once and continued through the night. The slashing you mentioned should be continued to-morrow. One-half the available white troops for the line between the Gurley and Williams house would be better than two-thirds.
