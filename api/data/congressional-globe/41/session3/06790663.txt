THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
663
referred the joint resolution (H. R. No. 434)
extending the use of the Library of Congress
to the commissioners appointed to revise and
consolidate the laws of the United States, to
reuort it back without amendment, and with
the recommendation that it pass ; and I ask
for its immediate consideration. |
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in !
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con- j
sider the joint resolution. I
The joint resolution was reported to the i
Senate without amendment, ordered to a third j
reading, read the third time, atid passed.
PAY OF LIBRARY ASSISTANTS. \
Mr. HOWE. The same committee have j
directed me to report a bill to adjust and fix |
the compensation of the assistants employed |
in the Library of Congress, and if the Senate
will hear me say that the bill increases the
cost of assistance in the Library between four
and five thousand dollars, which is made neces-
sary by imposing upon the Library the copy-
right business, out of which we get about ten
thousand dollars a year in fees, and that there
has been no increase and that the work of j
the Library is now behind for want of this
increase, I think the Senate should agree to
consider the bill at the present time.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I*Uesire to make a
report this morning.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Illinois objects.
Mr. HOWE. Does the Senator object?
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think the bill had
better be printed, as it increases salaries, and
we had better know what it is.
The bill (S. No. 1241) to adjust and fix the
compensation of the assistants employed in
the Library of Congress was read, and passed
to ^ second reading.
SENATORS FROM GEORGIA.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I have b.een instructed
by the Committee on the Judiciary, to whom
were referred the credentials of Joshua Hill,
H. Y. M. Miller, H. P. Farrow, and R. H.
Whitelev, claiming seats as Senators from the
State of Georgia, to make a report accompa-
nied by a resolution. The report will, of course,
be printed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The report will
be ordered to be printed, and the Secretary will
read the resolution accompanying the report.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I give notice that after
the report shall have been printed, which I
hope will be done in the course of a day or two,
1 sbill 1 embrace the earliest opportunity to call
up the resolution and have it disposed of.
The Chief Clerk read the resolution as fol-

the State of Georgia, and is entitled to take his seat
on taking the oaths required by the Constitution and

mittee on the Judiciary, being unable to agree

panying the paper?

companying it. , .
The VICE PRESIDENT. That resolution
will be reported also. i
Mr. STEWART. I should like to have the j

an amendment expressive of his views, which !
are thus expressed :
I agree that Joshua Hill is entitled to take his
seat; and I hold that H. V. M. Miller is entitled to
take his seat on taking the oath prescribed by the
Constitution. A_ ^ XHUKJIAS.
AXX M. IiODEFER.
Mr. WILLEY. The Committee on Patents,
to whom was referred the bill (II. R. No.
1549) to enable Ann M. Rodefer, administra-
trix of Joseph Rodefer, deceased, to make
application for the extension of letters-patent
for an improvement in bedstead fastenings,
have instructed me to report it back and
recommend that the bill pass. This is a
House bill, and I would ask the indulgence of
the Senate that it be placed on its passage
now.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee on the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It proposes to allow Ann M.
Rodefer, administratrix of Joseph Rodefer,
deceased, to make application to the Commis-
sioner of Patents for the extension of letters-
patent granted to him for an improvement in
bedstead fastenings, on the 10th of April,
1855, for fourteen years, in the same manner
as if the petition for extension had been filed
at least ninety days before the expiration of
the patent; and the Commissioner of Patents
is authorized to consider and determine the
application in the same manner as if it had
been filed ninety days prior to the expiration
of the patent; and with the same effect as if it
had been regularly filed and acted upon under
existing laws. But no such sxtension shall
affect the right to continue to use the machine
of any person who, since the 10th of April,
1869, and prior to the approval of the act,
may have procured, and at the time of such
approval shall be using, the machine.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
NEW LAND DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA.
Mr. CASSERLY. I am instructed by the
Committee on Public Lands, to whom was
referred the bill (S. No. 1190) to create an
additional land district in the State of Cali-
fornia, to report the same back with amend-
ments, with the recommendation that it pass.
There seems to be an urgency for the creation
of this land district at this session of Congress.
I ask, therefore, that the bill may be put upon
its passage now. The amendments made by
the committee to the bill are but few, and
relate merely to the boundaries of the new
district. The bill has the indorsement of the
United States Land Commissioner.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill.
Mr. POMEROY. I inquire if the Senator
has made.the boundaries conform to the rec-
ommendations of the Commissioner ? He sent
us a letter recommending that the boundaries
be changed from the original bill. Are they
so written by him ?
Mr. COLE. They are. .
Mr. POMEROY. I have no objeetion it the
boundaries.are made to conform to the rec-
ommendations of the Commissioner.
Mr. CASSERLY. I stated that the bill had
been amended as to the boundaries.
Mr. COLE. I think the boundaries are
entirely correct now. _
Mr. RAMSEY. I ask the chairman of the
committee how many land offices there are
now in California?
Mr. POMEROY. Four.
Mr. RAMSEY. This makes five.
Mr. POMEROY. This will make five.
Mr. COLE. I believe one of the land dis-
tricts comprises part of Nevada. I think there
are five altogether. There can be no objection
to this bill.
The amendments were in line twenty-two of
section one to strike out "twenty-six" and
insert " twenty-five," and in the same line to
strike out" twenty-seven " and insert" twenty-
six:" so as to make the bill read:
Be it enacted. &c., That so much of the districts of
lands subject to sale under existing laws at Marys-
ville and Shasta, in the State of California, as are
contained in the following'boundaries, shall consti-
tute a new land district, to be called the Susanville
district, bounded as follows: beginning at a point
where the north boundaiy of township nineteen
north. Mount Diablo meridian, intersects the eastern
boundary of the State of California; thence west on
the north boundary of township nineteen north, to

north, ranges thirteen and fourteen east; thence west

boundary of the State of California; thence east on
said boundary line to the northeast corner of said
State; thence south on the eastern boundary of said
State to the place of beginning.
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted. That the location
of the office for said district shall be designated by
the President of the United States, and may be
changed by him from time to time as the public con-
venience may seem to require.
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted. That there shall
be appointed by the President, by and with the
advicc and consent of the Senate, a register and
a receiver for said land district, who shall respect-
ively be required to reside at the site of the office,
be subject to the same laws, and entitled to the same
compensation as is, or may hereafter be, prescribed
by law in reljtion to other land offices in said State.
The bill was reported to the Senateas amend-
ed, and the amendments were concurred in.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third
