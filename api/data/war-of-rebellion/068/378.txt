HDQRS. FIFTH ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Old Wilderness Tavern, May 4, 1864 - 3.05 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My whole command is in this vicinity. There was no water to camp on after leaving Flat Lick Run. General Robinson is about 1 mile nearer to you than the rest. He pickets along the plank road to connect with General Getty, of the Sixth Corps, at Flat Lick Run. General Wadsworth throws out a picket-line along the gravel road, 3 miles toward Chancellorsville, to near the junction with the plank road. My position is good. The men are almost all in camp washing their feet, and with a good night's rest will feel fine. I have repaired the bridges here, at least six in number, otherwise not passable for wagons, and left a large pioneer force to complete the crossings at Flat Lick Run, besides calling General Getty's attention to them. I have one brigade out nearly 1 mile toward Parker's Store.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
