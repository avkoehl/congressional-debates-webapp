APRIL 1, 1865.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

I have just heard from Sheridan. He has captured three brigades of the enemy and is pushing him still. Everything the enemy has will probably be pushed against him. Get your men up and feel the enemy and push him if he shows signs of giving way.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DABNEY'S MILLS, April 1, 1865.

Major-General ORD:

General Wright speaks with great confidence of his ability to go through the enemy's lines. I think as you have such difficult ground to go over your reserves had better be pushed well over to the right, so that they can help him or go in with you, as may be required.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch received announcing Sheridan's victory. Have ordered my men to mass, and will obey the order.

Major-General ORD:

Your dispatch of this evening received. You have received my dispatch announcing Sheridan's victory since writing yours.

I want you to see, though, if the enemy is leaving, and if so follow him up.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS, April 1, 1865-11 p.m.

General U. S. GRANT:

Your dispatch to follow Wright is received. I think if the enemy concentrates on Sheridan I am near enough to be of service to him, and if Wright gets in he is strong enough to stay there without my help. I agree with you that it is probable the enemy has given up the line in our immediate front, and I hope to be able to send you the first reliable information on the subject, as my scouts and pickets are feel-
