FOURTH INSTALLMENT OF DEPOSIT
The bill to postpone the fourth installment of
the deposit act was taken up as the mdei of i íe
day, when
Ml PRESTON said Ins object in using, when
this subject was last before the S"nate, was to '
íefute and couect a mjsiepiesentation respecting
his position m regard to it He had given his
support ouginally to the measuie, but it was as
a deposit bill, not as one for distribution Al-
though aware of the necessity of getting nd of
the accumulated burptus, nad he known its piae-
tical effect he could no , except as an extreme
necessity, have vo ed foi it What he had said
the otho day was applicable to the bill as it vvas
practically aid in efiect—a bill foi distribution
instead of deposit As a deposit act it provided
that the Secretai y of the Tieasury might reclaim
the moneys fiom the States whenever the exi
geicies of the Government rendered it necessary
but a* i subsequent session it was so amended,
at the instance o* an honorable Senatoi fiom Penn
sylvema, [Mi Buciiaí.\\,] as o take tinsdiscie
tion fiom the Secietaiy When it wis proposed
to cicatea national debt, he was willing to have
moved for the íecall of this mom j The lion
oiable Senator fiom Virginia [Mi Paves] said,
that to have lecalled it at tht last si ss on, duung
the fiscal embarr isvments, would have been rum
ous to the States, and that nothioa but a foieign
w u would be a justifiable cause foi so doing, but
I think that the States could, by tluir ctedit, have
easily laised meant, to piy off tins debt Undei
that state of aflaiis, Congress decided in favoi
of a lutioml debt in prefeience to lechiming
the deposit with the States One gitat berieft
expected fiom the opeiation of this act was, that
whenevei the Government was disposed to a
piodigahty of expenditure, the States uould be
induced to interpose and arrest the evil Did they
do so' It was expectt d that whenever the wants
of the Government requned moie than their ira
mediate means these deposits would beattsource
foi us to draw on to supply the deficiency Did
we do so ' No, sn , we have a national debt ex
isttng, on which we are paying interest, while
the money is stiU in deposit with the States
Congress has, by its legislation, declaicd its most
unequivocal condemnation of the deposit act I
do not íepiobate the bill as passed, but think
that, as no human being entertains the idea that
this money will be evei paid, the most honest
phn will he to stuke it from the statute book
altogethei
The Senator from Noi th Caio! na[Mi Brown]
has thought proptr, m his lemaiks, to cndeavoi
to make the minority of the body responsible for
the acts of the majonty, to make us responsible
for the acts passed by the raajouty whit i they
may discover to be evil, and also for the loss of
nieasuies which are defeated that"they may deem
beneficial In all meie paity matters the Admin
istration have the magouty, and can pass what
icts they please If economy is an Admmist a '
tion rieasuie, the putycan give our legislation
that tendency Fie has also thought piopei to
refer to my couiae on the bill appropmtmg
¿5,000,000 foi Fieuch spoliation puoi to 1800
I cannot undeistand the economy of refusing to
pay an honest debt to an individuil wno holds my
bond Su, 1 would diam youi Xieasurj to the
last cent, weie it iieetssiry for this pmposc I
never supported a mgg-<v<i economy, that would
defeat the ends of Government by stiaitening tht
means for an efficient admimstiation of it Tht
purchase of the library of Count Bourtillmt would
have íeaied a nob'e monument to our Uteratuie,
and would have been the means of diffusing in-
formation vv Inch cannot be derived fi om any othei
souico in the Umtf d States As to the paintings,
he did not piofess to be a connoisseur in such
matteis, but his proposition vvas,t3 submit the
selection of the paintings to competent judge¡ 
Though he did not piofess to have any gieat skill
in the fi íe aits, yet he had t taste foi paintings
and he thought it much better tootnament the
halls of Cong) ess with speeinens of the fine aits
than with barbaric go'd and pearl He was per
ftc ly wiling toineui the opprobrium of thatsott
<f extiavagance that adds to the welfare, the
lionoi,oi the gloiy ot oui common c mntiy
Mi BROWN, in reply, observed that he would |
not have m ide the remaiks the gentleman ¡eferred
to on Thursd ty last, but fot the repeated charges
made by gentlemen oit ti e other side of the Cham
bei of extiavagance against the Adromistiation
and its f„ ienas It was well known that this was
one of the gie it engines by which the Opposition
sought to piostrate the Administration, and he
flit it, thetefore. to be his duty to show that it
rind its fuends were not responsible for the many-
extravagant appropnations *that had UeBti taade
here 1 he gentlerran te'ls as (said Mr B ) that
these expenditures have been founded on esti-
mates furnished by the executive depaitments,
but surely the gentleman did not charge the mi-
rority with the annual estimates of the Depart
ments, and he surely did not recollect that Con-
giess, m its appiopuations of the last session,
exceeded the estimates some ten or twelve mil-
lions Suiely the gentleman would not say that
the Admiiiisttation was responsible foi this ex-
cess When he addressed tfreSenate last on this
subject, he took occasion to say that, if the yeas
and nays weie examined.it would be found-that
atleasttwo thuds of thosevotingfoi these extrav-
agant expendituies weie in the ranks of the Op-
position It was because some ftwinetMs of the
Admmistiation voted with the great body of the
Opposition that these appropriations had been got
tliiough It was will known that, for stvcial years
pist,thts body was neaily in an equilibrium, and
that a very few of the Adminis'iation patty voting
with the Opposition enabled them to carry through
these appiopuationswhieh enabled them since to
i use the charge of extravagance against the for-
mer It was w th the detei mmation not to suffer
himself and the paity with which he acted to be
identified with these extravagant expenditures
that he felt called on to make the explanation
which he did on Thursday last The honorable
gentleman 'suiely did noliecolleet that the fuends
of the Administration had, until within a few
yeais past, been in a mmonty in this body; and
did the gentleman hold the Administration re-
sponsible forexpendituies voted foi by a majority
opposed to it' If he did, it was a new kind ot
political casuistry not veiy consistent with jus-
tice The gen*'tman spoke with regard to the five
miliums he pioposed to give to the merchants for
Trench spoliations puoi to 1800, also, to the
§40,000 he wished to appropriate for the purchase
of paintings as well as the <$>Q,000 he wished to
lay out in a libiaiy The gentleman also spoke
of his libeial views, and his icj;ard foi the line
ai ts Now, he had no objection to the gentleman
indulging m his liberality, hut he certainly did
object to his doing so, and afterwaids chaigmg
the Administration and its friends w th the ex-
travagance it led to He admued the taste of the
gentleman foi the fine aits,and had no objection
to his indulging it—it was a refined and noble
taste, but Congicss had no constitutional power
to encourage the fine aits, and it was a matter
more piopei for the exercise of the gentleman's
own private libelality
With regaid to the sub Tieasureis to whom
the gtntlemaii alluded, and some of whom had
esctped fiom the United States, he would only
obst tve that the gen'ieman might with g^eatjus-
tice have spoken í f the banks through whose aid
ti ev peipetiated then 'lauds It was a pait of
the deposit bank system, that thiough the means
of these banks, these fiauds were so long con-
cealed It was beca ise the officeis of the Gov-
ernment of the Umttd S ates had no means of
looking into the vaul s of these banks, that these
uen were enabled to conceal then defalcations
Had tneie been a sub Tieasury—if the officers of
the Government had had the tight of looking mto
the safety of the public money, there Would have
been none of these fiauds committed. It was be
cause the public money was put in the vaults ot
the banks, where all scrutiny into its safety was
precluded, that these fiauds had been so lon¿ con-
cealed
The question was then taken on Mt Ciav's
amendment to postpone the installment to the 1st
of Januaiy, 1840, and deemed in the negative—
