and missing of my division, 5, 000 strong, was 2, 088, of whom 171 were officers and 1, 917 enlisted men. The missing numbered 3 officers and 263 enlisted men, the greater part of whom were probably wounded; some were killed. I appended a tabular list of the loss. * As I have already stated, my Third Brigade was ordered to the support of Major-General Birney, commanding the First Division. The accompanying report of Colonel George C. Burling, commanding that brigade, exhibits the disposition that was made of the regiments of the brigade. In succession they, with the exception of Colonel Sewell's regiment, were sent to aid the brigades of the First Division. The Seventh New Jersey, Colonel Louis R. Francine commanding, and the Second New Hampshire, Colonel Edward L. Bailey commanding, were sent to the support of General Graham's brigade, and the Eighth New Jersey, Colonel Ramsey commanding, the Sixth New Jersey, Lieutenant Colonel S. R. Gilkyson commanding, and the One hundred and fifteenth Pennsylvania, Major Dunne commanding, were sent to the support of General Ward's brigade. For the part taken in the engagement by these regiments, I must refer to the reports of the commandeers of these brigades. That they did their duty in a manner comporting with their high reputation is manifest from the severe loss they met with - 430 killed and wounded. Colonel Sewell, Colonel Francine, Colonel Ramsey, and Lieutenant-Colonel Price, officers distinguished for their skill and gallantry, were severely wounded. Colonel Francine's wound proved to be mortal. Colonel Bailey and Lieutenant-Colonel Carr, Second New Hampshire, were also wounded. The fortune of war rarely places troops under more trying circumstances than those in which my division found itself on this day, and it is greatly to their honor that their soldierly bearing sustained the high reputation they had already won in the severest battles of the war. The fine qualities of manu officers were brought out conspicuously. In some instances their gallant conduct fell under my own observation. I wish particularly to recommend to notice the cool courage, determination, and skillful handling of their troops by the two brigade commanders, Brigadier-General Carr and Colonel William R. Brewster, and to ask attention to the officers mentioned by them as distinguished by their conduct. My attention was attracted by the gallant bearing of Captain Le Grand Benedict, assistant adjutant-general, First Brigade, and of Lieutenant E. A. Belger, aide, staff of Second Brigade. Lieutenant F. W. Seeley's gallantry, skill, good judgment, and effective management of his battery excited my admiration, as well as that of every officer who saw him. I should not omit to mention the bold and determined manner in which Lieutenant Turnbull managed his battery. Lieutenant Manning Livingston, of this battery, was killed during the engagement. Of my own staff, part of whom had gone through hotly contested fields with me before, I might well use the highest terms of commendation that language admits of, though in speaking of their acts I am painfully reminded that as yet I have been powerless to further the advancement they have won while serving with me. Most conspicuous for gallantry and untiring efforts in aiding me in forming, encouraging, and leading the troops were
