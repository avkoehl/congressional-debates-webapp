Major W. H. TAYLOR:

Averell did not cross the Warm Springs Mountain, but is moving toward Covington. W. L. Jackson is at Clifton Forge, Echols at Covington. Rumored that Echols had a skirmishw ith the Kanawha force at Greenbier bridge, and was compelled to fall back. Fitz. Lee is moving down the Valley to act in concert with Rosser. Mulligan reported at McDowell with 1,000 infantry. I will endeavor to capture this force and cutt of Averell's retreat.

RICHMOND, December 16, 1863.

Major W. H. TAYLOR:

Superintendent Central Railroad states, in consequence of use of cars in transportation of troops, no corn can be sent to army before Saturday. Let every exertion be made to supply deficiencies by collecting forage in vicinity.

R. E. LEE.

[Indorsement.]

General EWELL:

GENERAL: As regards the question of corn, I have just seen major Harman, who has gone to ascertain what we have on hand. One-half the artillery of the Third Corps is back, two brigades of cavalry (in Valley) are absent, and part of your artillery gone back. With the number of horses thus diminished, I hope we can get along, but no effort should be spared to get as much as possible from the country in the neighborhood of the troops.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lee, stating that he entered the Valley and proceeded as far as Mount Grawford, when finding all quiet in the lower Valley, he turned to Staunton and would re-enforce Imboden if necessary. I also received a telegram from Major O'Ferrall at woodstock, stating that the enemy were encamped at Strasburg and had advanced a force of cavalry as far as the Narrow Passage.

Captain Otey, at Liberty, reports Averell advancing from Salem to Bonsack's. A brigade will be sent from here to Lynchburg. Averell must be captured. Use Fitz. Lee's division to intercept him. See that forage is provided for his horses.
