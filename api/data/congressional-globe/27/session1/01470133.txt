when the fact was, there was scarcely any body present to hear
them
Mr A thennoticed buenvsome of the remarks of thestentle
man from Indiana, [Mi Kennedy ] m relation to the Cherokee
land  purchased Dy the Geneial Government, and went on to
remark that the subject of State Rights was very little under
stood here, compared with what it was m Georgia When a
State Rights man came to Congress he found that the States
Rights doctrine was differently piauised upon here than at
home He (Mr A ) admitted that there must be some little
yielding, and that there could net be a strict application of the
principles, m every instince, in matters of national legislation
He professed himself to be a State Rights man, and as one who
ardently chenshed, advot ated, and cteiented the principles of
that paity
Mr   A. nest refeired to what had been said by the gentle
man from Matyiand [Mr VV C   IohnsonJ in regard to the dis
tribution of the proceeds of the public lands in connection with
the  subject of ¡state  lights, and inuma'ed his entire  dissent
horn the position assumed    He then pointed to the fact of the
indebtedness of the States generally, which amounted to up
wards of two hundred millions of dollars, and asked if it was
right, after they had most enormous sum   arpropnated by
the General Government lor the purpose of internal improve
inent, that they should come here and ask Congiess to give
them many imlhonof dollar"out of the public Treasury m or
del tu enable them to hqut la e then   debts     He was free to ad
' mit, with the aivocates of this bill,that the money ansmg irom
the sales of the pioceeds of the public lands should be divided
among the several "stales, but not at this time    He was undei
the full and fii m conviction (hat it would be inj udicious and high
ly improper to pass adistnbution bill at this particular june
ture of out affaus   He wished to be undeistood as saying that
if the Government was well off having plenty of money, and
that if there was no piospect oí war, &c the measure proposed
might   be   propel   enough     But   he   asked,  how  did we
standi   What  are the  receipts  of the Government?   What
did the Piesident tell  us'     Why, he   intimated   that   this
was not the proper time, hut that if it was, the measure
might be well enough, and he submitted to Congiess, whether,
m our embarrassed condition, such a measure would be advi
sable
He (Mr A ) would ask whether, undei the existing circum
stances, it would be proper to take out oí the coffers of the
United States Ircasuiy the money demanded by the States
with a view to pay then debt", when the inevitable consequence
wouldbe the mciease of our taiiff! And when too, the secre
tiry of the Treasury said, in so manv words, that the Admims
tration could not pay the national debt, and if the interest on it,
that was alii-Ml A then adverted to what was said by the
Secretaiy ot the freasuiy m hi-, report m lelationto the sute
of the finances, and then he aigued that we ought not to abstract
any money fi m the Tieasuiy at the piesent time
lodoso would be tbu height of folly Thefttates it is said,
Stan! m lela ion to the General Goveinme t as chddien to a
parent, and yet ills pioposed that the money helonglng to he
parent, overhead nd ears m debí, must be taken to pay the
debts of thechildien
£ will suppose a case said Mi A Here la a father who
owes aconsideiable sum to various creditots but the money he
has on hand is not neai enough to pay it Well, the son conies
up to the oldgentleman, and says,
' I say, father "
" What, my sen i"
"Why, I have come to tell you that you have no occasion to
use that money in youi cofleis, for paying your carpen er, your
baker your buti her, and all the ret,t of them '
o Why'"
"Because, sa>sthe dutiful sou "vou must give me that
money to pay my debts, and let your own take their chance "
Now, said Mi A this is the very thing that is proposed at the
piesonttime The Geneial Government isde< ply in debt, and
yet the Slates want to get the proceeds from the sales of the pub
lie lands from the Treasury, to pay their own debts instead of
allowing it to go towaids paying the claims of their parent Mv
doctlineis, let the States pty their own debt-*, and let the Gene
ral Government pay us debts
He appealed to the lriendt, of General Harnson (whom he
wished to God was now living) to lemember the advice of that
good man, and to follow it, but he regretted to say theie seemed
to be a di-pnsiuon here to kill oil every man who would not be a
slave He could only «ay that as fai as he was concerned, they
could not kill him oil, (a laugh,) and he would be to the Whig
cause a true and faithlul friend although many theie might be
wno would not acknowledge him to be so now, although the
time was coming when they would He was one of that class
ot men who would fiankly and candidly tell his fuends what he
thought, when he saw them going wrong He had done so at
the last se ion He would tell the frit nds of Geneial Harnson
that if he were now living he would have advised them to have
purmed a different course from that which they were taking,
and although he might have been a friend to distribution, yet he
(Mr A ) did not believe that ho would have advised it at this
time, that he would have said take the monev outoftheTrea
sury of theLmted States   although the credltol is tapping at
youi door                                                   , ,

dered away the nett] loceeds ol the public lands to pay btate
debts md mike a high tariff woulifnot be sustained it homo,
bat that theOppo mon,whe weie ea«le eyed, and ready drilled,
would pounce down upon them like a duck upon a dune bug
(Laughter and applause 1
Mr A expiessed a hope th-t the I oco Tocos would not ap
plaud him daughter 1 AH this flattery of his Loco inends
only made him meie firm m his position They must not ex
peet to win him ovet because he cjuld nevei eo their doc
trines They had preached economj and practi ed extrava
gance Tvow he wj< disposed to take the w y opposite couise
Mr A complained that theie were prtam paitsOt the Stcreia
ry oftheTteasurv'siepoit with which he was much dissatis
fied, because he did not carry out the pnncii les of refoim
and retrenchment which had been promised u=
He then went on to mquue whit had the people sent them
here to do Why («aid he) to mike a Bank iheio was an
overruling necessity he contendt 1 luí the adaption of that
measure = His t vnstituents had n s mcttd him to vote lor a
Bank bill, although he confessed that he had been opposed to
the establish nent of a iSational Bank ill his life He deemed,
howevei, that the occasion lal again ainvel which mduted
Mr Madison to give his sanction to the adoption a like a mea
«ure many years ago—that of an m erruling and impel lous ne
cessity arising outof the deranged state of the currencv and the
commercial affairs of the country He maintained that they
were bound to pass a Bank bill belore they adjourned, and then
i everting to the subject of ataníf, he said that gentlemen asked
a di tnbution of the proceeds of the public lands in order to
create a tariff, which was a proposition that could not be j ueti
fied, and was exceedingly unfair to theSouthern portion of the
Union He then warned the Whig party that they were pur
suing the most suicidal course that could possibly be, and that
then opponents were ready to take every advantage of them
* Mr A then proceeded to atgue that a Bank ought to be esta
blished on the cash system What the country wanted was
good money, and plenty of it But how could his Whig friends
talk about establishing a Bank, when they were about to squan
der away the money which was to foim the capital of the Bmki
He would tell them that if they desired to have a eood Bank
they must husband their resources, but if they were to scaiter
then money to he four w inds of Heaven, as proposed by this
bill, how in Heaven's name could-they think of getting alongt
After touching on a vailety of other topics, Mr A c nc uded
by warning the 'tariff boys'5 ol the south, that instead of their
reading him out of chuich, if they did not mind he would lead
them outof church
Mr A having concluded, and the hour of 3 having aruved—
Mr BROWN moved that the committee Use, which motion
having prevailed—
The committee lose, icpoued progress, and obtain d leave
to sit again
