drawings of the columbiad platform and carriage, and of the 32 and 24 pounder carriage barbette. Please to examine whether it is possible to spare us one hundred pounds of 24-grape. We have the arsenal to-day. Would Allston (Ben.) come over here with me? My kindest regards to all.

Very truly, yours,

W. H. C. WHITING.

P. S-I try to be as cool and patient as you are, but it is awful hard work. They are military in South Carolina. Here they are willing enough, but the military has yet to grow.

RALEIGH, April 24, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

You shall have from one to ten thousand volunteers in a few days, with arms, and I wish them to go as State troops. Many of our men will enlist in Confederate Army. Will have a regiment ready in four days. Funds will be required for transportation, as I cannot lawfully draw on the State treasury for this purpose. I am anxious to send at least three regiments. Our legislature will meet in few days. I will not await, however.

JOHN W. ELLIS.

MONTGOMERY, April 25, 1861.

Gov. J. W. ELLIS,

Raleigh, N. C.:

I shall have to supply with arms three regiments from Tennessee and one from Arkansas that rendezvous at Lynchburg, Va. Can you send this Government two thousand percussion muskets to be sent to Lynchburg?

L. P. WALKER.

RALEIGH, April 25, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

Arms at Fayetteville off the railroad. Two thousand percussion muskets are at your service soon as can be procured. Where will you have them sent?

JOHN W. ELLIS.

MONTGOMERY, April 25, 1861.

Gov. J. W. ELLIS,

Raleigh, N. C.:

Am much obliged for the muskets, and request that you send them to Richmond, Va., to my address as Secretary of War of the Confederate States. The troops to be supplied by North Carolina will rendezvous at Richmond. Transportation provided by the Government. Let me know when they will be ready.

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, April 25, 1861.

Gov. J. W. ELLIS,

Raleigh, N. C.:

Major Whiting writes from Wilmington that he needs one thousand muskets and accouterments, and one hundred rounds ammunition from Fayetteville Arsenal.

L. P. WALKER.
