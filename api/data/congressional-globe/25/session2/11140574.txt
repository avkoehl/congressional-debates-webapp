APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dee. 1837:
£5th Cong"--2nd Sess.
Piesi'lent's Message—Mr. Gushing.
ti. of Rep8.
Snemyto a sound currency, who thinks 11 proper and conve
ruentfor Government, as well as individuals, to make UiloiUi
nary yse ofbank eirculaumi1 With how much tinlhcan it be
said that he is a paoer money man, wlio only ttibhes that a
practice should be continued which began it the beginning, and
has lasted Miroighour whole history—a piacuce irom which
ttie people have derived much benefit and advamage, and m
consequence of which, so fai a& I know, Govprnuient has sus
tamed no loss nor injury, except what has ansen liom ¡he
events of last yeail
The true legal cons'ruclion of the resolution ofl816 is a nues
tlon which I shall not no* discuss at any length My opinion
on that point diffels from that emeuameii by the Senaic As
thebills of specie paying banks stand in the íesolution with the
legal currency of the country, Treasury notes, and bills of the
l?anBi of the United Stages, and as all ait- under the influence of
the very same words, 1 cannot hut think that It is the duty of
collectors to receive either, when offeied It is said, however,
that the resolution only permit* the leceipt oftheee bills, and
that public officers may still lefuse them, if they see fit But it
is to be remembered that (he receipt ot these bills is aul/ioi ized
by the very same words which reitct the receipt ol the hills, ot
hon specie paying banks Ho , then, is the injunction to be
regarded as imperative foi one nuipooe, and permisivo only a?
to the otherl                                                                            '
No duubt, sir, there aie certain limitations and qualifications
imposed by the veiy natuie of ihe case, and which must be re
spected The bills, to be receivable, must be bills of specie
paying bank , and the collector must of course know them to
be such He must be acquainted with the seneial charact r of
the institution from which the bills issue, and pn haps, it would
not be leasonable to expect him to posbess (his knowledge in le
iationtoany othel b^nks than such asneiem his immediate
neighborly d, with whose character and daily operations he
was «mveisant Ceitamly he would not be bound to act upon
vague and general information respecting dktant institutions
which v>eic unknown to him With these necea=ary limit i
tions, I cannot but think the resolution mipe itive lhe den
sion, however) has been the other way, and I acquiesce m it
Bothhousesof Congiesb have acted iqonihe supposition tint
there still exists a discieiion in the Secretary of the Treasury
My present purpose is, therefore, to rttU'ain and con'rol that
discieiion, and to put un end to it in one lmpouant paiti
cular
The Constitutionality of the icsolntion of 1816 hacheen denied,
but I cannot doubt that Congress may authorize the íecepnon
■oí bank bills, if it choo es lo be sine, all taxes and duties
must be uniform, and theiefore roust eveiy whole he p mi in a
currency of uniform value But the \alue of convertibb bank
notes isjust as uniform as the value of specie use  It appeals
tome, su,that on these subjects we surround oui elves with
ideal difficulties, and embarrass ouiselves by reasomng upon
tacts which, piacucally, havese'dom any existence Abetter
Fno« ledge of actual transactions, and of the usual modes of
business, would olten very much improve oui judgments
On all these subjects, we are to lemember that, ordinarily,
the Government has in its own hands nellhei  specie noi bills ,
that us funds are in the keeping of somebo ly, tint, after all,
they ace but ciedils in accou it, that they exist, not in specific
masaesof gold and silver, nor in specific parcels of bank bills,
but in balances due from collectors and receivers, that succes
stve collections are earned as new credits to the e accounts,
that, as drafts aie received, they are paid in anv manner tint
suits the holder, and charged In the account    All peisons at
tjuamted with such affans know that, of the whole amount ie
ceived at the custom house, very little i  paid othei wi^e th m by
merchants' checks, by means of whu h the proper amount Í.
ti ansferred from the accour t of the person paying to ih it of the
collector, eithei in the same bank ot some other    Oidmanly
there arise but thiee occarions for the direct use of specie in
large amounts    one is, to adjust balances between difleieiit
cities; another occurs when the «me of foieign trade requires
an exportation of specie to adjust national balances, and the
third is, a demand foi gold and silver lor canymg on borm pai
ticular branches of commerce such as the Chin x tilde forn nly
was    These uses of specie do not, of course, include that por
tion of gold and silver which is intended to pass fiomhanl to
hand, and to form pai t of the general en culation    I speak only
of the occasion  m which specie may be called form masses,
foi the purpose of showing that occasions for such calls aie not
frequent     Thus we have seen that, 11 the foui oi five months
thatwehave been debating hpre, upon theories and abstrae
lions, upon schemes and projects, several of the States have
negotiated large loans, leabzed the pioceels in specie or it 
equivalent conducting all then opeiationssuccessfully through
•he agency of skilful men and making no commotion bv vio
lent movmgs of the precious metals    I really wish sn that we
had a little more of this quiet and practical wisdom   We might
Well exchange for it some part of oui elaborate and long con
tmued theoretic reasoning on general principles
Mr President, it is the fashion now a days to denource a'!
banking institutions, to call them little anstociacies and odious
monopolies, and to find m them causes sufficient for the ovei
throw of the Government, and the destiuction of popular h
berty It is the temper of the times to mdulgu in tie cbullitu n
of tais spirit Banks are separated fiom the people they aie
supposed to have been created for then own benefit only, to
hare been, from the first, enemies of the publicgood andto be
musa ees which the people shouldget rid of as soon a<°po=sible
Now, sil, all this is very unlike the leelmg which prevailed in
1816 At that time banks were regarded a  institutions which
the people of the States had established for their own conve
menee We intended, indeed, that they should perforin ti en
du y, but we meant, at the same time, to aid them in the per
formance of it, as fai as wa  m our power The whole temper
and tone of Government towards the banks were then wholly
unlike what now prevail Look to the history oftheadmims
trauon of the Treasury Department lecurtoMi Crawfotd s
correspondence, you will  ee a disposition every wheie to en
courage the State hanks, to gi\ e them assistance and to inspire
the community with confidence in them There w as, indeed,
sir, one proposition made to Congress at that period, which
contrasts strikingly with opinions and sentiments now aulently
supported The honorable gentleman from South Caiolnia
himself brought forward a measure for an issue of Treasury
notes to the amount of ñiteen mil ions of dollars, tobe loaned to
thebanks,onsuch security as the Secretary of the Treasuiy
mightapprove, reimbursable m annual instalment This was
done on the avowed principle of lending to ¡he einstltutlorsthe
support and ciedlt of Government, m ordei to enable them to
resume payments and restore the currency    The proposition
id notsucceed, but it met with considerable favoi It was sup
polled on the giound that the banks weie but institutions cie
ateil for the benefit of lhe ( eople, and that, m the existing state
of things, the community would be benefited by wha^evei
should enable them toi deem then depreciated papel, and thus
lestoiothpct'i'eney of the country How different, sn, fuw
wide'y diffeient, is ad this fiom those loud and vehement tones
of rebuke, lepioach, and denunciation which ha^e filled and
almost shaken, the walls of (hese chambeis foi months pa t'
I conclude, Mi President, by repeating the expiession of my
pei feet conviction that the parage of this resolution will be
productive of much good, that it will act powerfully on the gi eat
object of resumption, aha (hat tve shall s*>e its efiects immedi
ately So soon, sir, as it shall have passed, I shall invite the at
tendon of the Senate to other measures which will he necessaiy,
as I think, in ordci to give it full effect

Mr GUSHING spoke ab follows Mi ( haumaii I felt it to
be my dutv, at tl e late exit aordmary session of Gongiess ami
under the peculiar circumstances m which the countrj was
then placed, to mingle in the discussion of questions oí party
politics more than had previously been my wont, and more
than I intend or define to dolereiftei Th< aspect of jmolic
affairs has undergone a material cuange *"i¿*e that time
The twenty fifth Congtess has reassembled, and is enlisted m
the consiueralion of diiotUei M(,&aai,e of lhe President uf tut,
United Suns but undei auspices how diffeirni fiom ihos-p
which attended the opening and the progieb  of the extiaordi
naiy session'
When, at that session, the President, aided by his suppojtei^
in Concrete, wasuigins; JOiwaidthc new scheme of powei, (o
place the pecuniaiy mteie-ts of the. whole at the mercy of Jie
Ftdeial Executive, I m> elf, m common with otheis tntettam
ing thesame poluitaloj m ons,declared (o the House that, '11
the assembled repiescnt uves of the na ion did nothing el e foi
the public good in that emergency, if all the power and ínfiu
ence of the Fxev-uuve weie to be excited is a diag on the
wheels of legislation, to preclude the adoption of measmes of
general relief—this at least they might and would do—they
might and would cntei up an appeal to the people against the
conduct and the purposes of the Administration "
Horn the odious rescript of the Chief Magistiate, fiom the
assentation of a supple Senate, piompt to ítgiet r Ins will, it
wa^ the custom nf the representatives oí the people oí Rome
to appeal to the people of Rome Tie imitated (heir ll ustu
ous example And geneicusly, nobly g oi.otis y have the peo
pie judged the appeal ol then iir recenta tivcs They havt,( ro
nounced, at the polls, sent* nee of condemnation on the mad
piojectsof *he AdminiMiation They have Condemned it in
their pnmaiy assemblies, they have condemned u by then
votes, they have condemned it in the triumphant rejoicings
over success, which ie echo from the east to v.est, thiough the
wide exparsb of fht Union
And how i1 >es tin. Piesident íeeeive rhe dtihrcl will of the
people'1 W hat savs he, the chief the elect the olie representa

tJnijn'' Does he bow in leady, in íe^r eotful, m humble «nib
minion to the decision of the súpleme power of the Republic,
the people pronouncing judgment m the majesty of their suve
reiguty, against the favonte mesure of the Admim&trrition''
No but he descends fiom his high estate to look into the elei
ttonsinthe se\eial Stiles, and to cuticise and impugn the deci

He adheies to his own particul^rpHnof a Ijusung the financial
question of the day rejected and condemned as that plan is by
the deciee of the sovereign people1
This new and rfmaikable contingency of public affairs calls
on us, the people's representatives, to see to then weliare, to
take care that the Republic receive no detriment It pointb to
toe weak side in our Constitution and the danger which threat
en«it at tl e pret>< ntcusis And on this topic I^ropc^eto ad
diess the eomn ittee
Mr Chauman, 1 wish to Wake up the slumbering spirit of
the Constitution The question^ I mean to discuss are diy, n
gid pi maples of constitutional right They do not weilalmit,
nor shall I attempt to give to them, any ihetoncal embellish
mtnf It may be unwelcome to the members of the House—
I fear the f (institution m us text ind its lettei, is not thecho en
study ot all of us—that we do not, as we «should, according to
the ciaste injmic ion, turn ovei itsleaves with mehtly and daily
handling—that we do not sufficiently cheribh, m oui eveiy
thought, thibTNew Testament of out political faith, and it is
under the impulse of «tionsr con\ ictton ofs^lemn but notgrate
ful, pub ic dut) thai pioceed to pie^ the eubjectupon the at
tendon of the House
Soroepiehmmaiy explanation^ are needful to the right un
derstanc'ins of my views
Inthefiiot place I de=ne to banish fiom my mind all feelings
of mere party prejudice, which is too pi one to color the judg
ment, even as to constitutional points ai isms in the discussion
of great measure-, of public policy I disclaim therefore n
the lemaiksTshah make all imputation upon the motives of
men I peiceive gentlemen all around me, whom, m the rela
lations of ordinary life, I know tobe honorable and jim and I
do not I will not, I canno* dtny to them that widely as we
diffei in opimen on the lmpouant questior«* which sunoundus
they act from sincere belief m the wisdom and hones \ of the
public mesuues they defend And m return I claim at thar
hands the same candidconsnuction of my own opinions
In the second place, I admit, and emphatically maintain the
excellence of our ptcuhar institutions of Government—their^u
penonty, theoretically and practically, to tho^e of any other
country on earth, be that other which it ma) I devoutly be
heve this I inculcate this at all time=: and places I denounce
and repudiate, here and every where that extravagance of op
pos'tion to tht particular administration of the Tederal Govern
mem, which degenerates occasionally into weak doubt,orstu
pid uneoiibcinusnesb, ef the admirdbie and excellent qualities
of the Federal Government itself
There is hot, in my ©pinion* a single one of the principal Go-
vernments of Europe, so stable m «self, or bo fruitful of peace
and prosperity to the sublets of It, as that of the United States
Theie is not one wHch, m the last fifty years, has trodftfjgoae (fo
little change of organisation as that of the United States *fhéíe
is not one \\ hich has experienced less of cfvrl cornmotiort or oY
national war Duiing the fifty years that tfiis ©overnment fias
subsisted undei the Tederal constitution, what agiíatíon, wha¿
disasters, what sargumary wars, domestic and foreign, hsfté ñíít
the great powers qí Europe gone through' I will not dwell on
cases lure that of France? where, during that period, one consii
tution of Government has cnaseS after anothei, shifting, in
troubled succession, like the images oí a phantasmagoria, nor
of ¡Spain, at this moment ravaged, torn astindei, by a deat !y
civil vvar, *n which, it is said, some handled thousand sotiís hafe
been out off in the brtef space of three or four years, not of
the continent of Em ope generally, overrun, once and again, Vf
foieien armies, and the theatre oí almost nerpetéal revúlution
Take, instead, the case of our father land—of tírfeat Éntain-^
the íreest ind at the &ame time the peacefulest (mterMlly) Of
tlie Vowej - of Europe—that which, in the nature of its instill
lions, is the nearest analogy to ouibelves, and I say uf Gieat
Butain, that the single measure of the Reform BUI is a gieatei
cnange in us constitution, and the discussions and plans con-
nected with and consequent upon that measure, indicate gieater
it\ tabthty\n the institutions of that country, than anything
whatever which has, m the same period, transpired in the
United States 1 beJiev  this I know it And i maintain th«f
it is the mere exaggerate of morbid discontent to compare
any of the evils— tuvial m themselves, hut serious in relation
to oui keen sense of maladmimstiation arising from the super-
lative goodness of our institutions—it is mere extravagance to
compare any ol these evils to those which befall other* of
the chief States of Christendom
At the tame time, defects, abuses, en ore of administration,
coiruption^ are incident to our Government, or to every thing
human, and it is our duty to investigate t ese, to endeavor to re
move and guard agamstthera and, by continual vigilante, to
mamta-n the puutyand integrity of the Constitution Actuated
by the«e sentiments m the remai bs I am about 'omake, I affirm
I concede nothing to the disciadi* of the Federal Government, as
a Government                                                      ,
1 hebe thmgfe being pi em i&ed, I proceed to theaiain subject
which I have to submit to the consideration of the House
To begin, let me recur to the fundamental principles of the
Government ltisa Government oí consent—of consentof the
whole constituent People—and a Government framed in theaim
to secuie to all the component parts a perfect equality of lights
and pnvilege« It was constituted to secure and guard the
i igbta of the membei s of it, not to create or confer those rights,
which lights aie altogether antecedent in point of existence, and
supeiior m point of sanctity, to the Constitution, which is but
the social compact of the sovereign constituent People, and sub
)ect to be modified or annulled by them as such They, the con
sii'uent Peoplt aie the sovereigns, not in name oi the lettei of
the text only, but in piactical iact lhe ¡ridmdualsactually en-
gaged m tl e admini'-tr uion, and to the eye constituting the Go
vernment aiv but the tempoiary elected agents oí the People,
ejseicistng specific functions, lawfully conferred on them by the
People, and lebponsibleto the Teople foi the faithful discbarge
of a solemn ti ust confided to them foi the geneial good In short,
the Government is a representative Democracy—Democratic in
its basis, repre-emative m it& foimsof action
These general principles are manifestly the very elementa of
the Constitution, the opening sentence oí which sets foVth the
ugt t upon winch it stands liWe, the Peopl* of the United
States, m oidei to form a moic peifect union, establish justice,
ensure domestic trarquilhty, provide for the common defence,
promote the general welfare, pi d secuie the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and oui posíeiny, do oidain ana establish tjits
Constitution of he United Stairs of America " Woids, full
oí that pure and simple dignity which ehaiactenzes tie whole
instrument' And although in the original Constitution of the
United States itself there lb no specification of the abstract prin
ciples on which it is founded—the absence of which was one of
the objections uiged at the time against i*, and which werem
¡art ¡supplied in the ernendments thereof subsequently adopt
ed—yet those principles were not the less dibtmcily recognised
and established b> the Constitution, inasmuch as the constituent
People, who framed and sanctioned it, were already associated
m political communitiet, as citizens of the several States com
poking the Union, and associated by foims of government,
which, either expressly or by necessary implication, admitted
and asserted the rights of self government, and of revolution as
the mean's ot obtaining oi exercising self government, solemnly
claimed by the thirteen Colonies m the Declaration of Indepea
dence
These being the views which Í emei tain of the nature of the
Government of the United Spates, I concur with the gentleman
fiom Ohio [Mi DiNCAN]in reprobating, as he has this morning
done, the of mions pu( forth m some quarters, in reference to the
revoluMonary rr ovemen s which aie agitating at this time the
remaining British Colonies in Noith America I hold that the
people of Canada have a right to be fiee and lndtpendent of
Gieat Britain, if they cheosc it and this not merely because
Canada is a conquer ed country, acquired and held by ¡orce, but,
in addition thereto, because oí that identical right oí self govern
ment, m virtue of which the old thirteen Colonies challenged
and secured tl en senaiation from the mother country I hold
that you cannot discriminate between the two cases by any dis
miction oi principle whatever And I have been vexed,
shocked alarmed to peiceive thit some few accredited and
respectable presses in ceitam parts of the United States, not con-
tent with having the Federal Government abstain asa Govern-
ment from any breach of if reutrahty on thi15 occasion, and the
citizens individually from any violation of the laws enforcing
that neutraluv, have endeavored to discourage and repress the
spontaneous, jue-t, lawful, and honoiable sympathies of tlus
nation in behiUof men emulating the illustrious example of
our own forefathers b; the promulgation of sentiments which
impliedly deny and lepudiate the very elemental doctrines of
¡he Constitution of the United States, and of e\ery one of die
individual States
As a mart 1 fee! such sentiments to be tcrong, subversive of
the dearest human lights, and prejudicial to the cause of truth
and civilization
As an American, I know ¡hem fo be in diminution of the
text and the spirit of our laws both fundamental and munici
pal  ana countei   to the established theory of the American
Republic
Ab a Whig, I beiiete that it is precisely such sentiments—a
