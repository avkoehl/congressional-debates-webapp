ATLEE'S FARM,

Near Darby Road, October 28, 1864 - 9.15 a. m.

Major-General WEITZEL:

You will withdraw to your former position. I think a shorter and better way is to withdraw in the rear of Ames' line by the nearest road. This movement will be made quietly but promptly, covering your rear and flanks.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,White's Tavern, October 28, 1864 - 9.20 a. m.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

I am taking my position as quick as I can. Before I can tell anything about my line I must cut roads through the woods to see where they will come out. I expect to join Terry's right some time to-day. At present time I straddle the Charles City road. As soon as I do join Terry's right, my right flank, although refused, can be easily turned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER:

I have just got in. My troops are all inside of our line. I left the Darbytown road as soon as one of Terry's aides reported to me that he was all right. I moved from the Charles City road literally as your ordered it, and in the only military way such a movement should be made. I understand that somebody at Terry's understood it differently.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE A. KENSEL:

General Heckman tells me that a Tenth Corps surgeon has circulated a report that my column was repulsed at Williamsburg road, routed, that it lost artillery, &amp;c., and other lying reports. I have ordered his name to be ascertained, then I will report him.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 28, 1864. (Received 6.30 p. m.)

General WEITZEL:

The Army of the Potomac accomplished nothing yesterday. As regards the matter of your movement to-day, it was all straight. The general will explain to you the circumstances when you both meet.

GEO. A. KENSEL,

Chief of Staff.
