Honorable E. M. STANTON,

I have in confinement 2 officers and 23 men, being the party who captured the revenue cutter Caleb Cushing last night. My force is too small to guard them. I await instructions.

WAR DEPARTMENT, June 27, 1863-6. 20 p. m.

Major GEORGE L. ANDREWS,

Fort Preble, Portland, Me.:

Call upon the city authorities to raise a volunteer guard for the immediate exigency. If the Governor of Maine is at Portland, apply to him to raise a sufficient force for temporary guard [duty], until arrangements can be made to transfer them to Fort Warren. In the meantime, place them in irons, and at every hazard prevent their escape. Send me the Governor's address.

Governor COBURN, Augusta, Me.:

It is reported to this Department by Colonel George L. Andrews, commandant of Fort Preble, that his force is not sufficient to guard the rebel pirates that cut out the Caleb Cushing. You will please organize a company of volunteers for temporary guard duty until the pirates can be taken to Fort Warren, or otherwise disposed of, unless it is already done by the authorities of Portland, upon whom Colonel Andrews was, in your absence, directed to call.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
