The number of regiments to be dismounted to be determined by the number of dismounted men of the long-termed organizations.

A like revocation was also ordered for other armies and departments, provided the said order of June 5 had not been executed.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, No. 119. Washington, June 29, 1865.

PENALTIES FOR NEGLECT OF DUTY AND DISOBEDIENCE OF ORDERS ON THE PART OF COMMISSIONED OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF TROOPS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED THE SERVICE.

In many instances delays have resulted in paying mustered-out troops in consequence of regimental and company officers allowing their men to disband, in violation of orders, prior to their commands being reported for payment and final discharge to the chief mustering officer or his assistant, after arrival at the designated State rendezvous. In other cases there has been delay from company and regimental officers neglecting to furnish full date relative to the enlisted men, thus rendering the muster-out rolls imperfect and necessitating corrections.

With the arrangements of the War Department, as now completed, there need be no delay, and consequently no hardship or inconvenience to the enlisted men, if full date for the rolls be furnished in the field, and if, after arrival in their respective States, as well as during transit thereto, commissioned officers look closely after the comfort and interests of their men and remain constantly with them, so as to enforce orders and control them.
