action and a reserve at hand. They think I had 3,000 in action, when there were not quite half that number. They are quarreling about my return, saying the fate of Morgan ought to have been ours. They pursued to Big Spring with advance at Elkwater. I think they will give it up.

Major GIBSON,

Buckhannon:

From all I can learn, I think you alone are able to handle any force Jackson may send in by the way of Centreville. He certainly can send no artillery by that route. However, I may be mistaken in the intentions of the enemy. Their principal force is yet in my front. As soon as I am convinced that the movement toward Buckhannon is not a feint, you shall be re-enforced.

I desire you to keep me constantly informed. Remember that your men can fight pretty well. Let me know when you receive your ammunition.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Commanding Dept.:

Dispatch received. I have been acting upon the idea which Colonel Campbell's report conveys. Imboden may scatter his forces upon my communications. One of his men, on his way to capture our mail, was taken in Tucker day before yesterday. I have 25 men after 2 officers and 15 men in the same vicinity. Also scouts to Petersburg, Crab Bottom, and in front. Jackson has been reported by several parties as at Marling's Bottom. Four deserters, just in, report the same. Jenkins reported at Crab Bottom. Have sent to inquire about him. I want some Linden and Burnside carbine ammunition. It may be on the way. I regret that the Seneca route is blockaded. A short communication is thus destroyed. I will cut it out if you think proper. I shall be ready to move to the front again as soon as some horses are furnished.
