the most of their fortunate acquisition1 Whoencouiage f them
to treat the deposites as an increase of capital1 Who canned
loans and circulation lo be lashly augmented^ Sir, the Mes
sage itself answeis—"the Governmen, from the commence
mem of this connection1'" He needed not to stop to consider
on whom the patronage wasconferied, the Government sane
tien was given to all this monstrous abuse of public trust, f r
reasens best known to him who now site m the Presidential
chair,—leasons which he will never mention, if nobody else
doe ! How piofligate though, and insolent, must that man be,
who first stimulates another to the he ght of intoxication and
madness, foi purposes of base profit, and then turns upon his
victim and tool, and derides and denounces him to the world'
Such is the conduct of "tLe Government"—the Ex and the
In President of the United States, towards the deposite banks'
The increase of cnculatiun, leans, and discounts was rather an
effect than a cause Money was made plenty by the at tien of
the Government Money plenty—there was a dome tic de
mand for credit, which caused domestic debt, and the same
cause produced our foreign debt, ond large importations—our
speculations in public lands, and in every species of property
The Government officers especially were interested and en
ga^el deeply and fraudulent!}, in th se verv land speculation*
and the improvident extravagance of the Government in an
propn vtmg immense sums to public works, drew off more
labor f-om agriculture than all the private speculations of the
nation could have done The whole system tended anil ope
ratel 1> hallucinate the public mind and tocouuptthe public
morals Cruel, indeed, is it no less to the people than to the
pet ba iks, to blame them with effects proceeding dnectly from
the mal administration of the Government In no other point
of view are they to be blamed for their participation in the
wrong than for hiving ti usted their ere it interest and their
liberties to such abandoned and insolent rulers' The system of
the Government was not limited to the banks, it did stimulate
"a general rashness of enterprise and aggravated the fluctúa
tions of commerce and currency "
But the President takes comfort in his misfoiiunes from
companionship in grief—from al eged distresses m other c inn
tries     He «ays
"It has since appealed Ih it evils similai to those suffered by
ourselves, have been .xpoiienced in Great liiuain on Hie con

"The bank in this situation restricted neithei the length of
time which paper had to run, nor diminished the amount of
hei di-counts She delivere 1 up to the circulation one hundred
and ei°fit millions ofspecie, ai d discounted four hundreland
fifty millions in six months She maintained at four pel cent
the rate of her ínteres', when tlusiinut had been exceeded by a
jteat part of Europe    It is thus that she was able to ai i est or
to cherck a movement which seemed to be assuming a seuous
aspect
' But m oidei to accomplish this, she was obliged to have
recourse to extraordinary precautuns The specie on hand
decreased rapidly, it was necessary to replace this reduction
The bank purchased eight millions of gold at Pai is, she drew
from abroad 10 800 000 li ancs m silver bullion The pi emium
expended in procuring the gold will sooner or later be made
up The operation on the bullion occ ¡stoned a loss of 105 000
fiancs This loss has been in some measure recompensed by
more abundant discounts, but even had it been impossible te
obtain any compensation, this consideration would not hav
prevented the Council fi om taking that couise it would equally
have adopted it without hesitation, inasmuch as it was impe
riously called foi by the lnteres's of commerce, a fact which it
now frankly declares to you thiough my lnstiumentabty
"The interests of commerce, gentlemen are theiefore mti
mately allied to yours The aggregate of the dividends ot 1836
have given you a pioof  f it You itceived in 1834 but 80
francs, and in 1835 98 the year 1836 gives you 112 francs
This is the highest annual dividend that has been declared since
the creation of the bank "
So much for the pieisure in Britain and on the continent of
Europe Indeed, sir I believe the fact was, though I am not
confident in stating it to be so, that cotton actually fell in New
Orleans before advices were received of a fall m Liverpool '
This is an unexampled fact if it were so, that produce should
fall at the place of expoitation before it was known that prices
had diminished at the market of sale' The fact might well be
so, owing to the failures of our own meichants and the total
want of exchanges at home I have endeavored to ob am accu
rate information as to this fact I have only the information,
however contained in Mr Raguet's communication m the
National Gazette ol the 14th of September la-t undei the sit
nature of "An Examiner " and a letter from an intelligent
gentleman of Philadelphia to a friend assuies me that ' the
heavy failures m New Orleans (Hermann, Buggsand Co etc 1
took place about the end of February, oi the 1st oi 2d of
March I his was shortly before the bad news was received
fiom Liverpool "
But, sir there were other causes of tins catastrophe ptoceed
ing from the action of the Government, besides the increase of
banking capit d circulation loans and discounts, besides fo
rei«n and domestic oebts and the other causes enumerated m
the Message Besides tht importation of some ten millions of
silver dollars from abroad which commenced with the removal
of the deposites in Oclobei, 18a3 and continued until luly,
1834, and "which would not have been imported in the oidma
jy course of tiade," and winch, in part menased the issues,
loans and discounts of banks, and the debts consequently of in
dividtnls I prot fed to enumerate the "gold bill" as one of the
most prominent arts of "the Government" which caused pres
sine abroad as well as at home Ivotulfoi thatbil!, and then,
foie owe an apology for my vote The lest apology I can
make i- the only one which the friends of the Admmi (ration
can make foi it—I ask forgiveness, tor I knew not what I did'
Tht paity and tht President were bent on the glory of old to in
creise its amount in the country was "apart of the system ' I
could not at the tune see how the exchange in part of asilver for
a pold basis would in|ure us ihotHi I confess I did not under

that more than one means which wei e selected to make the ex

mannei in which it has done so is clearly dt inonstrated m the

compelled eighty private banks to suspend was not felt m the
United States as a general pressure tor money, although many
commercial disasters resulted from a fall m the price of cotton,
in which article heavy speculations had been entered into * An
other proof is tobe found m the condition of Great Biltain dur
lngthepenod of General Jackson's panic ahove leferred to
Whilst we drew from htr neai four millions of silver dolíais in
the course of a year, it produced no pressure for money m the
London market   The wi iter remembers noticing tint fact at the
time of its occurrence and he is foi túnate in being able to sus
tain it by evidence which will not be disputed    In the renin of
the Secre.ary of the Treasury, which has been heretofore as
sumed as authorl y formostof his calculations there is a table
giving 'the aggregate amount of notes circulated in England
and Wales, by the Bank of England, by puvate banks, and by
joint stock banks and their branches,' at the following dates
December 28, 1833, when the amount was jE2',621 104
March       29, 1834,            do           do           28,735,827
June          28  1834,            do           do           29 207,652
'The importations of dollars from England to the United
States commenced m November, 1833, one month after Ihe re
moval ofthe deposites, and continued until July, 18 4, when the
news ofthe passage of ihe gold bill leached that country, and
yet we find tint, between the 28th of Decembei, 1833, and the
28th of lune, lc34 he currency of England, solar from having
been contracted m consequence of that importation, was posi
tively mcieased more than seven millions and a half of dolíais,
estimating the pound sterling at $4 80 This arose from the
circumstance that silver dollars were, in England mere anieles
of merchandise and the abstraction of a few millions of them
could produce no more effect upon the currency of Great Bri
tarn than the exportation of an equal value in iron 01 lead, diy
goods or hardware
"But this was not all The steadiness ofthe English currency
prevented a fall fiom taking place in the prices of cotton and
other American produce, which would have occasioned gnat
loss to the Amcricansluppeis whilst, at the same time, it enabled
British capitalists to extend lelief to our merchants by the ac
ceptance of bills of exchange, or by shipments ofspecie
"By the gold bill, enacted on the 2Sth of June, 1834, the rela
five value of gold and silver was changed, so as to rendei an
ounce of gold the equivalent of about sixteen ounces of silver
Anolli*r law was passed on Ihe same day, declaring certain
foreign coins a legal tender, one of the effects ef which was to
make the Rtittsh sovereign, 01 gold'pound sterling, equal in
value to about 84 87J of American cuirency, and the joint
effect of the two was to render eold the preferred metal 011 all
occasions wheie importations ofspecie fiom Europe were call
ed foi the opeiations of commerce From the date of the pas
sage of these laws the shipments fiom Europe were oidered to
be made in gold instead of silver t and the consequence wa°, that
this demand reaching the coffers of the Bank of England, the
great repository of gold m Turopc produced an immediate
effect upon the currency of Gre.t Bntain bv compelling the
b inks to contract tiVn issues Hence w e find, by the Secreta
ry s table above referred to, that a conttaction took place in the
circulation of bank notes in England and Wales, so that, on the
27th of September 1834, the amount was reduced to £28 591 112
and on the 28th of Decembei to £27,7<9,828, being a diminution
of upwai ds of seven millions of dollars
"From these facts supported by the documental y evidence
of the Treasury Department as well as by sound leason, it is
manifest that the passage ol the gold bills identified the British
and American currencies, and rendered each for ever thereafter
liable to ba mfluerced bv the other Expansions and contrac
tions can now hardly fall to be simultaneous, and henceforth,
more than at the period when the sentence was first pronoun
ced by Mr Gorham m Congress, must it he true, that 'the
1 arometer of the American money marlet hantrs up at the

eanno' fail to exci'e over ^sues bv the An 1 rican banks, for, as
Great Butain is the country m which almost all our e\rhanse
tran«acti ns with the world are concentrated, if the Biittm

ofthe Continent we shall feel its effects ¡n our currency,
without being able to detect it ' ^hall feel ' did I say? We do
already fri] it and theie cannot be a question that our piesent
peeunniy embariassments have been gieatly augmented by
the operation of this cause, resulting fiom 01 e of Gtneial
