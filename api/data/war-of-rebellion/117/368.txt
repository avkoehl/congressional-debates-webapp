GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS EIGHTH ARMY CORPS, No. 22. Baltimore, Md., August 10, 1862.

No citizens shall be arrested within the limits of this army corps upon charges of disloyalty or treasonable practices unless such charges shall be submitted in writing and the truth of the same selected under oath by the person preferring them, and no such prisoner will be received for confinement by any provost-marshal, marshal of police or commandant of post unless accompanied by the charge above described or a copy of the same.

By command of Major-General Wool:

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, D. C., August 10, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. Army.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose a copy of the New York Tribune of the 29th ultimo giving a list of Union prisoners (citizens) confined at Salisbury, N. C. I inclose likewise a list* of such names from among those prisoners as I learn from reliable sources have been confined simply because they are Union men. I presume most of the others are of the same class. I hold as hostages for the safety of these men about thirty prisoners, citizens of Fredericksburg and that part of Virginia in front of Washington. I trust that you will be able to effect an exchange by which these unfortunate men, some of whom have been held for over a year, will be released.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,[JAMES S. WADSWORTH,]

Brigadier-General.
