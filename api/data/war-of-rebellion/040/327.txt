HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1 1863-2.05 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

I have two deserters just from Hays' brigade, Early's division. they report A. P. Hill left here this morning to move up to our right. Hood's division arrived yesterday from Richmond. The deserter was from New York State originally; an intelligent man. He said he knew it was Hood's division, for he asked the troops as they passed along. He reports D. H. Hill, Early, and Trimble in front of Sedgwick. Anderson, McLaws, A. P. Hill, and Hood would, therefore, be in your front.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1, 1863-2.30 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Chancellorsville, Va.:

The column seen passing here was first discovered at 8.30 o'clock, and ceased to pass at 11.30. The signal man thinks two corps. From appearances, portion of the column diverged to the left before reaching the Orange Plank road.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

MAY 1, 1863-2.45 p. m.

General HOOKER:

All passage of troops from enemy's right to his left ceased about 11.30 o'clock. Nothing apparently going now except small detachments. Gibbon's picket line on right reports withdrawal of enemy's pickets and vedettes out of sight of river.

UNITED STATES FORD,

May 1, 1863-2.25 p. m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

General Hooker directs that you send Graham's Horse Artillery, all of it, twenty-two guns, to report to me at Banks' Ford; also two batteries Napoleons, or, if there are none, two other field batteries, 3-inch, if General Sedgwick can spare them. The latter can be replaced by Hart's and Kusserow's batteries, now with Colonel Warner on Sedgwick's extreme left. They can be replaced by Blucher's 20-pounders, now at the camp of the Artillery Reserve.

Please acknowledge to me here, with substance of this, that I may be sure all is right.

HENRY J. HUNT,

[Brigadier-General.]

UNITED STATES FORD,

General BUTTERFIELD:

Have not yet received your answer; line down. I go to Banks' Ford. Will await Graham there. General Hooker requires me to hold that
