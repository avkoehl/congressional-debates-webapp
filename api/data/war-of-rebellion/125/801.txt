The increase in the manufacturing capacities of the arsenals and armories has already gone far toward supplying the large demand for arms and other ordnance stores, and, in conjunction with private manufactories in this county, has rendered us independent of foreign supplies. The greater accuracy of the manufacture of such stores at the U. S. armory and arsenals of construction, and the more uniform and better quality of the articles so manufactured of such stores at the U. S. armory and arsenals of construction, and the more uniform and better quality of the articles so manufactured, renders it advisable to increase the manufacturing capacity of these establishments to such an extent as will supply all the arms and ordnance stores required for the military service, and which the Government manufactories have the means and the right to fabricate. With this view there was an appropriation made at the last session of Congress, and I have taken measures to apply it to the purpose for which it was designed at each of the arsenals in the manner that will best effect the object and augment and facilitate the operations carried on at each, by such enlargements and additions to the workshops and machinery as experience has shown to be wanted. The capacity of the National Armory at Springfield, Mass., is adequate to the manufacture of 300,000 rifled muskets annually. The arms there made are of the best quality and most approved pattern of muzzle-loading arms, and their cost, including interest on the entire capital invested in the armory, does not exceed $12 per arm, with appendages complete. In pursuance of the provisions of the act approved April 19, 1864, possession has been taken of Rock Island for the purpose of building and maintaining thereon an arsenal or the construction, deposit, and repairs of arms and munitions of war. Some of the requisite buildings for these purposes are under construction, and the residue will be commenced and carried to completion as soon as practicable. There are on hand at this date in the arsenals and armory of the United States, exclusive of arms in the hands of troops, 650,000 rifled muskets of the Springfield pattern, and 100,000 Enfield rifles, making a stock on hand of 750,000 of first-class rifled small-arms for foot troops. Our present stock on hand of carbines for cavalry is but 25,000. We have no Government manufactory of these arms, but
