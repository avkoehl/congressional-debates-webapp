the appointment, and he wouid, therefoie, call the I
yeas and nays noon the question                          I
Mr   WEBSTER said he had voted  for the
charge of the rule in regard to the appointment of
committees with a good deal of reluctarce      It j
appeared to him likely were would be some diffi
culty in making so good a selection in respect to
where pluralities were to prevail     It aopeared to I
him an eaily period to proceed to the consideration I
of impoitant business-   He thought there was
reason in giving time to the absent gentlemen to |
be here, and it is said they will be here    We had
changed the rule—they could not know it, and if i
gentlemen request postponement he thought it
was reasonable and that tné motion should pre- ,
vail                                                                       I
Mr   CLAY      I understand the gentleman to i
say it is early time to proceed to tne appointment
of committees                                                       j
Mr WEBSTER I said it was an eaily period
to take up impoitant business
Mr. CLAY    At no time, he believed, had the I
appointment of committees been delayed beyond
the second week of the session
Mr GRUNDYsaid that the present was anew
casein the Government it was newni this that
the Senate, at the commencement of the session,
had changed an important practice Formerly,
the Presiding Officer appointed the standing com-
mittees, and it was well known that he exeicised
that power The gentlemen absent, theiefore,
had no right to expect that they would be cal'ed
on at this early period of the session to peiform
the duty of choosing the committees
The question of postponement was determined
in the affirmative

After the presentation of sundry petitions,
Mr EVANS, of Mame, reported, from the Com
mittee on Invalid Pensions, a bill granting pen-
sions to certain peisons theiem named,  winch {
was read a first time and ordcied to a second

REMOVAL or THE BANK DEPOSITES         I
The motion submitted yesteiday by Mr POLK |
for the reconsideration of the vote by which the
report of the Secretary oí the Treasury on the re
moval of the deposites was, on Tuesday, reierred
to the Committee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, was taken up                                 I
Mi. CHILTON had no desire to address the I
House on this question when he moved the ad- ¡
journment yesterday But he wished that, on so
important a subject, some time should be aflovded
for reflection, and, after reflection, he had come to
the conclusion that the motion ought to oe resisted
It was not to be presumed that the gentleman
from South Carolina, [Mr McDun-n,] enter ain-
ing, as he did, the opinion that the removal oí the
deposites was an act of usurpation, intended to
suffer a reference of the subject in the usual man
ner He had not understood that gentleman as
assenting to any such course when he made the
motion, and he could not see how the gentleman
froni Tennessee [Mi Polk] could have misun-
derstood his intention He was also surprised at
the remark of the gentleman from Tennessee that
the subject ought to be deliberately approached
and illuminated by rays of light to be shed upon it
by some committee—he was too modest to say the
Committee of Ways and Means There are some
subjects as to which new lights are indispensable,
and as to which it would not be safe to legislate
without investigation. But was this a subject of
that kind? And was there any light which the
Committee of Ways and Means could shed on this
suljeci whicn did rofli ady -hirenpon the Com
miueeof the Whole House' Pnegi nileman must
excuse him it he said, in the words of <~ di m
guished individual of no vei y leñóte am quity,
" some thirds can be ('one xs well as others,"
and "some things c > 11 be done by < me people
as well as by oihers " r or, m lepd, co lid he sit I y
natiently and see tne whole weight of ihis massive
Government imposed on thesliouldeisof nisluend
from Tennessee- He wished, moreovci ,that the
laure's as veil as the lesnonsibihties and labors of
legisla'ion should be divided among the members
He had no doubt, n fine, that this subject could
oe as well examined bvn Committee of the Whole
House as by any standing coinmutee The gen
tleman from Tennessee had sought to smother the
ques ion fbeiewa* something pecuhai in the
chaiacter of his motion It wis made in cnose
quence of the intimation from the member fiom
South Carolina to go i ito the question befoi  the
Commiuee of the Who'e Is not the membe
from'lei nessee satisfied witn tne reasormgot the
Seae ary of the Treasury? Can.ii" imptove unon
iiJ The Secretaiy has male in an issue Will
not the gen tleman abide by it' Everv new light oi
this subject, which had been piesehted to us on this
qiestion, consisted m newspaper scrapings of the
most rrneerab'echaractei He knew what he saij
It was now time to have fur play, and to disabi «e
the public of its delus nns on this sul jer-t We
ought to put a stop to the artifienl excitement
wh oh has been kept up with a view to disten b the
cunency of the countiy and to destioyii msti
tution ot great national utibty HcpleaJed, as an
apology for presenting himself befoie the House
on this question, that it had been tiumpeted in the
ofiiuul organ of theGovernment that all the mem-
bcis who should íaise their voices in favor of the
bank wer^bnbed. He wassensib'e of the hazard,
personally and politically, to which he expo«ed
himself by declaring his sentiments But no man
should desire to outlive the honoi and glory of his
country lie entertained the highest respect for
the genileman from Tennessee His ti lents were
known to the Union He was on excellent te ms
with himself, and his amrcable relations he had no
disposition to disturb
TheSPEAKCR fhe gentleman is discussing
the question of whether the repoit should be sent
to the committee, which is not in ouiei The
question now befóte the [louse is, whether it shall
be brought back into the House, and he will con
fine himself to this
Mi   CÜILTON continued     He was opposed
to therefeiencewhich thegentlem n fiomlennes
see 'eemed to desire, foi  h- knew the resul' of
it wouid ba to prevent any action on the subject
It was wholly unnecessary to íefer the subject at
all
The SPEAKER intetposed, and said it was
not in order to speak to the poirt ot lefeience
The question was on leconsideration
Mi CHILTON O leofthe arguments m favor
of the removal of the í]epo^ tes was t nt thecbai'er
would eApire Could it take is five minutes to
find out whether the charters cf the Stste uai ks
selected aie not also soon to expire But he pio-
ceeded no fuither,ab he might wanoer.m the es l-
mation of the Speaker, fiom the piecise question
befoie the House
Mi   POLK lose only to say tbat th s was the
fiist time that any great sulject of national poi cy
wis ever referred,in 'hefirvt n stance, to ti et om
mittee of the Whole oi the state of the Union    If
we should plunge into the discussion oft!  s ques
tion in the Committee of the Whole theie voul I
benoend toi      If u was necessai y to act speedily
on this «abject i* need not be delayed     Tneic on
of the House would be facilitated by taking the
usual coarse    The Bsnk of the United States
itself ought not toshnnk fiom 'ne in estigstion
which he proposed     But in the Committee of the
Whole this could not be done     The discussion
would be limited to the face tf the papéis mem
selves, and we could bung into  it nothing else
The discussion, too, would occupy days, weeks,
and even months     He insisted  that the House
ought  to  pursue   the usual  and  parliamentary
course    He had nothing more to say
Mr MHECIM called foi the yeas and rays on the
question, which were ordered.
Mi  McDUl TIE said the gentleman's object,
I understand to be, to bung the «ubjtct be'biea
st Hiding comini lee [Mi POLK I hat oi <u y
ot er con mittee the House %vill duc-t ] Í he ob-
ject cou'd not in that way be attained 4 discus-
sion must tike j lace on cveiy pieaenta'ion ot the
question The only fact mv< Ived in the case
which can be re erred is that f«ct i elating to punt-
ing documents Bin. he was willing to admit the
tact ihat the bank defended itself State the sum,
if you pi ase, at fifty, sixty, or a hundied thou-
sind dollars The facts are immitetial They

But the Seo etary ui the JTieasury takes a view of
the transactions of the bank foi five years, and
dneUs a lemovil of the deposites, in the face of
an almost unanimous resolve of this House, and
for leasjns which n ust have ex sted then, if they
evei existed The Secieu ry, unauthorized, nay,
in opposition to the will of Congiess, transfened
il e na1 he t easure fiom the safest institution on
the tace ot the eaith to banks upon whose solvency
in member n the House could pronounc The
gentleman speaks of a sciu my in o the affairs of
tiie bank The bai k, he says, was reluctant to
s and sciutiry Bat thib h id riothmg to do with
the mailer We were to look at it upon fun la-
me ital principles, and had nothing to do with facts
his^aiuthat the fata e banks had leheved the pres-
sure by issuing bills on the credit of the deposites
Wny, childien would not act so imprudently To
flood thecoun i y with currency based on no foun-
dation but the temporaiy and unauthorized de-
posi e of public money in their vaults, was the
veriest piece of folly ever heard of Great embar-
rassments must ensue if we íemove the deposites
from the State banks, but we must do it, if we are
not bound, hand and foot, to the Executive
Mr CAMBRELEN& said he believed this
cj estion depended on great principles connected
with the expiration of the chauei of the United
States Bank He heard with alarm the intimation
tnat the de, osi es sh'ould be restored to the Bank
of the United S ates—the only o' jectof which pio-
cedure must be to force the^renewal of the chai ter
to avoid the embairassments it would create He
was surprised, too, to hear doubts exoressed as to
the solvency of some twenty banks, whose capitals
were n'lnitely largei than the whole íeveuue of
the country Let the gentleman, if he chooses,
introduce his íesolution for the restoration of the
depos t—> He would pledge himself not to shrink
fion the question But the subject of the bank
and the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury
ought, in conformity with ancient usage, to go to
a stending conimittee
Mr BINiN EY understood, he said, that the sole
object o the motion to reconsider, was to delay
the discussion on this subject until it had been
investigated by a committee The mteiest with
which his constituents viewed this question was
his apology for appearing himself so early after
his mtioduction into the House n a discussion.
A I <rge view of'his su1 ject, which could not be
too soon mm, was presented by thegentlemanfrom
South Carolina, and there was a narrower, but
large view, involving the publ c faith, the obliga-
tions, of a con'ract, and the honor of this House
as the guardians of the public fai h The contract
was between the people and the stockholders of
the bank, the latter giving their seivices, and the
formei cer am immunities and the piivilege of the
public deposites The question was submitted to
Ubby thecon'r ctmg parties whether the compact
has been fulfilled f be Secretaiy of the Treasury
had made an award against the bank, and in virtue
of his povvor he had removed the deposites He
now calls upon us to confirm his judgment The
reasons of the officei are placed together with his
power, and his act and his reasons for it come
before us If any írquiry m respect to the bank
was wished, let it be made But let it be prose-
cuted independently of the question of the Secre-
tary's reasons We are here upon a question of
contract What is the object of the inquiry asked
for' Is it to suggest reasons for the Secretary's
act which had not occurred to the Secretary him-
self, and had rot influenced his judgment? If you
bring in other facts, other ji dgment, other reasons,
you annul the judgment of the Secretary, agree
that it was wrong, and assume to exercise an on-
