FORT MONROE, VA.,

April 10, 1863-1 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

A great variety of information from prisoners, deserters, and from intercepted letters confirms the fact that the rebels are in great force on the Blackwater. They have built several bridges, issued four days' cooked rations, &amp;c. An officer from City Point brought news that a great quantity of material had been sent down to the Blackwater. The testimony is too strong to be disregarded. I countermanded the orders for re-enforcements for Foster before any got off. I shall go to Suffolk in the morning.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 10, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

No news from Charleston since telegram of this morning referring to disaster to iron-clad Keokuk. No requisition for transports was made. Shortly after I concluded to re-enforce Foster a steamer came in; others were expected, and by diverting from fair-weather steamers I could send as many troops as I could spare. I telegraphed you that the information obtained to-day induced me to withhold all re-enforcements from Foster. Upon Peck's urgent call I have sent the Hawkins' Zouaves to Suffolk to-day.

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., April 10, 1863.

Major General J. G. FOSTER, or

Brigadier General I. N. PALMER:

SIR: In consequence of your application for re-enforcements I have detached Brigadier-General Terry with a brigade of about 3,000 men-all that can possibly be spared from this department-with orders to proceed by sea to New Berne. A deficiency of vessels is causing delay in the departure of the troops. I would have sent them yesterday if possible, and the first installments are now embarking on steamers fit only for calm waters. I send these troops, which are so much needed in this department, for the purpose of relieving General Foster at Washington, N. C. If General Foster shall have been relieved or released, or if Washington shall have fallen on the arrival of General terry at New Berne, I have directed him to return with his brigade forthwith to this place. In any event I shall anticipate their return in a very short time, as the enemy now threaten us on the Blackwater and elsewhere in great force.

One of the steamers sent is the Thomas A. Morgan, the mail-boat and transport between Fort Monroe and Yorktown. I desire that the Morgan may be returned here in the least possible time.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General, Commanding.
