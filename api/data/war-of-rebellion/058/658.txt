Resolved, second, That while we are willing to make all needful sacrifices for the sake of thee glorious cause in which we are battling, and while we intend to endure unmurmuringly to the end all necessary hardships and privations, we feel that it is not asking too much of our Government to require subsistence at its hands as a remuneration for our services, and we hope that our action will not be viewed as dictatorial, but as an earnest appeal to the wisdom of our legislative department upon a subject which materially affects the welfare not only of ourselves but of the whole country.

Resolved, third, That a copy of these resolutions and preamble be at once forwarded, through the proper channels, to the Senate and House of Representatives of the Confederate States.

JAMES J. TURNER,

Lieutenant-Colonel Thirtieth Tennessee, President of Meeting.
