COLUMBIA, TENN., April 1, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

My advance is two days' march from here. I shall be with it in two days. The rear starts to-morrow I expect to concentrate at Savannah Sunday or Monday. The telegraph will keep up with us, but I apprehend some difficulty in keeping it open; the enemy's cavalry will have somewhat easy access to it from Florence. I would suggest the employment of a fleet steamer, to be used as an express boat. Our mail cannot come securely by any other route than the river.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
