of Elk River to put it in order for wagons. Instruct the regiment as follows: Let the loose stone ballast be thrown out from the track against the walls of the tunnel on each side so as to clear a wagon way; then if the floor of the tunnel is found rough and covered with sharp points of stone dirt must be hauled in and the inequalities covered and the road bed made smooth. Good approaches to the tunnel should be made, and a turn-out constructed at each end by planking, as at a road crossing. One regiment should be detailed with its teams. It should go well provided with picks and shovels. The work can be done in one day if the regiment work diligently.

General NELSON, Camp near Athens:

The commissary at Athens is ordered to issue but one day's rations at a time. All in excess of this is necessary to keep the troops in advance alive. Do not therefore interfere with this order. You must also send all the men called for by Colonel Hunton to assist in repairing the railroad. Our existence depends on the early completion of that road from Reynolds' Station down to Elk River.

Direction to operator: Copy of this to Colonel Hunton.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

The telegram from Colonel Hunton asking for a detail reached me last night at 12 o'clock. The Thirty-first Indiana Regiment marched this morning to Elk River to answer calls for details. By the orders the commissaries and quartermasters at the deport here are acting under my division is in absolute want for rations. I should like such orders to be given as would enable them to supply me as well as the division beyond.
