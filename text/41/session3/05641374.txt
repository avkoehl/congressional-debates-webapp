The SPEAKER protempore. Thegentleman
from Arkansas will be confined to fifteen min-
utes, in order that all who desire to speak may
be heard.
Mr. ROGERS. Mr. Speaker, the bill under
discussion is one reported" from the Commit-
tee on Education and Labor, of which I am a
member. I examined this bill carefully when
in committee, and could not give it my sup-
port. After having given it further examina-
tion since then, I am still unable to give it my
support.
In the first place, Mr. Speaker, the measure
is unconstitutional, it is opposed to our theory
of government as well as to .the Constitution.
I believe something ought to be left and is
left by our Government to the local authorities
of the country to regulate, and therefore I
believe, sir, that Congress has no power like
that claimed under tins bill. But even if we.
had the power, I do not think it would be good
policy to embark in any project of this kind.
But., sir, if 1 could believe that this bill was
constitutional I could not vote for it because
of iis cumbrous and expensive macbine.ry. it
is a bill, to my judgment, wholly impractica-
ble, a bill the provisions of wliich cannot be
put into successful operation in this country,
it is a bill which, it seems to me, strikes down
all the rights of the States and centers an
additional power in the Federal Government
here at Washington city.
Now, sir, having said this much in general,
allow me to call attention to the fifth section
of the bill. What does it provide? That there
shall be superintendents appointed for the
various States. There is to be a general super-
intendent, and then other superintendents
acting under him. These local superintend-
ents are to go abroad in the land and select
such sites for schools as they may think proper
and report on the same tt> the general super-
intendent ; and if the latter shall approve the
selection, then the sites are to be taken,whether
the parties owning the land shall consent or
object. I ask, whether it is not a monstrous
proposition. But it goes on further to provide
that as soon as the property is selected, and
belore being reported to the general super-
intendent, it shall vest in the United States
Governmen t.
Thus, sir, you propose to enter my posses-
sions, to euter my lot in a city or my plantation
in the country, to take possession of it; and
just so soon as you take possession of it under
this bill the title to it inures to the Govern-
ment of the United States, and my only rem-
edy is before a commission appointed by the
superintendents in their interest; and by their
decision the value of this property is to be
assessed and I am to be paid for it accord-
ingly. Now just look at the proposition. Is
there a sensible man anywhere who would
allow, under our form of government in this
once free Government, any man to come into
his yard and enter upon his premises and
divest him of his rights simply by seizing upon
his property and vesting it in the United States?
The idea to me, sir, seems to be preposterous,
and does away with all security ot property
in this country under the laws and under the
Constitution.
But, sir, I have another objection to the bill.
What does the sixth section provide? It pro-
vides that these superintendents shall prescribe
the school-books that shall be used in the
schools established in the various States. Just
look at that proposition! It has been my
lot to know something of the sharp practices
of men both North and South, and I say the
result will be that the superintendent will be-
come connected with some publishing estab-
lishment and no books will be allowed to come
iuto the schools under his control unless they
come from the publishing establishment in
which he is a partner; that will be the effect of
this provision in the sixth section, which gives
the superintendent the power to prescribe the
character of the books to be used, to prescribe
every particular book that may be used in the
public schools. And yet, sir, gentlemen upon
this floor claiming to be American citizens,
born in the; sunlight of liberty, come up here
with a proposition of this sort and say that I
shall not have the right to buy such books as
I please from which to educate my children.
They press this scheme upon the attention of
the House and of the country and ask tne and
every person upon this floor to support this
monstrous proposition.
I have seen something of the sharp practice
in large cities, both North and West. I have
understood something of the calculations they
have made. And while I do not believe that
my friend from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar]
intended any such effect by incorporating this
section in tire bill, yet under it I can see that
monstrous wrongs will grow up.
But, sir, I do not intend to discuss the pro-
visions of the bill. I may say that but for the
remarks of my friend from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Hoar,] my colleague upon this committee,
I do not know that I should have said a word
upon the subject at all, although I felt that it
was my duty to say something in regard to the
provisions to which I have called attention.
In urging upon the House the necessity for
this bill my friend from Massachusetts tells
the House and tells the country that the people
South are a set of semi-barbarians, a set of
savages, and that we are called upon, if we
would perpetuate the public institutions of this
country, to educate those people, because they
will not educate themselves.
I know, sir, that my friend from Massa-
chusetts would not knowingly do an injustice
to the people of any section of this country.
But, sir, the very proposition to pass a bill of
this kind is an insult to the people of the sec-
tion where I live. Why, if I were to get up
here and talk to my friend about the burning
of witches and other practices and institutions
in the olden times of the people of Massachu-
setts, and those from whom they descended,
would he not rise in his seat to defend his sec-
tion against such aspersions, and to protest
against the wrong done to his people by state-
ments of that kind? I have seen him—and I
admired his pluck when he did so—when lie
rose and defended the people of his State-
again st attacks made from the other side of
the Honse. Then I ask him if he can feel in
his heart that I should not to night speak for
the section of country in which I live; that I
should not speak for the right, for God, and
for my country ? I know he cannot.
In speaking upon the subject of the ne-
cessity of education in the South he reft-ried
to the State of Arkansas, and as a mm wl.c 
lives there, born in an adjoining Stale, and
emigrating there many years ago. 1 feel with
those people all that they feel, and expect to
share in their prosperity and as their Rep-
resentative upon this floor, 1 cannot let this
subject pass without calling attention to the
remarks of the honorable gentleman. Whit
are they? in speaking of' the school sy.-teai
he said that "in Arkansas the school siste'n.
in spite of white hostility, is more succfs-.ful
than in most of the southern States " Now 1
know, as I have said, that my friend dof-s no:
want to misrepresent; 1 am satis-iied of that:
but he has been badly imposed upon. Now, !
tell him that two thirds of the voters in the
State of Arkansas are white men, and b,n
one third colored men. Now, if the school
system has been put in operation at all, I a:-!;
him if it has not been done by the white men
in that State? How, then, can it, be said that
the white men in that State are opposed to the
school system and to education in that State'.'
The gentleman can refer to the census to ;-ee
if I ain correct when I state that two thirds of
the voters of that State are white men and one
third black. You do not think we have a
minority government there, do you? You do
not believe that the black men in that State
rule the State, do you? If you do, you are
very much mistaken. But let me tell you that
the white men of that State made that law, and
it is the white men that are paying the taxes t.
support the schools that you say are doing bet-
ter than many of the schools in the southern
States. So much for the allubiou to Arkansas
by my friend.
Mr. HOAR. Will the gentleman be kind
enough to inform the House whether the
school system in that State, which ! said was
better than that in many of the other south-
ern States, has met with hostilities from any
quarter?
Mr. ROGERS. The present system?
Mr. HOAR. Yes, sir.
Mr. ROGERS. Yes, I will. I am glad my
friend has called my attention to that point.
Mr. HOAR. I would like to ask the gentle-
man if that hostility is tiom the blacks?
Mr. ROGERS. I shall come to that point
and answer the question, I think, to your satis-
faction. The school system which has been
adopted there, adopted almost in a time of
revolution, is an expensive, cumbrous, and
unprofitable one. We have sought from time
to time to amend and correct that system so
that it shall not be so burdensome either to
