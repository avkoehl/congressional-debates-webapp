HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Atlanta, Ga., September 29, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military DIVISION of the Mississippi:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of this date. I have ordered the brigade of Garrard's DIVISION now at the railroad bridge to Sweet Water Creek, instructing the commanding officer to receive orders from General Kilpatrick and notified the latter. General Kilpatrick reports that the enemy has pickets on Sweet Water, and that he is watching their movements; has nothing more to confirm General Howard's suspicions. This information he gave me before your note was received. General Garrard assures me that he will lose no time to have his command ready. I have again urged him to hurry his shoeing and be ready. I will endeavor to do all that it is possible to do. General Kilpatrick's information is not often reliable.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.

ATLANTA, September 29, 1864.

General GARRARD:

Get ready as soon as you can, if possible in less time than three days; send the regiment to some point east of and near Marietta, as you suggested; it should not have a fixed camp but rather cover Marietta by scouting leisurely. Which is the better road to Sweet Water town, that on right bank of Chattahoochee by Vining's, or to cross river at Sandtown? You or some of your officers have traveled both roads. Report when ready.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Atlanta, Ga., September 29, 1864.

Major S. HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Cumberland:

General Garrard informs me that "the bridge at Vining's is reported down and cannot be crossed," and that "the bridge at Sandtown is in very bad condition, and it is doubtful if it will stand long. " If the bridge first mentioned is not the one near the railroad it is not material, but I request that engineer troops may be directed to see that the bridge near the railroad and that at Sandtown is put in order; a movement ordered to be made within the next three days makes it necessary to use the two bridges.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
