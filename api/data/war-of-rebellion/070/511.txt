HEADQUARTERS ADVANCE, May 21, 1864.

[Captain PHILIP G. BIER,Assistant Adjutant-General:]

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to state that I have received dispatch requesting me to send a strong scouting party of infantry to Powell's Fort Valley. The fords are impassable for infantry, and I think for cavalry. Captain Ellicott started with fifty cavalry for that point this morning. He was unable to cross at Banks' Ford, and left there for a ford farther up stream, in order to cross if possible, since which time I have not heard from him. There is no possible mode of crossing infantry, except by a small skiff,which will carry but a few men. If the cavalry have been able to cross, they are there by this time. Under these circumstances, I have deemed it proper to delay attempting to cross the men in the skiff until the facts can be stated to the commanding general.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding.
