Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

An order, with an officer to see it enforced, should go to Missouri to send from there all the troops not actually after Price and guards for public stores to General Thomas, telegraphing Thomas to know at what points he wants them. Memphis now looks to me as if it was in danger.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

From a scout in from the vicinity of Monroe to-night I have rather meager information, but it goes to show that troops, consisting of mounted infantry, cavalry, and artillery (eight pieces), have recently come in from the direction of Texas and passed northward from Oak Ridge, on Saturday last. The report is that it was known as Lee's command, and consisted of eight regiments of Texans.

Very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.

All trade and traffic outside of your pickets will be stopped. It will require vigilance to do so, and I expect you to use your best endeavors to close this outlet.

Your obedient servant,
