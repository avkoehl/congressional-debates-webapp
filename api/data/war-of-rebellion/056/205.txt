BLAIN'S CROSS-ROADS, November 20, 1863-7 a.m.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX:

Citizens report that there are from 80,000 to 100,000 rebels around Knoxville. Firing ceased at dark last evening. Steady and heavy firing during the afternoon. Rebel pickets all around the town.

Very respectfully,

F. W. GRAHAM.

No signs of an attack in the rear. I shall go forward.

Brigadier-General.
