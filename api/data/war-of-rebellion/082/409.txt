Washington for further orders. Early is undoubtedly returning here to enable the enemy to detach troops to go to Georgia. Hunter's troops must be tired. I would say, therefore, for him to take up such of the advanced positions suggested by him as in his judgment will best protect the line of the Potomac. If Wright and Hunter have started after the enemy with the view of following on the road from Charlottesville to Gordonsville let them go.
