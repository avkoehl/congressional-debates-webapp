WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, April 2, 1865-11 a.m.

The PRESIDENT,

City Point:

Mrs. Lincoln arrived safely this morning. General Augur's headquarters were burned up last night; whether the fire was caused by negligence or design is unknown. I congratulate you and General Grant upon the prospect of great success. Every one is eager for news.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, VA., April 2, 1865-11 a.m. [Received noon.]

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Dispatches frequently coming in. All going finely. Parke, Wright, and Ord, extending from the Appomattox to Hatcher's Run, have all broken through the enemy's intrenched lines, taking some forts, guns, and prisoners. Sheridan, with his own cavalry, Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west on the enemy's flank, and Wright is already tearing up the South Side Railroad.

A. LINCOLN.
