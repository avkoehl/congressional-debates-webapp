affidavits of at least fifteen witnesses that this man's house and lands have been a home and harbor for bushwhackers for more than a year past. There cannot be any doubt of this. The Government has no indemnity or security to offer to such men, their families, persons, or property. By harboring bushwhackers they foment strife and disorder and become guilty before the fact of the murders and robberies of their neighbors. You will afford no protection to Joshua Hickey and order him to leave this district without delay. Impress upon the minds of all people in your vicinity that they must take an active part in the support of the Government and the maintenance of its supremacy, or the Government will have no protection or security to afford them when the day of their calamity comes. While you make every effort to aid and protect the loyal citizens, you will use equal effort to punish the disloyal enemies of the Government and the general enemies of mankind.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., September 17, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., September 17, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The guerrillas are again concentrating in Clay County. Thrailkill has recrossed the river and with Cy. Gordon has commenced stealing horses and gathering recruits. I shall send portion of Colonel Harding's regiment into that locality at once. Have ordered 200 of his men to procure horses from their homes. I shall take all other troops now at Saint Joseph to Howard and Boone Counties to-morrow.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 17, 1864.

Brigadier General C. B. FISK:

Can't you clear your district in a few days so as to be ready for the draft? If Price don't make a raid soon I might let the Seventh Kansas take a turn over there.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., September 17, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I shall make my district ready for the draft speedily. I hope to give the rebels of Boone and Howard a good start the coming week. Would like the Seventh Kansas at Columbia for ten days. They would do a good work in that time. I go to Macon to-morrow night with 200 men from this post. Shall go through Randolph, Monroe, Boone, and Howard
