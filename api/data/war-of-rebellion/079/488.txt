HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., October 28, 1864-5 p. m.

Brigadier-General GRANGER,

Decatur:

I am glad to hear of the success of the colored regiment. Such a spirited defense will make Hood careful and cautious. I learn through Colonel Lyon from Captain Morton that he has not crossed the Tennessee yet, nor do I believe he can do so if the gun-boats keep up an active patrol above Decatur. You should receive another regiment to-night, and one started from this place to-day at noon. I think you had better stop the last, One hundred and eighty-first Ohio, at Huntsville and strengthen the pickets along the river.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, ALA., October 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch is just received. The re-enforcements and not arrived at the time I made the sortie. It was done by a portion of my old brigade. If my troops were all like these I could easily defy hood. All the re-enforcements thus far, except about 200, are greener that grass. Command is in excellent spirts, and I will make them fight as hard as possible. The rebels expect that Stephen D. Lee, with a division of cavalry, is on the north side of the river. I had heard no report of this. Hood is certainly here with everything he has. Their own estimate is from 35,000 to 50,000. They are certainly resolved to take this place if they can.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., October 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Gun-boat General Thomas has arrived. The rebels themselves admit a large loss in killed and wounded, not only from the shell and canister, but from the musketry from the fort and assaulting parties. one major died in our hands and 1 captain is mortally wounded; 4 other officers have fallen into our hands. These were included in the aggregate sent you to-day. Morgan, commanding Fourteenth U. S. Colored Volunteers, claims to have made 14 prisoners. I have not seen them. Thinks he killed and wounded 40; his own loss about the same. Another regiment just making its appearance as I close this telegram.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
