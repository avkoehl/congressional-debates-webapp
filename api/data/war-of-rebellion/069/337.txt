Ewell's corps yesterday, he says, were in line of battle about 3 or 4 miles southwest from here. He does not know if they are there this morning, but as he came along he saw their pickets about one-fourth of a mile from ours. I make out from his statement that Ewell is on the right of their army, and that Griffin struck cavalry, which they sent infantry to support. General Griffin reports that the enemy are not there now. I have directed him to reconnoiter with a brigade until he finds them.

General Burnside will inform me when his left is in position. In the mean time I am reconnoitering in my front and left.
