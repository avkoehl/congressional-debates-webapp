HEADQUARTERS, Saint Louis, June 4, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,Commanding Department:

General Brown requests that you be advised there are evidences of a concentration of several hundred guerrillas, evidently with the intention of making a raid on some point in Missouri or Kansas. The general does not say where this concentration is taking place, but I presume he must mean somewhere on the western tier of counties of Missouri.
