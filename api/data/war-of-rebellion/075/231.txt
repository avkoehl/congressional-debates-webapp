Colonel R. ROWETT,

Commanding Cavalry Expedition:

COLONEL: Have just received your dispatch of yesterday per courier. If you have driven the enemy across the river, and I have no doubt of it, and congratulate you on your success, you can either take up your old position or return to this place, as I do not feel authorized, under present circumstances, to give your orders for the future. The Ninth Ohio Cavalry are expected to return to Decatur.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MADISON, May 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General SMITH:

I have arrived all right at Madison, ten minutes to 7. Am preparing to follow the enemy at once. They left at 10 o'clock in direction Triana road. They crossed at Gillsport below Triana on flats, Colonel Patterson in command. The Fifth Ohio Cavalry and Fifty-ninth Indiana are harassing their rear. If the gun-boat will only prevent the crossing we will surely get them. The telegraph will be operating in an hour.

Respectfully

J. I. ALEXANDER,

Colonel, Commanding.
