SUGAR LOAF, January 31, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Reports of deserters and from a prisoner captured yesterday, together with the appearance of the fleet and information gained by scouts, induce me to believe the enemy has not withdrawn any of his force except the one regiment which carried the prisoners from Fisher; that is reported to have returned to Grant's army.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 31, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

As Leventhorpe is in the Department of North Carolina, can the general commanding order him to report to me for duty until the recommendation can be heard from? His services are very much wanted to keep the brigade up. It is now commanded by a lieutenant-colonel, who is totally unfit.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

WILMINGTON, January 31, 1865.

Major-General HOKE,

Sugar Loaf:

General Leventrorpe is in this department, but executing orders of the governor, and not now reporting to General Bragg. So he cannot be brought here. Cannot you make some other temporary arrangement? A colonel, for instance, from Kirkland.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
