NEAR CHATTAHOOCHEE, GA., July 10, 1864-6.30 a. m.

(Received 2 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:

The enemy this morning burned his bridges across the Chattahoochee, the railroad bridge included. If General rant has nothing particular for Hunter, Crook, and Averell to do, and if they be in the Kanawha Valley, as is represented, they could be well employed by going to Abingdon, smashing up thinks in that quarter, and then going over into North Carolina.

General THOMAS:

Signal officers report railroad and all other bridges burning. Of course if such be the case, the enemy has gone across, and yet I hear firing of pickets. Report to me the truth as soon as ascertained.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 10, 1864-4.45 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The enemy has left my front and burned the railroad and wagon bridge over the river. I have ordered the skirmishers to feel up and ascertain if they are still on this side. I presume the firing we hear is the pickets exchanging shots across the river.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
