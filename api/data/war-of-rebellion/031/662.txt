the division, in the skirt of wood, where we had no protection [nor could have] from the enemy's artillery. Two batteries were placed in my front, the right one commanded by Captain Davidson, who, I will here state, acted throughout with the greatest judgment, coolness, and bravery.

Friday was taken up by slight skirmish firing and now and then a slight artillery duel.

Saturday morning we were engaged in the same manner. In the afternoon, however, when the enemy advanced on the right, they opened a most tremendous fire of artillery upon the batteries in my front, playing upon them from the front and right from at least four batteries. This fire was most destructive to my men. At about this time a heavy line of skirmishers advanced within range of Captain Davidson's battery and kept up a hot fire upon him. One of their balls at this time killed my aide, Lieutenant [Jacob] Shepperd, while he was very gallantly and coolly trying to rally some men who had broken on our right and were making to the rear. These skirmishers became so annoying that additional companies had to be thrown out, under the efficient Major [Chris. C.] Cole, to drive them back, which he did, and held them in check long after his ammunition had given out. Colonel [John S.] McElroy, with his regiment [the Sixteenth North Carolina], had been placed early in the morning near the railroad cut, and in front of the left battery, which this day consisted of some rifle pieces under Captain [J. W.] Latimer-as brave a soldier as I ever saw-to support it. He was here much exposed, being far in advance of the general line, with his left totally unprotected, but with the ravine of Deep Run to cover the movement of the enemy on his left. After the hear of the action on the right, the enemy advanced a brigade up Deep Run, throwing one regiment somewhat in advance, which so sheltered itself behind the trees as to get near enough to take an officer and 15 men of the Sixteenth prisoners, who were protecting the left flank of their regiment. This left the regiment to be raked by a fire down the railroad track. The colonel drew his regiment back to the ditch near, and here held his ground until General Law sent forward two regiments to his assistance. These three then charged the enemy, driving them from the railroad cut and across the field to within a short distance of their batteries. Owing to a great many of Colonel McElroy's men not having cartridge-boxes, they got out of ammunition, but, getting into the ditch and dividing there, they maintained their ground.

The officers and men of my brigade behaved throughout as well as I would have desired them. I lost as follows:
