General CORSE:

I have just seen Colonel Raum. I think you had better lay down now and take a good long sleep. Give some staff officer general instructions as to scouts, and let him communicate to me direct. General Elliott is on his way to direct Generals Garrard and Kilpatrick when they get in. You have done all a man could, and my judgment in you has been fully vindicated.

Major-General.

ROME, GA., October 11, 1864-4 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I am profoundly grateful for your sympathy and proud of your confidence. Would willingly obey your order, but sleep is out of the question. Nature will assert rights at the proper time I have no doubt. A squadron of cavalry I sent out this morning attacked the picket on the Cave Spring road, about seven miles from here; drove them in until they ran into a line of battle. I just examined a prisoner they brought in from the Second MISSISSIPPI Cavalry. He says the men were told that they were en route for Tennessee and Kentucky. He knows that the main body of Hood's army is across the Coosa, and knows nothing about Blue Mountain, although the troops thought they were going there when they left Dallas. Another squadron of Spencer's I sent down Van Wert road to hunt for Garrard ran into a picket about seven miles down and drove them in, but were compelled to fall back. They learned from citizens near the post from which they drove the pickets that both cavalry and infantry were encamped at Lake Creek last night, but this morning moved WEST toward Cave Spring. Could hear nothing of Garrard. I just sent another down south bank of the Etowah to hunt Garrard.

JNO M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.

General CORSE:

I have just received your telegram. I order you to rest. Don't get your mind so nervous as to fail sleep. General Elliott will be at Rome to direct the cavalry, and that will relieve your mind. A good long sleep, plenty of fresh water to your wound, and you will be worth twice as much to-morrow. I appreciate the intensity of your zeal, and will never forget it.

ROME, October 11, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The cavalry I sent on Alabama road, three companies, attacked and drove in enemy, running into an infantry line of battle about three miles; received a volley, lost a few men, and fell back slowly. The
