Colonel Johnson killed seven; Major Wolfley, with a detachment of the Eighty-third Illinois, is not in yet; reported that he has finished them, which I think is true.

Colonel Malone is to surrender to me on Monday next at Russellville.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of the 4th is received. I had already taken steps for the capture of Jeff. Davis. On the 29th instant I sent Brevet Brigadier-General Osband, with the Third U. S.[colored] Cavalry, to Vicksburg. A copy of my order I inclose, with a copy of my letter to General Dana. I have now scouts out in all directions. On the 25th day of April I received a communication from Brigadier General Marcus J. Wright, C. S. Army, of which I inclose a copy, and of my answer. On the 1st instant I received another letter from General Wright, of which I also inclose a copy, and of my answer.

I am, general, your obedient servant,
