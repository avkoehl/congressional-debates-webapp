Do our iron-clads, or any one of them, regularly lie at night, sufficiently below Fort Johnson to enfilade the approach to Shell Point from the harbor, and to command the month of the creek?

CHARLESTON, S. C., November 8, 1863.

Lieutenant L. M. TUCKER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that on the 28th of October, under instruction from General Rains, I proceeded in company with Captains Bryan and Mickler to obstruct the channel in Skull Creek. In consequence of a lack of oars and the failure of Captain Gray to send them (a telegram having been dispatched from them on the 29th instant), nothing could be done until the 2nd of November, on the night of which we reach Buckingham Ferry. Owing to the near approach of daylight, we were succeeded in putting out 8 wooden-cask torpedoes, within 150 yards of the enemy's pickets. They were placed in position as to render it almost impossible for a vessel to pass without coming in contact. About 2 o'clock of the 3rd instant and explosion was took place, they were unable to ascertain the cause, but think, from the noise and commotion that ensued, a large steamer must come in contact with one of the torpedoes.

Very respectfully, &amp;c., your obedient servant,

JNO. T. ELMORE,

Lieutenant of Engineers, on Special Duty.
