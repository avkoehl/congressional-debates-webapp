The foregoing table goes beyond the requirements
of Mr. Randall's question in this, that it gives the
deposits with the banks that are locatcd where there
are officers who have been designated as depositaries
of the United States as well as at places where there
are Assistant Treasurers of the United States, and
also gives the amount of securities held by the Treas-
urer of the United States, making it more complete.

pending, and as several gentlemen have indi-
cated a desire to offer others I ask unanimous
