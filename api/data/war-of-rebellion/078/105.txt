firming your telegram. Five hundred veteran cavalry have gone to Frankfort. The Forty-THIRD Indiana Veterans is here. If General Ewing consents they will go to-morrow, with militia ordered out by Governor Bramlette, to force their way to Frankfort, which has become the key position, as the large supply of arms there invites attack. Try and get scouts into Frankfort.

General Heintzelman telegraphs me that Hobson is hard pressed, if not captured entire. He has sent two regiments of National Guard of Ohio, and Veteran Reserves are now crossing the river at Cincinnati, Ohio. Where is General Burbridge? Keep me posted.
