HEADQUARTERS,May 4, 1863 - 7.15 p.m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

The general directs a full report of your position, the number of the enemy's forces opposed to you, and your dispositions. He wishes this report as soon as possible, that he may act advisedly.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 4, 1863 - 7.40 p.m.

General HOOKER:

The atmosphere being thick with smoke, it is impossible for the signal officers to see the movements of General Sedgwick or those of the enemy. The artillery firing is very heavy. The musketry fire seems to have sensibly diminished.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BANKS' FORD, VA.,

May 4, 1863 - 9.50 p. m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

General Sedgwick is in direct communication with me, and is about half a mile south of my bridges, in the upper rifle-pits. I informed him in due time of when I expected my bridges to be shelled, but I presume he could not prevent it. Rebel skirmishers are reported to me now as on the left bank, below this, but I do not believe it.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.

F SIGNAL STATION,

May 4, 1863 - 10 p. m.

General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I reported to headquarters what forces were engaged. The enemy attacked Sedgwick. It was his right and center that they were driving.

Captain and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS,May 4, 1863 - 10.20 p. m.

D. BUTTERFIELD,

United States Ford, Va.:

I am now going to General Sedgwick; expect to see him in twenty minutes. Shot and shell flew all around my bridges several times; most fortunately did not hit them. I had only 1 sergeant killed. Have two bridges ready at this moment. A strong infantry fire has just burst out to the right and front, apparently within one-half to three quarters of a mile.

H. W. BENHAM.
