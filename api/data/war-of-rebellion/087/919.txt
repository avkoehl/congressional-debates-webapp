Corps moved toward City Point, and are somewhere this side of City Point; fourth, that he heard his division commander, General Griffin, say that nothing more could be done on our right; fifth, that one more effort will be made to take our lines, and failing in this, a new line of operations will be adopted; sixth, that the attack would be made on the side of the Crater, and that the Second, Fifth, and part of the Eighteenth Corps were, perhaps, ready for the work.

The following casualties are reported: Wise's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 2. Ransom's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 2. Gradie's brigade, wounded, 2. Elliott's brigade, wounded, 2.

Major DUNCAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,December 5, 1864.

MAJOR: I have nothing of interest to report this morning. Owing to the imperfect English spoken by deserter, John Schumacher, I find I was mistaken in his report on yesterday in regard to the disposition of the Yankee forces. Through an interpreter, Brigadier-General Wallace obtained information which shows that the deserter meant to say to me that a part of the Eighteenth Corps was ordered to replace the negroes of the Ninth Corps sent to Butler, and that perhaps that part of the former corps was in rear with the Second and Fifth Corps, and that the Ninth Corps extends from Appomattox to one mile and a half to right of Yellow Tavern, and is there connected with cavalry. I have the honor to forward the name of Captain J. W. Smith, Company I, Twenty-sixth Virginia Regiment, as an officer eminently qualified to fill the position of judge-advocate to a general court martial.

The following casualties are reported: Gracie's brigade, killed, 1; Wise's brigade, wounded, 1.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
