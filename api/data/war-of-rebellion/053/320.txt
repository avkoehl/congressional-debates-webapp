Harmon last night. They say there is nothing going on, or was nothing when they left, about 4 p.m. in the afternoon. One of them says that the pickets above the mouth of South Chickamauga Station; don't cross the creek at all. Will report again in the morning.

General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The rebel lieutenant whom I hoped to see was up the river about Harrison, visiting his posts. We did not see him, but saw 2 privates. They say that the rebel cavalry, except a very small force left to watch the river, has gone upon a reconnaissance, the direction of which or object we could not discover. It left Saturday morning. A little below this point there seems to be, some distance back from the river, a great handling of boards an da thumping noise, made like a calker makes working on boats. Old boatmen say it sounds exactly like a number of calkers at work. This morning there was musketry firing back of Mission Ridge. About the same time there was a great commotion above this point among the enemy's wagons. They were moving about apparently upon a fast trot. Take them altogether they, in the language of Mr. Tolliver, are a "mighty puzzlen sort of people any way."

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

That noise of the calkers still continues. Also we hear what seems to be a saw-mill running. The cars have made more fuss to-day than any day yet. There has been more movement of wagons. We have heard three different bands and more drums than usual. There certainly is some unusual commotion among them.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
