sive evidence th.it thev viere then unsound, and
conducted on unsafe principles What strongei
evidenc can «c have of the delect of this s}stem
than its total failure'
The honorable Senator from Virginia also sa}s
this is a new principle in legislation, that it has not
been recognised in any of the States, except his
own, the past j eai, and there, one dollar of specie
is required to five jf circulation Such a restnc-
tion as that is a rneie mocker}, as no well-admmis-
lered bank can keep jp such a circulation That
this prmciplt has not been re< ognised in the legis-
lation of the States is U ue, yet it is by no means a
new principle It jSas old as the existence of banks,
for originally banks of circulation keep their entire
capital in specie, and their issues were tru" repre-
sentatives of it This puneiple has been gradually
departing from, and, within the list few yeais.it
has been almost entirely disregarded in this conn
try And what is the consequence of tins' I  it
not to deprive the currency of all connection with
specie, and o reduce it to the common standar! of
commeicial paper' Paper which is to be used as
a currency, must have some other found mon to
rest upon than meie security, or the responsibility
of the issuers It is a substitute lor monej, pir-
iforms the functions of money, usurps the place of
coin, and must, in some degree, possess the quill
ties and attributes of specie It must, to sonn ex-
tent, be a true repiesentative oí com, otherwise it
will soon depiecitte and lose its character as
money
Mr N said he beheyed the explosion oí the
banking sjstem the past} ear, was much more to
be attributed toageneial disregaidof tie prine -
pie of preseiving a sound specie basis, than to die
undi e expansion of the is ues In times oí nal
or appaient pospentj, not only individuals, but
coipouilions, forget or disregaid the ordinary prin-
ciples oí prudence and safety It is the instinct
oí banks to make as much money as they can, and
this leads them to invest their entire capital where
it will be proehictive The specie in the vaults of
a bank earns nothing, and all oí them weie di-
minishing the quantity, regarding it as dead cipi-
tal, and it had become a pretty general sentí
ment that this was the true coarse of ci ndtictmg
bmks—to loan all the eapitil, on mortgages u
otbei seiunins, mil to h m ill the deposites and
circuí Hum foi jnpci having a shoit uui, ind to

But Legislatuies must not looie (t the operations
of a single instituí ir, they inu=t look at thes}stem
One bank might exchange i s on a ere lit lor the
credit of individuas, md ciny on a busiutss of
dealing in ciedit without "ny inonov, as it cou! I
sell its mm credit, or the c edit oí others which it
possessed, tor montj when eeessiij leqmrel it
There would, no doubt, bese ne hazard in a four p
of this kind in a sirgle institution óut loul i aU
the banl s in the country no tins'2 Could they all
reduce th°ir business to a mere exel uige of their
own credit for the ere 1 tot others and continue
this without any snec " f turns'! inis would not
be practicable for three month , pnd it was an ^p-
pioximation to tins state ot things that mil do\ n
the system, and pioduced the explosion
Sir, the banking s}stem can nevr rega n the
confidence of the people of uns countiy, until it is
brought brck nearer to its original principles, lion
which it has lecklessl} departed Brille credit
which are c rculated amused as money, mii«t

to a reasonable extent It made th  true reprf-
sentatne and sub titule oí specie, 11 a rea onable
pioporti n, it vill h*\t in a giod degree the attii
bute  of specie, a  s ill i\ ol it and w il eontriet
and expand in the same maimer as specie wouil,
and be governed bv the same law<
But, Mr President, the more immediate question
i now is upon what rule the specie shall be gia-
duated—whethei it ought to bear a cettam propoi-
t on to tue ciicnlahon, or the cnculation anil depo-
sites united This question can be decided by
| refeience to the reason on which the puneiple rests
requiung any specie to be kept by banks That
| reason, as wo have attempted to show, is, m addi
I tion to greatei secuntj, to impart to bank credits,
| which aie used as a substitute foi com, the nttn-
butes of money, and to make them, in 1 ict, the
representatives of specie to some extent The
question, then, s, what are these substitutes'! What
bank credits are u«ed in the place of com? 'Vie
there no other bank credits but bank notes'! If
not, then the specie should bear a proportion to the
cnculauon only Such, howevei, is not the fact
The deposites aie a patt o( the circulation almost
as much as the notes This is especially the case
in all commercial toy is, where most of the busi-
ne 8 is done by a transfei of the bank credits, con
sistit g oí deposites The merchants deposite then
funds in Ihe banks, but they do not do this toi the
purpose of having them In dead there, but foi tin
express purpose ot using i'u m They thaw cheel s
on then deposites, which ruculale "s a bank ciedit,
ami mhen finally piesenled to the bank they aie
not paid m its bills, but the amount ol the cheek is
chuged to the oVawci, and ciedited to the hoi lei,
on the books ol the bulk This is the way m
which a large poition o the business m citusis
transacted And hence it is, that banks of lar"e
capitals and large aggiecale deposites, m great
commeicial towns, h ue but a very small cncula
tion A rule fhuefore, which should require such
banks to hive nit dollai m spec e foi even lrirct
orfourof then circulation woull amount t > nothing
at all, lor the leal circulation ol such banl s, is tin n
I deposites Country banks hivet small imouut ol
di posites, and a 1 nge etieulalnn, civ bink% oi
those in commeicial places, h ivcmu ill mentations
and a large sum on deposite I hese two lotms of
bank ciedit, both perf< rm tin oil (e ol a cuireney,
and are a substitute foi com that being the cas ,
it is difficult to see why the rule requiring specie
should not appi} equally to both?
If you adopt tin ul itnn il me a a nil', you do
great injustice to tie country banks, and lequne
vastly ím íe specie of them than of the city banks,
whose deposites c< nstitute their principal circu-
lation
It is n it very imtcr   1 which  n !e  is  a lopled,

On the Irst of Janaaiy, 1817, the   ( rcjlati n i f
nil the banks 11  «he Un on  w as  one hi r 're t an 1
.  lit'  m I ions, an 1   ->bou   (re  Iran Ircd and  tl irty

anljn ly null ot i of do// r° for to/ if ft the public «as
pemmg them tnfr   st, m addition to their actual capital
I his would amount to mote than fifteen millions of
dollars a year. And yet, with this immense in-
come over and above the use of their capital, the
business has afforded little more than the legal in-
terest to the stockholders How is this1 Why, it
is easily explained The fact that the banks are
allowed to use their credit without limit, m times
ot prosperity, almost invariably causes them
to act rashly and imprudently They make loans
incautiously to doubtful persons, and they loan
largely to speculators, brokers, gamblers m stocks,
and to encourage bold and hazaidoos enterprises.
Whilst the steam is up, they make one or two
large dividends, and then comes the revulsion, and
the heavy losses thrown upon the banks If they
were limited m the use of their credit, they would
act more cautiou'ly, more steadily, and their busi-
ness yvould be more profitable in the end
There is another reason why the banks have not
earned more foi their stockholdfis, which is, that a
Luge shaie of their earnings is squandered in sala-
nes and cxpeuves Does not the fact of the enor-
mous salaries paid by banks to their officers prove,
was there no other evidence of it, that they enjoy
pnvileges which they ought not to possess1! Is
there not something manifestly wrong in the idea
that a mere private corporation should be able to
pay its officers one or two hundied per cent, more
linn is paid to the highest officers of the State
from w hence they derive their charters' The
cashier of a bank íeceives two and throe thousand
dolíais, and the Governor of the State, and the
judges ot the Supreme Court, perhaps one thou-
sand Is there not something wiong in this? Must
it not have a parnicious influence on public senti-
ment! Is it not adding greatly to the power and
influence of these institutions, to allow them such
pn\ lieges as will enable them, combined, to con-
tiol mine p itronage tuan belongs to the State, and
to p iv their ofliceis one or two hundred per cent
m ie than the Slate can afford to pay-2 Is not
this setting up the creature above the creator1
Must it not have a pernicious influence on our
free institution .'!
If diey were more restricted in their issues an 1
earnings, had less piofits, but those more sure and
stable, they would be obliged to cut down the sata-
nes of their officers, and other expenses, and it is
highly desirable that all banks were compelled to do
this
Cut vould the restriction requiring a proportion
of'pecie equal to ore-fourth of then circulation
and deposites, be eppre sive and onerous upon these
banks'? Let us suppose a banu. of two hundrel
thousand dollars capital, with one handred thou-
sand dollars in circulation, and one hundred thou
•and m deposites this bank would be lequired to
ha\c fifty thousand dollars in specie It would
hav e the earnings of its entire capital, and of one
hunt'-ied and fifty thousand dollars of its deposites
an I cnculation, which cost it nothing It would
be receiving interest on a capital of three handred
and fifty thousand dollars, when its aeUal capital
paid in was but two hundred thousand fcuch
would be the immense privileges enjoyed by these
banks, e.ven upon the restrictive principle propesed
to be mcorporaled into the bill B it, sir, the ques-
tion is not one of profit to the banks, but of safety
to tl e publ c It is the first and important duty ot
the Legislature, m establishing a bank, and autho-
i / ng the cnculation of paper money, to take care
that the pullic ihall be safe, and if this cannot be
done consistent with theintcresls of the banks, then
the }stent is bad, and should be abandoned He
belie el, however, there was no difficulty on this
pouii tl e banks will continue to make their pro-
fi s, the only difficulty is to throw around them suf-
iiinnt guards to afford security to the public He
lieped the amendment would be adopted, and that
the i ue spec e prim ip'e would be mcorpoiated into
in b-rkng system, si fai as Congicss has any
j i sjiction over tht subject How far our legis-
lati n wou d be respee'ed by the States, or indu-
ct ce their action, he should not stop to inquire He
dint propose to make model institutions here,
but if called on to establish banl s for the District,
h  wished to establish them on sound principles,
and if this was not attained, no bill could have his
vote.
