Captain LEET:

We had some information here yesterday that troops, supposed to be over a regiment, left Richmond last Saturday evening by the Central railroad, going north. The attention of the men sent by Colonel Sharpe should be carefully drawn to them to ascertain which way these troops have passed from Gordonsville, and their number.
