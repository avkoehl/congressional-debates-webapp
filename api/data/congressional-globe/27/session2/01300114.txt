Yes, they will

Indiana If that gentleman was indeed the accredited organ of
the President of that floor then the President must be held re-
sponsible for what the gentleman said, and then Mr M under-
stood that "we," alias, the President and "the guard," would
not appeal to that House, but would make our appeal to the
people oí the United States for the correctness of our courses.
iSow, was he to understand from this that the President meant
to bea candidate m the ne^t Presidential canvass? If so, let the
honorable gentleman, as his organ md representative here,
make thatdecIaration,then they should know what to rely on.
But to 1 eturn to his subject
Mr M said he was opposed to the policy of the bill Hie re-
pugnance to it was unutturable and invincible Would any
gentleman tell htm that the Government of this Union, repie-
bentmg twenty six great, populous, poweiAil, and independent
^tate j bpmp m want of money foi the puh'ic seivice, and go-
írgmto the market with its bond having twelve years to run, at
an interest of six percent could not obtain it 7— an assertion
which amounted to little phon of a deelaration of bankruptcy
If that were 1 ue then, terrible as it w as the nation ought to know
it This count! y had been with an empty Treasury, on the eve
ofawu wihGieu Britain—a r owei possessing five bundled
ard thiity five «dii s of wai, whilewehavtsixty eight—apower
whose fl ets extending themselves alorg a hue ©fiwn thousand
five hundred n lies, weie able to sndleour entire seaboard, and
might at then pleasure, select any point of attack they deemed
the n os vulnerable—a power who, had -she adnally gone to
wai with u5 wou'd 1 ave found no greater fleet than that to re-
sist her, and who, had the ma e a descent upon the land, wtuld
have etieounteied no army but the fiee and hardy yeomanry of
the lain' An experiment indeed, «he would never again make,
but would wisely confine herseli to the ocean There would
have been thp field of combat, fui
'Típi match was on the mountain wave,
Her home was on tl e deep "
Then we must have fought, cost what it might Ard did he
understand genvlen en a^ averting that we could not, even 10
that emeigenev have raised twelve millions of dollars on the
bond of this Government/ So help him Heaven, he did not be-
lieve a woid of it So far was it fiom being true, timtjhadthe
necessity existed flip Government could have got from this
great people a hundicd or two hundred millions on its simple
 cr p,
But they were toid there was a necessity for this emission of
Treasury notes Mr M had denied it in committee, and he de-
li ed it here If the money must be had, he preferred a loan
He abhorred the whole Treasuiy note system not on constitu-
tional grounds, for he bad not examined the constitutional
questtor, but he abhorred it on every account, on national
grounds and, also he would frankly avow it on party grounds.
How did wc *. eiuil The Bark bill had been vetoed, the Bank-
niptliw was go e, he supposed the Distrih Hion law was in
Ii tie bettei coodi ion the loan had fai'ed, and now they were
to be thrown on the Tieasury note system Heaven and earth >
