Kennerly, of Company A, First and Fourth Missouri Infantry, and 4 men were killed and 3 wounded by two shells; 1 wounded from Second and Sixth, and 2 killed and 2 wounded from Third and Fifth. Captain S. A. Kennerly was a most fearless, cheerful, and determined officer, and on May 16, 1863, at battle of Baker's Creek, received a most severe wound, and was left on the field believed to be dead, from the effects of which he had never fully recovered; and notwithstanding this he had been on duty during the past arduous campaign.

September 6 the enemy had withdrawn from our front, and as soon as it was known I at once asked permission of Major-General French to follow up the enemy, which was granted, and about 8 a. m. I moved on the road leading to Jonesborough, along the railroad, with my brigade; passed Cheatham's division, commanded by Brigadier-General Gist, just outside of our works, and continued to advance and engage the enemy's skirmishers some distance south of Jonesborough'; drove them back steadily to a strong line of skirmish works just south of Jonesborough, and with two companies, commanded, respectively, by Lieutenants Strong and Mahan, from First and Third Cavalry, two companies from Second Sixth Infantry, commanded, respectively, by Captain Alford and Hickey, and one company from Third and Fifth Infantry, commanded by Captain P. Canniff, all commanded by Captain Canniff, a fearless and skillful officer, charged these works, drove the enemy from them, capturing several prisoners after a very spirited engagement, and pursued them to their main line of works just north of Jonesborough, where the enemy were found in very large force behind their old line of works occupied by them August 31.

In this skirmish Lieutenants Benjamin F. Welch. Company G., Second and Sixth; A. J. Strong, Company B, First and Third Regiment, in the fearless discharge of duty, were wounded, the latter very severely; 1 sergeant and 4 men from Second and Sixth and 2 men from First and Third were wounded.

In this little engagement both officers and men bore themselves with conspicuous gallantry, and drove at least three times their own number from strong skirmish works. A detailed report of this day's operations has been heretofore made.*

Late in the afternoon we returned to our old position, meeting and passing Gist's command about one mile and a half south of Jonesborough. Hereto attached, marked A, and made a part of this report, is the list# of killed, wounded, and missing of my brigade, which shows a loss of 5 officers and 12 men killed, 9 officers and 79 men wounded and 6 men missing.

In the operations of the army under General Hood the officers and men of my brigade have alike performed immense labor, working most industriously by day and night; have endured unaccustomed hardships and fatigues; have been constantly exposed to the fire of the enemy and the inclemencies of the weather; and amid all these have constantly borne themselves with the most conspicuous gallantry and fearlessness, exhibited the most soldierly bearing and commendable fortitude, and have manifested a most praiseworthy,
