FORT KEARNY, May 24, 1865.

(Received 1. 25 a. m. 25th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Indications are that Indians, broken up in small forces, intend attacking whole stage line from bridge, Missouri River. May I advise that Colonel R. R. Livingston, of First Nebraska Veteran Cavalry, now commanding this sub-district, who is to be mustered out by consolidation, should be retained. General Connor and others with myself regard his experience as invaluable in the emergency now pending.

Brigadier-General CONNOR,

Fort Kearny:

Five hundred horses leave here the 26th for Kearny. Have an escort of some kind for them at the Little Blue, at such point as you may designate. How are matters this side of Kearny? A regiment of cavalry is on the way here, which will be pushed right out to the Blue for you.

Brigadier-General SIBLEY,

Saint Paul:

Reports about Fort Rice untrue. General Sully reports to me that runners have come in the that post to notify him that 3,000 lodges of Yanktonnais and other Sioux are on the way there to see him and make peace. Sully has gone up, and, if necessary, will march against Devil's Lake with large cavalry force. His orders for expedition to Black Hills I have countermanded.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
