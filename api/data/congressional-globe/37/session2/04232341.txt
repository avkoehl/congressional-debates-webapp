by Rev. Dr. Suxderlaxd, Chaplain of the Senate.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
CONFLICT OF JURISDICTION.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I rise to what T consider
to be a privileged question. I will send it to the
Clerk's desk and let him read it.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state his
privileged question.
Mr/WIOKLIFFE. I have reduced it to writ-
inland I ask the Cleik to read it.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks the gen-
tleman should Estate the nature of the question he
proposes to present. Otherwise a gentleman could
have anything read under the plea that it was a
privileged question.
Mr. WICIvLFFFE. The nature of it is this:
there is now pending m this District a most dan-
gerous and threatening conflict, which may lead
to bloodshed. It is nothing less than a conflict of
jurisdiction between military power and the ju-
dicial power. The military power, under the au-
thority of the so-called military aovuinor of this
District, has seized the jail of this District.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that ho
does not see how that can constitute a question of
privilege.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. If the privileges of this
country are not a question of piivilege, i should
like to know what is.
TheS?EAKER. The Chair does not think
the gentleman presents a question of piivilege.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. If we are to sit here and
allow this conflict to go on, and cannot bring the
matter before the House, 1 think it is time that it
was understood.
The SPEAKER. It is nothing relating to the
privileges of the House or to the privileges of any
member, and therefore it is not a question of priv-
ilege.
CONFISCATION.
The House then proceeded to the special order,
being House bill No. 471, to confiscate the prop-

Government and lawful authority of the United States;
and also to inform the Senate if anv steps have been taken
to make this statute effective, and to insure its due execu-
tion by our advancing annies for the benefit of slaves who
have been so employed.

made, the resolution will lie over,
PROSECUTION OF THE WAR.
Mr. SUMNER. I offer another resolution. I
shall not ask its immediate consideration, but
desire to have it read for information.
