Major H. B. McClellan, assistant adjutant-general, was ever at my side night and day, and I am greatly indebted to him for the clearness with which orders and dispatches were transmitted.

Major A. R. Venable, assistant adjutant and inspector general, deserves special mention for his soldierly bearing and efficient conduct throughout, but particularly for his conduct in evading the enemy near Auburn, and reaching the commanding general with important dispatches on the night of the 13th.

Major Heros von Borcke was, I regret to state, absent, disabled by his wounds received at Middleburg in June.

Medical Director Fontaine and Captain Blackford (Engineers), and the rest of my staff, behaved with their usual efficiency.

The report of the provost-marshal (Ryals) is appended, showing the approximate number of the enemy captured during this movement, the arms, horses, and equipments having been appropriated in most cases by the various regiments making the captured.

The special cases of personal daring will be included in the detailed reports of subordinate commanders, but I deem it proper to mention here the daring heroism of Private Bushrod C. Washington, Twelfth Virginia Cavalry, not only in combat, but in his extraordinary escape from his captors at Rappahannock bridge on the night of October 11.

The 6 privates who volunteered to pass through the enemy's column were: Robert W. Goode, Company ---, First Virginia Cavalry; Sergts. Ashton Chichester and Shurley, McGregor's battery, horse artillery; Privates Crockett Eddins and Richard Baylor, Company B, Twelfth Virginia Cavalry.

The commander of the enemy's cavalry reported 3,700 of his cavalry put hors de combat during this movement. God having granted our cavalry signal success at every point, and chastised a vain-glorious people, to Him, therefore, belong the honor and the glory.

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.

Chief of Staff, Army of Northern Virginia.
