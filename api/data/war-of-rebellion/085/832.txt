HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER,Fort Smith, Ark., October 13, 1864 - 10.30 a. m.

Colonel S. H. WATTLES,

Commanding Indian Brigade, Fort Gibson, C. N.:

SIR: Your dispatch of the 10th, and which left Gibson at 7 a. m. of the 11th instant, reached here at 9 o'clock this morning, having been fifty hours on the way. My scouts returned night before last. I am now satisfied Cooper did not move this way. I presume we can supply you with ammunition, but you do not state the kind you want. I would advise you to make your requisition on Fort Scott, so that it can come through with the next train, and, in the meantime, if you want some, you can get it by sending your requisition here. Captain Durbin will send by this messenger instructions to Lieutenant Robb to purchase all the horses he can find serviceable. I want you to keep your scouts as well mounted as you can. Also mount the dismounted cavalry as far as possible. Your quartermaster and commissary should purchase and seize all the corn there is to be had; not, however, distressing families. I shall send an order by this messenger for the additional regiment escorting the train this way to return to Gibson. I would advise that you organize all the Indians and refugees into companies as far as practicable. Please forward accompanying dispatches* to Fort Scott. Keep your scouts out constantly in direction of the enemy. I will do the same.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR,

Fort Scott, Kans.:

SIR: Your dispatch of the 6th instant reached me this morning. I have nothing of special interest to communicate. General Steele sent a cavalry force which came through and communicated with me. The main force of the enemy under Cooper and Gano is now near Johnson's Station, south of the canadian. I do not think is advisable for the train to start yet. I send you the orders detailing certain parties to recruit for the Fourteenth, as you requested. I see statements in the Fort Scott Monitor to the effect that we are all packed up here ready for evacuation. I wish you would correct this. The messenger who carried such a report lied outright. I have not and shall not contemplate such a step. The only thing I fear is that Price, if driven out of Missouri without his army being broken up, will return this way and unite with Cooper; then we might be in peril. I trust by all means of Price escapes from Missouri he will be followed by the requisite force to the Arkansas River, so as to relieve me if he should attack this place.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
