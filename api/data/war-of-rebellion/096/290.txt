Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I learn unofficially that a soldier deserted to the enemy across the river on the ice at daylight this morning, belonging to First Connecticut Artillery. He probably carried information of our placing heavy gun in McGilvery last night. Much of the enemy's firing this morning was directed at that fort.
