SOUTHERN MARYLAND IIAILROAD.
Mr. LEWIS. I desire permission at this
time to present a memorial.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
will receive it.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. President, some time ago
the honorable Senator from New York whose
seat is nearest me [Mr. Coxkt.ixg] presented
to the Senate a remonstrance of some citizens
of Washington against the passage of measures
pending before Congress in relation to grant-
ing aid to certain contemplated railroads, and
asked that the remonstrance be made to bear
specially against Senate bill No. 597, which
I had reported from the Committee on the
District of Columbia on the 15th of March
last, with an amendment, made by the honor-
able chairman of that committee. The Sen-
ator from New York, on presenting the remon-
strance, remarked to the Senate that the bill
ought not to pass. â€¢ Such, sir, was not the
opinion of the committee when I was instructed
to report the bill, nor do I believe it to be the
opinion of the Senate to-day. After a full in-
vestigation I have arrived at the conclusion
that this road is of great importance to the city
of Washington and ought to pass. I now beg
leave to present a memorial in response to
that remonstrance, and ask that it be reported
to the Senate by the Secretary, and then be
made to bear specially in favor of the passage
of the Southern Maryland railroad bill. The
memorial, as will be seen, is signed by many of
the most prominent and influential citizens of
Washington ; many of them are men of charac-
ter and wealth. I hope the Senate will indulge
me so far as to take up and pass this measure
before the close of the morning hour.
The Secretary read as follows:
Washington, IX C., June\, 1S70.
To the Senate and
House of Representatives now assembled:
The undersigned, citizens of Washington, District
of Columbia, have been informed that certain re-
monstrances lia.vc been presented to Congress against
the passage of bills belore the Senate and House of
representatives giving authority to the people of
this city, through their municipal government, to
grant aid to certain railway companies. The ques-
tion presented, against which remonstrance is made,
is to authorizo the people, by a vote of two to one, at
the option of the city authorities to grant such aid.
This proposition leaves it in the power of one third
of the legal voters, at any election touching the
matter, to defeat the appropriation of such aid.
The undersigned cannot overlook the great fact in
modern or recent commercial life that centers of
business everywhere in this country depend almost
exclusively upon rail facilities of transportation.
jNoristhis city any exception to the rule. The na-
tional capital has drawn to it a certain class of peo-
ple specially engaged in the service of the Govern-
ment. Beyond this source of strength there is little,
indeed, to rely upon for progress in the future. Gov-
ernment employment issnuple subsistence. There
is nothing in it of tha t expansive enterprise, that
genius of invention and energy, which makes great
cities. It is a-sort of factory, with many employes
and tew superintendents.
The undersigned, regarding the present position
of the city in this light, are ot opinion, nevertheless,
that by a judicious expenditure of means in building
railways to the sea-board and to the interior, open-
ing channels of trade, enlarging production and mar-
kets, Washington L.m be made a commeicial and
business mart, as well as a, political capital.
The present debt of the city is said to be large. The
difficulty, it is believed, consists not so much in the
extent of the debt as ill the fact that this city itself
is a mere political capital. Three times the amount
! now due by the city would be less burdensome if wo
| could command rail transit in the diiections pro-
| posed by the bills before Congress.
: We appeal confidently to the observation of every
Senator and liepresentative in Congress that rail-
ways and growing cities are one and the same thing.
I Washington is no exception to this rule.
J The undersigned are convinced that the bonds of
the city will always remain at large discount in the
I market until rail facilities are provided and thepeo-
1 pic can be made to feel that they have other reliance
! than upon toe dispensation of public patronage.
With railways to the interior, which shall bring
j Washington into diiect communication with the
great coal basin of Maryland and Virginia, and with I
the mines of Pennsylvania, now under woik to !
Frederick, Maryland, and to the ripen waters of the '
| Atlantic at Point Lookout, the undersigned believe !
I the bonds of the city to three times their present j
' extent would command rates far above what they i
, are now sold for in market.
j' The undersigned, therefore, respectfully insist that
it is of vital interest to this city that said railways
should be constructed at an early day; and they are
' confident that the present guarded bills before Con-
gress, authorizing the people to vote upon thequea-
tion of aid, should pass.
| [The petition is signed by two hundred and
i forty-five citizens, including S. J. Bowen, 'h.
; Richards, C. Wendell, C. Willard, F. Tenney
! & Co., A. R. Potts, Marshall Brown, P. II.
1 Donegan, John S. Crocker, and other influ-
ential citizens of the District of Columbia.]
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Virginia asks unanimous consent to
call up at this time the bill referred to by him.
Is there objection?
Mr. CONKLING. I must object.
Mr. LEWIS. I move to pass over the pend-
ing order and take up that bill.
Mr. ABBOTT. I wish to introduce a bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The reg-
ular business of the morning hour at this time
is the introduction of bills and joint resolu-
tions, and that business must be proceeded
with, unless it be displaced by unanimous
consent.
Mr. CONKLING. Let us go on regularly.
