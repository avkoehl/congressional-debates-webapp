A confi Itíftiial communication fiom the Presiden tí Not at all'
No communication of any kind from him, but from a public
0f]jee—ii, m the General Post Office The letters in question
came from the Post Office, and bore the bloody marks of that
deportment—the red ink eudoisemems—which pointed to their
contents, and cfaimea the attention of the officers to them The
Postmaster General had correctly described them in his letter,
read yesterday, as being archives of the department—as being
on file lit the department Archives are public papers What
is filed in a public office is a public paper Our offices were pub
lie, what was in them was public, they were i ot Bastilles or
inquisitions, there was no hiding either men or papers m them
The letters in question cannot bear the light, they contain
lalsehoods against himself and one of his constituents, and they
solicit the proscription against a good officer, and the appoint
mem. of a political partisan, for base party purposes But the
fault was not m publishing them, but in writing them,
and filing them m a public office, and making them
archives of the Government This was the fault, and
the President should hare been dissatisfied with the writers
for writing such letters, or with himself for films them
in a public office, to influence the official action of the Govern
ment, and not be dissatisfied with him for publishing what was
a public document He called upon Mr Merrick to show the
paper with the (fficial red ink endorsement, and abstracts of
their contents on the back of the letters, anJ which showed
them, to be what the Postmaster called them— archives of the
department/ and consequently public documents which he
had a right to use, and should use They had not come from
the President, they came from a public depai tment, bearing the
marks of the department, and he should treat them as public
documents, and notas private letters. Doubtless they were in
tended to be private doubtless the waters never expected to see
them in public doubtless they did not expect them to be placed
on file in a public office but this has been done, and they have
come to light, and they contain matter which concerns both the
Government and individuals—matter which was false and in*
3urious to individuals, and aviolauon of the President's inau-
gural, and Mr Webster's circular against interference m elec
tions. The writing of the letters was criminal, the crime is
found out, and the blame must fall on the act, and not on the de-
tection.
Mr B continuedhisremarksonscvcial points until the hour
of one, when he gave way to the appropriation bill, promising
to take a wider view of the subject the next day to view it un«
<£er different aspects, and especially under the aspect of secrecy,
which the Postmaster General had claimed for his department
He denied that our public offices could be made depositories
of secrets—secrets which were to blacken the characters of cm
zens, and aftei wards to furnish matter for the scandalous chron
ides He said this pretension was copied irom the Bank of the
United States, wheie black ehaiacters were filed against lead
ing Democrats,designated by numbers—one, uo, three, four,
Ac , with keys to their names, as stale pnsoneia were desig
listed in Europe fíe woul 1 show a sample of this to morrow
He said that under this Administration he had had access to the
earns kind of letters in the Wai office, with the approbation of
Mr Bell He had there found similar letters (rom the same

THC GENERAI APPROPRIATION BILL
On motion of Mi EVANS, the Senate proceeded to the con-
sideration (as in committee of the whole) of the bill making
appropriations foe the civil and diplomatic expanses of the
Government for the year 1842—thp piopo<*mon pending being
the motion of Mr Benton to stuke from the clou eof the bill
appropriating «93,335 85, to supply the deficiency in the con
tirtgent fund of the2oth Congrela, the word 'booke^'sothatno
part of this sum, which is intended to pay balances due for
printing, lithographing, binding and hooka shall op applied to
the payment Tor the books, Which c&st $53,000, ordered by the
Ifouse of Representatives on, a simple resolution at the last
hour of theiCth Congress   f
Mr BENTON said ti e proposition, he believed, was to strike
out the word ' books > from a paragraph containing many
items, which items weie stated to be contingent expenses ofthe
House of Repiesenutives He had several objections aeamst
continuing lhi=> item m the bill ore of which was that it did not,
either directly or indirectly, come within the scope and mean
mg oí contuigentcxpenses, nor did it neceb^auly form a part of
the incident i\ expend oí the JI >use The greatest abuses in
the expenditure would be fonda m these grants for incidental
expense*, and he must bs a eovice in legislation indeed who
does not see that, without &*r*1ung at this enormous source of
extravagance, he who stands' up as the advocate of retrench
merit and economy m the ¿public expendnuies advances the
cause but feebly Nay, asarmembei of twenty two years'stand
ing, he wful 1 «ay to s ich advocate of economy, that if he
would fir>d out abuse5' he must elimine such items as
these Iip mu1" I ok n the s^t lenient of accounts, an 1

title of incidental expense**, argued a course of legislation, to
say the lea«t of it, absurd and mmhcious The i em now un-
der copsideration was placed under a fa se head It was no
more an incidental expense ofthe Hou^e of R°p e&erjtatives,
than the purchase of the private libiary of an individual merr -
foer It was attempted at the last moment of the last Congress
So pass a resolution by which a quantity of books should he de 
CONfiRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Hvered to each member, to the amount of about five hundred
dollars to each Jt was an abuse as outrageous m the principle,
although it wasattempted to be justified on the supposition that
the books were to be used for public purposes aa it was
outrageous as to the manner in which it was attempt
ed to be accomplished He (Mr BfiNTOfi) had upwards
of twenty years' expenenee in regard to these matters, and even
before he had served in Congre&s, he had paid some attention to
the manner in which the accounts with public contractors, and
other accounts, were admitted and passed, and he was aware
of instances where a sing'e account contained questionable
items to the extent of upwards of $90 000 Large sums of
money out ofthe contingent fund were continually being grant
ed, without a shadow of legal authority for its expenditure In
the case of the resolution granting the $500 worth of books to
each it was actually voted upon after the session had virtually
closed, and the powers of members had ceased It was, in
fact, giving to themselves $500 worth of books at the instant
when their public lives terminated If it had been by a btíl,
there would have been an opportunity foi contesting the propo
sition, but it was a i esolution, hastily forced upon the Senate, as
theie was not a sufficientcontiugent fund at the time to cover the
amou nt And where did they find it now"1 In the appropriation
bill—a bill which ought to be passed early m the session, and
which would have so parsed, were it not Sor a practice, which
had giown up under this Administration, of putting in disputa
blearticles He was well aware of the injury írflicted upon
those who depended fortheirdaily bread upon the Government,
by these dtlays They were injurious to the wh >le public
business of the countiy Here was a question on which the
sense of the Senate had been expressed again and again, and
it was declared to be a contingent expense ofthe lToj3e of
Representatives, when it was not of that charactei at all He
asked the yeas and nays upon the motion
The yeas and nays were ordered, and
Mr FVANS expressed a strong desire that thp hill would be
passed to day. He perceived, by the published proceedings of
the other end of the Capitol, the House intended to adjourn on
Thursday till Monday, and, as he understood, immediately on
meeting, and it was evident that, unless the bill was parsed
to day, and sent to the House to morrow, it will be delayed till
next week, to the great inconvenience and injury of the public
service
With regard to the appropriation under discussion, he con
tended that it had been always the practice of both branches of
Congress to order books to be distributed, and appropuate for
their payment out of the contingent fund Such hid long been
the usa^e, and he saw no impropriety in it The contingent
fund Is provided for the use of Congress a committee m each
House having complete control over n m respect to the expen
diture The geneial principle and general piactice have been,
that any expense shall be paid out of that fund which each
House by its own action oiders to be paid
What is the lactí That the House ordered a certain number
of books to be disposed of, thty were so disposed of, and now
the persons who furnished them are to be paid Herefeired
to the action of the Senate by its own resolution heretofore, in
relation to the distribution of the land laws, p tvt of which were
deposed of lately to the States, by a i esolution of the Senate
It was true, the distribution complained of was made in the
House on the last day oí the session The Senatot from New
York was mistaken ai to that resolution having been offered
by the member Aom New York, [Mr Mitchell] whosere^o u
Hon was net adopted
It was hn I Mr Evans s] resolution which had been adopted
by ainajoniy of two Urn is, and he was sUdof it, for he be
lieved it was all i tght He was not a beneficiary ofth it reoolu
Uon, for he had himself received his looks longbefoie He
denied that the books were gener illy to be found in the stores
at fifty cents apiece, or that they were purchased over and ovei
again, and resold to Congress He believed none ever distrib
uted were sold, unless by the administrators of deceased
members of Congress He dwelt lor some time on the
value and advantage of such works to membeisof Congress,
and as^eited that such valuable books nevei would have
been punted unless encouraged by Congiess lie contended
(hat such works could not be published unless by thepationaee
of the Government, that they could not be rroie equally
diffused ovei the whole Union than thrsugh successive mem
hers of Congress , and that in this w<ty the íesult was beneficial
to the whole community— those who have thus received them
holding them in tru t foi the use of their constituents But if
they were to conveu them into money, to fill their own pock
ets, he would look upon it as a great abuse He had nevei
learned however, that such was the fact
Mr ALLEN said he regretted to hear the gentleman who had
charge of this bill adopt the tone he had with regard to tins
amendment The bill was a general appropriation bill, and
contained he believed, appropriations of some eight or ten mil
lions ofdollaisof the money derived from the people by means
of taxation It was,, in fact, a matter of taxation which they
had to consider, taxation and expenditure being so intimately
blended There was but one faculty of the Government em-
ployed m both, and it was one which operated most extensively
upon the interests of the people, and which deeply affected
their welfato Notwithstanding that they had spent in the Sen
ate some three or four months m discussing questions which
had no particular application to the affairs ofthe country, now,
at the end of five months, the appropriation bill- one of the
most impoitant bills that could engage their attention -was
brought forward and they were tola that it must be passed
without a moment's time being allowed to examine its details
although, by a rule ot the House, u was made obligatory upon
that bo iy, in Committee of the Whole on the s ate of the Union
wiiei e liberty of speech may be more fully exercised than under
the organization of the House itself U was the money opera
tion or mow v (acuity of the Government which most deeply af
feels the people, and therefore any rreisi le having for its ob
¡ec the exercise of that faculty either by way of taxation or
appioi nation, shiuld be most del b lately discussed
It was contended that this item foi bocks was one of the con
t ngent expen&es of tie House of Ri prestntativej He dene I
m the fi st place, tha it wa"a contingent expense at all arc! in
the next place, that it w is ncuuei fur the House It wa= 'no
such thing It depended upon uothirg bat the teiipoiary v-ili of
the House, and was m nowise connected with the oidinary busi
nessof Govetnmenr But, agarr the books Or motherworts

the members of the House Were the books the rrnperty of
the House? They weie not And with what propriety couid
they become tho property of a part of the members, without
—_-™«
becoming thepropeity of the whole"* It was not, thereforeran
appropriation for the House, but for a given number of xadivi*
dualssitting as members ofthe House Stationery furnished for
the use of the House, was the property ofthe House, and be
cause it was the propeuy of the fI urce, each member feels
himself entitled to appropriate a portion of it to his own mdivid
ual use, but with regard to these books, they were to become
the pioperty of a certain numberof the members, and with
them the other members have nothing to do It could not, then,
be said to be an appropriation for the House at all, they would
b°come the property oi members, not by virtue of their official
capaeity, hut by a resolution making them individual property
i he Senate some yeais ago had made a stand against the sys
tern of members augmenting the r salaries, by voting them*
selves books, which books they, afterwards, as suited their
pleasure, conver ednto money, and thus violated the Constitu
tío i
Could the House of Representatives, or this House either,
jta^s a resolution to augment the pay of its membeis to $9 00
per day, eveiy body would see at once that it was an appropn
atton of money And yet gentlemen suppose they can accom-
plish the same object, by means of resolutions of either House,
to be passed for the benefit of a i art of the member  of that
House He would not confine himself to the House of Repre
senlauves in cousi 'enng the question cf power inherent in one
co ordinate branch of the Government to make appropriations
of this kind, he would refer to a similar proceeding on the
part of the benate, which took place m 1839 A proposition
was made to distribute not the public documents of the Gov
ernment, but a wor* published by oider of Congress, relating
to the formation of the Government—the Madison Papers, as
they were called When thooe papers, which had been printed
at the expense of the Government, were published, and were
selling at nine and ten dollars a copy, a resolution was in
troducedinto this body, providing for the distribution of these
books—not among the States—not to the public libraries, or
to the various depaitments ofthe Government—-but to the in-
dividuals who occupied tnese seats, and the resolution passed—
and that, too, after the seats of those who voted had become,
by the Constitution, vacant, after the House of Representatives
had adjourned sine die, and after Congress had ceased
to exist lhe House of Representatives had adjourn-
ed two hours previously, and the Senate was aware
of that fact, an 1 yet, without even having a quorum
present, they passed a resolution distributing these books,—
an act which exceeded any depai ture which the House of Rep
resentatives could make fiom its constitutional privileges He,
(Mr Allen) remembered full well the proceedings of that night,
he remembered that when the resolution was brought in, there
were not ñve membtrs who were paying attention to what was
going forward The Senate had previously expressed its hostil
uy to such a proceeding, a large majority were averse to it, and
were well known to be so, yet, through their inattention, (owing
to the lateness ofthe hour,) the resolution was carried through
its third reading, and passed According to the entry upon the
journal ofthe Senate, upon motion of Mr Tallmadge u was
read a third time, and passtd by unanimous consent He
(Mr Allen) well remen bered that he rose in his place and ob
jected to the passage of the resolution, or to any action being
had upon itv because the House of Representatives had adjourn
ed and Congress had expired The Senator from Missouri
[Mi BsntonI and himself had kept Tip the debate for the pur
pose of preventing itb passage At last the Senator from Missouri
moved an adjournment, and, upon taking the yeas and nays, it
was found that there weie not eighteen Senators present The
Senator from Missouri also, at his (Mt A 's) suggestion, re*
qune 1 that the hour should beenteied upon the journal, and it
was accordingly dune These facL^were apparent to every one
who[would take the trouble of exam ning the proceedings of the
Senate asrecorded upon its journal
