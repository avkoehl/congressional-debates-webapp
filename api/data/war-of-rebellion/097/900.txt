SIR: I have the honor to report that I am paroling men of the rebel Army of Northern Virginia who surrender to our forces and report here without paroles, giving them a certificate of the that they are paroled for their protection. This certificate gives them permission to go to their homes undisturbed. All thus far are Virginians. I take from them their parole of honor not to take up arms (until duly excharched) against the authority of the United States Government. A list of names, &amp;c., I transmit to the Adjutant-General of the Army and to department headquarters. I order these men so paroled to report to the provost-marshal-general, Defenses South of Potomac. If this course is not correct please inform me and give me instructions.
