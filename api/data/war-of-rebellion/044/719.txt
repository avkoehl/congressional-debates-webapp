The major-general commanding congratulates the cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia upon the victory of Fleetwood, achieved, under Providence, by the prowess of their arms on the 9th, instant.

You confronted with cavalry and horse artillery alone this force, held the infantry in check, routed the cavalry and artillery, capturing three pieces of the latter without losing a gun, and added six flags to the trophies of the nation, besides inflicting a loss in killed, wounded, and missing at least double our own, causing the entire force to retire beyond the Rappahannock. Nothing but the enemy's infantry,
