HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, July 4, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

Aide-de-Camp to General Grant, City Point:

Gillmore, in order to get Michie on his staff, has had him commissioned a captain and aide-de-camp. If Michie accepts this, can Gillmore take him away from here, or can Michie accept it and be still kept here on engineering duty in spite of Gillmore? Please get all information and answer.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, July 4, 1864.

General WEITZEL,General Butler's Headquarters:

When the President relieves Gillmore from command of Tenth Corps or Confirms the relief his staff reverts to their original positions. By orders from here, Gillmore is entitled to take Michie with him as one od his personal staff. That order, so far as relates to Michie, might be rescinded on Butler's application, but such a step might cause Gillmore to recommend that Michie be mustered out as captain, a thing that would probably not be done for some time, judging rom other cases, if Gillmore had Michie with him in another command.
