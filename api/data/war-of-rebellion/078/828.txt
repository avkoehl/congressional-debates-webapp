one attempting to pass your lines in contravention of these instructions or with cotton in violation of the positive laws of the Confederate States, you will promptly cause their arrest and closely confine them until they can be brought to trial, burning the cotton attempting to be passed out, and turning the property used in its transportation over to the nearest C. S. marshal or deputy marshal. In the event of the enemy advancing upon your lines you are expected to fight and vigorously contest his advance. Should you be compelled to retreat or fall back, you will burn all cotton that may be within your reach and liable to fall into his possession.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. F. BULLOCK, JR.,

nt-General.
