1     The ques ion then rerumng on the adoption of
the resolution,
|     Mr J  a   ADAMS called for the yeaa and
nays, which were ordered.
Mr L"i TLE offered an amendment, but it was
I   not ronsioe ed in order.
Mi HUBBARD piooosed to amend the reso-
lution by striking out the words "Committee on
Military J)ffa rs, "and inserting " ft select committee,
to consist i J one membei fiam each S'ate "
Mi   H   remarked mat he h id voted against the
i motion to lay the resolution offered by the gentle
man fiom Kentucky on the tiule, and  he  had
I done so from a settled com ictioii that the time I ad
arrived \<hen s raie inquiry into the s flairs of this
instuutmn ought to be made.    It v/ai perfectly
iramfest, fion  what had transpired heretofore,
and fiom passing events, tnat there was an oppo-
sition, and an increasing opposition, to theacademy
at V/eist Point, the reasons why,  be could  not
di'tinciiy tell, but su"h he believed to be the fact,
whether it arises from the tnfnner of admirnstei   ,
ing the affnrs of the ms'itttio", or whether from ,
the creation of the institution itself, he was unable |
to say
F,om what had come to his knowledge, he I
bthcied tnat the Legi-Iatuics of two at least of I
t ic States uf this Un on have e ^pre^sly instructed j
t ¡e . íespec ive delegations in C >i gress to oppose

The House refused, on motion of Mr POLK,
to suspend the rule, and proceeded to the consid-
eration of the Houseapniopuation bill—ayes 102,

REMOVAL OP THE DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
motion to refer the report of the Secretai y of the
Treasury on the deposites to the Comtm tee of
Ways and Means—the question being on the
amendment submitted by Mr Jones, asan amend-
ment to lhatpievtously submitted by Mr. McDuf-
fid, viz to add to the motion foi iererence the
following instructions to that committee: "In-
' q lire into the expediency of depositing the rev-
' enue heieafter co'leeteil n the State banks in the
' different States, where the same is collected, in.
'pioportion to their respective capita's paid in,
'and to prescube the terms on which the same
' shall be deposited, and to leport by bill or other-
' wise "
Mr ARCHER, of Virginia, addressed the
Cna'i Tne qie&tion, he said, had been so long
debated that it was almost impossible to present
it m any new hghl He should endeavor to com
p ess the remarks which he had to offer m rela-
tion to it, for m-rny reasons admonished lum to
be brief He owed it to the peculiar position in
whic i the S a'e which he m part represented
stood to this fjiiestion, and he ov/ed it to himself
to express hi3 views in regard to it The gentle-
man from Georg.a [Mi Joves] the other day
made an allusion to himself, by remaikmg that
he [Mr Jovls] had, during his whole political
life, been an advocate of the doctrine of strict con-
stan tío i of th C institution My principles ^aid
i\lr A ) require tnat I "hould advocate the strict
construction ot the constitutional powers of the
executive as well as c f the legislative branch of
Government Sir, what was this questioti of the
deposites when we first took it up? it was a
question of construction of a statute by a judicial
officer What is the question now ' Not only in
conversation, and in the public press, but in our
debates, it has become a question whether the
Ban't of the United Sta'es shall be íechaitered.
Aie gentlemei who have made this new issue
aware of what admissions they make by it ? They
told us that the question of the rechaiter of the
bank had been decided by the people How, then,
caá it be trade a question now ' They say now
thtt we cannot lestoie the deposites without secur-
ing the renewal of the bank charter. Who brought
us into this predicament' If this was the result,
it was the President who had produced it—that
person who had aheady taken^o much responsi-
bility in the affairs of this country bad brought us
into this predicament A talismame wand of
responsibility rules over the destinies of this coun-
try It was not the wand of a magician. He
exercises his spells covertly and in secret, a higher
poorer than his overrules the spirits of men by
ooenly assumed responsibility He would inquire
whether th s was the real question, and whether
we were prevented from collecting the procedure
of the Execu ive by the fear of perpetuating the
bank What is this new issue' At the beginning of
this trial, the question wis whether the Executive
exceeded the bounds of Ins constitutional powers
How w \s this got over' It was by instituting a
hunt of the«bank—a hunt, too, m which the bank
had no cnance foi escape, foi it was predetermined
thrt the object of the chase should be run down.
Tne accused oe.ng hopeless of defence, makes a
new iSbiie to save h'msell, and he did not at all
object to it The. Executive first submitted to this
House the question wnether the deposites in the
Baik of the Dinted States vveie safe The House,
aftei due dehbeietion, dceimmed that they were
safe, and expressed this detei nunation by an over-
whelming majiiuy oily a day or two before the
close of the session But the Executive will re-
mained unchanged, and it was determined that the
deposites should be removed vvitboutthe assent of
Cmgress, ¡rrangements were accoidmgly made,
Pist by transferring the Secretary of the Treasury
[Mi McLane") to another department, and next,
by appom ing an agent to make provision for the
futme depot, tt of the public money in the State
banks, and for the removal of the deposites from
the Bank of the IT., ted States An inquiry was
instituted,  not for the purpose of ascertaining
