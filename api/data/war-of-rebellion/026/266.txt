YORKTOWN. April 12, 1863-10.20 p. m.

I have just received a dispatch from Fort Magruder. All quiet there, but an attack on the redoubts is expected in the morning. Colonel West suggests that a gunboat stationed off College Creek, in James River, would prevent the enemy from turning his left and thus probably enable him to keep his line unbroken.

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General KEYES, Norfolk.

YORKTOWN, April 12, 1863-9 a. m.

Colonel WEST, Fort Magruder:

Do as you think best about drawing your pickets in closer to the forts. Keep me advised of any charge in the situation of affairs and of your wants. General Keyes telegraphs from Norfolk that the line between Williamsburg and Yorktown must be held at all hazards.

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MAGRUDER, April 12, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. C. SUYDAM:

I did not understand by your last dispatch whether Colonel Johnson's regiment is to remain or return. He wants to known so as to provide himself an fix camp where they are. There are no bridges on King's and College Creeks. The enemy did not cross the creek they stole down along College Creek and so around by the Brick Church road. They cannot do it again without my knowledge.

ROB'T M. WEST,

Commanding Advance Brigade.

APRIL 12, 1863.

Colonel WEST:

Colonel Johnson's regiment will remain with you for the present.

He had better get five days' supplies.

C. C. SUYDAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
