These returns show the number drafted in each district and the number rejected as physically or mentally unfit for military service, with the specific causes of the provost-marshals" returnees, as only two of the reports from surgeons gave that information. These returns are in some instances incomplete and do not cover the whole period embraced in the reports made by surgeons, so that the numbers reported as "rejected" do not correspond in the two returns, and the
