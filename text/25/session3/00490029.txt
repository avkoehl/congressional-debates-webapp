act There was a necessity for the passage of
the law, from the frightful surplus we had accu-
mulated But, sn, our part of the law has been
completed, the surplus has been distubuted, and
theTieasui v is compelled to an unconstitutional
issueof Pi casui y notes to sustam itself Wenave
apoealed to the avarice of the States, and how
have thty responded ' Instead of vigilance and
economy, the States have gone on in schemes of
unpaialleled extravagance Why appeal longer
to the vigilance of the States to contiol us in our
expenditures' He thought if he had known that,
instead of reclaiming the money deposited with
the States, when the Tieasuiy was exhausted,
the Seci<Hary would have boirowed monpy by a
foiced loan, he would have opposed, with the
Senator from Missouu, the passage of this law
He thought it had been mischievous m its opera-
tions, in some iespects,and acceleiated the fiscal
calamities undei which we have so lately suffered
But it was not the sole ause Theie was an an
tagonist system for getting rid of the surplus by
enormous ippiopuationsfoi extravagant and use-
less objects, and though our system prevailed, we
incieased our expcndftuics even after oui surplus
was deposited with the States We had bounded
rapidly fiom a suiplus of ¿60,000,000 ind dn ap-
propriation of ^40,000,000 to an insohent Tieas
ury Rut the deposit act had failed in the great
object pioposed by its enactment, and, having
failed, is it coirect to continue it upon the statute-
book' Is there any piooabihty of any poition
of the money being "hereafter íeclaimed fiom the
States' Why, then, continue it' He had acted
in good faith when voting for that bill, he had
voted foi it as a deposit act, a deposit which
would be called for, and ought to be called foi,
when needed for the exigencies of the Govern
merit He was deceived He concuned with the
Senator fiom Missouri that the act had a squint
ing towaids raising a revenue foi distribution,
and on that giound was for o Uteiating it
Mi TALL/MADGE said 1 e should vote for
the amendment, as he was about to use to oiler
a similai one, when he was anticipated by his
friend fiom Kentucky His oo]ect having thus
been accomplished, he designed to sit still and
give a silent vote on the question, but some gen
tlemen had seen fit to go into the merits of the
deposit act, which they pleased to teim a distri-
bution bill He had said on a former occasion,
that whenever genilemon thought pioper to dis-
cuss the meiits of that bill, he would not sit still
a silent hstcnei He took an active part in the
passage of that act, believing that he was right
then, and he believed so now Gentlemen talked
of a deception when that bill was passed Sn,
(said Mi T ,) theie was no dect) uon and no
misconception The mattei was peifeetly undei-
stood, and this body put the bill in a shape to
obviate all difficulties The bill as it was irigin
ally intioduced wis not a distubution act, but one
for a mere deposit with the States But genth
men say that the effect of it was a distribution
Why, Geneial Jackson himstlf lecommcnded an
absolute distubution thiee times over1 Twice in
his annual messages, and again in his veto mes
sage on the lai d bill, and when he heaid thatob-
]ec ions had been ra sed in Congiess as to the
unconstitutionality of the measure, he icom
mended that theConstitution should be so amended
as to lemove any d mbts on the subje t \t that
time no objections weic heard from his fnend^,
no, sir, it was their paity doctrine, but when the
time arrived that we had a surplus levuuit fir
beyond what had been anticipated,and th piop-
osition was madt, not foi an absolute dis nbeUion,
but for a deposit w ith the States, tne whole mat
ter was changed—the Pitsident changed his opm
ions, and his ft lends changed thens I hat bill,
howevei, passed tht Senate with only six dissent-
ing voices How was it, that it had been icceivcd
with so much dissaasf etion in different pans of
the coun iy' It was bt cause it had offended a
paity The official organ heie denounced it, and
denounced eveiy man who voted foi it—though
every member of that body but six -soled for it,
and it wis the veiy measuie previously lecom-
mcnüed by the Piesident Now, how did that
bill pass' When gentlemen talk about giving
tins money to the States,let us look and set how
it is
bu, (said Mr T ,) we adopted an amendment
by which thib money was kept within the contiol
ofCongiess It was pi ovided that it should be
distubuted among the States in the ratio of their
leprcsentation, who should give their ceitificates
foi theamounts received by them, and that when-
ever it should be wanted for the purposes of the
Government, the Secretary of the Treasui y should
sell the certificates in the market, which should,
from the time of sal<, bcai an interest of the per
cent That amendment placed the money entirely
under the coitiol of the Government, it was
placed in the hands of the States, who could use
it for valuable objects, without interest, until the
Government wanted it The State of New York,
for instance, invested her quota m her school
fund, which was laying a firmer foundation for
national defense than if it had been expended in
brick and tnoi tar in a new system of fortifications,
as the gentleman from Missoui i wanted to expend
it, and if this system of fortifications had been
carried out, it must in the end have bankiup ed
the Treasury, for these fortifications would either
have gone into dilapidation, or they must have
appiopnatcd millions annually to keep them up
Had the deposit act passed both Houses as it
passed heie, there nevei would have been a neces-
sity to call on the States for tins money, or to
issue Treasury notes The Secretary of the
Tieasury would have had the power to sell these
ceitificates in the market, which would have been
a good financial operation, and the money could
have been obtained for the wants of the Govern-
ment without putting the States to the slightest
inconvenience The bill, howevei, was amended
in the other House, on the suggestion of the Pres-
ident, and by that amendment this invaluable fea-
tuie was stricken out, and in lieu of it, it was
provided that the Secretary might draw on the
States foi small installments, by giving a short
pievious notice
Why, then, did not the Secretary diaw for this
money in accordance with the provisions of the
act Perhaps he thought the notice was too long,
and the installments too small, and perhaps he
did not caie to incur the lesponsibility of tins
mode of proceeding With this view of the case,
was it right for gentlemen to complain of this act
as a distribution 3 Why, there was no such pnn-
ciple advocated or adopted here The pimciple
contended for was a deposit with the States where
the Government could command it when wanted
Had the measure been carried out as advocated
and adopted in the Senate, we should have had
no difficulties, and the States would not have been
embarrassed by a call for money which they had
laid out in useful objects Gentlemen said that
the Government was about to be committed to
the system of distubution by the adoption of this
motón This was not so The Government
would be no moie committed than it was on a for-
mer occasion, when the same postpoij ment of
the fouith installment was made in the teims now
proposed There would be no commitul at ah,
and he was for having the postponement piaced
in the situation which tins amendment contem-
plated, so that it si ould lequne the action ofCin-
giess to postpone it again, and, if theie should be
a suiplus, it would not be in the powei of one
House, or of the veto of the Executive, to pie
ventits being paid over to the Siates When^en
tlemen talked of committing the Government, they
weie committed aueady They «ay (continued
"VIi T ) that we aie to have no m m suipluses
That might be so but in some of the elections
lately held at his State, he heard it aiatied thitin
case we had anotnei suiplus we ought to have a
sub Tieasuiy, in oidci that the banks night not
get it to expand then issues on He, foi oi e,
would not consent to put it out of the power of
Consrcss to pay this fourth i istaliment, if both
Houses thought it light to do so not would he
tgiee to put it in the | ovvci of the Executive veto
to pieveut the States fiom leccivmg this money
Mr CALHOUN felt very little interest as to
what disposition was made of the motion He
was willing to postpon  the foui th installment for
a ye ii, m to postpone it indefinitely as in the bill,
oi to tcpeal the deposit law ahogethei That act
had peifoimed its functions, and there was now
no leason for retaining it on the statute hook He
had no appiehension that there would be any
surplus revtnue to dispose of between this and
the year 1842, and for many yeais theieaftei, and
if any gentleman would move a repeal of the bill,
he would cheei fully vote for it     That act had
performed a most important part It was not sur-
pnsing that those who opposed it on its passage
should condemn it now, but he was, he confessed,
greatlj, surprised to heai those who zealously ad-
vocated it, condemn it and treat it as deceptive.
Sn, (said Mi C ,) theie was no deception If
theie was a deception, then I am the deceiver, and
I  tiust that those who know me know that decep-
tion is the last fault that I could be charged with,
that, whatever might be his fault's, ho always
moved directly upon his object He never con-
sidered this act in any other light than as a de-
posit, but he avowed, at the time, that he never
thought that this money would be called for, ex-
cept in case of a war with some European Power
Sir, (said Mi C ,) after having openly made this
avowal, I little expected to hear it said that a de-
ception was practiced The deposit act was a
noble act, necessary to meet the political disease
that was pieymg on the vitals of the community,
and doing moie to corrupt the public motáis than
any evil that had befallen us since the beginning
of the Government It was a departure ft om that
saired pi mciple, deeply so in our Government,
of raising no more money by taxation than was
necessary for the economical support of the Gov -
eminent, that had caused the evils this act was
passed to coi rect It was in 1824 and 1828 that
that sacred pimciple was depaited from, by which
the Asiatic pomon of the Union, as the South
has jlist been called, was so deeply depressed, and
extravagance and waste intioduced into oui sys-
tem of expendituies It was not the distribution
act which had pioduced the late pecuniary em-
barrassments, both public and private It was
the acts of 1824 and 1828 which violated this prm*
ciple, and by which, out of an import of $64,000,000
in one year, §32,000,000 passed into the Treasui y,
íaised out of the southern staple, which was a
tax beyond what the most despotic Government
on earth had ever levied What was the effect'
Money overflowed in the Treasui} , so that the
utmost extiavagance of Congress was insufficient
to get rid of it
He heaid an honorable member of the other
House sav that it would be bettei to raise this
money and throw jt into the ocean than not to
keep up the piotecting tariff What followed >
Why, m spite of the most extravagantappropn-
ations, Congress could not possibly expend the
accumulated surplus Two propositions weie
made to dispose of it one was for all sorts of
extravagant expenditures, and the other was the
plain, simple, honest plan of returning it to the
people fiom whom it came, and that was the de-
posit act I he possession of the surplus was the
curse, and those who had voted for the tariff laws
of 1834 and 1828 were responsible This act ar-
lested the surplus revenue, and more, it stopped
the tiansfer of millions of the public acies into the
hands of the speculators, who got hold of the
public monev and with it bought up the public
domain This was the tiue ■atate of things, and
he was s'ad of having an oppoitumty of making
this explaninon Ihen the banks susnended
specu  p ) ments, and this had been attributed to
II  e d< posit act He wished to S| eak with can-
dor He had no doubt that the deposit act and
tin specie circular acceleiated the explosion of
the banks bu! m aeceh latmg It it limited the evil,
fo if the explosion had been delayed six months
longer the calamity would have been threefold
trreater It had been said that the Tieasury was
destitute of money He admitted that the Gov-
ernment was forced into the necegsaiy vntue of
economy, and instead of being able to expend
millions extravagantly, it must i ovv limit its ex-
penses to justandnecessaly obje ts Ruthespoke
what eveiv man knew when lu said that there
had been a melancholy lie nnration of the public
morals foi the last ten oi twelve years, anil this
had ausen fiom the injuuous policy of diawmg
moie moneyfiom the people than was necessaiy
foi the Government He would not dwell longei
on this question, but wou'd ou'y icmaik that,
when the fu m< lnstoiian came to wnte the his-
toiy of this counti" nom 1824 to this time, this
medbuif, so condemned now, would be considered
as one of the wisest and best measuies that had
ever been biought before Coi gress In all this
he wished to be undei stood as s tying that there
was not aman in that Chamber who was more op-
posed to a d istribution than he was He resorted
to it as a remedy rendered imperiously necessaiy
