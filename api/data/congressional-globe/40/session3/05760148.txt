The 'opening of the Erie' canal was an epoch
& the commerce of fte coprifry',"b'at it-exerted
for the first-ten yea'rstut little influelK>« treyond
the rcSnte immediately traversed." So late ag
1836 the total amount of tonnage from the
western States coming through this channel to
tide-water equaled only 56,000 tons. Before the
western States could avail themselves of it,
thev had to connect their territories with it and
■mill the lakes by canals or by the best earth
roads they could construct. In 1816 the amount
bf Western produce reachi ng tide-water by canal
4.19,000 tons. In 1851, the date of the open-
i©£ the Erie railroad and the removal of the
restrictions on the transportation of freight on
New York Central railroad, (which was first
opened-ia* the fall of 1842,) the tonnage of
western- produce on the canal had reached
Q6£,-993 tons. This tonnage measured to a very
great extent the commerce then existing be-
tween the eastern and, western States. In
1867 the united through tonnage of the five
great lines between the two sections—the Erie
xc&nal, the New York Central, Erie, Pennsyl-
vania, and Baltimore and Ohio railroads—
equaled 6,000,000 tons, having a value of
-11,200,000,000.
In 'the light of these facts and figures I sub-
mit, Mr. Speaker, that it is wise statesmanship
Tor the nation to aid these great lines of Pacific
railway, now petitioners at our doors. Yet
there is another grand duty kindred, indeed,
urgently claiming the attention of Congress,
which I would briefly discuss. Railroads are
continental, but the ocean washes'all lands; and
if \ve would be "a power among the nations"
we must command the seas. Pirate craft built
in English waters by English gold and manned
with English seameu and permitted to go to
sea by an English Government, joined later by
the depreciated condition of our currency and
the heavy impost on all shipbuilding materials
and ship supplies have annihilated more than
fifty per cent, of our tonnage. "VVe must not
resign our strength upon the ocean; and it
seems to me, sir, almost the first duty of the
American Congress to legislate for its rescue.
I give interesting statistics, setting forth both
the growth and decline of our commerce, found
in a valuable paper on "American shipping,"
by an observant merchant of Boston :
41 In 1789 our shipping comprised about 200,000 tons.
On the 30th of Juno. 1861, ithad reached 5,500,000tons,
and was nearly as large as that of all the maritime
nations combined, excepting Great Britain. At the
latterdate theUnited States had attained a position
in the first rank among the maritime Powers; our flag
was seen iu every port upon the globe; our merchants
wero competing suceessfullyfor the traffic, under can-
vas, of every occan; and they participated with profit
even in the carrying tradebetween different, ports of
the British empire. This great interest had been to
that time a source of strength to our Government, a
source of wealth to our people. But since 1801 the
almost uninterrupted growth of three quarters of a
century has been tevcrsed, and a steady decline h.w
been going on winch, it would seem, is still in prog-
ress, and which must bo expected to continue unless
arrested by prompt, earnest, and adequate measures
of relief.
"The total tonnage of the United States on the 30th
of June, 1867, is given by the Rrgisterof the Treasury
Department at 3,868.615tons. The total reported on
the 30th of June, 1861, was 5,539,818 tons, which was
the highest point ever gained by us. The decline
for the six years thus indicated is 1,671,198 tons, or
about thirty per cent. But in order to be precise in
our statements of fact, and intelligent, therefore, in
our judgment, itis necessary to separate the national
tonnage into two divisions—that which is employed
in the internal commerce of the country upon the
rivers and lakes and along our coast, and that which
is engaged in foreign trade. The figures for tho
former, or, as it is called, the enrolled and licensed
tonnage, are as follows:
In 1861 2,807,185
In 1867   2,514,380
Difference  382,805
" Wehavehere a falling off of thirteen percent. But,
although the tonnage of 1861, as a whole, exceeded
that of any year before or since, the enrolled and
licensed tonnage reached its highest point in 1864:
In 1864 it was : 3,404,506
In 1887 it was 2,214,380
"This &OW8adecliriedufingthreeye&rs,in the
internal water-borne transportatiwi facilities ot tue
country of twenty-six per cent. But we do nothcre
see the full decline.- Since the 30th 6f June, 1864, a
new method of measuring vessels has been in us© in
the United States, and many spaces are now included
in the measurement which before were not taken
into the account. The proportion between the new
system and the old changes with every difference ot
model, and it is difficult to reach an exact estimate
in reference to it; the authorities of the Department
think that from ten to fifteen per cent, would cover
it. If we subtract only ten per cent, from the tonnage
of 1867, to bring it to tho same terms with that oil o4,
we have the lollowing result:
Domestic tonnage in 1864 .....3,404,506
Domestic tonnage in 1867; 2,514,380
Less ten per cent   2 262 942

" "\te have declined, it would seem. in our domestic
tonnage, thirty-three per cent, in the last three years;
and these years, be it remembered, were years of
peace, and of at least average commercial activity.
If this is the condition of the coasting trade, which
is jealously protected against all competition from
without, what is likely to both© casein regard to the
registered tonnage, that is, the tonnage engaged in
foreign commerce, in rivalry with all the world l
The official report gives us the following information:
1861, registered tonnage, sail  2,540,020
1861, registered tonnage, steam  102,G08
Difference...    890,126

1867, registered tonnage, steam  1/3,520
2,642,628
1,354,235
Difference..
1.288,393
" This shows aloss of nearly fifty per cent. But, as
before, if we would reach the exact truth, we must
allow for the new system of admeasurement.
Registered tonnage, 1861 ............ 2,642,628
Registered tonnage, 1867  1,354,2.)5
Less ten per cent  135,423
 1.218,812
1,423,816
" The absolute decline, therefore, in the foreign ton-
nage of the country, from 1861 to 1867, has been fifty-
four per cent., or nearly a million and a half tons.
" Let us examine this state of things in another
aspect. From almost the beginning of our history
as a nation our traffic upon the sea has been steadily
increasing, with occasional reverses, as between 1811
and 1814, and 1818 and 1825. Even during the period
of the last war with Great Britain our foreign ton-
nage fell off only twelve and a half per cent., although
it should be said that during the two years previous
to that war it fell off twenty-two per cetft. Wo have
prepared the following table for the purpose of indi-
cating the changes which have taken place in the
registered tonnageof the country forthe eight yenis
from 1789 to 1797, and from 1797, by decades, to 1867:

"This table shows an average gain of eighty snd
a half per eent. for the periods given, including the
remarkable growth which took place between 1789
and 1797, when, in consequence of the wars then
prevailing among the maritime Powers of Europe,
our foreign tonnage increased three hundred and
eighty-four and a half per cent., and including also
the decades between 1807 and 1827, when there was a
decrease of five and a half and six and a half per
cent., respectively. As the period from 1789 to 1797
may be considered exceptional, let us look at the
growth of our foreign tonnage during the three de-
cades between 1827 and 1857; the first of these shows
an increase of only eight andahalf percent., andyet
the average of the three is fifty-three and three
eighths per cent. In looking forward in 1857 through
the coming ten years, it would not have been thought
extravagant to anticipate an increase equal to tho
average of the previous thirty years. Let us see how
much this difference really is, between what in 1857
would not have been an unreasonable anticipation,
and the existing fact:
In 1857 our foreign or registered tonnage was, 2,463,967
Add fifty-one and three eighths per cent.
for the average growth per decade from
1827 to 1857  1,315,142
Our tonnage might have been expected to
reach in 1867  3,779,109
Our actual tonnage in 1867, was 1,354,235
Allow ten per cent, for new system
of admeasurement  135,423
 1,218,812
Showing a net difference of ,....2,560,297
or instead of again of fifty-three and three eighths
per cent., a loss of-sixty-eightper cent.; and leaving
our foreign tonnage less than one third oi what in
1857 we should have heen justified by past experi-
ence in estimating that it would be."
•With this showing, patent to all the world,
is it riot our duty to readjust our tariff rates,
now discriminating so injuriously against this
right arm ot' the nation's power and wealth,
and make haste to get back to the rock bottom
on which the nations of the earth transact busi-
ness? How can our shipping interest, with our
depreciated currency, compete in the maritime
centers of the globe with tonnage built on a
gold basis?
As the result of the depreciation of our cur-
rency and the severity of our taxation we have
it on the authority of a member of this House,
Hon. Mr. Pike, of Maine, that a thousand-
ton ship would cost a builder of his State
$85,000 in currency, while a similar vessel
could be bmltin the adjoining British provinces
for $45,000 in gold; and, as was truly said by
this gentleman in the House last winter :
"It is apparent that our ships cannot compete with
foreign ships, when the difference of cost is so great,
unless a corresponding advantage is in some way
given to them in the way of employment But the
House is aware that an American ship has no such
advantages. -She competes with her great rival on a
free-trade basis. The St. John ship comes into the
port of New xork and gets the same freight and is
subject to the same insurance as the American ship.
The only privilege the American ship has is that of
the coastwise trade, and that is hardly appreciable."
But the great blow given" our commerce was
dealt by the English-built pirates, andtheper-
fidious English Government should be held to
the sternest accountability. A recent writerin
one of our popular magazines treats of this sub-
ject with such excellent sense that I must beg
indulgence while I give a page or two of his
sterling argument:
" The'restoration of amity with Great Britain is of
the utmost importance to both nations. It is not
merely the amount of our claim and interest, now
seven millions sterling, a largo portion of which is
held by English insurance companies, thatis involved,
but great interests of both nations suffer from the
questions between them, and the British provinces
suffer more than either nation. While Great Britain
asserts her claim to San Juan, denies compensation
for all our losses, even for the ships of our whalemen
burned in time ofpeace by her cruisers in.the Arctic
sea, and declines to punish any of her pirates who
return to her ports after their ravages on tho deep;
while she seeks to awe the United States by military
roads and new batteries at Halifax and Victoria;
while she arrests our naturalized citizens, and claims
their allegiance after she has banished them from her
soil and we have adopted them—hostile tariffs, con-
sular fees, and interdicts must succeed to rao/ter^ite
duties and treaties of reciprocity. Great Britain
requires the wheat of California and Minnesota, the
corn, beef, and pork ot Illinois, the petroleum,bark,
and clover-seed of Pennsylvania, atleastthirty thou-
sand tons of the cheese of New York and New Eng-
land, and the market which eightmillion prosperous
families afford. We require her metals, chemicals,
and other products. We need tho fisherman's salt,
wood, and timber, the herrings, alewives, salmon,
esrgs, cattle, wool, barley, white wheat, and potatoes
of Canada; and Canada needs our corn, tobacco,
pork, carriages, coal, and manufactures.
"The townships which lie between the St. Law-
rence and Isi ew England can best supply our factory
towns with hay, oats, barley, cattle, horses, and po-
tatoes in exchange for the products of New England.
England has ever held her colonies with tenacity,
but her American provinces have now grown to
man's estate; she has abandoned her colonial sys-
tem, and draws her pine and spruce chiefly from
Norway ; she gives her colonists no priority in her
markets. They have few interests in common with
her; for the last decade their trade has been chiefly
with us, and not with each other. Nova Scotia is
eommcrcial; New Brunswick is devoted to ship-
building and lumber; Canada and Prince Edward
Island are agricultural.. While they might easily
enter as States into our Republic, they are not ho-
mogeneous, and Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
would bo powerless in Canada. At the present mo-
ment Great Britain incurs an annual expense of four
or five millions sterling to protect them iroin the
Fenians, and derives from their trade no equivalent
for the outlay. As members of our Union they would
partake of a coasting-trade we cannot concede to
British subjects, and enjoy the free trade of a conti-
nent. If our debt is larger than theirs, our wealth,
population, and resources arc proportionate to our
interest. The possession of tho provinces weakens
Great Britain : it would add to the strength and com-
merce of our Union. It would bring to us an amount
of shipping which would compensate for two thirds
of our losses by the war. In the century which ex-
pires in 1869 our population will have increased from
two and a half millions to forty millions, or sixteen-
