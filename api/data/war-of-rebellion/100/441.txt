Lieutenant-Colonel CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

There are some eighty condemned wagons here, claimed as property of the State, that have been sold and notes taken in payment, payable one year hence to whoever may be State treasurer at that time. It is also claimed that General Schofield intimates that he would not interfere with the transaction. Will you please notify me of his desire in the matter.

Major General J. D. COX,

The major-general commanding desires me to say that the sale of the condemned wagons is not approved. They were used for army purposes, and are therefore supposed to belong to the United States.

Respectfully,
