In arranging for the exchange was no provision made to bring away the sick and feeble? Should not such have been cared for first? Thinking that perhaps the matter had been overlooked by the Government we call your attention to it, earnestly requesting that you will as soon as possible take such measures in their behalf as you think best. We have more than a general interest for two or three from our own town are among the number. We believe that it is unparalleled in the history of civilized warfare that men who have fought nobly for their country and have been taken prisoners on the field of battle should be overlooked or uncared for in an exchange of prisoners, and should be left shelterless on an island, exposed to the vertical rays of the sun and scarcely food enough to keep them alive simply because of the expense or trouble of providing a conveyance for them. We would not complain. If there is no relief we submit. The object of this communication is to call your attention to the facts, believing that you will do all in your power to secure their release.

We are, very respectfully, yours,
