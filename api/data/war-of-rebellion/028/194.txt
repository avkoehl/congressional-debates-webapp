out to Clarksburg. These regiments I have ordered to scout over the road to the Frederick and Baltimore turnpike, and keep me informed of the enemy's movements. My position here is not very good. I shall move back a couple of miles, to cover some roads now in my rear. Two regiments are still at Darnestown. All quiet at last accounts.

Dispatch of 11.40 a. m. received. When the regiment arrived at Mechanicsville, I shall have the country thoroughly picketed from the Potomac, at Seneca Mill, to Cooksville, on the Baltimore and Frederick turnpike. My stations are: Darnestown, two regiments; Middlebrook, one regiment; Brookville, one regiment; and the pickets extend to clarksburg, Seneca Bridge, on the road to Poolesville, and near Edwards Ferry. At these points they crossed large forces of all arms. I have the Potomac, below Edwards Ferry, thoroughly picketed. The regiment to report to me at rockville I shall post at Brookville, to scout the country and picket on our right and front. at this point I have two batteries and three regiments, doing picket and station duty. General Sumner has some forces within 2 miles of my rear, and I have kept him posted about matters in front. Cannot spare map, but will give you a tracing if you will send me some tracing paper. Your dispatch of 2 p.m. received. just heard form front that large clouds of dust are seen about Sugar Loaf Mountain.

General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Just heard from First New York Cavalry at Middlebrook, which has four companies at Clarksburg, picketing the roads in that vicinity, and at Neilsville. Colonel McReynolds reports that he has heard form two respectable Union citizens, on e of them who left Barnesville before daylight this morning, that the rebels have a large force in and around Barnesville (some 30,000 or 40,000 men), under Jackson; that they had, at noon to-day, extended their pickets to within 3 miles of Clarskburg, and that the loyal citizens had been compelled to take down their Union flags, by the threats of their rebel neighbors, who boastingly said the rebels would occupy Clarksburg to-night. It is 6 miles from Clarksburg to Middlebrook. I think the firing to-night was at Clarksburg, on my pickets. Can you hurry up that regiment at Mechanicsville?
