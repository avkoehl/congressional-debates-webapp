Brigadier General FRANK C. ARMSTRONG,Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: Your dispatches from Holly Springs by Dr. Webb and from La Grange by telegraph have been received, and the major-general commanding instructs me to say that measures will be promptly taken to give an efficient support to the movement suggested in his dispatch of the 27th to you, and adopted in yours of the 28th instant. He is confirmed in the opinion that is the proper movement, but he does not make his instructions imperative. He expects you, however, to keep him fully advised of your whereabouts. Colonel Falkner reports that he inflicted a severe loss upon the enemy in his late operations, with the loss of only one man captured.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. L. SNEAD,

Chief of Staff.
