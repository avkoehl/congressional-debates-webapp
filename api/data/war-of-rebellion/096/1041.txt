XLI. It having been made known to this Department that the communications with Richmond have been interrupted, in consequence of the damage sustained by the railroad and canals from the late heavy rains and freshets, and that the necessary supplies for the Army of Northern Virginia cannot be obtained by ordinary means, and that a resort to extraordinary means must be had in the present emergency, the Commissary-General of Subsistence will impress for the immediate use of the army such supplies of subsistence as may be presently required. For this purpose he is authorized to exert whatever powers are allowed by the laws regulating impressments. more than one-half the supplies on hand for his family use will not be taken from any one owner.

It is expected that the present emergency will be of short duration, and it is hoped that there will be a patriotic response to this unforeseen call upon the people.
