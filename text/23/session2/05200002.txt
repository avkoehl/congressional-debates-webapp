failed by natuie, will ho distinguished for their
love of justice and thtu devotion to those peace-
ful arts, the assiduous cultivation of \\ Inch confers
honor upon nations and gives value to human life
In the mean time I confidently hope, that the ap

of these mxuuant legions may be tempted, m a
moment of unwoithy distrust of then own capa-
city for the enjoyment of hbeity, to commit the
too common enor of purchasing piesent lepóse
by bestowing on some favoiite leadeis the fatal
gift of irresponsible powci, will not be leahzed

Tuesday, December 2, 1834
The Hon Mr Morris, one of the Senators
from Ohio, appeared, and took his seat.
Mr WHITE, fiom the committee appointed
to wait upon the Piesident of the United States,
m conjunction with a similar committee from the
House of Repicsentatives,to inform him that the
two Houses of Congiess were organized, and
íeady to íeceive any communication he maybe
pleased to make, repoi ted that they had perfoi med
the duty assigned to them, and that the Piesi-
dent gave mfoi mation that he would make a com-
munication to both Houses this day, at twelve
o'clock
The following message was then received fiom
the President of the United State; , by A J Don-
elsov, Esq , his Pnvate Secretary
Fellow Citizetis of the Senate
and House oj Repi esenlalwes
In peiformmg my duty at the opening of youi
piesent session, it gives me pleasuie to congratu
late you again upon the prospeious condition of
our beloved country Divine Piovidence has
favored us with geneial health, with rich rewaids
m the fields of aguculture and in eveiy bianch of
laboi, and with peace to cultivate and extend the
vinous resomces which employ the virtue and
enteipuso of our citizens Let us trust that, m
sun eying a scene so flattering to oui tree institu-
tions, oui joint deliberations to pieseive them
may be crowned with success
Oui foreign i elation" continue, with but few ex
ceptions, to maintain the favoiable aspect which
they bore in my last annual message, and prom-
ise to extend those advantages which the princi-
ples thatiegukte oui intercom se with othei na-
tions are so well calculated to secure.
The question of the northeastern boundaiy is
still pending with Gieat Butam, and the pioposi-
tion made m accoidance with the resolution of
the Senate for the establishment of a line accoid-
ing to the treaty of 1783, his not been accepted
by that Government Believing that eveiy dispo-
sition is felt on both sidisto adjust this peiplex
mg question to the satisfaction of all the parties
inteiested in it, the hope is yet indulged that it
may" be effected on the basis of that pioposition
With the Governments of Austria, Russia,
Piussia, Holland,Sweden,andDenmaik, the best
understanding exists Commcice, with all, is
fostered and piotccted by íecipiocal good will,
undci the sanction of libeial conventional oi le-
gal pi o visions
In the midst of hei internal difficulties, the
Guccn of Spam has latifiedthe Convention for
the payment of the claimsof oui citizens ansjng
sine e 1S19 It is in the course of execution on
her pai t, and a copy of it is nefw laid before you
foi such legislation as may be found necessary
to enable those interested to derive the benefits
of it
Yielding; to the foice of circumstances, and to
the wise counsels of time and expenence, that
powii has finally resolved no longer to occupy
the unnatuial position in which she stood to the
new Gov ei nments established in this hemisphere
I have the great satisfaction of stating to you that,
hi piepanng the way for the rtstoiation of hai-
mony between those who have sprung from the
same aneestois, who are allied by common mtei-
ests, profess the same íehgion, and speak the
same language, the United States have been
actively mstiumenta! Our efforts to effect this
good woik will be peiseveied m while they aie
deemed useful to the paities, and our entire dis-
interestedness continues to be felt and undei stood
The act of Congiess, to countervail the discnm
mating duties levied, to the prejudice of our nav
igation,in Cuba and Poito Rico, has been trans
mitted to the Minister of the United States at
! Madnd, to be communicated to the Government
of the Q,ueen No íme'ligence of its receipt has
yet reached the Department of State If the
piesent condition of the countiy peimits the
Government to make a caieful and enlarged ex-
amination of the tiue interests of these important
portions of its dominions, no doubt isenteitained
that their future mteicouise with the United
States will be placed upon a more just and libeial
basis.
The Florida archives have not yet been selected
and dehveied Recent orders have been sent to
the agent of the United States at Havana, to íe-
tuin with all thathe can obtain,so that they may
be m Washington before the session of the Sú-
pleme Couit, to be used in the legal questions
theie pending, to which the Government is a
paity
Internal tranquillity is happily restored to Por-
tugal The distracted state of the countiy i en
deied unavoidable the postponement of a final
payment of the just claims of oui citizens Oui
diplomatic relations will be soon íesumed, and
the long-subsisting fuendship with that Powei
affords the strongest guarantee that the balance
due will íeceivcpiompt attention
The first installment due under the convention
of indemnity with the King of the Two Sicilies,
has been duly íectived, and an offei has been
made to extinguish the whole by a piompt pay-
ment—an offer I did not considei myself authoi-
ized to accept, as the indemnification provided
is the exclusive propeity of individual citizens of
the United States The original adjustment of
our claims, and the anxiety displayed to fulfill at
once the stipulations made for the payment of
them, aie highly honorable to the Government of
the Two Sicilies When it is lecollected that
they were the result of the injustice of an intru-
sive power, temporallly dommantmitsteriitory,
a íepugnance to acknowledge and to pay which
would have been neither unnatural nor unex-
pected, the encumstances cannot fail to exalt its,
character for justice and good faith in the eyes of
all nations
The treaty of amity and commerre between
the'Umted States and Belgium, biought to your
notice m my last annual message, as sanctioned
by the Senate, but the ratifications of which had
rot been exchanged, owing to a delay in its recep-
tion at Biussels, and a subsequent absence of the
Belgian Minister of Foieign Affairs, has been,
after matine deliberation, finally disavowed by
that Government as inconsistent with the poweis
and instiuctionsgiven to then Mimstei who nego-
tiated it This disavowal was entuely unex
pected, as the libeial principles imbodied in the
convention, and which form the groundwork of
the objections to it, were peifectly satisfactoiy to
the Belgian lepiescntativc, and were supposed to
be not only within the poweis granted, butex-
piessly conformable to the instiuctions given to
lnm An oflei, not yet accepted, has been made
by Belgium to renew negotiations for a tieaty less
liberal in its provisions, on questions of general
maritime law
Oui newly established relations with the Su-
blime Porte piomise to be useful tooui commerce,
and satisfactory, in evei y respect, to this Govern- I
ment Our intercourse with the Baibary Powers
continues without impoitant change, except that
the piesent political state of Algiers has induced
me to teimmate the íesidence theie of a salaried
consul, and to substitute an oidmary consulate,
to íemain so long as the place continues in the
possession of Fiance Our fiist tieaty with one
of these Powers—the Empeior of Moioeco—was
foimedrn 1760, and was limited to fifty years
That period has almost expired I shall take
measures to lenew it with the gieatersatisfaetion,
as its stipulations are just and liberal, and have
been, with mutual fidelity and reeipiocal advant-
age, sciupulously fulfilled
Intestine dissensions have too frequently oc-
cuned to mai the piospenty, inteiiupt the com
merco, and distract the Governments of most of
the nations of fins hemispheic which have sepa-
rated themselves fiom Spain When a fiim and
permanent understanding with the paientcountry
shall have produced a foi mal acknowledgment of
their independence, and the idea of danger fiom
delay for the íeasonsanticipated—the prevalence
of civil war The commissioners and suiveyois
not having met within the time stipulated by the
tieaty, a new anangement became necessary, and
our chaigé d'affanes was instructed, in Januaiy
last, to negotiate, in Mexico, an article additional
to the preexisting tieaty This lnstiuction was
acknowledged, and no difficulty was apprehended
in the accomplishment of that object By in
I formation just íeceived, that additional ai tide to
the treaty will be obtained, and transmitted to
this country as soon as it can receive the íatifi-
cation of the Mexican Congiess
The íeumon of the thiee States of New Gran-
ada, Venezuela, and Equador,forrmng the Repub-
lic of Colombia, seemseveiy day to become more
impiobable. The commissioneis oí the two first
aie undeistood to be now negotiating ajustdivis-
lonofthe obligations contiacted by them when
united under one Government The civil wai m
Equadol, it is believed, has pieventtd even the
appointment of a commissionci on its pait
I propose, at an eaily day, to submit, in the
propti foim, the appointment of a diplomatic
agent to Venezuela, the importance of the com-
merce of that country to the United States, and
the large claims of oui citizens upon the Govern-
ment, ansmg before and since the division of
Colombia, tendering it, in myjudgment, improper
''longei to delay this step
Our representatives to Central America, Peiu,
and Brazil, are cither at, oi on their way to, then
respective posts
From the Argentine Republic, fiom which a
minister was expected to this Gov 11 nmc nt, nothing
further has been heaid Occasion has been take n,
on the depaiture of a new consul to Buenos
Ayies, to remind that Government, that its long
delayed minister, whose appointment had been
made known to us, had not ai rived
It becomes my unpleasant duty to inform you
that this pacific and highly giatifymg picture of
our foreign íelitions docs not include those with
Fiance at this time. It is not possible that any
Government and people could be more sinceiely
desnous of conciliating a just and futndlv inter
course with anothei nation, than aie those of the
United States with their ancient ally and fnend
This disposition is founded, as well on the most
giateful and honoiable lecollections assocuted
with our struggle foi independence, as upon a
well-grounded conv ictioii th it it is consonant with
thetiue policy of both The people of the United
States could not, therefoie, see, without the di ep-
est íegiet, even a tomporaiy mtenuption of the
friendly relations between the two counting—a
regret which would, I am sure, be greatly asgia-
vated, if theie should tuin out to be any reasonable
giouiid for attributing such a íesult to any act or"
