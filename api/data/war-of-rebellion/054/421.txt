First Kentucky and Forty-fifth Ohio, to assist him; met the enemy about 2 miles beyond here. The First Kentucky was in the advance and driven back in confusion. I succeeded in rallying a portion of them, and was driving them slowly when I got your letter. They are now formed about 2 1/2 miles from here. I fear Captain Drye, First Kentucky, was killed. Out loss, besides Major Graham's, is small. I can fall back without further trouble.

Respectfully,
