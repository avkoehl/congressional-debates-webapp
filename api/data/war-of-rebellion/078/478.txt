O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

MEMPHIS, TENN., September 25, 1864.

Brigadier General E. HATCH,

White's Station, Tenn.:

Bell's brigade is reported to be in WEST Tennessee. You will send a scout of 100 men to-morrow morning toward Bolivar to obtain all possible information of the movements of the enemy. Send me report upon their return.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

CITY POINT, VA., September 26, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

It will be better to drive Forrest from Middle Tennessee as a first step, and do anything else that you may feel your force sufficient for. When a movement is made on any part of the sea-coast I will advise you. If Hood goes to the Alabama line, will it not be impossible for him to subsist his army?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
