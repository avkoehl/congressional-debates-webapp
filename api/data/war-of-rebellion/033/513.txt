rely on the White River. I have not the troops to send. Send this to General Halleck. If you can reach Blunt, inform him that Cooper and Cabell are concentrating on Little Rock.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

General Schofield being still in Kansas, I forward this.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 5, 1863.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The following telegram is sent you for your information:
HEADQUARTERS ARKANSAS EXPEDITION,Devall's Bluff, Ark., August 31, via Memphis, September 3, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The rebel troops, including Marmaduke, are positively west of Bayou Meto. They are fortifying themselves this side of Little-Rock, General Price in command, who intends to hold us in check until Kirby Smith collects his forces at Little Rock. I advance to-day.

FRED'K STEELE.

J. M. SCHOFIELD.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 5, 1863.

Major-General POPE, Milwaukee, Wis:

GENERAL: Your letter of August 29 is received. I have telegraphed you authority to remuster the Minnesota cavalry. The Secretary of War is absent, and I cannot reply to your request that you be authorized to designate the battalion officers. I do not, however, see how such authority can be given. The law gives the appointment of such officers to the Government of States. The President can appoint only when the Governor refuses to act.

General Hurlbut is asking for re-enforcements for General Steele in Arkansas. It is very desirable that all the troops you can spare be sent down the Mississippi River as early as possible. If the rebels can be driven out of Arkansas, the guerrillas in Missouri will be comparatively quiet. They are always expecting that Price will come to their assistance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 6, 1863-3 p. m.

(Received September 10.)

Major-General HURLBUT, Memphis, Tenn.:

Communicate with General Grant, or commanding officer at Vicksburg, for re-enforcements to Steele, if they are necessary. If all Kirby Smith's forces have moved to Little Rock, so many troops are not required on the Mississippi River. Rosecrans and Burnside will occupy all of Bragg's forces. Steele's expedition must not be permitted to fail.
