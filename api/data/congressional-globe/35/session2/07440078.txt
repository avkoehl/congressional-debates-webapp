APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

35th Cong....2d Sess.
Protective and Free-Trade Tariffs Contrasted—Mr. Walton.
Ho. of Reps.
various parts of the Union during the latter part
of the preceding year, (1818,) have, during the
present, (1819,) been considerably augmented,
and still continue to exist." President Monroe :
also spoke of "the great reduction in the price of
the principal articles of domestic growth," "and
the consequent fall m the price of labor;" of "the
pecuniary embarrassments which have so deeply
affected the commercial interests of the nation,"
and " been no less adverse to our manufacturing
establishments;" of " the great reduction of the
currency, winch the banks have been constrained
to make, in order to continue specie payments,
and the vitiated character of it where such reduc-
tions have not been attempted;" and, finally, of
"the loss of individual con6dence, from the fre-
quent failures which have recently occurred in
some of our principal cities."
Of the convulsion of 1637-38, yet fresh within
the recollection of us all, 1 need only say, that
it fully rivaled that of the present era; and that
the storm, which swept commerce, manufactures,
and agriculture in 1837-38, was equaled only by
that fiery storm of popular indignation which over- j
-whelmed the mistaken politicians, whose policy i
had provoked the common luin. Let the gentle- '
men on the other side of this Hall remember the ;
holocaust of 1840. i
Why these convulsions? Why so regular in ,
occurrence,and so uniform and disastrous m their ,
consequences? The President gives us a solution
in " our present system of bank credits." The j
unanswerable objection is, that we have had the ;
same system, as well in periods of universal pros- |
penty as of universal calamity; why have we not ;
always had calamity ? Why is our banking sys- '
inn good in one period and bad in another? Again, j
the President materially varies his solution; it is ,
not in our " system" of banking, but in bad bank- i
imr; in " the speculative inflation of our currency," I
which, I admit, certainly preceded the periods of i
convulsion, but did not prevail in the intermediate
period. Tin'inevitable inquiry is: why had we
"speculative; inflations" in the periods preced-
ing ihe convulsions of 1838 and 1858, and why did
we not have I hem m the intervening period of
J81l-46? My answer is involved in the whole
theoiy of (lie cause of the convulsions of IHItf,
1*38, and ]t\r>8, which iri this: under every finan-
cial system of (lie Kedei al Government which en-
couiagcs the consumption of foreign productions,
to theexi'lusion ofdomestic, we have, as its propel
finite, in Hated expenses of the Government—ille-
gitimate banking, characterized by "speculative
lnHations;" a vast excess of imports over domestic
exports, and a consequent debt to foreign coun-
tiies, the grand result of all winch is a " convul-
sion" that depletes the Tiea.sury of i evenue, aug-
ments the national debt, and utterly blasts the
business of the count i y (hi the other hand, under
( very financial system winch encourages domes-
tic production in preference io foreign, we have

balances in (lie lot ei^n I rade, u sniih u ncy <,f i ev-
onue, and national \i\coiand pi os(>ern y, n:> the
giand results,
In this theory, the " speculative inflation of the
euncncv," chauri'd by the I'tesideut, has its
prop'-r place, as a powerful, though n  t the chief',
element of miseiiu f. It nceomp.iui"n intlat< d mi-
poifations ol loici'.cn productions and aggravates
then Kitsch)- f. because the lulls of youi banks,
t'.os'j painted vaiuMes that pay the toiling millions
of the land, ate spunnd hy their Government for
the very taxes it imposes, and spurned by tie ir
creditor's, m every laud but their own, for the
very debt winch crushes them.
Now, Air. Chairman, 1 propose to test this the-
ory by the simple lo^ic of facts, deduced almost
exclusively fiom the last icport of the Secretary
of ihe Titasury. The periods 1 have selected
are the four years following t!ie 1-i^t war with
Great Britain, and ending with the '* convulsion"
of 1818; the seven years horn J825 to 1831. both
inclusive, under the taufla cm 1^24 and ]K?S. and
immediately precedm^ tbn ledu-'^d tariff of lb32;
the period from 1S34 to 1K38, boih jik\imv< , under
the compromise act of 1833, and ending with thr*
" convulsion" of 1838; the thiec ycats, 1^14 to
1846, and all that were under the tariff of 1842,
for which the Secretary's report gives us the de-
tails;* and the eleven years, from 1848 to 1858,
both inclusive, under the low tariffs of 1846 and
1857, and ending in the "convulsion" of 1857
and 3858. I state the "average duty" in each
period; and 1 mean by it the per centage of the
revenue from customs upon the total amount of
foreign goods entered for consumption. I also
state the "consumption" and "taxation" per
head of population—meaning, by the one, the
amountof foreign goods consumed per head; and
by the other, the expenses of Government, exclu-
sive of payments on the public debt, per head of
population:

Starting with a low tariff of twenty and seven !
tenths per cent., with the consumption of foreign ■
productions amounting to$ll 88 per head,and the [
Government tax for expenses to $2 23 per head, j
(both enlarged, doubtless, by the fact that this (
period immediately succeeded the last war with j
Great Britain,) we find, in the succeeding high- 1
tariff period of thirty-five and eight tenths per
cent, consumption reduced from $11 88 to $5 09
per head, a reduction of more than fifty-seven per
cent.; and the tax reduced from $2 23 per head to
#1 0G; a reduction of over fifty-two per cent. In
the next following low-tariff period of fifteen and ;
two tenths per cent., the consumption of foreign
goods is raised fiom #5 09 per head to £7 37, an '
increase of over forty-four per cent.; and the tax ;
is raised also, from $1 06 per head to $1 79, an |
increase of nearly sixty-nine per cent. In the j
next .succeeding high-tariff period of twenty-five '
and seven tenths per cent., we find the consump- '
t j on of foreign goods reduced from $7 37 per head •
to #f> 25, a reduction of more than twenty-eight '
j percent.; and the tax upon the people reduced ;
! fiom $1 79 per head to ^l 16, a redurtiou of more j
| than thirty-five percent. In the next succeeding
: low-tan!)'period, we find the consumption of for- ;
i eign goods increased fiom >5 25 per head to $8 86,
i an increase of fiity-eight per cent.; and the Gov- |
i eminent tax mcieased fiom $1 ll> per head to ,
$1 99, an increase ofsixly-Lhieo pt-r cent. |
[ Here, sir, is an invariable lule: low tariffs in- j
■ creasing always the consumption of foreign prod- ]
nets, and the burden upon the people for the ,
I support of the Government, and taxing the peo- '
| pie heaviest at the very moment when the flood- i
tide of foreign importations is reducing to the !
1 lowest point their ability to pay. High tariffs ;
■ work precisely the opposite effects. '
The next point is illegitimate banking and .
j ''speculative inflations." Here, sir, 1 exclude '
. the two first periods, for the double reason that I !
! find no returns in the report of the Secietary of
i the Treasury, and that the calculations for the
1 purposes of comparison would be distuibed, per-
i haps, by the connection of the United States i
■ Rank with the currency of the country in those
} peuods. 1 take the last three periods, remarking
j that in the last, from 1848 to 1858, the years 1852
; and 1K33 are not included, as the report of the
■ Treasury does not give the returns: i

I1 ee\ -led all but one month of the term—the last month of
ii J o io.
$258,308,072, we find that capital reduced in the
succeeding high-tariff period to §204,604,111, and
then again increased, in the next low-tariff term, to
§288,906,338. Measuring capital by population,
we see that in the opening low-tariff period it was
$16 78 per head; that it was decreased to $10 34
in the next high-tariff term, and again increased
to $11 37 in the succeeding low-tariff term. Thus
the general results are, that low tariffs drive cap-
ital from production to banking, and high tariffs
precisely reverse the operation. But this will
appear more strikingly, indeed conclusively, if
we compare the lines of loans and discounts; and
this brings me to " the speculative inflations of
ourcurrency," to which the President exclusively
charges the great calamities that periodically
sweep the country.
In the low-tariff period of 1834-38, we start
with average loans and discounts, $421,507,360.
In the following high-tariff period (1844-46) the
amount is reduced to $288,545,783; and in the next
low-tariff period (1848-58) the amount is increased
to$448,900,955. Dividing by population, we begin
with a low tariff and $28 04 per head; then we
have a high tariff and only $14 58 per head, a re-
duction exactly of forty-eight per cent; and then
follows a low tariff with an increase from $14 58
to $19 64 per head, or thirty-four per cent.
Now, to show still more strikingly the periods
of " speculative inflation in our currency," 1 will
compare the loans and discounts with the capital
paid in. In the opening low-tariff period, the
excess of loans and discounts over capital was
$173,199,272, or sixty-seven per cent, of the
capital. Under the succeeding high tariff,"only
$83,941,671, or forty-one per cent of the capital;
and under the last low-tariff period, $209,994,909,
or seventy-two per cent, of the capital. The re-
j duction, therefore, in the excess of loans under a
| high tariff is twenty-six percent., while the in-
[ crease of excess, in the last low-tariff period, is
j thirty-one percent. Thus, perfectly and irresist-
j ibly, is if demonstrated, that the periods in which
j the country is beset with "speculative inflations
i of the currency," are precisely those when the
i tariff is low; and 1 will add, that it is precisely
i in these low-tariff periods that the people them-
selves are driven from the regular and legitimate
business of life, with the slow, but sure, accre-
tions which build up their fortunes, as the archi-
tect builds up the pile that is to challenge the as-
saults of time, into the wildest, vainest schemes
of speculation, gilded bubbles, that quickly burst
from their own expansion, and all their gold is
air.
Were it at all necessary to my purpose, I think,
sir, I might give good reasons for the prevalence
| of these excessive bank inflations, and this fatal
i fever of speculation, in the periods of low tariffs
: and excessive importations; and I will suggest
1 that it is just then that capital is forced from man-
j ufactures and other legitimate home productions
; into the banks; and just then that borrowers aie
! dnven to employ it in speculative and doubtful
j adventures, rather than in the processes of a reg-
ular and certain business. But I will stick to the
. logic of facts, and crown the demonstration of
■ this part of the subject with these: in the high-
i; tariff periods of 1825-31 and 1844-46, there were
;! no great variations from a fair average increase
;i in the revenue from the public lands; while, in
! the low-tariff period of 1834-38, the excess was
! more than forty millions; and in the last low-tariff
' period, 1848-58, notwithstanding the lavish grants
of the public lands "without money and without
price," the excess is more than fifteen millions.
; These low-tariff facts are sufficiently suggestive
■' of unproductive investments, abortive towns and
■j cities, disappointed expectations, and dividends
, | of despair.
The next point is the balance of trade exhibited

consumption with domestic exports—specie ex-
