to-day in the Chickamauga with a force to destroy all enemy's boats as low down as Decatur. Do you not think we will have to take a pontoon train along when we advance?

The Coosa, from the best information I can get, is from 300 to 400 feet in width.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Nashville, Tenn., April 12, 1864.

General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

I have a fine pontoon train all ready for you here, under good engineer officers. I will send it forward with all its equipment in time. It is large enough to bridge the Coosa twice. Thomas has a similar one. There is no enemy to your front but one of observation. Forrest acts as though he wanted to threaten our rear from the direction of West Tennessee, but your two divisions at Cairo will change his mind.

Major-General McPHERSON,

Huntsville:

Reports this morning from Whitesburg, Triana, and Somerville show no force there. The regiments of infantry that were at Mount Hope have moved to Tuscaloosa; went down the Byler road.

General Clanton has moved round to Tennessee River, to west of us. A letter from one of Roddey's men, dated April 1, in front of Dalton, says they are ordered to East Tennessee; also says there is to be a general move of the enemy.
