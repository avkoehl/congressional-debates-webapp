Brigadier -General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I would not be much surprised if a large portion of Bragg's army was going to Atlanta. Up to the 5th of August three brigades had reached there,and engineers were actively engaged in surveying. They sent a man through the lines last night to tell me that there were 40,000 men at Knoxville. I have bagged him. They dread an attack via Rome,and have but little idea of an advance on Chattanooga. A cavalry demonstration at afterward will probably find but few rebels there. I may have more positive information this evening.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
