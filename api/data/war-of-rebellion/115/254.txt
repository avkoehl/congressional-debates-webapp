Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

SIR: In answer to your telegram just now received I have to state that the writ was a very informal one, commanding me to appear before Justice J. S. Bosworth, of the U. S. superior court, at 11 a. m. on the 5th of March. The writ was brought down between 10. 30 and 11 o'clock of that day and had no attorney's names mentioned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

P. S. -This is the recollection of the officer of the day, Lieutenant Noble, Eighth Infantry, who saw the writ.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

SIR: In connection with my letter of this date I have to say that a person sent me in word that he was from the marshal's office, &amp;c. I received him and found out that it was a falsehood. I turned him over to the officer of the day, Lieutenant Noble.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
