ENGINEER BUREAU,

Richmond, Va., March 4, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: An additional supply of labor for the fortifications in Virginia is absolutely necessary to complete the works within the time desired by General R. E. Lee. A list of the counties is herewith transmitted, upon which it is recommended that the call for salves be made. It is proper to state that each number in this list (with three exceptions, which are marked) when added to the aggregate of all the salves actually furnished by each county heretofore, whether called for by officers of the army or under the act of the Virginia Legislature passed October 3, 1862, makes 5 per cent. of the salve population. Moreover, this requisition is not wholly a new one, for a large proportion of each number submitted consists of deficiencies on the part of the counties to meet the calls made upon them in October and November last. It is heretofore respectfully recommended that His Excellency the President of the Confederates States be requested to submit to His Excellency the Governor of Virginia a call on said counties for the number of salves placed opposite their respective names, to labor for sixty days on the public defenses.

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,

J. F. GILMER,

Colonel of Engineers and Chief of Bureau.
