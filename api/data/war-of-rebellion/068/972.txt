WELDON, May 7, 1864-10.30 a.m.

General S. COOPER:

General Pickett reports 3,000 enemy's cavalry having crossed Blackwater, cut wire along Norfolk railroad, marching probably on Stony Creek or this place. Am making best arrangements practicable to oppose them, but most of the cavalry of this department is still with General Hoke, whose forces will only commence arriving to-night at Kinston. Half of Wise's brigade is expected here in a few hours on its way to Petersburg. Hagood's last detachment passed here last night.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
