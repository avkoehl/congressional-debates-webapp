Major General E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Commissioner for Exchange, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have to-day received a strong appeal from the rebel agent of exchange in behalf of Mr. John F. Scott, of Fredericksburg, who, he claims, was captured while performing the office of mercy to a wounded Federal officer on the battle-field. Should this be the case, would it not be well to forward him in consideration of the release of the members of the Sanitary Commission?

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, September 14, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I inclose herewith a copy of a declaration of exchange by Mr. Ould. * May I ask you to send me such instructions as you may deem necessary in the premises?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, September 14, 1863.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: In your letter of September 7, declining to exchange General Graham for General Smith, you state that I appear to be laboring under some strange mistake; that General Smith has already been exchanged, and that I have received the equivalent. On July 14, 1863, my predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow, wrote to you, positively declining to unite with you in your declaration of exchange of July 13, and requesting you to notify the officers therein named that their exchange would not be recognized by the authorities of the United States. May I ask who was the equivalent delivered for General Smith? I now repeat to you the notification of Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow, and state that the authorities of the United States will not recognize the exchange of the above officers until united in by me.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
