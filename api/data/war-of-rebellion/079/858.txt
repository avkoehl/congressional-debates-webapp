had an interview with him, so I need say nothing in regard to his strength, force, &amp;c. The enemy's force consist of the Eighth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Tennessee, mounted regiments, numbering not less than 2,400 men for duty. They have a small regiments or battalion of Kentucky troops, say 250, also the Tenth Michigan, say 250, all mounted; then they have about 500 infantry, new troops, made up here in East Tennessee. They are commanded by Colonel Kirk, so you have their force in my front. Total, 3,400, 6 pieces of artillery. They have at Knoxville two negro regiments and one Ohio, say 350 muskets in the Ohio regiment, balance artillery of that regiment. The negroes are variously estimated from 800 to 1,800. Considerable excitement in lower East Tennessee about the movements of General Hof Chattanooga. If General William's forces had co- operated with me ane moved to join Hood down through East Tennessee, as they could have done, we could have caused the evacuation of Knoxville I feel certain. If our commissary department does their duty half, they will be able to get out many supplies. You may rest assured that I will do the very best I can for the interest of our cause in this department. Let the call your attantion to the fact that my brigade have never drawn an overcoat from the Government; not a single pistol (except 50). We are very destitute of clothing. I think I will be able to get up many shoes for my men down here, as I have procured some leather and am having them manufactured on a small scale. I feel certain you will do all you can for us, so I will not complain, and look forward for many supplied through the proper departments. I will have returns and reports made out and sent forward immediately.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier -General, Commanding in East Tennessee.
