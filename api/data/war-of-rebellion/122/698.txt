EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Albany, November 30, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge your telegraphic dispatch of the 25th instant, requesting the withdrawal of all State agents from the purchase of arms for reasons clearly stated by you.

In reply I beg to say that in view of the inability of the General Government to supply all the volunteers with arms the government of this State authorized the purchase of Enfield arms in England, some of which are still to arrive. No other purchase has been or will be made by the State.

Fully appreciating and approving of your object, which is to avoid the multiplicity of agents for accomplishing what can be better and more economically done by one, I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Albany, November 30, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War, Washington:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th instant, which I understand to be an order to discontinue the raising of volunteers in the State of New York when the last 25,000, authorized by the Secretary of War on the 6th instant, shall have been mustered into service. I will, of course, comply with the wishes of the War Department in the respect named, but I beg to add that, unless the rebellion is crushed out by the 1st of February next, I shall ask the acceptance by the Government of at least 25,000 additional volunteers from this State.

I have the honor to be, with high regard, your obedient servant,

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York.
