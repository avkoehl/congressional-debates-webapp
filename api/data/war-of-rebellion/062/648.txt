Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Have written to Washington proposing that two regiments of infantry and four of cavalry be ordered here from troops of other State, to insure impartiality in quieting local troubles. This would enable me to take about 2,000 infantry, six batteries of artillery, and 6,000 cavalry to move south, in execution of the plan of which General Ewing spoke to you. If no outside troops are sent I can still move with 4,000 or 5,000 cavalry and 1,500 infantry and five batteries.
