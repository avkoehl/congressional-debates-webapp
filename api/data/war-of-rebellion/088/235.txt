HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864-2.25 p.m.

General BIRNEY:

I send you another brigade under General Barlow to your right, where I supposed that Colonel Broady's brigade was to be sent, and I have ordered Miles' to be sent in to you as soon as possible. How soon he may come I cannot tell at this distance. I am told you have also already got a brigade of Colonel Smyth's division. We have plenty of troops, and if the commanders will hold until re-enforced, there can be no difficulty.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS, August 16, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

I propose to attack again at 5 o'clock. General Miles had formed on my right flank, covering the road leading to my rear. The enemy seem to be in strength. I have reversed their first line.

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864-5.57 p.m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Forces:

GENERAL: I advanced my skirmishers and after a reconnaissance concluded not to attack. The enemy have massed in my front and, in my opinion, even after taking the works, my force could not do more. Colonel Smyth, Second Division, reports troops and artillery passing two hours to my front. I send another flag captured this morning; four more are reported; I have not seen them. I would like a statement of prisoners and of flags turned over.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
