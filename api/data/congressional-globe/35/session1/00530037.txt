and that the quantity of new lands now liable to

the surveyed lands of any former period.

the demand for new lands has been, in part, satis-

the swamp, internal improvement, and other

It is estimated that three fourths of the sold and
located lands were taken for actual settlement.
The estimated quantities covered by railroad
giants, by the a'cts of May, June and August,
1856, and other internal improvements, as stated
in last annual report, amount to 15,680,875 acres.
CASH RECEIPTS.
For the fiscal year endinu 30tli June, 1857, the re^cip^
from the sales of the public lands amount to, i,n^J yy

Upon comparison of the foregoing with the
statistics of the last annual report, it is found
that the lands sold and located, during the five
quarters ending September 30,1857, fall short of
the quantity sold and located during the period
embraced in the last report by more than six
million acres, and that the cash receipts have
fallen off in a still larger proportion. This dim-
inution is attributable to the withdrawal of the
"extensive bodies of public lands along the lines
of the railroads, in the States and Territory to
which grants of land were made during the last
ACT OP 1847.
