Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Via Royall's:

The enemy are attacking Batteries Haskell and Simkins. You must re-enforce these points and drive the enemy off at all hazards.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 10, 1864-11 a. m.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

It has been so foggy this morning that the movements of the enemy could not be observed until lately on this island. The same lines are observed, but the strength cannot be estimated. On Dixon's Island the tents have increased. Two transports have taken troops from John's Island wharf about Legareville and passed down the river, and the same vessels, it is thought, have returned. They may have landed at Battery Island, or may have gone to Cole's Island. I have directed the lookout at Secessionville to try to find out if they land on Battery Island, Folly, or elsewhere, or go out to sea, and then whether north or south. War vessels the same in Stono, but one monitor, the one his yesterday, is now down near the Pawnee. Admiral D. is in command on the river. The 10-inch guns, which were promised to be sent yesterday morning to pontoon bridge, have not been heard of. Please hurry them up. Any news from Robertson? Troops are still collected at the wharf on John's Island.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 10, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House:

I have ordered General Robertson to send the First Georgia Regulars to you. Keep sharp lookout to-night; enemy will not be content with repulse at Simkins. Will probably try it somewhere else to-night.

Major-General.
