General S. D. LEE,

Demopolis, Ala.:

Have three regiments at Panola and Grenada (Buford's DIVISION) move south to Corinth to-morrow. Forage tax in kind is getting scarce on the road. I propose, with your permission, to leave McCulloch's brigade here and send General Chalmers with Gholsom's and Neely's brigades, near Aberdeen, to have their horses shod up and to be drilled, and where they can get corn.

General S. D. LEE:

There are about 1,000 men in my command who left the army at its reorganization in spring of 1862. Orders are here to return these men to their command. This will break up Bell's and Neely's brigades and lead to desertion. The immediate execution of orders will be productive of harm, and I ask a suspension of their surrender for sixty days. On being furnished with rolls of their names I can hereafter safely effect their return without injury to my command and detriment to the public service. As it is important, be good enough to telegraph at once to War Office and ask that the order may be suspended for the present.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Demopolis, Ala.:

GENERAL: I telegraphed you this evening, suggesting the removal of a portion of my command to Aberdeen, or that vicinity, for the purpose of drilling, shoeing, and to procure a supply of forage. I also telegraphed you to-day in regard to members of my command who are deserters or absentees from other commands. Some officers are here from infantry to identify and get their men. I have given them free access to the muster-rolls in order to get a list of men claimed, but I am firmly of the opinion that until such times as all the regiments who have absentees here can be represented and have officers present to identify their men, that any attempt on the part of the few officers now here to recover their men will result in the loss of 800 or 900 men; for, as soon as you commence arresting, the balance, anticipating a similar fate, will take to the woods with arms, equipments, and horses. If all were known and could be taken at once, it might do; but I recommend, under existing circumstances, that the delivery of any portion of these troops be suspended for at least sixty days, or until my command is at some point where it can be surrounded with infantry and the men taken, and arms, equipments, and horses retained. General Buford's DIVISION and Morton's and Rice's batteries go to Corinth to-morrow. I shall go up there myself on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning with General Hodge, and remain until the last of the week, leaving my office and headquarters here. I have three regiments at Grenada and
