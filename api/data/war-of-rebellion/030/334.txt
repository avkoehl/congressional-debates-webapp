HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, Cincinnati, Ohio, January 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

All the force that can be spared from Kentucky is to be sent to Rosecrans. One division, with some cavalry and artillery, can be taken from Central District, and you can spare, I think, a division and some cavalry, taking for this Reid's brigade and the infantry at Lebanon, with one or two other regiments from other places, and such cavalry as can be spared.

See Gilbert at once in reference to this matter, and give me your opinions. No time should be lost. I expected to have been in Louisville before this, but important business has kept me here. Acknowledge and answer. Snowing.

Major-General GRANGER, Lexington, Ky.:

Halleck says that the quiet of Kentucky can be best secured by the certain defeat of Bragg, and directs that, after securing line of railroad, and concentrating at two or three points sufficient force to put down insurrection, all available troops be sent to Rosecrans. This is the principle; but unless Rosecrans acts promptly, we run great risk of Kentucky being overrun. Under these orders, one regiment for road to Lexington, a division for Frankfort, Lexington, and C., with two regiments of cavalry and two batteries, are all we should keep, I think, and the rest of your command should be sent promptly to Rosecrans. About as much more may be sent from Boyle's district. Answer and come up to-morrow.

General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch received. Will at once communicate with Captain Pennock. If Longstreet has brought fifty-five regiments west, this Middle Tennessee will be a great battle-ground. General Wright advises
