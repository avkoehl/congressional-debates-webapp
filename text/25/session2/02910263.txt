CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                             263
Indeed, sir, they are now zealous friends of the
treaty, although, at the time of its formation, Tay-
lor and others were violently opposed to it.
There is no difficulty m regard to executing this
treaty with the intelligent portion of the Cherokee
people, except what has been produced by this
man John Ross, who claims to be principal chief
of the Cherokee people, and his pliable delegation
new here The opposing Indians, now, are igno-
rant and uninformed, and these would long since
have cheerfully yielded, and have emigrated, but
for the wicked and mischievous operations of this
man John Ross, and his immediate associates.
Since the ra'ification of the treaty, I presume
this man Ross has spent more than one-half of his
time in and about this place, under the pretence of
doing something which would abrogate or change
this treaty Unfortunately, he has been permitted
to hold too much correspondence with the Execu-
tive officers of this Government, and received too
much coustenance from members of Congress,
which has been calculated to keep up the delusion
that the treaty would not be executed without his
consent or approbation Sir, I have been inti-
mately connected with this subject I have been
in a position, m connection with the execution of
this treaty, which enables me to understand things
as they actually exist, and but for this man Ross
and his aiders and ab ttor°, these unfortunate
Cheiokees would now have been quietly enjoying
the benefits of this most liberal and beneficent
treaty at their settled homes in the West Hun-
dreds and thousands of these people are this day
passively waiting to receive the permission of Ross
to leave their present abodes and go "West. Whole
neighborhoods of the Cherokees have repeatedly
made up their minds to yield to the treaty, and
commenced making their prepara'ions accordingly,
when news would go fro.u John Ross and his asso-
ciates hete, that Ross was negotiating a new treaty,
that the present treaty was undergoing modification
or change, and the Indians urged not to yield to the
present treaty or to the advice of the agents of the
Government engaged m its execution, and thus
repeated stops have been put to emigration
The countenance given to this delusion by Con-
gressmen and those high in authority, is fraught
with the most serious evils It threatens destruc-
tion and extermination to the remnant of this once
mighty race The twenty-third of May next, now
less than two months hence, and these people, so
far as Georgia is concerned, must go, and go
quickly The citizens of Georgia hold grants
for the lands on which these Indians now re-
side in that State, and the grantees are legally
authorized by the laws of the State, as well
as the treaty, to take possession of their lands
on and after the twentj-tinrd of Miy next,
and, sir, possession they will take, and the
Indians will then truly be forced out of
house and home Georgia ?nd the Georgians
have lorg .since been accused oi having taken pos-
session ■>( all tne Indian lands, houses and homes
But, sir, this was not true, it was one of the many
slanders which his been propagated to disparage
the S ate which I have the honor to represent We
have treated tne Indians with all the kindness and
forbearance which their mtsiest required But,
sir whatever conflict may irise, after the 23d of
M iv. Ge irgia must, and will be speedily relieved
from this long-standing and vexatious perplexity
If the execution of this treaty is longer resisted,
whatever evil may ensue, the just responsibility is
chargeable to this man, Ros , and his-^associates,
and to those who encourage hi> delusive hopes,
and not to my constituents, or the authorities of the
State which I represent So far from avoiding, I
would desire the most thorough investigation ol
this treaty, its execution, and every other transac-
tion connected with the subject But, sir, I will
never consent to any investigation which shall re-
tard the execution of the treaty, so far as the remo-
val of the Indians is concerned They must go, or
evil will come of it
I have in my nossession various communica-
tions from officers and agents of the Government,
as well as other citizens, all going to sustain the
fact that the Indians will not emigrate, so long as
this man, Ross, continues to communicate  (or
causes it to be done) that he is doing, or expects to
do, something here to change the provisions of the
treaty From the beginning, nothing but the fal-
lacious hope that this treaty would not be strictly
executed, has prevented the Cherokee people from
yielding to it with great unanimity This subject
is not now within the jurisdiction of Congress, it
belongs to the Executive Government, and if this
treaty fails ot execution, to that branch of the Go-
vernment I shall charge the failure, and sh«ll use
my best exertions to prevent the interference of the
Legislature—that branch of the Government to
which I happen to be attached But all the com-
bined powers of the Federal Government cannot
abrogate or change ftps treaty, without the consent
of the States interested, and that consent will never
be obtained Honesty is said to be the best policy
at any rale, honesty is a duty Then let us not de-
ceive, but save these people, by assuring them that
the treaty will ne executed
I will forbear, as before intimated, to make the
motion to lay this memorial on the table, to afford
to other gentlemen the privilege which I have ex-
ercised myself, of submitting any remarks which
they may have to make on this subject I shall
not, however, consent to give any other duection
to this subject than that which I have suggested
Mr CLAY of Alabama said that, m order to
understand fully the meats of the memorial pre-
sented by the Senator from New Jersey, he would
lay before the Senate, and ask the reading of, cer-
tain documents which had a most important bear-
ing on the subject before them The first was a
letter from General Smith, the superintendent oí
Cherokee emigration, received at the War Depart-
ment, and dated the 8th March, by which the Se-
nate would see what he thought oí the matter He
was in possession of other documents, which he
should ask to be read, after the Senate had heard
this one
Mr SOUTHARD said he would also ask foi the
reading of the papers he had piesented, m older
that the whole subject, m relation to this matter,
might be fully understood It was not his wish,
when he presented the memorial, to excite debate,
but rather his desire that the motion should have
puisued a very different course. As metelj to
have printed the memorial and accompanying do
cuments, and to have referred the whole to the
Committee on Indian Affaus, which would, no
doubt, have leported on the subjee , and put the
matter at once to rest
Mr CLAY of Alabama replied, that und r all
the circumstances, he coald not suffer himself to be
divei ted from asking the reading of these docu-
ments, ior reasors which would be apparent to the
Senate, when they became acquainted with the
contents Having undsistood, on Saturday last,
that the Senator trom New Jersey intended to of-
fer this memorial, which amounted to little more
than tuning loose the tomahawk and scalping
knife on a portion of the peop'e he represented,
lie went on that morning to the War Depaitment,
for the purpose oí obtaining information on the
subject, and was furnished with these documents,
which he was under an obligation to return m the
course of ihe day The Senate would, therefore,
see his object m requesting that they might be im-
mediately read. He should then make a motion to
lay the whole subject on the table, in oider to pre-
vent any excitement, and put an end to any de-
lusive hopes of setting aside the treaty which
would inevitably lead to the most dangerous con-
sequences
Mr KING could not but regret that his honora-
ble colleague was not prepared to accede to the
suggestion made, and suffer this matter to rest with-
out a discussion. He knew, and every Senator
knew, fall well, that if any discussion was had heie
on the subjects treated of m this memorial, they
would create hopes m the minds of these people,
which never could be realized, while the false hopes
thus created wouift probably result in the most
serious disturbances They all knew the care, the
labor, and deliberation bestowed m the investiga-
tion of the subject, and the difficulties they had to
encounter when the treaty was ratified. It was
ratified by the solemn vote of two-thirds of this
body, and concurred in by the House of Represen-
tatives, by the passage of an appropriation bill lo
carry it into affect if then, said Mr. K. when
this treaty is about to be carried into eflect, we
create m the minds of these people, the hopes- and
fears that must result from a discussion of toe sub-
jects embraced in their memorial, you greatly in-
jure them, as well as endanger the peace and tran-
quillity of our people. The Cherokees ought to be
made to understand that this thing was settled for-
ever, that the treaty was irrevocable, that the Go-
vernment was bound to cany it into eflect, and
that they must not delude themselves with the
false hope of setting it aside
He felt for this unfortunate people as much as
any man He knew that they were delud-
ed and deceived by those of their own nation
who were fully aware that there was not the re
motest possibility of diverting the Government
fiom its solemn obligations to carry out the provi-
sions of this treaty He had received much infor-
mation on this subject irom individuals of the Che-
rokee tribe, who were every way equal, if not su-
perior, to these memorialists—honest, intelligent,
and íehgious men, and who were convinced that
the true interests of their people consisted in their
renoval to the West He had hopes that his
honorable colleague would have acceded to the
proposition that this matter should be laid on the
table without discussion, without printing, and
without reference He asked honorable Senators,
as men of understanding, of patriotism and of
humanity, to show by their vote1: to these unfortu-
nate people, that all expectation of setting aside, or
changing this treaty, must be abandoned, now and
forever
Mr CLAY of Alabama said that if his colleague
had thought proper to wait for the development of
his views, he would have seen that the very course
he intended to pursue was the one recommended by
him It was his intention, as soon as the docu-
ments were read, to move to lav the whole subject
on the table, m order to prevent any discussion en
it, and he would do this for the security not only of
his own constituents, but for the secunty of those
deluded people, the Cherokees themselves He was
in possession of information which his colleague
was not aware of, that would be sufficient to satisfy
the Senate of the propriety of putting an end at
once to any action on this subject His purpose
was to produce no excitement, to permit no refe-
rence to a committee, or give use to any agitating
discussion On the contrary, his ebject was to avoid
all this, and he thought that the leadiest way of
doing so, was to let the reading of the documents
precede his intended motion to lay the whole sub-
ject on the table, He knew as well as his colleasue
did, (hat any discussion would only tend to encou-
rage falsi hopes in the minds of these unfortunate
people, and involve that section of the country la
war, and that they would, by any such action, as
pioposed by the Senator from New Jersey, bring
about the re-enactmeat of tha scenes we had re-
cently witnessed m the Florida and Creek wars It
the Florida tieaty had been promptly carried nito
effect, as it ought to have been, without suflermg
the false hopes of remaining in the countiy,
which had arisen out oí a most unfortunate delay,
we should, in all probability, have avoided that
expensive war, and all the bloodshed that was
consequent upon it So also as to the Cieek
I war. If a competent force had been stationed
amongst them to control them, and they had been
piomptly removed, all the bloodshed and expense,
together with a destruction of private property to
an immense amount, would also hav e been a\ oided
Mr C. said as he was desired by several Senators
near him to state the contents of the documents lit
referred to, he would do so as briefly as possible,
and he hoped that ¡t would be sufficient to put
down the discussion at once, an 1 indicate distinctly
to these deluded people that there was no disposi-
tion on the part of this Government to delaj ths
execution of the treaty The superintendent stated,
what was corroborated by the three commissioners,
in their letters of the 9th January and 28th Febru-
ary last, that these people say that they are ready
to go West immediately, if they had the permis-
sion of John Ross to do so, that they are waiting
the issue of his negotiations with the Government,
