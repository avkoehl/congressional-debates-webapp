CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
* than three years from the time when the United
States Bank, estabhshed avowedly to prevent the
future recurrence of excessive local hank circula-
tion, had gone into operation An embarrassment
occasioned by the same spirit of reckless adventure
in public lands, and every thing else that could be
made the subject of speculation, which characte-
rized the money transactions of the country in 1835
and 1836 If theie are any here too young to le-
member, or who have been too indolent to acquue,
information upon that subject, it is sufficient to
point them to the impotence of the Pennsylvania
Bank of the United States, avowed by its president
within two short j ears to be stionger than its pre
d<# ssor, to ward oif such a calamity
It is true, that when its suspension w as announ
ced m May last, its pi esidmg officer informed the
country that it it had consulted its own strength,
that suspension would not have been necessan
But, if the fact was as he •stated, how much
worse was that act than it has been cliaiacteri/ed
by a distinguished individual to whom the declara-
tion was made, let an insulted and injured people
decide. If it was true, there are no terms ot con-
demnation known to human language strong
enough to express the execiation which it menu
But there ¡s another, and to my mmd, equalH
strong, or stronger, if possible, objection to the
establishment of a national bank It is the politi-
cal character assumed by the late bank, especially
when, coupled with its foreign connection" To the
employment of foreign capital, wielded by Imen-
can hands, directed by American hearts, m furthe-
rance of objects of public oi puvate enterprise, I
make no objection But I protest most solemnly
against permitting in its use the shadow of foreign
control oi direction
The late Bank of the United States was believed
to have been influenced tn its political course by
foreign stockholders, not only having no sympathy
with our political institutions, but hostile to them
If it was so—and of the fact theie can be little or
no doubt—how much closer is the connection of its
successor with foreigners, how much more powet-
ful will be their influence over it, let recent facts,
showing the establishment of its agencies m Liver-
pool and London, attest. Let me not be answered
that a national bank is advocated I am not to be
misled by such a declaration, from mv firm convic-
tion that the war upon the late and present adminis-
trations of this Government was and is waged for
the revival oí the Bank of the United States.
Having shown, a* I think, that such an mshtu
lion is not only unconstitutional, but dmgorous to
the Constitution itself, I come to the meistiies
which, m my judgment, aie best calculated to save
the country, so fat as our legislation can save it,
from future levulsion andembamssmenl, and hete
Ijtake occasion to say, that no fiee Government
can so legislate as entuelv to pievent their lecur-
rence But, befoic proceeding to considei the mea-
sures refeired to, I may be permuted to stale one
other objection to the establishment of a national
bank it-is the cleailv and strongly expíese deci-
sion of the people against it
In discussing the measuies most hkelv so to cl¡e< k
and control the local banks, as to res'ram then
issues within &afe and proper limits, I will fiisicon-
sider the proposition to leqmre all payments to the
Government to be ultimately made m the constitu-
tional com of the country, and in that only It has
been said by gentlemen opposed to this, w hat they
call innovation, that it is calcii]"ted and intended
•o deatioy tne system of ciedit upon which this
country hasrfeatbed lis piesent elevated rank among
the nation  oí the w oi Id But in «hat mannei c in
it effect such a result? Is any member of this com-
mittee piepaied to permit the debts due to the Go-
vernment to be discnaiged in n redeemable and in-
convenible pipei? II not who tin entertain a
reasonable objo-ctit n to lequnmg then paj ment, not
m promises, but money i
Whtfre would be the difiere t ce bet veen the pay-
men* of com or hank notes converlib'e into it at
the will of the ho'der, m lfsefiectupon ¡he mteiests
of the banks* If they should be alwais icadv, as
thev certainly should be, to ledeem then notcsjat the
will of the holder, what hardship can theie be m
icqumng that the Government de-   i  ha'I  js.ii
vsrt them without making it necessary that it
she uld be done by the collec mg officers of the
Government? It may be said, that as it would only
be a question of convenience between puvate indi-
vidual  and the collecting officers, that the conve-
nience of the community should always be pre-
ferred But, upon a closer examination, it will be
found, mat, even upon this point, theie is no
equality whatsoever The collecting agents of the
Government may be engaged, and in the large im-
porting cities will cettamly be almost constantly, m
receiving money for the Government, theiefote it
is much more reasonable that individuals should
convert their bank notes into specie before making
payment to Ue collef ting agents of the Govern-
ment, than that the who'e burden should fu.ll upon
these agents But, I appiehend, that to requiie
payment to ihe Go ernment in coin, in every in-
stance, will have a salutarv influence upon specie
paving banks, so called, in lestiatning imprudent
issues oí p tper bv them That no injustice would
be done either to mc'ii iduals or the banks, upon the
principle that a'l bank paper «hall be convertible
into specie, by thp adoption ol the scheme pioposed,
is (o mv mmd, as clear and conclusveas mathe-
matical demonstration could make it But we
have heard it said by the opponents of this mea-
sure, who are alike the opponents oí the lale and
present administrations, with, p^rnaps, occasional
exceptions, that by tlu> scheme we should cicate
one currency for the Government and another
for the people But how such an objectien
can be sustained I can not imagine Gen
llemen, m making it, would seen to con-
found thp present condition of bank paper
with w hat would be widely ditferent, if it possessed
the supposed conveiability, the only elemont vv hich
can entitle it to the character of money If the c pe-
ration oí the sjstem ot specie payments should be
such as to bring back the banks to the fair and pio-
per redemption oí their rotes, I would askin what se-
sential particular would the one currency differ fiom
the othei? In fact, the whole currency of the coun-
try would then consist of specie orcredits equivalent
a re ult which would do more to prevent ¡he in-
dulgence of rash and ruinous speculation, than any
other measure the Government could adopt shoit
of the entne destruction ot that system of commei-
cial credit, which, propelly controlled by prudent
foresight and economy, is so essential to the main-
tenance of our national and individual prosperity
If I have been so fortunate as to make my mean-
ing undeistood, Ithmk Ihaveshowntbatthescherne
pioposed, would establish a cuilcncy of equil
value to the Government and the people, and such
an one as w on! 1 lav the fabric ot oni prospei itv on

In the b'cu sion wb ch has taken place up in
the vanous piopositions presented by the Commit-
tee ot Wavs and Means, m conformiiv to Exe-
cutive recommendation, wehave heard much about
taking c ire of the Government, ind neglecting
the people Win I sir, is the Government' It is
but an agency constituted by the people themselves,
lor the piomotion of then own piospeiity and hap-
piness And what, 1 wculd ask, is desirtd m the
measures pioposed for relief of the G ¡vemmcnl,
but to give it th<> means of rallying out the will of
the peop'c-i To my mind, it is the idlest of all
clamois to sa>, that because we intend to place the
Government m a condition to execute the par
pose of its creation, that purpose bring to secure
the public pio*pentv and happiness, that we aie

The last Pujictlar topic uron «hie! I desire

keeping of the public revenue And what is that
mode, stripped ei all the rnjstciv and disguise
which has betn attempted to bp thioun aiound
it, by the mee sant t utcrv of exchequer banks,
Ireasuiv bank Sub-Tieasury sv stem, and all the
etceteras gent'emen have applied to it Nothing

What featute of a bank can it be possibly sup
posed to possess^ It i« not comemp'ated to autho
nzethe issue of papei of any kind as ihe mere ie-
presentative oí the money so deposited for safe-
keeping
All that is intended, beyond the payment of mo-
ney, upon properly authonzed drafts from thf
Ireasury, to the public creditors, is the occasional
transfer of it, as circumstances may requiie, from
one place to another, for the disbursements of the
Government It is not, therefore—it can not m
any sense be so considei ed—a bank of any sort
wha'cver
What, then, are the objections to iO Thai it
mU increase the patronage of the Government, bv
the inciease of p iblie officers, and the addition i!
expenditure necessarv foi their compensation,
that the monev will be unsafe in the custody oí the
public officers, and that it will open the door to the
corrupt influence of the Executive, ami may Jeal
to the establishment of an odious despotism upon
the ruins of the Constitution Ttie very decisivt
vote which has been recently given, hele and else-
whcie, on the subject of a national banu, rendéis
it unnecessary tor me to discuss its merit as a pub-
lic depository The onlv conpanson which it
is then necessarv to institute is between the sy s-
tem pursueel and a return to the empojmentol
the local banks Nor does it seem material to
cairy that comparison further than the consideia-
tion of the objections just stated to the placing the
custody of the revenue in the hands of the cullect-
tmg ofnceis of the Government So far as I have
hpard, nei one is willing to restore the revenue to
the custody of the banks upon any other principlt
than as a sppcial deposite, not to be used bv
them for any purpose, and to be paid over 10 the
orders of the Treasmy whenever it maj be required
Nor is it proposed, so tar as I have understood,
to ask the banks to perform this service w thout
just compensation What compensation, 1 would
ask, do gentlemen suppose they would require for
such seivice, including the li-ir of safely keeping
the public money'
I know but little of banking tnnsactwns, but
have little doubt the service leqmrtd would not be
performed by them for less than one pU centum
upon the money committed to their charge
Taking then, the public levenue at twenty millio s
per annum, and the cost oí its custody would be
two hundied thousand dolíais
But that I may be within the rate which must le
eonceded by every one as low enough, I will fix it
at one-hall ot one per cent and the innual ev-
pens  will be one hundied thousan 1 dollars a sum
laiger bv loity thousand dollars than the sum
estimated by the Secretar} oí the lieasury, if it shall
becummilted to the collecting agents of the Govern-
ment On thescoreofeconomy,therefore,thecalcuh-

fes fai fioi/i b'iog inoi^ascd, it will be lessened in

it would be committed, the compensation bene
made an eb,ept to them, and without it they vvoti'd
not resume the responsibility, by a President desi-
rous to establish the ¡eign of inhuence and co>-
ruption It m j be answered, that there weu d
be less danger of a coirupt use of the public mo-
ney, if phced m the keeping of the banks, than
in the hands of public officers For my part, I
can not perceive the force of such an objection
Is it said th it theie is daagei of servility on account
of dependence of public agents upon the luxci u-
tive for their offices'* Ihe question is then re-
solved into a question of money and as th^t re-
duces the objection against ihe public officers and
the bank tithe same punciple it is unwoithy of
furtliPi consideration But, it may be said
that the chances of Lxecutn e corruption w II b<
