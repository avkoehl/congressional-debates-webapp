of attacking you before General McClellan's troops can reach the Rappahannock. Be very careful that they do not outflank you. I am hurrying forward troops as rapidly as possible; but may not be able to sustain you in time beyond the Rappahannock should you be attacked by too large a force.

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 18, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

It is quite possible that the enemy, while making a demonstration lower down, may attempt to turn your position by Culpeper and Warrenton. If so, you will mass your forces on the right and give him battle. Porter's corps is expected at Aquia Creek to-night. It will move up toward Richards' Ford.

HEADQUARTERS GENERAL POPE,August 18, 1862-1.30 p. m. (Received 2 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The enemy, heavily re-enforced, is advancing on Raccoon Ford from Gordonsville, Louisa Court-House, and Hanover Junction. All the Richmond force has been thrown in this direction to turn my left. I am not able to resist it without being cut off from the direction of Fredericksburg and Manassas. I have accordingly, in compliance with your instructions, started back all my trains to pass the Rappahannock to-night. My whole command will commence to fall back to that line to-night. I shall draw down toward Fredericksburg, resting my right on the railroad.

Please advise me at once if you wish other dispositions made.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK, Commanding:

My command will march in three columns and will cross the Rappahannock at the railroad crossing, at Barnett's Ford below, and at Sulphur Springs Ford 10 miles above. I hope to be entirely across before to-morrow at 12.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 18, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Cedar Mountain, Va.:

I fully approve your move. I hope to push a part of Burnside's force to near Barnett's Ford by to-morrow night, to assist you in holding taht pass. Stand firm on that line until I can help you. Fight hard, and aid will soon come.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
