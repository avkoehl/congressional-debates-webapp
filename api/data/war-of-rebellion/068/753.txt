It is reliable that the Fifth Corps hospital has been entered by the enemy. General Rosser said do to be in command of brigade of cavalry. He left the men, attendants who had on badges took away the rest, and all the rebels who could walk. There were 270 patients left.

Men of Second and Fifth Corps and rebels who were wounded, and not yet hauled off to the rear about 2 miles at least from here. I sent out a regiment there, not knowing the distance to be so great. As the damage is done to the Fifth Corps hospital, I desire to know whether you wish the regiment to remain there in that exposed position or not. The cavalry inquired at a house where the road to Fredericksburg was.
