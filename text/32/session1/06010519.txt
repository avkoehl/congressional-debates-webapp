Oregon. He does not want to carry out the ori-
ginal oblijrationsof the law, and preserve that high
faith which we are bound to observe, in carrying
out the laws of the United States. He does not
pretend to observe it himself; he wants merely
that the troops shall be stationed upon the route.
Now what is the state of facts in regard to that
route? The War Department has troops already
upon a portion of it, for the protection of emigrants
going* there. And it is the intention to station
ch'Aonnns along that route, in the summer time,
who shall pass up and down along it, to give assist-
ance and protection to emigrants upon it.
But the main reason why the troops could not
be continued m Oregon is, that you refused the
necessary appropriations to the Quartermaster's
department—the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr.
Marshall] to the contrary notwithstanding. Last
year we had a debate upon the Quartermaster's
department. I do not propose to vindicate that
department now. That will be more appropriate
hereafter. I do not propose to vindicate its ex-
penses, or say whether they are too little or too
great. But I do say that the increased expenses
of that department entirely arise out of the pos-
sessions we have obtained upon the Pacific coast;
out of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which
you are under a solemn pledge to observe. That
treaty was made under a Democratic Administra-
tion—by Mr. Polk. By that treaty we bound our-
selves to protect the frontiers of Mexico from the
incursions of the Indians, who shall come there
for the purpose of attacks upon its inhabitants.
Have we observed its stipulations in good faith ?
Does not every gentleman know that Mexico has
claims against us for millions of dollars on account
of our neglect of its provisions? Does not every
gentlemen know, as well as the gentleman from
Texas [Mr. H^yard] himself, that the most war-
like Indians to be found anywhere in the territory
of the United States are in Texas ?
Mr. GORMAN, (interrupting.) I would like to
have the gentleman answer this question: What
has the Secretary of War done with the first, sec-
ond, and third dragoons?
Mr. EVANS. I will answer, that I do not
know what he has done with them; but as soon
as the question arises, I will find out. I am going
to stick to the question now up—the resolution
of the gentleman from Oregon—and we will
attend to the dragoons afterwards. I was speak-
ing of our obligations under the treaty of Guada-
lupe Hidalgo. I have always found this House
of Representatives particularly skillful m station- j
ing troops, and afterwards particularly skillful in I
shirking the bills. Now, sir, more warlike and t
merciless Indians are not to be found in the terri-
tory of the United Suites, than those upon the
borders of Texas and New Mexico—Indians who
do not shriak from an encounter with the Anglo-
Saxon race. We are bound by a solemn treaty
stipulation to keep them from aggressions upon
Mexico', and it was stated in this House, upon
the debate relative to the Quartermaster's depart-
ment during the last Congress, that these mounted
rifles were withdrawn for the purpose of sending
them to Texas, in order, as numerous gentlemen
said, ami myself among the number, to lessen the
expenses of the Quartermasters's department. It
was necessary that they should, be there; and we
were told that they were of no use in Oregon and
California, and that infantry could serve a ntuch
better purpose there. They were, therefore, with-
drawn and brought into the territory of Texas,
for the purpose of carrying out our obligations
under the treaty with Mexico, as well as for the
purpose of protecting the people of Texas from
Indian devastation.
I was under the impression that Mr. Polk had
withdrawn these troops, but I was mistaken as to
the mounted riflemen. I will undertake to show,
however, that Mr. Polk did withdraw troops from
the line between the western frontiers and Oregon, j
I want gentlemen to tell me how the Secretary i;
of War is to carry troops into Oregon, California, j
and along the immense line of the Gila to the \\
Pacific ocean, and between the Missouri and j,
the Rocky Mountains, with the number of men \\
now in the Army, and with the small means of jj
transportation and subsistence at his disposal? |j
It is impossible. It is in vain that you endeavor |j
to shirk the responsibility upon us. It is fh<* 'j
duty of every upright and candid legislator, at h
once to assume the responsibility that belongs to !l
his position. If the acquirement of new territory
brings upon us expenses which we have not be-
fore had, the legislator knows it is his duty to ac-
knowledge the source from which they arise, and
to pay them. The gentleman from Ohio, over
the way, [Mr. Cartter,] made a-sweeping state-
ment of the extravagant desire of the Quarter-
master, to swallow down the public money in his
insatiable maw. But he did not descend to items;
and I always observe that when gentleman cannot
descend to the items, they are apt to knosv very
little about the subject. If this gentleman is anx-
ious to know where this expenditure of $50,000,000
goes to, I will read him a few items for his satis-
faction, and point out to him the place from which
he can derive new light and information.
The gentleman left the House to the belief that
this fifty millions was alone applicable to the Army;
and what are the facts? Well, I will give some
of the extras in the Army that have sprung out
of the acquisition of the new territories. Every
candid man is aware that they have grown out of
our territorial acquisitions. They will be found
in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury of
the Second session of the Thirty-first Congress,
viz:

Statement It gives the annual expenditures from 3828 to 1841,
langing fiom $12,530,846 43 in 1828 to $25,745,776 28 in
1841, the average annual increase being $943,923 56, ex-
clusive of all expenses* of collecting the revenue, &c.
The expenditures for the four succeeding years, fiom

from the a«'gregate estimated expenditures for the year

main as the estimated ordinary expenditures, the sum of
$24,925,844 54.
* Thus it will he seen that of the aggregate expenditures,
actual and estimated, lor the seven yeat** ending on the 30th
June, 1852, amounting to $294,807,407 95, the sum of
$138,148,330 18, exclusive of $13,387,544 06, interest on
the war debt, is icquired to su-tam the faith of the Govern-
ment, pledged or implied, or au&ing m consequence of its
acts durin""a period subsequent to 30th June, 1845, and puor
to 1-t July, 1849. Some of the objects of these estimated
expenditures, by reason of the extended area of territory,
have been made eithei permanent charges upon the Treas-
iiiy or will continue for a long seiies of years, and mav be
stated as follows:
Excess of expenditures of War Department, excels of
expenditures of Navy Department, pensions, inteiest on
wai debt, territorial governments, survey of boundaiy line,
survey ot* coast of California, Indian*, judiciary,
Fmther experience will undoubtedly result in compelling
still greater expenditure- m the fulfillment of treatv stipula-
tions, andin controlling and subduing the Indians and other
lawless band- with which our newly acquired tcintories
are infested, and before theie will be that permanent emi-
gration to and settlement therein ot that class ot our citi-

Mr. DISNEY. I am very sorry to interrupt
the gentleman from Maryland, but I rise simply
! to say to the House that I apprehend this debate
' will amount practically to nothing. I had a per-
sonal interview with the Secretary of War a few
moments since, and he stated to me that it was
his intention to station mounted men upon the
