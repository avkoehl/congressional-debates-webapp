SOUTHERN REFUGEES.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have been requested to
present a memorial of the Refugee Relief Com-
mission, of Ohio, praying for an immediate ap-
pronnation by Congress of ^500,000, to be ex-
pended under the direction of the Secretary of
War, in furnishing poor white lefugecs of the
South with seed and farming implements in time
for the cultivation of the soil the coming spring;
and also to aid such as are mechanics in obtain-
ing tools, &c., for the prosecution of their em-
ployments, fur the leasons named in the memo-
rial. I desne to say, before this memorial is
referred, that similar associations have been or-
ganized in nearly all the leading cities of the Union,
and especially along the border. Thousands of
refugees from the South, belonging mostly to the
families of soldiers in our Army, are in Cincin-
nati, Louisville, St. Louis, Nashville, Memphis,
and nearly all the border cities. Tiieir suffeungs
cannot be told. I presume there are now one
hundred thousand white people who have been
driven from their homes by the fortunes of war,
many of them loyal people, who are suffering un-
told miseries in these cities; many of them en-
tirely destitute; many of them without the means
and without the capacity to earn their own liveli-
hood. They have been thrown upon the chanty
of the people of the border States, especially along
the borders of the Ohio river. In many cases pn-
vate charities have been exhausted m their ichef.
Whether, under the circumstances, Congress
ought to appropriate money for their relief or not,
I am not prepared to say; hut it seems lo me cer-
tain measures may be devised for their relief.
There is now a large quantity of land subject to
confiscation in the southern States under the laws
of Congress, which for some reason the execu-
tive officers have not yet seized or taken posses-
sion of. I can see no reason why provision should
not be made authorizing these loyal refugees to
seize and occupythis land subject to confiscation,
under the protection of law, and so as to secure
to them the benefit of the occupancy and settle-
ment laws which are common and familiar in all
the western States. It seems to me that some
measure of reliefought to be extended to these peo-
ple. It is a crying evil, which is pressing espe-
cially upon the Senators from the western States.
Perhaps, also, some provision might be made to
give them employment in the manufacture of
clothing for the Army, in the quartermaster's de-
partment, and in various other departments of the
Government. At present they are thrown upon
the charity of those who are not able to bear the
burden. They are thrown upon charitable asso-
ciations who ought certainly to have some aid
from the General Government. This condition
of things is caused by a state of war, and the ex-
pense of this relief, it seems to me, ought to be
borne in some way by the General Government
instead of by local communities and associations
organized along the border.
1 do not know to whatcommittee this memorial
ought to be refeired. I have no doubt that sim-
ilar memorials will come upon us in greatnumber
during next month. Perhaps it would be well to
refer it to the Committee on Public Lands.
Several Senators. The Committee on Agri-
culture.
Mr. SHERMAN. Well, the Committee on
Agiiculture. I do not care to whatcommittee the
reference is made. The subject is one which I
thmk demands the immediate attention of Con-
gress.
Mr. POMEROY. I am glad that the Senator
from Ohio has brought this subject to the atten-
tion of the Senate and the country. While I was
at home during the fall my attention was called to
a great number of this class of our fellow-citizens
who were suffering. Theie came into my own
State train after train of emigrants, some of them
miles in length, and on every camping ground
where they camped at night you could see places
wiiere they had to bury their dead. Their chil-
dren were sick; mcmbcis of their families were
sick. There never has been a more painful sub-
ject presented to my own mind than this subject
of the condition of the poor refugees from |Aio
States of Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee, to
some extent, who came into my own State. There
were five hundred families in one train with their
suffering children. I think this subject strongly
recommends itself to the attention of the Senate
and the country.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Will the Senator
from Ohio indicate distinctly to what committee
he wishes the memorial referred ?
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that it be referred
to the Committee on PublicLands, with the hope
that they will repoit some mode by which these
people can occupy the confiscated lands of the
leading rebels. 11 seems to me it is a matter thot
ought to receive the attention of the executive
authority without any action of Congress.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The memorial will
be so referred.
