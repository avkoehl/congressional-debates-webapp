Numbers 4. Land battery, 5.30 p. m. Struck gorge wall just above lintel of second-story window, making crater 2 by 3 feet; penetration, 2 1/2 feet. Position is shown at C on sketch of Numbers 1.

Numbers 5. Land battery, same time. Struck adjoining window at granite lintel, level of window next to Numbers 4, thus making 3 shots quite near to each other.

The firing from land battery seemed to be this afternoon with but one gun, and that with slightly reduced charges. It is argued by some that one of the Parrott guns has been burst. A shot from one of them was observed yesterday to drop far short in the marsh, and after that the Parrott ceased firing.

Respectfully submitted.

FORT SUMTER, August 17, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report for the last twenty-four hours. A working force of 450 laborers and mechanics has been employed in two reliefs, day and night, upon the defenses of this post, under my orders. The sick-list has been considerable, averaging from 20 to 30 per day. The work accomplished consists of completing, to a height of 4 feet above interior crest, two traverses on east battery; restoring and enlarging filling over west magazine rampart arches; erecting timber blindage under cover of gorge parade wall; discharging and building up 2,300 bags of sand, being all received. The level obtained in re-entrant made by west magazine counter-fort is 5 feet below parapet. is tarter also a sand-bag revetment of some 7 feet base in front of stone (loose rubble) base of west magazine counter-fort, deeming it important thus to secure the magazine at the expense even of taking bags away from the curtain. No bags to speak of have yet been built upon the eastern half of the gorge wall. The average height of revetment on western half is within 10 feet yet of parapet. In the re-entrant, and for 50 feet eastwardly, the level obtained is, as I said, within 5 feet of top of parapet. The work was somewhat interrupted by the demoralizing effects on the negroes of the brisk and damaging fire from the land Parrott batteries opened on the fort at 3.45 p. m. sustained until dark. Report on this is now preparing.

Respectfully submitted.
