The twenty-fifth amendment, the next in order,
was then read, as follows:
" For additional compensation for increasing the trans-
portation of the United States mail between New York and
Liverpool, in the Ooiims line of steamers, to twenty-six
trips per annum, at such times as shall be directed by the
Postmaster Genera?, and in conformity to his last annual
report to Congress, and his letter of the 15th of November
iast to the Seeretp.ry of the Navy, commencing said in-
creased service ot>the 1st of January, 1852, at the rate of
$33,000 pei tri<>, m lieu of the pie^ent allowance, the sum
of $236,500: Provided, That it shall be in the power of Con-
gress, at any time after the 31st day of December, 1854, to
terminate the airangement for the additional allowance
herein provided for, upon giving six months' notice."
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would state,
that there are several other provisions in this
amendment, and thinks they should be read
through, The amendment may be divided, but it
should be read through.
Mr. JONES. I suppose we might dispense
with reading the whole now, as the amendment
will be taken up by paragraphs.
The CHAIRMAN. By unanimous consent it
can be done.
No objection was made, and the further reading
of the amendment, at present, was dispensed with.
Mr. JONES. I move to amend the paragraph
read, by striking out all after the word "fifty-
two," in the ninth line, to the word ''provided,"
in the twelfth line.
Mr. Chairman, this provision for increasingthe
trips of the Collins line of mail-steamers, from
twenty to twenty-six trips per annum, and the
compensation from $19,250 to §33,000 per trip,
. being an increase of ^473,000 per annum, was
* passed by the Senate, and sent here as an amend-
ment. That amendment was referred to the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means and reported back to
this House, with a recommendation that it be
agreed to.
I am, sir, a member of that committee; and it
is not known to this House, or to the country,
who of that committee recommended a concur-
rence in this amendment.
Mr. POLK. Will the gentleman state their
names ?
Mr. JONES. X will state that I was one of the
minority who opposed that report. I am not at
liberty to state gentlemen's position in the com-
mitted room. They are upon the floor, and can
state their own position.
Mr. Chairman, it has always been my under-
standing, that when there was a Democratic party
majority m this House, as well as in the country,
that one of the cardinal features of that party
creed was, a strict construction of the Constitu-
tion of the United States; and that the powers of
this Government should be limited to clearly-ex-
pressed grants, and to those necessary to carry
into effect those grants of power—not that they
may be convenient and expedient. If I have read
the recent platform o%he Whig party, as adopted
at Baltimore, they have come upon this great
Democratic principle, and adopted it as the first
one in their creed.
Then, sir, I ask them all to point me to that
provision in the Constitution, which author-
izes the passage of this law? I ask them, in the
first place, to show me where the power is in the
Constitution to establish mail lines to transport
the mails beyond the limits of the country? I ask
them to show me the necessity for the establish-
ment of this line, in order to carry out the power
to raise and support a navy ? I ask them to show
me the power and necessity to establish this line,
in order to regulate the commerce between this
country and foreign countries? I ask them to
show me the authority and the necessity of estab-
lishing this line under the war power of the coun-
try? If they have the power under any one of
these provisions of the Constitution, I ask them
where it is ?
I have read that Constitution with care, and I
cannot myself find any authority for the estab-
lishment of such lines, and the appropriation of
money for such purposes.
Mr. Chairman, I opposed this scheme when
the bill was passed through here the last night of j
107
the session, to put this ball in motion. I voted
against the appropriation, with the provision af-
terwards inserted in the appropriation bill, to give
life, power, and vitality to this contract with Mr.
Collins, and other steam companies.
But, sir, I am no prophet, nor do I pretend to
possess the spirit of prophecy; but I do predict
that this system will go on, until it will arrest the
attention of the people of the country; and mark
me! that when it snail swell the expenditures of
this country to millions of dollars, as it assuredly
will, in my opinion, the tax-paying portion of the
country will be roused to their interest, and it will
become the issue, the great element, upon which
Congressional and Presidential elections will turn;
and when it shall come, it re^uirfes no spirit of
prophecy to tell which side will triumph in the
contest.
My five minutes have nearly expired, and I
will close my remarks by submitting estimates of
the expenditures and receipts from these lines,

Mr. GENTRY. I desire, Mr. Chairman, to
avail myself of this opportunity to acquit myself
of a duty with which I have been charged. There
are no opportunities to present petitions publicly
in the House. -1 have a petition here, signed by
some thirty or forty merchants, lawyers, and dis-
tinguished citizens of the State of Tennessee, ex-
pressive of a desire that this Collins line shall re-
ceive such patronage from Congress as may be
necessary to continue its existence and its useful-
ness. It is due to these gentlemen I should make
known their wishes in that regard. I have been re-
quested, also, by a gentleman who takes a deep
interest in the success of thisamendment of theSen-
ate, and who admits himselfto be interested in this
matter—agentleman in whose veracity 1 have great
confidence—to say, that if this appropriation be
not passed, the line must be necessarily discon-
tinued, and the company will petition Congress to
be exonerated from their contract. I should re-
gret such a result, sir; but after mature reflection
on the subject, and with every willingness to come
to the (Conclusion I ought to vote for the amefid-
ment of the Senate, I have not been able to con-
clude such would be a proper vote, and therefore
t shall vote against it.
Mr. TAYLOR. Is it in order to submit an
amendment to the amendment?
The CHAIRMAN. It is not in order.
Mr._MEADE. I propose to amend the original
amendment before the question is taken on striking
out.
The CHAIRMAN. That amendment is not
in order.
Mr. MEADE. I propose to amend }he amend-
ment of the Senate, which it is proposed to be
stricken out.
Mr. TAYLOR. That is precisely what I wish
to do.
Mr. MEADE. The Chair ruled that to be in
order this morning, not more than an hour and a
half ago, in relation to an amendment I proposed.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks such a
proposition is not in order. It is in order to move
to amend where the proposition is to strike out
the entire amendment; but not where the proposi-
tion is to strike out a portion of it. The Chair
thinks the question must now be taken on the
amendment of the gentleman from Tennessee,
[Mr. Jones.]
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. Do I un-
derstand the Chair to say it is-not within the com-
petency of the gentleman to amend the part pro-
posed to be stricken out?
The CHAIRMAN. So the Chair states in this
instance. The distinction the Chair makes is this:
If the proposition be to strike out the whole sec-
tion or subdivision, it is in order to perfect the
section or subdivision before taking the question
on striking out; but this is a motion to strike out
the amount appropriated—§10,000. To illustrate:
The Chair thinks it would not be in order to amend
that by substituting other sums before the ques-
tion is taken.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. With the permis-
sion of the House, I will withdraw that amend-
ment. It is not my intention to exclude debate
on this subject.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. I move, if it
be in order, to strike out the entire amendment, so
that debate may be stopped.
Mr. ORR. I propose to perfect the amendment
before the question is taken on striking out.
Mr. MEADE. Is the motion of the gentleman
from Georgia in order ?
The CHAIRMAN. It is in order. _
Mr. MEADE. Do I understand it is to strike
out the whole amendment of the S.enater
The CHAIRMAN. It is to strike out one
clause of the Senate amendment.
Mr. JONES. I called for the division of the
Senate's amendment. Let us take the question
on that division of the paragraph. If it be re-
jected it is the same as struck out. It is not per-
fecting or amending a paragraph if it is stricken
out. Certainly not.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks a call
for the division of the question does not supersede
a motion to strike out a portion of the amend-
ment.
Mr. OLDS. I inquire whether it be in order to
amend the motion of the gentleman from Georgia
by moving to strike out and insert?
