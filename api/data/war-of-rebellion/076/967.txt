HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Near Spring Place, August 16, 1864.

General F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.

GENERAL: Colonel Thompson destroyed railroad near Big Shanty for one mile on Friday night. Colonel Hannon, commanding brigade, destroyed the railroad near Calhoun on Saturday night, capturing 1,020 beef-cattle and a few wagons. Allan's brigade and Humes' and Kelly's division destroyed the railroad for several miles between Resaca and Tunnel Hill, and Kelly's and parts of Humes' commands captured Dalton Sunday evening with a considerable amount of stores, 3 trains of cars, and 200 fine mules. The train and part of the stores were destroyed and the remainder appropriated.

Prisoners report re-enforcements at Chattanooga, said to be part of A. J. Smith's troops. On Monday morning we were attacked by General Steedman with about 4,000 infantry, and obliged to leave dalton. Our entire loss up to this time about 30, most of them still with the command.

The most violent rains have embarrassed me very much, and made some of the roads very bad. The large force sent from Chattanooga prevented our working at the tunnel. I have several parties still working at the railroad.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Major-General.
