Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: Your telegram of the 6th instant, leaving it to my choice what command I would report to, has been received, and in view of the unprotected condition of North Mississippi and at the solicitation of the Governor of my State and many other personal friends, I have elected to remain here and report to Lieutenant-General Pemberton. He has assigned me to a district composed of the two northern tiers of counties of the State, and my command will consist of troops almost entirely unorganized and undisciplined, and I shall be greatly in need of my general staff officers, who ae now at Shelbyville, Tenn.; and since ir requires a special order to enable me to get them, I most respectfully and earnestly ask that they be ordered to me at once. They are Captain W. A. Goodman, assistant adjutant-general; Major J. M. Thompson, assistant quartermaster; Major A. G. Mills, assistant inspector-general; Lieutenant J. B. Mattison, ordnance officer.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.
