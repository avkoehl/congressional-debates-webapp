the whole amount expended by the Pay Department for pay of provost-marshals, commissioners, surgeons, and officers detailed for duty in the Bureau.

It may, therefore, be claimed that every man placed in the Army by this Bureau, over and above the 87,874 above mentioned, were placed there without expense to the Government and furthermore, that the draft itself did not cost the Nation a single dollar.

Attention is respectfully invited to the "historical report" of this branch, recently submitted,in which will be found a detailed exhibit of its affairs, together with may items of exclusively bureau interest which are of necessity omitted in so brief a statement as this.

I would not do justice to my own feelings if I were to conclude this report without acknowledging my great indebtedness to the officers and employes of this branch for their cordial and zealous assistance, or if I were to omit to bear testimony to the faithful and efficient manner in which they have invariably performed their arduous and responsible duties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. R. RATHBONE,

Captain, Twelfth Infty., and Bvt. Major, U. S. Army, and

Major and A. A. G. of Vols., in Charge Disbursing Branch.
