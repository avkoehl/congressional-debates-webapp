Colonel BOWERS:

I have several hundred prisoners in and more coming. Want a guard immediately of 200 men to take them to City Point. My people are all out in trenches on enemy's line. Have taken all their line in my front. A number of guns and perhaps 1,000 prisoners, with colors, &amp;c. Our loss not heavy.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

HUMPHREYS' STATION, April 2, 1865-9.50 a.m.

Lieutenant WARDWELL,

Is General Gibbon at the tower; if so, ask him to report to me, and say General Wright's report received at 9.30 that he wants re-enforcements to hold what he has gained.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 2, 1865-10 a.m.

General GRANT:

Is General Humphreys in the enemy's line, and will he protect my rear if I move my force in connection with Wright's toward Petersburg and try to reach the Appomattox? I have large number of prisoners in, say 1,000.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

Humphreys' Station, April 2, 1865-12 m.

Colonel BOWERS:

All my men were sent from this neighborhood to aid General Wright, who reported himself in danger of being driven back. They have followed the rebs. I remained here waiting orders from General Grant as to final disposition, but the general has gone toward Petersburg, and the Second Corps has gone out to General Sheridan, so that the nearest troops to this place are some five miles off toward Petersburg. This is the depot for Sheridan's army. There is a large amount of ammunition and supplies here; about 1,000 prisoners and no troops except about 100 men and my headquarters guard. Send up a regiment at least and at once.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., April 2, 1865.

General ORD:

Have all your prisoners been sent down? I have more marines here that I will send up to bring prisoners down if you want them. I cannot send them to-day as guards for stores. Please answer.

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
