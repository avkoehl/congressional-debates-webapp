HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 20, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel MORGAN,Headquarters Fifth Army Corps:

That ground will suit. The corps will not be relieved until after dark, so there is full time for examination.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 20, 1864 - 6 p. m. (Sent 6.15 p. m.)

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that when you withdraw tonight instead of placing your corps in reserve you move to the left of General Warren and take position in front of the enemy, extending your left as far as practicable. The object is to reach across the Weldon railroad, and finally across the Lynchburg railroad. Your right will connect with General Warren's left. General Warren has made some examinations on his left to-day. When it is ascertained what additional troops are necessary for the purpose herein indicated they will be transferred to your left.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 20, 1864 - 6.15 p. m. (Received 6.30 p. m.)

Major-General BIRNEY:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that your orders of 6 p. m. are so far modified that you will not move into position when relieved to-night, but place yourself in reserve in rear of the left of General Warren. You will be moved into position on Warren's left, as indicated in mu dispatch of 6 p. m., as soon as General Wright is relieved and is available to take position at the same time [as] yourself and on your left.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 20, 1864 - 7.40 p. m.

General MEADE:

Is it essential that my corps take position exactly in rear of General Warren's left, or will it do to mass in his rear? The ground to the left is unfavorable for moving in the night, as it is very much obstructed and requires careful examination.

D. B. BIRNEY,Major-General.
