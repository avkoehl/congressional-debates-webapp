Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Senate k, Ho. or Reps,
educated Indian promise himself in a white settle
ment> Equality he does not and cannot possess,
and the influence that is the just possession of his
qualities, in the ordinary social relations of life,
is denied him Separated from deteriorating asso-
ciations with white men, the reverse will be the
fact A fair and wide field will be open before
him, m which he can cultivate the moral and in-
tellectual virtues of the human beings around
him, and aid in elevating them to the hignest con-
dition which they are capable of reaching If
these views are correct, the reflection is pleasant
that is derived from the belief that a greater
sacrifice of feeling is not made in their removal,
than falls to the lot of our fellow-citizens, in the
numerous changes of íesidence that considera
tions of bettering their condition are daily pio-
ducmg Indeed, it cannot be admitted to be so
great, for while the white man moves West or
South, accompanied by his family only, the In
dians go by tribes, carrying with them all the
pleasures of ancient acquaintance, common hab-
its, and common interests It can scarcely be
tontended that they are more susceptible of suf
fering at the breaming- up of 1 ical associations
than we are, for apart from their condition not
iavoung the indulgence of the finer feelings, fact
proves that they sell a paitff then possessions
without reluctance, and leave then cabins and
burial places, and the mounds and monuments
which weie the object-, of then pride or affection,
foi a remote position m the «ame distnct I ir
whatever they have ceded to the United Stxtes,
they have been amply compensated I speak not
of foimer tunes, to which reference is not made,
but of hter days Hue case of the Cherokees is
a striking example of the libeiahty of the Gov-
ernment in all its blanches By the tieaty, they
had stipulated to remove west of the Mississippi
within two years from its íatification, which took
place on the 23d of May, 1830 The obligations
of the United States, State rights, and acts by
virtue of those rights, and m anticipation of
Cherokee lemoval, made a compliance with this
provision of the treaty indispensable at the time
stipulated, or as soon thereafter as it was practi
cable without harshness i o insiue it, General
Scott was dispatched to then late country, and
performed a delicate and difficult duty, embaí
rassed by circumstances ovei which theie is no
human contiol, with gieat judgment and human
ity Early in the past reason, several pnities
had been dispatched to the West,under the dueo
tion of o/hceis detailed for that duty, amounting,
as is estimated, to six thousand, of whom mustei
rolls have not yet been received at this office
The prepaiations for the lemoval of those who
remained being in piogress John Ro s,nnd othei
chiefs, in vntue of a lesolution by " the National
Committee, and Council, and People of the Chei
okee nation, in general council assembled," pro
posed to the Commanding General that the entire
business of emigration should lie confided to the
nation , that the removal should commence at
the time pieviously agreed on, to wU, when
the «ickly season had pissed away, unless some
cause, leasonable in the judgment of the General,
should intervene to pi event it that the expense
should be calculated on the basis of one wagon
and team and six nding hoises for fifteen pei
sons, and that the Cherokees should select the
physicians, and such othei attendants as might be
required, for the safe and comfortable removal of
the several detachments to then places of destina
tion This proposal was accepted, on certain
conditions, by Geneial Scott, m a communication
to the chiefs, (with an exception of such of the
tieaty making paity as might not choose to emi
grate under the direction of John Ross and his
associates ) on the 25th of July To the condi
uons prescribed they acceded on the 27th, s ípu
latmg for the months of September and October
to get all their people m motion, and transmitting
a lesolution of the Cherokee council, conferring
on them uuthonty to make the necessary arrange
ments 1 he nr p ic ition as to time was answered
by saying that the emigration must recommence
on I t Septemoei, and be com) leted on or before
the 2') li Oct bei, w th a reservation m favor of
the sick and superannuated, who might be unable
to travel by land, if the waters continued too low
for steamboat nav.gation, and with permission to
such respectab'e Cherokees as might apply for the
purpose to remove themselves on the first rise of
the rivers, although it should be after the 20 h
October An estimate was submitted by the
Cherokee chiefs on the 31st of July, which put
the cost of the removal of one thousand souls at
£65,880 General Scott intimated that this esti-
mate appeared to be too high, and requested its
reconsideration, when its reasonableness was
affirmed, a trifling but indispensable ai tide added,
and the estimate was thereupon approved Of their
disposition to conduct themselves with propriety,
there is evidence in the letter of General Scott to
yourself of 3d August, of which I herewith send
an extract Throughout their collection and
emigiation, so far as this cilice is informed, the
Cheiokees have manifested pioper temper, and
an inclination to do whatever was required, with
fewei exceptions than might have been expected
and these not of an impoitant nature It would
seem that the cost of removal, accoidmg to the In
dian estimate, is high , but as their own fond p iys
it, and it was insisted on bj then own confidential
agents, it was thought it could not be rejected
The latest advices give assuram es that the list of
the Cherokees would be on the road eaily in
Novembei It has been estimated that twelve
thousand will be removed by Tolm Ross and the
other chiefs, which, added to the number that had
emigrated previously during the yeai, believed to
be about six thousand, will give an aggregate of
eighteen thousand Cherokees who have ceased to
live east of the Mississippi during the spring, sum-
mei, and autumn It is thought that when muster
rolls of the emigrants come in, thenumbei will be
found to be somewhat larger, but at present the
above is according to the information possessed
The last annual iepoit of my predecessoi made the
number of east Cherokees fourteen thousand, but
when General Scott had collected the giea., body of
the Indians for emigiation, it was computed that
there remained, after deducting those who had
lemoved since the above iepoit was made, twelve
thousand Those emigiants leing reckoned, as
before slated, at six thousand, would make the
whole number eighteen thousand a year ago
A retrospect of the last eight months, in refer
ence to this numerous and more than oidinary en-
lightened tribe, cannot fail to be lefreslmgto
well constituted minds In and pievious to May
1 ist a large party, led by educated and intelligent
chiefs, weie dissatisfied and gloomy discontented
with the tieaty of December, 183o, disinclined to
emigration, and created by their conduct serious
apptehensions foi the consequences when the
day of lemoval should mine It did come on
the ill May but on the Is h the privilege of
wealth and strength to yield what they might
withhold was exeicised in an act of giace aid
beneficence by the executive branch of the Gov
eminent In answer to a communication from a
delegation of the Che okee nation, then in Wash
ington, the faecretaiy of War, on that day, in
fonned them that the best efforts of the United
States would be put forth to prevail on the States
inteiested in then temoval to lefram fiom piess-
ing them inconveniently, or so as to mteifeie with
their comfoitable emigiation, and that he was
quite suie thee\eition would be successful that
the Cheiokee agents should remove the nation, if
desired, and he would so instruct the geneial in
command in then countiy,and that he thought
the expense of their emigiation should be
borne by the United States He promised them
an escoit and protection while on the way west,
and that, as the sum heretofoie set apart for the
payment of reclamations of various kinds, and to
defray expenses of their removal was deemed m
a iequate for these purposes, a further appropria
tion would be asked to meet them 1 his com-
munication met the approbation of the Piesident
of the United States, who transmitted it to Con
gress, " that such measures nay be adopted as
' are requited to carry into effect the benevolent
' it teotions of the Governi lent towaids the Cher
'okee nation, and winch, it is hoped, wdl induce
' tl em to remove peaceably and contentedly to
'their new homes in  the West "    Ihe fiuit of
this message was the law of 12th June, 1838,
giving to the Cherokees the sum of $1 147,067
When it is considered that, by the treaty of De-
cembei, 1835, the sum of ¿5,000,000 was stipu-
lated to be paid them as tüe full value of their
lands, after that amount was declared by the Senate
of the United States to be an ample consideiation
for them, the spirit of this whole proceeding can-
not be too lnucn admiied The communication
to theCherokee delegation, submitted by tue Chief
Magistrate to Congiess, addressing itself to feel-
ings conespondent with tnose in which it origin-
ated, found in both lion es a íeaoy and willing
concuirence By some, the measure may be re-
garded as just, by others geneious—it perhaps
partook of both attributts If he went fuither
than naked justice could have demanded, it did not
stop short ot what liberality appio\ed Ihuswas
the foundation broadly laid foi all that has since
been constiucted upon it In compliance with his
engagement, toe Secretary, on the 23d of May,
tiansmnted to Geneial Winfield Scott a copy of
the above communication, and authorized him
' to eiter into an agieement with the agents of
the nation foi theiemoval of their people," which
pioduced the airangement w th John Ross and
othtrs, aheady refeiied to ihe natuial results
ot gianting so much to the means,to the feelings,
and wishes of the Cherokees, followed If our
acts have been geneious, they have not been ¡ess
wise and politic A iai{,e mass of men have been
conciliated, the hazaid of an eftusion of human
blood has been put by, good feeling has been pre-
served, and we have quietly and gently transposed
eighteen thousand fuends to the west bank of the
Mississippi
Ihe Pottawatomies of Indiana, the time for
whose removal, by their treaty stipulations, had
arrived foi some and approached forothers,ehowed
an indisposition to comply with then engagements
White men had settled upon the lands they had
ceded, and collisions arose that threatened the
peace of the country and the spilling of blood,
which induced the agent, to whom the direction
of then emigration was confided, on the applica-
tion of the white settlers, to call upon the Gov-
einoi of Indiana for a military foice to suppress
any outbreak that might occur Ihe Governor
authorized Geneial John Iipton to accept the
services of one hundred volunteers, who raised
them and used then services in the collection and
removal of the Pottawatomies A copy of hia
report to the Governor of Indiana is herewith
submitted By this operation, seven hundred
and sixty eight Indians are now on then way to
the West Ihere have emigiated within theyear
one hundred and fifty one Chippewas, Ottawas,
and Pottawatomies, one hundred and seventy-
seven Choctaws, four thousand one hundred and
six Cieeks, being chiefly composed of the families
of the warnois of that tube who seived in Flor-
í la, and who had left their homes prior to the
last report, but arrived west since, four thousand
six hundred Chickasaws and one thousand six
hundred and fifty-one Florida Indians, making an
aggiegateof twenty nine thousand four hundred
and filty three, wnich, added to those who had
previously occupied their new abode, makes
eighty one thousand and eighty two emigrant les-
ídents, of whom thirty one thousand three hun-
dí ed md forty-three are now subsisted at the
I expense of the United States, at a daily cost of
i $3,186 24 In the whole number of emigrants,
1 of those for the year and those living at the ex-
pense of the United States, are included the Cher
I okees and Pottawatomies, who, it is supposed,
' will have leached the end of their journey befóte
this report is piesented There yet are east or
the Mississippi twenty-six thousand six hundred
J and eighty two Indians A tabular statement,
which accompanies this communication, exhibits
in detail the foregoing facts
Information was received oi the 6th November,
from the agent employed in that service, by letter
dated at Pensacola, on the 28th October last, that
all tl e Appalachicola Indians, and thirty four
Cieeks, were embarked for the West Recent
communications are calculated to induce tne belief
that the Wmnebagoes wi 1 remove quietly in the
spring     I hey concluded a treaty at Washington
