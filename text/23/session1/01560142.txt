Mr. SPElGIli said the works more ímmedi-
diately íequired weie a Register of Debates and

The SPCAKLR said he was then informed by
the Cleik th it unsold copies were exiant of Gales

The leaoluuon was engiossed and lead a third
time
Mi KINNARD submit'ed the following reso-

Mr C4RR, from the Committee on Pnvate
Land Claims, leportetl a bill forthe relief of Rob-
eit Abbott, in behalf of himself and the other
heirs of James Abbott, deceased, which was read
twice, and commuted to the Committee of the
Whole House, and made the older of the day foi
to moiron , and the bill and report were ordeied
to be printed
An act wis read a first and second time making
an appropriation to clear harbors and rivers for
the year 1834
PENSION LAWS.
The order of the day was then declaied to be
the resolution of Mr CHILTON, to appoint a
select committee to inquire into the expediency of
■30 extending the geneial pension law as to em-
brace within itspiovisioi s thosepersons who viere
engaged in tl <, Indian vais, down to the year 1794,
ard the amendment to it by Mi Bouldiv, to ap
point a c nnmittee to inquire into the moral eff cts
of the pension s> stem upon the community, and
how far it ought to be abolished or repealed.
Mr HUBBARD, having refened to the part
which he had fken m the pension act of June,
1Q3^, as chairman of the committee which leported
the Dill, he «aid he would use his utmost endeavors
to prevent its repeal, oi to lessen its benefits fiom
a decided c mviction of the just.ee on which that
act had been founded, fiom its necessity, and the
advanttges attending its existence He never will
c jn^ent that tnose to who n the public bounty has
been 1 ono-ably and justly ext nded, who have
had ti.e evening of then days gladdened by even
this p t'ance, should be deprived of it at their time
of ut tiost need
Thegentleman fiom South Caiolma had object-
ed, not only to the pension system at laige, but to
the pension act of 1832 in particular, from its ori-
gin and injustice, tiis objection to its origin was
because it Had been passed by that Congiess which
adop'ed the modification of the taufi, oi Ameiican
system, an 1 that tbeie'bre the pension system v/as
but a lamification of the taiiff,and equally obi ox
lous This la an unjustifhble conclusion The
gentleman from Siuth Caiolma ioigets that the
sume Congiess thus lepudiated passed a bill for
therehefof the claimants of South Carolina, which i
diew very largely upon the national Treasury.
Does he consider this act also a branch of the tariff
measure, because adopted by the same Congress' [
Is thiS act also an attack (as that gentleman said i
of the pension act) upon the policy of the southern
States, and upon the bioachecl idea of sovereignty >
Bat the same gentleman [Mr  Pi\civí*dy] said
that though the bill was ostensibly for the lehef of
the ^Idlers'of the Revolution, it wasieally to swell
the power of the Federal Government     Now,
undei tne act of June, 18á2, only a limited number
of soldiers were pensioned—those chilly who
I were objects of pnvate, and should justly be ob-
jects of public, charity, those who could demon
s late a continuous set vice of i mc months at least
I hese a1 e not supposed likely to irerease exocu
tive patronage   Ihis then age virtually negatives, i
j and this, the encumstances in which they had been
¡ pi iced, for which they are thus remunerated, gives
| a s.rong denial     It lsgenerally known tl it   cqui
i sitions are most esteemed by tnose who have been
' instrumental in acquiring them     Hence it is that
those who have been lnstmrnental in acquuing or
establishing the freedom of the countiy aie not
hkely to esteem lightly their subsequent libeity,
i and having formerly spent their whole foi tuneo m
that acquisition, are not now likely to have then
feelings of independence deadened by a small pit
tance which they and  otheis consider as   justly 1
their  due,  and  not a  corruptive  boon      i'l.eir
! remembiance of their exploits is as dear to them '
as the pittance is necessaiy and just
But as to the bill promoting sectional jealousies '
by sectional ¡"¡references, or as to its mteifertng in |
any manner with the tariff system, or being any j
way incidental to it, or in the contemplation of the
committee who repoited the bill, he peremptouly I
denied.   Among the members of that committee
were some from South Carolina, and nevei did he
(Mi    II )  hear any suggestion  whatever urged j
m committee upon the^tariii,  or any  sectional
questions
He con i lers that there being more pensioners
relieved who aie residents norJi than there are
south of the Potomac, should be no feasib'e objec-
tion against the bill, when it was understood that
the wai in which those veterans had (ought was
geneial, calculated to establish independence north
and south, and therefore the remuneration should
be general as the benefits confeirtd, when it was
considered that this was a proof that more Whigs
and less Tories íesided north of the Potomac; that
theieweie more persons who peiformed public
service during the revolutionary war resident north
of the Potomac, or that mortality had been greater
among those south.            *
He spoke also concerning the numbers of per-
sons now.on the pension íoll, wh.ch was indeed
greater than had been contemp'ated by the com-
mittee who reported the bill, from the paucity of
documents relative to the subject—thuo debarring
them of authentic infoimation But the number
was net greater than jusfce requned.
He then spoke concerning the amendment of
Mr Bouloin, which he considered unjust in prin-
ciple, and unlikely to be countenanced by the
House.
Lastly, he directed his arguments against the
original íesoluaon of Mr Chilton He would not
consent to repeal the pension act of 32, but neither
would he consent to have it extended to more than
the specifications of that act warranted The pen-
sions were gianted as just debts due fiom the na-
tional Government to those who had been unpaid,
or been but paid at a percentage of twenty five,
perhaps not moie than tv elve, of what they should
have rere ved Those so pensioned ! ad embarked
the.r whole fortunes in the war, and had won the
libeity of then country, while they lost their own
means of living. The pensions were therefore a
just demand of compensation But the same ar-
guments cannot exist in any other circumstances.
These men had ac'ed befoiethees'abl^hmentof a
General Government, aU that Lavs reived "¡nee,
have been appt m'td and paid by the General Gov-
ernment, and have n H theteure th" lairie (¡aims
to utge as the sui vivois ot Lie Revolution
He admits that the Indian w r between 't?3 ai d
'95 wat, a ¡ uMie war, and ¡>so treated ¡n the pub-
ic statutes and hisiory of the countiy But the
soldieis so serving weie tdequately paid. If pen-
sions are granted to them, wneie shall they not be
extended ? lo the veterans of the last war, and
to those who may smvive any fature wai Thus
will the country lie burdened pet|ietually With.a
pension loll, incompatible with i he Constitution.
If they oveistep the soldieis of the levolutionaiy
wai, where will they stop' No man should be
pensioned for mere seivice alone
Mr POPE, of Kentucky, had the floor when
this debate was a 'journed accoidmg to the rules
of the House
Mi    SPEIGHT moved   that his  resolution
shou'd be made the order of the day, and tnat it
should beconsideied by a Committee of the Who'e
I House
I     This being agreed to, the SPEAKER, called Mr.
i CONAOR to fill the chair
I Mr SPEIGHT thenamended his resolution by
' adding, that the whole of the Register of Debates
fiom the first to the ninth volume inclusive, and
the whole of the Documentary History published,
should bepmchased for those membeis of Con-
giess who had not yet received copies of those
works.
Mi FOSTER asked the probable cost of those
books, and whether it was intended to furnish
members with vacant copies of these works.
Mi SPEIGHT did not know the cost of the
boolis
Mi FOSTER thought it rather extraordinary
that the House should be called on to pass a reso-
lution granting away a large portion ot the public
treasure, without knowing the amount. He
thought this secret appropuation highly unconsti-
tutional, and he was not persuaded the constitu-
ents of members would be content to find their
representa'ives enriching themselves by their own
votes of unknown appropnations—adding as they
pleased to their private libraries, as they had added
salanes to their duties This was indeed improv-
ing on the system of appropriation; and shortly
a civil list and other contingent expenses will be
granted wholesale, without compunction oi appa-
rent responsibility. Members seem determined
to take care of themselves during their continuance
in office. Appropriations will soon be made for
their establishments of other descriptions than
libraries. Private enrichments and emoluments
aie for the public good, because obtained by the
public bounties
Mr. SPEIGHT said, that the object of his
amendment seemed to be mistaken by the honor-
able member from Georgia. It was simply to
supply the new members with sueh books^as had
been supDlied to former members, by order of the
last Congress
Mr FOSTER considered that the resolution
would, if adopted, have the effact of leading to a
greater expenditure than was contemplated, for it
would entitle fomiei members, for years past, to
call upon the officer of the House to have their
sets completed. He asked when and where was
all this to stop' He now moved that the commit-
tee should ri3e and report, and gave notice that he
would move to refer the subject hereafter to the
Libiary Com'iiittee.
The question on his motion, that the committee
rise was put; but it appeared that there was not a
quorum voting
Mr WHITTLESEY thereupon moved that the
comm.ttee shou'd rise, andthe chairman to report
the fact to the House.
Mr POLK suggested that the House should be
counted, as he apprehended there was a quorum
present
The CHAIRMAN ascertained there was not a
quorum, upon which Mr. WHITTLESEY re-
newed his motion.
Mr FOSTER then withdrew his motion, that
the committee rise, and the amendment, submitted
by Mr. Speight, was agreed to, thereupon the
committee lose, and reponed their concurrence to
the House.
