schools.
The bureau has established and sustained
on a grand and costly scale a system of schools
for the freedmen throughout the limits of its
jurisdiction.
The following statement is taken from the
Fifth Semi-annual Report on Schools Tor the
Freedmen, by J. W. Alvord, General Super-
intendent, dated January 1, 18G8:
" Grand total: schools of all kinds, 3,084; teachers,
M92: pupils, 189,517.
"It will be seen from the above table that there
ore regularly reported 1,486 day or night school?,
with 1,744 teachers, and 81,878 pupils; 772 Sabbath-
schools, with 2,105 teachers, and 57.177 pupils: and
39 industrial schools, with 1,603 pupils.
"Twenty-five of the above are high or normal
schools.
*' There are also ' within theknowledge of the sup-
erintendents, but not regularly reported/ 3S9 day or
night schools, with 458 teachers, and 18 589 pupils;
and 39S Sabbath-schools, with 2.185 teachers, and
30,270 pupils. Schools of all kinds, 3,084; teachers,
6,492; pupils, ISO,537."
Of the whole number of schools the super-
intendent reports only one thousand as sus-
tained either in whole or in part by the freed-
men themselves.
The superintendent states the expenditures
of the bureau in this department for the last
six months as follows:
" This bureau has expended for rents, repairs, and
construction of school buildings during the hist six
months, $361,205 48; and for other educational pur-
poses during the same period, $97,201 67; making a
total of$45S,407 15.
"This amount includes the $67,208 48, as reported
by State superintendents.
"The whole amount expended for the support of
the abovo schools by all parties during the last half
year has been $571,44611.
Congress directly appropriated in I860 and
1807 $1,046,000 to thesujjporfc of these schools.
Large sums are raised in addition by local
taxes. But the bureau has not been particu- i
lar from what source the funds were derived,
and in case of need the Army funds, as usual,
afford the never-faiiing resource, as the fol-
lowing extract from the report of General Ful-
lerton, then assistant commissioner of the
freedmen's bureau in Louisiana, will show:
"In Louisiana there are one hundred and forty-
ono schools for freedmen, and attending theui are
nineteen thousand scholars. Theseschools have been
supported m whole by funds of the bureau. There
employed twelve director?, at a joint salary of
£l,2_o per month ; three special agents, at a joint sal-
ary oi*300 per month; five clerks, at a joint salary
°l Wi '2 Permonth; twelve principals, at a joint salary
ot $1,350 per month ; twenty-eight first assistants, at
a joint salary of $2,080 per month: thirty second
assistants, at a joint salary of $2,070 per month;
eighty-nine primary teachers, at a joint salary of
p,340 per month; city superintendents of New Or-
leans, at ajoint salaryof $150permonth; one acting
assistant superintendent, at a salary of $100 per
month; addedto the above are two members of the
board of examination, who received five dollars per
day while on duty, and eight janitors, who receive,
each, from ten to twenty-five dollars per month.
Ihere are also several^ officers connected with the
schools who draw salaries as officers in the military
service. The cost of conducting theso schools is now
between seventeen and twenty thousand dollars per
month." * *******
"In order, though, to support the sehools, which
were at once inaugurated, there was advanced hv the
Quartermaster's department from the 1st day of May,
1864, to the 30th day of September, 1865, $237,699 20;
ot this sum, $158,229 70 were funds raised by an assess-
ment on the corps d'Afrique, cotton crops, &c., and
$79,469 50 were quartermaster's funds proper.1'
A school tax was assessed, and the assistant
commissioner says further on ;
"Forty-two thousand dollars of this tax had been
collected, but none of this sumxoas set aside for the pur-
pose of reimbursing the Government for advances made
through the quaj-termaster's department. It was ail
paid out for freedmen's schools and other bureau
accounts."—See Hotwe Executive Document No. 70,
first session, Thirty-Ninth Congress.
transportation.
The transportation of freedmen and refugees
and the stores belonging to the bureau, and of
the large army of officers, soldiers, agents,
clerks, teachers, and other employes in its ser-
vice, all of which are moved about from place
to place at the public expense, constitutes
another heavy item of expense to the Govern-
ment.
For the fiscal year ending June 00, 18G8,
Congress appropriated, by act of March 2,
1867, for this purpose alone $800,000 ; and the
previous year, by act of July 13, 1866, Con-
gress appropriated for this purpose $1,320,000 ;
making for transportation alone in two years
the sum of $2,120,000.
resume.
From the statistics already furnished it is
readily perceived that the yearly cost of so vast
an establishment as that of the Freedmen's
Bureau must be very great. But no precise
amount will ever, nor probably can ever be
made out.
The only official estimate of the probable
expenses for any one year approximating to
any honest result is the estimate made by Gen-
eral Howard, the Commissioner of the Bureau,
for the fiscal year from January 1, I860, to
January 1, 1807. His words and figures are
as follows:
"It is estimated that the amount required for the
expenditures of the bureau for the fiscal year com-
mencing January,1866, will be $11,745,0)0. This sum
i i requisite for the following purposes:
Salaries of assistant and sub-assistant commission-
ers   $147,500
Salaries of clerks  82,800
Stationery and printing  63,000
Quarters and fuel   15,900
Clothing for distribution  1,750,000
Commissary stores  4,106,250
Mcdical department  500,000
Transportation   1,980.000
School superintendents  21,000
Sites for school houses and asylums  3,000,000
Telegraphing  18,000
This estimate is, in some particulars, much
under the actual cost, as appears from the sta-
tistics already stated. As, for example, in the
item of salaries the estimate amounting to but
$280,300, and the actual amount paid in one
year being $815,731 04, without including
the large item of pay for school teachers, hos-
pital attendants, and the army officers paid by
the Government.
But, as before stated, no accurate statement
can be made of the actual cost to the nation
of the operation^ of the Freed mWs Btfrdau."
The appropriations made by Cotrgtess afford
but a small proportion1 of the rfece'ssaty -data;.'
The War Departm-eaHi&sevfer been the unfail-
ing source of all ne&Ifht supplies for the bu-
reau outside of direct appropriations of money
by law, and the supplies so furnished being
blended with the accounts of the Army elude
calculation.
The Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bu-
reau says in his report of December, 1865: -
"From section two of the law establishing the bu-
reau, specific authority is derived for issuing certain
quartermaster's stores, such as clothing and fuel, for
the destitute. These were furnished upon my reaui-
sitw* by the orders of tho Secretary of War. -
During the war many officers of the quartermas-
* j5 department were detached as superintendents
of freedmen, accounting through their chief to tho
Quartermaster Greneral. These officers were, many
i them, transferred to me with tho public property
they had on hand."
The second Freedmen's Bureau act of July
16, 18G6, to continue in force the Freedmen's
Bureau and passed over the President's veto
continued the authority to the War Depart-
ment to assign _ military officers aad enlisted
rnen to the service of the bureau, and author-
izes the Secretary of War to issue "such med-
ical stores and other supplies and transporta-
tion, and afford such medical or other aid as
maybe needful," &c. Under this authority
what supplies besides those purchased out of
specific appropriations went to the Freedmen's
Bureau out of the Army stores of the United
States, and were purposely and inextricably
blended with the expenditures for Army pur-
poses, probably not even the private memo-
randa of Edwin M. Stanton would disclose.
But. although not charged to the bureau nor
credited to the Government in the accounts of
the bureau, they went to- swell the sum total
charged to the people for the maintenance of
a great war establishment in a period of pro-
found peace. If all could be ascertained, it
would probably be discovered that the Freed-
men's Bureau had been maintained at an
annual cost to the nation of considerably over
twelve million dollars.
bukrau to be continued.
Congress has lately passed a bill to continue
its existence. Whether it is-to become a fixed
establishment will probably depend upon the
result of the next presidential election. But
upon that election it is designed in at least ten
States to exercise a controlling influence. Its
ample treasury and its thousands of hired
agents will doubtless be used to obtain the
outward appearance of a sanction by the south-
ern people of their own degradation at the
polls. Disfranchisement, coercion, and fraud
still needed the machinery of the Freedmen's
Bureau to make them effectual. Whether,
with this potent instrumentality negro rule can
be perpetuated in the United States for the
advantage of the Republican party will depend
upon the recuperative energies, patriotism,
and common sense of the American people,
North as well as South.
funds accumulate d a no on hand.
Mr. Eliot, the chairman of the Committee
on Freedmen's Affairs, in hislate report already
referred to, states the balance of unexpended
funds in the possession of the bureau, January
1, 1868, as $7,071,925 05, under the following
heads, namely:
Balanee on hand, refugees and freedmen's
fund  $61,601 39
Balance appropriation fund 0,332,835 01
Balance retained bounty fund  35,107 48
Balance school fund  7,118 71
Balance pay, bounty, and prize-money
fund  5S5.2CB. 86
Total balance on hand January 1,1838 .$7,071,92) 07
From this it appears that notwithstanding
the enormous cost of the various establishments
connected with the Freedmen's Bureau, its
operators have contrived so to use its resources
during the administration of the War Depart-
ment by Edwin M. Stanton as to be enabled to
