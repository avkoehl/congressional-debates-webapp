General JAMES H. LANE,

Commissioner of Recruiting, Leavenworth City, Kans.:

SIR: Your letter of the 17th instant* is received, in which you state that full companies of infantry organized in Illinois and Missouri are offered to the recruiting commission to constitute a part of the regiments raised in Kansas, and make the regiments raised in Kansas, and make the inquiry whether the commission is authorized to furnish transportation for such companies from their respective States to the place of rendezvous. In reply you are informed that the commission is not authorized either to furnish transportation or to receive them. Officers in one State cannot recruit in any other, nor receive companies or squads of recruits from another State.

In reply you are directed to report the names of the officers selected to the Department. The Governor will be requested by the Department to commission them. Upon his refusal the President will issue commissions.
