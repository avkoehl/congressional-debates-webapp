wood station between Decherd and Fayetteville. I would have sent the train from here last night, so that it would have started from Decherd this a.m., but we had no engine and the track was blocked up by a wrecked train just north of Christiana. Answer if the above-mentioned arrangement will answer.

CAIRO, November 8, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Captain Fitch is at the mouth of the Cumberland with four gunboats and has been there some time, waiting for transports. The first transports went up about four days since. He will push them through. There is not water enough in the Ohio for the heavier boats.

LOUISVILLE, November 8, 1863.

General M. C. MEIGS:

The interference of General Boyle, the local commander here, with the transportation is operating to the prejudice of the public service. I ask that an order be issued forbidding his exercise of any control over the shipment of supplies not intended for his own district. Will forward by mail particulars on the subject.

Where families are eating Government rations, the general commanding desires that you give them every facility for getting farther north. Give them passes on the railroad to Nashville.
