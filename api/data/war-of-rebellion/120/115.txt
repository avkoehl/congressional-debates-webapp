Major-General WALLACE:

The Committee on the Conduct of the War will visit Annapolis to-morrow morning by the early train to take testimony in relation to the condition and treatment of our prisoners at Richmond. If not otherwise engaged I would be glad to have you meet them at the Junction and accompany them to Annapolis and render such assistance in this duty as may be in your power.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., May 5, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commissioner for Exchange, Fort Monroe, Va.:

GENERAL: By order of the Secretary of War I have directed the commanding officer at Camp Chase to forward to you Holland (or Harris H.) Taylor, a citizen prisoner, to be exchanged for Presley Janney, a citizen of Hampshire County, W. Va., now in confinement at Danville, Va.

It is stated that the exchange can be effected by Taylor if allowed to go within the Confederate lines for the purpose, and the Secretary of War authorizes you to grant him the necessary parole upon being informed that the proposition will be accepted by the rebel authorities.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 5, 1864.

Major General E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Commissioner for Exchange, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In reply to your note of yesterday I have the honor to inform you that on the 20th of April, 1864, the date of Mr. Ould's declaration of exchanges, there were counted as privates 19,814 rebel troops on parole, whose exchange he announced. On the 16th of April there were on parole, of Federal troops, 8,223 and since that time up to this date we have received 1,208, making in all of Federal troops on parole, 9,431. By declaring these exchanged the rebels will be indebted to us 10,383 men, which added to their former indebtedness gives a total of 33,596 men who have been declared exchanged by the rebel authorities for whom the Federal Government has received no equivalents.
