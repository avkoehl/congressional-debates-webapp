with which you have forwarded re-enforcements have contributed largely to the feeling of confidence inspired in our men and to break down that of the enemy.

We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central and Fredericksburg roads. I want to leave a gap in the roads north of Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have to import rails from elsewhere.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

P. S.-Even if a crossing is not effected at Hanovertown it will probably be necessary for us to move on down the Pamunkey until a crossing is effected. I think it advisable, therefore, to change our base of supplies from Port Royal to the White House. I wish you would direct this change at once, and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge there in condition for crossing troops and artillery, and leave men to hold it.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 26, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

In the Field:

Your instructions of yesterday 12 m. have been sent to General Butler and General Hunter. I hope to send you some 4,000 or 5,000 re-enforcements to Port Royal to-day and to-morrow. We are somewhat embarrassed for want of water transportation while moving Smith's command. Nothing recently from Sherman.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 26, 1864-10 a.m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Would it not be well in view of our contemplated movement to direct General Smith, at the White House, to repair and put in order for the passage of troops the railroad bridge at that point? Also, make some arrangements for the transfer of our depot from Port Royal to that place. I send you a dispatch just received.

Respectfully,

GEORGE G. MEADE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

I will direct Smith as you suggest to secure us a crossing at the railroad bridge, White House, and also have our depot moved to that place.

U. S. G.
