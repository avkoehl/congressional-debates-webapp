Captain J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg:

At 9 a.m. to-day three miles north of Tipton, Captain Gregg robbed the express and passengers. He went north. His force variously estimated from thirteen to thirty. The operator at Tipton neglected this information. Should he not be dismissed? I could have intercepted these men had I been informed this morning. I have sent men from La Mine bridge through on their trail. Nothing else new.

CAPTAIN: I have information that last evening, within four miles of the city, Confederate scouts were taking horses. This morning they have shot and wounded one Union man, robbing him of horses and other property. The deputy sheriff was taken prisoner below the city to-day. There are rumors of other depredations. Yesterday a Confederate scout of thirty-six were east of Sparta. The troops of guns were heard in different directions seven miles below this city this forenoon. Circumstances show that a force of some kind is nearing us.

Yours, &amp;c.,
