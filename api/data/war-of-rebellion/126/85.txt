During July and August, 1864, the advance of General Sherman's army gave us the remainder of the Western and Atlantic Railroad from Big Shanty, 107 miles from Chattanooga,to Atlanta, 138 miles from Chattanooga, to which place we ran early in September, 1864. Some of the roads in use at the beginning of the fiscal year were abandoned as they became useless for military operations, and others from time to time added, until the end of the year, June 30, 1865, founds us in possession and operating the following roads, viz:
