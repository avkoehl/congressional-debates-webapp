ceeds of the sale of public lands, duties on
coal, salt, tea and coffee, the income tax.
and various other items contained in the mis-
cellaneous list, to the sum of $317,889,433,
against an expenditure of $299,600,458;
leaving a balance of $17,778,975 to be ap-
plied to the sinking fund, which consists of
two items, namely, one per cent, of the pub-
lic debt, amounting to $22,895,930, and the
interest uoon the capital of the sinking fund,
$5,783,333 ; total. S28,679,263; balance of
receipts over expenditures. $10,870,288. So
that the surplus receipts, according to this
calculation, fail to pay the sinking fund by
nearly eleven million dollars. According to
this, the removal of the duties on coal, salt,
tea, and coffee is the full extent of the relief,
if we believe that the gentleman from Massa
cbusetts [Mr. Dawes] did not mean what he
said, but was only trying to call a "halt"
upon the recklessness that began to develop
itself among his fiiends, by drawing the
gloomy picture he did, and that if the state-
ment of the chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee of the Senate is correct, then we have
some basis for reduction, even according to
the showing of the friends of the most ex-
travagant administration on earth. According
to Mr. Sherman, the Treasury ought to show
the following statement:

©r?AAS ke observed that after paying
<t>o0,000,000 on the public debt, including
^payment on account of the sinking fund
and the interest on the capital thereof, there
would be $50,000,000 left ior reduction. But
'"ink it i$ clear to all that there should be
no reduction of the public debt beyond the
demands of the sinking fund. Then we are able
to increase the amount which we can reduce
taxation to ^71,000,000. Again, in the above
statement the custom receipts are placed far
below what we have a right to believe they
will actually be for the next fiscal year. It is
well known when high rates of import duties
are decreased, there is always a large increase
in ihe receipts.
The great desideratum in a sound tariff
measure is not to exceed the limits which
yield the maximum amount, of revenue. When
prohibition is _ reached, the revenue fails as
completely as if there was no duty ; and there
is no complete protection, such as its ftiends
ask, unless it excludes the foreign article.
This increase of revenues by a decrease of
the rate of customs duties is illustrated by the
following figures :
Our customs receipts were in—
1868 S164.464.599
1%9  180 048,426
  194,538,374
18'1  206,270,408
Here was an annual increase of about four-
teen million dollars per annum, notwithstand-
ing the fact that in that time duties to the ex-
tent of $200,000,000 were removed. I think
there may be added to the above sum, pro-
posed as u basis of reduction, the farther sum
of $14,000,000 as an allowance for the elas-
ticity of revenues, making the total of the
proposed reduction $85,000,000. I have not
followed the course of the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Brooks] in showing what the
expenditures of the Government ought to be.
He h as very properly shown that they ought
not to exceed $239,000,000. In his calcula-
tion he has placed the amount which is neces-
sary to comply with the demands of the pink-
ing fund_ at 318.758,480, when in fact the
amount is S28.500.000 ; so that he would
find his expenditures increased to nearly
$250,000,000.
But I will not discuss this question on any
such delusive theory that this Administration
either possesses the inclination or the ability
to reduce the expenditures of this Govern-
ment to the sum proposed by the honorable
gentleman fiom New Yoik. [Mr. Brooks.]
With our custom houses swarming with thieves
and robbers, with our internal revenue system
supporting a host of sinecures; with officers
whose salaries per diem amount to more than
the collections they make, with reckless and
extravagant appropriations on the part of
Congress, it is the wildest supposition to place
th^ expenditures of this Government at such
figures.
Having thus, as I think, found the amount
for a possible reduction, I come to my third
question: how should it be made? This is
an important question, and in answering it I
shall be guided by the following principles
which have stood the test of a century, and
have the sanction of all the great men who have
written upon the subject ot political economy;
1 am willing to go where they lead me :
First. Tlia' every one as nearly as possible
ought to contribute to the support of the
Government in proportion to his ability.
Secondly. Thar, the time and manner of pay-
ment, as well as the amount paid, ought to be
cleat- and plain to the contributor.
Thirdly. Itshould be levied atatimesnd in
a manner most convenient for the contributor
to pay it.
* Fourthly. It should take out and keep out of
the pockets of the people as little as possible
over and above what it brings into the Treas-
ury.
Fifthly. The heaviest taxes should be im-
posed ou those articles the consumption of
which is prejudicial to the interests of the peo- ,
pie. j
The correct application of these elementary
principles will aid us in settling many ques-
tions relative to taxation. Tried by these ;
rules, there are many articles taxed in the cu8-
tonus list as well as in the internal revenue
list which violate one or more of these rules.
It is apparent now that there are two minor
ities on the committee reporting the bill under
consideration, and that they have their adher-
ents on this floor. The one side is full of
eulogies on the internal system of taxation,
and denounce with irony and scorn most of
the customs duties. The other side laud the
customs duties as the perfection of legislation,
and clamor for the abolition of the entire
internal revenue system of taxation. My
principles, above laid down, allow me to fol-
low neither party. The truth lies between
these two extremes. There are proper sub-
jects of taxation in both lists which can be
brought within the rules of sound and just
legislation. The articles of tobacco, spirits,
and malt liquors should continue to pay inter-
nal taxes, for the reason that their consump-
tion cannot be said to be beneficial to the
interests ol the people, and thus are proper
subjects of taxation.
The duty on stamps furnishes a cloar rev-
enue, convenient for the Government, but not
convenient for _the people, and therefore vio-
lative of the third canon of taxation. Besides,
a stamp duty is not one well suited to the
spirit and genius of our people, and one that
they look upon with disfavor. I shall not dis-
cuss the question of the income tax, as it ex-
pires by its own limitation this year, and will,
I hope, never be renewed. So much for the
princinal articles of internal revenue duty. I
would be glad to see the whole internal revenue
system abolished by one sweep of legislative
power. The system is unpopular, undem-
ocratic. and expensive to collect. Yet, if we
intend to reduce customs duties, we cannot
entirely dispense with the internal taxes.
With a proper consolidation of the different
rates of taxes on tobacco and spirits, and such
a modification of the existing laws as will make
them more in keeping with the spirit of our
institutions, these items would yield a fair
revenue which could be cheaply collected.
In discussing the leading items in the.tariff
list, we will still keep our principles before us.
i The duty on tea and coffee have been enlo-
{ gized by all the friends of internal duties. And
| those who voted for their removal have been
j denounced with bitter invective as " protec-
! tionists," "being led by the no«e by th.e gen-
: tleman from Pennsylvania." &c.
' Mr. Chairman. 1 voted to remove those
duties, and will do so again if necessary ; I
am led by no man; I call no man master here.
The vote I gave was based upon a conscien-
tious conviction of duty.
I concede the fact that tea and coffee yield
a pure revenue. But it is violative of the
principle which requires the burdens of taxa-
| tion to be in proportion to the means of pay-
j ing the same. It is a tax upon the consump-
| tion of two articles of prime and universal
j necessity. The tax falls upon the poor man
with the same force it doesupon the millionaire,
j In fact, the burden upon the poor man is
greater. His family as a rule is larger; the
laboiing man drinks more, and having less
; variety of food than the rich man needs more.
Do not mock him by saying that tea and coffee
are luxuries with which he can dispense. You
might as well tell him that he could do with-
out bread and that he should eat, oat-meal.
The poor man regards his coffee and tea as
necessary articles of food, and I am sorry to
see that some honorable and kind-hearted gen-
tlemen have allowed their bitter feelings
against Pennsylvania iron to run away with
their judgments on a question of so much im-
portance to the poor man.
Again, the import duties on tobacco, spirits,
and wine, are proper subjects of taxation for
the same reason that applies to the articles
of domestic manufacture. They are willingly
paid, and have been favorites of taxa-tion in
all nations making any pretension to wisdom
