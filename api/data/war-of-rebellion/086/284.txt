SAINT LOUIS, October 27, 1864-10 p. m.

Brigadier-General DOUGLASS,

Mexico, Mo.:

Pleasonton fought Price at the Osage yesterday [25th], and captured Marmaduke and Brigadier-General Cabell, 10 pieces of artillery, 4 colonels, and about 2,000 prisoners. Price burned over 200 wagons, and blew up his ammunition train. Several thousand stand of arms were captured. Price has but one gun left, and that without ammunition. His army is discouraged and fleeing to Arkansas. Now catch Dorsey.

FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CARROLTON, October 27, 1864.

General CRAIG:

I have just arrived here. The last report of rebels in this county greatly overestimated their numbers. I do not think their numbers exceed 100. The information I have thus far been able to gather leads me to conclude that they have gone west. There being no other enemy in arms in the country I will move west within an hour. Will camp some ten or twelve miles west of there to-night. If your forces are pressing the 500 rebels said to be in Clay County a few days since, I may be able to co-operate with them. Unless I receive orders from you will act as circumstances may seem to indicate for a few days and then return to Chillicothe.

J. H. SHANKLIN,

Colonel, Commanding.

WESTON, October 27, 1864.

General CRAIG:

I have just arrived here. Major Pace is passing north with his command. Bushwhackers nearly all over the river. Only a few straggling to be heard off. Our scout has been very successful.

H. HILLIARD,

Major.

LA MINE BRIDGE, October 27, 1864.

Captain W. C. JONES,

Tipton:

It is reported that a band of rebels cut off from Price are making their way from the northwest, threatening Otterville or Tipton. Be on the alert and keep me posted.

CLINTON B. FISK.

LA MINE BRIDGE, October 27, 1864.

Captain W. C. JONES,

Tipton:

No troops to spare at either point. My scout just in from the northwest reports all quiet. I think the alarm causeless.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
