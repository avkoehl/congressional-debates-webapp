kept for that purpose: Provided, That both
the master and seamen assent to such set-
tlement, or the settlement has been adjusted
by the shipping commissioner; secondly, such
release so signed and attested shall operate
as a mutual discharge and settlement of all
demands for wages between the parties thereto,
on account of wages, in respect of the past
voyage or engagement; thirdly, a copy of
such release, certified under the hand and
seal of such shipping commissioner to be a
true copy, shall be given by him to any party

ginal of which it purports to be a copy;

tlement before a shipping commissioner ate
hereby required, no payment, receipt, settle-
ment, or discharge otherwise made, shall
operate as evidence of the release or satis-
faction of any claim; fifthly, upon payment
being made by a master before a shipping
commissioner, the shipping commissioner
