THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 16,
Mr BENTON rose, and said that this report
was of a nature to deserve some attention, before
it left the chamber of the Senate, and went to a
committee, from which it might not return in time
for consideration at this session It had been
ca'led for under circumstances which attracted at-
tention,and disclosed information which deserved
to be known It was called for early m May. m
the crisis of the alarm operations, and with confi-
dent assertions that the answer to the call would
prove the distress and the suffering of the country
It was confidently asserted that the Secretary of
the Treasury had over-estimated the revenues of
the year, that there would be a great falling off—
a decline—a bankruptcy, that confidence was de-
stroyed—enterprise checked—industry paralyzed
—commerce suspended1—that the direful act of
one man, in one dire order, had changed the face
of the country from a scene of unparalleled pros-
perity to a scene of unparalleled desolation ' that
the canal was a solitude, the lake a desert waste of
waters, the ocean without ships, the commercial
towns deserted, ¡>ilent, and sad, oiders for goods
countermanded, foreign purchases stopped' and
that the answer of the Secretary would pi ove all
this, in showing the falsity of his own estimates,
and the great decline in the revenue and importa-
tions of the country Such were the assertions and
predictions under which the call was made, and to
which the public attention was attracted by every
device of theatucai declamation from Jus floor
Well, the answer comes TheSecretaiy sends in
his report, with every statement called for It is
a report to make the patriot's heart rejoice' full of |
high and gratifying facts, replete with rich infor-
mation, and pregnant with evidences of national j
prosperity. How is it received—how received by
those who called for it' With downcast looks
and wordless tongues' A motion is even made to
stop the reading1 to stop the reading of such a
report1 called for under such circumstances' while
whole days are given up to reading the monot
onous,tautologous, and endless repetitions of dis-
tress memorials, the echo of our own speeches, and
the thousandth edition of the same work, without
emendation or correction' All these can be read,
and printed, too, and lauded with studied eulo-
gium, and their contents sent out to the people,
freighted upon every wind, but this official repoit
of the Secretary of the Treasury upon the state of
their own revenues, and of their own commerce,
called for by an order of the Senate, is to be
treated like an unwelcome and worthless intruder,
received without a word—not even read—slipped
out upon a motion—disposed of as the Abbe
Sieyes voted for the death of Louis the Sixteenth,
mart sans phrase ' death, without talk1 But he
(Mr B ) did not mean to suffei this report to be
despatched in this unceremonious and compendi- |
ous style It had been called for to be given to
the people, and the people should hear of it It
was not what was expected, but it is what is true, '
and what will rejoice the heart of eveiy patuot in .
America   A pit was dug for Mr Taney, the dig-
fers of the pit have fallen into it, the fault is not
is, and the sooner they clambei out, the better
for themselves The people have a light to know
the contents of this report, and know them they
shall, and if there is any man in this America
whose heart is so constructed as to grieve over the
prosperity of his country, let him prepare himself
for sorrow, for the proof is forthcoming, that
never, since our America had a place among
nations, was the prosperity of the country equal
to what it is at this day'
Mr B then requested the Secretary of the Sen-
ate to send him the report and comparative state-
ment, which being done, Mr B opened the report,
and went over the heads of it, to show that the
Secretary of the Treasury had not over-estimated
the revenue of the year, that the revenue was, in
fact, superior to the estimate, and that the im-
portations would equal, if not exceed, the highest
amount that they had ever attained
To appreciate the statements which he bhoukl
make, Mr B said it was necessary for the Senate
to recollect that the list of dutiable articles was
now greitly reduced Many articles were now fiee
of duty, which formerly paid heavy duties, many
others were reauced in duty, and the fair effect of
these abolitions and reductions would be a diminu-
tion of revenue, even without a diminution of
imports, yet the Secretary's estimate, made at the
commencement of the session, was more than
realized, and showed the giatifying spectacle of a
full and overflowing treasury, instead of theempty
one which had been predicted, and left to Congi ess
the grateful occupation of further reducing taxes,
instead of the odious task of borrowing money,
as had been so loudly anticipated for six months
past The revenue acciumg from imports in the
first quarter of the present year, was $5 34.4,540,
the payments actually made into the treasury from
tne custom houses for the same quarter was
$4,43o,386, and the payments ftom lands foi the
same time was #1 398,206 The two first months of
the second quarter weie pioducing in a full ratio to
the first quarter, and the actual amount of avalla
ble funds in the treasury on the ninth day of this
month,was ELEVEN MILLIONS TWO HUN-
DRED AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND
POUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE DOL-
LARS The two 'ast quarteis ot the year were
always most pioductive It was the time of the
largest impoitations of foreign goods which pay
most duty—tne woolens, and the season also for
the laigest sale of public lands it is well believed
that the estimate will be more largely exceeded in
those two quarters than in the two f rot, and that
the excess fur the whole year, over the estimate,
will be full two millions of dullars This(Mr B
said) was one of the evidences of public piospenty
which the report contained, and which utterly
contradicted the idea of distress aid commercial
embarrassment, which had been propagated from
this Chambei foi the 'ast six months
Mr  B  proceeded to the next evidence of com   ¡
mereial prospenty , it was in the increased impor
tations of foreign goods     These imports, judging
from the first five months, would be seven millions
more than they were two years ago, when the
Bank of the United States had seventy millions
loaned out, and they were twenty millions more
than in the time of Mr  Adams's admimsttation
At the rate they had commenced,  they  would
amount to one hundred and ten millions foi the
year     This will exceed whate/er was known to
our country     The imports, for the  time  that
President Jackson  had  seived, have  regulaily
advanced from about seventy four millions 'o one
hundred and eight millions
The following is the statement of these imports, !
from which Mr B read-
1829    ...............$74,492 527        i
1830...............70,876,920        I
1831     .........     103,191,124        j
1832........          101,029,266        I
1833                   ............108,118 311        I
Mr B said that the imports of the last year
were greater in proportion than in any previous
year, a tempoiaiy decline might reasonably have
been expected, such declines always take place
after excessive importations If it had occurred '
now, though naturally to havt been expected, tne
fact would have been trumpeted forth as the
infallible sign—the proof positive—of commercial
distress, occasioned by the fatal removal of the
deposites But, as there was no decline, but, on
the contrary, an actual increase, he must claim the
evidence for the othei side of the account, and
set it down as proof positive, that commerce is
not destroyed, and, consequently, that the re
moval of the deposites did not destroy com
merce
The next evidence of commercial prosperity
which Mi B would exhibit to the Senate, was
in the increased and increasing numbei of ship
arrivals from foieign ports The number of
arrivals for Jie month of May, in New York, was
223, exceeding by 36 those of the month of Apul,
and showing not only a great, but an increasing
activitym the commerce of thatgreat emporium__
he would not say of the United States, or even of
Forth America—but he would call it that great
emporium of the two Americas, and of the New
World, foi the goods imoorted to that place were
thence distubuted to ev=iy part of the two" Amer-
icas, from the Canadian lakes to Cape Horn
A third evidence of national prosperity, was m
the sales of the public lands Mr B had, on a
former occasion, advened to these sales, so far as
the first quartei was concerned, and had shown
that instead of falling off, as had been predicted
on this floor, the revenue from the sales of these
lands had actually doubled, and more than doubled,
what they were in the fiist quarter of 1839 The
receipts for lands for that quarter were $668,526,
for the first quarter of the present yeir thty weie
$1,398,200, being tv/o to one, and $60,000 over'
i he receipts for the tv/o first months of the second
quarter were also known, and would carry the
íevenue from lands, for the first five months of
this year, to two millions of dollars, indicating
five millions for the whole year, an enormous
amount, from which the people of the new States
ought to be, in some degree, relieved, by a íeduc-
tion in the price of lands Mr B begged, in the
most emphatic terms, to remind the Senate that at
the commencement of the session the sales of the
public lands were selected as one of the criterion 
by which the rum and desolation of the country
was to be judged It was then predicted, and the
piediction put forth with all the boldness of infal-
lible prophecy, that the removal of the deposites
would stop the sales of the public lands, that
money would disappeai, and the people have
nothing to buy with, that the produce of the earth
would rot upon the hands of the farmer These
I were the predictions and if the sales had really
declined, what a proof would immédia ely be found
in the fact to prove the truth of thepiophecy, and
the dire effects of changing the public moneys fiom
one set of banking houses to another' But there
is no decline, but a doubling of the former product,
and a fan conclusion thence deduced that the new
States, in the interior, aie as piosperous as the old
ones on the sea coast
Having proved the general  prosperity of the
country from these infallible data   flourishing rev-
enue—fiomishingcommerce—increased arrivals of
ships, and increased «wles of public lands, Mr  B
said that he was far fto-n denying tnat actual dis-
tress had existed    He had admitted the fact of that
d stress heretofore, not to the extent to which it was
I charged, but to a sufficient extent to ex"ite sympa-
| thy for the sufferers, and he had distinctly charged
the whole distress that did exist, to the Bank of
the United States, and the Senate of the United
States—to the sere wand pressure operations of the
j bank, and the alarm speeches in the Senate     He
I had made this change, and made it under a full
sense of the moral responsibility which he owed to
|  thepeople, in affirming anything from this elevated
theatie     He had, tnerefoie, given h s pioofs to
I accompany the charge, and he had now to say to
the Senate, and through the Senate to the people,
that hefound newpioof&fbi that charge m th  de-
tailed statements of the accruing revenue, which
had oeen called ioi by the Senate, and furnished
by the Secretaiy of the Treasury
I    Mi   B  said he m ist be paidoned for repeating
j his request to the Senate, to recollect how often
they hdd been told that tiade was paralyzed, that
orders foi foieign goods were countermanded, that
the importing cities were the pictur of desolation,
then ships idle   their whai ves deserted, tneir mar-
1 mers wand ring up and down     Now, (t,aid Mi
B ,) in looking over the detailed statement of the
j acciumg revenue, it was found that there was no
decline of commerce, except at places wheie the
policy and power of tne United States Bank was
I predominant'    Where that powei  or pol.cy was
Í piedominant, revenue declined, where n was not
| predominant, or the policy of the bark not exerted,
the revenue increased, and incieased fast enough
to make up the deficiency at the other places     Mr
B proceeded to venfythissta tmert by a reference
to specified places     Thus, at Philadelnhia, wheie
the bank holds its seat of empnc, the leveiue fell
off about one th.rd, it was $,797 316 for ti e fust
quarter of 1833  and only $542,498 for the first
quarter of 1834     At New York, where the bank
has not been able to get the upper hand, there wf s
an increase of moie than  $120,000, the  revenue
there for the first quarter of 1833, was $3,122,166,
for the first of 1834, it was 43,249,786    At Bos-
ton, where the bank is again predominant, the
revenue fell off about one third, at Salem (Massa-
chusetts) it fell off foUI fifths, at Baltimore, where
the bank has been defeated, there was an increase
in the revenue of more than $70,000,at Ri hmond,
the revenue was doubled, from $12 034 to }J25 810,
