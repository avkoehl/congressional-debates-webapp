I have just learned that Captain Ferguson, with seventy-five men, is on the track of Todd's guerrillas, which, he says, are reported 200 strong, and were within a mile of Waverly last night. I have made the order and he will go west when he returns.

Arrow Rock reported burnt last night. The general commanding thinks that the concentration at Lexington of more than two companies is not necessary. We must hold the country and know what is moving in it.
