tions to protect the road in that vicinity. That neighborhood has of late been infested with guerrillas and men from the rebel army who are visiting their friends, getting clothes, plundering, &amp;c. These men have of late committed depredations on the railroad, throwing trains off the track and robbing the passengers. The commanding officer will make dispositions to prevent this in future in that vicinity. He will send out parties to scour the country and dispose of the lawless ruffians who are committing the outrages spoken of. No quarter will be given these persons who have destroyed by their actions the right to be treated as prisoners of war. When a guerrilla is found on a plantation or at a habitation the fences, &c., of the farm will be destroyed, and the citizens generally will be given to understand that if they continue to harbor these villains they will be turned from their houses and sent through our lines. The regiment will select an eligible cantonment near Duffield's Station and construct quarters and shelter for men and horses. Supplies will be drawn from Duffield's Station. Let the regimental commander make proper dispositions and report them through your headquarters. Frequent reports must be made, and energy, industry, and tact exercised in the discharge of this duty. Detach the regiment without delay. Acknowledge receipt.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A freight train was thrown off the track night before last, doing no damage, except delaying other trains. It was done by a party of rebels, about thirty in number. I sent you yesterday Colonel Reno's report of his efforts to capture the party and failure, with particulars. Same party was on road again last night, but as Reno had full notice
