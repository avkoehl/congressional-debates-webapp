Major-General.

[Inclosure Numbers 1.]

SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-6 a. m.

General MEADE:

My First and Second Divisions have both been engaged. The men are very close to the enemy, under a crest, but seem unable to carry it. Birney is occupying the advanced line of works vacated by First and Second Divisions in moving to the assault. The commanders of First and Second Divisions do not think they can use more troops than their own with any great certainty of success. I shall await your orders, but express the opinion that if the first dash in an assault fails, other attempts are not apt to succeed better.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

[Inclosure Numbers 2.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 3, 1864-6.35 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Your dispatch received. You will make the attack and support it well, so that in the event of being successful, the advantage gained can be held. If unsuccessful report at once.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 3, 1864-7 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Report from Wright announce some progress. His advance occupies a line of the enemy's pits-I presume their skirmish line. He reports the Eighteenth Corps having occupied the same line, but retiring. His (Wright's) line is pushing on. No report from Smith. I sent you one from Hancock, reporting he was about attempting another assault, written before my order to him to do so had reached him. I should be glad to have your views as to the continuance of these attacks, if unsuccessful.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
