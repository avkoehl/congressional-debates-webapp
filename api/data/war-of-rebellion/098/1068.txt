CHARLESTON, January 14, 1865. The following telegram received from Major-General MeLaws, dated 6 a. m. to-day: Enemy reported in large force a few miles from the landing at Port Royal Ferry. To-night he telegraphs: I am endeavoring to e~racuate my position. Enemy are immediately in our front. They drove our cavalry so rapidly that it was with difficulty I could send artillery and infantry to impede their advance. They are now checked at Old Pocotaligo. My troops are being moved from the right toward Coosawhatchie. Should the enemy sncceed in crossing the Combahee we will have but a short line to Midway or Branch- ville. I go to the front to-morrow. W. J. HARDEE, Lieutenant- General. His Excellency President JEFFERSON DAVIS. (Copy to General B. E. Lee.) CHARLESTON, January 16, 18659 a. m. (Received 6 oclock 17th.) I returned this morning from Salkehatchie bridge, where I found McLaws, who fell back Saturday night behind that stream. He could not give me any very satisfactory information of the enemy. They appeared in front of the bridge, but not in force. My impression is they will pass up the right bank of that stream to Broxtous or Rivers Bridge, which by passing they will be in a days march of the railroad. The enemy came in heavy force from Port Royal Ferry. W. J. HARDEE, Lieutenant- General. General S. COOPER. CHARLESTON, January 17, 1865. (Received 5 oclock 18th.) Enemy Seems to be concentrating at Pocotaligo. A force reported to be moving up the Coosawliatchie. Nothing from General Wheeler to-day. W. J. HARDEE. General S. COOPER. CHARLESTON, January 18, 1865. (Received 2 oclock.) On the night of the 15th instant one of the enemys monitors was sunk by the explosion of a torpedo about 1,000 yards from Fort Sumter. It is believed that most of the crew perished. Two boats are still lashed to the monitor, and it is supposed that but one boats crew escaped. W. J. HARDEE. General S. COOPER.
