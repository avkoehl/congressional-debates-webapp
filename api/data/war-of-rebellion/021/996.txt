General H. P. BEE,

Commanding Western District, State of Texas:

SIR: The request you have made privately to me that persons accused of theft be delivered up meets with no objections on my part as long as the principle of reciprocity is observed. During the last year the Government of the Republic made a treaty of extradition with the American Union. This treaty is a law to the State of Tamaulipas, but not being recognized by the State of Texas, it was destined to remain untilled by the authorities of the Mexican frontier line. Therefore, when establishing reciprocity in the delivery of criminals, the authorities of Tamaulipas proceed in compliance with a law of the Republic. By that law every individual assumed of embezzlement, theft, cattle or horse stealing, or petty larceny of goods or property worth $20 or more, if the crime is committed in the frontier States or Territories, shall be delivered to the authorities of the place in which the offense was committed when the fact of the commission of the crime shall be proved in such a manner that according to the laws of the country where the fugitive or accuse may they would be legally arrested and tried if they had committed the crime in the latter country. These considerations decide my course.

Whenever you inform me that you will proceed against those who in the future may be accused of the offenses contained in the latter accordance the foregoing paragraph, the Mexican authorities will act in accordance thereto, it being well understood that the restriction established in the fifteenth article of the Constitution of the Republic remains in full force as to criminals who may have been in a state of slavery in your State.

Be pleased, sir, to accept therefore the assurances of my esteem and consideration.

Liberty and reform. Heroic Matamoras.

A. LOPEZ.

General H. P. BEE,

Commanding Western Sub-District of Texas:

SIR: In pursuance of the ideas expressed by me in my note dated yesterday and in the interview I had to-day with you I have the honor of inclosing the basis according to which, in my opinion, the authorities of the States of Tamaulipas and Texas should extend their good offices to each . These articles insure tranquility for both frontiers and protect them from any attempt to depredate on the honest inhabitants and their property. They re-establish confidence, and leave the law to follow its course without hinderance against the guilty. I do not doubt that these consideration will induce you to accept the said basis as the rule which shall govern the relations of the two frontiers.

Please accept the considerations of my esteem.

Liberty and reform. Heroic Matamoras.

A. LOPEZ.
