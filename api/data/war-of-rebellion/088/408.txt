If the enemy have possession of Reams' Station the commanding general directs that you move with your cavalry and drive them from it, in co-operation with the division of infantry of the Second Corps now on the railroad. You will, of course, at once send sufficient cavalry to the station to ascertain whether it is held in any force by the enemy. The operation of destroying the railroad will be continued as long as it is practicable for a day or two.
