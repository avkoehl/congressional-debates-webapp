PETERSBURG, May 7, 1864.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Communication between this point and Weldon interrupted. Have sent an engine down toward Stony Creek to inspect it. Also direct line to Richmond cut. Up to this timek there has arrived from the south only Hagood's brigade and one light battery. I cannot account for the delay. Have sent pickets out toward Wakefield. On every road the enemy are attacking Port Walthall Junction in heavy force. I have sent the last man I can spare. The line of railroad may be cut between here and Weldon, and more delay in getting on troops. Had you not better send more troops to junction from Richmond?

Major-General.

General Bushrod Johnson reports 300 killed and wounded. Cant' you communicate with General Beauregard?

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Enemy made a very determined attack on Port Walthall Junction this after [noon] and were repulsed. In accordance with General Beauregard's order, I have instructed the commanding officer not to bring on a general engagmeent, and to fall back to the line of Swift Creek, which is defensible. Communication cut between here and Weldon, so I cannot tell whether any more troops will be on for some time. Nothing from Beauregard since 12 m. to-day. We have lost some valuable officers. Please communicate me and Weldon, and say whether you can telegraph Beauregard. I have tried by way of Greensborough, N. C. It is now 8 p. m.
