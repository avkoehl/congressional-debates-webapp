P. McCALLUM,

Superintendent Railroad, Alexandria:

At 1 o'clock this morning General Augur telegraphed me that the railroad pickets were driven in about four miles from Alexandria. I sent a company of cavalry from Fairfax Station along the railroad to Springfield Station, which has just returned, reporting everything all right. I recommend that a locomotive and guard be sent ahead of the regular train to Springfield Station to see that the track is all right, as some of the guerrilla devils may have displaced some of the rails last night.

W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

General AUGUR:

I sent a company of cavalry last night from Fairfax Station along the railroad to Springfield Station; also an officer and twenty men from his post to Annandale, thence to Falls Church, and back. All have just returned, and report no intelligence of any enemy. I telegraphed to the railroad superintendent to have the track examined from Alexandria to Springfield Station ahead of the regular train this morning and see that none of the rails were displaced.
