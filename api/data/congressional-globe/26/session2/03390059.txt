land distribution bill—a bill for years before the
Senate, and often recommended by State L°gisla
tares. He is astonished at this denuncia'i n, a-d
these epithet , but has woolly failed to understand
why I used them 1 endeavored to make mye'f
intelligible on this pom', and therefore rire'i parti-
cularly upon the chronology of his movement
Bad ard indefensible as the distribution o the land
revenue was at all times—unconstitutional ard
mischievous as such a measure must forever b<>—it
seemed to me to be «tamped w un peculiar enormi
ty at the present time, and'n the present circum-
stances of the Treasury In wa>> m respect to this
time, and these circumstances, that I felt myself
called upon to speak, and to speak m language
which the Senator qualifies, perhaps very truly, as
violent, unexpected, and uncalled for by the occa-
sion He understands me as directing all thu vio-
lence agamst the mearare it'elf, no part of it as
being induced by the timo and circums anees under
which it is moved. Yet, up n these lattT points,
I intended to be full and pointed—explicit and em-
phatic, and upon these pints I expected to heal
from him, I expected to hear from him on
the pomtof bringing ferwardadis ribu ion of the land
revenue at a urn* when the Treasury needed every
dollar of the money, and when, if 'he abst'ac ion
should be made, an immediate resort must be had to
loans or taxes to fill the chasm thus made in 'he
pub! c income I evpeeted to be vnderotood on
these point —«o be r pVd to upon them—and the
denunciation shown to be unfounded, if unfounded
it was, which qualified th s condu t as a naked,
flagrant, breach of the Constitution ' as much as >f
we levied taxc , oi borrowed money, in the first in-
stance, and by name, to be distributed among the
Stales I considered this condnc' as flagranily un-
constitutional—as admitting of no argument—as
being an exercise of our rei enne-raisi°g power, no'
for the Union, but for the State,—not to support
the Federal Government, or to pny its debe, but to
support the State Govcrrments, aid to pay ih ir
debts I relied upon the time and cixumstances
to give this flagrant charac ei to the pre'ent move-
ment in favor oí the land bill, and upon these
points I wished to be understood, and to have an an-
swer The Senator has not answered roe I pre-
sume he has not understood rae—th¡>t I have not
b°en able to make myself intelligible to him, oihe -
wise he could not have been so entirely silent on
the mam points, while so profuse of answers on
small ones
The Senator lias been dead si ent upon thechirge
of flagrant unconstitutionality in creating a defi-
ciency of revenue by distribution, for the purpose
of supplying it by taxation He has not denied
but that it is equivalent to an orig nal imposition of
taxes for the purpose of distribution He has nei-
ther answeied tbis charge nor denied this proposi-
tion Nor has he dene another thing which I called
upon him to do he has not tcld us m what man-
ner he would have the deficiency upplied—whethei
by loans, or taxes, or issues of Treasury noies
Ttv gentleman shakes his head at this last alterna-
tive, he ¡seems to eschew the Treasury no es If
so, we shall be together at that point, for a Trea
sury note issue is to me worse than loans or taxes
The gentleman would not tell his resource—whe-
ther to borrow or to lay duties, but, without the be-
nefit of a declaration from him, I bell' ve I am suf-
ficiently acquainted with his alternative I believe
I can name it for him I th nk I have heard enough
upon this floor to be able to name it It i a tax
upon luxuries—upon silks and wres—«p n French
silks and Fiencb. wines—which ¡> intended to sup
p y the place of the Uní revenu  This is the re-
sort and tne resource He hopes to make his tax
palatable by lajmg it en luxune But 1 t me say
to the Senator, that, in point of unconstitutionality,
there is no difference between taxes on luxuri   ind
on necessaries. The point of expediency is op n
between them, but in constitutional authority there
is no difference It is just a  unconstitutional to
lay taxes upon silks and wu es, for tt-e ¡>ake of
raising revenue for the S .'tes, as it would be to
raise the same revenue b\ a tax on sugar and salt
As to the expediency of doing <o, that iv ano'her
question. \\ hen revenue i1- needed for a constitu-
tional object, a luxury pr sent": i'self as a proper
sa'iject for taxst'on, but when it is not needed, a
tax upon any thing is unconstitutional As to
French wines and Frerch silks, a systematic
effort has been going on fo- some time to
have them taxed To any one who will
look at the table of the imponation of these
articles for a few years past, a reason may be seen
for the effoits whi-h are mide out of doors to sub-
j ct them to futurp duty The importations have
been immense—sufficient to supply the c untry for
two or three years to come, and the effect of a
tax would be to enrich present holders, not to re-
plenish the Treasury Pre ent holders of silks
and wines would add the duty to the price of the
articles imported fne of dutj, new importers could
not contend with them, for they m ght be under-
sold, and ruined, and thus a tax upon silks and
wines, wh'l' ennching rdividuals who have b°en
accumulating these articles, wouli add but little fir
some tim" to the Tr°asuiy receipts The only
eff' ct would be to enrich individual", and injure
commerce, without material immediate benefit to
the Treasury Th  importations v oukl be diminish
ed until the prisent s ocks were sold off, this dimi
nution would be an injury to commerce and navi-
gation—an injury o South"m comwerc^and to
NorAern navigation In  injury would fall upon
the South and West—upon Southern and Western
cotton and lobacco Large quantit es of these ar-
tii les 5,0 to Trance Nine pounds out of ten of the
foreign cotton which -he consumes, and four
pounds out of five of the fo eign tobacco which she
uses, go from the United State , and how does she
pay for tnem? Like other pations—ir her pro-
ducts, and thfoe products are chiefly silks and
wines Dimin sh the import of th-se silks and
wines, and you diminish the export of cotton and
tobacco, and besides dry up, or lessen one of the
sources for obtaining pec e I\r thee sji's and
wlr,B=) received in return for tobacco and cotton,
are man oí t^em r p - "d from this country—cii
ried to (orei?n countues—to the West Indies,
Mexico, South America—there to he exchanged
foi specie, or valuable productions, and thus be-
com  the means of supplying us wiih money, while
givng do iblo employment to cur navigation
rVr B aid it was an easy business to lay taj.es,
i  required but lade capacity, ot knowledge, or
nought, to draw up an act to lay so much pc
centum on the importation of a foreign article, but
there was omething else which na- not quite so
ea«-y—which required judgment, knowledge,
thought It was to trace the uo-kmgs of that lis
through its multiplied consequ nces—through its
effects on agriculture, on commerc  on navigation,
and on the present pursuits of individuals I do
not profess to be able so to trace the operation of
our taxes, but I can say tint I have the unnuil
document oí our commerce and navigation fo-
twenty years back—that I keep it at my room in
this city—and that not for how, but for use I
siudy it from time to time, ai d endeavor to folio™ ,
and to understand, the vast subject of our foreign
coTimwe, its connect on and dtptndenc on a~r -
culture, ind the effect of le  s ation u  relation to
it, and I am now ready o say, th?t let Uns ques
Ina of taxing silks aid wines—French =dksanl
French wines—(for these are the kinds often men
inntd, and alv/ays intended,) let this question
come when it may I 'ball hola myself ready to
prove a lax on silks and wm s to be a tix on
Southern and Western product on"—on Southern
and Westt i n agriculture—on Southern and Western
cot on ai d tobacco All that I have to say at this time
is, that it this tax is to be laid for a necessary and a
constitutional purpose, the peop'° of the South and
the West will be ready to pay it, but if proposed to
be laid for an unconstitutional and unnece- ary pur-
pose—for the purpose of rais ng mon-y, either di-
rectly or indirectly, to be given to the States, and
chiefly to the States which raise no cotton or tobic-
oo—then I say that they ooght to irstst the propo-
se on—ought to oppose the rix b\ the united v< ic
of iheir delegation  m Congress and should sum-
mon their brethien in every ptrt of the Union to
d si*t from a measure fraught with ruin to fre
Constitution, an i injury to  h« one half of the
Union.
The Senator from Kentucky [Mi, Crittenden]
i-, pleased to remember an expression which I used
some days ago, and which was only a repetition of
what I said four years ago, when the di inbutton of
public money among the States was first proposed
in this chamber He remarked upi n ray expres-
sion that if the States once began to lap that blow!,
they would, in the end, prefer it to all other food,
and suck it until the last drop was drawn away.
I certainly said it, and not merely a few days ago,
but four years ago. I u*ed the metaphor, coarse,
but strrng,and I used words in their literal sense at
the same time. I said if the States once began tb
rieeive supplies of money from the Federal Trea-
s ny, they would go on to supply themselves from
that source, until the Federal Governmert was
stripped of its property and its money, and left m
the help'ess and defenceless condition of the old
Confcdei \tion, dependent upon the States for its
'upport, and destined to die of inanition I said
then tliAt tne deposite with the S ates was a distri-
bution—that not a dollar of it would ever come
back to the Federal Treasury—hat from dividing
surplus revenue, we should coaie to Ihe division ot
that which was net surplus—that the Slates would
take what they wanted, and let the Federal Ge
Vurnment supply itself as it could—that the public
defences, and all th  proper objects of Federal ex-
pendí ure, wou'd be stinted and sacrificed, that the
money might be taken to be dmfed among the
States This is what I «aid four years ago; and
short as the time has been, we have seen it more
than realized The twenty-seven millions depo-
sited wiih the Sutes until needed for the uses of
the Federal Government, have been needed, are
now needed, and cannot be h-d They are gone
foreier' The public man is nrt m existence who
dan s to c^ll for it, or any part of it Even tho e
w>-o reproached me for saying it would not be re-
turned cannot venture to ack its return, and if they
dil, tí ey would be told it could not be paid—that
the S ates, fa1, from beme able to refund what they
had received, were compelled by their necessi-
ties to cdll upon us tor more1 The pub
lie defences have a'most disappeared from
public view. I endeavored for some time to make
a stand upon this point, I endeavored to rouse-the
Senate and the country to the necessity of attend-
in  to the public defences Wi>h what effect?
None, but to make myself an object of derision •
to be literally laughed at, and cried down under
the clamors for distribution! My worhy co1-
league [Dr Linn] now ventures to mention u
ag.un as a proper direction to be given to the pub-
lic land revenue he makes ihe proposition as the
antagonist of distribution the frmnds of dis'ribu-
uon will overwhelm his proposit on Sir, I «aw
and foietold many evils from the commencement
of ibis di.'nhution policy, but 1 did not foresee all
tht evils of it Things have taken place already
which my imagination, gloomy as it was, and bod-
ing c tl as i> did, co ild not foresee I did not frre
s p that, m six shoit a onlhs after the first deposite
bul pa sed, a econd o le should be offered, and not
o I) ofterMl, but saddled, contrary Id all parlia-
mentary rule—comriry to ail lair legislation—upon
a bi'l of a totally different character—upon a forti-
fication bill which was actually sunk and lost un-
dei the fore gi and unnatural load I did not
f< rese" this m June, 1836, when I declaimed
pgiinst th^ evils of the distribution scheme, but Í
did see it in January, 1837, when it actually hap-
pen d ' Ne ther dil I foiesee an accusation of
tiaul against the Um'ed Stite for not depositing
nine mill o'-s more, when she had nothing to depb-
sn  or lo u e, and w as da/en to the issue of Trea-
sury n^tes for her daily support Neither did I
foresee the motion of tins d^y—Ihe motion of the
ScrVor lrom Kentucky 10 make distnbnuon of the
land revi u° at a time when ihe Federal Treasury
wís in want of every dollar which the lands, ani
the cti toms, and every o her source of levenue
can I ring to it I did not foresee these things, but
llvn have happened They have come upon us
anil (he?confirm me in my original opinion, that
this distribuí on policy is the most fatal step ever
j et taken in our Government It brings the States
upon us for th« ir supplies it makes them look fo ns
for all the money which they want, and they have
the power to tak  what they please    The Union
