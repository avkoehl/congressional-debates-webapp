Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Following just received from my aide at Martinsburg:

Colonel Mulligan dangerously wounded, perhaps mortally. There is undoubtedly a large force in our front. Our forces hold their lines, except the cavalry, which has behaved disgracefully.

Major General GEORGE CROOK,

Commanding Forces in Shenandoah Valley, Winchester, Va.:

GENERAL: Your telegram of yesterday's date I have received. This telegram contained information valuable to the enemy, and was read by every operator from Grafton to Baltimore. In view of this, and f the further fact that messages are liable to be taken from the wires by those in the interests of the enemy, I suggest that hereafter they be put in cipher, when important, and transmitted, so long as practicable, by couriers sent to these headquarters direct, it being but a few miles farther to this place than to Martinsburg.

I am, very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
