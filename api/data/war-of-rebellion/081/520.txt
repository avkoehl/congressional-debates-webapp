Captain B. F. FISHER,

Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac:

I have the honor to report all quiet to-day up to this time. No rebel messages to report. No movements observed. We had a big scare night before last expecting an attack and were consequently kept on the qui vive all night. The rebels signal station is at work, but messages house station is evidently abandoned.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. FULLER,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.

Working party of thirty of enemy constructing new works half a mile north-northeast of the town and near the Jones house. No movement observed this p.m.

WARTS,

Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 30, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Have you any news from your front to-day? Wilson was badly handled yesterday about 1 p.m., losing all his artillery and trains and being obliged to fall back in disorder. Kautz, with about 3,000, got in last night, but nothing is known of Wilson with the balance. Wright reached Reams' at 6 p.m. In his dispatch of 7.30 [7.15] a.m. to-day he has heard nothing of Wilson or the enemy, nor has Sheridan yet joined him. You must be very vigilant to-day, pushing out your pickets and those of Wright, and reporting at the earliest moment any movement of the enemy. Wright will stay at Reams' until Sheridan gets up and we get some positive information about Wilson.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 30, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

Information has been received to-day to show that part of the infantry that went to Reams' Station to assist in attacking Wilson has returned.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
