WASHINGTON, December 14, 1864-2 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

General Canby ordered Steele to Cairo before he received the orders of the War Department or my letter. By these orders Steele was to report to him at New Orleans. I think from Canby's letter that arrangement will suit him. I would not change the order till Canby is heard from, after receiving the general order, as he has very few good officers and I think will want Steele's services.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 14, 1864-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Although Warren was called upon last evening on receipt of your telegram, and again this morning, I am yet without any further details than those transmitted in his dispatch of the 11th. In the absence of a report from Warren, I have made a resume of the operations from my personal knowledge, which I send for your consideration.* As soon as Warren's report is received it will be transmitted.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 14, 1864. (Received 3 p.m.)

Major-General MEADE:

I wish you would have special attention directed to ascertaining if Hill's corps has gone south. It looks much as if it had.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 14, 1864-4.30 p.m. (Sent 4.45 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Deserters came in this a.m. and last night, belonging to Pegram's division, who reported their division being relieved last evening by Lane's brigade, of Hill's corps. They were of the opinion, and from reports, that all of Hill's corps had returned or were returning to their old position. Their division (Pegram's), they said, was moved farther to the right on being relieved. This is all the information we have of Hill's movements.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
