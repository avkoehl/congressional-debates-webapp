Birney advanced at the same time from Deep Bottom, and carried the New Market road and entrenchments and scattered the enemy in every direction, though he captured but few. He is now pushing on toward Richmond. I left General Birney where the Mill road intersects the New Market and Richmond roads. The whole country is filled with field fortifications thus far.

CITY POINT, VA., September 30, 1864.

General Warren attacked and carried the enemy's line to-day on the extreme right, capturing a number of prisoners. He immediately prepared to follow up his success. Petersburg paper of to-day has a rumor, which it says is not confirmed, that one brigade of Sheridan's cavalry was ambushed and destroyed at Swift Run Creek. Early was to have attacked Sheridan at Mount Sidney on the 28th.

CITY POINT, VA., October 1, 1864-10 a. m.

The enemy assaulted General butler's line north of the James River three times yesterday afternoon, and were repulsed each time, General Butler reports, with heavy loss. Late in the evening Potter's division, Ninth Corps, whilst moving to get to the left of Warren, near Poplar Spring Church, was vigorously assaulted by a superior force and driven back until re-enforced by Griffin's division, when the enemy were checked, General Meade thinks, with heavy loss. Potter lost from his division a considerable number killed, wounded, and captured. The enemy are now threatening our left in considerable force. Our line extends full two miles west of the Weldon railroad with the left turned back. The troops entrenched themselves during the night.

U. S. GRANT,
