G. E. PICKET,

Colonel P. A. C. S., Commanding.

Donelson' brigade, 1,300 strong moves to-day for Petersburg. Eight and Thirteenth Tennessee, Floyd's brigade, require repose. There is no disorganization whatever the men are in fine spirits. A paymaster should be sent up at once. They have not been paid since June 30. I estimate the amount required at 3,000 man for four months. Is this line to re-enforced?
