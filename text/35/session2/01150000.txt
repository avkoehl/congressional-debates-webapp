Thirty-Fifth Congress, 2d Session.

New Series No. 73.
going on, and it seemed to me singular that the
Committee on Finance should have placed in the
hands of the civil department of the Government
last year enough for $36,000,000 of expenditure
and $4,000,000 of balances, which would make
together $40,000,000, and then expect that he
could have $4,000,000 left this year, when he
asked for only $19,000,000, and estimated for only
$19,000,000, as if you were going to get alongthis
year for about one half what you did last. I have
no idea of any such thing. It is hard work to get
a dollar off one of these appropriation bills. 1
thought I never heard so fallacious an argument
as that which the Senator from Virginia made on
that occasion. The Secretary of the Treasury
asks this year for $19,000,000 for the civil list,
on which last year he spent twenty-sixor thirty-
six million dollars, and yet you expect him to
have just as much left over from a $19,000,000
estimate as he had from a $36,000,000 estimate,
with a $4,000,000 balance on hand from the year
before. If he has cut down these estimates to
$19,000,000, I should look upon it pretty much
as the Senator from Georgia did when he was
speaking about these tables. He said he had no
faith in tables that were made up to produce a re-
sult. The Secretary of the Treasury is trying, in
my deliberate judgment, by these statements on
paper, to make us believe we can get revenue
enough under the present tariff, to show that a
revenue system which yields $42,000,000, is
enough to enable us to get along this year; and to
show that we can postpone any action on the reve-,
liue system of the Government for another year;
and he has estimated for $19,000,000 for the civil
list, though he spent last year $36,000,000 as the
Senator said before; and now he says $26,000,000.
Mr. HUNTER. Twenty-three millions is the
estimate, and $4,000,000 the outstanding appro-
priations.
Mr. SIMMONS. He estimates now for
$19,000,000, with liberty to use $4,000,000 of the
outstanding appropriations, making $23,000,000
altogether. X say, if lie spent $26,000,000 last
year, and had $4,000,000 of balances left over
from the preceding year, he must have had
$30,000,000 at his disposal during the year. If
he estimates for only $19,000,000 now, he must
calculate that this Government is to get along
with nearly half the expenses of last year, saving
$11,000,000. I thought it was a very extraordi-
nary estimate, to suppose that he could getalong
with $23,000,000 this year, when he spent
$36,000,000 last year. I am astonished that the
Senator from Virginia should suppose that the
Secretary, when he estimated $19,000,000 of
expenditures for the next year, would have
$4,000,000 left, as well as he had when he had
$40,000,000 at his disposal.
Mr. HUNTER. We spent last year only
$26,000,000 on the civil list, exclusive of the pay-
ment of the nubile debt; and we know we re-
deemed a good deal of debt in the last fiscal year,
which we shall not do this when we propose
to spend $23,000,000. I propose to limit him to
the §19,000,000, which he has estimated for. If
he spends a certain amount out of the outstand-
ing balances of last year, let him retrench on the
others, so as to have the same amount this year.
Mr. SIMMONS. Suppose he spent $26,000,000
last year, and estimates for $19,000,000 this year.
If he had $26,000,000 last year, and an outstand-
ing balance of $4,000,000, it is clear he had
$30,000,000 at his disposal last year; and, if he
asks now for but $19,000,000, and you are going to
restrict him to that, you cut off $11,000,000 from
the civil list. That is a kind of paper calcula-
tion. It will never be carried out in piactice.
Mr. HUNTER. How can it be cut off
$11,000,000? He estimates for $19,000,000; and
I propose to confine him to $19,01)0,000. He
estimates fur $19,000,000, besides $4,000,000 of
outstanding balances. I propose to confine him
to the $19,000,000; and if he pays the $4,000,000
outstanding, let him leave that amount of the
present appropriations to apply to the liabilities
of that year to be paid in the nest.

Mr. SIMMONS. But how will the Senator
from Virginia get over the result ? If lie confines
him to $19,000,000, with an outstanding balance
of $4,000,000, and denies him the right to spend
the $4,000,000, how will he pay $26,000,000 with
$19,000,000? Do you pretend that you mean to
curtail the civil list $7,000,000 this year ?
Mr. HUNTER. 1 would curtail it to $19,000,-
000.
Mr. SIMMONS. The result will be that you
will curtail it to make a paper-showing, and have
a deficiency bill next session. This, in my delib-
erate judgment, is a mere pretext to get over this
session without supplying the revenue. I do not
think the Senator from Virginia believes—af least,
I cannot conceive lie has that opinion—that we
are going to reduce the expenditures on the civil
list from $26,000,000 down to $19,000,000 this
year, because I do not see anybody who is willing
to vote anything off any appropriation bill that
comes here to pay officers. But, sir, I have no
idea of embarrassing the Government. If the
Secretary of the Treasury, or if the chairman of
the Finance Committee, will point out to me the
items of saving in the next year from the last,
which will amount to $11,000,000, I would go
with him; but is there nothing estimated for the
public debt in the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasury ? I should like to ask the Senator
from Virginia, the chairman of the Committee on
Finance, who has charge of these bills, if there is
anything in the $19,000,000 estimate of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury that goes towards the pay-
ment of interest on the public debt?
Mr. HUNTER. When I had occasion before
to refer to this matter, I showed that in the case
of one bill the only use that was proposed for the
outstanding appropriations was to pay the liabil-
ities that had accrued in the previous fiscal year,
but could not be paid then. From the nature of
things, the same liabilities must exist in the next
fiscal year. These balances were not to be used for
the service of this year, but for the service-of the
preceding year. Therefore it is that I propose to
limit him to what he has estimated to be used out
of the annual and permanent appropriations.
Mr. SIMMONS. 1 asked one question, and
the Senator has answered another. I asked the
Senator from Virginia if, in this estimate of the
Secretary of the Treasury of $19,000,000 for the
civil list fur the year to come, there was any item
included for the payment of interest on the public
debt ?
Mr. HUNTER. There is.
Mr. SIMMONS. Then, including that item,
this is an estimate to correspond with the $36,-
000,000 of the year before. I have a way of cy-
phering as I go along; and no man can undertake
to cover up an item of $10,000,000 in an appro-
priation of this sort by answering one question
when I ask another. If the item for interest on
the public debt is'included in the $19,000,000 es-
timate, I ask the Senator how he is going to get
along with less than $36,000,000? True, there
was $3,000,000 of public debt purchased last
year; but we now have intet^t to pay on
$40,000,000 of debt which we had not the year
before. He must have estimated for the interest
on these $19,000,000, and that is an offset to all
the purchases of stock which he made the year
before. The interest on the public debt is from
two to three millions more than it was last year.
Now, I should like tu ask the Senator from Vir-
ginia if there is any pretense that he is going to
save $17,000,000, when the interest is larger than
it was before?
Mr. HUNTER. The Senator makes his whole
case by misstating the premises. What I af-
firmed was, that there were $26,000,000, exclusive
of the payment of the public debt, expended last
year. Now, he says there were $36,000,000 in-
clusive of the payment of the public debt; and he
argues that there will be more to pay foi the pub-
hc°debt the next fiscal year than last, when it is
notorious that we redeemed a good deal of public
stock last year; and when, also, it is notorious
that, in estimating that amount, we already charge
the Government with every Treasury note that
is redeemed, although it may be reissued; arid
thus they swell the amount, nominally, far be-
yond what is really paid. These $10,000,000 are
to be thrown out of the question. You have to
compare for the saving, between the $26,000,000
antl this estimate of $19,000,000 and a fraction—
I have not the figures by me: I say that'is not
an extravagant estimate for reduction. There are
items estimated for, upon which there might be
reductions. Many of the public buildings might
be suspended, and the Department might very
well reduce the amounts expended upon them. I
do not understand that the outstanding appropria-
tions are to be used for the service of the next
fiscal year; but they are to be used to discharge
liabilities of this fiscal year. Now, if ,there are
liabilities in this fiscal year, they are not paid off,
because they, cannot be presented until the next;
there wjll be liabilities in the next year which
cannot be paid off, because they will not be pre-
sented until the year after. The Secretary has
himsen estimated that all he will want to use out
of the permanent and indefinite appropriations,
and out of the annual appropriations, is between
nineteen and twenty million dollars. I propose to
confine him to that. I propose that if, out of the
$4,500,000 of unexpended balances, the whole
amount be not necessary in order to meet the lia-
bilities of the preceeding fiscal year, the residue
should not be expended—should not be used
along with the annual and permanent appropria-
tions for the service of that year.
Mr. BIGLER. I think I understand theSenator
from Virginia; and if not, lie will correct me. If I
understand him rightly, there is no connection be-
tween the estimate of $19,000,000 for the year and
the $4,000,000 of balance of unexpended appro-
priations. Then, it is a simple question of time.
The $19,000,000 and the $4,000,000 must be paid.
The object of the Senator is to confine the whole
payments for the fiscal year to the $19,'000,000.
Now, suppose it should become necessary, and
is right, that the Department should expend the
$19,000,000, and the unexpended appropriations
of last year of $4,000,000: what does it amount
to ? Simply a deficiency. The Secretary would
be unable to make the payment, although the'pay-
ment was demanded and was due; and we should
be obliged immediately to pass a law repealing
this interdiction, or pass a deficiency bill. It in
no way affects the amount to be paid, but only
.restrains it as to time. During the next fiscal
year, under the amendment, only the $19,000,000
could be paid, as I understand, and the Secretary
would be obliged to retain an amount of unex-
pended appropriations equal to the last year,
whether it was proper we should do so or not.
If I am right in this understanding, I am'unwill-
ing to vote for this amendment. I do not see
what is to be gained by forcing an unexpended
balance. If we save it, it is one thing; but as I
understand the Senator, we do not save it.
Mr. HUNTER. The Secretary of the Treas-
ury estimates that he will want so much for the
civil list, whichjs a sum between nineteen and
twenty million dollars. He estimates that, in ad-
dition to that, he will want a sum between four
and five million of the outstanding balances, in
order to meet liabilities which will be made in this
year, but not paid until the next; and here is
what he says:
" The existing appropriations, part of which are required
for.the payment of the liabilities of the present fiscal year,
but which will not be drawn from the Treasury until after
June 30, 1359, and the balance applied to the service of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1860."
Now, it seems to me, we have a right to con-
clude thatthere will be as much of the liabilities
of the next fiscal year left for payment in the suc-
ceeding as there areof this fiscal year left for pay-
ment in the next. That is all I ask. For the rest,
I give all that he estimates for the service of the
next fiscal year.
Mr. COLLAMER. I understand that the Sec-
retary estimates that he will want, besides^the un-
expended balances, $19,000,000. 1 understand
