FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Joseph:

Some 200 or 300 bushwhackers and Paw Paws remain holding Platte City. Colonel Ford, of Kansas City, seems to be preparing to strike. This is all known here.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

GLASGOW, MO., July 12, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS;

Colonel Ford goes to Platte City to-day with 400 of his regiment, Mountain Hogs. Can you co-operate with him against Thornton, and make a clean thing of Platte and Clay Counties? Ford will reach Platte City to-night.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, July 12, 1864

Major-General CURTIS:

I have the honor to request that you co-operate with me in striking a blow at the guerrillas, treacherous Paw Paws, who now hold Platte City. Please join in a combined movement from Saint Joseph, Kansas City, and Fort Leavenworth. Put in 300 men if you can spare them, and arrange plans of operations with Colonel Ford and Captain Holloway, assistant adjutant-general.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

General C. B. FISK,

Glasgow:

I can co-operate and can strike heavy blows if desired, but I must have special request to remove the clamor of intrusion. It would be well for you to lead. You know the disposition to slander outside troops. Rosecrans telegraphs he is preparing to clean them out. Are you and he in concert?

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

GLASGOW, July 12, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I had intended my morning telegrams as a request for you to go into Platte County on a mission of retribution. Don't hesitate a moment. Arrange the plans of operation, and give the traitors cause to remember the day.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
