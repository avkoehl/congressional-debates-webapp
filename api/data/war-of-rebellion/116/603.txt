Colonel Dimick and Lieutenant-Colonel Burke are instructed to send the privateersmen now confined at Forts Warren and Lafayette to Fort Monroe for exchange. Among those from the former post are several who aver they were impressed in the service and desire to take the oath of allegiance. They have been ordered to Fort Monroe notwithstanding, and can make their statements before the commissioner. There are also with that detachment six men taken in merchant vessels while trying to run the blockade. They have been ordered to be released and will be forwarded through our lines.
