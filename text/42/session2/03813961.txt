THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOSE.
8981
ators were allowed to pass bills for want of
a quorum. I give this notice now, therefore,
that Senators who are present may be here
this evening. If the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania says he desires an executive session I
have no objection to it.
Mr. CONKLINGr. Then it is understood
that the Senator will not yield for any bill to
be taken up at half past seven o'clock except
the tariff bill?
Mr. SHERMAN. I give that notice; but
unless a quorum is present, as a matter of
course I can do nothing.
Mr. CONKLING. I am very glad the Sen-
ator has given the notice. I think it is right.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania moves that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive
business.

The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
proceeded to the consideration of executive
business. After thirty minutes spent in exec-
utive session, the doors were-reopened, and
at five o'clock and fifteen minutes p. m. the
Senate took a recess uutil half past seven
o'clock p. m.
EVENING SESSION.
The Senate reassembled at half past seven
o'clock p. rn.
The bill (EI. R. No. 2938) granting the right
of way to the Utah, Idaho, and Montana Rail-
road Company was read twice by its title.
Mr. POMEROY. That has been consid-
ered in my committee, and if there is no ob-
jection I should like to see it passed.
Mr. SHERMAN. It had better be referred.
Mr. POMEROY. Let it lie on the table for
the present, until to-morrow morning.
Mr. SHERMAN. Very well.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. I ask the
Senate 
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senator was not
present when I gave a notice before the re-
cess. There was complaint made last night
about my giving way ; several Senators com-
plained bitterly ; and I gave notice to-day be-
fore the recess that I would ask for the regular
order, and Senators said it was right.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. I did not
hear it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There is a con-
ference report to be made.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will yield to a confer-
ence report, or to anything that is in its last
