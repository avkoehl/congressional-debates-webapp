Ho. .OF PilvPS.:
the same kind $95,000, making a difference of
§80,000. An American wooden ship of the first
class cannot he constructed for less than $85 per
ton, whereas the same kind of a ship can be
built in European or Canadian waters at a cost
of less than $00 per ton. 'If the cost of iron
machinery is added to that of a sailing vessel,
the aggregate of the tax oft the iron used is
very much greater. Now, if this duty on pig
iron and those on the different forms of man-
ufactured iron were reduced, our ship-yards
would soon present a very different appearanoe
from what they now do. When the position is
assumed that the duty under the present tariff
on pig iron should be continued substantially
in order to insure employment to American
labor, it becomes quite pertinent to inquire
what number of laborers are thereby deprived
of employment in the single industry of ship-
building. The answer to this inquiry is well
stated in the following extract taken from the
last report of Hon. l)avid A. Wells:

struction of vessels for uso upon our inland waters."
In this connection, as I must necessarily bo
us brief as possible, I wish to say that although
the present (arilf of high duties lias and is in-
liicting great and lasting injury by destroying
the ship-building interests of tlui country, there
is another view J wish to nresent, and that is
how the taxes on the articles entering into the
construction of ships afl'eot the agricultural
interest of the country, lit order to do so I
will give n list of tlieso articles, with the ratio
of taxation on them:

[twill be perceived that many of the articles
in this list aie. the materials of which railroads
are built, and wagons, ears, locomotives, and
steamboats are constructed. The tax of $!)
a ton on pig iron is a tax of $3 a toll on rail-
road iron ; and this tax, and the tax on wood,
and the tax On boiler iron and plates, and the
lex on jiaiiits, and the lax on steel, and tho
tax on oils, are so many burdensome taxes
collected in increased freights from the corn,
oats, wheat, barley, flour, pork, beef, lard, and
all the othi-r products of the fanner which have
to be. trauspoi ted from the place of production
to market. The difference in the price, of these
great staple products of the agriculturists of
the country ia the market and at the plaee of
production is to a very great extent made up
of these taxes on tire thiiu'S thai enter into the

construction of railroads, cars, locomotives,
and steamboats. ■ , ,
While it is true that the present bill reduces
the duty from $9 to $7 a ton on pig iron, yet
by breaking up the long-established classifica-
tions of the different tonus of manufactured
iron the tax on iron is actually increased to
the consumer. As the duty on pig iron is re-
duced it ought logically and necessarily to fol-
low that the duties on other forms of manufac-
tured iron and steel should also be reduced.
The duty on steel is increased 40 per cent., and
this increase is on the kinds of steel that are
indispensably necessary to the industries of
every farmer and mechanic in the land.
Sir, it is estimated that the exorbitant taxes
which the people as consumers have to pay on
the different forms of manufactured iron in
increased prices amount to $35,000,000 every
year. And these taxes bear more heavily upon
the farmers than any other class. They are
made to feel them in the cost of every article
into the manufacture of which iron enters. All
their labor-saving machines are taxed—their
reapers, mowers, and drills; all their imple-
ments of husbandry, their plows, spades, axes,
and hoes. Their household cutlery is all taxed.
Tho stoves that heat, and the loeks and holts
that secure their houses, are taxed. Their
wagons and carriages and harness are taxed,
and every nail that is driven into the roof of
their houses and into the shoo with which then-
horses are shod is taxed. In short, wherever
tltcic is a use for iron there is it, tax to he paid. ;
When wo add lo these manifold taxes tho taxes
I hey have to pay on their sugar, ten, inul j
coffee; on every article of weatirig apparel,
from tho hals on their heads to tho shoes on j
their feet; on the lumber with which their I
houses and fences are built; on tho salt intheir j
daily food: and oil the 4,000 other articles I
embraced ia the tariff, sir, I ask if we shall
not soon have to pay theffl a subsidy for rais-
ing wheat and com if these excessive taxes are
continued?
The increase of the tax on steel rails from 1
cent per pound to 2 cents per pound, as pro-
posed in this bill, is another burden imposed
on the western farmers in theeost of transport-
ation. The direct effect of these taxes on
iroii, lumber, salt, &c., but a small portion of
which goes into the Treasury of the Govern-
ment, is to increase the cost of the production
and transportation to market of every bushel
of graitt raised on the farmer's land.
The cost of transportation in this country is
now nearly three times as much as in England :
and I call attention'to the following statement
of an Ohio farmer, communicated to the Cin-
cinnati Commercial, of the cost of producing
a bushel of wheat in that State upon the aver-
age of 120 bushels to an acre :

Now, sir, this table shows, as my colleague
has said, a loss per acreage of $4 07 011 wheat.
The acreage of wheat in Illinois for the year
18C8 was returned at 2,483,478. If the acre-
age was the same, the loss on wheat alone to
the farmers of Illinois for the last year, if sold
at present prices, is $11,59S,000, an amount
equal to the entire national banking capital of
the Slate; on corn about $3,000,000, and on
oals about, $4,000,000, making in all a loss of
$13,000,000 in that State in a single year. As
there were 10,000,000 acres of wheat raised in
1808 in the northwestern States, and the aver-
ago yield was about 2 bushels more to the acre,
the loss 011 wheat at present cost and prices is
$35,000,000. What manufacturing interest is
suffering a depression, equal lo that of the great-
est branch of American industry? Who is to
mako np this enormous loss to tho farmers?
What relief does or can your high protective
tariff afford them?
Mr. Chairman, wc arc boastfully told by
the advocates of a high protective tariff that
their system secures American laborers from
competition with tho " pauper labor" of Eu-
rope. Sir, if there be any class of laborers in
England that can be denominated paupers they
are those engaged in agriculture. They earn
a scanty subsistence 011 wages that barely save
them from want, and nsu&liy end their unhappy
lives- as dependents upon charity. On the
Danube is another class of agricultural labor-
