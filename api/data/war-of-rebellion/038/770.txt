GRAND GULF, April 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Everything ready, as far as means permit. Reports from enemy give his fleet over sixty guns, including some on transports. All busy above, repairing damages. General [M. E.] Green is here. Shall I assume command of DIVISION, or regard him as temporarily attached to post?

JACKSON, April 20, 1863.

General BOWEN, Grand Gulf:

Take command of DIVISION, but retain command of your brigade. I look upon Grand Gulf as more to defend Big Black than to prevent passage down. Fire only deliberately.
