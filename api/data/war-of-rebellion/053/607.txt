BRISTOL, September 5, 1863.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Enemy ran up to Jonesborough last night and occupied with two trains. This morning reached Carter's Depot, Watauga bridge, and demanded surrender of garrison; this refused, and I expect a conflict has ensued. No bridges burned yet. Will hold them to the last. Hope re-enforcements may come to relief soon.

A. E. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.

MONTGOMERY, September 6, 1863.

General COOPER:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Bragg.

Cannot send him more than the force he asks for. Shall I do so?

CHATTANNOGA, September 6, 1863.

General JOHNSTON:

Hasten a division of infantry to Atlanta if you can spare it only for a few days. It will save that depot and give me time to defeat the enemy's plans.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

J. E. JOHNSTON.

SEPTEMBER 7, 1863.

Your telegram of yesterday is obscure. Send, however, all the force you can spare.

MORTON, MISS.,

General BRAGG,

Chattanooga:

Dispatch received and referred to General Johnston at Montgomery. I am under the impression all the troops that can be spared from this department have been sent.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

MONTGOMERY, September 6, 1863.

General BRAGG,

Chattanooga:

I can spare no troops without risking Mobile; but if it is to save Atlanta I will send two small brigades for a few days. Reply and tell me the plan to be defeated.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
