States   on thit  subject      Representations  Vvtre ,
made to this Depiitment in the littpi pait of the
yeai 18S3, by the  Butish Minister at Washing
ton, on the pait of the authorities of New Bruns
wick, complaining of infractions of the under
standing subsiding between the two Governments
m legaid to the disputed teintoiy     These com
plaints, howevei, on being íefened to the Gov-
einois of Maine and Massachusetts for explana-
tion, were believed  to be without just giounds
Theie waf> no complaint on the part of Maine, and
the coirespondcnce which took place on the occa-
sion, is not supposed to be within the scope of
the íesolution of the House
As the negotiation between the United States

PAY OF «AV\L OFFICERS.
The House the n pi oeeeded to the consideration
of the unfinished special order, being the bill to
regulate the pay of the officers of the Navy of the
Umttd Slates
The question being on the motion of Mi
Allien, of Viigima, to commit the bill to the
Committee on JNaval Affans, \nd the amendment
thereto offered by Mi "VIumn, of New Yoik, to
add the woids " with msliuctions to piepaie a
bill to equalize the pay of the ofhceib of the Ai my
and Navy,"'
Mr MANN of New Yoik, roseand sud.that
having, Ixfoic the IXousi adjouimd yesterday",
nio\ed to amend the motion ot the honorable gen-
tleman ft 1)111 Viigima, by iddmg instiuetiuns to
the committee to lepoit a bill to equalise tuc pay
of the Vimyaud Nivy, he would now endeavor,
btieily at, possible, to submit a few considcia-
tions in tavoi of the oiigm il motion, as he pio
pobed to ami nd thesami, uid igainstthe pissage
ot the bill We hue (sad Ml M ) piofcsstd
to be an eionomnal, ie]mhluan, plain people
It his been sud th it oui Govunmcnt, in its

ry, ie|tctmg all puuleged classc s, all exclusive
legislation in fivoi of the f^w at tin expenso of
tlie many, pio icding upon tin pimciple " that
all men aie cie tied equal," has commanded alike
the admirition of pituotibm and philanthropy
Its piaetiee thus fai has mainly eonfoimed to its
theoiy Occasional deviations fiom the lepub-
lican Hack will be found m oui history, but he
(Mi M ) tuisud these would only foim excep-
tions to genual rules and punciples,and not lulos
and principles themselves II at my tune, in our
(,ood nature, in our gcnciositj , 01, if you please,
libti ahty, we overstep the bounds of pi udence, and
do vióleme to thit justice which thenition owes
equally to the most humble as the most exalted,
we ought soon to expect to mict the coirective at
the ballot box Mi Speakci (sud Mr M ) the
presentera will formahnght page in our national
histoiy, unle&s, by oui own acts, we shall wan-
tonly ca&t a shade over it, which will grow daiker
by agi, until the ícmembrunce of the present
shall become unwelcome to the recollections of
men By the economy and fiugahty of oui re-
publican habits, undei an honestad ministration of
our financial afiaus, oui national debt, (by some
maintained to be a national bhssing,) which in
1817 amounted to «¡,123,000,000, has been paid off,
and the anomaly in the history of the oppiessions
of the human ¡ace is now piesented of a great
nation out of debt, possessing acciuing suiplus
revenues toan extent which may piovedangerous
to its purity and obnoxious to its safety Aie we
(said Mr M ) about to commence a system of
extiavagant legislation, creating high galanes,
sinecures, perquisites, allowances., douceurs, and
pnvileges, which will lay the foundation of a new
nation il debt, to prove moie cruel and endunng
than has ever yet excited the fears of our people '
There are those, sir, (said Mr M ,) m theatmos-
phere suirounding this Capitol, who will answer,
" Never fear—the laborer is woithy of his hire,
an¿ his hue is not enough to supply his wants,
and his necessaiy luxunes and enteitamments—
his lespectabihty must be suppoited 01 the nation
is disgiaced " Put the question (said Mi M ) to
oui constituents, I do not mean the wealthy and
luxurious of our large cities and towns, but the
gieit planting and fanning in tei est of thecountiy,
and lfi have not grossly mistaken their opinions,
theiranswcr will be, "liue, the laborei is woithy
of his hue, and let that hire be reasonable, even
hbeial," but they will be careful to add a warning
against extiavagance This bill, sir, (said Mi
M ,) may be consideied as a pioneer to a system
wlni h the peculiar situation of our financial
affans, the generous and better feelings of our
nature towaids our gallant ofliceis, invites and
alluies us—a ¡system uf prodigal expendituies of
the puUic revenues, for the benefit of our favoi-
ltes, to'siicncc their clamors, and pamper then
appetites^ wholly inconsistent with a just sense
of oui duties to the country, the purity of its laws
and administration, and destructive to its welfare
We have been reminded of our overflowing
Treasury, and that republics are ungiateful—we
hear, spoken m eloquent accents—our national
greatness, our bravery,our liberality, our justice,
our honor, oui debt of gratitude to those who
protect and defend us fiom "perils by sea and by
land," but, sir, (said Mi M ,) pardon mefoi the
apprehension, that this is the " siren" to our
vanity, which lulls to security, and "deceives but
to destroy."
I tru'st, sir, (said Mr M ,) that the lessons
gathered from the history of European oppres-
sions have not all been yet lost to the people, and
that there is yet a spiut which maybe awakened
to a sense of danger—which will shield us from
the evils that have been inflicted upon those na-
tions, by the adoption of systems of bounties,
pensions, and sinecures, which have turned all
the pioperty of those kingdoms out of the hands
of honest mdustiy, into the laps of luxurious
idleness and vice
Mr Speakei, when this bill was under consid-
eration before the Committee of the Whole, I
had occasion to say that it was alittle icmaikable
thatapioposition to equalize the pay of the Ai my
and Na\y should so readily have resolved itself
into an (ffoit simply to inciease the pay of the
Navy, and I desued (said Mr M ) to bemfoimed
by what process and for what íeasons, the ou-
ginal object h id been abandoned by the commit-
tee, and then effoits directed only to increase the
pay of the Navy The chairman of the commit-
tee [Mi Watmough] has contented himself by
answeung that it was found impracticable to un-
dertake to leduce the pay of the Army, without
endangering the success of the principal object of
raising the pay of the Navy It is true, sn, (said
Mr M ,) that the Aimy and Navy have ahead y
gained so much influence ovei our legislative
councils that 1'is impiacticable w> restiain their
control ? The veiy pioposition is sufficiently
alarming, but the admission of it upon this floor
is astonishing' Does the gentleman mean to
admit that it is impiacticable to reduce the pay
and emoluments of the swarms of officers of the
Aimy, because they are unwilling to be reduced,
and that, theiefore, we mustabandon thatbranch
of the subject, and comply with the demands of
the officers of the Navy, by raising their emolu-
ments up to the standard of the Aimy'
Mi WATMOUGHexplained, andsaidhehad
made no sueh admissions or declaiations that he
was aware of, as the  gentleman had supposed
He must have been misunderstood
Mi MANN continued He was confident the
honorable gentleman had made such lemaiks in
answer to his (Mr M 's) inquiry, although, per-
haps, the gentleman had foigotten himself, m
the zeal with which he pressed this bill Why,
sir, (said Mr M ,) the course of proceedings of
this committee seems to me to amount to such
an admission, othei wise, for what reason, I ask
again, did the committee abandon their original
object of equalizing the pay of the officers of the
Army and Navy > I am aware, sir, (said Mr
M ,) that the six hundred and three officers of
the Army are a more numerous, if not a more
dangerous, boa y than Congress They com-
mand six thousand five hundred and ninety five
men, that is an average of one officer for about
ten men, fiom which it might be inferred, that
the men are under a sufficient discipline for a
peace establishment. Mr M hoped that the
honorable gentleman had not taken counsel fiom
his fears of this airay in arnving at his conclu-
sion, that it was impiacticable to legislate as to
the pay and emoluments of this branch of the
public service Will it be denied, sir, (said Mr
M ,) that some remedial legislation, in regaid
to the emoluments of the officers of the Army,
would be beneficial to our finances, if not to the
"■morale " of the Aimy itself Let us look into
this "ingratitude of republics " The honor-
able gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Allen,] who
addressed the House yesterday on this subject,
wat  mistaken in what he said in respect to the
pay of the officers of the Aimy He might
easily be mistaken, sir, (said Mr M ,) because,
in looking into the documents generally on this
subject, although you have a bureau here for
every division and subdivision of duty, there is
confusion and uncertainty—I will not say a fraud-
ulent suppression—in regard to the allowances
ami emoluments of the officeis of the Aimy.
Sir, (said Mi. M ,) the Blue Book, compiled
eveiy two years, pursuant to a law of Congress,
under the direction of the Secretary of State, is
required by law to " exhibit the amount of com-
pensation, pay, and emoluments allowed to each
officer or agent " Now, sir. in regard to the pay
of the Army, this document only shows the pay
and allowances to your major general—$200 per
month and fifteen rations per day A brigadier
general, $104 per month and twelve rations, and
thus through the different grades. Sir, (said
Mr M ,) we shall soon learn that this celebrated
Blue Book does not tell us half the truth. I do
not know whose fault it may be, but, sir, in
respect to the Aimy, this book is not entitled to
the least credit In document maiked B, accom-
panying the report of this bill, the pay and emol-
uments of a major general are stated to be
$6,512 64, a brigadier general, $4,422 48 In
another document, sir, (said Mr M ,) accompa-
nying the same report, called statement A, under
the joint signatures of the Secretaries of the War
and Navy Depaitments, I find the following
statement, which I beg leave to read for the in-
formation of the House.    Mr  M read

Sir, this statement does not agree with the state-
ment first mentioned in any one item, yet it must
be taken and deemed as authentic as any other,
as far as it goes It does not profess to show all
the allowances made to the officers of the Army.
Under most circumstances, these officers are en-
titled extra, to double íations, fuel, quarters, sta-
tioneiy, transportation, or traveling allowance,
besides a special extra average per diem allow-
ance of two dollars on court-martial or special
duties 1 cannot learn, sir, (said Mr M ,) from
any documents within my reach, what all this
