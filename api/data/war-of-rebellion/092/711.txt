HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Little Ogeechee, near Savannah, GA., December 14, 1864.

Major General P. JOS. Osterhaus,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

In sending you inclosed order* (Numbers 194) the major-General commanding desires me to say that he deems one brigade of General Hazen's division sufficient to hold Fort McAllister and King's Bridge, leaving the balance with General Smith's division, to be moved around to the right by transports. General Blair, leaving third Division in present position, and one brigade of General Mower's division on the canal, will have four brigades to move. the general also desires me to say that he considers it of the utmost importance to have the road to King's Bridge placed as soon as possible and kept in good hauling condition; and, to this end, suggests that each section of it be placed in charge of a good, competent officer, who will see that the work required is done with as little delay as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. L. TAGGART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

He will take immediate steps to put the fort in order, cleansing it and adopting a proper system of policing.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps;

GENERAL: It is represented that there is no guard at King's Bridge, or that, at least, there was none last night. It was supposed that General Hazen would leave a guard for it, but it appears he did not. As you are intrusted with the repairing of that part of the road please see that the bridge is properly protected.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:

SAML. L. TAGGART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
