HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Stevenson, Ala., August 30, 1863-10 p.m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Comdg. Twenty-first Army Corps, Dunlap, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs you to move your entire command (except the brigades of Hazen and Wagner) as soon as practicable down the Sequatchie Valley. Supply yourself with everything necessary for an active campaign. Your trains can cross the Tennessee at Bridgeport, and your troops at Bridgeport, Shellmound, or Battle Creek. Reynolds is now crossing at the latter place. McCook's corps is crossing at Bridgeport and below. Leave Generals Hazen and Wagner where they now are, with orders to watch carefully the crossings of the river and show a threatening from to the enemy in that direction. Wilder's and Minty's brigades will remain there to co-operate with them. The present indications are that Bragg will fall back from Chattanooga, and if we bring him to battle at all it will be between Dalton and Atlanta. Should he thus fall back, direct Wagner and Hazen to cross the river and occupy Chattanooga, and close down upon our left. It is very important to seize the enemy's pontoons at Chattanooga, if possible. Keep open communication below your whole line and with these headquarters.
