and banking interests of this country, might have
produced it but it is by no means certain
There was, however, a manifest cause of this
suspension, in the connection of our Treasury with
the banking and trading interests of the country,
under which they hid to encounter the pressure of
the deposite act, and, what was moie powerful still,
the hostility of the Bank of the United States and
its friends I do not refer to the deporte act with
a disposition to criminate gentlemen who suppoited
it. The surplus was an evil. They discharged
whit they considered a paramount duty in getting
rid of it, but they did not foresee the disastrous con-
sequences which would follow the sudden with-
drawal oí so large an amount flora the bank  at
such a crisis. That iva1; not, hewever, the only
measure There «as a sjpplementarv act which
you yourself, Mr Chairman, (Mr Smith of Mame
being in the chair,) moved out of its order and car-
ried through this Hou«e at midnight on the list
night of the session That act authorized the im-
mediate transfei of the public money from bank to
hank, and State to State, and it was for executing
hoth these laws together that the Secretar) of the
Tieasury has been so unjustly censured Let us
suppose, sir, that England had a surplus of five
hundred millions of dollars which, in a ratio io her
revenue, would be equivalent *o our fortj millions
Suppose it to be deposited in the local banks, and
that Paihament had oidered it to be withdrawn in
nine months and distubuted among the counties m
England, at a time too of a heavy pressure on the
money market Would it not have broken all the
banks in Great Britain and Ireland' If this five
hundred millions had been deposited m the Bank
of England and its branches, and had been, as < u'S
was, employed in commercial discounts, the shook
to trade and banks would have been still more a io-
Jent from the convulsive but vain efforts of the
Bank of England to meet the demands of the Ex-
chequer and to sustain specie payments Such, sir,
must be the condition of trade and banking m every
country where they are unued with the fluctuating
revenues of Government
The next obvious consequence of this connec-
tion, is the five years'war of the Bank of the United
States, and its friends against the d°nosite banks,
the Treasury and the country itself What, sir,
is the brief history of this war' The ^resident, in
discharging a high public duty, know ng the im-
mense power of such an institution, ana forest mg
the mischiefs which wou'd result from ptijetuatirg
it, brought the question before Ihe nation for its
decision. Without waiting for that decision, the
bank memorialized Congress six years before the
period for winding up its concerns, and a bill was
passed through both Houses, with a knowledge
that the President would reject it The pretext
th n was, that it was necessary that the bank
should at that early period know its fate, and com-
mence winding up its concerns gradually The
election of the President in the same yeai, (1832,)
ratified his veto. Steps were taken to emp'oy othei
banks, and towards the close of the next year th°
deposites were partially removed The bank, anti-
cipating this order, commenced the first campaign
against the deposite banks, the Treasury and the
country, by curtailing rapidly The pretext for
this step was the necessity of fortifying herself to
meet the hostility of the Executive m with hawing
the deposites. And pray, -what was the enormous
amount of these deposites' Not thirty-seven millions,
sir, the amount ordered to be removed iind r the
deporte act, but less than seven, nay only about
three millions at that time, for some of it remain-
ed more than a year afterwards Nor was it trans-
ferred from city to city or State to State, but with
little exception, from one bank to another in the
same city. Yet, alarmed at this tremendous order,
which had been anticipated for months, th s great
bank, with its capital of thirh-five millions, was
afra'd of the  1eposite banks, and v as compelled to
curtail its discounts r^ore than eightee i millions in
nineteen months The alarm wis spiead through
our cities, the local banks -were forced to follow its
example, and trade, which had been m a prosperous
course, was suddenly brought to a stand without
any commercial cause wha'e/er. The celebrated
panic session opened with the cry of rum and revo-
lution, and our cities were foi months agitated by
the stormy < onflicts of < parties. The first cam-
paign for a Bank of the Un ed States terminated
with that session
Foiled in this experiment upon the depesite banks
and the country, the president of the bank changed
his policy This ci ipp'e ' msututton, almost bmken
dewn by its efforts to pay ovei a few millions to
other banks, as soon as Ihe v ss on was over, sud-
denly found itself able to enlarge its discounts to
the amount of ten millions' The bank commenced
extendirgits facilities in November, 1834, and m
eight montns included them more than nineteen
millions of dollars. The tridm  an-1 baiAiri - m-
teiests of f1" c mn+r ', after being so long chained

The hanks genei illy followed the example of ihe
United StalfS Bank, by enlarging their discounts,
and eveiy hi inch of tiade was stimulated *o en-
gage in the wildest speeulat on  If all the banks
in the country had contracted and ecpanded m the
same ratio, it would have made an aggiegate fluc-
tuation in commercial facilities of near three bun-
dled millions The fluctuation of the Bank of Ihe
United States a'one iiom Aoril, 1833, to Toly,
1835, amounted to about thir'y-eto-M m Ikons
Suppose, sir, the Bank of England had not its capi-
tal, its deposites and circulation invested in public
securities, suppose, instead of its meie surplus, it
had its foity millions sterling employed in commer-
cial d scounts, and that the bank, stiugglmg to com-
pel the country to lenew Us charter, weie to curtail
and exlen I its discounts in two years and ttiree
months more than twenty millions sterling—what
would have been the condition of the tiadeand
local banks of GreH Biitain and Ireland at this
time'? Precisc'y what ours is The cío e of this
second campa gn has been triumph int—more than
triumphant—foi the president ot the bank and its
friends have not only broken all the deposite
banks, but almost every other bank not excepting
the Bank of the United States with its thirty-five
millions, although rechartered with additional
strength and enlarged powers The Bank of the
United States has contributed its share m increas-
ing the calamities of the day It has triumphed
over the deposite banks and the Treasury, but it
has not yet conqueied the people ©f lie United
States
Now, in the midst of all this wreck of credit,
while the vielims in this v-n he scattered around
them, srentlemer, as if m meckeiy, invoke the aid
of lb" trading and banking interests to engage in a
third campaign, and foi what, sir' Por a national
bank, which they dare not themselves propose,
which they admit tQ be hopeless, which stands con-
demned by the people, who, after all these strug-
gles, have sent to both Houses the largest majori-
ties eycr known, aga nst even the expediency of
saofe an fe&rci!""1. The merchants rid bankers
of fea ©35217/ ars ag?m mv-ited to engage m a
third aad ssa.eidal war, to keep tiade and banking
in violent agitation for th' ee y eats to come, an 1 to
tei inmate the campaign in another scene of bank-
ruptcy and rt in None but the determined parti-
sans of the Bank of the United Stales will answer
to the call The intelligent and candid of all par-
ties mu^t be convinced, after five years'bi'ter et-ie-
r'ence that the tradme and banking interests of the
country have nothing to gam by enl stmg in our
political nais, and that so long as their fortunes are
associated wuh the fluctuating reverses of this
Government, they must be period cally broken
down
In thc-e contests, sir, the credit of our banks has
been destroyed. Weha'e made discoveries, too,
which warrant (lis belief that we may anticipate a
similai violation of the contracts of this country,
and destruction of its currency, at every viol-nt
íevn'sion The member-- of our stc ck exchange
have found out that vdien stocks are depiesscd by a
nrcssure, and they aic thieJteie ! wi'h lan, tl ey
cansare thenis ! es, and r~ise stc \s tweny or
tin ty per cent by compelling She bank- to suspend
specie payments The bankshave discovered, too,
that they have absolute dominion over cur State
Legislatures, through the power which thev exei-
cise over the currency and the country. Indeed it
is probable that in a period of alarm, which exists
in every revulsion, trade may solicit the banks to
suspend their payments. It may not happen that
all the banks will suspend; but nothing can prevent
many of them from falling in every revulsion, but
an entire separation of their concerns from those of
the Government.
The State bank deposite system has most unques-
tionably (ailed, notwithstanding it is still supported
by a few, but a very few, friends of the administra-
tion. The present crisis drives us to the necessity
of choosing between a Government national bank
of vasi power, and a simp'e Treasury agency with
no other power than that which this Government
has al a ay s exercised in collecting and disbursing the
public revenue Althougb^emlemen have not yet
the courage to unfurl their banner every where,
yet theie can be ro doubt there is still tobe a strug-
gle for a national bank The gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Sergeant) tells us we flourished
under the auspices of such an institution for forty
years, and that the experiment was fully tried, and
was trmmphant. It was certainly fully tried, but
I deny that it was triumphant. It was at all times
a frail foundation foi the vast fabric of credit of
this country The suspension of specie payments
bv *he Bank of England in 1797, protected the first
bank till its charter etpmd Ido not know that
its solidity was ever tried bufonee, when an emi-
nent merchant of Sal m would have broken the
branch at New York, and consequently al! the
other banks, if it had not yielded to his demands
As to the late Bank of the United States, we have
the authonty of two of its presidents one tells us
that in 1819 no man believed the bank would con-
tinue to pay in sp«cie for one mouth, and the other,
that in 1825, the currency of the Union depended
upon his mid light journey from Philadelphia to
New Voik A \eiy solid foundation th s tor the
trade, enrrene , and contrac's of a nitron1 As to
its conservative power over State banks, v e have
had innumerable failures ef them during ihe exist-
ence of both; and all the money which „we have
actually lost by local institutions, amounting to
moie than a million, was lost when the late Bank
of the United States was in operation
A national bank, such as we have had, vas an
experiment indeed, and a fearful one too. It was
without a parallel m the history of Governments
I appeal, sir, to the gentleman fiom South Caro-
lina (Mr Legare) whether Franc or England
ever ohaiteied a national bank to e riploy the leve-
nues of Gov ernment in comme-cial discounts, to
regulate exchange, or to furnish a national currency
founded upon the ciedit of private stockholders'!
If the banks of England oi of France were per-
mitted to use the vast revenues of these countries in
extending facilities to trade, and their income, like
ours, was constantly vibiating between an enor
mous surplus, without a public debt to absorb it,
and a sudden deceit of íevenue, it v ould be disas-
trous to the trading and banking interests of all Eu-
rope Norwasany s,¡ch bank ever established to re-
gulate exchange The gentleman from South Caro-
lina well knows that the exchanges of Great Bn-
tam, Ireland, and of all Europe, are managed by
local '.?nkb and pTivt'e bankeis, and that the lat-
ter are almost exciusweh employed fir that pur-
pose o i the con* nent They aie infinitely bettei
manage' theie than they ever have been here The
laws of trade alone can regulate exchange. But
even their operation is defeated by the course n ir-
sued by the banks m this country, and especially
the Bank o  ihe United States and the deposite
banks. They have encouraged a wild spirit of
speculation, by discounting millions of exchange
not founded upon property, but a mere exchange
of cred is between distant points, and of notes
payable at a bundled places m the interior, counter
to ihe curre i' of remittance io the Atlantic cities
Tue mam cause ho vever of the derangement of
oui ir ternal exchanges is one which is unavoidable,
tb it is Ihe periodical and sudden decline in the
ríen staple of rem nonce required t« d scharge
the debt annually due from the so ithwestem to the
tk rtheastern Slates. There is more elasticity in
our foreign exchanges, and with a judicious reform
of our currency we have little to fear. Our com-
mercial tables may alarm us, but they afford no
atisfaetory evidence of the  amount of debt due
