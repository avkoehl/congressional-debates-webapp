It seems that Colonel Harrison has received a dispatch prior to the on from this office and sent another battalion in place of Williams'.

Respectfully,

NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant - General.

CHARLESTON, November 22, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

It seems that General Sherman is marching to the coast; I believe to this place. You will see by last department returns that I have not the troops to make a defense by land. If troops or withdrawn from the harbor batteries, the enemy's fleet and troops are in sight and ready to enter. I earnestly ask for re-enforcement, and such instructions as may be thought necessary. Lieutenant - General Hardee is in Georgia, and communication with him cut off.

SAM. JONES,

Major - General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA, &amp;C.,Charleston, November 22, 1864.

[General HARDEE?:]

GENERAL: I have sent Mr. Toombs, chief engineer C. S. S. Chicora, of the Navy Department, with some torpedoes, which he thinks he can use to some advantage against the enemy in their advance through Georgia. I have directed him to call on you and explain the nature of the service on which he is sent, and I have to request that you will give him such aid as you can to enable him to carry out the object in view.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major - General.
