SUPPLEMENT TO
■which he owesby the obligation he has assumed
to preserve, protect, and defend it. The right
of the President to appear by counsel of his
choice makes it as clearly proper, under the
obligations of a liberal profession, and under
the duty of a citizen of a free State of sworn
fidelity to the Constitution and the laws, that
we should attend upon his defense ; for though
no distinct vocation and no particular devo!«on
to the more established forms of public service
hovers our presence, yet no man can be famil-
iar with the course of the struggles of law,
of government, of liberty in the world, not to
lsnowthat the defense of the accused becomes
the trial of the Constitution and the protection
of the public safety.
It is neither by a careless nor capricious dis-
tribution of the most authentic service to the
State that Cicero divides it among those who
manage political candidacies, among those who
defend the accused, and among those who in
the Senate determined the grave issues of war
and peace and all the business of the State ;
for it is in facts and instances that the people
are taught their Constitution and their laws,
and it is by fact and on instances that their
laws and their Constitutions are upheld and
improved. Constitutions are framed; laws es-
tablished ; institutions built up ; the processes
of society go on until at length by some oppos-
ing, some competing, some contending forces
in the State, an individual is brought into the
point of collision, and the clouds surcharged
with the great forces of the public welfare buist
over his head. It is then that he who defends
the accused, in the language of Cicero, and in
our own recognition of the pregnant instances
of English and American history, is hold to a
distinct public service.
As, then, duty has brought 11s all here to this
august procedure and has assigned to each of
us his part in it, so through all its responsibil-
ities and to the end we must surrender our-
selves to its guidance. Thus following, our
footsteps shall never falter or be misled ; and
leaning upon its staff, no man need fear that
it will break or pierce his side.
Tho service of the constitutional procedure
of impeachment in our brief history as a na-
tion lias really touched none of the grave inter-
ests that are involved in the present trial.
Discarding tho first occasion in which it was
moved, being against a member of the Senate,
as coming to nothing important, political or
judicial, unless to determine that a member
of this body was not an officer of the United
States ; and the next trial, wherein the accusa-
tion against Judge Picketing partook of 110
qualities except of personal delinquency or mis-
fortune, and whose result gives us nothing to be
proud of, and to constitutional law gives no pre-
cedent except that an insane man may be con-
victed of crime by a party vote; and tho last trial
of Judge Humphreys, where there was no de-
fense, and where the matters of accusation
were so plain and the guilt so clear that it was
understood to be, by accused, accusers, and
court, but a mere formality, and we have trials,
doubtless of interest, of Judge Chase and of
Judge Peck. Neither of these over went for
a moment beyond the gravity of an important
and solemn accusation of men holding digni-
fied, valuable, eminent, public judicial trusts;
and their determination in favor of the accused
left nothing to be illustrated by their trials
except that even when the matter in imputa-
tion and under investigation is wholly of per-
sonal fault and misconduct in ollice politics
will force itself into the tribunal.
But what do we behold here? Why, Mr.
Chief Justice and Senators, all the political
power of the United States of America is here.
The House of Representatives is here as accu-
ser; the President of the United States is here
as the accused; and the Senate of the United
States is hero as the court to try him, presided
over by the Chief Justice, under the special
constitutional duty attributed to him. These
powers of our Government are here, this our
Government is here, not for a pageant or a
ceremony ; not for concord of action in f,ny of
the duties assigned to the Government in tho
conduct of the affairs of the nation ; but here
in the struggle and contest as to whether one
of them shall be made to bow by virtue of con-
stitutional authority confided to the others, and
this branch of the political power of the United
States shall prove his master. Crime and vio-
lence have placed all portions of our political
Government atsomedisadvantage. The crime
and violence of the rebellion have deprived this
House of Representatives and this Senate of
the full attendance of members that might
make up the body under the Constitution of the
United States, when it shall have been fully
reestablished over the wole country. Tho
crime and violence of assassination have placed
the executive office in the last stage of its main-
tenance under mere constitutional authority.
There is no constitutional elected successor of
the President of the United States, taking his
power under the terms of the Constitution and
by the authority of the suffrage ; and you have
now before you the matter to which I shall call
your attention, not intending to anticipate here
the discussion of constitutional views and doc-
trines, but simply the result upon the Govern-
ment of the country which may flow from your
determination of this cause under the peculiar
circumstances in which, for the first time, too,
in the history of the Government, a true polit-
ical trial takes place.
If you shall acquit tho President of the Uni-
ted States from this accusation all things will
be as they were before. The House of Rep-
resentatives will retire to discharge their usual
duties in legislation, and you will remain to
act with them in those duties and to divide
with the President of the United States tho
other associated duties of an executive charac-
ter which the Constitution attributes to you.
The President of tho United States, too, dis-
missed from your presence uiieondemned, will
occupy through the constitutional term his
place of authority, and however ill the conrsc
of politics may go or however well, the Gov-
ernment and its Constitution will have received
110 shock. But if the President shall bo con-
demned, and if by authority under the Consti-
tution necessarily to be exerted upon such
condemnation lie shall be removed from ollice,
there will be 110 President of the United States ;
for that name and title is accorded by the
Constitution to no man who has not received
i the suffrages of the people for the primary or
' the alternative elevation to that place. A new
tiling will have occurred to us ; the duties of
the oflice will have been annexed to some other
ollice, will lie discharged virlulc ojjlcii and by
the tenure which belongs to the first ollice.
Under the legislation of the country early
adopted, and a great puzzle to the Congress,
that designation belongs to this Senate itself
to determine by an officer of its own gaming
the right under the legislation of 17!W to add
to lii.s office conferred by the Senate the per-
formance of (he duties of President of tho Uni-
ted States, the two ofliccs running along.
Whatever there may be of novelty, whatever
of disturbance, in the course of public affairs
thus to arise from a novel situation, is involved
in the termination of this cause; and there-
fore there is directly proposed to you, as a
necessary result from one determination of
this cause, this novelty in our Constitution : a
groat nation whose whole frame of govern-
ment, whose whole scheme and theory of poli-
tics rest upon the suffrage of the people, will
be without a President, and the oflice seques-
tered will be discharged by a member of the
body whose judgment has sequestered it.
I need not attract your attention, long since
called to it, doubtless, in your own reflections,
more familiar than I am with the routine, to
what will follow in the exercise of those duties;
and you will see at once that tho situation,
from circumstances for which no man is re-
sponsible, is such as to bring into the gravest
possible consequences the aet that you are to
perform. If t lie President of the United States,
elected by the people, and having standing be-
hind b im the second officer of the people's
choice, were under trial, no such disturbance
or confusion of constitutional duties, and no
such shock upon the feelings and traditions
of the people, would be effected; but, as I have
said, crime and violence, for which none of the
agents of the Government are responsible, have
brought us into this situation of solicitude and
of difficulty.
It will be seen, then, that as this trial brings
the legislative power of the Government con-
fronted with the executive authority, and its
result is to deprive the nation of a President
and to vest the office in tho Senate, it is indeed
the trial of the Constitution ; over the head
and in the person of the Chief Magistrate who
fills the groat office the forces of this contest
are gathered, and this is the trial of tho Con-
stitution ; and neither the dignity of the great
office which he holds, nor any personal inter-
est that may be felt in one so high in station,
nor the great namcandforceof these accusers,
the House of Representatives, speaking for '' all
the people of the United States," nor the au-
gust composition of this tribunal, which brings
together the Chief Justice of the great court of
the country and the Senators who have States
for their constituents, which recalls to us in
the mere etiquette of our address the combined
splendors of Roman and of English jurispru-
dence and power—not even this spectacle
forms any important part in the watchful solic-
itude with which the people of this country
are gazing upon this procedure. Tho sober,
thoughtful people of this country, never fond
of pageants when pageants are tho proper
thing, never attending to pageants when they
cover real issues and interests, are thinking of
far other things ilmn these.
M r. Chief J ustiee, it is but a few weeks since
the great tribunal in which you habitually pre-
side, and where the law speaks with authority
for the whole nation, adjourned. Embracing,
as it does, the great province of international
law, the great responsibility of adjusting be-
tween State and General Government, the con-
flicting interests and passions belonging to our
composite system, and with determining the
limits between the coordinate branches of the
Government, there is one other duty assigned
to it in which the people of the country feel a
nearer and a deeper interest. It is as the
guardian of the bill of rights of the Constitu-
tion, as the watchful piotector of tho liberties
of tho people against the encroachments of
law and government, that the people of the
United States look to the Supreme Court with
the greatest attention and with the greatest
affection. That court having before it a sub-
ject touching the liberty of the citizen finds
the hainstiing of its endeavor and its eneigv
to interpose the power of the Constitution m
the protection of the Constitution cut by the
sharp edge of a congressional enactment, and
in its breast carries away from the judgment-
seat tho Constitution and tho law to bo do
termined, if ever, at some future time and
under some happier circumstances.
Now, in regard to this matter, the people of
tho United States give grave attention. They
exercise their supervision of the conduct of ail
their agents, of whom, in any form and in any
capacity and in any majesty, they have not yet
learned to be afraid. The people of this coun-
try have had nothing in their experience of the
last six years to make them fear anybody's op-
pression, anybody's encroachments, anybody's
assaults, anybody's violence, anybody's war.
Masters of this country, and masters of every
agent and agency 11^ it, they bow to nothing
but the Constitution", and they honor every
public servant that bows to the Constitution.
And at the same time, by the action of the
same Congress, the people see the President of
the United States brought as a criminal to yonr
bar, accused by one branch of Congress, to be
tried by the other, his office, as I have said, to
be put in commission and an election ordered.
He greatly mistakes who supposes that the
people of the United States look upon the office
of President, the great name and power that
represents them in their collective capacity, in
