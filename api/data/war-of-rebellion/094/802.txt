General S. COOPER:

General Beauregard's suggestions about Roodey were made at my request, and did not contemplate leaving North Alabama unprotected, but simply to delocalize the troops for the good of the service.

Respectfully,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

Mr. WINTER,

Agent State of Louisiana:

General Beauregard has however told me that he would, in the absence of any prohibitory instructions from the War Department to him on the subject, grant the necessary authorizations for such exchanges upon the application of the Governors of the respective States.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.
