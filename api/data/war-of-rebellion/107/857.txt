Major General W. B. FRANKLIN,

Commanding near Williamsport:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 8.30 this morning is received. General Reynolds can take his militia back to Pennsylvania. General Kenly's brigade will remain at Williamsport to guard the crossing. You will please remain in your present position till further orders, gaining all the information in your power about the enemy's movements, and using your own discretion about operating against any force that may show itself in your vicinity. Should you ascertain that the enemy have any cavalry on this side, you will, of course, endeavor to prevent their escape. The enemy's pickets are still on the river opposite us. Nothing else new.

Yours, very truly,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

COMMANDING OFFICER CAMP OF FRANKLIN'S CORPS:

SIR: The commanding general directs that you proceed at once to join General Franklin's command at Williamsport, with all the wagon train and equipage belonging to it. Your route will be along the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown pike (the only one leading north from Sharpsburg) to Jones' Cross-Roads, where it is crossed by the road from Boonsborough to Williamsport, and thence along the latter road to or near Williamsport. The empty wagons, if you have any, might be sent in advance of the rest of the train, as they will be needed to draw supplies from Hagerstown.

Yours, very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

If you have wagons to arrive to-day with supplies you [will] leave or send directions for them to follow you.
