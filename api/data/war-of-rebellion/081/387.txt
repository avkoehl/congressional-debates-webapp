HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS

June 24, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

The information gained from prisoners is to the effect that Hill's whole corps was engaged in the attack on my left flank yesterday, and that it retired soon after dark. I am in expectation of getting some positive information at any moment.

Major-General WRIGHT.

The commanding considers it desirable that a small reconnoitering party of cavalry should move several miles down the old Norfolk road, which runs along the line of the Norfolk railroad, crossing it repeatedly.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS.

June 24, 1864-9.30 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Of the reconnaissance sent our by me, a party on the left had almost reached the railroad, probably there now. Colonel Bryan says he thinks there is no doubt that his cavalry sent out the road by Doctor Gurley's is now on the railroad as just before he started to see me it was reported very near to it.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 24, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT.

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Have the cavalry scouts or parties been as far down the plank road as its intersection with the road from Prince George Court-House? According to the maps they intersect at the crossing of Warwick Creek, or Warwick Swamp. The next point of importance appears to be the vicinity of the cross-roads from Reams' Station, Weldon road, and from Prince George Court-House. Information from those points in connection with that from the crossings of the railroad between here and there is what appears to be wanted.

A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
