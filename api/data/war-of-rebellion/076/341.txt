I am on the point of starting to the right. Will move headquarters to the neighborhood of General Howard. Have you any reports from the front? There seems an unusual quiet prevailing.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 3, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I am just in from the right. General Schofield has one division across Utoy, and General Baird was crossing at 6 p. m.; pretty severe skirmish but no battle. I came by General Logan's, who has been fighting with artillery and picket-lines all day. He carried a line and took 50 prisoners. Enemy retook the pits, but our skirmishers got in safe. General Logan again took them, with 150 prisoners, his loss very small. He still hammering away when I left him along his line, and this relieved the pressure on generals Schofield and Baird. I think by morning he will have a lodgment across Utoy, on or very near the big Sandtown road, that will seriously threaten the railroad. I have heard of General McCook and am well pleased. I heard very heavy firing up your way. tell me all about it.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 3, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The firing you heard was Stanley making a demonstration with his skirmish line. The enemy's skirmishers replied briskly, wounding perhaps 50 of our men. We captured about that number of rebels. Sutermeiter is firing upon the town to-night.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 3, 1864.

Major-General:

McCook is all right, near Dallas, with 1,200 men. I send his report to you.* Will have him reorganize to-morrow at the railroad bridge.
