OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., May 23, 1863.

Colonel B. L. E. BONNEVILLE,

Commanding Benton Barracks, Saint Louis, Mo.

COLONEL: Your letter of the 6th instant was received some days since, and in reply I have to say that the issue of clothing to the crew of the Queen of the West was very proper. These men belong to Ellet's brigade, thought not soldiers, and it is proper that an account of the issues to them should be sent with them when they join their command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., May 23, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel F. A. DICK,

Provost-Marshal-General, Saint Louis, Mo.

COLONEL: Orders have been sent to-day to the general commanding the Department of the Missouri directing that all prisoners of war at

Saint Louis and Alton be forwarded via Baltimore to City Point. In executing the order you will receive from General Schofield you will be governed by his instructions and those heretofore given from this office on similar occasions. All military organizations, regular or irregular, are classed as prisoners of war, and none will be detained except by the order or approval of the general commanding the department. Send duplicate parole rolls signed by each prisoner with them and a roll without parole to this office. Give the commander of the guard particular instructions to permit no person to hold communication with the prisoners by the way nor will he allow officers or others to go to eating or drinking houses. If you have money belonging to them in your possession turn it over commander of the guard with the names of those to whom it belongs, to be handed to them on arriving at City Point. The commander or the guard should notify the quartermaster at Baltimore of the time of his arrive there, giving the number of prisoners, so that he may have rations prepared for them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
