Should you think it necessary for the preservation of order to occupy the country to the line of the Etowah, and, if you think you have sufficient force to do so, you are authorized to make such occupation, stationing your troops, say, at Rome, Kingston, holding the fords of the Etowah in that region and at Cartersville. You can use the regular brigade for that purpose. Such occupation would be for the purpose of assisting the county courts to get to work. If the country would remain quiet without such force, it had better remain nearer Chattanooga.
