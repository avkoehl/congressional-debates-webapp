HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 20, 1862.

General McCOOK, Battle Creek:

I will return your brigade to you as soon as our communications with Nashville by the railroad are established securely. The reports accumulate constantly of the movement of a considerable column upon Nashville. That is possible and we must be prepared for it, but must also look well to your quarter. If on Nashville, it is more likely to come from Kingston than Chattanooga. Does Jasper or that vicinity afford as strong a position as where you are? Study your theater well in all directions; spare no pains or money to get reliable information form all quarters. Let me hear from you frequently.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 20, 1862.

General NELSON, Murfreesborough:

Colonel Miller telegraphs that you report the enemy in force at Murfreesborough and that you have called down the Sixty-ninth Ohio from Nashville. The force at Nashville must not be reduced. Troops are nearer to you along the railroad, but they must not be withdrawn without evident necessity. Is it true the enemy has appeared in force?

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 20, 1862.

General MANSON, Athens:

Have your brigade prepared to march to-morrow morning with five days' rations and 50 wagons of the supply train of your division. Have all the artillery to march also, but probably in a different direction. I learn that the old provost marshal and guard have been replaced by General Nelson from his division. Restore them at once and have those now on that duty form the Fourth Division join their regiment. Inform me exactly where the remainder of your division is and what force besides is at Athens?

D. C. BUELL.

ATHENS, July 20, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Colonel Hazen's Nineteenth Brigade is repairing the railroad at the points indicated in your dispatch. I cannot say exactly where General Nelson is with the Tenth Brigade and two regiments of mine. Besides two regiments of the Fourth Division there are five companies of the Twenty-first Ohio, under Major Strong, and Jackson's cavalry, under command of Major Murray, at this place. Will be ready to move to-morrow morning.

MAHLON D. MANSON,

General.
