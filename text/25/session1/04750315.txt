SPEECH OF MR. SMITH,
Of Maine,
In //c House of Representatives, September %&y 1837—On the
bill to po t¡ one the tourth mstalmeut of deposite with the
States
Mr SMITH of Maine, said it was not his oriirinal intention
to have pauicipated 11 the debate upon the bid now before the
committee, but the course ol remark which other gentlemen
who had addre'^sed the committee had induced, induced him to
desire t) ptesent to the conmittee a few remark" He «aid he
would not l^tam the committee to go Urgely into rnv topic in

Mr ^ n )) wi i n r\ ) e«ssi&n oi 1 ceic't,c:itt tha' inv iio 1 1
ble inendand colleague from Mame, (Mi fan field,) who ad
dressed the com mttee on yesterday, should have deemed it ne
cessary, either to a justification of his own position, 01 the eluci
dation of his views upo 1 the subject before the committee, to 50
back to the motives or aaguments that influenced the support
or opposition made 10 the deposite act oí June, 1836 But my
honorable friend thought proper to go thus far back, and to
claim great credit, and perhaps Í might say great glory, for him
oeifaud the little minority of forty, or forty three, who voted
against that act Now, sir, I contributed the-vote and mfiu
ence of one humble member upon this floor in supporting and
carrying that act through this House, in the modified shape
which was impar ed to the bill that came from the Senate
And I can most sincerely delare for m>t¡elf, and I think, m do
nig this I accoid a'so with the feeling of eveiv other gentle
mm, m relation to him«e!f, who \oti d in favoi of th it bill that

for one, as the gentleman A om Maine ha* thotuht it pi ope' to
go nto an examination of the matter, and to court it, to enttr
into an adjustment of the piai-e ind t engine that 1  attachable
to the friends and the opponents of that measure, and to strike
the balance sheet ot gloiy up to the presentttme
To this end, let me mqu re sn to whom we a*e indebted as
a nation, for the fact, that we have notat this time upwards of
thirty ^even millions oi dollar- in funds that are utterly una
vailable to b">th the Federal Government ard to the several
States, in the diffeient local ban s of the country, m&tead of
only some nine millions * The States have received three
fourth- of the surplus moneys of the Federal Government, that
was bt ought within the ¡>cope oí the deposife art of Tune 1^3S
1 he other fourth part is now m the ham's oí bank  ami coipo
rations tha,. are unable, at this time, to pa\ it back to the peo
pie And I repeat the mqm^ to whom wc are mdtb ed foi
having oulv thia fourth partof the people 3 monev thus locked
up in private corporation* and whoPv unavailable, instead of
haung thiry R*ven millions ol dollars in the same situation1
Aie we ii debted t-n, foi this, to tin little mino itv of forty to
whom the gen f em an alluded and of whprn he boas ed"? If
their policy could hive prevailed, the people ol the several
State-, woiili not only h ive h ul nine mill ons btumoie htn
thirty seven millions of tl eir money in the In "ids of the-e lidl
hinkmg corporations unavailable and unproductive oi mteiest,
in any event, beyond a very small amount Sir, thi^ 11 the
stoiy which htstorv now tolls us relative to the wisdom and
good effect ofthedepo-ite act ol 1S36, ind tbi« lestil' veiifiete the
truth of the position upon whieh I supported that acton Its
passage
But my honorable friend =-ai 1 by way of fmther leproach
upon that act, and by wa\ 0! eulogizing the mmouu opposed
to it that the act had crea'ed quarrel* amon« he pe tple—ar
rayt d the liehagdnfit the poor and the pooi ajram-t the rich
Well, be n so V 1 i w>n i<> accmntabV foi this consequence?
Tina is the work of the people nd n  t of the repiesema'ive
I sir, have not learnt > et tha* it 1- within the ptOMnceoi he

hold them re*pon-ibh to himself for piai-eor cenóme On the
contiao, I have c^et acted upon the prim ¡pie'hat n wa^the
piovmce ofthe peopTe to su¡)ervibo and qucs ion at plea^uie
the doings ofthe representative And to me tht ngmuent of m>
honorable friend on thi^ po nt «¡eems to prove if it pro^esiny
thing, that the people 'hen^elves are not capable oí minag ng
their own money, and are not to be ei ti usted with the keepnt 
or the disposition of it Tbis i« an argument to which Í low
no assent 1 have not yet acceded to its correctness m prac
tice or theory Nor do I see m it any thing that mducet me to
regtet that the deposite actoflSSfi has succeeded m returning
to the people three-quartera 01 the sui plus money beyond the
waeits or the Government, that had been collected of them
I only regret that the remaining quarter is not equally secure
to th&m
liut, mr I will now come to the provisions of fhe bill imme

expediení y >f postf oning the payment of the foui th instalment
of depo-ites with the S ates 1 am satisfied lhat the Treasury
la not in <t i ond m n to pay it at th s time But, sir, I dislike
the pro^ ísion oi the bill sent to us for this purpose by the Se
nate    It n ¿di> as follows
" T he &ame is hereby postponed till further piovistou by law
Prvcided That the ihree first msUln ents undet the ^aid act

ed by Congress "
My üb,ectton to this ^ror^o which vanes the bill from thai
repor ed bv the Coinmitit-c of Ways, and Mea is, on the part of
thi-s Hou-e i-s that, imdei covei of a postponement, it co/uerts
the deposite actoj hint, 1S-j6, into an act of distubulwn oj
thr pvbitc revenues among th* glutei It requiies the enart
meat of a ! ¡w to 1 c%tore the money to the Treasury Tin-  di
wvs the money of every pi lncip'e of a deporte I belies e
now as lever hive believed tha Congress has no constitution
al power to pjss uen a distribution act Without th hprox ,0
of the Senate s bill I wo fid cheeifuily accede to the ame d
merit of the ¡lonotablegenileman from South Carolina, (Mr
Pickc\s,) which proposes to postpone the payment of the
fourth instalment to a d*y cer'am, matead of to an indefinite
period, a? piopobed by the Committee of Way and Mean« I
aecord with the sentiment expies<5e¿ the othei da> by the gen
tinman ftom Penn^} Ivania [Mr Biddle] that the intention of
a law shnuhl be cltarly expressed on the face of it And as I
in  induced to think hat the effectof the bill ofthe Commit ee
oí Ways and Means will bean actual lepeal ofthe fourth in
etalmeotof depositea with the States, under cover of a post
ponement, I should much prefer to see the bill assume the
-nape ofa^oM/ire repeal I cannot say that this is the pur
pose of the Committee of Way« and Means, they can best tell
that, but considering the condition of the Treasury, and the
inability of the depusite banks to refund the deposites they
have, 1 should prefer an open and direct proposition to repeal
the fourth instalment of deposites with the States to a post
ponement ' until further provision by law,5 which appears to
me to mean, in fact, a j epeal under cover of a postponement
But, sir, da the proposition cannot assume that open shape now,
I shall, said Mi Smith vote for the postponement, preierunsr,
howevei, a postponement to a definite time as proposed by
the gentleman from South Carolina But-, sr I am agamet

Havine &aid thus much as to the pameulai pi oposición oí 1
the bill, I will invite the attention of the Hou«p to a review of
some ofthe positions which have been taken bj gentlemen who
aie opposed to both a repeal and a postponement of this fourth
instalment I find, bir, that these gentlemen form two classes
Fir t, a class v*ho insist upon it that they do not understand
the report ofthe Secretary of the rrea&uiv and, therefore, are
unable to perceive the necessity of po&tpoiiing this instalment
And, secondly, a class who eo for a payment of this money to
the States at aay rate This latter class is a^ain d visible into
two classes—those who claim the instalment a15 a matter of
solemn contract between ^the Federal Go\er*ment and the
States, and tho«e who claim it upon the principle of distribu
Uon ofthe public moneys among the States
Now, fcir, to those gertlemen who insist upon 1 tha the report
of the "leer-etuiy of to" Tiea^ui-v is not 11 t it ib e tnd th
