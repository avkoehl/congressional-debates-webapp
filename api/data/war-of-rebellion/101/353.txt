cannot consider the posts in Southern Kansas among those absolutely needed. You do not seem to me to appreciate the necessity for breaking up posts and mustering out troops. I cannot apply for more horses or anything else. If you cannot accomplish results with what you have they must be left undone. No orders countermanding the mustering out of Stolbrand's brigade have been received, so it must be mustered out. You have not answered about Fort Scott. I want you to furnish Sully with one regiment of infantry, at least 600 strong, in time to be out at Rice by October 1. It matters not how or whom what. I have applied for regulars for the plains. Rush everything so as to get through by middle of October.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, August 11, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis:

I ordered all posts in Kansas broken up before I left and stores removed, except one or two on southern border of Kansas to watch Indians, border, and carry out orders in relation to cattle stealing, and left on that border the Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry. We will have to keep one post there until matters are settled. Part of the Sixth West Virginia Cavalry are out at Fort Leavenworth waiting for horses. Cannot you send some from Saint Louis? If we do not get them off soon we will lose them all by desertion. The number of troops deserting on plains very large and dissatisfaction great. I wish some steps could be taken to catch some of then in Saint Louis. The troops that remain should be regulars. You did not answer my dispatch about Stolbrand's brigade and the infantry regiment to relieve Sully's command. An infantry regiment, if started soon, can get to Fort Randall on boats. I don't suppose cavalry can be wintered up there on account of lack of forage. I was informed to-day that the Fourth U. S. Volunteers had gone up into that country. I know very little about Missouri River posts, having got no reports from them. I leave here to-morrow for Fort Kearny. Dispatches sent to Omaha will be forwarded to me.

OMAHA, August 12, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis:

I am astonished at what you state. You must be aware that there was no truth in it, as you had full statement of everything that had been done or that was contemplated. General Meigs must have been aware that I gave orders at Fort Leavenworth cutting down requisitions largely, and in some cases entirely. These orders I made direct on depot commissary of subsistence and quartermaster, and ordered that no more supplies be sent to the plains except by my order. The reduction of troops to 5,000 men on the plains this fall came after supplies had been forwarded in accordance with the plans presented to you and by you to General Grant, which he instructed you to carry out. I supposed that we should have to keep about 10,000 men, and would make arrangements accordingly. The number of troops on the plains
