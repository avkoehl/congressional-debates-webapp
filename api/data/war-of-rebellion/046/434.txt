out of them last night. The banquette on the rear front has not been begun.

The infantry force on the island is 1,037; the artillery force on the island in 239.

No firing on Battery Gregg was made during the last night, nor any this morning until about 10 a.m. when the enemy's battery to the right of Gregg's Hill opened apparently on the Sullivan's Island steamer, all the shots falling short. This afternoon the same battery fired at same object, with same result.

At 5.30 p.m., a wooden gunboat fired a few shot, all falling short of Battery Gregg.

Our sharpshooters from Battery Wagner have been actively employed all day, and seem to annoy the enemy, eliciting at intervals the usual reply of howitzer shells.

Respectfully submitted.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
