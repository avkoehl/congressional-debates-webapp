(Via Jackson River.)

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dublin:

General Imboden reports enemy advancing up the Valley, and says signal corps reports them at McDowell; asks me to move to Millborough, if my orders will permit. No movements in Greenbrier this way; shall I move as requested? If they at McDowell, I should be at least at the Cow Pasture bridge or at Millborough.

W. L. JACKSON,

Colonel.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Beverly has not been re-enforced, and there is no movement from Greenbrier. At the request of General Imboden, I am now moving to the Depot; am I right in so doing, and shall I go to Millborough? Please give me orders. I keep scouts to Greenbrier.

WM. L. JACKSON,

Colonel.
