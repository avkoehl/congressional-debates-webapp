course, and wien an individual who has a claim
on the Government for provis ons furnished lo the
army, or for any oihei service, calls for his money,
■we tell him we cannot pav ior «ant of funds, but
we give him our note, pa}able at the end of a
year He is not obh0ed lo take ihi He has a
right to demand gold or silver, but he "Hill lake the
note lti ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, for by
calling upon an) bank or merch int that ones the
Government, he can get money or currency for his
note that will answer hi purpose wheic he resides
For example the deposite banks in Cn cmnati
w ould buy h s note and giv c him their paper,
which, in common busine s, would answei him as
veil as sp c e The bank vv ould send in the note
to the Treasury, and get cieJit ior th it amount in
their dealings with the Government We do in
this case vhat an honest man does m his o«n af-
faiis We settle, and not ha\ mg the money, we
give our note tor the amount due , and our cieditor
eithei holds the note till it becomes due, oi he trules
it off ioi propeity or cash, as, may best suit his
own convenience or ínteres!
By the time our notes are d„t, we shall ul able
to lift them, with the money ptad in b the banks
and the merchants, and from the tmr^nt receipts
into the Treasury from duties and pjbnc lands,
we will have relieved both Government and people
by thus using our credit, the debts due to us will
be paid without distressing anj one and our paper
will be íedee npd The measuie is, therefore, a
salutary one It has been *ned before, especially
during Ihe last w ar it should not be resulted to
upon light oi tr vial occasions, but when the pub-
lic interests íequire it, i o one should hesitate to
lend his support to a course of policy wh ch is both
safe and beneficial
The Sub Treas in s em as it is called seems
to have exeinu moie aiimi mi"ildin quaiteis,
than any othei piopos ion befoie us It is said
we are about to cut loose Irom the banks, to turn
them adrift lo tal > care i f the^s-lves, and to be
dm en about by wind and tide till they arc wrecked
upon some dangerous coast, or lost amidst the
conflict of elements which the) will be forced to
encounter Is thi t-ue1 Are we about to cut
loose from banks'? AVhy, sir, they have cu'
loose from us They have divorced them-
selves or rather they have eloped from our
bed and bond, without just caí se or piovoca-
tion and have enrol of all the no ley and
jewellery they coi'd find abeut the house,
at the time of their e'ooem°rt All that we say is,
that, it they attempt to leturn we shall shut the
doors upon them and m the meantime, give no-
tice that we will pay no debts of their contracting
after this dat ' I' ah} man fjbts them, it will be
his affau, and not ours This is oji position, and
it i, nothing mo'e nor le s The., have left us,
and not we them , and w e 1 ave no di position lo

State authorities
We have heard much íecendy about ' two cui-
tencies—one foi the Government, and the other jor the
people" Sof.r as such 1 nguage has been used
here, I will not call it mueiable neuspaper ¡tang,
though in another sense it is so, for we see it daily
in the party newspapers of die (oui try I consider
it a most pititul paity subterfuge, to alarm the pub-
lic mind, and eieate prejudices among the people
in regard tj the system of collecting and keeping
the public money now proposed, before time has
been given to eximine its principles and details
Two currencies' Why, the Administration does
not propose to eieate one cuireney, much les* two
It makes no tuireney, the Constitution his done
that We propose to aduere to the Constitution
Does any one object to th if! The revenues are to
be collected in money, oi,fora time, parity in
money, and partly m piper equivalent to i!, and,
ultimately, if jou please, m hard money If ?ny
man is opposed to tnis, let him quarrel with the
Constituí on Does the Government claim more
than private citizens' Has not eveiy man a risht
lo specie in payment of his debts'! Is my one
bcund to take paper' If a citizen his land to sell,
is he bound to lake anv thing but specie for il, it
he choose to ask th it and lo leluse paper' Have
not the whole people tne right to do what each one
cando1 Whit do we mean by the Govt rninent"
You mem the peisons w ho happen lo be m office at
this Imie—thosevvho now administer tne Govern-
ment Theyare but the te npoiaiy a ikofthepeo-
ple, and ihey will collect revenue in whatever the
people dnect It is no affau of the individual agents
It is the people's business, and is for the benefit of
the whole country Gentlemen talk about the
Government as they would in England, wheie the
Go-' ernment of King and nobles may hive a dis-
tinct and separate mteiest from that of the people
Hexe the interests ire the same The people de-
cide, through Congress in what their federal leve-
nue shall be received they decide, through the
Slate Legislatures in what their State revenue
shall he taken mil they then decide e^en man for
himself in what his own revenue shall be collect-
ed, and what kind of money, or bank paper, he
w ill receive from those w ho owe h m Away w ith
all sucn trash then, about " one currency for the
Government, and ano'her for the people " It is
unworthy to be either propigated or listened to,
by any man of enlightened understanding
Those who assume to be ihe esp"c al fuends of
the State banks complain that the General Gov ern-
ment Ins lost confidence in them, and has changed
its ground in regnd to the system of depositories
The ca'e is a plain one The banks have failed
to perfotm their engagements ihev hive violated
men contracts with the Government ihey have
got em money and cannot pay it out to meet tie
w ai ts of the public The s stem ha piachcalty,
filled to answer the purposes fti which it was
adopted INow although the banks may hav°
been honest, md miy have been driven to this

bank  can lesume specie pa>menls, v ho have ^.n>  j
papei in calculation, until the dram of s| ecie to
Lurope is stopp d When is that to be' Specie is
now vvoith m Engl?nd only three per cent interest
On %iush seemities, plenty of it can be had at that
rate No one will deny this Througn the agency
e f his British stockho'dei s, Mr Bi Idle can get what
money he wants Suppose he wLre to nego-
tiate a Icn of ten or twenty millions in
London , enabling him to diaw bdls lo that
ai umni, bung down the exchange to par, and
tnereby slop the expoitation of specie at
once Everybody knows that he can do this it
he will He could then iesume specie payment
al once md holuing the exchange of the countiy
m his ov/n hands, he could contiol the othei banks
w ho w ould, or w ouid not, resume at the same time,
as he might dnect Without his approbation, they
would have to wait till the foreign debt was ar-
ranged through la* mea is Then the dram would
b= stopped, and they could resume in <pite of him.
But in the rnteiva', under our law, he would re-
sume specie payments, and demand the public de-
positee Who could prevent his getting them"!
He would inevitably obtain them undei such a pro-
vision, and those who may advocate this policy,
whalevei may be their pmposes, aie, in reality,
playing into Ihe hands of the United Slates Bank
Let them bew are of ihis, lest the seed they now
sow should heieafter pioduce a harvest of public
calamity and mdi\ nlual mortification
I shall not pause to diseu«s the'menls of theSub-
Tieasiuy system It will be time enough to do that
when the bi'l conies before the House for its action
But I nust say, m passing, that it is amnsing to
see the sibttifuges to which the opposition ars
driven, to keep up a clamor For jears past lh?y
have been abusing the Executive branch of the
Government foi having seized the sword and the
puise, foi having usurped all powei, and trampled
upon ihe Constitution, and especially, for having
added an enormous amount of power and influence
to what it formerly possessed, by its control over
nenly one hundred deposite banks All the piesi-
denls, cashiers, stockholders, and borrowers were
supposed to be under Executive control, forming a
large armj, to enter the fields with millions of mo-
ney, at every election' Now, whit do wt hear"! The
banks hay e separated from the Government What-
ever influence the Executive ever possessed over them
ísgone Itispioposedby the President not to employ
anv such agencies in future, but to let the money re-
main in the hands of the collecting officers, who
are to pay it out as it is wanted It is not pro-
posed, by the bill before us, to increase the num-
ber of officers at all There may be a few moie
clerks wanted, but the mciease is too trifling to
be named Here is the Executive, endeavoring to
keep clear of his old "aimy of dependants," and to
our uttei astonishment, the opposition are trying to
Joi ce them upon him' Theyare abusing him for
trying to get rid of this very patronage which they
hav e so much deprecated in past time What con-
nitcnai th ie is in ihe public course of these gen-
tlemen' Let the President do what he will, they
opp s-i 1 un If he has patronage, they abuse him
f ir i i* 1 pr p >ses to abandon it they abuse him
fe bit I he remains «dent, ihey quarre' with
him neciust he does not speak out and let the
country know w it he thmks If he gives his
view s upon i que i on and suggests a course with
