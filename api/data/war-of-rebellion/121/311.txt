ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR:

Please have an officer sent to ascertain and report condition of returned prisoners in regard to subsistence, pay, transportation, &amp;c., the progress made in executing orders touching their furloughs, and what is done for their shelter, &c. There is so much complaint from Congressmen, Legislatures, and other sources (no doubt exaggerated) that it may become necessary to answer them. I would like to have the report this evening if possible.

J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War.

P. S. - An officer has been sent, through directions given to secretary of the bureau, to look after complaints about sick and wounded between here and Varina.

Brigadier-General GARDNER, Commanding:

The Department is informed that prisoners that have lately arrived are sick and in the most wretched condition. Have a special examination and report of their condition, and ascertain, as far as practicable, how they happen to be in such a condition.

If need be, call upon the Adjutant-General for an intelligent inspecting officer. Have relief granted to them and as much consideration shown as is practicable.

By order:

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Secretary of War.
