Brigadier-General BROWN, Jefferson City, Mo.:

Instruct our cavalry to attack fiercely the advance parties of the enemy. They are never very large and always far in advance of the main body. Have this well understood. Impress upon them the necessity of handling them roughly. They go ahead to pick up and prepare the way for the main army.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

JEFFERSON CITY, September 30, 1864-11.15 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The superintendent railroad reports the enemy at Cuba. They will probably cut the lines before morning. Have you any instructions to give me except to fight? I am doing all I can to intrench my position, and shall put all the transportation I can on the north side of the river and shall send a cavalry force to retard the advance of the enemy so as to gain time for re-enforcements to arrive. I shall have about 2,500 effective when all have arrived.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 30, 1864-11.58 p. m.

General E. B. BROWN, Jefferson City:

Nothing to add to former instructions, save that Mower from Arkansas is close on the enemy's heels, and we shall soon be upon [him] in overwhelming force. You are doing right. Instruct cavalry as directed this morning to strike their advance sharp and hard. You can whip all they can bring against you. Fisk will be there soon.
