move to the relief of General McCook I doubt if he would attempt it. General Stoneman went with a full knowledge of his risk but General McCook will have reason to expect co-operation from about McDonough, and may be disappointed when he finds his brigade gone and a new road ahead closed by Wheeler. He has, however, a bold and well-appointed force and can fight his way back; still, for his sake, we must occupy the attention of the enemy as much as possible.

General THOMAS and HOWARD:

A cavalryman, just in, says General Garrard is coming in by the Peach Tree road; had a small fight first day, none since. says General Stoneman has gone on, so that branch of the raid seems to be doing well. I now want news of General McCook. As soon as General Garrard comes I will order some cavalry down the west bank of the Chattahoochee to see to General McCook's bridge. Though the heat is intense, the time is for a bold reconnaissance and threat about East Point.

Generals THOMAS and HOWARD:

I am just back from an interview with General Schofield. General Garrard is back. He was sent by General Stoneman to Flat Rock, where he was surrounded by Wheeler's cavalry, but he remained two days, expecting General Stoneman to sent him orders, when he broke out to Latimar's where he heard General Stoneman had gone to Covington and beyond. Not having further orders he came home via the Peach Tree road. His fight was a small affair, losing only 1 officer and 6 men wounded, and riding down one brigade of the enemy. He thinks Wheeler still remains on the right of Atlanta, extending the infantry line. I think General Stoneman has gone to Macon, east of Yellow River, and that it is well. I have ordered General Garrard in on our left, and to-morrow night will let him fill with a skirmish line General Schofield's position, and move all of General Schofield to the right of General Howard, and with the division of Generals Davis and Ward in reserve on the right to strike a blow beyond our new right flank when intrenched. Our right flank must be advanced in close and absolute contact with the enemy, and with General Schofield on that flank I think we can make him quit Atlanta, or so weaken his lines that we can break through somewhere, the same as our Kenesaw move. Study the road so that General Schofield and Howard may have a line close up to the enemy, as close as possible. I will send a regiment of cavalry down the west bank of the Chattahoochee to feel for General McCook. I must have a bolder commander for General Garrard's cavalry and want General Thomas to name to me General Kilpatrick or some good brigadier for the command.
