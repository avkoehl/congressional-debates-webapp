staff and of Brigadier-General Cheatham's staff, and of the general staff on duty with me in this army.* I include in this list the quartermast and commissary on depot duty at Memphis, who are still supplying my want in their names are mentioned, the list as it is prepared giving correctly their relative rank as given by the governor of Tennessee.

An opportunity being afforded me in this reply to your dispatch, I will advise you of the strength of the forces under my command and of the different arms of the service, supposing that the President would be pleased to have this information. I have of all arms abut 10,000 men. Two thousand of these are Missourians, badly armed. the balance of these are Tennesseeans, and abut 600 Mississippians. The Tennesseans and Mississippians are well armed. I have two six-gun, one four-gun, and one five-gun battery and two siege guns with me, together with a good supply of ammunition for all. I have thrown forward my advance to Benton, 40 miles from this place, and within 15 miles of Cape Girardeau, where we expect to engage the enemy. In that section of the country I expect to unite my force with Brigadier-General Hardee, who has only about 4,500 men all told. When we meet, from his rank, he will take command of the whole, unless in courtesy he allows me to command, which is not probable. I have made a great effort to get this force in the field, to arm it, and procure munitions for its use. Indeed, nearly all the arms and munitions of war held by the State were gathered together and procured by myself, at an expense of $200,000 in cash, raise don my private resources, which has not been reimbursed me by Tennessee. With he facts before you, and with my past history and services tot he country, with which I presume you to be familia, you can judge with what reluctance I yield the command to an officer who was a captain under me in the Mexican war while I was a major-general. Why is it that I have been place din position and ranked by nearly every general officer of the Confederate Army when it is known that I ranked every officer now in that Army in my long term of the service in the Mexican war, in which service General Scott's in every trial? Why this is I know not, but the facts are as I state them. I do not address you this letter in the way of complaint, but in my present position and rank it is certain that but little can be effected by me. I do not feel that i can render to the country services at all commensurate with the public expectations. I shall continue to perform my duty as best I can, whatever may be the result.

I expect to engage the enemy at Cape Girardeau. He is there in force, and is fortifying his position day and night. He has removed most of his forces from Cairo and Bird's Point to Saint Louis and the Cape. My advance upon the Cape is difficult, on account of the forces at Cairo and the point being on my flank. I have, however, no other route upon which I can advance. I am now throwing forward my ordnance and subsistence stores, and will move the rear of the force from this place on the day after to-morrow. I would have been off some time since but for my shortness of transportation and for General Polk's orders and varying views and countermanding orders, repeatedly made, thus crippling my operations and movements.

With respect,

GID. J. PILLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
