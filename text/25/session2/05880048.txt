ration that the j-rayers of the kicked avail not,
how far this declaration may apply to the gentle-
man's case I Know not, it is sufficient for me to kn< w
that we are enjoying tempm i1 happiness beyond any
people on the face ol the eaifh, and that thuene\ei
was a grealei abundance of all the oomfoits of lile
in our country, at any out ume, than we now en-
joy, fer which, I tiust, we all tccl that thankful-
neso and gratitude, which become the people ot a
civih/ed and chusiian nation, to the Giver o' ill
Good But the member no sooner finishes his tie
votional exercises thin he de r's the Pre ident,
and denounces his message as "a pom thing,"
a "poor neglected thmg," a Loco Foco document,
and the author of it a ule demagogue In rela-
tion to the quality oí the Message, Mi D had
come to a different conclusion, and hi was happy
to say he was not alme in th it opinion He had
that morning lecived several letters irom hia
luends that he had the licuor lo íepiesent who e
talents and whose cipacitv, to judje m these imi-
téis would atleast compare with the member's, who
united in their commenda icns as well ol the mei-
sures recomrnent'ed m it as ih" tiur F.ipubl can
principles it contains he had also íeccivid sevei il
i spectable newspapers Irom vanous 'ecuons ol
the State he had the honoi m pait to icpiesent, all
ot which concuiied in the same high opinion of
the Message ' But it was a pool neglected thing '
How neglected'' Not by the people Every hour fur
nished intelligence that it was hailed by the fr end
of equal rights and the supporters of the C institution
When, then, cr how, has it been neglected^ Not
by the House, for it hal its atteitt->i is s on as
its business would admit—<0 sot n as tue commit-
tees were formed and lepo- ed the appropriate re-
lerences were commenced to he made, and that
would be continued as fastas the vmdictiveness
and lustihty ol the Opposition would permit who
so ^ar seem determined, at all hazaid, and at any
expense, lo cripple the administra! on and obstruct
the regulai course of bus ne-s in this House The
member, after denouncing the whole Message m
these general terms, takes it up by parts and
denounces it Prom page ninth, he reads "On that
occasion (meaning and referring to the extra ses-
sion) three modes of performing this branch of the
public service (meaning the safe-keeping snd
transfer of the public moneys)  were proposed'" j
Heie the member slopped shoit, gave us one othis
wondtous wise looks, in which he mnnifested great
astonishment and suipuse, denounced the state-
ment of the Pitsident as Jalse, and asked ernphati-
cahv, and with an an ol appaient triumph and
defiance,' « ho w ill oi dare say that there were three
piopositions foi such a puipose piesented to Con-
gress at the extra session?" "Who in this House," he
repeated, "dare assert such a thing " I dare assert
it, (said Mr D ) and 1 date as^eit it without the
fear ot successful contradiction liom anv man
fiom any quariei He said he had heiid mem-
bers before use the word date in a wiong and im-
pioper manner To say a member date not do a
thing, was using language that could not be carried
out It was too strong an expression There were
members here w ho dare say any thing that truth, jus-
tice, and moral principle did not piohibit Mi D
said lie had surveyed most oi the member* ol ti c
House, he, with his eye, measuied their length,
their treadth, then encumference, and then dia
metti, and, more pailicularly, the eye, which was
the index to the heart and he had '■ecu nothmg in
the shapi ot a modem Whig that ought, foi a mo-
ment, to deter a man irem siynganv thing He
repeated, that he dare say there were Ihiee pioposi-
tions befoie Congress at the extia session, for the
sate keeping uid the transier of the public moneys,
all of which received the attention and the action
oi Congress, and this, too, he dare say on his own
responsibility, without even turning to the jour-
nals The fiist proposition he would name was the
Sub Treasury sjstem, (usually so called,) recom-
mended by the President in his message The
second was a ptoposition made by a small part)
heie, called the Conserialwei, which was, in the
language of the President's Mes-zige, "the levival,
with modifications, of the d> posite s\stcm esta-
blished by the act of the 23d ol June, 183(>," etc
an! the thud proposition was a nationil bank,
none of which can be sud lo have received the
definite action of Congress except the last named
pioposmor, and that, it is hoped, got its last and
lmal sentence, ami everlasting doom, by a large
majority pi both brinches, so I thiovv back the
charge ol falsehood upen the member fiom Vn-
ginia
When the member finished h daring and ban-
tering tirade, he amusid hinsili ind lis friends

lary They take a name for political effect The}
ask to be known bv it o long as it « ill answer that
purpose or until it is degrukl The last name
bj which  hey ask lo be known, is 'Whig ' not
that they possess anv of the political prm íples of
the patriots of 7b, who were known by that name,
and which was at that time, and leally is now, sy-
nonymous with "Democrat"
The term Whig m the United States at this time
is significant of Federalist m %, a teim that the
self-named Whigs of this day were then prond of,
1 ut then principles are sun the same Of this
truth we have some practical demonstrations We
are all avaie of a sanguinary war now raging on
our borders m the Cañadas The patriots of
Canada have snuffed the breezes from our conb
neat, and caught trie spmt of liberty which we
njoy They have, in the language of our gallant
ncestois, pledged their lives, their fortunes, and
their vicred honor, m the cause of fieedam, and
are now battltngfor independence.
The citizens of the United States have taken
sides, (in feeling and sptrtt ) You find the Demo-
cracy on the side of the patriot?, who are there
called Whigs and the modern Whigs you find on
the side of the tools of aristocracy and the minions
of royalty, there called Tones. I hold in my hand
one of the most respectable bank organs and Fede-
tal sheets perhaps in the United States, bearing no
less title at its head than National Intelligencer,
w hich contains a long article (and favotably re-
t eived too) denouncing the patriots oí Canada as
i adical- , disturbers of the peace, agrarians, elc and
in character with the Fanny Wrights and the Loco
Focos of the. United States Then, si , we find that
(he Whigs of this country are the Tories oi Canada,
and the Whigs ot Canada ire the Democracy of
this country This is as it always has been, and
as it will continue to be I hope now that I am
undei^tood that, when I speak of the modern Whigs
as d paity, I mean the same party governed by
the same puneiples that characterized the Federal
party in '96, and who were known by that name
But to return to Whig victories and Whig glory.
1 w ould advise the Whigs to use their glory spa-
ringly I fear they are too prodigal of it They ought
to use it that it may last until next fall, for then the
people w ill make them sing glory to the tune of
" Burns's Adieu " I think the experience and
history of our country furnishes us with but three
Whig victories One of these was in the year 1796,
a triumph over the principles of Democracy that
w ill be long remembered, and can only be lost
with the hiatory of our country, a triumph that let
loose the foul waters of Federalism to the inunda-
t ion of the best prospects of productive liberty
This Whig victory gave birth to the alien and sedi-
tion laws, that constitute, tothis day, and ever will,
a foul and black spot upon the American statute
book, which, though they tarnish the proud cha-
lartci ol our free institutions, serve as an impe-
nshable dixit that, great and good as is our political
labue, and great as were the sacrifices of life, blood,
and pioperty by which it was purchased, it is but a
human institution, and to preseive it requires
nothing short of the vigilance and patriotism that
wrested it from the hand of tyranny
I think the next Whig victory is to be found in
the chronicles of 1824 This was a most glorious
victory, inasmuch as it was a victory over popular
sufT-age It was worth all the oth r victories put
together It was a wctoiy of ihe aristocracy
of wealth over the democracy ot nurabeis True,
it was obtained in direct violation of the spirit and
meaning of oui Constitution, m the abuse of our
free institutions, and m the lace and name, and
nature ol out Government, but this did not make
the vic'oiy the less glorious with those who can.
stretch the Constitution to the exte t of their own
wishes The glory of this victory lasted four years,
and was not unlike a Bacchanalian feast for that
length of time, but the people, true to their com-
mon country when it is in dangei, rallied in their
majesty to the polls, arid swept from the chess-
board the political workers of iniquity of that day,
and with them their glory
We now come to the victories of 1837, to which
the gentleman has been so long and so loud sing-
ing glory, as "ted by those of his friends who could
join in the choius, and those who could not, done
their part by looking effect to the best advantage
fen, il justice to the subject would peimit, I would
not for a moment disturb the member and bis
friends in th°pnjoymentsofthe i supposed vieWies,
but I feel bound to make some expositions in
relation to the recent elections The member, m
his ecstacies, makes some assertions that the true 3 e-
sults of the recent elections will not bear him out in
He tells us in his shouts of joy that the people
have risen in their strength Irom Mame to Mis-
sissippi, and denounced the President and his Loco
Foco Sub-Treasury scheme I suppose he has re-
ference to the result ef the elections m Maine,
New York, and Mississippi As all this display of
victory and glory is for home consumption ana
paity effect, it is a duty I owe to the cause, sad the
party I support, to give some statistics that will
present these elections in a diffeient light    Maine
