OFFICE COMMISSARY - GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., October 12, 1863.

Brigadier General G. MARSTON,

Commanding Depot Prisoners of War, Point Lookout, Md.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 8th,* containing plan and estimate for barracks at Point Lookout, is received, and will be immediately laid before the Secretary of War. I do not agree recommending one room without windows, 100 feet by 35, to receive 700 men. I am satisfied, from my own experience and the reports of medical officers, that a building 100 feet by 24, with three tiers of bunks, will accommodate 150 men, and not more. I have ordered 1,000 prisoners from Fort Delaware to Point Lookout, and will order as many more, perhaps 2,000, as soon as I can have tents sent down.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary - General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY - GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., October 12, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st and 6th instant. You must except that the prisoners will frequently discuss the chances of escape from the island, and make plans and threats to accomplish what they so much desire, and they will make effort if ever an inviting opportunity offers. But the difficulties in the way are very great, independent of the guard, and so long as it is vigilant and prepared there is no danger that the prisoners will sacrifice so many lives, as they must do in any such desperate attempt, when, even if they should overcome the, their final escape would be so doubtful. I do not feel at liberty either to ask for additional companies or for the presence of the statement Michigan. I have heard of the attempted escape of three prisoners by sawing off one of the pickets. If you think it advisable, cover the picketing on the inside with boards, and pay for it out of the prison fund. You must exercise your own judgment in the matter of overcoats in particular cases. Those who have a good supply of outer clothing should not be permitted to receive a greatcoat. They can keep themselves warm by remaining in the house. There is no objection to their receiving a reasonable number of blankets, not shawls.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary - General of Prisoners.

MOBILE, October 12, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:

Acting Master Myers crew, under orders from Admiral Buchanan, captured the Leviathan in Mississippi River, but were afterward recaptured by the enemy and are in irons in New Orleans. Shall I retaliate on the officers whom I have?

D. H. MAURY,

Major - General.
