On the 21st we marched to the vicinity of Charlestown, driving the enemy's cavalry from the Opequon, meeting the infantry about 9 a. m. at Cameron Station and driving them toward Charlestown, in front of which we had some severe skirmishing and also shelled the enemy's sharpshooters at Packett's house. The troops were disposed as in plate ---.* The enemy fortified their lines (see plate ---*). Vaughn's, Johnson's, and Jackson's brigades advanced to Leetown and then crossed to the vicinity of Charlestown (see plate ---+). Part of McCausland's brigade followed the enemy's cavalry from the Opequon to Summit Point. The rest covered the advance and formed on Rodes' left. Fitz Lee, advancing by Berryville, engaged the enemy on that road, while Anderson drove them on the Summit Point road (see plate ---+). We encamped near Cameron. August 22, the enemy retired last night and we drove their cavalry pickets through Charlestown and established our line beyond it, with cavalry on both flanks, Fitz Lee on the right and Lomax on the left. Anderson came to the vicinity (see plate ---+). We remained near the same position on the 23rd and 24th, moving somewhat to the left along the Leetown road (see plate ---+). The enemy drove in our pickets on the 24th, but we repulsed them. August 25, marched for Shepherdstown via Leetown, Wharton in front, and met the advance of the enemy's cavalry on the march, about two miles from Leetown, and had quite a heavy skirmish and artillery duel with them, driving them from their position (see plate ---#). They made another stand nearer to Shepherdstown, where we engaged them until dark, driving them several miles, some crossing the Potomac and some going toward Harper's Ferry (see plate ---#). We encamped near Shepherdstown, the cavalry divisions of Fitz Lee and Lomax collected at Leetown via Smithfield, and went to Williamsport via Martinsburg (see plate ---+). Anderson remained in front of Charlestown, with McCausland on his left and --- on his right.

On the 26th the army marched back to Leetown, Ramseur in advance. The cavalry came to Shepherdstown after an artillery fight across the Potomac at Williamsport (see plate ---+). The enemy made an attack on Anderson at Charlestown in the p. m. August 27, marched to the old camps at Bunker Hill, Rodes moving by "thee Bower." The rest, Ramseur in advance, by Smithfield. Anderson marched via Smithfield and Brucetown to Stephenson's. The cavalry that had been left at Charlestown came to Smithfield, but was ordered back. The rest of it remained at Shepherdstown (see plate ---+). On the 28th, the enemy's cavalry advanced on ours and compelled it to cross the Opequon. After a brisk engagement at Smithfield, which place the enemy occupied and burned barns and houses, Fitz Lee retired toward Brucetown and Lomax toward Bunker Hill. Ramseur was marched toward the Opequon, but did not cross (see plate ---+). The 29th the enemy advanced across the Opequon, driving in our cavalry. Our infantry was advanced, as in plate ---,$ and, aided by the artillery, drove them back across the Opequon and from some rude works they had constructed in front of Smithfield (see plate ---$), and then returned to camp, leaving the cavalry behind, but the enemy
