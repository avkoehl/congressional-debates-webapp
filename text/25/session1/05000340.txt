Postponement of fourth instalment.—Mr, Adams.

arid Connecticut," Mr Speak * [Laugh j And I am sull m
the daik as to th* meaning of that line in the report of the Se
Cretary, which seems to maio  Massaclisnts responsible ior a
yet iargershawofthe public treasure than, in her own proper
place in the report, sh« 19  ot down aa holding in deposit  And
this is the more remarkable, because in this same statement
appended to the Secretary's repoi t, the Hank of the Metropolis
in this city has its proper place aftei wards between the banks
of the State of Maryland and those of the Stats of Virginia, and
therefore cannot naturally be supposed to be the same "Metro
polis special" thus thrust up in a corner between the States of
Maine and of Connecticut It ail g es to corroborate the idea
that this same report of th# Secretary of the Treasury is far
from being so explicit and intelligible to all, as it is to those
gentlemen whose sagacity find  it so easy te be understood
Besides, sir, I find m this Treasurer's weekly statement of the
amount to his credit, m the various banks of public deposite,
the Bank of the Metropolis, District of Columbia, m its proper
place, located between Maryland and Virginia, with a small ba
lance of $2,162 83centséue to th Treaamei,and that whole
sura, except $9 and 4cent m thecolnmnof wanants hereto
fore drawn, but not y« paid, though payable And in the
statement marked ÍC, this same Bank of the Metropolis is in
eluded in a list of deposite banks discontinued under the (lépe-
nte act of June, 1830 And it is not included in the list of pre
sent deposite banks under the same act, marked L In the cir
cular^letterof the Secretary to the delinquent banks, I find it
written "Th  imperative piovisionsof the act of June, 183b,
make it the duty of this Depaitment to discontinue ordering
any further sums of public money to b  placed with the depo
site banks after suspending specie payments, and hence you are
notified that no more can be thus deposited m youi institution,
provided such a failure to redeem your notes Üas actually oc
curred "
"No more can be thus deposited in your institution " The
HankoftheMetropohs,inthe District ot •olumbia, is one of the
deposite banks discontinued by the positive command ef the
law, bat "Metropolis special," between Mame and Connecti
cut, ha1? a deposite dated the 28th of August, of §140,541 62cts
By what authority was that deposite made? This 11 to me one
of those unintelligible things in the report of the Seciet-uyof
the Treasury, which I should be glad to see explained I  it a
practical illustration of the divorce between bank and State? or
of the locomotive power ot th Secietaiy to transport the Me
iropohs from the District of Columbia to Massachusetts, to
New Hampshire, to Rhode Island, to some undefined region be
tween Mame and Counecticut, where he could make a special
deposite of geld without infringing upon "the impeiative pro
visions of the act of June, 18301"
I should like to know why this item is thus thrust between
Mame and Connecticut, as if it were intended to give Massichu
setts the Aeputation of having $140,000 of the money which is
used to pay members of t^Origress and the navy yard«xpenseB at
New York?
But I was observing upon the profound philosophical arid
geographical statement submitted to the House by the gentío
man from South Carolina, (Mr Thompson,) in which it was as
sorted that the money of the United States " always flows to the
North " Now t havegiven the House one example, m the case
of Alabama Let us look ft little farther here 1 find the Union
Bank of Louisiana and the Bank of New Oilcans have, together,
an amount nearly equal to &l,500,000 Here is a million and a
half flowing to that extiemity of the North, New Oi leans and
hcreis upwards of one million soven hundred thousand dollar1!
flowing into the deposite banks of the State of Mississippi at
Natcher Now, with the utmost respect for the States of Loum
ana and Mississippi, they are not so near to the north pole, that
they should have between tht m more than three millions of
United States money, which the gentleman from South Carolina
«wis  is always flowing to the North—money which is, m fact,
a. gift bestowed upon them without law, at least not by law, but
by tht oppratmn of a specie circulai, which requiied all pay
mentó to them to bo made in gold and silver, and yet tliev hive
not a dollar ioi incoming I will put the interest on this specie
it ten per 1 ent, six percent js certainly too little The use of
these depObitCb wouldbe'worth six per cent even if they might
he calledaway at any moment I will put the interest at ten
pei cent Here, then, we have placed at the disposal of the
banks of Louisiana $1,500,000, which I say is equivalent to a
pure donation to that State of®Í50O(J0a year, so long as tne de
polite shall continue And how goes it with the State of Miosis
sippi? I find hero that the Plantéis' Bank and branches, Isat
chez, have #895,000, and the Agticultural Bank and bits ches
Natchez, S849 000, making $1,744 00) Here is an a tualb on
to that State of 174,C00 They have had this since July alieat v
antl they will continue to have it until it suits their conveniens
to pav it over, which I hope they will ¿o before the 1st oj Janu
ary, 1839
Well, I am, notwithstanding, willing to vote for this bi'I
leaving this mattei as it is, provided the banks of Alabama and
J ouisiana and Mississippi will pay back this money on 01 be
foie the 1st of January, 1839
We come next to the State of Tennessee Her share is but
small, amounting to not over $tOO,000 li she was entitled to
receive hei share of the deposites on the 1st of October, bhc
might set off th it amount, and suffer no injury She would
then have the use of this money, and would «till get her poi
tionof the deposites like the other Slates Then we come to
Ohio ami, in respect to hei, it seems to be admitted as a settled
nfTii , that all hei banks are good and sound, only their notes
will not command the specie without a little premium of ten
percent Ohio has got #900,000 Slip ir a lartie State ~nd, m
the critical condition of her politic*!, may have been thoushta
cheap purchase at this amount It is not, at any la'e, a ve-v
extiavagant (=um Indiana has a aiire pouion Butntreth n,
is anniher'Northwaid flowing" of a different kind He e  \e
come to a ¡state hardly a year old It is hardly a year «unce we
\-\ere diicmsinghcr admission into the Union, and if she was
rut satisfied with the conduct of the Government (hen, 1 think
at leistshe must bo now Here is Michigan with more than
one million  f dollars, which is cqml to a clear donttion of
WKI000 Dops the geography of the gentlem 111 trim Sou h
Carolina consider Michigan as a place to wl ich the mono of
the United States flows Nonhwaid? AD this vast tide of spe
cie, according to mv geography, has flowed Southwud and
Westward As to the Vnth, the flowing in that ducc ion ha<?
been m a precious small nil
What is the conclusion from these facts7   The gentleman
from Creoigia (Mi Dawson) complained that Georgia b d not
had liar portion and he didhti justice to his own hii     if v/e
consider what ha-, been gMien to Alabama and Mi* si wp -11

which is all they owe7 I wilt not ask how many good friends
oí the Administran >n have been made, or how many p ou^us
votes m this House secured, by this system of operations When
we came to make this deposite, I moan the deposite by Uw I
remember well the arguments of gentlemen who wanted a dii
ferent standard of distribution adopted 1 hey complained @f a
distribution according to the íatio of representation in both
Houses of Congiess because it gave too much to Delaware, to
Rhode island, and other ¡?naail States Now, sir, it was not the
Noithem States but tht email, and the Western States chiefly,
which got this extia proportion I was willing they should
have it, because, since the last census was taken, their popula
tiou hadiocieased much moie than that of Massachusetts I
assented to this latiobecause the new States, who were most m
want of money, would be most benefited by it and I voted foi
the bill But the very interest which the members took on that
occ \ajon m this question, and the earnestness with which the>
nig ed tne ntcessity of an equal principle pioted the earncát
riPt.s with which every membei of the House adheied to the
Iiaporfional right oí his own State
But what was that ía 10 of d stubUion ¡n com} anson to this?
When £1 500000 is given to one teta c?   Alabima had five
ncmbeisin the House anl two in tht Senate, Massachusetts
had twelve mthp House and two m the senate    Then propor-
tions, were, thei c 'oro   ls 7 to 11    1 u this I as ented    But what
is the proportion here?   Alabama gets $1,500,000 and Massa
chusetts $80,000    I sav nothing about Pennsylvania    She is
one of the largest States in the Union, and she has $249 000 m
the Guard Bank, &5 500 in the Moyamensmg Bank  but of this
sum tnere has already been drawn, upon the Girard Bank, in
w mums not j et paid, though paj able, gl603000, leaving only
about 1>9> 000 as the share of actual deposite held byPennsyl
\ania    Bur, when weconsidei the papulation ofPemisylvama

$1 700 000 to Misei sippi?                                                     '
