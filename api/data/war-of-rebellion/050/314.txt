HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 26, 1863.

GENERAL: Immediately after retaking the battery of your brigade, the Ninth Ohio Volunteers were ordered to the left of their brigade, which the rebels had attacked in considerable force, leaving the battery in charge of the Seventeenth Ohio Volunteers.

This regiment remained in charge of the battery until it was known you had sent a regiment to receive it, when, there being no rebels in the vicinity, the Seventeenth Ohio Volunteers hurried to the left, where their service were much needed.

Very respectfully,J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

General KING,

First Division.
