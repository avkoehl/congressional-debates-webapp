yet organized. Captain Brownson, of my staff, was mortally wounded, dying during the night. Colonel Walker, assistant adjutant-general, is missing. It is acknowledged to have been one of the most determined and desperate fights of the war, resembling Spotsylvania in its character, through the number of engaged gives it less importance. A few more good troops would have given us a victory of considerable importance. I forward this morning prisoners from Field, Wilcox, and Heth. Major Angel, of my staff, saw and conversed with two prisoners of Mahone's division last night. I do not find them this morning. They said Mahone's division, with the exception of one brigade, was there.
