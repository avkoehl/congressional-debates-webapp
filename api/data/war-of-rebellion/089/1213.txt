COLONEL: By direction of Lieutenant-General Longstreet I have the honor to state to you for the attention of the commanding general that Major-General Pickett reports about 100 men from his command in the guard-house charged with the crime of desertion. He accounts for this state of things by the fact that every man sentenced to be shot for desertion for the past two months has been reprieved.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

OSMAN LATROBE,
