Colonel CHILDS:

(Care of Colonel Jackson, Wilmington.)

General Bragg desires you to return to Fayetteville with all your operatives. It was designed you should send only the guard, which you will now leave at Wilmington.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 17, 1865 - 8.30 a. m.

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston:

The enemy have taken Fort Fisher and cut off our resources from the lower forts. Can you send me with dispatch two heavy guns to defend the river? Should MR. Kenner, of Louisiana, visit Charleston expedite him. His mission is from the government.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
HEADQUARTERS YORK'S COMMAND,Salisbury, N. C., January 17, 1865.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: We have now in our camp between 600 and 700 recruits. The great obstacle has been the difficulty of procuring clothing and supplies from the quartermaster's department. We have also been interfered with by the recruiting officers of Lieutenant-Colonel Tuckner. If we could have the exclusive privilege of recruiting in all the prisons for a few weeks we have no doubt but that we could shortly muster a brigade, composed of such material as would reflect no discredit on our noble army. We hope that you will be so kind as to foster this enterprise, and to see that the necessary clothing, &amp;c., be furnished by the quartermaster's department, as we can do nothing without the uniforms.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. YORK,

Brigadier-General.
