HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA, Hart's Mill, Tex., September 11, 1863.

Mr. REUBEN W. CREEL,Chihuahua:

DEAR SIR: This section of country has always been prolific of rumors. Now we hare one that a band of guerrillas under Baylor will pay us a visit ere long. With you, I doubt any organized movement will be made assistant us in force, but the desperate state of affairs in Texas may prompt such a party as is now rumored to try a stealing raid out of sheer necessity for existence. It will be well for you to be on the alert in the direction of San Antonio. I send you the only late news-paper I could lay me hands on. The fall of Charleston at an early day is confidently looked for. Our relations with France appear critical.

I am, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
