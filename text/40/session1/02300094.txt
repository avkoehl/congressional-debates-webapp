THE CONGRESSIONAL. GLOBE;
March 14,
years to run; and a greater period than thirty
days should be allowed for competition. I
therefore suggest that it be enlarged to sixty
days.
Sir. WILLIAMS. I have no objection to
that.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the
Senator so modify his resolution?
Mr. "WILLIAMS. Yes, sir. -
The joint resolution was reported to the Sen-
ate, ordered to be engrossed for a third read-
ing, read the third time, and passed.
PENSION LAWS.
Mr. VAN WINKLE submitted the follow-
ing resolution ; which was considered by unan-
imous consent, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Committee on Pensions inquire
as to the propriety of providing by law that pensions
granted by special act of Congress shall be placed on
the same footing as to the amount to be paid as pen-
sions gfftuted under general laws.
BANKRUPT LAW.
Mr. MORTON. I offer the following reso-
lution, to be referred to the Committee on
Printing:
Resolved, That three thousand additional copies
of the bankrupt law be ordered to be printed for the
use of the Senate.
Mr. PATTERSON, of Tennessee. I move
to amend the resolution by inserting ''five
thousand" instead of "three thousand."
Mr. MORTON. I accept the modification.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The res-
olution will be so modified.
Mr. ANTHONY. Is the Senator aware that
some extra copies have already been ordered
and these will be in addition. Three thousand
have been already ordered to be printed.
Mr. PATTERSON, of Tennessee. I want
the number to be five thousand instead of three
thousand.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The res-
olution will be referred to the Committee on
Printing under the rules.
MESSAGE I"ROM THE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representa-
tives, by Mr. McPiiersox, its Clerk, announced
that the House of Representatives had passed
the joint resolution (S. R. No. 1) presenting
the thanks of Congress to George Peabody.
The message also announced that the House
had passed a joint resolution (H. R. No. 6)
placing certain troops of Missouri on an equal
footing with others as to bounty, in which the
concurrence of the Senate was requested.
ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED.
The message also announced that the Speaker

olution (S. R. No. 15) for the relief of freed-
meu or destitute colored people in the District
of Columbia ; and it was signed by the Presi-
dent pro tempore.
SUPPLEMENTARY RECONSTRUCTION BILL.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of House bill
No. 33.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 33) supplementary
to an act entitled "An act to provide for the
more efficient government of the rebel States,"
jjassed March 2, 1867, and to facilitate resto-
ration.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Committee on the
.Judiciary have reported an amendment in the
form of a substitute for the bill. The substi-
tute is the House bill very nearly, with a num-
ber of unimportant alterations and some that
are perhaps somewhat important. We thought
the proposition of the committee would be
better understood by submitting as one amend-
ment, and have therefore offered it in the form
of a substitute so as to prevent confusion. I
suggest that, unless some Senator desires to
hear the original bill read, the substitute only
need be read.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The sub-
stitute alone will be read unless some Senator
calls for the reading of the original bill.
Mr. HOWARD. I think the bill itself had
better be read before the substitute is read.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill
will be read.
The Secretary read the.bill as passed by the
House of Representatives, and next the amend-
ment reported by the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, which was to strike out all of the bill
after the enacting clause and to insert:
That before the 1st day of September, 1867, the com-
manding general in each district defined by an act
entitled "An atf to provide for the more efficient
government of the rebel States," passed March 2,
1867, shall cause aregistration to be madeof themale

and upward, resident in each county or parish in the

tration shall include only those persons who are
qualified to vote for delegates by the act aforesaid,
and who shallhave taken and subscribed the follow-
ing oath or afiimatioii: "I, , of , in the

place to be mentioned in the notification, and said

a vote whether it is the wish of the people of such
State to frame a constitution and civil government
according to the provisions of this act and the act to
which it is supplementary, and if so, shall proceedto

erty in such State as may be necessary to pay the
same.
Sec. 8. And be it further enacted, That the word
article, in the sixth section of the act to which this
is supplementary, shall bo construed to mean section.
Mr. DRAKE. I suppose, Mr. President,
that the matter which is subject to amendment
at this time is the proposed substitute reported
by the Judiciary Committee. Am I right iu
that supposition?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, sir.
Mr. DRAKE. I have several amendments
which I wish to offer to that substitute. The
first one I will present now. It is to insert
after the second section of the substitute the
following section:
And be it further enacted. That at said election the
registered voters of each State shall vote for or
against a convention to form a constitution there-
for under this act. Those voting in favor of such a
convention shall have written or printed on tho bal-
lots by which they vote for delegates as aforesaid the
words "for a convention," and those voting against
such a convention shall have written or printed on
such ballots the words '' against a convention." The
persons appointed to superintend said election, and
make return of the votes given thereat, as herein-
after provided, shall count and make return of the
votes given for and against a convention ; and the
commanding general, to whom the samo shall have
been returned, shall ascertain and declare the total
vote in each State for and against a convention. If
a majority of the whole number of voters registered
in any State as aforesaid shall have voted for a con-
vention, then such a convention shall be held ashere-
inafter provided; and if a majority of such wholo
number of voters shall have voted against a conven-
tion, then no such convention shall be held under
this act.
It will be seen, Mr. President, by reference
to the third section of the substitute presented
by the Judiciary Committee, in lines fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen, that it is pro-
vided that the convention-â
When organized shall first determine by a voto
whether it is the wish of the people of such State to
frame a constitution and civil government according
to tho provisions of this act and the act to which it
is supplementary, and if so, they are to proceed to
frame such constitution.
I think that is an unwise provision in this act.
I do not think that the individuals elected as
members of the convention should have it in
their power to make an official expression of
what they choose to consider or declare to be
the wish of the people; but that the people
themselves should by their votes declare their
wishes on that subject. If there is any State
there that does not wish to form a State govern-
ment under this act, let the people of that State
so declare by their own votes, and not by the
voice of the delegates that they elect to a con-
vention. If there is any State which does desire
to form a State government under this act, let its
people express their wish upon that subject by
their own votes, and not by the voice of their
delegates elected to the convention. In other
words, Mr. President, I do not propose that
this act or any other act of the Congress of the
United States should put it in the power of
any set of men to thwart or defeat the will of
the people of any one of these States. I wish
that the people of eaoh State should have full
freedom to do or not to do under this act.
Therefore it is that if the expression of the
wish of the people is to be had in reference to
this matter, I desire it to be directly by the
people, and not by the delegates elected in con-
vention.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The amendment sug-
gested by the Senator from Missouri was con-
sidered in committee, not in the precise form
in which he has presented it to the Senate, but
the propriety of such a provision was con-
sidered by the committee, and for two reasons
it was thought more advisable to adopt the
mode provided by the committee to ascertain
the wishes of the people.
The Senator from Missouri "will remembei
that our Government is carried on by repre-
sentatives. The people themselves govern
through representatives in this country; and
it is proposed that the delegates, who are elec-
ted by the people, shall determine whether it
is the desire of the people to frame a consti-
tution under this bill. The question will enter
into the flection of delegates, if there be a
