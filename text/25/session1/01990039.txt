APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cos.G....lst Sess.
Postponement of fottith instalment—Mr. Jones.
H. of Reps
Bui it is contended by others, that as the law
provided that all the money which should be in the
Treasury on the 1st day of January, 1837, reserv-
ing the sum of five millions of dollars, should be
deposited with the States, that the faith ot the Go-
vernment was thereby pledged to execute the de-
posite act to the letter, and that, whatever may be
the necessities of the Government, it can exercise
no control whatever ovei the subject, until the de-
posite shall have been actually made with the
States
I, Mr Chairman, would be one of the last, I
could hope, sir, the v ery last, who would be wil-
ling to do any act, the tendency of which was, to
violate the pledged faith of this Government if all
besides shall be lost, let us maintain untarnished
out honor. And if gentleman can satisfy me, that
there is any thing in the act of June, 1836, which
imposes an obligation, either legal or moral, to
make the deposite of the fourth instalment with the
States, I will wilhngly abandon all the opinions I
now entertain upon the subject, and m good faith
execute every provision of that law to the letter,
but if this can not be shown, as I think it can not,
what good and sufficient reason can ba assigned
for incurring a debt, which must be paid by taxa-
tion on the people, undei a sy stem which is une-
qual m its opeiation, unjust m its principles, and
absolutely ruinous to the great agricultural inte-
rests of the country
A more rigid rule of interpretation thin that
contended for, could not be applied to the most
highly penal statute, an interpretation which would
defeat entirely the plain and obvious spirit and
intent of the law, it it did not lead to a violation of
the Constitution, and I call upon gentlemen t >
show what con tititional authority Congress has
to pass a law to raise money, not m execution of
any of its conceded povveis, but foi the avowsd
purpose of making a deposite with the States
I do not desire to be understood as maintaining
that an inconvenience merely, attending any given
construction of a law, is sufficient to show such
construction to be fa'se, or that to be the true
construction which would avoid inconvenience
Where the language of a law is explicit, and the in-
tention evident, whatever may be the inconvenience,
such inconvenience must be boine But in the
interpretation of a statute not penal in its charac-
ter, the plain object of its framers should never be
lost sight of, and in oidei to asccitain '«hat was
really intended bv those w ho framed the deposite
act, I know of no safir baide than to refer to co-
temporaneous expositions of it, given at the *ime
of its passage and I asr, sir, if ileie was oa"
man at that tune who ad . orated it upon the ground
that it was a distr b ition act? Not one Does any
one now deny thaf tne surplus is the money of this
Government? or did it ever enter into the mind of
any man that it was to be placed where the Go-
vernment could not control if—that it w it, to be
paid over to the States at every hazard, ree ldless
of what might be the wants of the General Govern-
ment'' Such a  opmun could not hive been seri-
ously entertained by an one and Oongipss, w th
a view to make the operation as easv a one as pos-
sible with the dppjsite banks, ptovided foi its
transfer, by instalments, on tle firs of January,
the first of April, the first of Julv, and the first of
Octobei, upon the sappositioa that at these several
periods there would be in tne Treasuiy the íespec-
tive sums proposed to be tiansierred \nd must
not that have been the expectation of the States?
In othei words, did the General Government in-
tend to do more than merely to trar-sfer the surplus
revenue1 and coald tl e States hav e expected more?
To suppose that more than this isas designed,
would be to suppose that Congiess intended to
incur a deot, for no other purpose undei heaven
except to deposite it with the Siates for safe Keep-
ing alone
If, then, Mi Chanman, I am right in the inter-
pretation which I have pi iced upon the deposite
law, that law has nn fully answered us em', it
has rid us of the surplus, and ihfe no longer exis s
an obligation upon the Government, eithei legal or
moral, to transfer th fourth mstalmuit to the
States But again suppos- the transiei shall now
be made, would not the Secretar} of the Treasury
have the right immediately to require < f the States
to pay it bark? This, I presume, will be admitted
by all, and if the power exists to call it back, what
good and sufficient reason can be aligned against
withholding if
It has been contended, however, that an expecta-
tion has been raised on the pait of the States, that
the transfer v. ould be made, that upon the faith of
that expectation, the States had actually gone on
to appropriate the amount, and that such expecta-
tion should not now be disappointed This, sir,
may be true, and I doubt not is true, as to many of
the State  It may be that the course of legisla-
tion on the part of the States may subject them to
very serious inconvenience, and possibly to los ,
but the inquiry immediately recurs, whose act was
it that produced the difficulties with the States' It
was the action of the States themselves, through
their legislatures, action, too, taken bv them, with
full knowledge that ihe money so applied «as nei-
ther given or loaned, but meielv deposited, liable
to be called for at any moment, when the wants of
the Go\ ernmenl should render necessary itsie-
furn And the aigument from inconvenience, if it
be woith any thing, is just as conclusive to p^ove
that the amount, when deposited, could ?t no future
day be called for, for I presn mp it will never be
entirely convenient to pay back the amount It
proves that what was intended, and declared to be,
a mere deposite for safe keeping, was in truth and
in fact a gift, absolute and unconditional That
such was never the intention of Congress, is tende-
red too plain by the terms of th  law itself, to ad-
mit even of doubt
But suppose it halt now be determined to pay
oi er the fourth mst ilment to the States how is the
imount to be raised' It is not in the Treasury,
for, to all practical purposes, we have very nearly
an empty Treasury by th s I mean that the avail-
able means at the disposal of the Secretary, are not
sufficient to meet the demands upon it How then
is the money to be raised1* I presums by a loan
of some kind, with the faith of the Government
pledged for its redemption, but ultimately to be dis-
charged and paid off through the ordinary channels
of taxation upon the people It follows, then, that
the people are to be taxed to r use money to distri-
bute among the people You most graciously giv e
them witn one hand, an! take back with the other,
a like imount, increased howevei, b> the costs ind
charges of collection, and also bv the amount of
interest that may have accrued on the loan The
conclusion seems to meinevitable, that the passage
of the bill now undei consideration will give to tl e
fourth instalment its proper duecuon, by placing it
in a condition to be applied to the legitimate pur
poses of the Government fc wmch it was original-
ly intended
Su, I have never belonged to that old school of
politician (the federalists) who believe 1 that a na-
tional debt was a national blessing I consul r a
national debt a national Cjrse never to be saldtpd
upon my country except under c cumstan"es of
t'ie most ov en ilmg n«cessitv
Mr Chanm in, Í have heard from eveiy lank of
tneopaosition, the most unqualifiedcondemnai ons
of all the measures pioposed by tne administration
foi the lei ef of Deople , their condemnations have
been poured out m onp unbroken torrent upon
them, from evciy quarter we have heard the
charge, «rung upon every kev, tnat the measures
proposed would afford no relief I, sn am rot one
of those who believe that the halls of legislation
are the places to repau the ruiner1 fortunes of men,
I hold the doctrine taught by those who are the
most reveled on the list of our statesmen, that
Government shall extend its powers no further than
may tie necessaiy to protect mdiv iduals m the en-
joyment of their constitutional lights and privi-
leges, alwajs guarding them against fiaud and
violence, but leavin^, each and eveij one to the
enjev ment of his ovs n mdustij, and to pursue his
own happiness in his own way Such a Gov em-
inent is not only free, bm ihe most, precious ot hu-
man b'essmgs , to leave man 'o leap, under its be-
nign piotection, the rewaids ot virtue, mdus ry,and
pmdence, is the precious inhentance of the free-
men of this land, purchased at the price of treasure
and of blood.
I, sir, admit that it is the duty of (he administra-
tion to propose measures of relief Those mea-
sures have been offeipd, and ar  nov before the
country, and will be passed upon by the people
But, sir, is it true that they propose no relief?
What is the object of the bill now before you, but
to apply the money which tae people have already
paid to the legitimate puiptses for wh-ch it had
been raised, and thus to relieve the country from a
national debt, which must, at some future time, be
paid through the ordinary channels of taxation ?
What is the bill by vv hich it is proposed to issue
twelve millions of Treasury nous, but a'lditioia.l
relief to that large and respectable class ot om c<t.~
zens, the merchants, up m whom has fallen so hea-
vily the present wide-spread and calamitous em-
banassments, supplying a substituí for gold and
silver with which to meet their engagements with
the Government, to aid them in the payment of
their foreign debt—w hile it holds out to all classes
important advantages? What is the bill upon your
table, which proposed to extend the time of pay-
ment on duty bonds—postponing beyond the year
the payment of nilhons of dollar —but relief, sub-
stantial ieiief, to the merchants, relief which
places it m their powei to extend like relief to their
debtors') What is the bill for adjusting the remain-
ing claims on the late deposite banks, but a mea-
sure affording similar relief to those banks, and
thus putting it in their power still further to ac-
commodate their dealers? Yes, sir, relief to those
very banks selected as the depositories oí the public
money, which, in a time of piofound peace, with
eighty millions of dollars of specie in the country,
had closed then doors against the Government and
against the people In short, sir, what debtor of
the Government is it whose case has been legarded
wih indifference, or to whose petition a deaf ear
has been turned? And yet gen tienen c n discovei
no relief in all this
We know that, in times of sudden embarrass-
ment and distress, all communities are but too apt
to look to the Government for too much, and
whenever the Government undertakes to interfere
m the private pursuits of men, t must, of necessity,
in endeavoring to rel eve one class, violate the
lights of another, holding equal claims upon it
This, «ir, has been ftlt in all its overwhelmmg
forci, under your system rf tariff laws, which,
"or \ears p- ha" bori e down, and oppressed, the
, ople ot th" aouth, drawing fi mi their p< ckets-
th<= hai I earmns  of 'heir hones' mdjstry to sus-
tain (without anv adequate return1! in another
quarter of the Union, the great manufacturing in-
teresis which have grown up under it It has
been felt, too, in the exclusive privileges conferred
upon the Bank of the United States, now again
struggling for existence, and openly advocated
heie upon the ground that it is a panacea for
everv political disaster, and for every national
calamity, but I forbear to go into these topics.
l_,pt us /'opt tne measures which hav e been pro-
posed an 1 rely, for further relief, upon tne enter-
pris íicMisij and irugahly of the people Sir,
it is not so much to legislation, as to the growing
cropofcotion t( aceo v heat, and rice that I look
foi substantial iti ef It is the prodactive labor of
the countrv hat i to dispel the gloom that hangs
over it, and le ltve the embari assments which
piess ~o Veavily upon us
But still, vay gentlemen, there is no relief pro-
posed It is an easy task to find fault with every
thing that is ibc woik ot man, but somewhat more
difficult to Kin-ill the defects complained of Let
those who m ik- the chaige devise a better scheme,
let them piesent it, compare it with the one which
has been offered, and, if it shall afford more solid
ind substantial adv antages come from what quar-
tet it may, I, fot one, will give to it my humble
suppc rt
An honoiable mombei from Pennsylvania (Mr,
Bidd'e) h is characterised this bill as another expe-
tirnent raf jrming us at the samp time that he was
heartiü sick of experiments What, I would ask
ot th-u gentleman, is the bill under which he now
clams for his State one million of dollars, but one
ot 'hese much abus d and unttied experiments? an

captivating and dazzling medium oí a million, ts
