COLONEL: Nothing has occurred along my front worthy of reporting during the past twenty-four hours. The Second Corps U. S. Army is still in my front. A deserter from the Sixty-first New York Regiment came over this morning. He reports that Grant is receiving a good many recruits, but that they are very raw and would not do much service in battle. General Hoke is relieving my command.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Gracie's brigade, killed, 1; Ransom's brigade, killed, 1; Elliott's brigade, wounded, 1; total, 2 killed, 1 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,,

COLONEL: The enemy opened musketry volleys twice upon the lines of Wise's and Ransom's brigades (the left of my command) last night at 10 and 11 o'clock, respectively. They, at the same time, threw up signals. It is supposed that the volleys were fired in order to call forth a response and find out the strength of our line. Colonel Goode, com-
