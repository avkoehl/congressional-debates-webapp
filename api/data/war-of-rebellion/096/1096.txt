SUGAR LOAF, January 18, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I am sorry General Bragg allowed himself to be at all disturbed about the article you refer to. My views about the matter are not charged, and I care nothing for what is said in a newspaper. My only desire is to have my superior officer satisfied.

Very respectfully, yours,

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 18, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: All has been quiet until this afternoon about 4 o'clock, when the enemy advanced a strong skirmish-line to feel my strength, but very soon retired. We will be very vigilant and use every effort to meet them should they advance.

Respectfully, yours,

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

FORT ANDERONS, January 18, 1865.

Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Wilmington:

No change since yesterday. Up to about midnight the enemy had not entered Smithville. I would respectfully ask for some cavalry to be used below this point as scouts and pickets; also for the purpose of establishing a line of couriers between here and Wilmington. I would ask for a small boat from Wilmington, so as to have easy communication with Major-General Hoke.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Major-General.

FORT ANDERSON, January 18, 1865.

Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON:

I have here some sick men who will not be fit for duty for a long while. I wish to remove them to Wilmington, or any other point you may direct; but I have no ambulances or wagons to do so, and respectfully ask,that ambulances be sent me.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

Two companies of cavalry are ordered to you from Masonsborough. Your sick can be brought up by steamer going down to-day. Small boat will be sent you and General Hoke. Has Colonel Simonton started up? If not, send him immediately.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
