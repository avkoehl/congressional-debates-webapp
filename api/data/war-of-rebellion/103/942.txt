SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

Brigadier General H. B. Lyon is now here, having succeeded in getting out with a portion of his command. I respectfully request that he be ordered to report to me. Present condition of affairs prevents his accomplishing anything now in the department to which he was ordered by the War Department. Also respectfully request an answer to my telegram asking that General Roddey's orders be so changed as to allow me to remove him from North Alabama, and place troops there who have no local interest in that region.

Respectfully,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General Maury telegraphs from Mobile to-day as follows, viz:

News from New Orleans to Friday evening: Large force assembled there; they say their destination Mobile. No collection of transports on lake nor heavy guns.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.
