SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Numbers 150. June 2, 1864.

1. The wounded now with this army, and such severe cases of sickness as the corps medical directors may indicate, will be sent to the White House under the general direction of the chief quartermaster and medical director of the army.

As far as practicable, empty wagons will be used for this purpose and the trains from the several corps will rendezvous at Anderson's on the road from the supply trains to the White House.

The wounded will be supplied by their corps commanders with the necessary medical attendants, medical supplies, and one day's rations.

All empty wagons not required for the conveyance of the wounded will be sent at the same time to the White House for supplies, accompanied by such officers as may be necessary to draw supplies required for this army.

The commander of the Second Corps will furnish a small escort for the trains, and the commander of the escort will report early to-morrow to the chief officer of the quartermaster's department at the general supply train at Anderson's.
