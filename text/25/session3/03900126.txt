alliance and then  seciet ballot, and what have
they done'   Their first act, too, mark that
They have not only selected a majority of the
committee fiom a minoiity of the House, and
who represent a minonty of the freemen of the
country, but, contrary to every principle of lib-
erality heretofoie piacticed by the Speaker, of
placing on the committees such as the minority
party might desne, they have denied, and persist
m refusing to give to the majority, even of the
House, and the majority of the country, one single
man that they desire to be placed on that com-
mittee to represent the majority of both the House
and the country A step taken, sir, tlittle beyond
anything heretofore known in this Government
of freemen, since the foundation of our flee Re-
public Yes, sn , they are now endcavonng to
force on the committee a small minority of mem-
bers to represent the majority, who do not wish
to act themselves, and who are not the choice of
the- majority whom they are to repiesent as a
party They have refused, as a party, to vote
to place a single man on the committee that has
been selected to be placed on it by the Republican
party, whom they are to represent, and are now
determined, aftir having elected a majority of the
committee fiom theirown minority of theHouse
and the country, imbued with all then prccom
initials and piejudgments, as openly pronounced
on this floor, to select such of the remanidor of
the committee as they may think disim lined, ami
too inefficient to do justice to the jiaities con-
cerned—the Republican party, or the count!y at
large—displaying a species of pertinacity and
albttiary rule, heietofoie unknown to the better
days of this Republic Evincing a deposition
for, and a determination in the exercise of, aibi-
trary powei that is without a parallel m the annals
of free republican Govtrnmeuts They have not
been contented m getting and selecting their own
•nen, and a majority too, though themselves in a
■minority, but are determined to select Í01 us oars,
n 'the veiy face of our remonstrances against the
justice of such a selection, and attempt to force
men upon the committee to represent us, against
3ur will or wishes, and all this done, too, Mr, by
4 party heretofore clamoious against you, and the
majority ot this House, for the usi of aibitiaiy
power. Meruful God1 What a lesson on the
oeauties of hypocusy and consistency here, aie
we taught'
Look, t,ir, at the composition of the committee
asalicidy foimed—siv out of nine deadly hos-
tile to eveiy punciple, opinion, fieling, and Hi-
ten st of the Republican pai tj, though some may
profess a little fiiendship foi it, (pnhaps to make
things eairjal home,) and the remaining three, it is
obstinately oppo^ed to be given to the majority,
to be composed of such men as in whose abilities
and political integrity they tnteitatn the highest
regard, and would choost to trust on Mich an oc-
casion Here, sn, is a bright specimen of the
fairness, purity, impartiality, and disinteiested
ness of this immaculate party, who were wont to
sicken with disgust and nauseate at the veiy name
of coiruption and foul [ilay in politics Histoiy
will do them justice for then purity and the hon
esty of their piofessions, and prosperity should
not fail to award them a crown, more durable
than brass, for so eagerly embiaeing that par-
tiality and corruption which theyhave so bitterly
denounced, when charged to be practiced in the
worst degree by others Let not those gentle
men deceive themselves, in the powers of their
splendid talents, in making all to gli&ten that does
not shine Letthem not presume too much upon
their power of pome-making, and to alarm the
weak and ignorant against their Government, be-
cause they themselves cannot rule it, nor then
powers of eloquence and declamation to bewilder
and stultify the popular sense and moral feelings
of the hardy yeomanry and people of this coun-
try The Republican party have only asked to
place on this committee such men as they can
rely on, if but two or three, with such talents and
qualifications as wilt enable them to do justice to
the majority of this House, to the Administra-
tion, and to amajonty of the people of this coun-
try, and, sir, this they are denied
The Whig party aie determined, then, to have
the entire control of this whole investigation, the
entire game in their own hands, to be conducted
in their own way, with the Conservatives to pro-
tect their friend Swartwout, and to throw, no
doubt, if possible, the entire blame on the Gen-
eial Government From every indication yet
elicited, little, in my judgment, is to be expected
from that committee, but a most paitisan investi-
gation and criminating repoit It would be d's-
creditable to the declaration of individuals, as
already expressed on this floor, to believe the
contrary, yet these have been the very first indi
viduals to be placed on the committee by their
■party, with what degiee of fairness and impar-
tiality the intelligent freemen of this country will
decíate
Sir, I have heard much of the celebrated inves-
tigation of the United States Bank, and the far-
famed committeeumversally known as the "white-
wash committee," but if this does not tuin out to
be a blackivash committee, then am I no prophet,
nor the son of a piophet
Mr WISE rose, and was understood to say
he demanded an explanation He wished to
i know whether the gentleman meant to say the
I committee would intentionally misif present what
was tiue, or say what was not tiue' and whether
| Mi W , as one of the members, had ever done,
, 01 would <lo so '
Mi BYNllVT stid, were he not disposed of
' his own aeeoid to do all that was fair on the occa-
sion, he should disdain to an->wci anymquuy,
but he was deteimined to look to the condition of
the countiy, and the situation of the paity with
which he had the honoi to act He h id nothing
to do with the gentleman fiom Vnginia as an in-
dividual theie He should scorn to answer any
question which required him to select that gentle-
man, or any othei, fiom the rest of the commit-
tee He confessed that there were some gentle-
men on the committee for whom ho had the
highest lespect and peisonal legard, but was free
to confess that then were otheis for whom he
had little01 none Thedemand ofthekind whieh
had been made, however, would, of itself, pie-
vent his expressing any opinions of individuals
Mr WlisL still insistí d The gentleman had
made some exceptions Did he mean to desig-
nate him '
Mr liYNUM said, if the gentleman wished to
put questions to him, he had bettei wait until he
had concluded lit could assme the gentleman
that the icol pion tod he had so fiequently attemjited
to wuld ovei that House had no terms foi him,
nor would it have, were he a thousand times
moie ternficthan he would have the world believe
him to be Would he now attempt to force gen-
tlemen to say that they did not believe his former
declarations, as made on that floor, as to the guilt
or innocence of cei tain individuals ' The gentle-
man himself might have believed them—might
have made them in good faith at the time He
should not undertake to decide upon his motives
orsincenty He had no explanations to make
to that gentleman
Mi B thought he had now shown most clearly
the extraoidmarydilemma and awkward predic-
ament in which this purity party had fallen, by
the singular course they had taken on the present
occasion He thought he had shown most con-
clusively, and placed far beyond all future cavil
forever hereaftei, the hollow pretenses of that
party to fairness, liberality, and impartiality It
was impossible, it appeared to him, that they
could ever hear again these sacred words men-
tioned , without a crimson blush of shame arising
on then cheek
With these general remarks, (said he,) I will
now proceed to notice what has fallen fiom sev-
eial gentlemen in relation to this subject, as de-
claied on the floor of Congress, and which I
confess 1 heaid with no little astonishment, as-
tonished, sir, because I heaid it declared on the
floor of this House, by a Representative in Con-
gress who, it should be presumed, would declare
nothing heie that he was not prepaied with the
proof to substantiate To become the common
reviier and calumniator of those whose virtues
and long-tried set vices have recommended them
to higher places than our own, has become a
piaetice, sir, of this House, little less deiogatoiy
to the standing of a member of Congress than it
is disreputable to the councils of a great nation
of freemen, of which it has heretofore been our
pride and ourpleasure to boast Nor would I be
considered amongst those who would throw the
least obstacle in the way of the strictest sciutmy
into the conduct of public officers occupying high
places I consider them amenable to the Repre-
sentatives and to the people for the faithful dis
charge of the high tiust that has been confided to
them, and shall ever be for holding them to the
strictest accountability But, sn ,  nih I would
do that, though not a member of ihe " decency
party," I hope I shall never, on this floor, lose a
proper íespect for the offices of my Government,
if I should retain none for the occupant A be-
coming respect, sir, for the Government of my
nation, and a respect due to our beloved country,
should forbid it Continue your abuse and cal-
umny and detraction of all in the higher offices
of your Government, and you level to the veiy
earth the most exalted stations, to which it
should be the pride and laudable ambition of
e^eryfieeman to aspire, as the meed of meat
and the greatest íeward of the most illustrious
deeds that fieemen can confer Sir, continue to
degrade and disgrace every officer in your Gov-
ernment, and what sagacious statesman is there
amongst us that cannot easily foresee the disas-
tious íesultsand downward tendency into which
our whole political fabnc must soon tumble'
All fiee Governments are based alone upon
opinion, and whin, fiom constant abuse and de-
gradation of the offices and officers of a Govern-
ment, public opinion becomes infected and loses
a pioper respect for the Government itself, what
must naturally follow but a change of the whole
system, and a speedy resort to some other foi
which they may have a greater resjiect' And is
this the tiue object of your mdiseummate abuse
of all the officers of this fiee Government' I be-
lieve, in the sincerity of my heart, it is the true,
secret, and sole object of many But we are told
that these denunciations are not directed against
the offices, but against the officers who fill them.
Now, su, there is a certain principle in meta-
physics which has evir proven the nresistibihty
and influence of the power of association Keep
up your constant dcgiadation of youi officers oc-
cupying high places, and how long, from this
veiy powei of association, before you imbibe,
and induce otheis to do it, imperceptibly often,
the greatest contempt for tne offices themselves,
and which offices alone constitute the Govern-
ment itself' Who are so blind, then, as not to
see the deadly blow, in all this indiscriminate
calumny, abuse,and detraction,aimed at the very
stability and existence of the present system of
this, our free Republican Jbrm of Government'
Who is theie so blind as cannot see the danger
that such a course at once threatens to the dura-
bility and permanency of the present system of
our free, republican Government, and wilhwhat
pride such a course here must be hailed through-
out the world by the implacable enemies of all
free Governments' With what cheering hopes
it must inspire the great enemies of our freedom,
both at home and abroad' Sir, these are sub-
jects of the greatest moment and high considera-
tion to the philosophical statesman who reflects
upon the destiny of empires and the fate of re-
publics, and let no man blind himself to the les-
sons of experience, which the history of fallen
nations should teach us upon these absorbing
subjects Then how should any man who pro-
fesses a becoming regard foi his Government,
and the institutions under which he lives, justify
himself in rising heie from his seat and pro-
nouncing one of the first officers in the Govern-
ment "a corrupt pander of power, the paiticeps
cnminis of a hundred defalcations," without the
safety of the Republic demanded it, and he had
the proof at hand to establish so foul a charge
beyond the power of cavil or contradiction' Are
gentlemen prepared with their proofs to establish
these chaiges, or, if they fail, are they prepared
to meet their constituents and defend themselves
against the charge of uttering the foulest calum-
nies meiely for the gratification of the blackest
political spleen and party malice' What excuse
should the American people (those who are now
not prepaied for i evolution and plunder) leceive
as a justification of such a course J Aie gentle-
men awaie of the high and awful responsibility
that they assume in belching forth thisindiscrim-
