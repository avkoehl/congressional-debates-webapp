Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Hartsuff has captured a man from Mahone's division and has carefully observed his from. He says he is morally certain that Mahone's division has moved. I have directed him to open all his artillery on the enemy. If this develops anything to advance and feel the position. I wish I had a little brigade to send him. There is no change on my front.

The only information we have of the presence of Mahone's division south of the Appomattox is from prisoners who say they understand it is in reserve on this side. I do not think it has moved unless it was this p.m. Prisoners say they understand 12,000 men are coming from north side.
