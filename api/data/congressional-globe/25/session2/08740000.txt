splendid halls and lofty colonades, towering m all
the pride and glory of classic architecture, may
not be too high for the* grasp of the people's rage
Over deeper, w ider foundations, planted as they
may have been firmly m the affections and inte-
rests of the people, the ploughshare of rum has
been ruthlessly driven
Mr   Chairman, this method of embarrassing
the Government, by "stopping the supplies," is
not new even m the history of this country    It
was  tried  during the last war, and we alt know
the result.   The supplies were oppobed by a cer-
tain  party in this   country    within these walls,
and, out of this House,aft*r the supplies were voted,
the same party did all in their power to defeat the
Government m negotiating its loans to carry on
the war    I do not intend, sir, to indulge in mdis
enmate condemnation of the  motives, although
I do not approve of the conduct  of tms party
Many of them, I have no doubt, believe that their
course was justifiable, upon the highest principles
of poliGy    Their error was in acting upon the fear
of speculative evils, instead of doing their imme-
diate duty.   At that time England was battling,
not only for her own existence, but for the mde
pendence of all the nations of the earth    We had
undoubtedly, the best and highest causes for « ar—
but they might have supposed that succe <■ in such
a contest might have been our ruin, and that it En-
gland was overthrown, our liberties and indepen-
dence «ould pensh with her     But they opposed
their country in favor of a foreign enemy    Instead
of rallying to the support of the Government, at a
time of great danger and difficulty, they endea-
vored to paralize, embarrass, and overthrow it Sir,
what w as their fate1   The war rolled on—triumph-
antly rolled on—borne up  by the patriotism of the
people, responding to that lofty sentiment of him,
whose brow in life wore the laurel of the hero, and
whose memory should live forever embalmed in
the  ia)s of the  minstrel—"our country right or
wrong" Where are those who were for "stopping
the supplies" during the war?   Sunk forever into
privacy, suspicion, and contempt' Andso it will ever
be    The Government might be weak or wrong,
but the people will not stand passively by, and see
it beaten down by a foreign enemj, nor will they
now permit it to be appropriated and prostrated by
the banks and capitalists of the country    Why, if
we are to have masters, let them at least be those
whom we can restart 01 fear    Let theie be one
battle field at least, which can tell to aiter-times
that one brave and mighty effort was made for our
liberties   but to be overcome, not by the power of
tho sword, but by the influence of money—to give
up the Government and Constitution of the coun-
try by the base instrumentality of coloiedf votes,
or distress   wrung from the poor, or the tenors
of anarch}—Si1-, it «ill net be     The people—the
people will come to the rtscue     AlthouBh  sur-
rounded by rmsis and darkness, and drugged with
distress, they will eie long awake, and rising up in
the majesty of truth and justice, they will «nap
asunder the chains which ambition and avarice
have forged for their ruin    They will soon per-
ceive, from the principles and parties involved, that
the disgrace of the Government in this contest will
be their infamy—if? tall, their oveithrow  and that
noble patriotism whico, during the last war on land
and sea, rallied to us support, will once more come
forth in all its majestic power, and march on to vic-
tory    And in this mighty struggle where, sir, shall
each of us be found"!   My position, at least, shall
be in the van     If this Administration had conti-
nued ¡n its strength, approving as I do nearly all
of its measures, since I have been upon this floor,
I should have been content to stand aloof, as I have
heretofore done, and see it go on in us career of
constitutional usefulness and duty, bui the more it
has fallen,  the nearer I have found myself to its
destinies, and now, if it is to fall in maintenance
of the great financ al measures, upon which I be-
lieve it has staked its existence, I am willing, I am
ready, to go dow n with it Better to fall with those
who fall in defence of the Constitution and liber-
ties of the country, than triumph with those whose
victory, in, my opinion, will be their prostration
Mr  Chairman, our duty, on the present occa-
sion, appears to me to require us to pas  the bill
before the committee as soon as poastble The ne-
cessities of the Government cannot be postponed
Let those who agree m this opinion determine to
occasion as little delay as possible, by discussing
the measure, and be ever ready to vote upon it
It those who oppose the bill think proper to con-
sume time m diietusion, «nd thus postpone relief
to the Government, let them do it—on them be
the responsibility. If they think proper to defeat
the bill without any efficient substitute, let them do
it    On them be the" responsibility
NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY
REMARKS OF MR. FAIRFIELD,
Or Maine,
In the Howe of Representatives, May 29, 1838—
The question being on the motion of Mr Evans,
to refer the message of the President relating to
the Northeastern Boundary to the Committee on
Foreign Affairs
Mr FAIRFIELD said, that as he and his col-
league, who had just taken his seat, [Mi Evans,]
had the same object in view in regard to the set-
tlement ol the disputed boundary line, he was
happy to be able to say, that m the justness of
many of the remaiks of his colleague he entirely
concuired In regard, however, to the nature and
proper constt uciion of the proposition of this Go-
vernment to the British Government, as contained
in the letter of Mr Forsyth to Mr Fox, under date
of the 27th of April last, he felt constrained to
differ with him But whichever was right in this
respect, he agieed \uth his colleague in doubting
whtther any thing would come of it, even if ac-
cepted by the British Government It might, he
thought, reasonably be feared, that it would only
be productive of delay and vexation That, after
years had been frittered away in prosecuting the
object of the commission, we should find ourselves
where we were at the beginning, no nearer to a
determination of this long pending controversy,
and Gieat Britain, in the mean time, enjoying
most of the fruits ol ownership But the proposi-
tion—«hat is iti My colleague understands it as
expressing a willingness, on the part of this Go-
vernment, to authorize the exploration and survey,
«pon the, terms suggested by the British Govern-
ment, as their modifications of the original A.men-
can proposition He (Mi F ) could not so regard
it, but, on the contrary, simply as a proposition to
open a negotiation upon that bans The language
of Mr Forsyth is as follows " By the accom-
panying papers, received from the Executive of
Mime, Mr Fox will perceive that Mame declines
to give a consent to the negotiation for a conven-
tional boundary , is disinclined to the íeference of
the points in dispute to a new arbitration, but is
yet firmly persuaded that the line described in the
treaty of 1783 can be found and traced whenever
the Governments of the United States and Great
Britain shill proceed to make the requisite inves-
tigations, v. ith a predisposition to effect that very
deniable object Confidently re'ying, as the Pre-
sident does, upon the assurances frequently repeat-
ed by the British Government, of the earnest desire
to reach that result, if it is practicable, he has
instructed the undersigned to announce to Mr
Fox the willingness of this Government to enter
into an arrangement with Great Britain for the
establishment of a joint commission of survey and
exploration, upon the basis oí the original American
proposition, and the modifications offered by her
Majesty's Government " And he thereupon in-
vites Mr Fox to a conference upon the subject at
an early day
Now, though he (Mr F ) did not profess to be at
all familiar with the language and technicalities of
diplomacy, yet he could not think that any thing
more was intended by this than an offer to nego-
tiate an agreement in which the lerna of such agree-
ment were all open for discussion and determina-
tion The original Amtncan proposition and
the modifications thereof suggested by the Bri-
ltsh Government, were to form the basis of the
negotiation, and were not absolutely and uncondi-
tionally to be incorporated into the agreement itself.
One of the modifications of our original proposi-
tion was, that the commissioner should have the
right to diverge westerly from a due north line in
search of "highlands," and not easterly. Another
was, that they should run from the source of the
St. Croix to highlands that both parties would
agree were the highlands named in the treaty
Tin  would give to Great Britain much more than
she has now the hardihood to claim directly, for the
point of highlands which both would agree were
the highlands of the treaty would extend but a
short distance northerly of the head of Connecticut
river Neither of these can Mr Forsyth be consi-
dered as assenting to, indeed, the terms of his letter
would seem ilmost necessarily to exclude them,
for an agieement to the effect of either proposition
might, perhaps, be regarded as virtually assenting
to a conventional line, which the General Govern-
ment have again and again admitted they had no
light to do And Sir Charles R Vaughan, in his
letter to Mr. MtLane, February 10, 1834, takes
the sami" view of the nature of such an agreement,
and, then fore, insists that Mame should be a party
to it Mr Forsyth ttien, m a letter, in which he
was communicating the decision of the State of
Maine against investing the General Government
with power to agree to a conventional line, and
acknowledging her authority in that respect, could
not fairly be considered, in whatever language he
may have expressed himself, as mdirectiy agreeing
to any such line, or to an arrangement necessarily
involving it
Our original proposition was for the establish-
ment of a joint commission of survey, with poxver
to decide and settle the question conclusively The
proposition of the British Government was to have
such a commission of survey merely by way of
experiment, to ascertain facts, but without the
power of binding the parties These are the pro-
positions which are to constitute the elements of
the agreement now proposed
But to settle this question of construction con-
clusively, and not to leave it to the determination
of general reasoning, Mr F said he would ask
leave to read a letter from Mr Forsyth to one of
the Senators from Maine This Senator, under-
standing that different opinions were entertained
as to the extent and design of the proposition of
this Government to the British Government, ad-
dressed a letter to Mr Forsyth, asking /or an ex-
planation of it, in answer to which he received the
following
Dehartment op State,
May 26, 1838
Sir I have had the honor to receive your letter
of the 24th inst and to state in reply, that from the
negotiation to which the British Government has
been invited, the President anticipates the esta-
blishment of a joint commission with an umpire
whose power will be restricted to the purposes of
exploration and survey only, without authority
finally to decide upon the rights of the parties, as
contemplated in the original American proposition
The suggestions that have been made on either
side with respect to the mode of constituting that
commission, the principles upon which it is to act,
and the instructions to be given it, are all to be
discussed and decided upon as justice between the
parties and their respective rights shall be deemed
to require The object of the President in offering
to make such an arrangement, as you will see by
my note to Mr Fox of the 27th April last, is to
test the correctness of the opinion of the State of
Mamé", "that the line described in the treaty of
1783 can be found and traced whenever the Go-
vernments of the United States and Great Britain
shall proceed to make the requisite investigation,
with a predisposition to effect the desired object
I have the honor to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,
JOHN FORSYTH
To the Hon Reuel Wiixiams,
United Stales Senate.
This appeared to him (Mr F ) as conclusive up-
on the subject, and showed tnat his colleague had
misconceived the true meaning and import of the
proposition, at which, it is believed, he will be
much better pleased than he would have been to
have had his views upon the subject confirmed
