age of the first act in 1864, until they were
repealed in 1867 or 1868. Under authority of
these laws the collectors of the several dis-
tricts raised immense amounts of money on
cotton, and most if not all of it has passed
into the Treasury. The records in the inter-
nal revenue office show the amounts paid and
when paid, as will appear by comparative
statement now and here presented:

The people of the cotton States, upon whom
all the burden of this tax (amounting in the
aggregate to $68,072,388 99) fell, believing that
the tax was unconstitutional and knowing that
it was unusual and extraordinary, made a case
in one of the circuit • courts of the United
States, in which the question of the constitu-
tionality of the law was tried. This circuit
court decided the question against the cotton
tax-payers, when an appeal was entered in
the case, taking it to the Supreme Court of
the United States. After the question of the
constitutionality of these laws was elaborately
argued by some of the ablest lawyers of the
United States, this court, eight judges being
present, divided in opinion, four holding that
the laws were constitutional and the other
four holding the reverse, leaving the decision
of the court below affirmed in that particular
case.
The producers of the cotton, believing the
laws imposing the tax or excise on the cotton
to be unconstitutional, determined to appeal
to Congress, for a restitution of the money
raised by the tax, and have introduced bills
(four in number) into this House providing for
the refunding of the tax.
On these bills arise three very important
questions for the consideration of the House:
1. Whether the laws imposing the tax were
constitutional.
2. Whether these laws were just.
3. Whether under all the circumstances the
money raised under these laws should be re-
funded.
42d Cong. 3d Sess.—No. 4.
* This is probably an erroneous return.
Were these laws unconstitutional ? In this
connection, and just here, it is proper to say
that if the proposition is true that these laws
passed by Congress imposing a tax on raw
cotton were unconstitutional, the laws were
void and the taking the tax from the pro-
ducers and owners of the cotton was without
authority ; and if without authority, the taking
the money was the taking of private property,
and the transfer thereof to the Treasury of the
United States was an appropriation of it to
public use without making just compensation,
directly contravening the latter clause of the
fifth article of the amendments of the Consti-
tution, which says "nor shall private property
be taken for public use without just compen-
sation."
There are four clauses in the Constitution
of the United States, and only four, which
relate to the taxing powers of the Government.
I will present them. The first is to be found
in article one, section two :
" Representation and direct taxes shall be appor-
tioned among the several States which may be
included within this Union, according to their
respective numbers."
Second, article one, section eight:
" The Congress shall have power to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts, a,nd excises, to pay the debts
and provide for the common defense and general
welfare of the United States ; but all duties, imposts,
and excises shall be uniform throughout the United
States."
Third, article one, section nine:
" No capitation or other direct tax shall be laid
unless in proportion to the census or enumeration
hereinbefore directed to be taken."
Fourth:
" No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported
from any State."
Congress has no power under the Constitution
to lay any tax unless the power has been dele-
gated, and I find no power delegated except
the powers contained in these four provisions.
Now, is there anything in either of these four
provisions authorizing Congress to lay the tax
imposed on cotton by the acts passed in 1864,
1860, and 1867?
The Federal Government is a creation of
the States, made by the States or the people
thereof, by States after a recognition of their
independence and the establishment of State
governments by the people, respectively, of
the several States, and created under and
by the Constitution of the United States',
framed by the people of the States through
State representatives in convention assem-
bled and afterward ratified by the States.
The Constitution is the warrant for the
action of Congress, and Congress can act
only by and in the manner prescribed by
the Constitution. Therefore, if any condi-
tions are affixed to any power delegated to
Congress, Congress must comply with such
conditions ; if a particular mode is prescribed
for the exercise of a power, that mode must
be pursued.
Article one, section two, directs that direct
taxes shall be apportioned among the several
States in the same manner that representation
shall be apportioned.
Article one, section
directs that no
