SECOND Ohio, one from the Ninety-FIFTH Ohio, and one from the Ninety THIRD Indiana, in all, about 100 men. I attached hereto a very rough pencil sketch of so much of the grounds as was the theater of the principal operations, which many facilitate the understanding of this report, and aid in conveying distinct ideas of what I was ordered to do and was actually done. Just before night, I was ordered to do and session of the right hill, on the left of the road,, and advance the picket line to, or far enough beyond, the brick-pile and loose board shed to cover and protect the fatigue party that was to commence throwing up some works in the vicinity of the brick and boards about 10 or 11 o'clock at night.

From the base of the hill the road going toward the works of the enemy ascends rapidly to the turn to the left, from which point the ascent is more gradual to the level of the brick and boards. The gully on the right-hand side of the road at the turn to the left is quite deep. The distance from the crest of the hill, across to the road and toward the enemy, at the narrowest point near the brick and boards, does not exceed 3 or 4 roads. The face of the hill toward your brigade is abrupt and steep, and very difficult of ascent be men. From the highest points of the hill, beginning just beyond the large green tree and stretching off to our left, the ground descends gradually toward the road. There is growing corn on thee top pf the hill, in the bottom, and on the sides where it is possible to cultivate the soil. For several nights back our of the brick and boards, and to the right and left. There has also been a strong picket on the road at the turn to the left, with two or more single sentries farther in advance up the road. Until last nigh ne effort was made to prevent the posting of our pickets at these points.

I was ordered to post the pickets at an early hour, and as soon as it became dark enough to be safe, I moved the four companies by the flank to the foot of the hill on the left of their orad. I sent Captain General Thayer. The company of the Ninety-THIRD Indiana I formed in line between the road and old dead three, directing the captain to send 10 men, under charge of a lieutenant, to form a picket post at or near the turn in the road, advancing a sentry or two up the road, if practicable, the residue of the company to be held in reserve under charge of the captain. Captain Stansbury's company(Ninety-FIFTH Ohio) and Captain Snyder's company (Seventy-SECOND Ohio) I then moved by the left flank (Stansbury in advance) from the road to the left along the base of the hill, distributing the men in squads of 5 or 6 so as to be properly divided for picket posts when we reached the top of the hill. My left squad was advanced far enough to pass in, advancing near the right of General Lightburn's picket line when posted.

These dispositions being made simultaneously, Stansbury and Snyder and the Ninety-THIRD Indiana pickets commenced advancing, the two former directly up the steep hillside, the latter up the road. As few only of my men had gained the top, they discharged their pieces and then slid a short distance down the hill, the whole of two companies resting secure just under the brow of the hill, to which the enemy
