had a good deal of trouble from guerrillas. The request for arms and ammunition and clothing in Saint Louis have not been forwarded, and we have not power to do all we want. I have 1,000 men and I can't arm [them]. I shall start what forces I can raise after the rebels Saturday morning and run them as far as we can. Have written to Colonels Anderson and Forbes to co-operate. I am using all veteran officers I can. We are better off than a few days ago. Harris was captured last week, and the rebels hold high carnival in Monroe Country.
