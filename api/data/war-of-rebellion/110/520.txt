RICHMOND, VA., August 31, 1863.

Honorable A. H. STEPHENS,

Crawfordville, Ga.:

The enemy is reported in large force threatening our army in East Tennessee. That is the gate of Northern Georgia. We have sent all disposable re-enforcements, but require an addition to our army there. The militia and local defense men of Western Georgia and Northern Alabama could there render the most effective service for the defense of their own country. If you concur as to the propriety of sending them up to co-operate with Bragg or Buckner, you will oblige me by conferring with Governor Brown upon the subject.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., August 31, 1863.

Colonel JAMES CHESNUT,

Aide-de-Camp, Columbia, S. C.:

I wish you to visit Governors Brown, of Georgia, and Shorter, of Alabama, to confer with them as to the practicability of sending re-enforcements, local defense men or militia, to the aid of Generals Bragg and Buckner, against whom the enemy is moving in force. Northern Georgia and Alabama can be best defended by increasing the army in the east of Tennessee. Urge the advantages of this course and the necessity of prompt action.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
