wages, must depend on tne proportion which the whole capital
bears to the whole amount of the laboring population. If the
amount of capital is increased, without a corresponding increase
taking place in the population, a larger shaie of such capital
will lall to each individual, or the rate of wages will be mcreas
ed And if, on the other hand, population is increased faster
than capital, a lesa share will be appropriated to each indivi-
dual, or the rate of wages will be reduced "
"So long as capital and population continue to match abreast
or to increase or diminish m the same pioportion, so long will
the rate of wages, and consequently the condition of the labor-
ers, continue unaffected, and it is only when the proportion of
capital to population varies, when it s either mueusa 1 or o.

leratingthe increase of capital as compared with population,
or by retarding the increase of population as compaied with
capital, and every scheme of improving the condition of the
laborer, wmen. is not bottomed on this principle, or which has
not an increase of the ratio of capital to population for its
object, must be completely nugatorv and ineffectual "
Such are the views, not of a man who wishes to be returned
to Congiess upon some popular piejudice, w to aspires to a se
cretaryship, ora foreign mission, or to the Piesidency, b tt one
who writes for the benefit of mankind, and h willing to meet
his reward in the approbation of a benefited and grateful pos
tenty    If I may venture to illustiate his views, in thlscountty
we have now some eight on ten hundred millions of niculanng
medium, which is receiveJ, and gladly received, by all who
hav e debts to collect, as money    If you adopt the advice otler
ed, and destroy our banking i istitution*, you reduce the circu
iatmg medium to the amount of the specie in the nation, v  Inch
has been computedat eighty millions, uutl do not believe that
His much more than hail that amount    Then you will nave a
currency or circulating medium which, if you were to divide it
among the people, wauld give each individual some three oi
four dollars    The effects would be, that those who work for a
dollar a day now, would have their wages reduced to some ten
or twelve cents per day, lor, instead of incteasmg the capital
with the mercase of the population, you íejuce the capital to
about five per cent of what it is now, whilst the population of
the country increases iboutfivc per cent eveiy year    Or you
would have to raise the value of money moie than a thousand
percent and say that a dime shall in future pass for a dollar,
an eagle for a hundred dollars    I will read another extract
from his second chaptei, exhibits g tne ' Compaiativeinucise
of capital and population "   ' it is lot possible to ojtain," he
says,' any precisely accurate estimate of the absolute quantity
of capital ma country at different periods, but the capacity of
that capital to feed and employ laboréis, and the rate of its in
crease, may, notwithstanding, be learned with sufficient accu-
racy for our purpose, bj referring to the progress ot population
It is clear, from the s.atements already made, that the mhabi
tantsofa country, supposing them to have the same or about
the same, command of the necessaues and conveniences of life,
cannot increase without a corresponding increase oj capital
Whenevei, therefoie, we find the people 01 a country li creas
ing without any, or with but very little  vauation taking place
m their condition, we may conclude that the capital of he coun
tiy is increasing in. the •• ime or ve-v nea-the same piopoiuon
Now, it has been esta ilishelbeiOjrl tllque >nn ti a'thop-vu
lation of several <- rti e D'aie-< of Noi h Amenta lid , if   i ni Í

five years, and as the quant ty oí uecessaiies jnd conveniences
fahmg to the ebaie of ¿n inhabitant ot the Lmted ¡states has
not been materially increased or diminished during the last
century, this increase of population is a proof that the capital
of th - country has advanced m a coriespondmg ratio    But, la
all old settled counti íes, the increase of capital, and consequent-
ly, of population, is much lower    The population of Scotland,
for example, issupposed to have amounted to l,0o0 000 in 1/00,
and as it amounted to 2,135,000 m 1820, it would follow, on the
principle already stated, «hat the capital of the countrv had
requiredaboutonehundredandtwenty years  double    In like
manner, the population of England ami Wa'es amounted to
6 084 000 in, 1740, and to  13,25b,000 m 1821, showmg that die
population, and therefoie, tne capital of that countiy, appliia
ble to the support of man, or the supply ot <oo 1, Ciothes, and
other articles necessaiy for the supnert of human ¡i<t, had
doubled in about eighty years "
"The effects which the diffeient rates at Vvmch capital and
population ad vanee in diffeient countries hxvt on tl t, condition
of their inhabitants, may be exemplified in a very sinking
manner, by comparing the rate of increase and the actual
state of the people of Meat Britain, with the rate oi increase
and the actual state of the people of li eland It l  certainly
true there has been a considerable increase in the caoital of
Iieland during the last hundred years though no one m
the least acquainted with the progress of the different parts of
the empne, has ever supposed that this increase has home the
proportion either of a thud, or evenafouith, to the meiease
ofcapitalmEnuIand and Scotland during the same period
But the increase of population in Ireland, as compaied with its
increase m Britain, has been widely dufeteiu •'rom the increase
in the capital of the two countnes, or in their means oi employ
in«" oeople, supporting them mastate of comlort and respecta
bihty According to the table  given m the Parliam-ifuy re
pons, the population of Gieat Butam amounted in 1720, to
6955,000, and in 1S21 i> amounted to 14,301,000 having a little
more than doubled in the couise of the centurj whne fiom
the same reports, it appears thai the population of Iieland,
whose cap'tal had increaseam so inferior a proportion to that
ofBntam, amounted to very little more than two millions in
1731 and to very near seven millions in 1S21 having nearly
quadrupled in less time than the population of Biitim took to
double1"
He further says
"All the witnesses examined by the committee of the House
of Commons, on 'the employment of the pool of Iieland,' in
1823 concui in representing their numbeis as excessive, and
their condition as wretched in the extreme Their cabins,
which aie of the most miserable descuption, are utterly unpro
vided with any thing that can be called furniture   In many
families there are no sue h things as bed clothes The children,
m extensive districts of Munster, and the other provinces, have
not a single rag to cover their nakedness; and, whenever the
potato crop becomes even m a eheht degree deficient, the
scourge of famine and disease is felt in eveiy corner of the
country The Right Honorable Maurice Fitzgerald, M P
mentions that 'he had known the peasantry of Kerry quit then
houses in search of employment, offering to work for the mean
est subsistence that could be obtained, for two pence per day,
m short, for any thing that would purchase food enough to keep
them alive for the ensuing tweniy four hours ' "
I will read but one line more and then lay down this useful
volume He says, "that while the aveiage market puce of a
day's laboi m England may he taken at from 20ii to 2s it can
not be taken at more than 5d in Iieland "
Plies* undoubted historical facts are so conclusive to my mind,
that I will not attempt to enlarge upon whatscems so convuac
ing to the lefleumg understanding further than to say that
they first convince us that you are not to judge of the prosperity
oí a nation by its rapid meiease of population, but if capital
does not advance side by side with population, misery anci po
verty will be the inevitable consequence, and that the pooi will
be the first and most numerous sufferers, that capital advanced
in E igland with its population, and wealth and comfort followed
in its tram, population rapidly increased in Ireland, wluU-t capí
tal lagged behind, and misery and wretchedness now scourge
that people Thencairy out the Piesident's views, and those
of the Secielary after first destroying the United States Bank,
then destroying the State banks, by youi bankrupt scheme, de-
stroy capita1 destroy credit, which ihe Pi esidrnt eays has been
carried too far, and should be checked Do all this, and the
poor man see* his fate read in the histoiy of Ireland Their
distiesses are great beyond descuption, then means oi support
the most scanty, and the Insuman said tiuly,ashe said wittily,
that (he first mouthful of biead he ever ate was a potato, yes,
sir, Ihe potato is his meat arid his bread, and often he is without
it Carry out your system, and the cheapest lood, which is
the potato, will be that which the poor of this country will be
forced to live upon They will not be able to buy a barrel of
flour or abairel of pork
Bank credit, individual confidence, and the credit system,
have been the chief currency of our nation for fifty years. Ne-
ver has my nation prospered as this nation has in so short a pe-
uod But now the President tells us and the People that the
Government must cut loose fiom the communitv, that they
have tiaded on borrowed capital, and have cained the ciedit
system too far Such language would be ungenerous fiom that
«mice, if in all respects ti tie Who did most to adopt measure 
which brought about these íesults'í You destroyed the United
States Bank, and at least tacitly invited the Sutes to fill the
vacuum of that institution by making hanks of iheir own You
told these State banks to discount (¿berallv The People, be

demonstration, that the fiist cau<i of 0111 distresses was the war
fare upon the bank and the cmrencj by Geneial Jackson in
this country , and that so cleaily allied is the whole commercial
world with this nation that embarrassments in this country are

Hut I denv that any of the Ger name pro% mees have gaintu
the r wealth or their piotpenty by the simple gold money   y
tern, by ex< ludmg the whole foundations of the credit system
Vid, in support of this opinion I will lead one sentence from
Ihe fii«t volume of Lord Brougham's admirable work on the
Colonial Policy of European Nations   "Credit has contributed
to the astonishing increase of the Dutch settlements, so much
wanted in all other colonies '   To sustain this opimon I will
read an extract from Thornton, on Paper Creht, show 1115 ihi..
paper credit has been a great cau«e of th? pinspelity ol Ho
land    He says, "the extent of the cnfuHting medium of Hoi
land is deserving of nonce    B«sidis the gieal oiu.iil.moii ol
bank notes  ami receipts   tovem uent paper and bills- of ex
cnanee, (which latter are without doubt a par' ol tnei irculanng
paper of every tiading countiy, although iliey circulate moie
slowly than the other parts,) the system of colonial credit must
havealways mi own into the marker a veiy large portion ol ui
culatmgpaper *   Then, sir, when it is thusshown that the t>ei
mame Slates and Holland owe their prosperity to the paper sy s
tem and to credit, they will no longei be quoted against both
If there is one man en earth who knows when to use the
credit system, it is a German, whether ho is in Europe or
America, because he is a close calculator of number one If
he finds, after making his estimates, that he can easily repay,
he will then borrow money at six per «ent when he has con-
vinced his mind that he will make eight, or ten, or twelve, upon
its judicious use They do not want the Executive, or any one
else, to tell them how to make their estimates; they are the
safest calculators in the world
Some gentlemen here, from the Bouth, have advocated this
measure and the views oí the Executive—to destroy the bank
mg system of our country, to disconnect Government from the
banks, and to lestram the credit policy of the nation I have,
it is true, tiavelleo much through the South, the West, and the
N01 fh I have read much of all, and reflected anxiously on
their separate and blended interests, still I do not feel sufficient
confidence in myself to dissent too rashly from some of the
opinions which I have heard of members, who take, with an
air of confidence, the interest of their respective regions of the
country under their own protection I cannot, however, re-
strain the expiession of my doubts that the interest of the South
will be promoted by these measures, I honestly believe that
there is no part of the Union where capital is in such demand,
and credit so much required, as m the South—the cotton grow
ing regiens It may be true thet, in some of the old Southern
States—m South Carolina, tor instance, where capital is some
what fixed and established—those who receive large patrime-
nial possessions, with hands upon them to work them, and money
to carry them on, may do well in any vicissitude of our policy,
but less advantageously upon the new than the old system But
even that favored portion of the population of the States of the
South is comparatively but a small portion The great mass of
the cotton growers are men who have moderate means, and are
forced to extend then credit They may have a few thousand dol
lars and a few negroes After they shall have pui chased a planta-
tion, they will find their funds are exhausted, and that they must
resort to credit to get their establishment into profitable opera-
tion, and this is moYe especially the case of the Southwestern
States An editor in Mississippi, some time ago, said that that
Stale did not owe less than ten millions of dollars for negroes,
in other words, for labonng capital Now, require that State
to pay ten milliens in specie, and you would have to sell at
least one fourth of the State to make the amount, and that is
the most extensive cotton growing Slate in the Southern coun-
try
Sir, I maintain that this very productive labor, as it has been
called—the slave labor of the South—is strictly and truly mors
of capital than labor I could quote Lord Brougham and the
reasoning of Senator Tracy, to sustain the opinion, but 1 will
not read from either, foi I have not time to discuss it before
this almost exhausted committee, nor is it important for my
present purpose But, to come to the middle the gram grow
ing and agucultuial States how few of the number of then
inhabitants have been left farms, and utensils, and money, suffi-
cient to carry on the whole of the paraphernalia of farming ope
rations'* Nine out ef ten have to purchase farms, and to gam
credit foi their personal property, in order to carry them on
with prosperity "A farm," says Senatol Tracy, 're a real
manufactory," "a field is a real atensil, 01, if you please, a
6tore of first materials," to set it into profitable motion, you
must have capital, or credit to gam capital, in order to make it
useful or profitable
But if we were, as it is our duty, to turn our eyes and inquiry
farther north, where manufactures and fanning go hand in hand
together, a manufacturer builds his his factory, but finds that
his ability will not be sufficient to purchase all of the raw ma
terial to be worked up into useful and profitable fabrics. He
must either gain ci edit, 01 at once dismiss lus hands, and aban
don his useful enterprise, these hands must work in some
other and new employment, for a quartei of a dollai a day, in
steadof gaining a dollar, if the head of the factory could not
have obtained ciedit Thus, your system will prostrate the
man of some capital, and throw out of employment the man
who has but a useful trade
But how can you carry on commerce between man and man
without a sound convenible currency, without immense loss
to both the consumer and producer? Tracy has tiuly said
that "commerce and society ars one and the same thing,"
he has said in another place, "commerce is the whele of aocie
ty, as labor is the whole of riches •' The internal commerce
among the States and the people of the States is vastly greater
than its foieign commerce, and icquires some cueulating me
dium to repiesent value There lb not gold and silver enough
for this purpose then you are forced to have eilher a convert)
ble or inconvenible paper currency, or make the productions
ot labor a currency You had a convertible paper currency,
the best m the world, and the nation was happy and prosper
ous \ou taught the people tobe dissatisfied with it, and to
aid you in destroying it, and they aie now afflicted with an m
convertible depieciatmg currency To restore the formtr
prospeiity, you must restore the foimer cunencv
\ ou tell the people to banish from use small notes, and youi
measures force the People to countenance their existence   W e
had a good currency in Maiyland a few years ago    That htaie
piohibited the circulation of notes under five dolíais, and I be
Heve but one bank under their charters could issue notes of a
less denomination    Public necessity has been made paramount
to the law and the policy ol the State, and every corporation,
and almost every indivul 1 al in business feels himself auüiomed
to bteome a banker and to till the State with notes of the frac
tional parts of a dollar    This was the case m all the States, as
now, when the first Bank of the United Mates was destioyed
