Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDLOW,

Agent for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 13th instant is just received, and in part I have replied to it by telegram. The roll of paroled prisoners to which Mr. Fox refers as having been sent to me was forwarded to you in my letter of the 26th ultimo. Before delivering you my letter of the 20th May, inclosing orders on the subject of paroles, I consulted the General-in-Chief as to the application of these orders, and he decided that paroles then existing given since the publication of General Orders, No. 49, in violation of its provisions, should not be recognized except under some peculiar circumstances. (See my letter of the 9th of June). I inclose herewith the list of men captured and paroled by General Stoneman's command, referred to in that letter. I understand your letter to cover a little wider ground; that is, all paroles taken or given before the 22nd May, properly authenticated, will be recognized for exchange. The roll of paroled rebels received from the Navy Department and that from General Stoneman are the only rolls of the kind I have received.
