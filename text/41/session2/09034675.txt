Mr. pA\V ES. I move that the first reading
Ai • ** ln^rli:latioa be dispensed with
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Chairman, as this is the
last of the regular appropriation bills, I ask
the indulgence of the House, before proceed-
ing to the consideration of its various provis-
ions, for a few remarks in reference to the
matter of public expenditures. It seems not
inappropriate in the Committee on Appropri-
ations in bringing before the Committee of
(he Whole the last of the appropriation bills,
to review the work of the committee and the
work of the House, in view of what has trans-
pired heretofore, and seeing how well the com-
mittee have been able to carry out the reso-
lution with which they set out in this important
woik of limiting the appropriations to the
important and necessary expenditures of the
Government. However, before proceeding to
that review, I embrace this the earliest prac-
ticable moment to lay before the House some
statistics prepared by the Treasury Depart-
ment on a matter which at the time it occurred
excited much attention in the House and in
the country, and which gave rise to no little
severity of criticism as well as recrimination.
_ The House will recollect, Mr. Chairman, that
m some remarks I submitted at the early part
of the session I took occasion to compare the
estimates made by this Administration for the
coming fiscal year with the estimates made by
the past Administration for the present year,
furnished to tne House of Representatives i'or
their information, when I told the House that
the balance was alarmingly against the esti-
mates for the coming year. As I have said,
this attracted some attention and some remark,
and was denied in different quarters. Jt has
so happened, Mr. Chairman, that no two gen-
tlemen since that time have been able to agree
upon what was exactly the sum or amount of
estimates made by the last Administration for
this year and the amount of estimates made by
this Administration for the next year, every
gentleman commenting on them having a dif-
ferent sum total for the amount. The Treas-
ury Departmenfejias therefore felt justified in
employing one of its most skillful accountants in
stating the estimates for this year, made last
year, aud the estimates for next year, made
this year ; and the result of that investigation
1 take pleasure in laying before the House with
all its details:
