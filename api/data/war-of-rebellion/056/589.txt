Colonel G. W. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I send herewith a telegram just received from General Beauregard. I presume that a brigade should be sent, but would suggest Benning's instead of Anderson's. Anderson's is the stronger of the two and more remote from the railroad depot. Benning's is a fine brigade, though small, and I have no doubt will answer the purpose as well as Anderson's. Part of Anderson's is beyond the Lookout Mountain and Benning's entire brigade is near the Watkins house, which is much more accessible.

I remain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
