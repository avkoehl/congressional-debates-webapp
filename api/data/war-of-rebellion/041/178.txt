them a volley of musketry which drove them in altogether. To-night I shall keep up the shooting as during the last night and to-day.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Right Wing.

Major T. F. WILLSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-All quiet along my line.
HEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING,June 26, 1863.

SIR: I have to report that I prevented the work of the enemy last night. He has now four bales to work behind, but has made very little progress. The sharpshooters have been very active on my right. At 3 p. m. the fleet opened, and at the same time four field pieces and one or two mortars from the large breastworks. I have not yet received my reports from the different commanders as to casualties, but so soon as they come in, I will make a full report. All quiet on my left. I have sent a working party down to the right to repair damages, if any. I fear that I shall have to report the loss of many a brave man.

I remain, major, your obedient servant,

FRED'K B. BRAND,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Right Wing.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING,June 26, 1863.

SIR: I have to report that the enemy have torn up my breastwork a great deal. They are throwing at intervals 8 and 10 pounder mortar shells into Battery 11. My casualties are Captain [C. R.] Purdy (Fourth Louisiana), 1 private ([Calvit] Roberts' battery), and 3 privates (Miles' Legion) killed, and but 10 wounded. Colonel [M. J.] Smith assisted me very much by throwing shell into the enemy's works. I have three companies in Battery 11 armed with muskets, which I think is enough, but have only a few buck cartridges. All my officers and men behaved well. Major [J. T.] Coleman is in good spirits and a very hot place.

I fell certain that I will hold out.

I remain, your most obedient servant,

FRED'K B. BRAND,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Right Wing.

Major T. F. WILLSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SIR: I have to report that the batteries in my front have been keeping up a very sharp fire all along my right, injuring my breastworks a
