HEADQUARTERS FOURTH CORPS,Dalton, May 13, 1864-9.10 a. m.

General THOMAS:

I entered Dalton 9 a. m.; met enemy's cavalry at this place; and pushing them back. I will concentrate my command here and push on toward Resaca. Stoneman is covering the left and McCook the right. The railroads is entirely uninjured up to this point. I will make it a depot at once.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Two miles west of Resaca, May 13, 1864-12 m.

General HOWARD:

Your dispatch is received. Have the roads repaired to Dalton. Let the cavalry feel forward carefully, supported by infantry. If there be no detached forts at Dalton on the south front, select some good ground and prepare it for defense in case Johnston turns. I have not yet discovered if he be south of Resaca or not. I think he is about Swamp Creek. Keep your troops very light and feel to the right. I have a good force at the gap of Snake Creek. Communicate with me as often as possible. The passage of the gap was a slower process than I expected, and it has taken us until now to get out and up to Camp Creek, where skirmishing is now progressing.

I will fight for the railroad this afternoon. Tell Stoneman and McCook now to strike the retiring column of trains, burn all wagons, and secure the horses.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
