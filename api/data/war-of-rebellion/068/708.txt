HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 13, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Can you not ascertain precisely how many guns you have taken? I wish to issue an order, and I do not want to make a mistake.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864.

General MEADE:

It is not possible for me to tell at once what trophies have been captured by the corps. The artillery was taken to the rear, except some pieces loaned to artillery officers and 2 kept on the line. I suppose it would be safe to say 20. The colors are reported to be as many as 20; but I have had no time to collect them. It is now being done.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1 864.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-10.55 p.m.

General WILLIAMS:

GENERAL: The number of cannon captured and taken possession of is 18. Nineteen colors are sent here, with 3 captured May 6, 15 yesterday, and 1 this morning. Five other colors, captured in the Wilderness May 6 are in possession of General Birney and with the train, but will be sent in as soon as he can communicate with it. General Birney promises 5 other colors which were captured by his colonels yesterday, and sent by them to the train; many others are in the possession of individuals, but it is impossible to collect them at once. One of the colors captured yesterday appears to be an English Union Jack.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding
