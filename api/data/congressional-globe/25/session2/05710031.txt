APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOSE.
25rH  Cong--"2kd Sess.
Mr. Calhoun** Resolutions—-Mr Preston.
Semite 
there resolutions, when, from my knowledge of Se-
nators, I am firmly convinced that there are but very
few, if any, who aie not prepared to vote for resolu-
tions, prepared in such a conciliatory spirit, as not to
encounter the opinions or the prejudices of any, and
which ought to give, and I believe would give, entire
satisfaction to the South The moral effect of such
a unanimous, or almost ananmious, vote of the
Senate, would be great upon the country. It is,
therefore, for the pus pose of arresting this unpro-
fitable debate, and of having such resolutions re-
ported by a select committee, that I shall vote in
favor of the proposition
What have we witnessed upon the present occa-
sion? The Senators from Delaware, although re-
presenting a slavehcldmg State upon this floor,
have voted against these resolutions, because, m
their opinion, they can detect in them the poison of
nullification Now, I can see no such thing m
them, and am ready to avow that in the mam they
contain nothing hut correct political principles to
which I am devoted But what then1 These Se-
nators are placed m a false position, and are com-
pelled to vote against resolutions the object of
which they heartily approve Again my fnend,
the Senator from New Jersey, (Mr Wall,) votes
against them, because they aie political abstrac-
tions, of which he thinks the Senate ought not to
take cognizance , although he is as much opposed
to abolition, and as willing to maintain the consti-
tutional rights of the South as any Senator upon
this floor Other Senators believe the right of pe-
tition has been endangered, and until that has
been established, they will not vote for any resolu-
tions upon ihe subject Thus we stand, and thus
those of us in the North, who must sustain the
brunt of the battle, are forced into false positions
Abolition thus acquires force by bringing to its aid
the right of petition and the hostility which exists
in the North against the, doctrines of nullification
It is vain to say that these principio^ aie not really
involved in tae question This may be, and in my
opinion is, true, but why, by our conduct here,
should we aliord the Abolitionists such plausible
pretexts? The fact is, and it cannot be disguised,
that those of us in the Northern States who have
detsrmined to sustain the rights of the slaveholdmg
States at every hazard, aie placed in a most em-
barrassing situation We are almost literally be-
tween two fires whilst in front we are as'ailed bv
the abolitionists, our own ínends m Ihe South are
constantly driving us into positions where their
enemies and our enemies may gam important ad-
vantages Let us then saenfice forms if we can
obtain the substance
Now, sir, if a se'eel committee should be raised,
they might, I think, report three resolutions, which
would receive the almost unanimous vote of the
Senate.
What is the evil of which the Southern Slates
complain' Numerous abolition societies have been
formed throughout the Middle and Northern States,
and for what purpose1 It cannot be for the pur-
pose of effecting any change of opinion in the free
States on the suoject of slavery We have no
staves there, we never shall have any slaves there
The object cannot be to operate upon the slave-
holders, because the Abolitionists must know, every
person within the sound of my voice knows, that
their interference with this question has bound the
slaveholdmg interest together as one m in against
abolishing slavery in their respective Slates Be-
fore thts unfortunate agitation commenced, a very
large and grow mg party existed in seveial of the
slfve Stites in favor of the gradual abolition of
slav erj , and no v not a voice is. heard theie in sup-
port of sucn a m asure The Abolitionists have
postponed the emancipation of the slaves m three
or four States of this Union for at least half a cen-
tury They have, by their interference, produced
such a state of public opinion that no man within
these States would now be bold enough to raise such
a question before any of their Legislatures What,
then, is the purpose of these societies—I will not
say the purpose, for I cannot, and do not, attribute
to them such unholy intentions—but what is the di-
rect tendency of their measures? To irritate and ex-
asperate the feelings of the slaves; toholdoutto them
Trape notions and delusive ho$w of liberty to reft-
gitf^,,  ,),, y
der them discontented and unhappy, and, finally,
to foment servile msunection, with all its atten-
dant horror>, and to cover the land -with blood
However de-voted to the Union the South may be,
the cup of forbearance may yet be exhausted If
the father of a family be placed in such a deplora-
ble condition that he cannot retire to lest at night
without appiehension that before the morning his
house may be de\e oped in flames, and those who
are nearest and dearest to him may be butchered,
or worse than butchered, the gieat law of sL (-pre-
servation will compel him to seek security by what-
ever means it may be ob amed Nou ,sir, I have
long watched the progress of this agitation w i'h in-
tense anxiety, and I can say m solemn truth that
never before have I witnessed such a deep pervad-
ing and determined feeling as exists at present upon
this subject among the sober and reflecting men of
the South They love the Union, but if it's bles-
sings cannot be enjoyed but m constant fear of
their o«n destructio 1, necessity will compel then
to abandon it Such is now the south"rn feeling
The Union is now in danger, and 1 wi*h to pro-
claim the fact The biave man looks danger m
the face, and \inquines it, whilst the coward
closes his eyes at its appioach, and is o\ ei n helmed
The Union is dear to me as my heart'  blr od I
would peril life, charactei, and every earthly
hope, to maintain it, but Ihe best mode of preserv-
ing it is to warn it'friends of approaching danger
This I verily believe now exists, and that, too,
solely fiom the effoits of these abolition societies
I can fane; no ouVr cause winch could by possi-
bility endangci its existenc 
And if the Union snouid be dissolved upon the
question of si a ci}, what w ill be Hie consequences'
An entire non irteicourse uveen its different
parts, mutua' jealousies, and implacable war-.
The hopes oí the ñ ends of 1 bertv, in every c'imc,
would be 1 lasttd ind despotism might íegain hci
empne ovei tnc world 1 m°ht present m detail
the evils which vu ul 1 flow from disunion, tut I
forbear I shall not further lift the curtain TI e
scene noulrl betoo painful The good sense and
sound patriotism of the people of the North, when
once moused to the danger, will apply Ihe appro-
priate remedy Ihe peaceful influence of public
opinion will save the Union
The select committee might report a resolution
which would obtain the unanimous vote of the
Senate, declaring that neither the Congrcs of the
United States nor -my State, n any ombimtion
of individuals in any S'ale Ins any lioht to inter-
fere with the existence oi regulation of skveiv m
any other State w nere it is ree< gnised b> law
Even the Abolitionists themselves, so far as my
knowledge extends, have never denied this princi-
ple It Mas solemrly announced bv the first Con-
gress, and it is most clearly the doctrine of the
Constitution That instrument expressly recog-
nises the right to hold slaves as propeity in
States where slavery exists This, then, is not
a question of general morality, arTcclm" Pe
consciences of men, bit it is a question of con-
stituí oiiihw When the b ales became put esto
the Federal compact, they en cred into a solemn
agreement that propprty in slaves should be as invi-
olable as any other property Whi *t the Constitu-
tion endures, no hi m  n power, except th-t of tne
State within which Maverv exasis, has any right to
interfere with the question An attempt on the pait
of any other State, or of Congress, to violate this
right, woull be a palpable Violation of the Consti-
tution Congress might as well undertake to inter-
fere with slavery under a foreign Government, as
in any of the States where it now exist Í feel
confident that theio wo ud not be a sirg'e t1 s^-nt
ing voice raised in i íe Sena e agin si the idop io i
of such a resolution rs I have suggested
A second resolut on might assert the principle
that Congress ha' e no light under the Constitution
io prohibit the transfer of slaves by a citizen of one
State to a citizen of another State, when slav ery is
recogmspd by the laws of both The power " to
regulate conm rcr among the several Slates" can
never be construed into a power to abolish this
commerce Regulation w one thing, destruction
another. As long as slaves continue to be property
under the Constitution, Congress «night as welt un-
dertake to prohibit the people of Massaáfflsetís-
from selling their domestic manufactures la- SíRiflí
Carobna, as to prohibit the master of a'slave W
Virginia from disposing of him to lus neighbor  
North Carolina Both oases rest upon the same
principle of constitutional law The power to regu-
late does not imply the power to destroy. I be-
1 evs that such a «solution would encounter no se-
rious opposition in the Senate
Again, a third rt solution might be adopted m re-
gard to the abolition of slavery m the District of
Columb a, \< Inch would unite nearly every suffrage
in the Senate This District was ceded to the
United States by Virginia and Maryland At the
date of the cession, they were both slaveholdmg
States, and they continue to be so at this day
Does any man suppose, for a single moment, that
they would have ever made this cession, if they
had supposed that Congress would abolish slavery
in this Distnct of ten miles square whilst it existed
in their surrounding territories1 So long as it con-
tinues m these two States, it would be a violation of
the implied faith which we pledged to them by the
acceplance of the cession, to eonvert this very ces-
sion into the means of injuring aid deslrojing their
peace and security
if this District w ere free, it u ould become a city
of refuge for the Abolitionists It would be a se-
cure asj linn from whence they could scatter arrows,
firebrands, and death, throughout the slaveholdmg
Sates It would become the very centre of agita-
tion
The people of this District have viewed with
amazement and indignation the reiterated and per-
severing allompts which have been made by the
citizens of distant States to interfere in their do-
mestic concerns, and deprive them of their pro-
psitv They have protested agjmst this fore gn
ínteiiereiT-e wi h their i ght , but they have pro-
tested m vain Petitions still continue to flow in,
, ltiou h the petitioners ought to know that slaveiy
exists here in its mildest form, and that, if they
should be successful, there would not be a single
-lave left in the District upon which the ¡aw could
operate Before any bill for this purpose could
pass Congiess, all the slaves here would be sold
and <-ent away into the slave S ates, far fiom the
place of their birth and then afftciions. Success
in this attempt would thus pl?ct the slaves them-
selves in a worse condition than they are at pre-
sent
A resolution m ght, therefore, be adopted, in
accordance with the sp nt and tone of President
Van Buren s remarks upon this s ibject, in his ad-
mirable inaugmal address it might declare (hat
■> hiNt slavery exists in Maryland and Virginia, it
ought not, m the opinion of ir"  Senate, to be abo-
lished in the District of Columbia.
Thia committee ought to be most carefully se-
lected by the Senate It should be composed of
men whose opinions would command the greatest
weight througnout the country Every thing like
patty politics should be bamsbed from our delibe-
rations on this s< ij ct I -.hoi Id deem myself
guilty of moial treason, if, >n a ques ion which
maj tnd<jig r t e existence of the Union, I could
permit m\ conduct to be influenced by the petty
desire of obtainm  a party triumph Let the reso-
lution-, bo f r med in a most conciliatory spirit, and
let them be clo'ned m language which shall shock
the opinions of no Senator Provided the snb-
nance be letamed, I care not for the form Such
íesoiutions adopted by an almost unamPions vote,
might exert tb-h >ppiest rofjaence T^ev would
made a e'ear and a broad line of sep ution b 
tueer the friends of the Uni n on the n e Mde,
nd the Abohtion 's on the other 1 <n v c il i
fie the qu ^UoB from th« par j po'it < s c.  he ¿a},
and «ould rail/all the frwnds of the Constitution,
every where in then support
The Middle and Northern States are the field
upon which this great battle must be fought I
feai not, I doubt not, the result, if Senators from the
South, where the people are already united, would
but consent to adopt the counsels of those who must
bear the brunt of the contest
Mr. PRESTON was much averse to the pro-
posed reference, because it would occasion much
loss of time in going over, the same ground again.
