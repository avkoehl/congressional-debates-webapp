APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Fifteen Million Loan—Mr. Hunter.
Senate.
in the way of revenue for the present and next
fiscal year together.
For the next fiscal year, the Secretary has esti-
mated the expenses at $74,064,755. That was
his estimate in the annual report. Since then he
has sent in estimates for custom-houses and pub-
lic buildings to the amount of $1,704,000. These
together make an aggregate of $75,764,755 for
the probable expenses of next year. To that, it
will be proper to add the sum which Congress
usually allows by appropriations'originating here,
not upon estimates, but to satisfy claims and for
various other matters. This amount cannotbees-
timated with any accuracy, but it may be assumed
to be something like a million of dollars. We
think, though, that far more than a million of dol-
lars will probably be taken from the estimates of
$74,000,000 by the two Houses, who, in view of
the present state of the Treasury, are reducing
the appropriations below theestimates. This,at
least, has been done in the House of Represent-
atives, and these reductions, I suppose, will gen-
erally be sustained here. I will also say that in
this estimate of expenditure we throw outnearly
five million dollars for volunteers; for I suppose,
if the news from Utah be true, and I rely upon
it, that appropriation will nut bo necessary. I
take, then, the probable expenditures of the next
year, reckoning them according to the estimates,
as likely to amount to $75,764,755. To meet that
we shall have a balance on hand of $793,697.
The estimates for customs is $52,000,000; from
lands, §10.000,000; from miscellaneous sources,
$1,000,000; makingin all $63,793,697. Add to
that $15,000,000 by way of loan, if this bill should
pass, and the entire means for the next fiscal year
will be $78,793,697 upon that estimate, leaving a
surplus of something like thiee million dollars;
but if it should turn out that the news which we
have had in regard to the Utah difficulties, which
have undoubtedly swelled the general estimates
independently of the deficiency bill, be true, there
may be some reduction here. Indeed, I think
there ought to be.
Besides all this, if we were to pass a bill which
I introduced here upon leave, and referred to the
Post Office Committee, designed to make that a
self-sustaining Department, by adding a small
amount to the postages, we should relieve the
general expenditures of $3,500,000 of deficiency,
which is the sum now settled by the Post OOu-o
Department upon the geneial Treasury of ihe
country. But putting that out of the question,
it seems to me that there ought to be ground to
hope that, if the Utah troubles should ho soon
settled, we shall reduce the expenditures below
the $75,764,000 which arc estimated. 1 know that
the expenditure for the next fiscal year, on ac-
count of the Utah difficulties, no matter how they
terminate now, must be greater than they other-
wise would have been. Still, if we are to have
peace, and no disturbance there, I think the public
expenditures ought not to go to the sum which is
here estimated. I think so, because I find that
the entire expenditures for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1859, exclusive of the public debt, was
$64,878,000. 1 find that the entiic expenditure
for the last fiscal year of General Pierce's ad-
ministration, exclusive of the public debt, was
$60,172,000. I find that in the last annual report
of Mr Guthrie, as Secretary of the Treasury, he
stated that the average of expenditure, exclusive
of pubiic debt, for the five preceding years, had
been about forty-eight million dollars. 1 think
that with all this before us, we have a right to
hope that, if th&se disturbances shall be quieted,
we shall not only have some reduction upon the
estimate of $75,000,000 for the next fiscal year,
tyu that we have guod giounds for expecting a
much larger reduction for the years that are to
succeed.
Bat, Mr. President, it may be that the estimate
which I have made in regard to the probable
means of the Government for the next fiscal year
may be questioned. Let us see. First, in regard
to the lands. It is known that we have now ready
for advertisementand sale something like twenty-
three million acres of public lands m California.
They are the first, I believe, which have ever
been exposed for sale in that State, and it is sup-
posed they will be sought after with great avid-
ity. There is probable reason for supposing that
the sales in the older portions of the United States
will be quite as rapid as they have been for a num-
ber of years past. There seems, therefore, to be
good reason for estimating some ten or twelve
million dollars during the next year from public
lands—we put it at $10,000,000. In regard to the
customs, there are more elements to betaken into
consideration, and there is somewhat more reason
for doubt. I put them at $52,000,000, on the sap-
position that there may be a revival of trade in
the next year. I do this because I find that dur-
ing the last fiscal year the imports of dutiable
goods amounted to $294,160,835; from which we
are to deduct$10,59i,647 of goods reexported. 1
find, also, that the amount of goods in warehouse,
on the 1st of July, 3857, exceeded those in ware-
house on the 1st of July, 1856, some $20,802,390,
and it is fair to presume that these twenty mil-
lions were imported with a view to the consump-
tion of the succeeding fiscal year, and not for that
i closing in July, 1857. Making these deductions,
I the amount of dutiable goods entered for consump-
: tion, last year, was $262,766,798. If I have put
; the average rate of duty which experience, so far,
j has shown that we collect under the new tariff, that
! is nineteen and five twelfths per cent., that would
! have given us something like $51,000,000 for the
last fiscal year. 1 have had a calculation made
at the Treasury Department, based upon the first
two quarters of the present year; and I find that
taking the duties which were received, and the
amount of dutiable goods imported, the rate is
nineteenand five twelfths per cent. According to
that rate of duty, the dutiable goods imported m
1857 would have given us $51,000,000.
If it be said that the imports for the first two
or three quaiters of 1857 were larger than they
! would have been, on account of the expansion, I
, think it may be replied that it is obvious the im-
> pons for the last quarter were much less than they
would have boon, in view of the new tariff about
i to come in operation; but indeed, when we come
1 to compare the exports and imports, we shall find
that they did not much vary between that year
and the two years preceding it. I find, too, on
reference to the Department, that though the im-
ports have diminished very much for this year,
the difference between the exports for this fiscal
year and the last are not so great as would be
imagined. I behove the difference in the domes-
tic exports of this year and the last, for the first
three quarters, is not over thirty-five million dol-
lai s. I find, too, on reference to the crisis of 1837,
that although the imports and exports were very
.small for 18J8,-yet the succeeding year they in-
j creased very laigely; and that is to say, from
i $43,000,000 to $70,000,000. in addition, we have
i accounts that already large orders are going out
j for the fall business. Be that as it may, this esti-
i mate is founded on the supposition that we arc to
have a revival of trade and business in the next
year. If we should have it, I think if fair to sup-
pose that we shall derive a revenue of $52,000,000
from customs alone.
But, Mr. President, it may be said that even
this exhibition of revenue does not show that we
shall have the ability to meet the rate of expend-
iture which has been proposed for the present
fiscal year without some addition to the tariff, and
that all our sources of revenue can hardly be ad-
equate for such estimates of appropriation. Sir,
I am free to say that it will be some time, three or
four years, probably, before the existing sources
of revenue would meet an expenditure of sev-
enty-six or seventy-eight millions; but, at the
same time, I think it obvious that there ought to
be, and that there must be, a reduction in the ex-
penditures of the country. Why should we ex-
pend more than sixty million dollars per annum?
Why should we expend more than we expended
in the last year of General Pierce's administra-
tion ? Why should we expend more than was
expended the last fiscal year, which was only
$64,000,000? and I believe that the resources of
the country would soon enable us to meet an ex-
penditure even to that amount. For myself, I
believe, if there were proper economy, the ex-
penses of this Government for some time to come
ought to be reduced even below sixty million dol-
lars a year; but taking it at that rate, I think that
all the probabilities are in favor of the supposi-
tion that the existing tariff will soon yield us
enough of revenue, together with the proceeds of
the public lands, to cover all that.
I find, upon looking to the past, that, whenever
there has been a reduction of duties, a wonderful
impulse has been given to the export and to the
import trade of the country. The Secretary of
the Treasury estimates that the annual addition
to the exports and to the imports—for they amount
to about the same—after the tariff of 1846, for ten
years, was at the rate of ten percent. I find,
upon looking to it, that, for a period of nine years,
it was more than ten per cent. The exports, ex-
clusive of specie, in 1847, were $158,648,622. In
1856, the exports, including specie—and I include
it sincc the discovery of the mines in California,
because gold is as much an article of domestic pro-
duction and as fair a subject of export as wheat,
or corn, or tobacco, or cotton—were $326,964,908;
showing an increase in nine years of $168,316,286.
1 find that the imports, including specie, in 1847,
were $146,545,638; and, including specie, in 1856,
$314,639,942; showing a gam in imports, for
these nine years, of $168,094,304; thus showing
an annual increase of something like eleven per
cent.
But it may be said that this was in part owing
to the expansion of the credit system due to the
discovery of gold in California. I have gone
back to the period succeeding the passage of the
compromise bill, to see what was the effect of the
reduction of duties then; and the reduction there
was not so great as this. In 1833,1 find that the
exports were $69,950,856; and in 1841, at the end
of eight years afterwards, they were $103,636,236;
thus showing a gain of $33,685,380 in exports.
I find that, in 1833, the imports were $83,470,067,
and in 1841, $114,776,309; thus showing a gain
of $31,306,242, or something like six per cent, a
year.
If we take either ratio of increase, supposing
that the present tariff would give us $52,000,000
next year, we should find, taking either six, or
eleven, or ten per cent., as estimated by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, that the present tariff would
soon give us $60,000,000. Take it at ten percent.;
and it would increase $5,000,000 annually, and
two years would raise to $60,000,000. Take it
at an annnual increase of six per cent.; and less
than four years would raise it to that amount. But,
sir, it is fair, it seems to me, to suppose that we
should at least have the same relative increase in
exports and imports since the passage of the tariff
act of 1857, after the revival of trade, that we had
after the passage of the tariff of 1846, for the duties
arc still lower now than they were at that time;
and not only that, but the productive energies of
the country are constantly growing, and growing
at a ratio far exceeding the percentage of annual
increase in population. We know that cotton is
destined probably to command a high price, and
that its product is increasing rapidly. The same
may be said of tobacco; and the same may be
said of the bulk of the agricultural products,
although the prices have come down. The same
may be said of the export of domestic manufac-
tures. In order to verify this, I ask the attention
of the Senate to a comparison of the exports of
cotton, tobacco, and manufactures, under high
and under low duties.
In 1847, immediately after the tariff of 1846
went into operation, the exports of tobacco were
$7,242,086, and in 1857 they rose to $20,206,772;
nearly threefold. In 1847 the exports of cotton
weie $53,415,848, and in 1857 were $131,575,859;
greatly more than twofold. The exports of do-
mestic manufactures in 1847 were $10,351,364;
and in 1857, $30,805,126; nearly threefold. I find,
too, that in 1845, in the State of Massachusetts—
I take her as the true exponent of the manufac-
turing interest—the value of the cotton manufac-
tures was $19,237,966; and in 1855 they were valued
at $36,464,738; an increase of more than eighty
per cent.% In 1845, in Massachusetts, there were
employed in the manufacture of cotton, twenty-
three thousand and eighty-eight hands; and in
1855 there were thirty-six thousand five hundred
and eighty-eight; an increase of about sixty per
cent. In woolens, in that State, the value man-
ufactured in 1845 was $11,361,260; and in 1855,
$15,124,233. The hands employed were, in 1845,
nine thousand four hundred and ninety; in 1855,
thirteen thousand and twenty-two.
