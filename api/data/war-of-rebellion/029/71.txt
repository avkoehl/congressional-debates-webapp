No. 18. Report of Major James W. Hewitt, Second Kentucky Infantry.

CAMP MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., December 9, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report, in pursuance of your orders, I formed my regiment on the left of the Ninth Kentucky, opposite the enemy's camp near Hartsville, a portion of General Morgan's cavalry being at the same time on my left. When the order came for me to advance, of the ground was such that I deemed it advisable to deploy my regiment, and therefore gave the order to deploy. In this was we drove the enemy from their first camp, and continued to drive them until they surrendered.

The officers, without an exception, behaved in the most gallant style. They were continually in advance of their men, urging them forward, and where all behaved so well it would be impossible to particularize. Each seemed to vie with the other in deeds of gallantry. The whole command, I am pleased to say, behaved in a most unexceptionable manner.

I cannot conclude my report without referring to Color-Sergt. John Oldham, whose conduct and carriage during the whole engagement elicited the encomiums of both officers and men.

Appended is a list of killed, wounded, and missing, all of which I respectfully submit:

Killed................................................. 8

Wounded................................................ 54

Missing................................................ 3

Total.................................................. 65

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES W. HEWITT,

Major, Commanding Second Kentucky Regiment.

Colonel THOMAS H. HUNT.
