Major MYERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Wytheville, Va.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report the arrival of my command at this place at 12 m. to-day, making a march of sixteen miles. General Breckinridge's telegram, directing me to report, &amp;c., was received. I inclose herewith a report* giving the organization and battalion commanders. I have temporarily consolidated Colonel Giltner's and my own brigade, which, I think, will be satisfactory to the command and certainly render it more efficient. Up to this time have heard nothing definite at to the present position of Lieutenant-General Early.

I am, sir, respectfully,

G. B. COSBY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
