THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 20,
Mr. STEWART. At what rate of speed?
Do you regulate that?
Mr. HENDERSON. Yes, sir; that is all
regulated.
Mr. STEWART. Row?
Mr. HENDERSON. If you will only listen
to the amendments) you will find that that is
all provided for.
Mr. MORRILL. That is all there is in this
bill. The Senator who has charge of the bill,
it seems, anticipating that they might not ac-
complish this work, and that thus it.would fail
utterly, and there would be no connection
across the city if they did not do it, author-
ized# this other company, the Baltimore and
Ohio company, to do it. That amendment is
withdrawn. The only question, therefore, is
whether we will authorize this company to di-
verge their line east of the Capitol, through a
tunnel, and make a connection off here with
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and in the
mean time grant them the authority to run
their cars by steam in front of the Capitol,
which they have no authority to do now. I
understood it to be the sense of the Senate,
on a former occasion, that we would authorize
them to do that temporarily, until they could
make this connection; and we have made this
bill, as we understood, in conformity with the
former judgment of the Senate. That is all
there is of it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. _ The next
amendment reported by the committee will be
read.
The Secretary read the next amendment,
which was in section [three] two, lines six and
seven, to strike out the words " Sixth street,
and also at its intersection with;" so that the
section will read:
Sec. 2. Andbe it further enacted. That the provisions
of sections three and four of the act to which this is
an amendment shall be applicable to the extension
-f said road or ttacks as hereby authorized, and that
it shall be lawful lor said company to construct a
Ji,)w or otfccr bridcc across the Washington canal at
its intersection with D street south, of such plans and
aiioensions as may be approved by the corporation
of Washington, and so as not to interfere with the
navigation of said canal. And also to usesteam power
in the transportation of passengers and freight over
said railroad and branches, subject, however, to such
restrictions and regulations as may be imposed by the
corporate authorities of the city of "Washington in
respoct to such portion thereof as may be located in
said city.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to insert as section
three the following:
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted,< That the consent
of Congress be, and the same is hereby, granted for
a period of twelve months from the passage of this
aet to the Alexandria, Washington, and Georgetown
Bailroad Company to use steam power in drawing
the cars of said company on the struetur^cross the
Potomac river erected by said company under the
provisions of the act entitled "An act to extend the
charter of the Alexandria and Washington Railroad
Company, and tor other purposes," approved March
3,1863, and along the railway now laid by said com-
pany, or which may be hereafter laid, under thopro-
visions of the said act, along Maryland avenue and
I-irst street west, in the city of Washington, to the
present depot of tho Washington branch of the Bal-
timore and Ohio railroad, subject always, and in all
particulars, to such restrictions and regulations con-
cerning the use of such steam power as the corpora-
tion of the city of Washington may. by its ordinances,
at any time impose on the railroad company: Pro-
vided, That the said company shall not propel their
engines at a greater rate of speed than five miles per
hour within the corporate limits of Washington city.
Mr. NYE. I suggest to the gentlemen hav-
ing this bill in charge that that time had better
be made eighteen months instead of twelve.
As suggested by the Senator from Pennsylva-
nia, at the end of twelve months Congress will
not be in session. Nobodj? expects that this
tunnel will be completed in twelve months;
and it will be but fair to have this privilege
expire during the session of Congress, so that
they can renew it if they desire to do so.
Mr. HENDERSON. I have no objection
to that.
Mr. NYE. I move then to amend the
â€¢amendment by striking out "twelve" and
inserting "eighteen."
The amendment to the amendment was
agreed to.
The amendment, as amended, was adopted.
The next amendment was to strike out the
fourth and fifth sections of the bill, as follows:
Sec. 4. And be it further enacted. That the said rail-
road- company shall be required to pay any and all
damages that may result to private property from the
extension of said road, and the tunneling under the
several lots and squares of ground as heretofore pro-
vided ; and that in the event the owner or owners of
such property and the said company cannot agree as
to the amount of such damages, or the value of any
private property so appropriated for the purposes of
such extension of said road, such proceedings shall
thereupon be had for the appropriation and assess-
ment of the damages thereof as are authorized and
required under the laws now in force in the District
of Columbia regulating appropriations and assess-
ment of damages for opening roads, streets, and alleys
in said District. That upon thepaymentto the owner
or owners of the amount of such award of damages,
or the lawful tender thereof, together with the pay-
ment of all costs of such proceedings, the said com-
pany shall acquire the right to use and occupy for the
purposes of said railroad all such lands so appropri-
ated, in such a manner as may be necessary for the
proper working and running said road.
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That if at any
time any other railroad company shall or may de-
sire to use and occupy the said tunnel so authorized
by this act, either on the same track or another one
alongside thereof, any such company shall have the
right to do so upon such fair and reasonable terms as
may be agreed upon by said parties to such joint oc-
cupancy. In case parties cannot agree on terms, the
supreme court of the District of Columbia shall fix
the terms.
The amendment was agreed to.
Thebill was reported to the Senate as amended
and the amendments were concurred in, and
ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read
a third time. It was read the third time and
