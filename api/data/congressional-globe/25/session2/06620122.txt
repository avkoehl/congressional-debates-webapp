"Having thus established the lespr-nsihihty of the Bank of
Enelail, and having previously shown the causes of its total
unfitness toi the ofhee with which it has been entrusted by the
State, it would seem that the very statement of the natuie of the
disease, would suggest its remedy This remedy can only
consistm depriving the bank entirely of the powers which
it exeicises oier the cuuency ol the country, and placms
thi.se in otliCi and ies¡.onsible hands

i<= pi eferrcd of the late Administration in 1 elation to the currencyÍ
The only me «.mes designed to opeiate on the cunency, weie
two, the une to mutase'the specie,and the other through the
levenueti induce the deposite banks to dimmish their papere
issues, and diaconfmm the 1 sue of small bills And which if
the^e orv\as it the ui Hed influence of the two, that htsde
ranged th" bank note currency' i  decide this question, we
mint inquire \ Int has been, an 111 tlir difhiulfy with the banks'5
Iht difuuiity i-= that they lta\e extended their loans and their
Visue-i *oo much This i* not, and cannot be denied Jlutthe
pohcj of the \diruni=tiaiion wt« to dimmish their issue* , ami
inctea^e the specie m the couatry, which mieht ioima basis for
their issues How then can it be said, that this policy of the
Admimstiatioii conduced to the disoider of the bank pap<r
cuirencyí Ooe oi these measures, the increase oí specie
succeeded, the other, the diminution of paper did not sue
ceed But the Administration had no powei over that sub
ject, it could not control the State banks, it did not attempt to
control them( it only sought to reform them, or make it for
their interest to dimmish their issues In that it failed; the
banks went on to extend, and expanding their paper issues,
until they finally exploded And, therefore, it is contended,
that because the Administration could not restrain the baRfc 
in their headlong carieer, it is responsible for all the^disorders
which have ensued la thissound lessoning? la ithonesf1 I*et
us take a parallel case to illustrate it We have in most parts
of the country, temperance societies, which, ! heüeve, have
¿one much good Some of them aim at total abstinence from
all strong cTrmks, others at abstinence m a more limited sense,
Theu efforts have succeeded to a cettain extent; but to make
the cases more parallel, let us suppose that their Jaudableex-
eitions had entnely failed,and thatintempeiance had mcieased
íatherthan decreased since these societies weie formed Accord
ingto the reasoning applied to the cuirency, these societies are
responsible foi this mciea&e of intern peí anee, they are the cause
of it, they have been trying "expeiiments" with temperance,
they have been "tampering" mth it If they had not inter
fered with it, if they had not attempted to íestiam this beastly
vice, it would have prevailed less Their ''expenmeats." 011
sobriety have increased debauchery, and if a wor hless sot is
seen drunk m thestieets, you must reproach the temperanco
societies, and say to them, behold the glorious results of your
expenments, And tampeting with tern peí anee
Such is the absurdity of that reasoning by which many of
(lie people of this country have been deceived and deluded
into the belief that it was the measures of the Administration
which blew up thepapei bubble so that it has burst
Theie is no escape from this view oí the subject, unless it be
contended that the increase of specie has been the cause of the
papei expansion And such has been the infatuation, that#
some who have been the most rabid- m relation to paper mo-
ney, have maintained a proposition so preposterous It would
be trifling with the common sense of the country to discuss
such a question I will, however, give the opinions of two dis-
tinguished men on this pointj who ought to be good authority
with the bank pariy, as they were the advocates of a National
Bank, and theu opinions are taken from the very leports out of
which the fust and second National Bank onginated. In his
report recommending th© first bank, m 1790, Alexander Hamil-
ton says
"liut the last and heaviest charge is still to be examined this
ib, that banks tend to banish the gold and silver of the country.
"The mo-it common answer given to this is, that the thing
supposed is of little or no consequence, that it is immaterial
what selves the purpose of money, whether paper, 01 gold, or
silver, that the effect of both on industry is the same
''This auswei is not destitu'e ofsolidity, although not entirely
satisfactoiy The positive and permanent increase of the pre-
cious metals in a oomttiy, can haidlyevcr be a mattei ofinchi-
feience As the commodity taken in lieu of every other,
í-í a spencfeof the mobt effective wealth, as the money of the
wuitu, his olgre.it concern to the State that it possess a suffi-
ciency of it to face any demands which the piotection of its ex-
ternal niteiests may create "
In his cuuency report in December, 1815, Mr ¡Secretary Dal-
las says
"But it is within the ^cope of a wise policy to c/en/ean addi-
tional demand for coin, and in that way to multiply the induce-
ments toimpoilaiid ret tin the metals of which it is composed.
1 or instance the txcc^ive is^ue of bank papei has usurped the
place of the national money, and under such circumstance?,
gold and silvei will always connnue tobe treated as an article
of meiehmdise but it ie hoped that the issue cf bank paper
will boon he 1 educed to its pist share m the circulating medium
of the country, and consequently that the coin oí the United
States will receive its legitimate capacity and chaiactei.
"And finally, &uch regulations may be imposed upon the
exportation of gold an<£siloei^ as will serve m future to fix
and let im the quantity required for domestic uses "'
The measmes foi increasing the metallic cunency consisted
of the act of 18.54, raising the standard of gold com, m importing
gold foi fiench and Neapolitan indemnities, and the laws for
increasing the operations of the Mint, and establishing blanch
Mints A hese measures have been eminently successful, and
increased the specie m the countiy from twenty two millions
to more than eighty millions of dolíais
We have noticed the only measuies of the late Admmisua-
tion designed to operate- on the currency and to improve its
soundness, oi, to usp the language of some, to give the country
a "better currency " But theie have been other measuiea,
which ate alleged to have had an injurious operation on the
bank note cum ncy Ihe puncipal of these aie rheiefusal to
rechanet the United State Birk and the leuvnal of the re
venues from that institution to the «¡tate bank* I will stiomit
a lew íemaikson cichof the«e mea&u.es In regard to the
firu, it ja a sufficient auswei 10 say, that although the bank was
not lechailored byCongie^, it, unfoitimately Iji the country,
obtained a chartei fiom Pennsylvania, andi was declared by
its prcMi'tut thit it was "safer and stronger ' under its new
charter thin it had cvubeen This wes thought, at the time,
to be a meie act of boasting on the pai t of the pi esident, but
experience has fuUy confirmed us truth The piesent attitude
of that bank, its agencies in this countiy and m Europe, show
that it has probably at this moment more power o%er the mone-
tary affairs of the countiy, than it evei had at any former pe-
uod now, then, has ihe refusal to lecharter that bank tended
to derange the paper and ciedit svstem? If the bank had
wound up usifidii-, as it ough* tn have done, and the present
difficultitshddoccurred, theie might have been some grounds
for tbis charge, but as it ib, thete aie none
But it is alleged that the íefn^al to íechartei this incorpora-
tion has been the puncipal cause of the rapid multiplication of
State bank-', and consequent expansion of the paper and credit
system    It i*a little eYtraoidniaty that this argument should
be un?ed by the 11vocate^ of that system, and of its extension
But is tbeieany soundness m the aigumenfi   It 1 este on two
a^sumpt'on*  ore, that a Natienal Bank will prevent the multi-
plication oí fetate banks andthaofhet that itwili regulate and
restrain   their   i-^ues    These assumptions are unsupported
either by piimcipk or expedience, bul are in the face of both. If
aNationa1 Bank tnll prevent the incie seof Smte banks, why
has1 tint done so?   \Veha\e had a National Bank since 17$,
with the except on of five or six Tears, yet there has been, dasr-*-
ingiuis-fthole penod a constant mci ease of Sta'e irisututiori&r"
¿ac/s aie of some htt'e lmporfance in this natter, and what
arp iheyi   When thehrst United ¡states Bank was estahhshedis,
1791, there were but foui State banks, with a capital of a little
over two million* this appears from the report Of Alexander
Hamilton    In 1811, when thechaiter of that bank expired,
