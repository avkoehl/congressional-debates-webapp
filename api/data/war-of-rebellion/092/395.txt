line, dismounted. We soon found the enemy strongly posted behind barricades in greatly superior numbers. We at once charged them, driving them from their successive line of barricades, routing them in wildest confusion, they throwing away their arms and whatever else would impede their flight, many seeking safety behind trees and under houses, leaving their killed and wounded in our hands. My regiment captured some 40 prisoners, among whom was a major and a lieutenant. We lost in this action 3 men killed and 6 men. Until the 8th instant nothing of moment occurred. On the 8th we had a skirmish with the enemy without casualty. We remained in lirly all night. On the morning of the 9th we crossed Ebenezer Creek, leaving one battalion, under command of Captain Becker, at the bridge to guard the pioneers while they destroyed the bridge and blockaded the road. While thus employed they were fired upon by the enemy's sharpshooters, wounding one man. From the 10th to the 20th instant nothing worthy of report occurred.

I have destroyed during the campaign 29 gin houses and gins, containing about 1,460 bales of cotton, and 1 flouring mill and 1 saw-mill. We captured 106 horses and 94 mules.

The casualties of my regiment are 5 killed, 12 wounded, and 12 missing, making a total of 29 men.

The conduct of both my officers and men on all occasions in worthy of the highest praise.

Respectfully submitted.
