RICHMOND, VA., November 30, 1864.

General BEAUREGARD,

Macon:

For the present emergency your command will extend eastward to the sea-coast. Your minute knowledge of the low country will enable you to dispose of the forces operating against Sherman, as well as those defending the coast, so as more effectually to retard the advance of Sherman and the junction of the enemy.

By order of the President:

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

SAVANNAH, November 30, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The enemy yesterday landed at two points, threatening Grahamville and Coosawhatchie, on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. All available forces have been drawn from Charleston for defense of those places, and General Smith, who arrived in the night with 1,200 Georgia State troops, was sent at once to the threatened point. Operator at Grahamville this morning reports enemy 5,000 strong, and still landing from transports.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAHAMVILLE, November 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE:

The enemy have extended both their wings, and are evidently in force Fight still progressing. The troops have not arrived. We shall need re-enforcements.

G. W. SMITH,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., November 30, 1864.

General TAYLOR,

Savannah, GA.:

Yours of this date received. When General Beauregard leaves Macon for the East you will be necessary in the West. The enemy's purpose is not so fully developed as to determine his operations.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

NOVEMBER 30, 1864-11. 30 A. M.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER:

Thank you gallant old command in my name for their brilliant services. I promised it in advance to the people of your native city, and nobly have you redeemed my pledge. General Robertson has arrived and is doing well, though he will be long disabled.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
