APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 10,
Ho. of Reps.
Reduction of the Army —Mr. Logan.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
lie is hereby, authorized to appoint, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, ono major gen oral
and two brigadier generals in addition to tlie present
military establishment: Provided, That when the war
with Mexico shall be terminated by a definite treaty
of peace, duly concluded and ratified, the number of
major generals in the Army shall bo reduced to one,
and tho number of brigadier generals shall be re-
duced to two; and tho President of the United States
13 authorized and directed to select from tho wholo
number which may then be in office, without regard
to the date of thoir commissions, tho number to be
retained, and cause tho remainder to be discharged
from the service of the United States."
This has been the custom from the organi-
zation of oar Army in 1791 down to the present
time.
So it appears that we have mustered out
heretofore generals, colonels, majors, captains,
and everybody else not necessary for the ser-
vice. We did so after the war of the Involu-
tion ; we did so after tho war of 1812. And
in tho law providing for mustering out the
extra generals Congress passed a provision
giving a gold medal to each of the major gen-
erals, together with the thanks of Congress for
their services. But, nevertheless, they were
mustered out of the service when they were no
longer needed. They did not complain, nor
did any one else blame the Government for
doing so. Now, if we run muster out generals
wo can muster out captains, and if we can
muster out captains we can muster out gen-
erals, because they both hold office by the
same tenure, and the one 13 as much entitled
to remain in service, if his services are needed,
as tho other. How many major generals, brig-
adier generals, colonels, &c., had vm in the
Army when the war of 1801 commenced? 1
will give the list. 1 call the attention of the
House and tho country to the fact that at dif
ferent times ami in different wars we have had
different numbers of major generals, brigadier
generals, li-e.. in the Army organization. Iri
1800, before the rebellion, tho Army had been
reduced to a peace basis. Let me therefore
call the attention of the House to a compari-
son between the number of officers and men
in the Ai my before the war of 1861 and the
present peace establishment.
In 1800 how many generals had we in tho
Army of the United States? There was no
General of the Army, no Lieutenant General.
There, were, but one major general, throe brig-
adier generals, and one brigadier general of
the staff
In 1809 there were, 1 believe, IS regiments
in the Army, with 12.931 men. Liow is it to-
day? In 13110 and 3 870 we have an Army of
"7,1)0!) men and ofiicers. What, is the propor-
tion of oilioers to men in 1870? There are now,
as 1 said, 07,90!) men, f General, 1 Lieutenant
General, f> major generals, 8 brigadiergouerals
now in service, and 2 vacancies, making 10
brigadier generals authorized by law, besides
8 brigadier generals on the staff, and 8 or 10
major generals and brigadier generals on the
retired list; making in all, not counting these
retired officers, 18 brigadier generals in our
Army, 5 major generals, 1 Lieutenant Gen-
eral, and 1 General. Such is the condition
of things at this time.
Now, let us compare this ratio of officers to
men with what it was in 1800. In the latter
year the Army was organized on a certain basis,
with a force numbering, say, 13,000 men, and
the proportion of generals was 1 to ■>% regi-
ments. To-day it is 1 general to ljj- regiments.
In 1860 we had but one general officer to
3,233 men ; in 1870 we have one general officer
to 1,030 men. That is the proportion of gen-
erals to men. Now let me call the attention
of tho House to the staff corps of the Army.
I assert here to-day, and I can prove it from
the records, that the staff of our Army, con-
sisting of 37,000 men, is as large as the French
Government lias with an army of 600,000, or
the Russian Government with an army of
800,000. In 1860 there were 13 officers in the
adjutant general's department; in 1870 there
are 20 officers, or .a difference of 7. In 1880
there were 2 officers in the inspector general's
department; in 1869 and 1870 we have 9 offi-
cers, or a difference of 7. In I860 there was
1 officer in the Bureau of Military Justice ; in
1870 we have 10 officers iu that bureau, or a
difference of 9. In 1860 there were 44 officers
in the quartermaster general's department;
in 1869 and 1870 we have 80 officers in that
department, or a difference of 42. In 1860
there were 11 officers in the subsistence depart-
ment ; in 1870 we have 29 in that department,
or a difference of 18. In 1860 there were 107
officers iu the medical department; in 1809
and 1870 we have 222 in that department, or a
difference of 115.
Mr. BUTLEft, of Massachusetts. The gen-
tleman will allow ine to suggest that there arc
more than 300 contract surgeons.
Mr. LOGAN. I am aware of that. I am
speaking now of the officers who have rank in
the Army other than contract surgeons. In
the pay department in 1860 there were 28 pay-
masters ; in the same department in 1869 we
have 05 paymasters, making a difference of 37.
In the engineer corps in 1860 we had 89 ofii-
cers ; in the engineer staff of 1870wehave 114.
In the ordnance department in 18G0 there were
55 officers; in that department in 1870 we have
77, making a difference of 22. Of post chap-
lains we have 30, wherein 1860 there were none.
There is tho difference.
Now, there is a staff corps numbering how
many? The staff of our Army in 1800 amounted
to 350 officers; in 1869 it amounts to 003;
being an addition of 313.
Now let mo give you the rank of tho staff
corps of tho Army? In 1809 wo had 1 brig-
adier general ; in 1809 wo have 8; a difference
of 7. Of colonels in tho staff corps we had in
1860, 11 ; in 1809 we have 29; a difference of
18. Of lieutenant colonels we had 10; now
we have 42; a difference of 32. Of majors,
there were in 1800, 75 ; in 1809 wo have 200;
making a difference of 125. In I860 we had
160 captains ; in 1869 there arc 131. Strange
to say, there are fewer captains in the staff corps
to-day than there were when our Army was
much smaller. Tho explanation is that the
difference is made up by the number of surplus
majors, lieutenant colonels, colonels, and brig-
adier generals. In 1800 we had 30 lieutenants
in the staff corps ; in 180!) there are 25. There
arc fewer lieutenants as well as captains nmv
than we had in 1860; but the number of brig-
adier generals, colonels, and majors are in-
creased to make up for the difference.
I want to call the attention of the country
to this matter, because the figures I am now
giving have probably never been given to the
House or the country before. 1 am giving
them from the record. I want to call atten-
tion to this enormous staff corps and tho man-
ner in which our Army is organized, so that
the House may decide whether some measure
of reduction is not urgently demanded.
What is the proportion of the o0icers of the
Army as compared with tho number of the
men? There is one commissioned officer to
every 10 men, and one non-commissioned
officer to every 0 men. You have either a
general, a colonel, a captain, a major, or some
other commissioned officer over every ten men
belonging to the Army of the United States.
Who ever heard of such a thing before ? You
may take the French army, tho English army,
the Prussian army—you may take all the armies
of the world, and 1 tell you that in none of
them will you find any fewer than 20 men to
a commissioned officer. That is the least num-
ber in any army in the world except our own.
Here we have 1 commissioned officer for every
10 men, and 1 non-commissioned officer for
every G men. In our Army it takes two officers
and about one third to run ten men.
Let me compare the staff corps of f'oruVi
armies with that of our own. It has been
stated that this work of the Military Commit-
tee is "spite work." 1 intend to show this
Congress and the country that this is a just
and proper work, that wo propose no more
than ought to be done for tho reduction of
tho Army to the proper standard. Let us
compare, I say, the staff corps of foreign
armies with that of our own. Our staff corp.-!
numbers to-day 003 officers, 8 of them with
the rank of brigadier general, and only a few
of them lieutenants. Our whole Army com-
prises only 37,000 officers and men. In Russia
the size of their army is 800,000, and tho size
of their staff corps is 800, a little over one half
of what we have for 37,000 men. In Prussia
the staff corps is 100 for an army of about
400,000 men. In Austria they have 365 staff
officers for an army of 600,000 men. In Italy
305 for an army of 300,000 men. In France
the staff corps is 580 officers for an army of
600,000 men. Hence you will see by com-
parison that we have more staff corps with
our small Army than any other army in the
world or that ever did exist. Yet if any one
undertakes to touch our Army, to prune it
down or to do what is right and proper to
make the staff corps what it should be, he is
denounced all over the country as making war
upon the men who fought for the existence of
the Government.
This great difference between our staff corps
and tho staff corps of other armies is caused
thus: yon have to graduate a man at West
Point to make him a quartermaster. Think of
it! In order to make a man competent to issue
shoes, boots, pork, sugar, molasses, and coffee,
you have to educate him iu engineering and
in artillery, cavalry, and infantry tactics at
West Point! Whatanabsurdity! IntheFrench
army they take clerks from stores and other
men accustomed to business to do the work
done by commissaries. They form what is
called the " corps of military intendants." It
is not necessary to have military men to buy
and distribute commissary stores. In Franco
these ofiicers arc civilians, and the French army
is the best organized army in the world, while
we have Army officers of high rank in the staff
acting as shop-keepers.
Then again, sir, if you put a man in the
quartermaster's department to take charge of
it you must make a brigadier general of him.
Urigadier general of what? Of boots and shoes,
coats, tents, wagons, and mules. If you put
a man iu charge of the commissary depart-
ment you have to make him a brigadier general.
Brigadier general of what? Of beef and molas-
ses and pork and beans.
A Member. Brigadier general of bean soup.
[Laughter.]
Mr. LOG-AlS. Yes, sir; the gentloman is
right, abrigadiergeneralof bean soup. [Laugh-
ter.] That is the condition of our Army to-day.
We have officers in the Army doing duty with
high rank who ought to give way for civilians
who understand the duties of the positions
much better and whose employment would not
be one half so expensive.
Let me refer to another difference between
our Army and the armies of other great nations.
In other armies they have no such thing as a
corps of paymasters. The captains and ser-
geants of the companies pay the men, and the
duty is done well so far as I can learn. The
quartermaster, commissary, and pay depart-
ments are all consolidated. Duties which wo
have discharged by separate officers of high
rank are there performed by one class of men
who do the duty well.
That is the reason we have such a cumber-
some organization. We have now a staff corps
almost iarge enough for a million men. But
the moment we touch one of these men tho
whole Washington army is down on Congress
