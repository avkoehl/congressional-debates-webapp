HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION CAVALRY,Monday, September 19, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Pursuant to orders received last night, the First Brigade of this division started at 3.15 a.m. to report to Brigadier-General Kautz, leaving their picket-line established, taking 1,000 men. At 4 a.m. I dispatched a force to patrol the Jerusalem plank road as far as Proctor's farm, and also a party from Gary's Church to move in the direction of Reams'. Neither of these have as yet reported back. My pickets report all quiet. A small party of dismounted men approached my outside vedettes on the Weldon railroad soon after daylight and asked for an exchange of papers; said they would not fire, if our men would not, and fell back. I will forward reports from the patrols as soon as received.

Respectfully,

H. E. DAVIES, JR.,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 19, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL;I forward herewith report received* this a.m. from General Kautz, from which it appears that the brigade sent him this a.m. is now engaged in ascertaining the position and movements of the enemy. From his reports of his present force and his picket-line, I presume he has been unable to use more than that brigade in moving after the enemy while keeping up his picket-line. Colonel Stedman commands the brigade sent him.

Respectfully,

H. E. DAVIES, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 19, 1864-12.45 p.m.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Commanding Cavalry, Army of the Potomac:

I inclose you copy of dispatch# just received from General Kautz, from which it appears that the force sent him this a.m. has not been used for the purpose of looking after the enemy reported to be in the vicinity of Sycamore Church. It was expected that you would give the necessary instructions to General Kautz, as he is under your orders and receives instructions from these headquarters direct only when some emergency requires it. He was advised by me last night that you would re-enforce him for the purposes specified, so that he might be prepared in time, as, from the distance between you, he could not be if
