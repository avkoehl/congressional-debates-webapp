WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., May 30, 1862.

Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

The Paymaster-General will order the troops to be paid as you request. Yesterday I answered your telegram as follows, in substance:

The President first directed three-months" men and militia to be received. Upon consideration he limited the call to volunteers for three years or during the war, and to such actual existing military organizations as were armed and equipped and ready for immediate service. The latter would be received for three-months" service, and volunteers for three months to guard prisoners would also be received.

On inquiry the telegram appears to have been directed to Chicago instead of Springfield. Please acknowledge this and favor me with any suggestions you may have.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., May 30, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch is satisfactory, except I desire to know how many men Illinois shall raise for the three-years" service. Shall I receive all who offer?

RICHARD YATES,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., May 30, 1862.

Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

We will receive all the three-years" men you can raise.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
