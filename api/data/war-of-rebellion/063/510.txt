HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., May 8, 1864.

Colonel HARRISON,Commanding at Fayetteville, Ark.:

Communicate with Major Hackett, commanding at Cassville, and ascertain when the train will leave Cassville for your post, and arrange to have at least one squadron of your command to meet it a little this side of Cross Hollow, where the attack will probably be made. My forces are now so disposed that I cannot furnish an escort of more than 60 men forward from Cassville.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, May 8, 1864-6.10 p.m.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN:

There have been no guerrillas at Wellington. It was reported last night that a party of 180 rebels were coming into Wellington. Report proves to be incorrect. Ten or 12 bushwhackers crossed the river and robbed some stores in Camden last night. I cannot tell where Major Mullins is. I have called out two companies of citizen guards. Have detachments of Companies G, F, and H, First Cavalry, here. The whole thing is about to prove a scare, nothing more.

WM. KESSINGER,

Lieutenant, Commanding Post.

FAYETTEVILLE, May 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

I have information that Brown intends to attack the next train coming this way. There is one now en route. I advise that it be escorted by at least 150 men. He can undoubtedly raise 300 men. Captain King has just returned from a scout from toward Brown's Mill, and reports the signs as very thick.

M. LA RUE HARRISON,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., May 8, 1864.

Colonel PHELPS,

Commanding in the Field, south of White River, via Cassville:

If your stock cannot be subsisted where you are move back to or toward Forsyth and Cassville to a place where you can find grazing land, and I will send you some forage. A train of subsistence stores is on the way to you by Melville. Take charge of this. If Major Murphy is sick or dead at Yellville, bring him out. The crisis on the border has passed. The rebels have gone south. There is good grazing on White River, between Dubuque and Forsyth. If any
