Making public officers depositories—Mr. ¡Smith,
9.5ih CoNG....lst Sess.
ganize a great moneyed machine like this, and put
it, for all future lime, in the hands of the Execu-
tive , if they are willing, in the form ol a fiscal
agency, to create a Treasury bank, w ith its ramifica-
tio s penetrating every pait of the Union, 10 be
managed, directed, and controlled exclusively by
Executive agents. To my mmd it presents a fear-
ful conjunction—realizing that union between the
moneyed and political power ol the country, which
reflecting men have hitherto considered the most
fatal of all devices to the liberties of the people
I have revolved the subject deeply and anxiously,
and I can see but two possible issues to the scheme
proposed. It will either terminate m a great Trea-
sury bank, such as I have descubed, affording a
fatal accommodation to the moneyed concerns of
the countiy at the t xpense of it  liberties, or other-
wise, failing, in anv degree, to relieve the actual
derangement of the currency—on the contrary,
abandoning th it currency to wild disorder and con-
tusion—the people, finding the inconveniences of
i.uch a state of things no longer tolerable, will,
with a voice extorted by their sufferings call for a
national regulator in the shape of an meorpoiated
national bank ' Either alternative is, to my mind,
fearful and alarming, bnt believing one or the
other to be the destined result of the scheme pro-
posed, I entreat gentlemen to pause and consider
well the consequences of then decision
I recvu now, Mi President, to the question mote
particularly involved in the bill I ask leave to in-
troduce. I think I have shown, sir, that the exac-
tion of the public dues m gold and silvei, while the
great mass ol the circulation shall consist oí bank
paper, would be oppressive m practice—that it is
anti-republican in principle, as drawing an invidi-
ous line of demarcation between the Government
and people—and, especially, that in the piesent
circumstances of the country, it would indefinitely
retard, if not render impossible, that res imption ol
specie payments by the banks, which is the gieat
and urgent object of the public solicitude In con-
sidering the propositions w hich the occasion has
brought forth, I have been siiongly reminded of
the words of a great man—of one born to serve
and instruct mankind. Speaking of the province
and duties of a practical statesman, that great
oracle oí political wisdom says "A statesman
differs from a piofessor in a university. The lattei
has only the general view of society , the formei
(the statesman) has a number of ct>cumslanccs to
combino with those general ideas, and to take into
consideration Circumstances ate infinite, and in
finite!} combined, vanable, and trinsient, and he
vho does not like ihem into cms deration is not
erroneous, but mid, metaphysically mad A states-
man, ncvei losing sight oi prineiples, is to be guid-
ed by < irenmstances , and, judging rontiary to the
exigencies of lite moment, may mm his countiy jor-
ever " I ask, sir, is this the moment, when the
country is weak and suffering, to subject it to the
action of so violent a remtdy (if remedy it can be
called) as that involved in thepioposition to collect
the revenues in gold and silver t Does it show a
wise regaid to circumstances, at such a moment,
when that credit system, under which the country
has grown up to power and greatness, and with
winch, Jor the present, at least, its most vital mte-
jesis aie identified—at a moment when that credit
system, thus incorporated w uh the country, has ai-
read) sustained one ot the severest shocks to which
it has ever been exposed—is it wise and prudent I
say, to tniioduce an innovation in the fiscal pobcv
of the Government, which aims a fair! blow at
that system, and all the wide-spread and diversified
interests connected with it' Theeffcclof ttnsmrc-
vation,atthe¡)tesent moment, must be, as Ihave ¡j_
íeady shown, to fix upon the countrv, ft. r an indefinite
period of time, the cjisc of an irredeemab'eana de-
preciating paper currency, crotheivvise tofmee, vio-
lently and premature!}, in exclusive metallic c 1-
culation, by compelling the banks at on e to wind
lip their concerns IJut whit would be the conse-
quence of thus compelling the biuics pieoipilately
to wind ap their affairs'! Tl ev have vastly more
debts due to them than the) owe Compel them,
then, to wind up, and you turn them loose, oi ra-
ther drive them, in necssary selt-defence, apon the
community    According to the most recent and
authentic statements upon the subject, the aggre-
gate amount of debts due to the banks is between
four and five hundred millions of dollars Force
them, by ycur policy, to collect tfeis vast sum from
ihe community, and what a wide-spread scene of
desolation, embracing every class of the community,
must ensue' The banks will press upon the im-
porting merchant, the importing merchant upon the
retail dealer, and the latter upon his customers—
the laborer, the mechanic, and the farmei If the
rtsult of this desolating process should rot be, in
the language of Burke, " the rum of the country
forever," it would be, at least, to inflict upon it,
eauselessly and heedlessly, a blow, from which íe-
covery could be effected onl) through long ) ears
of suffering and distress
I stand here, Mr President, as no advocate of
the banking sjS(eni I have been the constant
enemy of its abuses, the correction of which, by
salutary and progressive reforms, I have steadily
pursued, without aiming, however, at the destruc-
tion of the s)stem itself, which the countiy has
chosen to adopt, and under which it has hitherto
attained a prospenty unparalleled in any age or
quarter of the woild The measuie I non offer to
the consideration of the Senate is, m my humble
judgment, one of the most effective reform I
have no interest w hatever m banks I do not own,
never have owned, and never expect to own, a sin-
gle shaie of stock in my bank, nor do I owe a debt,
ev en ot the smallest amount, to a bank I mention
these things, not because I could suppose thai other
gentlemen who might happen to be differently situ-
ated, could, in the slightest degree, be influenced by
considerations of this sort I deem too highly of the
patriotism of my fellow-citizens not to believe
them above all personal considerations, as I am
sure all with whom I have the honoi to be asso-
ciated on this floor are, in pronouncing on gieat
public questions, involving the interests of the
countiy I know how evei, th it lime aie ungener-
ous minds, which impute other principles of
action to publio men , and, following the example
of the Senator from South Carolina, who spoke
yesterday, (Mr Calhoun,) I have thought it not
improper to state what, from the nature of my
pursuits, happens to be my situation m this respect
Those pursuits identify me by interest, as my feel-
ings and tastes do by sympathy, with the gieat agu-
cultural body of the country I am under no bias to
regard the inteiestsoi othei pursuits or other classes
of the community, except aí I believe that, under our
happv institution , all pu m¿us and all classes ate
b'«|fi led in one common inicies!, and must prosper

the whole country an 1 all its interests that we
shall, I trust, dischaige our dune  here The occa-
sion mes farabove the narrow and fleeting interests
of partv, and demands the best exertions of all for
the country The measure which I have ventured
to offer is one on which I have supposed all parties
might unite, as all parties have heretofoie united
Its effect, I persuade myself, will be both to
revue confidence and to furnish security, and,
with the language of encouragement and with the
pledges of a wis- and stable policy, proceeding

BPEFCÍI OF MR. SMITH,
Or Indiana.
In Senate, September 21,   1837—The bill  "impo
s ng < dditional duties, as depositories in certain
cases,  on  public   officers,"  together   with  the
amendment offered  thereto  bj   Ml    Caihock,
being under considention, Mi  Efntos having
a d Ins amendment on the table—
Mi   SMITH, of Indiana, b tng entitled to Ihe
fiooi, K) e and said   Suffer rae, Mr   President, to
make to tae Senate my  acknowledgments loi its
kindness in adjourning over last evening upon m>
motion   At that time I was too much indisposed to
proceed, and, in retuin foi the indulgence of the
Senate, I ean only piomise you that I will detain jt
no longei than may become necessarj to enable me
Senate.
to submit, m as bijef a manner as possible, some
thoughts on this important subject
Sir, in this m) first attempt to address this
august body, of winch I have but rpcently had the
honor to become a member, I am not nnappnzed of
the delicacy of my situalion, surrounded by old,
able, and experienced Senators, who have grown
gray m the service of the country, in this and the
other body—men to whom the People have justly
looked for the doctrines of constitutional liberty It
would almost seem presumptuous ¡n me to throw
myself into this debate, noi could I be persuaded
to do so, to then entire exclusion, unless under a
paramount sense of duty to my State The country,
however, will lose nothing from that source, as I
understand that the subject now before the Senate
is one which w ill undergo a full and ample discus-
sion on the pait of those distinguished Senators to
whom the country is looking for mfoimation as to
the best course to be pursued, not only on the part
of the Government, but on the part of the People,
and while it is to be hoped that most of tiem will
respond to the call of the Senator fiom South Caro-
lina, (Mr Calholn,) I am still disposed to ask
voui indulgence to the cxpitssion of my own opin-
ions on a subject on which the views of even such
men are so opposite and so various
Sir, this is a subject of great importance to the
interests of the country, and one lhat has caused
great anxiety in the public mind It is therefore
highly important that the'whole mattci should be
laid clearly and fully befoi ■• the People, that they
may have an opportunity of judging foi themselves
on the merits of the pioposilions made here, both
in favor of and against the views of the Executive
For mv own part, it is sufficient for me to say t lat,
if I know mv own heart, I came to this body with
a smceie desire to co-opente with the Executive
Government in am measures which may benefit
the People, or lesloie the national prosperity , and
tow aids the mdivilnil now in Ihe Executive chair,
and the other officeis ot the Government, I have
none other than the kindest feelings But in rela-
tion to measures pioposed for the benefit of the
People, I hold myself at liberty to examine them
fully and freely, without being controlled by those
trammels which have been too often used to force
men to act contrary to their convictions. When I
took my seat in this body, it was with a full deter-
mination to examine carefully foi m) self the vari-
ous propositions that might be presented, and to de-
cide upon them according to their merits Sir, we
were called on to aid the Government, because it
is obs-tiucted m the exercise cf its oi linaiy powers
<Ynd when we were told (hit ¡he Got eminent re-
quired oui aid, that it was emb urassedfor the want
of moncv, and thptitvvis necessary foi Congress
to grant it supplies to aid in the couise ot its oidi-
nary opeiations, I did not hesitate, noi did I even
examine vei) closel) the propositions m lehtionto
the means of those supplies, bul, knowing lhat
ihev came from the Con mittee on Finance, founded
on the estimates of the Secretar) of the Treasury,
without any hesitation I vote! foi the bill authoriz-
ing the issue of Tre *ury notes I pieferredthe bill
as it was, wnhout striking out the provision foi
interest on tt-e notes I vías not willing to íesort to
a temporary expedient, such is issuing notes with-
out mtere t, which,as heretofoie, could serve only
to de ude the People, and end m disappointment
wit! out iny prictieil benefit
The next bill in ordei vv< s the one to postpone
the fon th instalment of the deposites with lie States
It may not be «Irictly in order, b it, as great lat t tele
has neen given to the debate, I beg leave here to
giv e ni) íeasons why I could not v ote foi tl at bill,
and one of the strongest, in m) m nd, was this, that
the Government of the United S'nes, t' rough the
medium of an act of Congrpss, had raised expecta-
tions, on the part of the States, winch it ought not
to disappoint. The States had prepared to receive
the moncv , they accepted the pr position of the
Government, piocceded to legislat" on the subject,
and many orthe S ales approprnted the whole fund
some to the important cause of education, some to
aid in their works of m'ernal improvement, some
m one way ?nd some in another, beneficial to the
People The St es rel ed with full confidence on
the receipt o. the money , they had a right so to re,
