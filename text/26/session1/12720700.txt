to 7 per cent, discount. Do not these  facts speak
volumes? Sir, I have nothing to do with our local
banks, nor do I own one dollar of their stocks; but
yet those wh  art interested in them are my consti-
tuents, and the interest I feel in their prosperity
will ever restrain me from voting to recharter a
corporation, the past history of which presents one
continued series of oppression and injury to the
people I represent. I have been charged with a
desire to destroy all banks; the charge is false and.
calumnious. I would reform the abuses which
have crept into them. But, relieved ot their im-
perfections, and administered with a view to the
welfare and convenience of the community, I
would stand by them and defend them from the
insidious attacks of pretended friends, who, with
the banks, ever on their lips, are willing to re-
instate a great overshadowing national institu-
tion, which, in the language of the Legislature
of Georgia, "has not only taken from the State
her medium of circulation for her valuable
products, but by frequent and repeated demands for
large sums in specie upon the State banks, had well
nigh drained their vaults, thereby threatening their
destruction, and compelling them, in order to meet
the exigency, to curtail their discounts, insomuch
as to deprive the State and the individual stock-
holders of their usual and expected dividends "'
It is said, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Van Buren
bad depressed the wages of labor and the price of
property—that the results of his administration are
seen and felt in the ruin and distress which sur-
rounds us. This charge is easily made; but where
are the proofs? Round assertion may astonish, but
cannot convince us. What is the cause of this uni-
veisal distress, which is said to pervade the whole
country? Their answer is, the people are in debt,
and cannot get money to satisfy their creditors.
Admit it to be true—who is to blame for it, Mr.
Van Buren, or the bank^ Why, sir, if cur dis-
tresses, as we are told, aris? from a scarcity of mo-
ney, iht contraction of the currency is evidently the
cause of that effect. The banks, and not Mr. Van
Buren, make the currency. They contract or ex-
pand it as their pleasure or interest dictates, and I
now propose to prove to you, by irrefutable refe-
rences, that the banks, who alone furnish the me-
dium of purchases, have not only contracted their
issues to a fearful and ruinous extent, but that the
price of flour, one of the main articles of sub-
sistence, fell in exact proportion to the contraction
of the currency.    Here, sir, is a
Table  fexpansions and contractions of the Ohio banks for
eleven months fiom 30th April, 1839, to 3lst March, 1840,

I have selected this table from a number of others
within my reach, simply because the distress, of
which we hear so much, is said to be mos'lypreva-
lent in the West. Thus you see, sir, when the
banks contracted, the price of flour fell; and when,
in February, 1840, a slight expansion to^k place,
the price of flour rose cor.espondent'y !
Let us look further into the state of things in
Ohio, a great and central State, exercising an im-
portant influence in the fiscal affairs of the West. I
read from the " Ohio Eagle:"
"PAMC, PRESSURE, LOW PRICES, AND THE CAUSE.
"No one fact is better established than that the' pernicious
fluctuations' (as honest John Davis says) of our paper money
system, exercise a controlling power over the business and va-
lues of the country. In the day oí'expansion' when money
is made plenty by the banks, property, produce, and labor, are
high—the to-morrow ef ' contraction' comes, money is made
scarce, and all prices of property and rewards of labor are
knocked down with the crash.
"Apply this general and acknowledged rule to the condition
of things is Ohio. The whole Union is suffering Hie evils of
money contraction ; but let us look at our own Std'e for an
illustration of the means by which it is brought about We
take the reports of the officers of the banks themselves, made
under sath, to the Bank Commissioners, and by them compiled
-Their first annual report to the Legislature, shows the circula-
tion of the Ohio banks on the 30ih day of April, 1839, to have

Contraction of circulation within one year
«4,117,546 80
i " Thus, within one year, one-half of the circulating medium
of the StdteotOhio has been violently withdrawn by the banks.
" Why has this contraction, and the sufferings which are the
necessary consequence, been brought upon the country f The
Federal apologists and allies of the banks will say, because the
Bank Commissioner law compelled them to curtail. But let
us take five of these institutions, at the principal points of Cm
cmnati, Dayton, Columbus, Chilhcothe, and St Clairsville,
thus.

Eight hundred and thirty-two thousand four hundí ed and
fifty three dollars is the extent to which five banks, at principal
commercial points, have applied the screws. Now as to the
necessity of this curtailment, look at the following comparative
statement of circulation and speci  or. the 30th of April last

"One hundred and forty-seven thousand six hundred and
seventy eight dollars and seventy cents is the amount of spe
cie which these five banks have locked up in their vaults, lying
idle, unproductive, and useless, while the whole community is
suffering around them. Take this amount, and multiply it by
three—their ratio of paper to specie, and we find that it would
sustain a circulation of $443,096 10—that is, the surplus specie
would sustain a greater amount of circulation by nearly one
hundred thousand dollars, than the five banks in question have
out, ana the five banks then have less out by «504 551 46 than
would be allowed by the bank commissioner law, about which so
much complaint is made
"Fellow-citizens, here is a reason for the lowness of prices,
and stagnation of business that oppress the community. Five
banks, taken as instances from among the thirty-seven, and
taken because they are located St important points ofbusiness,
have convulsed-the business community around them with a
contraction Of«832,453 in one year. They have seized the spe-
cie of the country, and locked it up in their vaults, giving to the
suffering and complaining people that surround them less of
their paper by near one hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
than they have taken from them in hard money This warfare
and outrage upon the public good is defended by the Federal
presses upon the pretence that the bank commissioner law ren-
dered it necessary. That law fixes the safe and proper ratio of
three to one, and would allow these five banks to issue «1,511,-
471 upon the specie which they now have in their vaults With-
out necessity, without pretext or excuse, without a feeling of
sympathy or compassion for the sufferings they have created,
these banks have taken away, and withhold from the people,
«l,155,246of circulation, which their specie would sustain, and
which the law would allow them to issue."
Here, sir, is a specimen of the way in which mo-
ney is made scarce. These aie facts and deduc-
tions which every man can understand; and yet
Mr. Van Buren, who controls no bank, and who
has as yet no Sub-Treasury, is accused of lowering
prices and ruining the people! I will not detain
you by reading the numerous statistics I have col-
lected in relation to the causé of low price?; but as
I have already consumed more of your time lhan I
intended, I will pass on to a conclusion as swiftly
as practicable.
The bill on your table is about to become a law:
instead of increasing the distresses of the country,
its beneficial effects are already beginning to be
felt. Heretofore, during this winter, gold and sil-
ver have been selling in this city at from four to
five and sit per cent, premium; it now can scarce-
ly be sold on Pennsylvania avenue for three per
cent. Is ih s no gain to the people? Instead of
locking Bp the specie in yoursafes, it will draw out
a portion of it to be circulated among the creditois
of the Government. Who are the)? Not only
the officers who administer the Government, bat
the workirgmen who furnish the supplies of cloth-
ing and subsistence to }our array and navy;
the soldiers and sailors who fight jour battle^;
the laborers who construct your pubic build-
ing*; who build your fortifications and vessels
of war. Every man who sells . to the Govern
ment either his peronal services, or the produce
of his labor will be paid in gold and siver;
i and this gold and silver will return, in due time, to
the TreauT-y again, to be expended among the
creditors o the Government. The amount ot spe-
cie required for the Treasury will be, by being
thus kept in constant circulation, not more than five
millions ot the seventy or eighty milluns cf dollars
now in the United States. But I am told we are
making one currency for the Government, and an-
other tor the people. If this were true, I myself
would condemn the measure. The bill makes no
provision for the currency of the people; it only
pi escribes the currency which the Government will
receive for deb's due to it; and which, when re-
ceived, it pays oat again to the people, leaving them
free to receive what they please in payment of the
debt-, due to them. An J if this be a better cuiren-
cy, do not the men who, I have shown you, ulti-
mately receive it, eventually reap the benefit?
Shall the public Treasurer be compelled to receive
any thing and every thing that the peop'e choose to
receive from each other? If so, we must take
bonds, due bill*, promissory notes of all sorts, and
the irredeemable paper money which is afloat in
the country, nay, sir. you must receive \our taxes
and duties in kind, because you know all these are
current among the people; and what is good for the
people, say ihey, is good for the Government. Let
us tet>t this objection to the Sub-Treasury system,
by a glancs at the itale of things as they actually
exist in the South. I cut from the "Da'ly Tele-
graph," published in Savannah, the following ad-
vertisements, which will serve to show what sort of
curr.ency the people think proper to receive from
each «ther:
"TO THE PUBLIX
"The subscriber begs of his friends, and of those who hold
any of the few shinplasters that he has signed, to send them to
his store, where he will pay bankable money for them. On
putting those bills out, lu thought that it would afford immedi
ate relief, in the way of change, to himself and friends Find
ing, however, that it has not this effect, he declines signing any
more, but will take, for goods, Mr. Wiltberger's, the City
Council's, and Ice House Company of Augusta, Macon, Co-
lumbus, Brunswick, Danen, or any other individual shinplas-
ters in our city.                  .                   "P HALLIGAN "
"ALL KINDis OF MONEY.
"The subscriber will takp Wiltberger'a, Demp ey's, Lloyd's,
Rogers'Sj Halligan's, City Council bills, and those of all respon-
sible individuals, whenever offered him for goods
"M. PENDERGAST."
The above are practical illustrat ons, drawn from
actual life, of the Whig theory, that whatever
currency the people think proper to receive, this
Government is also bound to receive. How long
could we maintain our stand among the natttons of
the earth, if your Treasurer was compelled to take
"all kinds of money"—"Mr. Wiitbeiger's, the Ci'y
Council's, and Ice-house Companies' bills, or any
other individual's shinplasters in our city?" Your
army would be dispersed, your navy would ro*,
your forts, arsenals, and public buildings, would
be left without a tenant, to decay and ruin; your
public officers would seek support elsewhere, and
this happy state of affairs, produced by this Whig
theory, would bring about precisely that "critical
mement" predicted by Mr. Jefletson, "when a se-
ries of untoward events, sufficient to bring into
doubt the competency of a Republican Govern-
ment," would transpire, and which a National
Bank might take advantage of, to step in and "up-
set the Government."
The Bank r,arly,so eagerto take the public mo-
ney into their own keeping, now attempt to frighten
us with the declaration, that this bill will place the
whole revenue in the hands of Mr. Van Buren.
Let the bill on your table, and the Constitution, an-
swer this futile and interested objection. Instead
of placing the revenue in the hands of
the President, it places it in the United States
Treasuiy—the people's strong box—where it
ought to be, and where it cannot be loaned out or
banked upon for the benefit ef speculators and
bank favorites. The Constitution provides that
no money shall be drawn out cf the Trea-
sury except in pursuance of appropriations
made by law; and any officer of the Government
who ihall violate these restrictions, or embezzle a
dollar, "or who shall convert to his own use, in
any way whatever, or shall use by way if invest-
ment in any kind of propet ty or merchandise, or
shall loan, with or without interest, any portion of
the public moneys intrusted to him for safekeeping,
disbursement, transfer, or for any other purpose,
every such act shall be deemed and adjudged to be
an embezzlement of so much of the said moneys
