E. D. TOWNSEND,Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, New Orleans, June 6, 1864.*

Brigadier General ROBERT ALLEN,

Supervising Quartermaster, Louisville, Ky.:

GENERAL: The transportation for 25,000 troops [cavalry and artillery, in their usual proportion] will be required in this division. About two-thirds of this can be secured at Memphis and at points below; the remainder, say, for 8,000 men, must be sent from above. There is the same necessity for keeping this on hand and constantly available that there is for keeping land transportation on hand. Movements cannot be regulated by the timme it takes to collect transportation on the river above and have it sent down. For general purposes of transportation the boats in the river trade are included in the general estimate. I will need in six days transportation for 5,000 men, and I have sent Captain Klinck to Memphis to select it from the boats now there.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
