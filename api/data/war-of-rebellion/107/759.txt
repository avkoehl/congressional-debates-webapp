Can you not send me a first-rate regiment to take its place in the fort on Federal Hill? It is an important position for the defense of Baltimore. The term of service of the Seventh Regiment expires on the 25th. The colonel consents to remain until the 28th at my request. Please answer.

FALMOUTH, August 25, 1862.

Major General F. J. PORTER:

Until Sumner's troops arrive it would be well to hold the fords with an ample force. You are now in connection with Pope, and, no doubt, can get what cavalry you want. When you can dispense with the three companies of Indiana cavalry, please send them back. We will send up the forty wagons with provisions for Morell and griffin; have sent down to Aquia for wagonload of hospital stores; will send them with supply train if they arrive. The wagons and ambulances will be sent out as they arrive with the direction you request. All quiet here. Your dispatches all received, and your disposition of troops is all right. You state that Reno is expected to pass to your left. To what point is he to go?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
