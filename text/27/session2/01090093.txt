Smith ] He would be pleased if the chairman would turn his
attention to the subject, and ask for the printing of that repoit
If not, he would himself make the motion

sideration of the bill for the relief of Margaret llames the

This bill had been reported hom the Committee on Pensions
with an amendment allowing 820 uVeau of $i0 pci yutiasa
pension
Mi Pierce explained the bi 1 He slid n hid be^n or gi
nally reported for one year's service, bus the ommittee had
thought proper to allow only for the service which was proved
by record evidence in the Department, which was a few days
}eas than six months The bill was then reported to the Senate,

1841
Mr Calhoun moved its reference to the Committee on Com
merce, but after borne conversation between Mr Calhoun
and Mr King, as to the propriety of such reference, and the
policy of granting the relief, inasmuch as it would be the
means of instigating thousands of other cases—
Mr HUNTINGTON remarked that a similar petition, pre
sented by the gentleman from South Carolina, and lefei red to
the Committee on Commerce, had been reported baek to the be
nate, and referred to the Committee on Finance, as a moie ap
propnate committee

the services of her militia                      ?
Mr P also asked that the same committee be discharged
from the furthei consideration of the memorial of Monsieur
Gonon in relation to a system of telegraphing
Mr P ¡said the system was supposed to be very useful m
time of war, but the committee did not deem it necessary m
time of peace The construction was not vei y difficult, an 1
could easily be resorted to when íequired The primary diffi-
culty was to designate any particulai point It did nnt occut
to the committee that New York, n. the event of war, would
be more important than New Orleans At all events it was not
nec^ssaiy at this paiticuiartime and hence the committee had
asked to be discharged from its further consideration
Mr MOUTON said the object was understoo 1 to be one of
very great importance to the Government Tic memorial
asked simply that in expeument night be made tn test fully us
efficacy, so that in time of war it might be applied, and did not
ask to fix any particular point Monsieur Gonon did not ami
Cipate any great extension of the system at pieseut
Mr PRESTON spoke of the system as highly creditable to
the ingenuity and talents of thQ inventor Mr P did not pre
tend to any knowledge of the science oí telegtaphm<i, he had,
however, se^scveral in his life an 1 it was hut justice to Mon
sieur GonoJB say that his system was incomparably superior
to them all The committee thought, however, that even an
experiment between heie and New York would involve an ex
pense that Congress, under present circumstances, would not
be likely to undergo, and that had operated to induce the íeport
Which had just been made.
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr MOUTON said he would prefer that the report lie on
the table for the present, which was acceded to by Mi Pitas
TON
Thebill for the relief of John McLeod was then taken up as
in committee of the whole, and, without consideration, was, on
the motion of Mr PRENTISS, ordered to lie on the table
The bill to increase the salary of officers in the revenue cut-
tei service, whilst serving m the Navy of the United States, was
taken up as m committee of the whole, and, after an explana
tion of the provisions ofthe bib by Mr HUNTINGTON, who
showed the propriety and justice of passing it, though it was
prospective and retrospective in its operation-
Mr PIERCE obtained the floor, and thought it better to let the
matter lie o ver a few days, until the resolution of the Senator from
Delaware was acted on, propo ing to abolish the revenue cutter
service, and to employ the navy He was, however, opposed
to the retiospective operation of the bill which goes back to
1836, on the ground that it would be liable to abuse, and would
be setting a dangeious example for future legislation
The bill wa' passed by foi the present
The resolution submitted yesterday by Mr Linn, m relation
to the possess on of the Oregon Territory, was tak^n up, when
Mr LINN said tnat if the resolution was then considere i, it
might lead to a discussion which would delay another subject

The motion of reference of the report of the Secretary of the

Mr MOREHEAD did not nsejwith an# view of going into
an elaborate atgument on the question immediately under the
consideration of the Senate, the mam tíbints involved in that

Inkrthe eci^ urns an e it seemed to mm ihit the pioposi

occasion waspiessmg,for, whateverdifferenceof opinion might
be entertained as to the cau&e of the distress and embarrassment
of the country, there could be none as to the fact of their exist
ence, and that they called aloud foi relief The people of this
couutiy, it cannot be denied are laboring under great and un
mitigated difficulties Commeice is deranged—every source of
industry is paralyzed—the currency is unsound and exchanges
etoibitant There may be differences oi opinion as to the
ciusc of all thi=!, but there can be none, he would lepeat, as to
thepxistem-eof the facts Surely oppressions so severe seem
ed to cab mesisubly on the legislators of the country for relief
He wa< awaie that differences of opinion prevailed during the
extra session, on the question whether at the late Presidential
election, the people had decided for a Bank of the United States,
oi whether that q jes tion was involved m the Presidential elec
tion at all It wis, also, a matter of dispute then whether the
present Chief Magis rite wjs or was not, pledged by the deci
sion of that election to a National Bank
He did not propose to open up that question now It would
not be contioverted that the people expected Congress would
oieate some national institution either of the na ure of an old
fashioned Bank of the United States or something compatible
with the principles of the Whig party, to restoie a sound cur
rency, and to relieve the e>¥ihairassments of the country
Whatever may have happened in other sections of the country,
he could say with confidence that the Wesx for yeets hat, bpen
laboring under all the disadv mtages of a depreciated cune cv
For yean had the industry an! en er prise of the West been

great West, now filled up as it was with a hardy, vigorousL,
and industrious population, had to pay thas enormous tay,
drawn from them for the exchanges, and ail, as he contended,
attributable to a deranged currency The people beheved that
a national currency was to be had by a National Bank; such
an institution they thought would remedy all these anís.
Could it, theiefore, be matter of wonder, that the people oC
the West looked with great interest and solicitude to the extra
session, when they saw their Senators and Representatives
straining every nerve, and making every sacrifice, to obtain re-
lief—and that they should now regard with sorrow the unsuc-
cessful exertions which had been made to obtain an institution
suited to their desires^ The people of the West had contribu-
ted to their utmost in suppoit of that distinguished individual
now at the head of the Government They had rushed like the
mountain flood to his support Kentucky had given him and
his illustrious associate a gi eatei vote than ever befcre, and that,
too in opposition to the pretensions of oneof her own respected
and favorite sons They had confidence in the President of the
United States They knew that he wasa Whig, the nominee of
a Whig National Convention, and, aboveall, that he wasa Virgi
man Kentucky had no doubt of him, and if she ever had, those
doubts were dispelled by the inaugural letterofthe President of
the United states to the American people He would not stop
here to comment upon those disappointments at ihe extrases-
810H, which however great, did not so disheaiten the Whigs as
to prevent them from looking to another session of Congress, m
the hope that some measure of relief would be proposed But
they had been disappointed, and it was a sad spectacle, after a
twelve years' sti uggle, to see that party suddenly overcome and
prostrated, as it was It was not, therefore, by any means sdr-
pnsmg i hat the fall elections gave our good Democratic
friendsatempoiary triumph With what heart could theiroppo-
nents come to the contest under the appalling prospects around
them? They did nerertheless, look to the present session of Con-
giess for relief, but they were not prepared to leap to any mea-
sure which might be proposed They wereready to unite toac
comphsh whatevei measure could he accomplished consistent
with then formei punciples If they had done or could do
this, they would have been justly liable to the imputation
of the grossM--t mionsistency, and would have deserved a lobaof
confidence But the senate now had the piomised scheme of
the Piesident before it, and there weie objections,m his humble
judgment at the very outset, without looking at the details of
the meaoiirt. It was manifest upon its face that it had proceed
ediiom the Executive, and it was obviously the tendency of
tne measure to be contioiled by the Executive The contestof
1840 was to bieak down alt barneis which might intervene be-
tween ihe Governmentand the people, but the ¡secretary of the
Treasury, though properly the officer of Congress and the peo-
ple wis heie obviously the officer of the President He (Mr.
Morehead) objected to this report then beca us" it comes from
the Lxeeutive end comes from him instead of the agent of the
people and the Government—the luasurer of the United
totales as his own measure
Ihe pioject now laidbefoieCongress, he considered nothing
but a Government institution—a Government Bank, whether
called by ih u i)3me*0''not No matter whether it wasto be
called in Exchequer, an Exchange Institution, or a Govern-
ment Baik, it was the child of the Government, supplied with
imdsbythe Government managed by Government officers,
din' exclusively under the control of the Government And
this was not the first time that such a scheme had been
offered u> Congiess and íejected A distinguished Presi-
dent of the Un ted | States had shadowed forth upon two
occasions such a scheme as this to the Congress of the United
States, and it was leferred in the two Houses to appropriate
committees At the head of the committee in the ¡senate was
GeutJial Samuel 'smith of Maryland, and át ihe head of the com
mittee of ihe other House, Mr McDuffie of South Carolina
These gentlemen regarded the pioposed plan then as a great
Govemmentinstitutio i The report of Mr McDuffie was par-
ticularly distinguished foi the views of the committee If this
was not a Government bank, it wasa Government institution,
ar d the foundation ol which was for the lbstie of a Government

enoimousmcieaseof Government patronage which it creates
