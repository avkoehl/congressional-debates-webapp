Lieutenant Colonel JOHN N. HERDER,

Commanding Post, Pilot Knob:

If the other two companies have not been sent to Captain Leeper, let them go forward at once. Keep in communication with him, and have the cavalry of your command ready to move, if necessary. The report seems sensational, but we must be on hand for what comes. General Fisk will not return before Tuesday next.
