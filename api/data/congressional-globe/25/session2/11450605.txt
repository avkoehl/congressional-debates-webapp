This ii *1 c grc i' secret of our supenonty, and of that of eve^y
free pojp'e rut the loi mí of a coiSMution, not the outlines of
a =*rs (.n, not meie organization, but the principle of hfe, the
allpe vailing animation and vitality that informs ih whole
body politic, and gives n the wan)ith, and stiensih.and activity,
the winning graces an J expres&n e countenance of a nan, m
s eadoflhe cold and lepulstve stillness of a pimted corpse
Jury trial is another oí these irregularities—liab'e, undoubted
ly, to much cntici-ra m deiai) and scarcely susieptiblc, as a
jundicil institution, of a strict defence m theory—\et what
should we lunk of arefomier that should propose to us the
abortion of asystemso full of piactical good, because it was
unknown until recently anywhe.e but in England, and ulten
leads, as it certainly has oiten led, to gj eat abuse and injusi ire?
But, then, it seems our banking system is an innovation, in
irolucedonly a century and a hall ago, and deviates liom the
primitive model of the Bank of Amsieidam the honest <=ve
tern, as it is called—and that, instead of lending money, Itlemls
merely credit
[Mr I> here went at some length into an argument to show
the futility of the suggestion oí the banking system being an
innovation, showing that it is one ol those innovations which
had their origin at that great epoch of human improvement,
■when mankind ceased to cut i^ch other s throats for differ
enees in leligion, and began to make wai for colonies and com
meree &c ]
With a population, then, increasing at the rate of four to five
percent ayear, and with an actumulau in of capital and pro
durtive power propouionably greater,I hold it to be utterly ah
suid'o talk of anything hkeametalhc currency m the United
States 'lhere is no possible means of procuring u, and, if by
any means it could be procured, I venture to affirm that out
people wou1d tr^t rid ol n in ihe < oui&e of afew years, though
all the putal laws of bpaiu against the cxpoitation of gold and
silver hhonld be re enacted hei —laws which weie passed with
no other effect, pvt-n in that country, hut to show the utterfuti
luy of such legislation I say, su, that, with then present habits
of active cnterprlee and strict economy, th*" American people
would expoit the precious mauls asfa*t a they were imported,
beyond any amount of them which mHu be absolutely neces
fcaty for the domestic exchanges ot the country, and they
would doso, because gold and suver would be of mole use
abroad in purchasing commodities, and would bi whollv su
perfluous at home, where paperwould do < s well Xfvouput
down Athebanks," it Vvouldhavt no eflectbutto spj up sunt
thing worse in their place, in the shape of private paper
Theieaie some things over which fie mo«t def-potic Hwsiveis
are unable to exercise any control, and one of them, as ilex
p^rience shows is this commercem bullies*.
Sn, it has been said that the only advantage of a papur cm
rency consists in its cheapness 1 am, by no means, as yon
may gather horn what I have said, ready to admit this, but,
supposing it to be true, is that saving really an unimportant
matter? Mr Gallatin, In a pamphlet of smgulai abi yi has,
as 1 conceive, fallen mtoa grive error on this subject, which it
is so much the more important to lectify, as 1 perceive that he
has misled others more disposed than lumsell to turn a spertila
tlve error into a practical rr i^chief He states the whole bene
fit derived from the use of paper, instead of the precious metals,
in the United Stales in 1830, including, under the name of cu
culatlon, private depositesm the banks, as they oughtundoubt
idly tot , at aboui five millions of d illais a >ear It is Hue,
tint, aran ding to print iples admitted by Mr Gallatin, the pi o
gress of the country, both in wealth and population in the last
sevenyeats would rcqulit, a very coosideiable addition to be
made to ihts estimate, in oiderto a conectapphcition of it to
our actual condition Bui, sir, ¡t appears to me that the est!
mate was made on data altogether eirone-ous In the first place,
the quantity of currency, if it were metal lc. necessary to the
encitlation ofihis country, was prodigiously undernted For
reasons that need not be stated here, it ¡s found thai t given
amount of metallic cunency does not circulate as rapidly as
an equal amount of paper, and, theieforc, that more of it is,
celen*paribus, lequited to do the same business But vvi h
out going into such minute inquiry here, why should the United
¿tales, with sixteen millions of inhabitants ai d re atively the
most active trade, both foieign and domestic, in the world and
withextraorchnaiy productive powei ot all sor s, not need at
the lety least half the cucultiinn nire^aiv in Fiance, with
onlj double their population, and not half their industry  The
stress that ought to be Hid on this lattoi mrumsiarce may be
lllus rated by comparing Asia with Europe in this particular
doubethf population in the foimei, possessing, according to
the mos acemve ieBearcnc-, only one fifth the quantity of
