But if the accused shall not be so entitled, the justice or judge
shall remand him
Another provision is that from any decision of such justice
or judge, an appeal may be taken to the circuit court of the Uni-
ted elates lor the district in which theca^e is heard, and from
the judgment of that court, to the Supreme Com t ofthe United
States, pending which proceedings or appeal, and until
and after final judgment rendered, or oi d^chaige, any
proceedings against the accused m any State court, or by au
thorny of any state, for any matter or thing so heard and de
termiifed, or in process under the writ of habeas co?pws, shad
be deemed null and void Mr Berrien having thus explained
the provisions of the bill, proceeded to show the necessity which
experience had proved to exist, of extending to the Federal ju
risdiction the right of issuing and acting upon the habeas corpus
writ m tho«e casos enumerated, to which that authority had not
before been extended When the motion should be made to
amend the bill as proposed by the senator from Massachusetts,
[Mr Choate] he should make no objection, though he had
considered the bill framed to embrace the principle, he should
therefore treat of the bill as if so amended
He could conceive of only 'hiteobjtctions to the bill Tint, to
the process, second, (o the mode of its application or issue, and
third, as to the constitutional propriety of the junsdiction as
sorted
To these three poms he would add e<=s himself for the
present, leaving all former argument to arise out ol such
discussion as might be made in the pi ogress of the bi I
With regard to the first, he contended that the high venera
tion and impoitance attached by our anc storb to the hub*as
corpus writ, had mduc*d them to bung it with them fjom the
mother country, and it was qjite in aicoi lai ce with ti e«pmt
with which it was ftamed and cherished, to extend its benefits
to foreigners, on the same punoiples of ju= ice that it wa~ in
tended should ¿ruaid the privileges of citizens The object wa=
to allow a foieigner prosecuted mone of i e States of the tnion
for an offence commit'ed in tl af S ate, but which he pleads has
been commuted undei authority of hit, own sovereignty, or the
authority oí the laws of niti ns, to be brought up on that issue
before the only competent judicial power to decide upon mat
ters involved infoieigi relations ot the law of nations The
plea, must show that it ha^ refeience to the laws or treaties of

He referred very briefly to the other pro* isiyns of the bill
