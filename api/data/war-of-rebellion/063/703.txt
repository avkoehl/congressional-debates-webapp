BROWNSVILLE, May 21, 1864.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR,

Little Rock:

The recall of shelby explains the contradictory reports we have had to-day. Shall make a long leg after him to-morrow. If you send me more cavalry, they can soon overtake me. With Ryan, Lovejoy, and what you send, I will go forward in person and hinder his retreat, if possible, and certainly, if I can, come up with him.

What a pity we are not at Austin to-night.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 21, 1864.

General J. R. WEST,

Brownsville:

More cavalry arriving at Devall's Bluff. I propose to send all that can be spared to you. Tow negroes from Camden report Kirby Smith gone to Shreveport, and taken nearly the whole force with him. They say that Shelby was ordered to Missouri, but that he has been recalled. Banks has advanced and driven Dick Taylor to Mansfield. We must move on Shelby and not let him get back.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BROWNSVILLE, May 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General CARR:

Shall meet or pursue Shelby with all possible speed. I expect Lovejoy is falling back on Little Rock by the upper Batesville road. Please send out and order him to join me as I get toward Clinton. If you can send him 1,000 rations hard bead, it will help him much. Geiger marches direct to Austin. I shall keep all my cavalry and pushon, leaving the infantry. Your suggestion that we are not certain that Shelby is to go back is well timed.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BROWNSVILLE, May 21, 1864.

Captain B. O. CARR,

Little Rock:

I have given no orders to your trains, except that the train which you detained at Devall's Bluff all last night should come forward. This I did, too, before I received your dispatch that you would give all ordes to trains, and that the one at Devall's Bluff was detained for some unaccountable reason. I have been detained now twenty-four hours, and expect still to be another day, by what I consider your mismanagement. I notified you last evening at 9 o'clock that the train detained at Devall's Bluff had my subsistence on it. Whenever it pleases you to let me have that subsistence I shall be ready to move. I do not know that I could then or now more fully communicate to you what I wanted.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
