of respect t/e can pay to the memory of one who
yet Jives m the cherished remembrances and aff c-

Sta'e of which he was a favorite child, and on
whom she r-sted high and proud hopes of future
usefulness and eminence. There is allotted to but

gids love die >ourg" was a tender delusion of
heathen uperstiUon, in this instance, he trusted,
but exemplified and adopted by a wise and myste-

Tne naledic ion, "May you die from home," was

Resolved, As a further testimony of respect for
the deceased, that when this House adjourn to-day,
it ?djourn to to morrow.
