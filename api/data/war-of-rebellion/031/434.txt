Brigadier General DANIEL BUTTERFIELD,

Commanding Fifth Corps.

No. 195. Report of Captain Alanson M. Randol, First U. S. Artillery, Chief of Artillery.

NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., December 19, 1862.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that, on the morning of the 11th instant, we left camp at 7 a.m., in company with the Third Division (General Humphreys') Fifth Army Corps, and halted near the camp of General Stoneman's corps, where we encamped for the night.

We left camp at an early hour the next morning, and proceeded with the division to a point near General Sumner's headquarters, in which vicinity we camped for the night.

We left camp the next day (the 13th) about 2 p.m., and followed the division across the Rappahannock to Fredericksburg. Immediately after crossing, I reported to General Humphreys for orders, and by him was directed to place my command in some sheltered place, and await further orders. As soon as this was done, I rode to the front to select a suitable position for my batteries, but found nearly all the available positions occupied by the batteries of General Sumner's grand division. When the division was moved to the support of General Couch's corps, I reported on the field to General Humphreys, and by him was directed to hold my command within supporting distance in case of a repulse of his division.

I immediately gave orders for the march of my batteries to the front, and, while this was in process of execution, I was directed by General Butterfield to report to Captain Weed, chief of artillery of the corps; but as I could not find him, and our troops were falling back in confusion,
