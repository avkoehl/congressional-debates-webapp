And -the question being un the amendment to the amend-
ment—
Mr ATHERTO'^ said he believed it must be aparent to every
«He that the great ques ion under consideration, was whethei an
attempt should be made to procurethis loan, without any suf
iictent and ample pledges at the time of making it, to secure the
¡repayment of it, oí wnetrei it shall besent loith without any
Buch pledge More especially was thisquesdon forced on their
' consideration since the message of the President of the United
States had been received a few days ago, audit was his puipose
to reply briefly to some suggestions which had been thrown out
m this debate concerning the subject of the public lands, the
proceeds of which the President has lecommended the House
to pledge u> seeuie the payment of this loan The gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mr Marshall,] who spoke days since, re-
ferred to the land fund as a lund derived irom cessions by cer
tarn States, aud he spoke of the impropriety of depriving the
¿States of the íesiJuum of that which they had conceded to the
Government
Several gentlemen who had spoken had spoken m the same
"way of the land being derived by the General Government fiom
cessions by the State  Now to untlerstanu the facts m regard
to this subject, it was necessary to advert very hriefJy to the
history of the public lands They weie of two classes, the
first were derive 1 by cess on of several of the old States, and th<*
next, were those to which have been acquired by the United
fetdtes since the adoption oi tlw Constitution, by treaty and pur
chase from fore ¿o Cover unents, and paid for out of the Na
tionai Treasury líe then went into the history of the public
* land?, and the en cumstanceo attendant on their acquisition, and
then went into an argument of some length against the distn
Tmtion of the public Ian is exam i meg the deeds of cesión of
the various State*, in which fee said theie could nothing be
Jound that reserved any right ovei the lands to the States, or
which, «Eld not imply that the proceeds of these lands were to
be used as a common find of the Treasury of ths United
¡States lie also examined the tenure of the lands acquired by
treaty and purchase, condemning distribution of the lands ac-
quired fiom eitnei of these sour es as tending to bring the
fetales to depend on the General Government, and to consoli
date all power in that Government, and advocating the íepeal
fif the di-stucution act

Mi riLI/IOllC i«<>iptetl it \ vy much He had tried

over him
Mr \TIIRRrON ^ ^ ow appeared on the face of this
bill that a^ amend men wi propn^el ro süike oat nve mil
lions fiorii this lom wiich wí*> t qua! to the amount of 1 rea
sury notes issued In the course of evensthe Secretary t r the
Treasury had comp forward and *iai Í he should need $5¡600,000
more, and the Committee of Ways and Means was to give
mm relief to that amount, and that, too, by the chairman with
drawing this amendment
Ht FILLMORE said he wished the gentleman would give
him the balance of the «me, that he might explain the amend
ment and the necessity of the bill
Mr ATHERTON declined doing this, saying that this
was a rule of the majornj, and they should have all the benefit
of it.
Gentleman on the other side had said they did not consider
themselves responsible for this state of aifairs, and spoke as if
the Executive was i< sponsible alone He asked whethei the
Executive had refused his assent to any measure passed by the
present majority exceptthe bank bills alonen Didnotgentle
men, by this mode of reasoning, abolish the power of Con
grees altogether^ Although they had a majority in this and
the other end of the Capitol they avowed that Congi ess are
nothing and the Executive is every thing" That was these
verest blow at the importance of Congress that had ever been
struck
What was the wisdom of this Administration, when they saw
a constantly diminishing revenue, a debt which the President
said was not owing to his Administration, when the levenue
was not sufficient to tarry on the Government, to giveaway
that pait ofthe revenue derived from the public lands1 The
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mi Cushing] had intimated
that this constantly decreasing revenue throughout Mr Van
Bureu's adminitiation was one of the burdens now falling on
this'Administration Did it relieve them from any burden to
thraw away the levenue from the public lands'* Why did they
not make thtir tax bifl at the extra session sufficient, so as to
super&ede the riec^s-uty of a loan? They had power to do
aüy thing, by any immense majority in ho h Houses of
Congress Notwithstanding the gentleman fiom Alaska
chusetts had acknowledged the constantly decreasing aid
msn/heieud revenue nfunng Mi Van fluren's Admu is
(ration, and that, although commencing that Admirmrati n
with a pubiicdebt, yet he must acknowledge, on the authority
ofiheiepoitofhis own Secretary, that,although thatAdmmis
tiation enter* d into power with a debt, all ti,e debt left by them
was about $5 GOO 000 Towards the close of Mi Van Buren'*.
administration, the expenditures weie reduced on a sliding
scale, and, notwithstanding the declaration of the gentleman
from Massachusetts, that there were burdens imposed and the
revenue insufficient, this party, professing''economy, retrench
ment, and reiorm," had started the expenditures m an upward
course, givmeaway at the aune time the proceeds of the pub
lie lands When they contemplatpri the wisdom of puch a
course, pursued hy statesmen was theie any wonder that the
ciedit ot Govert ment wa* lost?
If fhis distribution bdl had not been passed, the land sales
would not have been stopped, and theie would have been a
fund to sav#ihe Government the disci edit of the depreciation
ofthe Tjeismy notes jToi some puipo&e or othei the land
sales had been btoppcl perhaps foi the sake of creating a ne
cecity of adopting thi-> beau lful system of protection, whuh
othnwiss nut,hi be caiiediaxdtion
The idea had h^en n Jiculed of saving this sma 1 amount of
pio"eeds ofthe law,;< Had they not called this a vaht dom un,
that would enable the States to íedeein tiieircredi and sa\e
themselves fium disgiace, and yet this fund was nothing when
kept entire in the Tieasuiy of the United States' It bad a!
ready actul as an ample and sufficient pledge foi thp payment
ofthe Revolutionaiy debt The gentlemen from Kentucky
[Mr Marshall] and from Vermont [Mi Everstt] had said
that our mam difhcul y was the want of credit if that was so,
whit was the remedy, except to give an ample and sufficient
pledge foi it and not be squandering our revenue by distubu
lion, by which the ci edit of the States had not been in proved,
but it tended to imko them wasteful at the same time that they
are rapacious ind lepnved them of then firmest source of
CI edit—the puncipJe of self reliance
Gentlemen ta'ked about rc-pt nsibihty and repudiation He
could not concave of any repudiation more perfect than the
repudiation provided for hy the bifi which had received the
sanction of thi¡* Hoe^e-the bankrupt law, which was an ex
araplf-of repudiation which would do much to destroy thecie-
tht ofthe country Anotliei kind of repudiation was of banks
When 1 bank repudiated its debts, how many were ready to say,
it la for the benefit ofthe people at large? There wert  other
thmsrs thai weie calculated to destroy the credit ofthe countiy
Who «as responsible foi the present state of things—ior 'he
loss ofthe ci edit of the country-—except the present ma i iritji
Oo you wish to nuke us responsible? (said Mr A ) Repeal
the bankrupt law, lefuse to deal with banks that will not take
your paper at pai, repeal youi land bill, distributing and «quan
deung the means of Government iest<?ie the Sub Treasury,—
do that, and then you may callón us to be íesponsible, but re
store the country to the prosperous- condition m which you
found it, restore the honor and rii-dit of the nation, before you
attempt to thiow off from yourselves the responsibility
