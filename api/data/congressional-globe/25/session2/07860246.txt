tions, and calling on the patuotie of all parties to
oppose them, show any dread of consigning to them
unlimited power to cinsh one of the members ot
the Union, and which, after accomplishing that,
might be so readily turned to crush the liberty oí
all? Quite the reverse A sadden thought again
struck him He again, m a twinkling, forgot the
past, and rushed over into the arms of povvei, and
took his position in the front rank, as the champion
ot the most violent measures, to enforce laws at the
point of the bayonet, which he hid pionounced un
constitutional, unjust, and oppitssive' And this,
too, at the hazard of civil war, and ihe mam test
dangei of subverting the Constitution and hbeities
of the countrj, refusing all terms, of adjustment,
and resisting to the last with violence the bill which
compromised and settled the conflict' And jet,
with all this fresh in the recollection ot himself and
all present, he can rise in his place and proclaim
himself the univeisal patriot, the defender of the
Constitution, and benefactor of eve)y portion ol
the Union, the man who has done every thing to
preset ve brotherly love between its members, and
who is, ready to make eveiy sacrifice to malte it
beneficial to all the parties'
But what is moie extraotdmary, what is tiulj
wonderful and astonishing is, while these words
wsie on his 'ongue.he, in the sime brtath, with a
lull knowledge ot all the disastious consequences
which have and must ncctssanly iollow the re-
newal of the protective sjstetn, should declare that
he anticipates the speedy antral ot the tune when
he will again undeitake to revive the sjstem'
More cannot be added The contia-,t between the
Senator's course and the character which he as-
cribes to himoelt cannot be rendeted more sinking
I «.hall not add another instance, as man) of them
as are at my comimnd A volume could not mint
conclusively prove how unfounded are his preten-
sions to that lofty, universal, and aident patriotism
which he claims tor himselt, and how strong the
delusion under which he is in regard to his true
character
Let us now turn and inquire «hat his been m\
course, I whom hp reprtsents as sectional whose
course he pronounces lobe unfiicndlj to the Union
because I now call the ptotective sjstun mu(.insti-
tutional and oppressiu who he intimites, desire
to unite the South tor no pan otic purpist, and rc-
piesents as going off under the Statt lights banner
And here, Mi Prind nt, ltt me siv, I put in no
daim to die loíiy destiny to which the Senatoi
sa>s he was bora Instead oí coming here, like
the Senator, as tht representative ol the whole peo-
ple, I appear in the more humble chaiacter ot the
repiesentative oí one ot the States of this Union,
sent here to watch over her particular mt< lests,
and to piomote the general interest of all, as fai as
ihe Constitution has conferred power upon us, and
as it can be done a ithont oppie^sum to the parís
These are mj conceptions ot my representative cha-
racter, with the trusi confided to me, and the duties
attached to it, which I endeavor to discharge with
industry, fidelity, and all the abilities which it has
pleased my Creatoi to confer on rne instead of
falling short of what I profess, 1 tmst my public
life, it examined with candor, will show that I
have ever so mterpieted my duty to m\ State, as
to permit it in no instance to interfere with the
just claims of the Union It is my good foitune to
represent a State which holds her charac tei far
above her mtetest, and whicn claims the first place,
when a sacrifice is to be made for the safety and
happiness of all, and wculd h ild me tt stret ac-
count, ¡f, in representing her interest, 1 snonld foi-
gtt what is due to her honor among hei confede-
rates All her acts prove that she is as liheial m
inakiiigconcessions,whendemandedh> > iccommon
good, as she is prompt and resolute to rt t aggres-
sion to piomote the interest oí othei at her ex-
pense Acting in the same spirit, as her represen-
tative, I have'never failed to meet and repel aggres-
sions, while, I trust, I have, on no occasion, been
unmindful ot her honor and the general interests
of the whole Union. Having made these remarks,
i shall now proceed to show that, as humble as my
pretensions are, and as sectional and unpatriotic as
ne has thought proper to represent me, my couise
tor liberaht} and a just regard to the interest of
every poition of the Union, will not suffer in com-
parison with his, as lofty as are his pretensions
In making the inquiry I have, into the course of
the Senator m relation to the section to which I
belong, I called on him to point out a single in-
stance, with all his boasted patriotism, m which
he had given a vote to promote its interests, or done
an act to defend its rights, but now, whsn the in-
quiry is into my course m telation to his section, I
piopose to reverse the question, and to apply to
mvself a much more severe test than I did to him
I ask, then, irom what measuie, calculited to pro-
mot1 the intents of his section have I ever with-
held mj support, except, mceed, the protective
tanfi, and certain appropnations, which, according
to m> mode of const! umg the Constitution, I ¡e-
gaul as unconstitutional, and would ot course be
bound to oppose, wheievei the benefit should fall'
1 call on the Senator to point ou a single instance,
and, i! hedesues it, I will Meld him the floor in
otder to give dim an opportunity to do so Will
the Senitor cill, on hisput, tor instances in which
1 !me supported the interest of his section'! I can
point to numeróos to myeailyand constant sup-
port of the N tvv, to my resistance to the system of
onbaigoes noii-unpoitation and non-mteicourse

meiee uul nav i,riiion, in which his section has so

nothing to li gui-e% and will íeadily ansvvei If he
vould look ai home, and open his eyes to !he sjs-
teni itic and incessant attacks made on our peace
and qu ct by his constituents, it lit would mlec t on
his ihreat t > ien'« the svMimoi oppression from
which wc hive liecl ourselves with such diflisulty
md dangi r, an 1 1 ear in mind lhat we are the
we iker seetu n sod without union among our-
selves, we cannot resist the danger that surrounds
us, he will see that there n neither mjstery nor
dangei in tht tall I go farther Our union is not
only necessary to our sifety and protection, but is
also to the successful opintion of our system We
constitute the check to its ovei-aetion and, as ex-
peuence prove--, the only power through which,
when disordered, reform ition can be peaceably
i ffctted Our union is dangerous to none, and saln-
t rv to all The michme never works well when
the South is divided noi badly when it is united
The Senatoi n xt tells us that I dechred I would
inairh c fl un^er the State Rights banner, which h<
seizea on t> impugn my patriotism and to boast oi
h -5 own It is an easy task, by mis stating or gar-
bling, to distort the most eleiated or correct senti-
ment In this c?se the Senator, by selecting a sin-
gle nernber of the sentence, and throwing a strong
emphasis on "off,' ga/e a meaning dnectly the op-
p< site ot what I really did say, but it afforded htm
ah oppoitimty of representing me as abandoning
the cause of the Constitution and country, and him
self as being their champion, wh.ch it seems was
sufficient for his purpose    The declaration is taken
iiom my opening speech at the extra~session; and,
that the Senate may judge for itself, I shall give the
entue passage-
"We arc about to take a fresh start I move off under the
States Rights banner, and go in the direction in which I have
bout so long moving I seize the opportunity thoroughly to
reform the Government to bring it back to its original princi-
ples toietiench, economize, and rigidly to enforce account 
biluy I shall oppose «trenuously all attempts to originate a
new debt, to cieate a National Bank, to re umte the political and
money power (moie dangerous than Church and State,) in any
foim or shape "
This is what I did declare, and which the Sena-
tor represents as deserting the Constitution and
country, and this is the way I am usually answered.
I know not whether I have greater cause to com-
plain or icjoice at the fact that there is scarcely an
aigument or sentiment of mine, which is attempted
to be met, that is not garbled, or misstated. It I
have reason to complain of the injustice, I have at
the same time the pleasuie to reflect that it is a high
implied compl ment to the truth and correctness of
what I sav
There still remains an important chapter to com-
plete the comparison between the public character
of the Senator and myself, I mean the part which
we took in the late war between Great Britain and
this country I intended at one time to enter on it,
and to trace the rise and progress oi the war, with
its various vicissitudes oí disasters and victories,
and the part which the Senator and his political as-
sociates acted at that important period, but these
are by-gone events, belonging to the historian, in
whose hands I am content to leave them, and shall
not recur to them, unless the Senator should pro-
voke rfie heieafter by a renewal of his attack
Having now despatched the personalities of the
Senator, I turn next to his argument, which, as I
have stated, consists of three parts the preliminary
discouise on ciedit and banks, the discussion of the
question at issue, and the reply to my remarks at
this and the extra session. I shall consider each,
as I have begun, m the leverse order The argu-
ment of the Senator is indeed so miscellaneous and
loosely connected, that it is a matter of but little
importance in what order it is considered
When he announced his intention to reply to my
remarks, both at this and the extra session, I anti-
cipated that they would be met fully, if not satis-
factorily, point by point. Guess, then, my sur-
prise, on finding him pass by, without even attempt-
ing an answer to the numerous objections which I
made to the union of the political and money power,
as affecting Ihe motáis, the politics, the currency,
the industry, and piospenty of the country, which,
if the fourth part be true, is decisive of the question,
and noticing but two out oí the long list, in his
reply 11 we may judge of the strength oí those
which he has passed ovei by his inconclusive an-
swer (as 1 shall presently show) to the two which
he selected, my argument may be pronounced tobe
impregnable I shall begin with his reply to my
lemarks at the present session
It will be remembered, among other objections
against the connection with the banks, I urged that
the Government ha I no right to mike a general
deposite in bank, or receive the notes of banks in
the public dues I placed the first on the ground,
that when public money was placed in deposite in
banks, and p issed to the credit of the Government,
it was, if ever, m the Treasury, and that it could
not be drawn out and used foi any purpose, unless
undei an appropriation made by law, without vio-
lating an express provision of the Constitution,
which provides that no money should be drawn out
of the Treasury, but in consequence of appropria-
tion by law I then argued, that to place money m
general deposite in banks, with the implied under-
standmi always attached to such transactions, that
they should have the right to draw it out and use it
as they please, till called for by the Government,
was a manifest violat.on of thii  provision of the
Constitution
In support of the other objection against receiving
of bank notes in the public dues, I laid down the
known and fundamental rule oí construction on all
questions touching the powers of this Government,
that u had no right to exercise any but such as are
expressly given by the Constitution, or that may
be necessary to carry into effect the granted pow-
ers     I   then   insisted  that no such  power was
