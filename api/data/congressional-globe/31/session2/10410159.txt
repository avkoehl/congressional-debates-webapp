On the 1st day of January, 1849,
public lands surveyed and unsur-
Teyed, within the States 
Deduct ajnoust of acres
sold from the 1st Janu-
ary, 1849, to 30th Sep-
tember, 1850, as shown
by Commissioner But-
terfieJd's report 2,139,584
Located by Mexican *
bounty land warrants, 7.213,600
345,913,346
& i
Swamp land, by act of
Cgngress, 28th Sep-
tember, 1850 20,785,366
Granted to the Mobile
and Chicago Railroad,
by act of Congress, the
20th September, 1850,
supposing they get all
by law allowed, being
public, on the line of
road, which is not at
all probable  2,232,560
Bounty land to officers
and soldiers of the va-
rious wars since 1790,
by act 28th September,
1850, and the amount
necessary to pay out-
standing Mexican war-
rants 16,000,000 48,431,110
Leaving a balance of public lands
within the States, California not
included  197,482,250
Add to this amount the Territories
of Nebrasca, Minnesota, east of
the Rocky Mountains  477,173,760
West of the Rocky Mountains,
embracing Utah and Oregon  218,536,220
California and New Mexico  336,689,920

termed the Compro-
mise, or Pearce's Dill,

1,285,735,516

ted States,)...      159,754,640
It must be borne in mind, there are many pri-
vate claims in the late purchase from Mexico, as
well as grants to actual settlers, and private claims
in Oregon, which must be deducted.
It is frequently stated that the Government has
not as yet received as much money for the public
land as it has cost. It may not be improper to
state, from the various reports of Commissioners
of Public Lands, (Messrs. Young and Butterfield,)
I find that statement to be incorrect, which may
be seen from the following calculation:
Amount of lands sold within theStates
up to first of January, 1849, are
100,209,556 acres, at an average of
$1 35 per acre <136,772,677
Since first of January, 1849, up to
30th September, 1850, 2,199,584
acres, at an average of jjl 31 £ per
acre  2,886,676
Total amount sold 102,409,140 acres,
and total amount received $139,659,353
Amount paid for lands as
shown by report of
Commissioner Butter-
field, for 1850, inclu-
ding the amounts paid
France for Louisiana,
to Spain for the Flori-
das, and forextinguish-
ing Indian titles 061,121,717
Expenses for surveying,
&c....?  6,369,839
For selling, Ac..    7,466,324
Add to this amount—paid
Texas for purchase,
1850, by Pearce's bill. 10,000,000
Amount paid Mexico,
(supposed,) including
claims assumed   18,000,000-102,957,880
Excess over and abovethe cost ofland. $36,691,473
Having shown (as near as can be) that the Gov-
ernment has thus far been reimbursed for all she
has paid out, and has an excess of over $36,000,000
for actual cost of lands, besides having given
away for various, purposes to her citizens, in way
of bounties, for internal improvements,and school
purposes, (not including grants to the soldiers
previous to 1836,) over sixty-five millions—say
65,219,311 acres — still having at her disposal
1,285,739,516 acres.
Trusting she will still be liberal with this valu-
able inheritance, in donating to legitimate objects,
such as railroads to Alabama and other States
where they run through public land, as well as to
every poor man a home, that generations rising
up may say: My country above all others;
for it is truly the land of the brave and a home
for the poor.
I will, in conclusion, append to my remarks a
few extracts from reports of Lewis Troost, Esq.,
and Charles F. M. Garnett, Esq., chief engineers,
which contains valuable information, such as will
be read with great pleasure by many of the citizens
of the United States, and particularly Alabama,
whose interests are so intimately woven with this
work.
APPENDIX.
The Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad is
emphatically a State and & National enterprise.
The State of Alabama embraces within its limits
an area of about 50,275 square miles. The Ten-
nessee river runs through the northern part of the
State, from its northeast to its northwest corner.
South of the Tennessee river a mountain range,
being the southern extremity of the great Appa-
lachian chain, extends nearly parallel' with the
river, from the east to the west boundary of the
State. The waters, rising in the southern slope of
this mountain range, drain the middle and southern
sections of the State, and form the Coosa, Talla-
poosa, Cahawba, Warrior, Tombeckbee, and Ala-
bama rivers. By this disposition of the moun-
tains and rivers, three grand natural divisions of
the State are constituted, viz:
1st. The northern division, having an area of
7,255 square miles, north of the mountain range,
deprived of a natural communication with the mid-
dle and southern divisions, and having access to
a market, for a part of the yew: only, by a tedious
and dangerous navigation ofTrom 1,400 to 1,800
miles by the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi
rivers.
2d. The middle division, having an erea of
22,000 square miles south of the mountain range,
extending to the parallel of 32° 30' north latitude,
at the head of the navigable waters of the Bay of
Mobile, and dependent on ilat-boats and upon
wagons over badly graded earth roads as the means
of transportation for its productions.
3d. The southern division, having an area of
21,020 square miles, extending to the southern
boundary of the State and to the Gulf of Mexico,
and drained by a system of rivers unsurpassed in
navigable utility.
We thus perceive that of the State of Alabama,
a seventh part is commercially, and therefore so-
cially and politically, a distinct memberof the State,
compelled by natural barriers to trade and identify
itself in interest with other States and communities,
and that over one third part of the State has only
a temporary, uncertain, and expensive outlet for
its productions and communication with its sea-
port.
An enterprise, therefore, which, like this rail-
road, commence# at the northern limit of that di-
vision of the State open to a free and uninterrupt-
ed navigation to the Gulf of Mexico, which passes
through and connects those divisions of the State
deprived of an outlet for their productions, which
unites all of them by bonds of interest, which affords
the safest, most certain, and capable means of
transit and transport, and which will develop rich
and incalculable mineral resources, must be em-
phatically a great State work.
It is a national enterprise. Take a map of the
United States, trace the connections which it will t
make by its- proposed branch with the railroads
now completed and in contemplation, and with
rivers, and you will observe that it connects
the Gulf of Mexico with the South Atlantic, Mid-
dle, Western, and North Atlantic States.
DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRT.
Geological Character.—From Selma to about
eight miles ofMontevallo the route runs over sand
and loose gravel deposits; thence it passes into
the carboniferous and the siJurian orders of rocks,
through which important formations it continues
to its terminus at Gunter's Landing, running,
however, on the east side of the Coosa river, m
eight or ten miles of the western edge of the meta-v
moiphic rocks.
