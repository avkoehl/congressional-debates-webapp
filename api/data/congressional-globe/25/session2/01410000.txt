COMMONWEALTH BANK Or BOSTON
Mr   WLBS'l ER rose to submit the following
resolution
Resohed, Tnat the Secretary of the Treasury be
requested to obtain information, and lay the same
before the Senate, with as U't'e de'ay as possible,
respecting any payment-, ot pensions, by the late
pension agent ot Boston, oi ol fishing bounties, íe-
eently made b) the coilectoi at Bos'on, m bills of
the Commonwealth Bank ot that cit>, and the
w hole amount of sucn payments, and that he fm-
tliei inform the Senate by what authonty or dircc
tion payment of such pensions and bounties has
been made m such bills, and that he fuithei intoim
the Senate whether any, and, it anv, how much, oí
the public money of the United States is in deposite
at said bank, and, if any of such money be therein
deposited, at « hat time or times such deposites were
made
la Dresentlng this resolution, Mr W s-aid he
felt it to be his duty to call the attention of the Se-
nate to the circumstances here alluded to, at the
earliest opportunity, in order to the institution of an
official inquiry into the facts of the case, and to ob-
tain information with íespect to the manner m
which the duty of public offices had been d s-
chatged, m reluence to the causes, by which a se-
veie loss had been made to tall upon a large num-
ber of industrious and m< ruonous citizens Mr
W did not submit this reoolutioi lorinquiv oithe
giound of mere neispapei rumor lío hid re-
ceived letters from highly íespectable puvate
sources, mfoimmg him of the general facts ot the fj
case He understood the case to bt that, at the
period when the fishing bounties became due—mo-
ney well and hardly earned, by a 1 iboriou-,, indus-
trious, and worthy class of citizens—application for
payment was made to the Collector at Boston, he
being the officer cnarged on the part of the Govern-
ment with the duty and business of paying this
money That officer paid the fishermen, not as the
law directs, in specie, or bills equivalent to specie,
but in the In'Is ot this now broken bank, or in
checks upon it, which, checks, ot course, it was
known would not be paid in, specie Mr W had
been given to understand that this officer refused io
pay the bounty due in Treasury no'es, when asked
to do so, and that he le'used also to pay the money
in spec K,akhou¿u requested, and that, substintially
and m effect, the parties entitW to payment were
put to the option of taking th1 paper of this bank,
oi of tal in^ nothing at all1 This, h  said, was his
infoimation
Mr. W held in hi« had a letter from one of the
moat considerable fishm? towns in the Stale,
namely, Marblehead, and he was fheteby mfoimed
that, veiy shortly before this bank failed, that is,
within a week or two, oi some such peuod, toe
money due from Go vet nment to these hshermenhad
been paid in the manner described, a large amount
of it entirely m the bills and notes of this bank
The whole amount ot bills ot this bank paid out
by the Gov eminent officer on the part of Govern
ment, Mi W could not tell In Marblehead alone
his lettfii mentioned ten thousand dolíais, dnii , e
heard of owei similai payments, in othei lining
lepoit said, the wtiole amounting to fifty or i bun-
dled tho ase1  I dolíais, and pi d out when t le bank
\uis on t ve i ve of a total crash, <md within a feu
days ol its failure'
Well, sn, (continued Mr W ) wnon the mo  e\
in these large quantities had been pa d out, tee
bank failed, and all that these pooi fisf-pnnen
had received m payment fiom the tinited States i 
now dead on their hands
Mr W wished that a propei inquiry should be
n ade b) Congress into mch a state ot thing >, a id
for thi.. object he had drawn the attention of the
Senate to the circumstances of the case, with a
view to the obtaining of information on two points
1st, As io the facts how fai the public officer of the
Government had been engaged in jajingout the
notes oi this bank foi the dues of the United
States, and, 2dly, As to the authouty that is, by
what legal authouty the officer of the United States
Government had made such paj meats, and whe-
ther it «as done by the direction of the Secretary of
of the Treasury, or whether it had been permitted
and allowed by him
Mr W. thought that however much gentlemen
might differ in opinion as to the resolution of 1816,
whether that resolution was the law of the land, or
w hether it were a mere recommendation or admoni-
tion, as some had maintained, (though Mr W
mmsclf had always considered it to be a law,) how-
ever that question mighfbe settled, Mr W had
thought that the law now existing, respecting pay-
ments by the Government, was at least clear and
indisputable, so that no one would venture to de-
lend the act oi the Government, of paying m notes
of banks known to be of less value than specie.
Mi W. begged to refer to the solemn enactment
of Congress, made only two years ago It would
be found in the second section of the appropriation
bill of 14th April, 1836, and is as follows
"Stc 2 And le ü further enacted, That hereafter
no bank notes of less denomination that ten dol-
lars, and that from and after the third day of March,
anno Domini eighteaii hundred and thirty-seven, no
bank notes of less denomination toan twenty dol-
lars, shall be offered m payment m any case what-
soever in which money is to I e paid by the United
Stales or the Post Office Depart nent, nor shall any
bank note of any denomination be so offered, un-
less the same shah bt payable, and paid on de-
man 1, in gold or silver coin, at the place where is-
sued, and which shall not be equivalent to specie
at the place where ofleied, and convertible into gold
oi silver upon the spot, at ihe will of the holder,
and without delav or los> to him Provided, That
nothing herein contained shall be construed to make
any thing but gold or silvei a legal tender by an in-
dividual, or by the United States "
Would any gentleman rise up and sav, m the
veiy teeth ot the law, that tb  passing of these
large amounts of notes, Jtnown not to be equiva-
len i to specie, and immediately beiore the failure of
the bank, was leg<d, was justifiable, either oir the
pan of Government or its officers? Th law ex-
píes ly says " no public officer shall offer in pay-
ment bank bills not equivalent to specie on the
spot vv here they aie offered " Will it be said that
the United S ales officer in the pitsent instance did
not know that these notes were not equivalent tj
specie^ This is not possible, he knew this bank,
like others, had not paid speeie since May last, and
tha* since that time its bills have not been equiva-
lent to specie Or will it be said he did not know
the law? Certainly the Secretary of the Treasury
must have drawn the attention of all disbursing
officers to this act oí Congress
Mr. W thought it possible that it migut be said,
in excuse of this transaction, that these pooi fisher-
men and pensionéis took this now worthless mo-
ney voluiitauly, or at their own option But
whether the individual who is to be pa d may be
madt willing to take such irredeemable paper or
n t, ihe law is direct and peremptory, and prohioits
the ofbeer from offering it The cons ut of an in
dividual, therefore, to take it, especia'ly when h 
can get nothinK else, will not jus'lfy that violation
m a quarter But what consent can that be
c         cd, vvbet    Oiun'ary  taking is there in such
Ct-ses, ■« nere a man, because he cannot get all that
is di - to him, lsiompelled to take part, rather than
have noie"* Wat is there \oluntary abont if!
This is coercion and not consent Congress
has not jet admitted #he notion, and Mr W
hoped it never would, that the receipt of paper
under pai was voluntary, whenever officers of Go
\ eminent could prevail,on those who were entitled
io the payment of money from the United States to
take it under the penalty of getting nothing His
letter, indeed, said that specie had been asked for,
and wao refused, that, whether asked for or not, or
