some dark hints about "contra uons and expansión^ and rev til

declaration 'In our domestic concerns there is every tiling to

How unknown is the mysteuous future even to the most saga
Clous' In two short months the suspensión comes—not partial,
as had repeatedly happened be lore w thout pioduemg much of
a shock, but univer-al It now becan e the in^eie-, ifthepiity
in power to chanee «ides and wtitediwn he banks, and write
upthis scheme theyso bitterly derided in l-v¡4—t íescheme that
liad been denounced by the almost undivided voice of the parly
now in power The identical proposiuon rcceiv i íg but one \ an
Buren vote in this House upon Oordm's reso a .« pronounced
hvthe official organ, (that never dared «peak upon uiiy great
financial question ol this kind, but as dii tt ted b> die Pre sident, he
moved and stimulated by Van Buren and B iton,)d¡> íisorgam-
sing revolutionary, subversive ot the fundamental puncipesof
our Government and of its entire prac ices loni 17-13 down to
this day Airain, from the same paper ' It i- as palpable a  the
sun, that the effect of this schemt (a'las the SubTreasuiy)
would be to bring the public treasuie much rearer theac'ual
custody and control of the Executive than it is now, and expose
it tobe plundered by a hundred hands, wheie one cannot now
reach tt '
Again 'Had such a suggestion come fiom Gen Iackson.it
would have been rung thiough the Old Dominion See how he
wishes to put the public money directly in the palms of his
friends and partisars, instead of keep, lg it on deposi e in
banks, whence it cannot bedrawn lor other than public purposes
without certain detection. In such a rase, we should feel that
the people had just cause of alarm, and oughttogive their most
watchful attention to suenan effort to en'arge Executive powei,
and put in its hands the rrean of coriuption " Astain, same
organ—mark this "It is well known that the Presah nt him elf
is opposed to this proiect, an i that his fiiends in Washington,
whetherof the cabinet or not, heartily concur with him in the
C9Urse o pohcy it is expeehent lo pursue " Again, the same
organ "il Gen Jackson had suggested surh a system, (the sub
Treasury,) what peals of patriotic indignation would have
burst from eloquent Senators against the usurper and tyrant
who desired to get the millions ol the Tieasurv into the very
hands of his partisans and parasites " Again 'WeveulyLe
lleve that the present system (State banks) of deposites for the
public money, regulated by law asitwili be, is as good for safe-
ty, and the least hable to abuse by the Lxerutive, of any which
the wit of mancan conceive : Now, sir, 1 havenot read these
extracts to prove to the House whit vveie the opinions of the
Editor of the Globe in reference to this scheme ol a Sub Trea
sury in 1334, no, sir, that would be a small business My pur
pose in reading these extiacts is to show this House, and this
nation, what were the views of the party at W aJnngton in
1834, a« avowed in the official organ published at the very doors
of the President and cabinet, speaking by authority the sentí
menta of ihe party upon this scheme of a Sublieasuiy \ou
have it here expressly admitted, had Gen Jackson aelvocated

party in power, having been Used and abused until, by their aid
the party had "demolished" the Dink of the United Mate s act

lent somerset, as you know, llave no doubt, by woful ex
penence,Mr Chairman, for any man to rrake who had any
regard for political consistency, moral inteirity, oi mture rey u

ated at the very contemplation, and the history ol the times re
cords many noble examples now illustrating in political exi'9,
 nd bearing Willi self approbating and self consoling composure

of patriotism over tl e shackles of party, or the allurements of
ai ibmon To their names will immoital honor attach, to their
repulí ion let undj ng piaise he given, statue* should beereit
ed to then memories Hut, sir, how was this «chen e lobe
bioache ! to the courtly'' Here was a doubl  lmpo-ttue to he
earned nt one nnve upon the political chess boaid Ihe favoi
lte i et banks were not only to be repudiated, denounced, ' di
voiced, from all i onnection with the Government and the par
tv, but this 'disorganizing and rev lutionaiv," this ' usmping
and ty anuical scln me was to be substituted in their place
Su,I ha-nrd the assertion to be submitted to any impartial man,
that il e history ol all i.mes past does not furnish in hei political
arna's, a move soreculess of all decent íespect foi the |i st
judün ent of mankind for the intelligence of the people, for (he
intelligence of Conines?, the people's represe ntatives, omil'ing
the tie cheiy, the peifidy, and ingratitude towards the State
b inks Hut, su, the mensure had to be attempted and accom
phshed, or the party sink The Bank of the United Sta'es had
been put down and decried as a monster, the State bank sy-tern,
m despite of all the puffing and blowing, had realized tin pro
phecits of a'l the sagacious statesmen of the day, the ^ub
Treasury which had slumbered from 1829, but which, by the
bv, had been the favorite bantling of the present Thief Magis
ttate, and the "great expunger," as I will demonstrate be oie I
am d me, they tolerated lor party purposes the most violent
maledictions, to be poured out upon us unshaped head, exer-
cising viailantcau ion themselves to let slip no word of denun
ciation.matk this, Mr Chairman, whilst you and otln rs were
used ao the blind dupes of party, to carry out the grand drama
of [ n ling down the United States Bank by the use of the -"Uto
bulks, as a hilfway house, to make way for this magnificent
scheme of finance The "grea« humbugger" and the Little
Mt'ician" kept their mouths hermetically sealed, a stud ed si.
lenceon their part was preserved An impeiietiable cuitain
was kept hung up between these two masterspirits and the
blind instruments of party t' ey were using, asso many puppets,
to cairy out their dark and damning deeds of policy But the
question came up, hew is this movement to be effected' Did the
President dare propose it in his own namei No, sir, he was too
sagacious to be caught in that trap He knew full well that
such a measure, bearing simply his endorsement, though the
Cmef Magistrate of the nation, would never pass the ordeal of
pul lie approval, he thought of the party laudation upon the
St ue banks, he thought of the party denunciations of the Sub
Tieasury scheme in 1834, he knew that the weight of his naire
as authority, though in office, when opposed to that of Genernl
.Tacksunat the Hermitage, was as agramofsandcompaied with
the mountain He knew that he lived, and breathed, and moved
in the poli'ica' atmosphere of the old Hero The car of State
being in the mué, Hercules had to be called to the wheels before
sh* could be moved from her fastness, believing and "boasting"
that his popularity could stand any thing and every tin ig Ac
cordin< !v, in the month of July, 1837, a letter is concocted by
the'great humbugger," forwarded to the Hermitage, sent to
Washington with the signature of the old Hero, published in the
official oigan, branding the pet banks and merchants with
"trea-hery and perfidy " Whata shameful abuseof the name,
the ajthonty, the popularity of an old soldier, to bolster up a
sinking party at (he sacrifice of the public goed But, Mr
Chairman, still more humiliating and mortifying to the heart of
tl e patriot, is that thi  scheme is now about to be consummated
in the shape of a solemn statute A scheme, before that God to
whom I am lesponsible for whatl am about to say, 1 believe the
annals of human delusion cannot furnish an example of more
impudent, audacious, and monstrous imposture A scheme
which the Administra ion are, at least for a time, about to palm
forciblv and unwillingly upon the people of the United States,
utderthe flimsy and deceitful guise of returning to the "consti-
tutional currencv," the primitive simplicity of "a hard money
Government " Nothing can transcendits audacity, us ttiocity,
whethe r w e look at the means of accomplishment or the end to
be achieved
The conduct of the vile seducer is not blacker than the con
duct of the lnling party towards these State institutions When
the war commenced upon the United States Bank, these htate
banks were in successful operation, treading in the line of du'y,
pursuing the dictates of prudence and virtue, doing a safe and
profitable business for themselves and the country, the * serpent
came among^therr, lie courted, flattered, wooed,and threatened
them, he finally overcame their resisiance to importunities,
they yielded to gilded piomises of profit and protection, they
w ere used and abused in meretricious association, until the pur
pose of the party was accomplished, the excesses, forced upon
them by (heir alliance, weakened them, and made them an easy
prey, they are turned upon, and slandered, repudiated and dis
carded
I now proceed to trace the political course of the Missouri
Senator upon the measure befoie the committee and its associ
a ed measures, particularly tie State bank system lexpectto
establish upon him and our Chief Magistrate a degree ol trea-
chery, perfidy, and ingratitudetowaids those institutions, and of
t'ehnquency and n fidelity of public trust to the countrv, un-
parelleled mthe anna's of human actions These, Eir, are strung
clnrees, high imputations hut I confidently expect to mike
them gool ShouP I not, I will be |ustly branded as a willul
libe'ler Shoull I succeed in sustaining my chaiges with proof,
incontestable piool, I confidently hojc these pub'ic officers will
receive the judgment du° their political delinquency, so long
m< me lat the ban 's of a deceived and eleluded people, for'eiture
ol public confidt nee and expulsion from their high stations as
soon as ihe forms of the Constitution will permit I shall offer
no controveitedor debatable testimony in support of these alle-
gations, I shall rely exclusively upon facts, recorded facts fiom
their own speeches and S>tatepa| ers Yes, sir,out of their own
mouths shall they stand convicted of every charge 1 have pre-
firred Who, unniqnainied with the political history of this
cou try pi lor to lc37, would conceive it possible in the nature of
human cl ang"alnlitv, that either of these distinguished person
acesliave ever at'rocated a paper monev system, and the worst
p irt of the system, the State banks'! Every honest man would
answer, it cannot be so, it is too base, too profi sate He would
exclaim, theinfamy that would follow the establishment of such
a fact, would blacken the character of a fiend of hell itself I
am not resporsib'e forronsequencee, they belong to the actors
I am handlms facts and facts I intend te use, cut whom they
mav and howevei deep they mav. I place the "great ex
puntrer" l upon ihe witness stand, I appeal to his recorded
confessions, undisputed and indisputable, against himself and
* Amos Kendall,
his accomplice, the present Chief Magistiale, who I know will
not question the creelibiluy of the wuuess I now read from the
speech «1 the Missouri Senator, dehveied in 1834, upon the bill
t-> recharter die Bank of the United States "Mr B deprecated
the spiut which had broken out asainst the Stale banks, it was
b spirit which augured badly for the rights of the States, those
oanks are created by the Slates, and the work3 of the States
aught to be respected, the stock in these banks were held by
Aintiican ci u zens, and ought not to be lniunously assail d.
1Ue spirit of hosu ny to the Ma e banks Is of recent origin, and
-eemed tokecppai e with the spintof attack upon the political
luhtsof the htates " But, sir, this s not all, in the same
speech, hesays 'Thercs lution of k>16, admitting the notes
of all specie paying banks to receiv ability in the payment of
Kderal dues It was a resolution of cardinal importance for
the regulation ol local piper currency The efect it hid in
rectifying and pu.irymg a ihsordeied currency had been too
mueh overlooked Its professed object was to íegulatethe cur-
urn) of the State bank-, and to regulate it by the power of th 
I ederil Government, t rouah the agency of the 'treasury De
putment" Again, from a speech delivered in 183G, in the
Senate, upon the Specie Cncular, we find this language "Ne-
ver before didthe prospenty of the country equal the piesent
tune Never was there such exuberance of piospenty "
Again, in same speech "No longer can banks set themselves
above law and above Government, no longer can they stop
I a^ meiit " Now, sir, I will read an extract from a speech of
this session, made upon the bill under consideraron Speaking
of these same State bai ks, hesa\s "Sir, what is the banking
of the United States, but the tail the fungus, the excrescence of
the Butish paper system' What is it but this, look at it in all
its parts, m the aggregate as well as Ihe segregrate,and see what it
is—how weak in itself—how dependent ui on others Tl t
banks of the South and W. st, built upon the sandy foundation
of borrowed papei,and dependent upon those ofthe Northeast,
those of the Northeast are dependent upon the paper fabnc of
England, ihe whole banking system of the I mted States has its
centre in London " Now, sir, let us pause for a moment, and
analyze these various passages This honorable Senator, in
1^.34, deprecates any disparagement of the State banks, as a
violent a-sault upon State Right , asa wanton attack upen the
"stock ol American citizens ' But what more? He eulogize 
the revolution of ISIIj, the instrument of the first legalized
union of the Guvernment and the State banks, known to the
history of our legislation, lauds i 3 "simplicity," its "efficien.
cy" in "regulating," "tectifying," and 'purifying" the disor-
ders of the local paper currency And how is this giest
desideiatum ellected'' Hear him "By the power of the Fede-
ral Government through the agency of the Treasury Dpart-
mem ' And howl By a "divorce" of the Government reve.
russ from tne banks'1 No, sir By exacting Government dues
in gold and silver, as this bill proposes"1 no, sir But by
receiving btate bank paper in discharge of all dues to the Go-
vernment—a complete union of bank and state And yet m
tc40, the same Senator denounces these same State banks, "these
institutions of the States," to have been at the time of thefe
vindica ions and eulogies, as well as now, the tail, tie
fungus, the mere excrescence of the British papel system, hav.
in? no solid foundation, denounces the union of the Governmert
with the State banks, "as recommended by Jefferson" to Presi.
dent Washington, and opposed hy Hamilton, "as rank Fede-
ralism " I wnl now show that the Senator of Missouri "nd tha
Chief Magistiate were one and the same, Castor and Pollux,
twin brothers, in then financial and cuirency views, opinions
and policy In doing this, 1 will demonstrate, from documer-
tary testimony, authorities that no friend ofthe party in power
will ispute, that it never was the intention of the piesent Chief
Magistrate, or of theMissoun Senator, to continue a permanett
connection of tlie Government with the State banks, that tliey
only intended the league to la=t until 1 y alliance with these n -
stannous, they could succted in demolishing the United States
Bai k "i e=, s i, the pi i fidious a d treacherous stratagem wag
conceived arel consummated of enlisting the co operation of Ub
S'ate banks, to aid the work of "demolition" upon the monster,
regardless ofthe ultimate ruin ofthe State institutions, oi of tip
pros| erity of the country Now, for the proof of this proposi-
tion, 1 read fiom theoffictal organ of 1839, an amele upon this
point, eveiv word of which I hold the President responsible for
and so will th" country He feeds and fosters and clothes tl e
dirty kennel by his patronage, reads it every morning befoie
bieaklasi rolls its willul falsehoods and filthy slandeis under
histnrgue assn manysweet morsels It does not publish any
thing he does not authoiize oi approve Hear the article
'Let these who now inveigh against the ernploymentof State

ther it was possible forGeneral lacksontoaccomplishhis object
b> any other means. If he ha 1 proposed a separation from all
banks, he would have forced all the State banks and their
friends in full and effective alliance with the Bank ofthe United
States " In connection with this article, I read from a speech of
the Missouri Senator upon this po>nt, delivered this session,
upon this lull 'If any one asks when it was I commenced to
laboi for the estiblisl ment ol an Independent Treasury, 1
answfr, I bejín this 'abor on the day I began my labor to ter-

wis m ihe (esscssion of the t.vo precise privileges, which
