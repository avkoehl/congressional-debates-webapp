HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 30, 1864.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: My picket-line has advanced nearly to the woods, and until it drew the enemy's fire. We are bringing in the wounded rebels with our own. I have Colonel Christian, of the Forty-ninth Virginia, wounded in three places. He reports that Colonel Terrill was killed before he (Colonel Christian) was wounded. Two other colonels lie dead, and probably Brigadier-General Ramsey [Ramseur?], as an officer answering to the description given by Colonel Christian now lies upon the field in advance of our pickets. I have sent out, however, to bring in the body in order to substantiate the report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864.

General WARREN:

SIR: I have placed my Third Brigade on Griffin's left. It does not quite close the interval, but I think it safe, as there is a fish pond and ravine between them, which cannot be well passed by any one.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
