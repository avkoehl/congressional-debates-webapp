HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, December 19, 1864.

(Received 11.30 a.m.)

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing unusual along our lines. One deserter from Pickett's division provost guard and two refugees came in last night, one engineer, Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, and a banker from Petersburg. They are very intelligent and seem to tell very correct stories. The engineer knows all the localities along the line of railroad leading into Petersburg, and I deem it very important that Major Brooker, First Connecticut Artillery, Battery 4, should question him so as to learn the probable effect of our firing upon the railway and bridge. They have a rumor that Savannah has fallen and that Jeff. Davis is dead.
