The aggregate loss in the two engagements in as follows:

Killed......................111

Wounded.....................289

Missing.....................231

---

Total.......................631

The missing are either prisoners or killed. Most of them were captured on the mountain on the 14th.

Captain Whiting and Lieutenant John Birney, C. S. Army, of my staff, were both wounded. They, with Captain Greene Peyton,assistant adjutant-general, discharged their respective duties with ability and gallantry.

The subjoined tabular statement* will exhibit the loss in the respective regiment of the brigade in both engagement. The enemy's loss in both engagements was far heavier than mine. I believe they lost three to my one at Sharpsburg, and at least two to one on the mountain.

Respectfully submitted.

Brigadier-General.
