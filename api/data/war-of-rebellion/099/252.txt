Captain KELLEY, or

SAMUEL C. GALE,

Parkersburg, Va.:

I telegraphed you Saturday night without reply asking in reference to navigation and ice this morning. Please advise me immediately and also to-morrow morning early.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

142.] CINCINNATI, January 22, 1865.

W. PRESCOTT SMITH,

Baltimore, Md.:

Your three dispatches of yesterday received. I telegraphed you fully late last night. A dense for for the last thirty hours suspended navigation entirely, hence we have only forwarded to 6 p. m. this day about 6,000; are now loading and expect to get off to-night 2,000 more. Shall probably send 3,000 to 4,000 more to-morrow, all by Columbus. If it is certainly safe to send by river shall probably send 6,000 to 7,000 to Parkersburg by boat to-morrow evening or next day. Will advise you in the morning. I am confident we are acting most prudently in the course we are pursuing-have been surrounded by doubt and uncertainty. Will reserve most of the animals and artillery for the last.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

143.] CINCINNATI, January 22, 1865.

W. PRESCOTT SMITH,

Baltimore, Md.:

I suppose you are advised that the destination has been changed to Alexandria. Some of the troops have orders for Annapolis. Please immediately give such orders as will prevent going to Annapolis and send them directly to Alexandria. Columbus is instructed to promptly notify your agent at Wheeling of the force of all trains passing. Answer.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
