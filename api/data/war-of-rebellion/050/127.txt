GENERAL NEGLEY'S HEADQUARTERS, ONE AND A HALF MILES FROM CRAWFISH SPRING, RIGHT SIDE OF ROAD GOING SOUTH,

September 19, 1863-12 m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: General Sheridan is up, and General McCook is closing his left up. Am of opinion that firing on General Negley's front is a demonstration to attract your attention from another point, although General Beatty has twice asked for re-enforcements. I think he is all right while he has nothing hurt and no musketry firing yet. "I can't see it." As soon as General McCook is in position he intends drawing off Negley's right and letting them come if they want to. All will be in shape very soon. As soon as General McCook has established headquarters, I will send you word or join you with the information.

Very respectfully,

ARTHUR C. DUCAT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Inspector-General.

P. S.-General McCook and self have examined the ground beyond where his right will rest, and will now select the ground for position here. Firing on General Negley's front has ceased.

NEAR McDANIEL'S [McDONALD'S] HOUSE,

[September 19,]1863-12 m.

[General ROSECRANS:]

GENERAL: General Thomas, whom I have met on his second line, wishes me to say that one of his brigades was this morning attacked by overwhelming force and driven back, and two others have since been driven. General Thomas says that he is now holding his position, and has ordered up General Reynolds. He thought General Palmer was on his right, but found he was not. Thinks he is moving in now. General Brannan has driven the enemy across the creek and turned their right. Enemy opposite from Joe Johnston's army. All on Thomas' left appears quiet. General Thomas expects to drive the rebels as soon as Reynolds and Palmer get up.

Respectfully,

G. BURROUGHS,

Lieutenant of Engineers.

HOUSE,September 19, 1863-1 p.m.

General GORDON GRANGER,

Rossville:

Please give me the state of affairs with you. The enemy are fighting me with very heavy forces. We have taken many prisoners from Virginia regiments and Johnston's army, showing Bragg has been re-enforced from both.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
