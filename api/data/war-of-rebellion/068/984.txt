ATLEE'S, May 10, 1864.

General B. BRAGG:

I have recommended that the dismounted men of the Cavalry Corps be organized and sent to Hanover Junction, to report to Colonel Bradley T. Johnson. I think by this arrangement that he could be re-enforced nearly 1,000 men, they doing us no good. If you can send me an engine and a few cars to Atlee's Station I can send him this evening 250 dismounted men, who are drilled and organized into companies. Courier reports my pickets at Cold Harbor driven in; think probably that it is only a scouting party of the enemy.

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to the Adjutant and Inspector General.

The suggestion is a very good one. The men are not needed here, and would secure General Lee's communications, and be ready to join when their horses come up.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
