Enyart commanding, opposite Bridgeport; Second Brigade, Brigadier-General Whitaker commanding, at Shellmound; Third Brigade, Colonel William Grose commanding, at Whiteside's.

Orders from department headquarters had been previously received directing me to march the brigades from Shellmound and Whiteside's [except two regiments and the artillery to be left as garrison at each post] to Lookout Valley, and report for orders to Major-General Hooker. The occupancy of the roads, however, for the passage of troops of General Sherman's command, induced a modification of the orders from day to day.

On the morning of the 23rd ultimo, the two brigades commenced their march. Six regiments of the Second Brigade [Brig. Gen. W. C. Whitaker] left Shellmound at 8 a.m., and six regiments of the Third Brigade [Colonel Grose commanding] left Whiteside's at 10 a.m., and after a march of 21 and 13 miles, respectively, were reported to Major-General Hooker during the afternoon of the same day.

The garrison left at Shellmound consisted of One hundred and fifteenth Illinois, Colonel Moore commanding; Eighty-fourth Indiana Volunteers, Major Neff commanding; Fifth Indiana Battery, Lieutenant Alfred Morrison commanding; and that left at Whiteside's of Thirtieth Indiana Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel O. D. Hurd commanding; Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, Captain John E. Walker commanding; Battery H, Fourth U. S. Artillery, Lieutenant H. C. Cushing commanding.

The following twelve regiments from the two brigades of the division constituted my field command, to wit:
