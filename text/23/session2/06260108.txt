"The chances of pi ize money aie as the

Mr WATiisE said that imoortant qaestions,
like the piescnt, musí frequently have then con-
clusion, upon the sime ptin^iples which actuated
the fram\-i s of the Government—m the pnnciple
of co npiomise fie wis satisfied that the filends
of the bill befoio tie House could only accom-
plish then mam objects by a resort to the pnnci-
ple to which he alluded He had risen foi the
puipose of moving to strike fiom the bill ceifm
passages which appealed obnoxious to some gen-
tlemen They vv^ie the san", with one 01 two
exceptions, \v IikIi were embiaeed in the piopo-
sition of the genth m in fiom Kentucky, [Mi
Pope] His propcitioi, he conceived, would
present a f in gioand of compromise, and as no
member, so fn as 1 e had understood, was op
posed to giving adequ ite pay to those employed
in the naval seiv ce, the House would, by mutual
concessions, be enabled, he hop d, to come to a
decision of the q íestion withoutfurther difficulty
He,theiefore, moved to amend the bill by sinking
out all that put 1 litmg to extia allowances and
to laisiiig 1 fund by deducting thiee pei cent
fiom the piy of'he commission and wairant
officers, foi the leliel of the relatives of deceased
officers

FRENCH  SPOLIATION BILL
Th  Senate resumed tne consideration of the
bill making compensation foi Fiench spoliations
piior to 1800   when
Mi WRiGHT spoke at length in opposition
to the object and punciples of the bill
When Mi   W  concluded,
Mi WEBSTER rose and remaiked that he
hoped he should not be called on to speak, except
to reply finally tca'l the gentlemen who intended
speaking in opposition to the bill
Mi KIIN G said if the Senatoi from Massachu-
setts would paidon him, he would, before the
ciuestion was taken on engrossing the bill, say
something in justification of the vote he should
gut lit did not, howevei, piopose to go fully
into the subiect He had mide no legulai prep-
aiation, with a view of doing so But some of
those fi lends with whom he had been very much
in t' e habit of acting, especially on question 
lequinng a defense ol the public Treasuiy, had
advoca'ed the claims of those interested in the
passage of the bill, with a degree of labor, zeal,
an dappaient earnestness of feeling which afforded
the best possible evidence of then entire convic-
tion of the piopue'y of the couise they had
adopted and he therefore felt it a íesppct dup to
them, as well as ajustification of himself, to give
at least some of the reasons why lie should differ
with them upon t! e present occasion
Mi K^aid he should be brief, for the reason
fi st statecF In fact, ho did not think the bill
called foi a veiy wid íange of discussion For
al hough the • istory of the claims was along one,
ai d the f lets and documents connected with them
pumeio is, jet 1' would be seen fiom the discus-
sion, so fir as 1 eard, that the facts necessai/ to
be known and understood toduectoui judgment
upon tne hill, win ne ther nnmeious or contro-
veited, on the cont-ary, the difference in the
Binds of S nHois upo 1 the meuts of the claims
wou'd lesult fiom a difference of conclusion from
the s me adm tted facts, and not fiom any con-
trovelsy abou' the facts themselves
What was the pioposmon, by the establish-
ment ot wl eh tie advocates of the bill sought to
enfoiee upon the Sen\te the piopnety of its pas
s 0 ' If 1 e undtistood it, it was this that
Bnno , on the 30th oí Septembei, 1S00, was 111-
d bted to citizens of the United States, (the
elaiman s ) at 1 as t five millions of dollars That
the United Sta'es were at the same time under
tieatystipil tions to Fi nice, oneious to them,
and \aluable to franco, and that the United
States, havug cl aigc ot the cla ms of their citi-
zens, released ti ese claims to Trance m consuler-
a ion of a íelease of then own treaty stipulations
to that nation llene e it was contended that the
Uiined States arc luble to then own citizens for
then claims on Fiance, upon the same pnnciple
th it an agent is liable to his principal if he ap-
piopriate the effects of the latter to his own use.
