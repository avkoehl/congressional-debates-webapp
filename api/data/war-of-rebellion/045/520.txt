CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 4, 1863.

Corps commanders will report the present position of the troops under their command in their immediate front, location, &c., amount of supplies on hand, and condition.

The intention of the major-general commanding is not to make any present move, but to refit and rest for to-day. The opportunity must be made use of to get the commands well in hand, and ready for such duties as the general may direct. The lines as held are not to be changed without orders, the skirmishers being simply advanced, according to instructions given, to find and report the position and lines of the enemy.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Gettysburg, Pa., July 4, 1863-8. 10 p. m.

General M. C. MEIGS,Quartermaster-General, Washington:

The enemy has been defeated and has retreated to the mountain passes, and will probably flee rapidly across the Potomac. We have about 12, 000 wounded, I think, though not known yet. The enemy's wounded lie on the field still. The battle was a long and most desperate one.

I trust now that the Army of the Potomac may be regarded as capable of fighting. Our supplies are coming up. We marched and fought this battle without baggage or wagons.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General.
