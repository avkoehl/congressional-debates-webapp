when the immense g<un% which are non d v ised by
confounding them, shall come m aid of produc-
tion
Whatever other changes the eiedit system is des-
tined to undergo, these are certainly some which
it must, but when and how the revolution will
end—whether it is destined to be sudden and con-
vulsive, or gradual and free from shock, t me alone
can disclose Mxich will depend on the decision of
the present question, and the comse which the advo-
cates of the system will pursue If the separation
takes place, and is acquiesced in by those interested
in the system, the prospect will be, that it will gra-
dually and quietly run down, without shock or
convulsion's, which is mv sincere prayer, but if not
—if the reverse shall be insisted on, and, above all,
if it should be effected through a great political
struggle, (it canonl) be so effected,) the revolution
we nld be violent and convulsn e A. great and
thorough change must take place It is wholly
unavoidab'e The public attention begins to be
roused throughout the civibzed world to tin  all
absorbing subject Theie is nothing left to be con
trolled but the mode and manne1", ard it is better
fit all that it should be gradual and quiet than the
reverse    All the rest is destiny
I ha\e now, Mr President, slid what I intended
without resei ve 01 disguise In taking tne stand 1
have, I change no relation, person il nor pditical,
nor alteran] opinion I have heretolure expiessed
or en tei tamed I desne nothing fro u the Govern-
ment or the peop'c My only ambition is to do
my duty, and "shall follow wherever tint may
lead, íegardlessalike of attachments oí inti¡ath¡es,
personal or poliucal I know full w 11 the respon-
sibility I have assumed I see cleaily tnc magni-
tude and the hazard of the crisis, and the danger of
confiding tne execution rf n casmes m which I
take so deep a responsibility, to these in whcml
have no reason to hive "in special coi fidenee
But all this deters me not, when I believe that the
permanent interest of the couniiy isinvo'ved My
course is fixed I go forward If the administra-
tion recommend what I approve on this great que-,
tion, 1 will cheerfully give my support, if not, T
shall oppose, but, in opposing, I ohall feel bound
to suggest what I believe to be the proper measure,
and which I shall be ready to back, be the respon-
sibility what it mav, looking only to the counüy,
and not stopping to estimate w hether the benefit

SPEECH OF MR. &IIOLSON,
Oj Mississippi,
In the House of R'^iesentatnes, October 8, 1837—Ol
the proposition of Mr UxDeitwooD to amend t íe
bill leported by the Committee o  Wa\s and
Means, to authrnze the Piesident of" 'he United
Stales to issac ^10,000,000 in Pieasury no es, sj

three monlhs then the Titasury notes, to the

pout 1 in the bill
Mr   GHOLSON took the  fit or, and addre sed
the Hoi se subst tntialh is follow «
Mr Spü \kfr If, by remaining in my seat, I be-
lieved the v Oie on the amendme it pioposed by the
gentlitnan from ICtnt icky, (Mi Undent oo 1,) or
on the b li itself, \u lid b  taken at an earl er pe-
riod I stuety would content myself vv th gn ing "
sUen* volt, however anxious 1 m ly be, or may
have been to express my views I am in bad
health, « i oow i with pitvious labor, and find
myself but illy calcula c i for the effort of debite
The course of tne wh e t i- door, ever since the
commencement oí the scssio has assjud ne that
their object is, an 1 Ins been, that this Hou e shall
not act on any b 11 hkety to ie' eve the embairass-
ments ot tbe country-
Sir, I am justified in saying tint ft object of
the whigs is, and has been, to keep up excitement
m the countrv, and add embarrassment to the
already embarrassed condi'ion of t^e Governmeni
and the people When this session first commenced,
ne were told by the gertleman from Tennessee,
(Mr Bell,) and the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr
Wise,) who are regarded by me and by the coun-
try as the oracles of the whig party, that they had
no measures of their own to bring foi vard to
relieve the Union The gentleman from Virgima
went further He requested or directed his 'vhtg
allies to bring forward no measure to relieve the
countrv He said that, for one, he would let the
country groan on, that it was not the intention of
the administration party here to carry out tha
recommendations of the President, and even nent
so far as warn mv friend from South Carolina
(Mr Pickens) to be on his guard, lest he wete
arrested and <;hot as a deserter Being hew haid
pressed in this quarter, and this bill (vvhich has
been so bitierly denounced) being likely to be
finally voted o i before the close of the session, he
nils m the aid ot h s ally trom Tennessee, (Mr
Bell,) and solicits that gentleman to aid him m
occupying the time of the House with fruitless
discussion and vapid denuncation until the close
of this extraordinary session, and thus prevent
what is so much dreaded b both gen'lemen—that
relief which the country so imperiously demanls,
and which, if we possess the powei, we are bound
to afford to it
Well, sir, the gentleman fiom Tennessee has not
been unmindful of the appeal of the gentleman
from Vnsmia He has promptly obeyed the man-
date, and has gone to bis aid, and with the skill and
manpgementof a political grimalkin, he con«nm"d
the whole of Saturday in discussing a motion that
he never intended should be voted on, and after a
day and a part of the night had been consumed bv
descanting on that time killing motion, the gentle-
man from Ohio (Mr Whittle ey) came forward,
and aske 1 tht «eml>mn from Tennessee to v ith-
drew his metion Tne request wis instantly com-
plied with, thus conclusively proving, to my mind,
tha' the whole desisn and object of the gentleman
was, and is, confusion, excitement, embarrassment,
not aelion or relief to the Government or the peo-
pie
Sir, we have now progressed on this legislative
journey till we have reached the last week of the
session And what, Mr Speaker, let me ask, have
we, the administration party, been permitted to do1
By our untiring exertions we have got one little bill
through the Hoi sc1 The suffering p"op!e have a
li'ht to know to whom this delay, this was'e of
time, of mtiiey, this trifling w th their riffhls and
interests, is to be a«ciibed Sir, thi<" remissness,
this flagrant injustice, and wanton dereliction of
duty, can not, and must not, be charged to the ad-
ministration parly, foi if the wh gs, as they avow,
have no projects or plans of relief of their own,
why have they lot permitted us to carry out those
plans of the administration, which we stand ready
to oecute1 Is it because the\ fear the country yvill
be relieved?
What, sir, s-ijd the gentleman from Tennessee,
(Mi Bell) when he came forw m, on ^atu^dav
w itb nis time killn g project' He said he had told
the people, "the dear people,"just before the elec-
tion—at a time when he undoubtedly cheii lied a
v ery >/ ai m and tender feelm" < f itgard for the peo-
ple—that n would be in the powei of the adminis-
tration to relieve th  co miry in si\ y days at fur-
the.t' Well sir, why dies not the gentleman
bring lorw-rd the plan that hesuegested to his con-
st talents'! Is ho not bound to do so, ! c believes
what he has sa d m re ation to the nH"s set forth
in the Presiden 's Message1? Sureh he is When
he underiakps to su tiat th° se1 "mes suggested in
the Pres den's 'VTessafe Te wi'd and visonary,
and impracticable have we net a right to exnect
fiom him some plan that vv ill according to his ovv n
y tews, affoid relief practicable relief—a plan that
is in itself piacticable and re-sonable? What was
the vast and wonderful scheme nat the ho íorable
centleman suggested to the people of his district''
He says 'hat it w is a scheme to fore the Govern-
ment to take up the §100,000,000 of irredeemable
bank papei now afloat in the country '   Indeed, sir'
Mr   Speaker, common sense,  the commonest
' easomng, and the teachings of every day's expe-
rience and observation, all go to prov e the utter
impracticability of the proposition I have too
high a regard for the gentleman's intelligence to
believe, for a single moment, that he believes m. the
practicability of any such project Those banks
which have flooded the country with a redundant pa-
per circulation have failed, and their paper become
worthless in the hands of the people, at the very
time when they were sustained by all the resources
of this mighty and munificent Government 'daily
poured into their vaults They failed, sir, when
they were sustained, not only by the Government,
but by the confidence of the whole American peo-
ple, and by that still stionger power, public opi-
nion If they failed under the existence cf such
pi ops and such patronage—if they could not exist
as organic bodies, and perform the functions re-
quired of them by law and by then charters, under
fe existence of circumstances so favorable—and
if their paper, as we all know tobe the fact, has de-
preciated fifteen p°r cent how much mere signal
and complete must be their failure, when they do
not and can not obtain the confidence of the people'
Sir, I defy the Government to give the people
confidence in these banking ins ltutions They
have already failed, and without the confidence of
the people, they can not be resuscitated, they can not
snsta n themselves
Mr Sp al er, who, let me inquire, ever heard of
a Government like ours, m a time of pro/ound
peace, dealing in paper known to be depreciated,
and attempting to make that paper the circulating
medium of the country1 Do we not all know that
this plan is wild visionary, impracticable, and un-
heard rf> I know, sir, the gentleman fiom Ten-
nessee does not believe it practicable, if he did, he
vv ou'd bring it forward in a tangible shape I have
too much confidence in his ability as asutesmar,
too much confidence in his intelligence as a fimn-
eiei, to do him the injus ice of believing him at all
in fav or o   the plan of w hich he has spoken
The causes that have moved the gentleman from
Tennessee in this matter, are easily divined, nay,
they cannot be misunderstood He had said some-
thing on this subject to the people of his district, to
his constituency if you please, and he wished to con-
sume the time of this House, abov e all, he w ished
to aid the federal bank party m this House, and to
attain his ends, he came out with the plans on
which I have animadverted, and hoped to impose
on the country I say this, for this further reason,
that the whole course of t! e opposition, with whom
th" gentleman from Tennessee is acting, has been
directed to the single and sole purpose of prey entmg
any thing Lemg done by the administration to íe-
heve the country Then are influenced in their
course bv the belie' that if thev can keep up the
present excitement m the country, they can furce
from the recessities of the people the recharter of
the United States Bank, oi a national bank subser-
vient to their wishes They know that th s queun n
has been again and again submitted to the people,
and the PEOPLE, aftei calm del iteration and reflec-
tion, have dec ded that they 'mil not have a bank
But, not satisfied with the unqualified expression of
the people's voice, they still cling with tenacity to
the desperate hope, that has been made to tell its
" flattering tale," by the preser t unnatnril exa re-
ment and derangemert that new pervades every
section of the country They know that if the
ecuntry is relieved, and the rresent excitement ct i
be quelled, their hopes of a national b*nk will be
laid pro«traU And this is the reason, Mr Speaker,
this struggle has been so desperate this sir, is the
reasen that the crv of Executive Bank, has been
sounded through this hall, this is the re-son that
we have been so often boast ngly told, that unless
a national bank weie incorpor ,ted, the country
w ould be convulsed This is the true and r nly
reason thatexists for thecry wehaveso often heard,
that this bill will sap th° liberties of the count) y, that
by means of this Executix e bank,the President w ould
be enabled to place his foot on the necks of the
people This cry has been raised because sen tie-
men know that a bank is yet unpopular, and they
hope to prejudice the country against this bill be-
fore it passes, by calling it an Executive banlf bill.
Sir, they seek to frighten us by tellmgus mat when
