DECHERD, July 31, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Telegraph office opened this evening. Communication of the 28th from you, informing me that a cipher had been sent to me the previous day, has been received, but the communication with the cipher has not been received. Some convalescents belonging to General Thomas' division have arrived here. My shortness cavalry force prevents me exploring for information as much as I would like. What I have are to be chiefly employed to gather forage. I would be glad to have more cavalry.
