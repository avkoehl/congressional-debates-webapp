FORT MONROE, March 19, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

The two divisions at Newport News have been ordered out of the department. Getty's remains with you. New Berne has been feebly attacked. The rebels have retired.*

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

March 19, 1863-5.10 p. m.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE, Commanding:

One brigade of Willcox's division is embarked and part of the second; also a battery of artillery; but it is not proper that they should start. A severe snow-storm set in this morning and still continues, and as the steamers will have to wait until it is over I have ordered the embarkation to be postponed. Shall the ammunition and ambulance train of the First Division follow the division, or wait until the Second Division is embarked? General Smith is still absent. The chief quartermaster has not yet reported for duty; went west with General Burns. Captain Van Ness, acting, absent on leave. Dr. Mcdonald is absent with leave; all others present. Bowen, Coale, and Chambloss were assigned to the Ninth Corps, and Babcock to the Sixth, by orders from the War Department of March 1. It appears that these assignments are ordered by the President. Should not therefore those remain that are assigned to the Ninth Corps? The following list of officers composing the staff of the Ninth Corps was furnished me by Colonel Bowen, assistant adjutant-general: Lieutenant Colonel N. Bowen, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Colonel O. E. Babcock, assistant inspector-general; Lieutenant Colonel John H. Coale, chief commissary; Colonel Chambliss, chief quartermaster; Dr. P. A. O'Connell, acting medical director; Dr. J. E. McDonald, medical inspector; First Lieutenant O. M. Dearborn, ordnance officer; First Lieutenant S. N. Benjamin, acting chief of artillery; Captain T. B. Marsh, chief of ambulance corps.

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

March 20, 1863-12 noon.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE:

The storm will continues and it is impossible to do anything. The transports cannot leave on account of the storm. As soon as it subsides I will start the transports and continue the embarkation. The men now on board are of course consuming rations, and provision should be made to replenish their stock in Baltimore.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
