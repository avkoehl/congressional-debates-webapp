GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 265. Washington, October 1, 1864.

REGULATIONS IN RESPECT TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTION TICKETS AND PROXIES IN THE ARMY.

In order to secure a fair distribution of tickets among soldiers in the field who, by the laws of their respective States, are entitled to vote at the approaching elections, the following rules and regulations are prescribed:

First. One agent for each army corps may be designated by the State Executive, or by the State committee of each political party, who, on presenting his credentials from the State Executive, or from the chairman of said committee, shall receive from this Department a pass to the headquarters of the corps for which he is designated, with tickets (or proxies, when required by State laws), which may be placed by him in the hands of such person, or persons, as he may select, for distribution among officers and soldiers.

Second. Civilian inspectors of each political party, not to exceed one for every brigade, may in like manner be designated, who shall receive passes, on application to the Adjutant-General, to be present on the day of election to see that the elections are fairly conducted.

Third. No political speeches, harangues, or canvassing among the troops will be permitted.

Fourth. Commanding officers are enjoined to take such measures as may be essential to secure freedom and fairness in the elections, and that they be conducted with due regard to good order and military discipline.
