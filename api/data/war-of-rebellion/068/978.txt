RICHMOND, May 9, 1864-11.10 a.m.

General G. E. PICKETT:

Push forward all the troops as fast as they arrive to recover the position lost and reopen the road telegraph to this point. Should the enemy move, as is now reported, on Drewry's Bluff, we must assail him in rear from Port Walthall Junction. Major-General Hoke on his arrival is to command north of the Appomattox.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

MAY 9, 1864-10.30 a.m.

General JOHNSON:

I would not bring on a general engagement if possible to avoid it. No troops additional can possibly reach here before 3 p.m. to-day, and they will only be one regiment of Wise's brigade, some 500 strong. Hoke and Ransom have passed Weldon. I have sent a regiment toward Broadway with some artillery. Hope to do the enemy some damage. Let me know what is going on.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General, Commanding.
