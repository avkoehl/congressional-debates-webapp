WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 23, 1862.

Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

It is the anxious desire of the Department to give the new regiments the advantage of experienced officers of their own choice. I hope you understand that any delay or refusal arisen from absolute military necessity. The regiments in the field and in the face of the enemy cannot safely or justly be deprived of their officers while in that condition. When relieved from it the Department will be disposed to sanction the appointments desired.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

DAVENPORT, IOWA, August 23, 1862-10.30 p. m.

(Received 2.15 a. m. 24th.)

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

Commissions to commissioners, surgeons, and enrolling officers were sent to each county on the 18th by mail. Enrollments are going on in many counties, but by reason of the infrequency of the mails many counties will not be ready for draft on the 3rd of September. I have directed all commissioners to be present at the place of drafting on the 3rd, and if not ready to continue from day to day until ready. Recognize if proper and, if you can, extend the time in this State for filling old regiments to September 10, and from commencement of drafting to September 15. This will suit much better. We have few railroads and telegraphs.

SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 23, 1862-8 a. m.

(Received 11.20 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

We will have at least seventeen additional regiments ready for their arms by this time next week. Cannot the arms be sent immediately?

I am pushing forward organization and muster.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 23, 1862-8 a. m.

(Received 11.25 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War;

We have six regiments forming, but incomplete, which can be fully organized by 1st of September, if recruiting is allowed to go on with advance pay and bounty.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.
