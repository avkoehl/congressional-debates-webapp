THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 13,
kots wholly through foreign waters and in English
bottoms, andthcro eomo in competition with our own
products exported from New York and otiier United
Stntes ports.
Beiiiic favorably situated .it this point, where the
great bulk of the importations of these grains are
miide, v?e have no hesitation in saying that were the
duties on them reduced as above suegested a very
large addition to the revenue would be realized,
while, at the same time our canals and railroads
would have the benefit arising from their transport-
ation. We would therefore respectfully but earn-
estly urfto upon your committee the necessity of
establishing in the present bill the duty on wheat
and rye at 10 cents per bushel.
The Board of Trade of the city of Oswego is
composed of gentlemen who represent, I ven-
ture to say, a larger manufacture of flour and
consumption of Indian corn than the entire
district of the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Schenck.] There is no district in the United
States the production .of flour in which ex-
ceeds that in the district of the gentlemen who
compose the Board of Trade of the city of
Oswego. But as regards this amendment it
does not afford and cannot afford any protec-
tion whatever to the agricultural interests of
the country, for the simple reason that the
amount of corn meal we import is entirely in-
significant. We imported into this country
during the year 1867 from Canada, which is
the only country from which we import any
corn meal, $80 worth. That was the entire
importation of the year. In 1868 we imported
$97 worth. In the year 1869 the importation
■was $519 worth. In other words, we imported
less than $700 worth during these three years.
Mr. ALLISON. May I ask the gentleman
a question ?
Mr. CHURCHILL. Certainly.
Mr. ALLISON. I should like to know how
much we exported to Canada during these
years, in order to gee whether the people in
Canada, by retaliation, might not injure our
producers.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I have the figures
before me and will state them. In the year
"J1867 the Canadians purchased from our form-
ers 2,228,590 bushels of corn, 2,034,710 bushels
in 1868, and 2,168,144 bushels in the year 1869.
And during the same time, in addition to this
corn, they also purchased from us 109,387 bar-
rels of corn meal in 1867, 154,923 barrels in
1868, and 126,218 barrels in 1869.
Therefore, if for the purpose of protecting
ourselves against this enormous importation of
$700 worth of corn meal in three years we put
up the duty to a rate which will be certainly
40 per cent, on the cost in Canada, we thereby
simply invite the Canadians to place retalia-
tory duties upon the very large quantity of
corn and corn meal which they purchase from
us. I desire to submit, as a part of my re-
marks, a table which shows that in the matter
of breadstuffa the Canadians are the very best
customers of the farmers of the United States;
that while we purchase from them considerable
quantities of wheat and barley they purchase
trom us every year a very considerably greater
quantity than we do from them. They have
heretofore, notwithstanding the duties, the
somewhat heavy duties, which we have im-
posed on their agricultural products, permitted
until the presentyear our agricultural products
to enter their territory entirely free of duty.
This year, it is true, they have imposed a small
duty upon our grains and flour. But instead
of placing a duty of $2 a barrel upon flour,
which will be the rate as the tariff is now
amended, or proposed to be amended by the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, they put only 25 cents a barrel upon
wheat and rye flour, and 15 centsa barrel upon
all other meals of grain, and upon the grain
itself they place a duty of only 4 cents on wheat,
and 3 cents on all other grains. This is but
a very small proportion of the duty which we
charge upon their agricultural products. My
objection, then, to the amendment is that it
imposes an excessive tariff by putting on corn
meal and rye flour, which cost no more than
barreTftttlie CRnadiHrnnrarketsj a duty
of 1 cent per pound. The table I submit is as
follows :
Statement exhibiting the import  and export  of grain
and breadstuff's to and from Canada and British
IYorth American possessions during the fiscal years
ended June 30, lSf&, to 1869, inclusive.

•Expiration of reciprocity treaty, March, 1866.
EDWARD YOUNG, in charge of Bxtreav,

Mr. SCHENCK. Beforethegen tleman frnm
New York [Mr. Churchill] closes there is a
point to which I desire to call his attention. I
wish to know whether he can explnin to us
how much of these articles which we export to
the British provinces goes to the Csmailas;
whether it does not go to what are called the
maritime provinces, which cannot retaliate—
Prince Edward's Island, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, and Newfoundland?
Mr. CHURCHILL. In reply to the gentle-
man I will say that a considerable proportion
of what we send to Canada unquestionably
goes to the eastern provinces. Corn and
wheat are very largely produced in Upper and
Lower Canada, but the wheat which they pro-
duce isalmostentirely of the high-priced kinds,
which they cannot afford to use themselves,
and they export it, selling it either in their
own markets or in England, and then purchase
for their own consumption the cheap wheat of
our western States. And the same is true of
corn. But with regard to these eastern prov-
inces the only question is as to whether we by
our policy will compel them to put such duties
upon their grains as will lead to their being
taken by the St. Lawrence river to the eastern
provinces, driving us out of that market and
supplying the market with their own produc-
tions.
Mr. CONGER. I move to amend the amend-
ment by striking out the last word. I suppose
no one at all familiar with this subject has any
question that the Canadians raise far more of
these products than they consume. They pur-
chase these products to ship, by the way of
Montreal and the St. Lawrence, to Europe and
the eastern provinces. It is also true that in
respect to every article which they cannot thus
use for their own exportation, in regard to
every article which they receive from the Uni-
ted States which comes at all in competition
with their own productions, their tariff is ex-
cessive and amounts almost to prohibition ;
whether it be for retaliation or for what pur-
pose is immaterial. In regard to all our manu-
factures—shoes, boots, wagons, and everything
that we produce that comes in competition
with Canadian labor—their tariff is almost pro-
hibitory. But in regard to those articles which
they may purchase and ship to Europe, or are
in the eastern provinces, their duties are light,
for their own advantage merely. If these duties
were removed these things would be brought
across all along the border. Large quantities
of oat meal are brought into the United States,
and have been for years past. Until within a
few years our own millers have not been in
the habit of grinding and preparing oat meal,
and it was shipped across the border. 1 have
seen car-load after car-load shipped to Cincin-
nati, St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and to
the South generally, through the port where I
live. The duty may be higher upon corn meal
than is necessary, but in regard to the other
articles the duties are not at all too high.
The question was taken on Mr. Schenck:s
amendment, and there were—ayes 51, noes 21;
no quorum voting.
Tellers were ordered; and Mr. Churchill
and Mr. Conger were appointed.
The committee divided; and the tellers
reported—ayes 76, noes 41.
So the amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SCHENCK. In order to remove a rep-
etition in the language, I ask unanimous con-
sent to move to amend the paragraph so that
it will read "on flour or meal of oats, wheat,
rye, corn, or buckwheat, 1 cent a pound."
By unanimous consent the amendment was
entertained and agreed to.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I offer the following
amendment to come in at the end of the para-
graph :
On middlings, shipstufis, shorts, and floor, or meal
of grains of any kind ground or mixed for feed. 20
per cent, ad valorem.
These are coarse products of the manufac-
tures of grain, wbidi now; I think? ttone in rft
