•THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ists. They arc essentially kindred spirits, though
sometimes seeming to differ. The leading fire-
eaters at the South are full of fury and fight; while
the leading political abolitionists, bitten by the
northern serpent, are seized with monomania, or
more properly negrophobia, a disease having some
analogy to hydrophobia. It is said the sufferer
from hydrophobia has an instinctive dread of
water, and can never pass over a stream without
convulsions and sometimes death; and so these
political subjects of negrophobia have an inde-
scribable dtead of election days, and can never
pass through one safely. Hence, on the mem-
orable 14th of October last, these men in Penn-
sylvania, and particularly in Ohio and Indiana, at
about the hour of twelve o'clock, were suddenly
seized with fearful trembling, spasms, and con-
vulsions, and a little after the polls were closed
their dead bodies were seen at all the corners of
the streets. And the same result occurred again
on the 4th of November in Illinois, in New Jer-
sey, and in New York. Theirs was a most dis-
tressing and melancholy fate, leaving nothing to
console their surviving friends, except that their
loss was the country's gain.
Mr. Chairman, abolitionism }ias now tempo-
rary control of the Government; it shapes its own
policy, has everything its own way, and is fast
working out its own destruction in the eyes of all
thinking men. It is doomed, and will certainly
fall beyond the reach of any political resurrection.
The danger is it may drag down the Government
with it. But if this Government shall escape ship-
wreck and ruin, the people will learn one salutary
lesson, dearly bought and not easily forgotten,
and that is, never to trust their Government and ,
liberty in the hands of a fanatical and sectional
party again. Sir, I have ever fell for our form of
Government the deepest devotion. As the mother
would bend over the couch of her dying child, and
hope for restoration while there was life and bieath,
so would I hope for and cling to this Govern-
ment. And yet I dcclare I have no hope, none
whatever, from the piesen-t radical policy, it never
can save the Government and restore the Union;
to my mind that is just as certain as if all were
now swallowed up and lost in anarchy and blood.
And yet I do not despair of the Government;
I am glad to believe there is still solid ground for
hope. I believe the Democratic hosts, in the
.North and Northwest, have the power to crush
and subdue the icbcllion North and South, and
save the Government fiom min; and, though al-
ways an old Whig, I am ready, and my constit-
uents arc ready, to unite heart and hand with the
Democratic pai ty in battling for the Union against
abolitionists and secessionists, now and forever.
I raise no objection to the name of that party.
Democracy is an old and bonoted name, and no
man need blush, to assume it. Their platform,
"the Constitution as it is and the Union as il was,"
has the nng of the pure metal. It is a close and
searching test of loyally, as I have mote than once
witnessed on thisllooi. Men who attempt to nd-
icule it never fail to betray theii own infidelity to
the Constitution. It is not possible for men who
are opposed to that platform to be truly loyal
We have no Constitution but the Constitution as
it is, and if you art' not for that, then yon <u<>, in
furling and sent muni t, in rebellion against it. W e
have no Union, never had nor can have, under
that Constitution but the Union as it was tunned
by n; audi? you ate not fm that* yuate a i^aniM
liie Union, and, of neccsbtly, disinnonis t , lienor

guise, i.s nothing butaw.u upon the Union and
against the Const ilution, because npiuieets sla-
very,;! nd there n nd i n that is fon in! t he h<\u t and coi e
of the pbol it am lebeliion : and it is not -nng but a
lubellion against the Government. Sir, what did
we hear fiom a p"oiiiinent leader of the luUieais,
t he gem leman ft om Pennsyl va ma, [Air. Steven s ,J

g'-niictnan also said he had heard this talk of re-
ivoimc tho felnion ne it was, under the Constitu-
tion ;is\r is, umil he had '' bccome about sick cf d.
Yes, sn, and no doubt there are others who tee!
,it,■ d.inie way. JeiVeison Davis once_ profes^-d
devotion to the Union, took many oaths to sup-
port the Constitution; bnt now, when he thinks
of the lestoration of the Union as it was, wider the
Constitution as it is, he is a tittle siek, slightly un-
well—that would not bea health-giving or life-sav-
ing operation to him.
Mr. Chairman, I have often heard it said the
real object of the abolitionists was a permanent
separation between the slave and free States; arid
to effect that, their policy is to press one extreme
measure after another, keep up a constant war on
the. border slave States and their representatives,
and by that means irritate, goad, and drive them
out of the Union. If that is their object, I believe
they will utterly fail. We don'tin tend to be driven
by one rebellion into another. And if anybody
has to go, we tell the abolitionists now to prepare
to start themselves. The world is wide; they can
depart in peace to Liberia or Hayti, or wherever
they choose. But, sit, this is our Government,
our bit thright, purchased for us with the blood of
our fathers. It was not made for abolitionists and
fire-eaters, and we do not intend to surrender it to
them. This is no rash or hasty resolution; we
have counted the cost.
Sir, we know the fearful perils that press upon
our beloved Kentucky from the South and fiom
the North; we know her spotless breast must pass
through a baptism of fire and blood; but we think
of the vast conservative hosts of the Noith and
Northwest, and take courage. "We believe they
will stand by us as long as we stand by the Con-
stitution, and will not suffer us to fall and perish
in such a struggle.
And though the fiery tide of southern revolu-
tion may break upon her 011 one side, and the
cold, n'y billows of abolition dash against heron
the other, yet will Kentucky, holding high in he'
hand the Constitution, and gazing with eyes of
fite on the stais and stnpis, ting out the battle-
cry ovet all her hills and valleys—" The Constitu-
tion as it is and the Union as it, was."

Mr. VALLAKDIGrHAM, I oiijec,Up;tha^r-

'The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has ft righi'f?
have the authority read. :•
The Clerk read the following from pa go 68 of
Barclay's Digest: ' \.-
" Wiiilu a member is occqpying tlio floor Ite may Jieidto
another lor explanutlon of the pending ineastire"? as' well as
for persona! explanation So. too, he may yield it for a mo-
tion to adjourn, or that the oomm'ttee rise, without fositig
it is right 10 it-occupy it for the remainder of bi&ltme when-
evet the pending mea> ne shall be resmmcd; but it is oth-
erwise when he vieldy to enable anotlieV Jo offer or with-
draw an amendment." " '
The negative vote was taken, when it appeared
that no quorum had voted—fifteen only voting ki
the negative.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair, on reflection,
decides that a motion that the committee rise,
takes precedence of the appeal.
The question was put; and it was decided in
the affirmative—ayes 29, noes none.
So the committee agreed to rise.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. No quorum has.
voted.
The CHAIRMAN. A quorum is not neces-
sary for that purpose.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Lovejoy hav-
ing taken the chair as Speaker pra tempore, Mr.
Pike leported that the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union had, according to order,
had the Union generally under consideration, and
particularly a joint resolution of the House (No.
30) to H^honze the Secretary of War to test Sand-
eison'rt breech-loading cannon, and had come to
no conclusion thereon.
