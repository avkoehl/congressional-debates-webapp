Lastly, the commanding general will recommend for promotion to the next higher grade the brigadier-general commanding division, colonel commanding brigade, and so down to all officer and soldier of the leading division, brigade, or regiment which first enters Richmond, and he doubts not that his recommendation will be approved by the lieutenant-general, and acted upon by the President, and if Richmond is taken he will pledge to the division, brigade, or regiment first entering the city, to each officer and man six months' extra pay. While making this offer so general to officers and men, the commanding general desires to say that he has not included the major-generals commanding corps because he knows of no incentive which could cause them to do their duty with more promptness and efficiency than they will do it.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES, September 28, 1864.

Major-General ORD,Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

You will make arrangements for holding your line between the Appomattox and the James with the Provisional Brigade. I have taken from it only two battalions, which you report unfit for field duty, and shall add a regiment to your moving column instead. You can move them at such time during the day, and supply their place, in such manner as you see fit, with your Provisional Brigade and such other troops as you may deem necessary. You can move them at any time during the day. Their exhibition on your line can do you no harm; indeed, a little parade of them might aid.

Of course, you will be use your discretion as to what troops you will leave behind that you think are not fit for service. The two regiments at Pocahontas and Harrison's Landing will be with you in the course of the day. General Birney will have a new regiment, which he will probably leave in your works.

You will send with the utmost possible dispatch the two colored regiments to Deep Bottom to report to General Paine. They will not stop
