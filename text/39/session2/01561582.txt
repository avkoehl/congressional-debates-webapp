The foregoing is a correct statement of the average
wages paul to hired men at the Washington arsenal
uuriiu? the period stated. The regulations of the
ordnance department require commanding ofiicers
ot arsenals to pay to their employes the same wages
that similar services command at private establish-
ments in the vicinity.

Now, it should be remembered that the per-
sons whose pay is increased by this resolution
are receiving salaries fixed by law years ago,
and they have suffered the increased burdens
in the prices of all the necessaries of life with
no corresponding change in their pay. I hope
no one will propose to increase the amount of
expenditure provided in this resolution.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I desire to ask
■whether this increase 
Mr. THAYER. I object to debate.
The amendment was agreed to.
^r' GARFIELD moved to reconsider the
votes by which the several amendments recom-
mended by the committee were agreed to; and
also moved to lay the motion to reconsider on
the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. STE\ ENS. I move to suspend the
rules, so as to postpone the morning hour
until after the fortification bill has been dis-
posed of.
The question was taken; and (two thirds
voting in favor thereof) .Mr. Stevens's motion
was agreed to.
fortific \tion appropriation bill.
Mr. STEVEXS. I move that the rules be
suspended, and that the House resolve itself
into the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union on the special order.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended, and the House
accordingly resolved itself into the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr.
Donnelly in the chair,) and resumed the con-
sideration of House bill No. 1184, making
appropriations for the construction, preserva-
tion, and repairs of certain fortifications and
other works of defense for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 18G8.
The CHAIRMAN stated that when the com-
mittee last rose the following clause, beginning
at line five, on page 3, was under consideration:
For survey of the northern and northwestern lakes,
8155,000.
Mr. PAINE. I wish to know how it happens
that that item comes up for consideration again
this morning?
The CHAIRMAN. This is the clause that
was under consideration when the committee
last rose.
Mr. PAINE. I do not propose to debate it,
but I rise to a point of order. I do not know
that I understand exactly the nature of these
proceedings, but in reference to this appro-
priation for the survey of the northern and
northwestern lakes I do know that it was con-
sidered at the last session of the committee,
that tellers were ordered upon it, and that it
was passed by the House; so that I do not see
how it can again come up at this time.
The CHAIRMAN. No debate is in order.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I offer the following
amendment, to come in at the end of line fifty-
two:
To enable the Commander-in-Chief of tho Army
and Navy of the United State3 to fire a grand salute
of one hundred guns in honor of the victory of
Georgetown, SI,000, and moro if necessary. [Laugh-
ter.]
The CHAIRMAN. This section of the bill
was under discussion, and an amendment was
pending at the time the committee rose. The
amendment of the gentleman from Missouri
[Mr. Benjamin] is not in order.
Mr. NIBLACK. I would ask the gentle-
man from Missouri, [Mr. Benjamin,] if he
intends to be witty or only sarcastic ? We do
not understand on this side of the House.
The CHAIRMAN. No debate is in order.
Mr. HALE. I move to amend by inserting
after line fifty-two, the following:
For Fort Montgomery, at the outlet of Lake
Champlam, $25,000.
I think this amendment will receive the assent
of the Committee on Appropriations, and I trust
it will be adopted. This point is the most im-
portant point on our northern frontier. The
route by way of the Hudson river and Lake
Champlain through the eastern section of the
State of New York is known to every gentle-
man as having been the great highway of all
contests between the power in possession of
the Canadas and the power in possession of
this country from the time of the earliest Indian
wars down to the last Fenian raid. And this
fort is deemed by the War Department as one
of great importance. The appropriation I ask
for is a very small one, and I certainly hope my
amendment will be adopted.
Mr. ROSS. I have no doubt that the amend-
ment proposed by the gentleman from New
lork [Mr. Hale] is as proper as many of the
other items in the bill. And I suppose about
the same kind of an estimate has been made
for this appropriation as for the others.
I notice that there are in the bill some six-
teen items of appropriations for repairs of
forts at the rate of $50,000 each. Now, it
seems to me that it would be only proper for
the Committee on Appropriations to present
the estimates of some person who has exam-
ined this subject, so as to show what is the
difficulty with these forts. It should be shown
whether the foundations are giving wav, whether
the roofs are falling in, or the floors are decay- j
ing, so that we may be able to determine with
accuracy what amount of appropriations are I
pecessary to put the improvements upon these
forts which they need.
Mr. HALE. Will the gentleman allow me
a word of explanation of the point which he is
now discussing?
Mr. ROSS. Not at present. It appears to
me that we are acting entirely in the dark, and
that we need light upon the subject. There
should be an estimate by an architect, or some
competent person, showing what repairs upon
these forts are necessary, so that we may act
advisedly and with some degree of intelligence
upon this subject.
The gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Kasson]
attempted last night to be a little sarcastical
upon this subject because we proposed to strike
out these appropriations. For one, I am not
, disposed to run longer in this old rut in which
we have been running so long, appropriating
hundreds of thousands and even millions of dol-
lars every year to keep up these forts. Although
we have been making these appropriations an-
nually for the lost fifty years, not one of these
forts has ever been fired at during that time
except by ourselves; and we have lost thou-
sands of men at least by reason of having
these fortifications upon our coasts. And you
i may go on for fifty years longer making appro-
; priations and taxing the resources of the coun-
j try for the purpose of keeping up these forts;
and I will'Venture the prediction that there will
not be a gun fired at tnem during all that time.
Now, I want to get out of this old rut; there
! is no necessity whatever for our continuing in
it longer. I think the gentleman from Iowa
[Mr. Kasson] mistakes the views of his own
constituency upon this subject. They cer-
tainly have no desire to continue this squan-
dering of money upon the sea-board. If I am
not mistaken in the antecedents of my young
and able friend from Iowa, [Mr. Kasson,]
who by his intelligence and the cogency of his
logic always commands the indulgence and
attention of the House, it has been but very
recently that he has been ruthlessly torn from
the breast of his New England mother; and
he has hardly cut loose from the apron-strings
of New England. The time has come when
the great Northwest should make her voice
heard in regard to these extraordinary expend-
itures upon the sea-coast. And I trust that
my distinguished young friend, after he has
breathed the pure air of the West a few years
longer, will imbibe the true sentiments of that
section of the country which he is so capable
of representing efficiently and faithfully upon
this floor.
Now, Mr. Chairman, for my part, I desire
that we shall cease all these unnecessary ex-
penditures. Why should we persist in them ?
These appropriations have been of no benefit
to us in the past, and there is no reasonable
prospect that they will be in the future. Our
people are already heavily burdened with ex-
traordinary taxation; and we may at length put
the last feather npon the camel's back and
break it. It is time that we should cease these
unnecessary expenditures.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is exhausted
upon the pending amendment.
Mr. KASSON. I move pro formd to amend
the amendment by striking out 825,000 and
inserting $24,000. I wish to reply to my
excellent and venerable friend from Illinois
[Mr. Ross] by referring him to the title of this
bill, by which he will find that these appro-
priations are not for the purpose of making
repairs alone, but '■ for the construction, pres-
ervation, and repairs of certain fortifications
and other works of defense." In some cases
it is_ necessary, in order even to preserve the>e
fortifications in proper condition, to go on
with the work of construction to a certain
point, just as in constructing a house, as the
gentleman knows, ir is frequently necessarv.
in order to preserve unfinished walls, that they
shall be carried to a certain point where they
can be protected bv roofing or some other
means known to architecture. Thus in the
case of these forts, it is necessary to go on with
