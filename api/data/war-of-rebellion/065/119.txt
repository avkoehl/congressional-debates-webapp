HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. C., GA., AND FLA., Charleston, May 16, 1864.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 18, 1864.

I think it proper, in view of the orders received last night, to inform you, and request you to inform the President, that the bombardment of Fort Sumter and this city has been recently resumed with renewed vigor, both by land and naval batteries. We have damaged their monitors, and I think seriously crippled two of them. A new admiral arrived this morning, and I presume they will renew their efforts to gain possession of the harbor. I am sure we can keep them off if we only keep the batteries manned and supported. The orders received last night will leave half the batteries on Sullivan's Island unmanned and all on Sullivan's and James Islands and Sumter unsupported.

If it can possibly be done, with due regard to the general interest of the cause, I beg that I may retain troops absolutely necessary of until I can make other arrangements, which I can do in a few days. The Twelfth Georgia Battalion started this morning; the Eighteenth starts to-night.

SAM. JONES,Major-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General Finegan, with two battalions (600 strong) of his brigade, left here to-day about 12 o'clock for Richmond. The enemy has renewed his demonstration on James Island, and is firing rapidly now. I shall retain the Twentieth Regiment until to-morrow. It is very important that I should have a few more troops. Can I get any?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.
