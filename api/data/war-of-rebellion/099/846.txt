A. M. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,East side of Cape Fear River, near the Pontoon Crossing, March 15, 1865.

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I respectfully report that while my troops have to-day remained in camp at the point as designated in my report of lastnight, I have been busily engaged in getting the balance of my train over the pontoon, as my column was cut last night while crossing by General Kilpatrick's cavalry, and I was unable to get the bridge again until to-day. The crossing at this side was very difficult owing to the very steep bank. I managed, however, to get everything across by 4. 30 this p. m. Under the direction of Captain Henry, provost-marshal for the division this evening.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near South River, N. C., March 15, 1865.

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that this command marched at 11 a. m. to-day on the Goldsborough road, and camped at Bethany Church, near South River, in rear of Fourth Division, having marched ten miles.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. HAZEN,

Major-General.
