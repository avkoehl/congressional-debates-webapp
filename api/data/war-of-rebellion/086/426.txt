LITTLE ROCK, November 4, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

GENERAL: Magruder is moving in this direction in force. Five thousand are reported to have been at Princeton yesterday, 6,000 at Arkadelphia, where they are fortifying, and 2,000 at Rockport. I have not heard from Monticello for several days. Negroes report Camden evacuated. McCray is reported at Searcy. A reconnoitering party has been sent to that point. Ritter's brigade of cavalry has just returned from the Saline, and they confirmed the reports of the enemy's advance. The rest of Geiger's brigade of cavalry, 1,600, with four 3-inch rifled guns, has been sent to Lewisburg to be ready for Price; 500 went with General Herron. With the Third Arkansas, about 3,000 cavalry can be concentrated at Lewisburg or Dardanelle. It is reported from Lewisburg that Price's command is broken up and that they will endeavor to cross the Arkansas between Lewisburg and Clarksville. This information is derived from country people. Magruder has received information of Price's defeat in Missouri. All the infantry that can be furnished with transportation for the necessary supplies will be put upon the march as soon as I can learn anything definite from Price. Nobody communicates with me from Missouri. Last newspaper 25th ultimo. Mower took off the best part of my transportation. An officer was sent for it. Mules are all we want. Colonel Greene, assistant quartermaster, promised to send them. This place and Devall's Bluff cannot be left without considerable force. If either of these places should fall into the hands of the enemy the Department of Arkansas would go up. There are no supplies of any sort in the country for the support of an army. We are obliged to have forage on an expedition. I have sent to General Reynolds for another brigade.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
