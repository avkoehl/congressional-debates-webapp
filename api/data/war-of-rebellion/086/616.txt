HEADQUARTERS NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS,Mouth of White River, November 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I forward papers* referring to trade on the Mississippi and its tributaries. It appeared to me that the actual state of affairs in this vicinity demanded that the communication to Major-General Halleck should be made.

Have not one word official from General Steele since the 11th, except an indorsement on a "cotton paper" of the 15th. Persons from Devall's Bluff and Little Rock represent everything quiet. I inclose copies of telegram from General Halleck to General Washburn, November 9+; also copy of letter from General Dana to me.++

Unless unexpected news from Arkansas should be received to-day, I will take steps immediately to send re-enforcements to General Washburn at Memphis, of which due reports will be made.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.
