HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 9, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I again find myself in the position I have been so often before, surrounded by starving women and children. They are unwilling to take the oath, as they do not know but it may be made a source of oppression to them by our enemies if we remove, and it hardly seems right to exact such a sacred thing from women under the pressure of craving hunger. I cannot see them starve, and have not the means to support them. Cannot I be authorized to issue rations to support those within our lines?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 9, 1864.

General G. K. WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Patrick says he will at once take the necessary measures to relieve the destitute women and children alluded to in your dispatch of this morning. Perhaps it would be best for you in such cases to refer the parties to the provost-marshal-general.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 9, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: It is hardly possible to send these distressed people to the provost-marshal-general. They are old and enfeebled or too young, and those that have any strength are absolutely required at home to take care of the sick and the babies. In spite of all we can do, our pillages keep these people in constant terror, and under threats of burning the houses ransack everything. It is distressing to listen to their stories, the evidence of whose truth is seen in every dwelling.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 9, 1864.

General G. K. WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

I did not mean to convey the idea that you were to send the destitute people to General Patrick. I only desire to suggest that it would perhaps save you inconvenience were you to refer their applications or make known their necessities to General Patrick.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
