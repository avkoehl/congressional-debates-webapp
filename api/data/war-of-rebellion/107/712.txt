HEADQUARTERS,Baltimore, June 30, 1862 - 2. 15 p. m.

Brigadier - General KELLEY, Cumberland:

I have always found it a losing game to detach small parties any distance from the main body of the troops, except as patrols, and these ought to be composed of cavalry well monted on strong and fast horses, and the men and officers should be selected from your best men. I think it more than probable, unless you have ordered them to Cumberland or some other station where the main body may be located, that the troops at Petersburg, as you suggested, may be captured. What was the object of stationing such small detachment at Moorefield and Petersburg? I present these remarks without intending to dictate or change what may have been considered proper by yourself or ordered by others. They are beyond my authority, and therefore you will consider this in no other light than suggestions for your consideration.
