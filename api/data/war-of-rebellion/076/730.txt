Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you hold a division of your command in readiness to make a reconnaissance in force this afternoon at 4 o'clock. The point to debouch from is near the brigade of your command already across the river. General Logan will make a strong demonstration along his entire front at the same hour. General Ransom will make a feint of moving to the right. The object of the reconnaissance is to obtain information of the position and strength of the enemy's forces, to ascertain whether his lines are continuous beyond our left, to occupy his attention while Generals Thomas and Schofield are endeavoring to get upon the railroad, and certainly get upon the railroad ourselves if able at any point. When General Blair is ready to debouch from the lines he will give a signal of six guns in quick succession from a battery this side of the river. The major-general commanding will be present on the left at the hour named.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. L. TAGGART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
