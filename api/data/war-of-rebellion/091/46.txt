HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Bunker Hill, September 7, 1864.

Colonel LOWELL,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: Colonel Powell, commanding the Second Brigade of this division, reports that an officer of this command sent to Smithfield yesterday found all the pickets asleep, together with the commanding officer of the day, and all at the reserve. General Avarell directs me to call your attention to this fact, as the negligence of these men endangers the left of this line.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILL RUMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Four miles from Winchester, on Millwood Pike,

September 7, 1864-9.45 a. m.

Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have crossed the Opequon with but little difficultly, meeting a pike force of about thirty men from the Sixth Virginia Cavalry. From different citizens I learn that a part of Early's infantry was encamped a mile and a half this side of Winchester; how much they didn't know. Another citizens says he was at Winchester Yesterday and found the same force at the same place. Fitz Lee's cavalry and some infantry moved up the Valley pike day before yesterday, fearing a Yank raid in that direction, but returned the same night to Winchester. My advance brigade (Chapman's) is skirmishing slightly with the enemy a mile or so beyond here. McIntosh is yet with the train, on the Millwood side of the stream. No sign of the enemy in any other direction than toward Winchester. People think that Early is slowly withdrawing with the intention of leaving the Valley, through they give no real evidence upon which to base such opinion.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Opequon Creek, on Millwood Road, September 7, 1864-11.35 a. m.

Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry:

The first orderly sent could not get through for guerrillas. General Chapman advanced to within two miles and a half of Winchester, when he encounter the enemy's infantry; what force could not ascertain, through quince a number of regiments. The people along the advance skirmish line could hear drums and bands this morning in and around Winchester. About one regiment of cavalry was seen. Having gone as far as I think prudent, I shall fall back to the Stone Chapel, and await further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
