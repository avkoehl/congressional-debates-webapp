HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864-8.10 p. m.

Major-General PARKE:

General Ord is directed to extend his left and relieve your corps of nearly one-half of the front it now occupies. The commanding general directs that you relieve the fifth Corps of the intrenchments it now occupies and hold the front from Ord's left to and including the large redoubt on the plank road and the batteries in that vicinity, if they are now held by the Ninth Corps. As the Fifth Corps will take with it all its field artillery, you will call on General Hunt, chief of artillery, for any additional field pieces you may require for the batteries vacated by the Fifth Corps. The commanding general desires that these changes be made as soon as practicable.
