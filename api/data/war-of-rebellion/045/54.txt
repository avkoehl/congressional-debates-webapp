WASHINGTON, June 10, 1863-11. 45 a. m.

Major General W. T. H. BROOKS,

Care of John McDonald Crossan, Esq., Monongahela House:

You will receive by mail an appointment of major-general. General Couch goes to Harrisburg, and has command of the Department of the Susquehanna. Intelligence received this evening of the enemy's design makes it certain that you cannot be too early or too busily at work, as Pittsburgh will certainly be the point aimed at by Stuart's raid, which may daily be expected. You should frankly inform the people of Pittsburgh that they must be at work.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
