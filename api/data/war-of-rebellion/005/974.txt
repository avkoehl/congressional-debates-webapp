HEADQUARTERS, Centreville, December 1, 1861.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:

SIR: I beg leave to suggest to the War Department the importance of taking immediate measures to keep up our military force during the continuance of the war.

Two occur to me: One to hold inducements to volunteers for one year to re-engage for the war; leave of absence would be the strongest inducement; the practicability of granting them in this army must depend, however, upon the enemy's course during the winter. The other to form camps in which volunteers for the war shall be instructed (without arms, if arms are not to be had) and accustomed to camp life and go through the course of camp diseases. Such of these men as cannot be armed will be prepared to take the arms of the volunteers who may be discharged int eh spring.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
HEADQUARTERS, Centreville, December 1, 1861.

Honorable J. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War:

SIR: Our correspondent in Washington asserts that the United States Government has a spy in the War Office. He does not know the name..

He says that an advance os to be made this week in great force; a large force to cross the Potomac below us. The country is in a condition which prevents maneuvering on our put-a great advance, therefore, to the enemy, who moves on the water.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
