Major-General BUTLER:

During my absence out on my lines some deserters were forwarded to you. I am told that one of them, from the Eighteenth Georgia, reports that Kershaw's division was to relieve the local defense troops in my front to-day. If Kershaw's division is as near as that, won't it be used against Terry to-day?
