HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Bull's Mills, December 29, 1864-7 a.m.

Brigadier General THOMAS J. WOOD,

Commanding Fourth Corps:

GENERAL: Your note of 8 p.m. 28th was received during the night. I agree with you that, unless General Thomas intends to leave us on the Tennessee, there is no occasion for us to go farther. I have ordered Croxton one day's march on the road to Waterloo, in anticipation of instructions to destroy the Bear Creek bridge, and have sent a staff officer to Florence to communicate with the gun-boats and transports. I shall remain in camp here to-day, where we can obtain forage, and where dispatches may reach us from General Thomas.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I will also remain here to await instructions from General Thomas. Please communicate to me the result of your staff officers' visit to Florence.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Lexington, Ala., December 29, 1864

Brevet Major-General WILSON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I have reliable information that there is a party of guerrillas, about 100 in number, near Wise's Mill, on Blue Water, about six miles west of here. This party is splendidly mounted and well armed. It is reported that they have some of the best horses in the country. There are two men who live near the mill who will act as guides to the locality of this band. Mr. Wise, at the mill, will tell where these two men can be found and who they are. I will send an infantry force out to the same place in the morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brevet Major-General WILSON:

GENERAL: I have read your dispatch of this p.m. to General Whipple with great satisfaction, and fully concur in your views. I have suggested similar views to General Thomas, though not so pointedly as you have done in your dispatch. If we are to take post on the Tennessee River at all, it certainly will be a great waste of material and labor
