mac, until yesterday it was broken at heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of which he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured. We need men to repair this breach, and have them not at hand. My dear general, I feel justified to rely very much on you. I believe you and the brave officer and men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth.

HALLECK'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 25, 1862-6 p. m.

I have asked for no re-enforcements, but only whether any were to be sent to me. If any were to be sent, I would wait for them; if not, I would venture an attack. We are now in immediate presence of the enemy, and the battle may occur at any moment. I have every confidence that we shall succeed, but dislike to run any risk, and therefore have waited to ascertain if any more troops can be hoped for. Permit me to remark that we are operating upon too many points. Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategical points of war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards. My army is daily improving in health and discipline.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Camp on Corinth Road, May 28, 1862.

Three strong reconnoitering columns advanced this morning on the right center and left, to feel the enemy and unmask his batteries. Enemy hotly contested his ground at each point, but was driven back with considerable loss. The column on the left encountered the strongest opposition. Our loss there 25 killed and wounded. The enemy left 30 dead on the field. Losses at other points not yet ascertained. Some 5 or 6 officers and a number of privates captured. The fighting will probably be renewed tomorrow morning at daybreak. The whole country is so thickly wooded that we are compelled to fell our way.

Major-General.

NEAR CORINTH, May 30, 1862.

General Pope's heavy batteries opened upon the enemy's intrenchments yesterday about 10 a. m. Soon drove the rebels from their advanced battery. Major General W. T. Sherman established another heavy battery yesterday afternoon within 1,000 yards of their works, and skirmishing parties advanced at daybreak this morning. Three of our divisions are already in the enemy's advance works, about three-quarters of a mile from Corinth, which is in flames. The enemy has fallen back of the Mobile Railroad.

H. W. HALLECK.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.
