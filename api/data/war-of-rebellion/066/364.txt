CHARLESTON, S. C., March 18, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Tallahassee, Fla.:

You are ordered by General Cooper to send to Virginia Rutledge's, Dunovant's, and Aiken's regiments, and five other companies, including Trenholm's (South Carolina) cavalry, and White's new regiment, and rest of Millen's companies, Georgia Cavalry, and in their place will receive First and Second Regiments South Carolina Cavalry, from Virginia. Can't you guess source of this raid on your cavalry?

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

General-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:

Please read my letters of January 25 and February 5 last,* to Adjutant-General, and obtain action thereon. If compliance with requests therein contained were denied, the interests of the country, my own self-respect, nay, a proper regard for my reputation, would require that I should ask to be relieved from the command of this military department.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT,In the Field, Camp Milton, East Fla., March 19, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Richmond, Va.:

Cavalry ordered to Virginia will be sent at once, although considered indispensable to guard country and railroad from Charleston to Savannah and to defend this military department. Scouts near Jacksonville report enemy's forces reinforced by 2,500 men on 16th and 17th instant.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., March 19, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Baldwin, Fla.:

I telegraphed you last night of orders received from Richmond of sweeping away four regiments and eight companies of cavalry from your department. It will be needless to apply, then, for delay of Millen's battalion. Some prominent Carolinians will interpose, but I doubt their success.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
