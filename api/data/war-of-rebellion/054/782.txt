consequence, and I really think the latter never would have fallen had not the former "caved in."

I write now confidentially to you, and say what I would to no one else. I don't profess to be a soldier, but I know how to play a good game of chess and can see the moves on the board as well as any one. The whole campaign of Banks has been a failure in Louisiana, and his disasters have been terrible, though kindly covered up by his reporters. He is, I am told, one of the best of the militia generals, and is a pleasant, agreeable gentleman, but I do not think he has the proper appreciation of what is required at certain points nor is he posted in the topography or hydrography of the country in which he is operating. He is entering Texas by three lines, when neither corps was able to meet separately the force in front of them, and were without means of making a junction. The First Corps, under General Dana, was defeated, and had to fall back on the gunboats at Morganza, which kept the rebels from cutting them off; the Second at Sabine Pass witnessed the demolition of wooden gunboats, and, like the French King, "marched back again;" and the Third is wandering around Grand Lake, in Louisiana, wondering why I don't send them tin-clads.

I would be glad to do so if any one could tell me how to get into the Atchafalaya, or through Bayou La Fourche into Plaquemine.

The bar at the mouth of the former is dry, and there is 2 feet of water only at the mouth of Bayou La Fourche. Now, I am coming to the gist of the matter, though you will think I have taken a round about way to do it. The rebels are making use of Red River, Black, and Washita, to supply themselves with provisions, ammunition, &amp;c., in Louisiana, and they have by these rivers been enabled to interrupt General Banks' communications. The smallest of our gunboats have not been able to get into Red River to stop this, but one of the gunboats sent a party of 20 men overland at Union Point, on the Mississippi, 25 miles above the mouth of Red River. At this point the Red River and Mississippi come within 3 miles of each other, as you will see by the sketch* I send you. At Point A the party of sailors found a steamer lying in the river. They drove the men below with musketry, and 12 of the sailors swam to her and captured her. A few minutes after another large boat came around the bend; the sailors concealed themselves and signaled the steamer to come alongside, when she was also captured. On these two steamers General Dick Taylor depended to transport his men in and about the Atchafalaya and bayous. Our men burned the steamers because they could not get them out of the river, but brought over 16 prisoners, one of whom was an aide of General Dick Taylor and a very communicative gentleman.

Now, this affair suggested to me the idea of fortifying Point A on the sketch and holding it with troops. It effectually blocks up Red River, which is almost, if not quite, within reach of our guns on the gunboats in the Mississippi. Three hundred men can hold the point against any number the rebels will be able to send there. Dick Taylor will be cut off, and have to march all the way back to Alexandria. You will see the importance of this by examining the maps; it will be a great relief and assistance to General Banks. I took the liberty of writing to General Crocker at Natchez, and General McPherson at Natchez, about this. I don't know whether they will agree with me.

I have written you rather a long letter, which, to a general in
