CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, Va., August 14, 1864.

COMMANDANT OF POST, Macon, Ga.:

Colonel Samuel J. Crooks, New York cavalry, a Federal prisoner under your charge, must reluctantly be placed in irons and held in close confinement in retaliation for similar treatment for some time practiced on Colonel August McDonald, captured by his command. Inform him of the cause.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CAMP SUMTER, Anderson, Ga., August 14, 1864.

Lieutenant R. S. HOPKINS, Camp Sumter:

SIR: You will proceed at once to Millen, Ga., the site of the new prison about to be erected. You will deliver to the officer in charge the letter of instructions and the copy of a telegram from the War Department giving him certain authority to proceed at once and procure the labor, &amp;c. You will advise with him, especially in reference to the procurement of labor. Act under his instructions and the orders you have from these headquarters. You will visit such counties as have become the homes of planters from Florida and Georgia, with their slaves, and in which you have reason to believe you can hire negroes. I desire to avoid impressment, but the work must be hurried to completion.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.
