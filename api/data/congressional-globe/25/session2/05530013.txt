banks, and a third pany advocating a Built of the
United States Wow uill the gent'eman from Mas-
sachusetts tell me which of these propositions is
oremost in the lace oí publ.c opinion? Will any
one compare ihe advocates for the State banks, in
point of number, with those of the system proposed
by the A Irmnistraaon'i Have the friends of a
national bank, so signally defeated, at Ihe last
session, again 'allied under the cry of victo-
ry'' Nothing con VI strengthen them but the de-
fection of the Conservatives Ask the Conser-
vative if he is fir a national bank in piefcrence to
the plan of the administration IJis ¡yiswer is in
the negative Have the National Bank party
aone ovei to tne Conservative^ The two banks
a c, from thtir natures, antagonist powers, and
c innot unite but in opposition to a thud power,
i Inch assails them both I am persuaded, Mr
Chanman, that, of the ihree schemes before the
peopie, thi i.cale preponderates decidedly in favor
of the sepai alion I thirk, theiefore, neither the
law nor the fact, arising from the argument drawn
fiom the influence of pub'ic opinion, sustains the
objection to the committee But, su, I come to con-
sider the charge of submission 11 Executive dicta-
tion Th s is a grave charge, sir, and requires ex-
ammatun The commitiee that could consent,
and the Executive that would attempt to dictate,
without the war-ant of the Constitution, would be
equally umi orthj the confidence of the House ansi
then ton The question is, whether, undei our
Const tution, the President has the power to ¡no-
pose laws to Congress' In consulting that mstru-
írrnl foi Ihe powers and duties "f the President, I
find tnese words "He shall, from time to time,
give t > tl e Congress inf una on <' the statp of f>e
U uon, ami lecommrnl 'o thev consalei rtt on such
measmei ¡a he thai' jtid°e necessaiy and expedient'"
It may seem remarkable that, by the English
Constitution, the proposing power is denied to the
King, whilst in ouis it is vested in the Presi-
dent But the reason is obvious, if we attend
to the diffe-enee between the power and influence
of the two Executives. In England, where the
Kmg lias poner to raise and support armies,
with a revenue equal to that of manv of the
nations of the earth, surrounded by the pomp and
lega'iaol a thone, the powot t> tecommend mea-
suies to Parliament might often be equivalent to <i
powei to pass them lit is, therefore, w isUv re-
stricted to a simple negative The American Pie-
sulenl, on the other 1 and, divested of the power to
laise a single soldiei without the consent of Con-
gress, and, even if he could, without any sustain-
nig power bui in his own pnvite fmlmw, liable to
impeachment by one branch of the Legislatuio, md
subject to tual, conviction-, and punishment b fore
the judicial tribunals, mav safety be trusted with
the poviT in question Sir it is, a mastei piece of

wh ch ¡e~-tucts t' is power to mere outlines, and pro-
hibits a sprcificed on oí the pieeise mpa utes which
the President "sh-dl 31 dge necessary ami expe-
dient1" I think not The pnver is general It
includes a I the pirticulais The power to recotr

ttspvts It is paijticu'ailv necessarv and piopci in
all schemes compi sed of many distinct paits Ge
neral desciiptwns will give ro adequale idea, but
¡inly seive to bewilder Specficahon—detail—is
not only consistent wi h, but m perfection of Ihe
ger>"~al power It is on'y the counsel of the Ex"-
<"Ut e in that precise foim in which Ton cannot
mtutake it—a form which imparts to all counsel it*-
chief value It is, therefore, m my opinion, no de-
parture frem the Constitution for a commiltee to
i-eeen e draughts of bills, particularly if complicated
sn tbe'r nature, upon such subjects as ire renm
mended by the President to Congress " as necessarv
and expedient"
I come now, sir, to consider the second resolu-
tion under debate, proposing to refer the conduct of
the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, n
ie-issumg the notes of the old bank, to the Com-
mittee on   the Judiciary     An honoi able member
from Ohio (Mr Bond) objects to  this resolution__
an attempt to mtnnge the jut iidichon of one of the
Stales (Pennsylvania,) b/ i (.viewing the. conduct oí
an institution charteted under hei authority Is it
so' The charter of Pennsilvama bear  date the
eighteen h of Peb'uary, 1836 It binds the bank
lo the redemption ot such bills or notes as they
shall issue Its ban ?mg privileges commence from
that díte, look to tne future, and have nothing to
do wit i the past It has no authority under the
charter, then, to re-issue the notes of Ihe old bank
as pen I of then cuculatwi It cannot be made lia-
ble for their redemption under the chatter of Penn-
sylvania, because Iho e bills are antecedent m dale
to the charter The foundation for their redemp-
tion must be sought in tne charter under which
they originally issued. The banking privileges of
that chiiter expned on the 3d day of March, 18!G
The ie issue must Ijp either by the old or the new
bank, or both, as pirtners in the tiansaction If
by the old batik, ¡I is cleaily conixni/ to law If
l>y the new, it it> unauthoi acd by the 1 iw of Penn-
sylvania If bv both, it is equally an infringement
of the charlei of 1816, without the color of State
authority for its protection The principal and the
agent become paiticeps crimims m tne transaction
But the question may arise, does the c rcu'ation by
ths new bank, of the notes of the old one, amount
to a ie-issue
I shall not deny that distinct coiporations may
circulate the h'Hs of each oiher ícqmred in the fair
and leguhl eonise of tnde Are the" distinct coi-
porations'? Is not lh> s-unc (ock liable fir the
redemption ol ihe c'lcu'^lio i oí N>fh, ill s rot

company of the Bank of the United States, vvilh

theie is a community of profit and loss between
the two institution*-

REMARKS OF MR. N1LES,
Op Covmtticui,
In the Senate,   Thursday, December 21, 1837—On
•   the motion to pos>p me the b 11 for suppressing
th   en dilation ol small notes m this District
Mr NILCS said, tl at he hoped the motion to
postpone the bill would not pievail At the late
extra session, the provisions of this bill, and those
of another bill, now on the table, for compelling
the banks oí the Distnct to redeem their notes,
were united m one, and the sections relating to the
banks were stricken out, against his own w ishes, as
he at that time thought n ihe duty of Congress not
only to íestram the cncnlation of the small and
spuuous hash, but to compel the banks of the
District, at some future day, to fulñl their obliga-
tion ^ to the pub'ic At lhat lime there seemed to
1 e a „ mral i"p i ie -. to si pp-o^s the shin plaster
curien \,i it is calo I, aid the lili lor that pur-
pose jiassed iwih great unanimity He was not a
little surpnsed, theiefore, to \utness at this time an
effoit to delay action on this subject, and prolong
th  existence of that nmsano, which afflicts not
only the people of the District, but all others who
have occasion to visit this metiopolis The two
bills seem to be considered as connected, and the
postponement of this, he piesumed, would be re-
garded as a reason for postponing the bill relating
to the District bank-., and what he had to say would
apply to the «    !    su'iji t
