Mr. VINTON here aslced whether the resoki- /

Mr. BURT. Prom Indiana. 80 much, then, ;
for the precedent of the ordinance of 1787 ' He
would not say what use hacl been made of that '
munificent donation of Virginia. He would not
stop to inquire whether it had keen the means of
annoying an institution which that State had ever I
esteemed to lie most valuable. But lie proceeded I1
to the next precedent in the history of the leoisla- i
ticm of the country. That, as might be anticipa-
ted, was the memorable Missouri compiomise. i|
1 he United States acquired from Spain a territory ''i
which comprised the States of Louisiana, Mis- ;|
sown, Arkansas, and Iowa; and a portion of the
territory northwest of Iowa, over which lie saw
a proposition had been submitted to organize a
Territoual government. That territory was very
nearly- large enough for a State. Now, that was !
the first foreign territory acquired by the United '
folates. He begged leave, for a moment, to advert I
to the history of that acquisition of territory; and ^
if gentlemen would trouble themselves to investi- i
gate that history, they would find that the acciuisi- i
tion was demanded by (he West. They would ■
find that there was great excitement m the West i
in regard to the navigation of the Mississippi. Th-e j
opening of the navigation of that great river to the 1
commerce of the YTest was the motive for the acqmsi-
tion. He had not been able to discover that slavery
tiaa formed any inducement to the acquisition of
the territory. He ventured to say that that did not
enter at all into the motives winch led to that ac-
quisition. It was, in fact, a concession to the i
West, as tending1 to open the navigation of that 1
magnificent stream, the Mississippi. Annoying
and vexations restrictions nn the navigation of that
river had been imposed by Spain whilst the terri-
tory belonged to that kingdom. Now, after that
glance at the history of the acquisition of the ter- !
ritory, Jet them inquire what were the conditions !
of that compromise, known as the "Missouri com- i
promise." In the eighth section of the act of Gth :
March, 1850, it was provided: !
"Jlnd he it further etntrfeti, That in all that teriitorv ceded 1
ny fiance to the Hinted States under the name of Louisiana, 1
winch lies north of thirty-*!* ilpjrrec^ and thirty minuter ;
north latitude, not included within the lmiif* nf'the St-ito
contemplated by this act, slaveiy and muiiuntarv sseivi tilde, !
Oklierwiae than in the ptinisnment of crimes whereof the ■
parties shall have been duly convicted, shall be, and is here- !
y, forever prohibited: Pro tided always. That any person '
^scapioff into the same, from whom labor or service is law-
fully claimed m any State or Territory ot the Hinted States,
such tugmve may bo lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to
tiie person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid."
the congressional globe.
That was the compromise. A compromise for
what. A compromise conceding what? Why
that in all the Louisiana territory north of 3$o 30'
north latitude, slavery should be forever interdict-
ed. What should be done below that line > Was
there any guarantee for slavery? Was there anv
security that it should exist there? Was thereanv

In this 0])inton concurred Justices Story, Thomp-
son, Wayne, and McKinley. Justice Catron did
not sit, from indisposition. Justice Barbour, of
Virginia, died before the ease was decided. Jus-
tice Baldwin, of Pennsylvania, dissented, holding
. that the power to regulate commerce was a ne°-n- j
tion to the States of regulating the sale and traffic ■
in slavery between the States. I
t The next instance in their history upon this sub-1
ject, was the annexation of Texas. He should not
undertake to say what motives—what view of pol- i
icy induced the annexation of Texas. He knew ;
diat the mejsute was advocated on various:;rounds: i
That it was advocated by the North and West, as !'
well as by the South; but, so far as he had heard the i|
debates—and he believed he had heard them all ;
he would not undertake to say on what ground the

j South had doubted whether the amendment which
j he had had the honor to submit, was judicious at
j this moment. He was aware that one who had,
I perhaps, always some influence in controlling-pub-
lic opinion at the South, had been endeavoring to
silence the voice of the South upon that question.
He—[the remainder of the sentence was lost.]'
But so far as this territory of Oregon was con-
cerned, the present was tiie only time when the
question should be raised. It was to be done now,
or it was to be done never. If not done, it was to
constitute another precedent, and he did not hesi-
tate to say, that if the South failed to raise its
voice now, it ought to be and would be forever pre-
cluded. Hut what were the circumstances which
