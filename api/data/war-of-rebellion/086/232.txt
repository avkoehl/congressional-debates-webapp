Major General E. R. S. CANBY, U. S. Army,

Commanding Mil. Forces, Dept. of West Miss., Hdqrs. New Orleans:

GENERAL: I have sent orders to Commodore Palmer to send gunboats up to Red River as requested by you. One gun-boat can prevent any force from crossing the river if the rebels have no vessels of war for transportation their men, but gun-boats must go in couples to act to the best advantage in such cases.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain JAMES P. FOSTER, U. S. Navy,

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 22nd instant. The original order to cross the Mississippi River created great dissatisfaction among all the rebel troops that were ordered to cross, but the mutiny was confined in great measure to the Texas troops. Jefferson Davis in renewing the order to cross has endeavored to provide for this difficulty by substituting Wharton's division for Walker's. I have no doubt the attempt to cross will be made by at least a part of the forces now west of the Mississippi. The exchange proposed for the engineer of Captain Ramsay's vessel will be made if there should be no special objection to it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,
