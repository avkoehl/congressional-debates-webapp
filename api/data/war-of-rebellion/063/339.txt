AT THE CROSSING, April 29, 1864-9.20 p. m.

Colonel MANTER:

The wagons are sticking ahead of us. I expect we may consider the passage ahead as stopped until light, for it is very dark. I would recommend some infantry to be marched up to the head of the column by early daylight.

Very respectfully,

J. B. WHEELER,

Captain of Engineers, Chief Engineer.
