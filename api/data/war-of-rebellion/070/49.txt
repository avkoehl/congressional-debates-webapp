On Monday, the 9th, about 9 a. m., the pickets and skirmishers commenced firing, which continued for about half an hour, when the enemy made his appearance on the mountain. About 10.30 o'clock, the enemy having made his dispositions, he advanced to the attack; our troops met him with coolness and determination. Our to their support.

The regiment was formed in two lines (the left wing in rear of the right) for the purpose of charging the enemy. The order
