bloody conflicts with the savages since that period
up to the late Creek and Seminole wars
In all our struggles we have been more than
conquerors, until this Seminole war, which has
cost the nation fifteen millions of money, or more,
m maintaining an army, outnumbering, ten to
one, the enemy, and furnished with better sup-
plies than any army m this country evei had,
aid with the advantages, too, of three of our most
experienced generals of the regular army And
what has been the mortifying result? I will tell
you, Mr Chairman, what has been done We
have many victories upon record here, fiom the
pens of oui officers, some of which I have on my
desk before me, while the enemy, the savage
Seminóle, has not only the ouginal battle field
now in possession, but vastly moie of our tern
tory and soil undei their command than when we
began the war upon them But, what is fai more
disgraceful to our army, and mortifying to oui
feelings, the enemy has the scalps of many of our
unoffending frontier inhabitants in their posses-
sion , for it has so happened that while the ti ontier
was counting on protection from our army, sent
there for that purpose, they have afrbided the
frontier no protection at all, by not deterring the
bavage from his inhuman butchenes, nor puisu-
ing and punishing them after they had committed
them. Thus, while the Government, always
willing and ever ready to discharge herdutyjustly
towards all her citizens, has sent thousands of
men and millions of money to defend and protect
the fiontier inhabitants fiom the Indian butch-
eries, we have had, m return, fiom our officers,
victories upon paper, while the Indians had vie
tones on the battle field, and the accounts of the
scalping of our women and children, and the
burning of their homes, sometimes with the bodies
of the slam victims in them
These scenes have so often occurred, in the face
of our Army, dunng a period of several years,
and under circumstances leaving no justification
for the Commanding Officer of the regular Army,
that I confess, Mr Chairman, I am compelled to
declare here in my place, as a Representative in
part of the good people of the nation, that I feel,
when I am again called upon to vote millions of
money to sustain and support an army whose offi-
cers have, by their lepeated failures, either to
conquei the enemy or give protection to the in
habitants of Florida, I should at least make known
my sentiments No man living can be more will
mg than I am to vote for men and means to prose-
cute a war to piotect our citizens and their rights,
and I have voted for all the appropnations to sup-
port the war in Florida, and I am again willing
to afford all the means necessai y to prosecute that
war to a successful and speedy termination, but,
Mi Chairman, I feel that I am voting money to
support officers (for, as to the soldiers, both reg-
ular and militia, I have the utmost confidence in
them in all respects) that have proved, by their
conduct, that they are incompetent or unwilling
to do their duty, and by detaining them in com-
mand in Florida, and sending them the means of
prosecuting the war, we are actually taunting the
people of Florida with but the name of protection
I am willing to furnish the means of protecting
the Flondians, but I am unwilling to put them in
the hands of these officers of the regular Army,
who have, by their conduct, proved their incom-
petency properly to use them, and in whom, I
again repeat, I have lost all confidence I have
always doubted the efficiency of any officer, after
he has spent some five or ten years of his life in
time of peace in perfect idleness, walking the
streets of one of our large cities, and living upon
the luxuries only to be had in them Take an offi-
cer who has been thus fed, and send him into the
backwoods, where he has nothing but a soldier's
backwoods fare, and he is forthwith unmanned,
physically and mentally, and the thoughts of his
former city dinners, his sparkling champagne, his
evening walks and dances, nine times out often,
unfit him eithei to fight himself, oi to command
others in fighting and just so long as you depend
on such men to commandyoui Aimy,justso long
will you have such failures as you have had in
Florida
I will proceed, Mr Chairman, to show, fiom
the public records on file, and other proof, that
there are just grounds strongly to suspect that
this Seminole war has not been prosecuted, by
some at least of those high in command, like any
other warevei befoie heaid of, for, if one of the
generals there is to be believed, in a late commu
nication to the Hon Thomas H Benton, of the
Senate, it never was the intention of the Govern-
ment, or of any geneial there, to kill these Sem-
inóles, but only to catch them, for he declaies
this, and I now send to the Chan, to be read by
the Clerk, a letter which pioves this fact It
leads thus
Locosr Grove, near Louisvii le, Kentucky,
January 19, 1839
Dear Sir I have received y our letter of the oth instant,
with i copy of the bill to provide for the armed occupat on
andscttlementofllonda II the plan winch you propose can
be earned out the Indians mav be giadually destroyed, or
forced to submit and I know or no other measure likely to
rid the country ot them unless, by lollowmg the example of
the British Government in their warwith the Maroons of
J unaici, we employ the blood bound I lie only doubt I
entertain is, to the eomplete success of the plan uises liom
the apprehen Km that the quantity of good land south of
the twentj eighlh degree ot north latitude is not sufficient
to induce settlers to occupy it, north of that degree, the
country is generally equal to the southern countries of
Georgia and Alabama, but south ot it, the good land is con
fined to a few detached spots along the coast on both sides
of the peninsula , and fresh water can rarely be obtained
on the gulf ccast south of Charlotte s harbor, even where
the land is fit for cultivation Between the mouth of the
Withlacoochee and 1 ampa Bay, there is a considerable
body oí excellent land there is also good land near Cohap
Kiiaga, and between the Ocklawaha and St Johns nveis
I have no doubt healthy situations lor stations or residences
may be found and as to the country north ot the VVithla
cooehee, it is uuitc as healthy as the greater portion of the
western and southwestern ¡states, and the whole sea board
is as In althy as any pai t ol our Atlantic se i bo ird south of
the Del nvare I would a Wise th it the plant! rs and farm
trs be urged to return to the plantations and farms which
the> have abandoned, and the whole country north of
I impa Bay be settled as soon as possible The coasts of
I londa afford as\aluible fishene in proportion to their
extent, as the banks of Newfoundland and though the
c nintry coulh ot 1 unpa Bty afford but little inducement
t > the cultivator a po illation sufficient to confine the In
dians to the interior might find near the coast abundant
suppoit by combining fi lung with cultivation A supply
of Iresh water could be obtained from the adjacent inlands
1 he po ts to be oceup ed by the tioops must depend
necessaiilj, upon the number and position of the settle
ments there should alwajs be a sufficient force in the
neighborhood of each settlement to serve as a rallying point
to the settlers, and to unite with them either for purposes
of protection or pursuit There is a «mall body of good land
on New river, also on the Miami river near Cape 1 Jonda,
which was occupied previous to the war Two or three
hundred inhabitants might support themselves comfortably
on that portion ot the I erruory N t part of the United
States is moie healthy A light house is necessary in th tt
neighborhood and sovaluableisthecouunerce thatpasses
th it pan of the coast, and so numeious the wrecks m con
sequence oftbe difficulty of the navigation, that, to protect
the crews and property cast on shore the country should I
be settled, and military posts be established on New river
and near Cape Florida                                                      I
There is a body of excellent land near Cape Sable the
most southerly point on the peninsula, which would sup
port severU hundred inhabitants this it would be highly l
advmta^eous to occupy is soon as possible A military
post should be established and maintained at the cape ]
Posts will be necessaiv at Indian iuver inlet at the head ot
Indi in river at New Sinvrna an 1 at one or two other
points between the latter post and fat Augu tine A post
should be established at Tunta Rasa south of 1 ampa and
the mouth of the Suwanne those points, of course tobe
determined by the settlements tl at may be m ule on or near
the coast 1 lie posts aeioss the country from the Gulf to
the Atlantic should not be considered permanent but be
changed as the settlements in the interior be advanced to
the south I have read the letter of Surgeon General Law
son and agree with him gener lllj in his views As to the
war which we have carried on in I londa, it differs not
only from any ever before waged by this country, but from
any other of which we have an account m history, unless
the Maroon war in Jamaica be an exception The object
has been, and is now, not to beat and compel the enemv
to make peace, but to catch them No torce employed
against them, either in the former or present Seminole war,
no matter by whom commanded, has ever been able to
catch them, and my decided opinion is, if they ever be
caught,it must be with then own consent, and that con
sent will haidly be given until they find the white man in
their way Let fhiul be crowded by settlers, and that
which has invariably occurred throughout the whole history
of our settlements will occur again they will not only con
sent to remove, but will desire it as the greatest benefit the
nation can confer upon them
W lth high consider ition and respect, your obedient ser
vant,                                                  TH   S   JESl'T
Hon Thomas H  Bfnton
Chairman Committee on Military ¿fairs of the Senate
Will any man now doubt that great mjusticehas
been done to the Govemment and to the people of
suffering Florida, when the general who had un-
der his command eight thousand nine hundred
and ninety thiee men, sent there by the Govern-
ment, with all the necessai y means and mum
tions of war, and placed undei his command, as
we all supposed, to chastise the savages in the
usual way,foi these dailvmurdeis committed on
the frontier people, when we are heie told, in this
letter, that " the object was not, nor is it now, to
beat and compel the enemy to make peace, but to
catch them," and, I suppose by way of dealing
his own skirts of all blame for not catching them,
he says
"No force employed against them,eithermttieformer or
present Seminoie war, no matter by whom commanded,
has ever been able to catch them, and my decided opm
ion is if they ever be caught, it must be with their own
consent "
Was ever such language heard before from any
officer holding even a corporal's command, much
less from a commanding major general of the
United States regular Ai my' Great God' what
will this nation and the world say, when they
see this deelaiation made by this high officer'
If he was acting under instructions from the War
Office, when he was only trying to catch the In-
dians that were daily killing and scalping the
Flondians, I want to see them
I have seen some of the letters from the War
Office to that general, and no such instructions
were m them If he was only sent there upon a
trapping expedition, not to beat and compel the
Seminóles to make peace, but only to catch them,
why was he not furnished with traps and snares,
and such other materials as were suited to his
objects and intentions' Why was he furnished
at an expense of millions of our money, with
cannon, powder and balls, muskets, bayonets,
&c ' And why did he, in a fetter dated " Head-
quarteis, Volusia, Florida, December 12,1836,"
directed to the Adjutant General, Washington
city, (to be found on page 53, in document No.
78,) call foi doutle barreled guns' Aie these
the kind of officers that we are to send a large
army of men under, with all the implements of
war, at an expense of millions annually, to defend
our frontier inhabitants against the Seminole war-
noi, with his unerring rifle and his bloody scalp-
ing knife and tomahawk, and after a total failuie
to stop these murdeis, then we and the suffeung
and bleeding Florida frontier are tauntingly told
that these generals were only trying to catch
these muidenng Indians, and that if ever they
are caught, it will be by their own consent.
Meaning, I suppose, that after all the hellish
murders peipetrated, if the Seminole lias been
fully satisfied and drenched with the innocent
blood of the Tloridians, that then he will come
forward and voluntanly be caught in some trap
or snare that our noble general, who may then
have the command of some eight or ten thousand
men, may have set foi him Great God ' what
sympathy for a bleeding fiontier, and what pa-
tience and forbearance for the Indians' Sir, my
blood boils in my veins, when I think of such
conduct I hope I have the usual portion of good
feelings for all men but I would never wait to
catch an Indian who would murder my wife or
my children, or any of my neighbors I would
dispatch him in the quickest way possible in my
power Yes, sir, I would, if I had the power to
do so, command a legion of fieiy diaggons to go
forth and consume them instantly That would
be my kind of catching and I say that the gene
ral who goes to fight Indians with any othei feel-
ing is unfit for the service, and as soon as that
fact is known, he should be at least disbanded
and stricken from the army forthwith, as unwor-
thy of the name of a soldier
Mr Chairman, I had intended to have begun
w th the disastrous and unfortunate war, and
biought before this committee and the countiy
some of the many facts that aie on record as proof
that the fault was in the commanding officers
But my friend fiom Alabama, [Mr Ckabb,] who
has preceded me in this discubsion, has so ably
and so appropriately noticed the opeiations undt i
the two first generals that commanded there,
(Scott and Gaines,) that I am relieved fiom tl at
pait of my remaiks which weie intended to apply
to their operations I will only say, that I m< st
heartily concur with him m believing tint t e
failuici  undei these commandeis were solely at
i tubutable to then personal bad feelmss tow  ds
