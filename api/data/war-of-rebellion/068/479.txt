STATION Numbers 2, May 6, 1864-2 p. m.

Colonel CLAASSEN:

All quiet. I have been to Pine Tree. All the pickets are at their posts. The Gully calm, as usual. I can see no good spot to dig a ditch. Shall I defer it for the present? I am coming to camp.

JONES,

Captain.

FORT GASTON, May 6, 1864-5.15 p. m.

Colonel AMORY,

Commanding, New Berne:

Captain Graham has just returned to camp, and reports that he went in sight of Evans' Mill; that he saw the rear guard of the enemy; that they appeared to be in full retreat. A small force of the enemy appeared above Brice's Creek. We have given them some shells, and I think they are satisfied. Captain Ransom has been sent to town.

McCHESNEY,

Colonel.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-7.50 p. m.

Colonel SAVAGE:

I think you had better send a mounted guide to the Red House to guide Colonel McNary the shortest way to Rocky Run. Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock, with a force of the One hundred and thirty-second, will be at the Red House. Will you please have him kept reliably informed of anything occurring at Pine Tree?

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

CAMP PALMER, May 6, 1864-9.35 p. m.

Colonel CLAASSEN:

Your telegram received. I have sent a staff officer to Colonel McNary, and also transportation. My pickets were attacked this morning at the Deep Gully, and skirmishing continued for more than an hour with a force of the enemy, probably not large, but which comprised both infantry and cavalry. In accordance with my standing instructions, the facts of the case were communicated at once to Colonel McNary by the officer of the picket, and no other message whatever was sent. That message was of course verbal, and sent by an orderly, who seems to have given his own views of the case, instead of telling merely what he had been sent to say. I am certain, however, that the officer raised no false alarm, and is in no way culpable.

JAS. W. SAVAGE,

Colonel Twelfth New York Cavalry.
