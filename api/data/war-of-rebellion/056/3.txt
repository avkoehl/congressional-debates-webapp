TRENTON VALLEY, November 1, 1863-12.30 p.m.

General REYNOLDS:

The line necessary to defend Kelley's Ferry road and this valley is 4 miles long. With my troops in present position, Hazen's line is of no value save for one regiment at the bridge-head. I request in case of attack General Hazen be instructed to receive orders from me.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS, Lookout Valley, Tennessee, November 1, 1863.

Major-General HOWARD,Commanding Eleventh Corps:

The general commanding desires you to send all the wagons you can spare to Bridgeport for rations and forage. He desires you, if possible, to get seven or eight days' rations and forage ahead, that may be used in case of emergency. He also desires that all the axes now in your corps may be sent to General Schurz this morning that he may finish his lines as nearly as possible to-day. You can get an escort this morning for your train to Bridgeport at Wauhatchie, which will go with it about 4 miles, which is far enough. Your teams going down can get forage along the road.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

H. W. PERKINS,

Lieutenant, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. Gen.
