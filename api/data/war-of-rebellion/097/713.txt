General PATRICK,

Provost-Marshal-General:

I desire only to carry out, and not in any way to impede, the intentions of General Grant respecting the fragments of the Army of the Potomac left behind, as well as all troops placed under my charge. There has been necessarily considerable confusion in the matter, and much difficulty among conflicting orders from different headquarters in deterring the real wishes of the commanding general. From the tenor of the recent despatches and orders I supposed it to be intended to place to Army of the James in charge of the line from Richmond down the James and along the railroad west to some point from which the Army of the Potomac would extend westward. I cannot see why General Collis can better carry out his orders respecting the charge of prisoners by retaining command of the post at City Point; and as the order to me to relieve the garrison at City Point was positive I do not feel at liberty tho continue General Collis in the command any longer. My dispatch of last night, therefore, while it relieves him, leaves him at least equally able to obey any orders of General Meade, as well as makes him responsible for disobedience of them. I make this explanation, general, out of respect to yourself and the opinion expressed by you last night; and I assure you again that my only desire is to obey the orders and carry out the wishes of General Grant.
