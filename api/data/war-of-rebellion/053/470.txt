I have just shown your telegram to Secretary of the Navy, and he will immediately order Admiral Porter to put gun-boats into the Cumberland; and also, if possible, into the Tennessee. If the latter becomes navigable, General Allen should send forage and supplies to Eastport for Sherman's army. It now requires a very large force to guard the railroad.
