Salt Duties—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
moment, an article of monopoly and extortion in
the West. As high as two, three, or four dollars
have been extorted for it for the nominal bushel
of fifty pounds The works at Kenhawa are noto-
riously a monopoly from which the double curse
of a stinted supply and an increased price is in-
flicted upon the country. 2 This salt duty is the
pretext for keeping up an annual dram from the
Treasury of about $250,000 for the fishing boun-
ties and allowances, three fourths of which is now
proved to be unduly paid 3 Salt is an article
of universal and prime necessity, standing ne^t to
bread, and without which bread itself cannot be
■well made, and therefore ought to be free of duty
4 This bill applies to alum salt, that is to say, sun-
made salt, which is indispensable in the provision
trade of the United States, which is not made at
home. 5 The free use of salt is necessary to the
great stock-raising and provision-curing region of
the West 6 A salt tax is fundamentally wrong
in itself, and contrary to the first principles of po-
litical economy, and is so admitted now to be in
Kn^land, where the duty on foreign salt is totally
abolished. 7 The duty on salt does infinitely
more mischief to the community than it brings
revenue to the Treasury 8 This duty fosters
regraters in the sea-ports, and monopolizers in the
interior. 9 It is already too low to answer the
purpose either of a protecting duty, or of revenue,
it answers no purpose but to keep up the fishing
allowances, and to foster the extortions of monop-
olizers. 10. It is a duty which has always been
laid on, and taken off separately It was abol-
ished by a separate act in Mr Jeffeison's time
It was renewed by a separate bill at the com
mencement of the v. ai, it was continued by a sep-
arate bill at the end of the war 11 It was a
war tax, brought in with nine other taxes to sup-
port the war, the whole of which have long since
ceased, except this single one, which ought to
have been the first to cease. 12 The whole piod-
uct of the salt works are but about six millions
of bushels, after fifty years of encouragement, a
quantity which is barely sufficient to salt the sheep
of the United States as sheep are salted in Eng-
land, and of a quality to unfit it for the great pur-
poses of curing provisions 13. We are obliged
to obtain all thegood salt from abroad, and, there
fore it is tyranny to tax it 14 The war argument
has no force We have had but three yeais' foi-
eign war in near sixty years, and there is no wis-
dom in taxmgourselves during ourlong seasons of
peace by keeping up a duty on foieign salt, undei
the delusive idea of gettms a home supply in time
of war. These, sir, are reason-5, for proceeding
separately upon the aiticle of salt, and a<¡ for the
compromise, so called, I answer, fast, its obliga-
tory force has been denied by a vote of this Senate,
on the bill, two sessions ago, to reduce duties on
many articles, of which sail was one, secondly, that
that act was defective in not providing for a reduc
Hon of the fishing allowances in the same degree
in which the salt duty should be reduced
Having now finished his reply to the Senator
from Massachusetts, [Mr Davis,] on the issue
joined befween them,Mr B would next give some
attention to another branch of the subject, namely,
the importance to \griculture and to manufac-
tures in having a total repeal of the salt duties,
and a free use of that article On this head he
would avail himself of the celebrated papers on the
salt duties printed by order of the British House
of Commons, and would read from the volume
which contained them.    Mr  B. then read
1 From Sir Johk Sinclair's Evidence —Extract
" I was once at the farm of a great farmer in the Nether
lands, a Mr Messelman, at Chenoi, near Wivre, where 1
was surprised to seean immense heap of Cheshire rock salt,
which he said he found of the gre ttesi use for hisstoek He
said, first that, by allowing his sheep to lick u, the rot was
efipctually prevented, secondly, that his cattle, to whom he
gave lumps of it to lick, were thereby protected from intec
tious disorders, and the cows being thus rendered more
healthy, and being induced to take a greater quantity of
liquid gave more milk And I saw lumps of this salt to
winch the cows had access m the place where they were
kept He also said, that a smalt quantity pounded was found
very beneficial to the horses when new oals were given
them, if the oats were at all moist ' * * * "He
gave them great lumps, ihat they (the cattle) might lick
when they chose " * * * « 0ne oi the most
important uses of salt, as connected with agriculture, is, that
it preserves seed, when sown, from the attacks of the grub "
* * * " In a communication to me from Sweden,
by Baron Sehultz, he says, the salt destroys the different
sorts of worms found in the bodies of sheep, butm particu-
lar the liver worm  '
2  Arthur Young's Testimony —Extract.
"Did you ever trv silt in the feeding of jour cattle?"
"Yes, but chiefly with sheep, and I found the sheep
astonishingly fond of it "
" Do you think that it would be beneficial in preventing
the rot m sheep?"
" I found it so in the years when my neighbor"' sheep
were generally affected with the rot my sheep escaped, and
my laud was quite as wet as my neighbor ' "
" Do you tlmik, considering the advantages in health,
fattening, and the power of u mg inferior food in the feed
mg nf cattle vid stock m general and the free use of salt,
would be in advantage equivalent to seven shillings a head
to the farmer > '
" I should think it would be worth a great deal more I
Ihink it is invaluable In short, let my answer be what it
would, it would be under the mark "
Dr. Young then gave his opinion that the stock
in England would bemcreasedm value above three
millions sterling, nearly fifteen millions of dollars,
by the free use of salt He estimated the stock in
England to be—
Horses...................1,500,000 head.
Cattle...................   4,500,000   do.
Sheep................30,000,000    do.
3   Testimony of William Glover, superintendent of the
cattle of the Hon   Mi   Curwen, M P —Extract
" This deponent began to give salt to the cattle under his
care 19ih November, 1817, and from that time till now the
eattle have had salt, as follows 40 milch cows and breed
mg heifers, each 4 ounces per day, JO oxen, 4 ounces each
per day, 27 young cattle, each 9 ounces per day, 96 calve*,
1 ounce each per day , 48 horses, each 4 ounces per day,
444 sheep, 9 ounces each per week The advantage of salt
ior sheep appears to this deponent to be great, a" he says
none of the stock have died in the sickness since they com
inenced giving salt, and the} hive h id none in the rot, m
oilier yeirs tluy lost some of the ewf s and wethers in the
sickness And this deponent say s that he has now kept the
cattle at Schoose farm ten years, and they were never so
long without sickness "

u We, the undersigned, heing farmers, and the owners of
land in the neighboihood of Woikingion, do hereby certify,
that we are acqunnted with and witnesses to the fact, of
Mr Curwen giving =alt to hi cattle and horses, with their
lood, at the Schoose tarm and at Workington , and that we
are desirous of usin" the same for oui live stock if we could
ubiam it without difficulty, and at a cheap rate "
5  Testimony of Mr  Cirwlh, M P—Extract
" In regard to cattle, I have underestimated the quantity ,
because il salt could be had at a moderate jricc, thi re is n )
animal I would give less ihan six stone (fourteen pounds
to the stone) e leh per annum " * * * " I be
heve if «alt were m gemnl use for cattle it would amount
to 340,000 tons— about 14,000,000 of bushels " *   *
" The impon nice of (he tree use of salt to agriculture
can scarcely be estimated too highly Salt contiibutea not
only to (lie health of cattle and sheep, hut accelerates and

6   Lord Kenyon s evidence before the Committee —Ex
tract
"By the information whu h I have been able to collect,
I am induced to considers lit, when sparingly applied asan
admirable manure, especially for fallows and arable land,
and when mixed up with soil out of gutters, or refuse dirt
or ashe., to be very valu ible also on grass lands.   My own
experience convinces me ihat it is very powerful in de
stroymg vegefation if laid on too thick, having put a large
quantity of reluse salt on about one fourth of an acre of
land, which alter two years, still remains quite bare    A
land surveyor of high chaiacter in my neighborhood cen
siders ihat the use of salt would be likely to be very val
uable m destroying the slug, wire worm, snail, &e , which
often destroy whole crops.   He also remembers that salt
was used largely m the neighborhood of the Higher and
Lower Wiches in Cheshire before the duties were raised
to their present height With respeét to its value forcattle,
horses, and sheep I am informed that it is very highly
thought of both as nutriment and as used medicinally, in-
ternally, and externally Its value also is extremely well
known for rendering bad and ill gotten hay more nourish-
ing and more palatable to cattle than even good hay "
7 Evidence of Mr Kinoston — Extract
" In reply to jour queries, as an agriculturist, I have no
hesitation in s tying that salt, it freed from duty, would be
J come one of the most useful ant general articles of manure
that ever was thought of, if properly c omposed, by mixing
it with mud of any kind, the cleanings of ditches and
ponds, t le surface of co irse ground thrown into heaps to
rot, blubber, &c I am also persuaded Ihat if it could be
afforded to be sprinkled on the layers oi hay, when making
into the rick, in catching weaUier, it would prevent its
heating and getting moldy I had onee some small cattle
tied up to fatten, which did not thrive, owing, as ihe bailiff
said, to the badness of the hay, of which they wasted more
than they ate, but by sprinkling it with water in which
some salt bad been dissolved, they returned to eat it greedily
I am free to say, a proper quantity of salt would prevent
eattle from being hooen by an excess of green food "
8  Mr Thomas Bourne's Examination —Extract
" The committee understand you are a merchant, resid
ing at Liverpool"'
' 1 am "
" Can you speak as to the probable effect of the repeal of
Ihe salt duties on your trade '"
" It would be a good thing, in myopimon, forthe cotntry
at large, and also the manufactures '*
< Have you any knowledge of its being used in food for
animals?"
" Yes, to horses m particular "
" Has it a good effect?"
" Yes "
" I hen do you not suppose, if the restrictions were lakes
off, it would come inlo more general use among the farmers,
lor slock of all kinds?"
" It would m that instance We used to have five bursts
in our rock s Ut mine, and Ihose horses always appeared iv
good condition, though very much worked "
" Were they liable to less disorders than those out of the
mine ?"
'  Yes, much less "
" Do you happen to know whether they were in the prac
tice at that time of receiving salt with their lood?"
" Yes, to my knowledge they were "
' In what quantity s"
" About a handlul to a quartern of oats "
9 Evidence of Mr W Horve—Extract
"There are very few farmers who are not aware of the
importance of salt m preserving hay, and restoring it when
damaged Many of those whom I have conversed with on
the subject have used it for these purposes, and it would
generally be resorted to to the extent of ten or Jif teen pounds
to the ton of hay, if the duties on salt were repealed Lord
SomerviHe has furnished most satisfactory in formation on
this subject, and 1 know from respectable authority ihat il
is a common practice in the United Sutes of Amertea to
sprinkle salt upon hay when forming it into neks We
also learn from Lord SomerviHe that Mr Darke, of Bree
don, one of the most celebrated graziers m the kingdom,
mixed «alt with his flooded moldy hay, and that his Here
ford oxen did better on it than others on the best hay ire
had, and he was convinced the hay had all its good effects
from the salt "   *           *           *           *           *           *
' I have learnt from Mr Sutton, of Eaton, m Cheshire, that
he would give thirty tons il20 bushels of 56 lbs each) of
salt a year to his cattle, being fifty cowí, if the duly were
repealed "******
" In many parts of the United States of America, salt is
generally given to eattle "           *           *           *           *
" The excellent condition of the horses m the rock pits of
Cheshire, may be adduced in favor of its benefit in fattening
cattle, and keeping them in health Many counted that
they can attribute the longevity of their horses to the good
effects of salt Mr Iladfield, of Liverpool, furnishes an
instance in his horse, thirty years old He constantly gave
it rock salt to lick, placing it in his manger Mr Young
has furnished us, in the annals of agriculture, with a most
interesting and satisfactory statement (obtained from the
Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris) on
the effect of salt in fattening cattle From this report, it
appears that to i/te unlimited use of saltm.<is to be as
cribed the circumstance of t our times the nuinher of sheep
haung been leared on a STERILE COMMON inccn uould
otherwise have subsisted on it, and that the wool of these
flocks is not only the^nes¿ m the whole country, but bears
the highest pnce of any in Fiance Tile .fineness of the
wool of the Spanish sheep is also attributed, m a great
measure, to the free use of salt It is not, therefore, I pre
sume, an extraordinary position to say that by a proper use
of common salt the same quantity of forage might, on
many occasions, be made to go twice as far as it could
have done, m feeding animals, had the salt been withheld
from them'"
10  Mr CnARLES G   Cothill examined—Extracts
*< What is your profession ? '
"A bacon and provision merchant, residing m Judd
street, Brunswick square "
" What is the nature and amount of jour business, and
how far has it been affected by t ic salt duties "
" About fifty years ago my father established a manu
factory m Vine street, and expended £ 10,000 m adapting
the piemises for the curing of bacon and Ihe salting of pork
Our annual returns were about ¿r>0,000 It is now dunm-
íshed to less than £1,000 annually, in consequence, a« I
apprehend, of the very high duties on salt, as our trade has
diminished progressively as those duties have increased "
