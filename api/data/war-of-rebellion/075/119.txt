HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,May 10, 1864-1.50 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Tunnel hill:

Your dispatch directing me to take a strong defensive position before daylight was received about an hour ago. After consulting with my division commanders I am satisfied it is impracticable to withdraw my troops from their present position in the night and get them into position again before daylight. A night movement in such ground cannot be made without inextricable confusion. I see no alternative but to fight where I am in the morning. I will make my flank as strong as possible. If you apprehend a main attack on this flank, can you not send some troops to re-enforce me?

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Tunnel Hill, May 10, 1864-4 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD,

Field:

GENERAL: Will complete the change after daylight slowly and gradually. I do not know that the rebels will attack you, but they may, and you ought to see that we ought to swing toward our right instead of strengthening our left. Make the change so as to give you as good a connection with Newton as possible, but in any event keep up your connection with the right.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
