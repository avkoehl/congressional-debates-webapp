The rest of the cavalry are scouting on the Goldsborough and Snow Hill roads some six miles out. They found one torpedo in the road, which exploded and killed one horse, and they are now searching for others supposed to be planted thereabouts. As soon as I can communicate with them I will order enough to make the force across the river one-half, over to report to General Couch.
