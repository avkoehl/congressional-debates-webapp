and deceptive comparison between State banks and the tedeia!
banks "
Mr Benton was sustained in his preference for
the State banks by Mr Wright, of Xevr York
The present Speaker of the House, in a speech
delivered by him on tins subject, on the 20th of
June, 1834, ably vindicated the State bank system,
in the course oí which he made the following re-
marks.
" The State babk-3, then, aie to be employed, ei her under our
law as it exists, or un ler the law as Congress, may modily u

especially to those who havo raised the cry 01 a union in the
President o the swoid and the puise, when in fact he f ossesscs
neither The piesent executive does not deslíe, and nevei has,
desired, to retain any disueuonaiy p nvn in the exe ution oi
the laws, which from its nature, is susceptible oí being defined
by law The Executive, and his frion is upon this flooi who
sustain him m the íecent executive measure of the lemoval of
the deposites, desire to see him, and not only him, but [ns sue
cessors m the executive office, relieved fro n the responsibility
of exercising discretionary powei in relation to the sato keeping,
management, and disbursement of t'le pub'ic money, as far as
by legislative provisions, It can be dune Tne bill which has
been presented, contains provisions suited, in the opinion of the
committee who prepared and btought it forward, to attain this
end I have invited gentlemen who mav think its provisions
inadequate, or who may suppose that too much pov. ei is still
leftm the hands in the Executive, to come forwaid with then
modthcafions, stilt further limiting and confining his power If
they will neither accept Oils bill, nut propose to amend and
make it more perfect, th° conclusion iuu3t b" thu they prefer
the law as it is to any new legist ivc \ íov s o i If thev do n >t
co opeiate witn Us m pel lectmg and p issmg tu s bid, the con
clusim will be irresistible that the chaige v,hichhas been made
against the Pi evident, ot a desire to seize upon powers which do
not be'ong t> mm, was d3signed to ptoluce at enoneous im
pression upan the public mind, and s wholly unfounded in
fac, that thfy pielei the existing laws to any amendmen s
which can be made, and, in a word, that the real purpciso to
be elected iy all the violent and impassioned appeals winch
have been made charging hi n with usurpation, was to operate
upoi the public, w th a vuw to piocuie a con in lance of tne
present odious bank monopoly "
In a speech delivered by him on the 10 h of
February, 1835, he said
"The State banks are not only competent to furnish all the
domestic exchange required foi the convenience ol trade, but
hey furnish it at cheaper lates, m many parts of the Union,
han the Bank of the united States has heietolore done the
same business "
In relation to the sub-treasury scheme, offered
by Mr Gordon, which seems to be the pioneer of
the present, in the same speech, Mr Polk said
"Unless the States, and the United states, shou'd both deem
it proper, gradually, and in the end, entirely, to dispci se with
the paper system, and which result is not anticipated, the Gov
einment cannot escape occasional loases trom that quai ter a*id
can nevet hope to escape all lo-s s from banks as fiscal agents
except by the cnpliyment, in then place, of ocher and inch
vidual agents, who will probably be found less respons jle <afe
convenient, or economical
"He coacedes that it would be practicable to emp'oy such
agerts, but does not recommend it, foi the reasons stated in the
patagraphs of the repoit which I have read, and because it
would not, 'in the piesent condition of things, be so e igible a
system as the present one }
"A corpoiation may be safer than any individual agent,
howevei responsible he may be, because u consists of an asso
ciation of individuals who have thiown together their aggregate
wealth, and who are bound, m their componte character to the
extent of 'heir whole capital stock for tie deposite In ad h
lion to this, the Secretary of the Treasuiy may rtquire as heavy
collateral security, in addition to then capital paid in, from
such t corp nation, as ho could Irom an md'vtdual co lector ot
recetvei, which makes the Government deposites safd in the
hands of a bank than it could be with an individual
"It may be well questioned whether the heaviest security
■which the most weal h> individual could give, could make the
public deposite safe at the point of large i ollectlon la the eny
of New York, half the levemte is r illected Sevei at millions
of the public money may be in the hands of a receivei at one
time, aid if he be eoirupt, and shall engage in speculation or
trade, and meet with a íevcrse ot fortun , thelo s sustained by
Government would be inevitable With ample security, as it
was supposed, the Government lost a million or moieinthe
toa case a few years ago 1 he lusses in three cases alone, as
already stated, 1r 1827 and 1323, tth n it was suppose 1 ample
car had been taken to secure the debt, amounted to neai two
m lhoos As, then, between the responsibility of a public ic
ceiver and bank corpoia ons, as banks dj exist, and are Ilk ly
to exist, unler State authorl y, the la ter upon the ground of
safety to the public, are to be pro'encd
' Banks, when they aie safe renmmend themselves to the
service of tho Tietsuiy for ofhei leasons
"1 The mcieased facility they possess over individual col
lectors or receivers, in making transfers of public monev to
distant points for disbursement without charge to the pub 10
lndeel, this is a seivice which individuals, to the extent of our
large revenues, could not perform
"2 It may happen, in the fl ictuauon of the amount of rev
enue and expenditures that there will he, at some times, a con
siderable surplus in the Treasury, which, though it may be
temporary, if it be withdrawn from circulation, and placed in
the strong box of a receiver, the amount of circulation will be
injuriously disturbed by hoarding the deposit^, by which th^-
value of every article of merchandise and propeity wou'd be
affected So that, inasmuch as We cannot an'icipaie or estimate
what the exact amount of te venue or expendltm e mav be from
year to year, there may occ i** an exce s of ie\enue m the
Treasury, not immediately called for to be disbursed, which it
would be very inconvenient to abstract from trade and nicula
lion Whilst the deposite is in a bank, the hank may use it,
keeping itself at the same time leady to pay when demanded,
and it is not withdrawn Irom the general circulation, as so
much money hoarded and withdrawn iiom the use ol the com
munity
" If in the hands of receivers, they must either hoard it, by
keeping it locked up in. a stionL, box, or use it, at their own risk,
in private speculation or trtde or they must, lor their own
security, or on their own lesporibibitity place it at last on deposite
m banks foi safe keeping, until they aie called on by the Gov
eminent foi i
" This temporary use of the money on deposite m a bank,
constitutes the only compensation which the bank receives foi
the risk of keeping it, and Ur 'he service it performs If re
ceivets be employtd, they cannot peiiorm any other service
than to keep the money ,*and m ast be paid a compensation horn
the Treasury "
These evidences, added to the fact, that upon the
question of adopting the sub treasury plan proposed
by Mi Gordon, every friendo! the Administration
save one (Mi Beale, oi Vnginia) voted against it,
as did a majouty of the opposition, I regard as con-
clusive oí the pieiercnce of the late Admimsiration
for the State icnL ov er any oth°r system It has
been said that tne friends of the Administration voted
against this scheme with a view of trying the suffi-
ciency ol the S'ate bank system, that is, to make an ex-
periment, but General Jackson's, Mr Woodbury's,
Mr Benton's, and Mr Polk's assertions are at war
with thi> imputation Each of them attested that
the State bank system had been well tried, and
found amply sufficient for all the purposes of fiscal
agency, domestic exchange*, and sound currency
I cannot believe that the friends of the Administra
tion would thus have experimented upon such an
important ami delicate subject as the cunency,
when there was presented for their adoption a
scheme so constitutional, so lepubhcati so wise, and
so efficient, as the Treasury scheme is now thought
to be
But, Mi Chairman,I am not withoutimtber evi-
dence fromvery high authontv, although thePresi
dent of the United States, in his message to this
Congies-- lepiestnts that this is the third fiscal con
netion between the S a'c banks and the Gnern
ment which has failed, jet he certaml) did not
regard the two previous failures as constituting any
serious objecti m to the system, for in August, 1836,
preceding the last Presidential election, in a letter
to the-honorable Sherrod Williams, of Kentucky,
he ably sustained the State bank system In that
letter he used the following language
"Although I have always been opposed to the inciease of
hanks, I would nevertheless pursue towards the existing insti'u
tionsajust and libeial course—protecting them m the lightful
emoymett of the pnnciples which have been gianted to them
and extending to them the good will of the community, so long
as thev diseñar™ with hdch'v the rlehcate and Hipi ant public
trusts with which the., have oet-n invested
These, Mr Chairman which ha^el-íC ?fforded
fiom the foundation of the Government to the
piesent hour of the value of the State banks as
fiscal agents, mainly offered by those who now seek
to destioj that fiscal agency, and refuse then notes
in the receipts of the public due* This s/sicm,
which w as sound democracy in 1835, is bank rag
anstociacy in 1837 While defending this system
ml835, I vi as a good demoaat; but in 1837, for still
defending the same syste n, I have become a bank
aristocrat, fioin this it would seem that democratic
pnnciples, like deranged currency, is soveuhat
Jluctuaii?i£
Mr Chairman, expel íence, which is the most un
erring of all human guides, one tiuth tested bv
which is worth a thousand theories, has taught us
that ciedit is a plant of delicate charactei, and can-
not, w ith safetj, be rudely handled, it must be
touched as cautiously as you would touchthe sensi-
tive plant Otten has the soundest credit, with the
most ample, although not immediately at iilabie
means, w ithered and sunk beneath flic breath of
unjust and unvvairanted suspicion No credit, and
no credit system can be sustained without confi
dence—confidence m its \etv essence, and when-
ever withdrawn, whether justh or not senouslv
affects it The bankms: institutions of the conntr}
are sustained entirely by confidence, w ithout it their
no'es tvould have no circulation, and they would
not be able to conduct their business profitably
Want ol confidence, then, or w nhdraw al of exist-
ing confidence, must, m the nature of things, gre-th
prejudice these institutions, and deiange and em
barrass their operations
The íecommendations of the President and the
Secretary of the Treasury to discontinue the ptes
ent deposite svstem and the receipt of the notes of
the banking institutions, is basel upon the allega
tion that these institutions have been unfaithful to
their high obligations, and therefore not worthy of
continued confidence The present suspension of
specie payments and its consequences, is the ground
upon which tins recommendation is founded. I
propose, Mr Chairman, briefly to examine whether
the present condition ol the banks, both as relates
to their ability to meet all their liabilities, and the
propriety ol the suspension of specie payments,
justify this charge, and the enure withdrawal ot
public confidence That the deposite banks will be
able to redeem all their liabilities, and that at no
very distant period, is very manliest, not only from
the report oí the Secretary oi the Treasuiy, but
from their actual condition as ascertained and re-
ported to this House Aitei the cautious and rigid
scrutiny instituted into the condition of the State
banks when they were about to be selected I
suppose it will hot be doub ed, that the selected
banks were entnelv responsible, and in high credit
1 have selected eigmeen oi the principal banks in
which the public money was deposited, and three
others selected in 1835 The following comparison
ol their aggiegate condition m relation to circula-
tion and specie, when they were at first selected,
and now, according to the last returns, proves most
conclusively, that in relation to specie and circula-
tion, their condition is materially improved
