remaining portion will be guarded by Colonel Johnson. General Deas will avail himself of every means to be informed of the movements of the enemy on his flank. Should the crossing be forced at any point by a strong force of the enemy, and he cannot be dislodged, information will be given promptly to those on the right and left, and the troops will retire, making as much opposition as possible, Deas toward Columbia, the remainder toward Orangeburg. Commanders will keep themselves in communication with any cavalry in their vicinity, with a view to a perfect co-operation with the cabvalry.

General CLAYTON,

Branchville:

GENERAL: The Fifth Tennessee Cavalry, now at Branchville, is subject to my orders. You will please hold them there for the present so as to cover a movement of Comming's brigade should it be necessary to retire from the river. When relieved by General McLaws you will advise Henderson fully as to the manner of retiring to this place, if practicable, relieving his infantry by cavalsry commander also fully on the subject. There is a large quantity of surplus subsistence stores, which I am trying to put over the Congaree, and it is important this part of the line should be held as long as possible. If forced to move in two or there days and the enemy follow, the cavalry must avail themselves of every point to hold them in check. As soon as Jackson's brigade receives its ammunition it will move quickly to Binnaker's Bridge. I wish the cavalry couriers and vedettes belonging tao the Fifth Tennessee, or Frederick's company, established along General McLaws' line, to be relieved by the cavalry, which has been assigned to him, as I need their services on the right of my line, there being none there. Major George will go down to-morrow to receive and distribute such of the transportation in charge of Captain Courteney, assistant quartermaster, as may be serviceable. To provide for accidents to the telegraph I establish a line of couriers from these headquarters to Branchville to-morrow. Use such ammunition as may be needed for Jackson's and Cumming's brigades from that at Rowe's Pump belonging to the State troops, and I will replace it, or give such vouchers as they may require.
