what is said in relation to the enemy's force is true I shall need you by the time you can reach me.

Yours, very truly and respectfully,

J. L. ALCORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

I have sent courier to Columbus and urged permanent re-enforcements. I have but 1,700 infantry and cavalry combined ready for duty. I should not be left in this exposed condition.
HEADQUARTERS,Camp Beauregard, December 31, 1861-10 p.m.

Major GEORGE WILLIAMSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Columbus, Ky.:

SIR: S. M. Kennedy looks to be, and is said to be, a reliable Southern man; has this moment paid me a most hurried visit, and states, as a fact beyond a question, that the enemy are now south of Mayfield, with 500 cavalry, several pieces of artillery, and a force of infantry, number not known; have made a forced march to-day, and hope to be here by sunrise to-morrow to make an attack upon me. I urge that you shall send to re-enforce me. I think the report cannot be untrue, but it may be exaggerated. I have by my [returns] to-day 1,700 privates, including infantry and cavalry, ready for duty. This force of inexperienced shot-gun militia is not sufficient to hold this place against the number which daily threatens it. The scouting and picket duty is necessarily so heavy, in order to prevent a surprise, that we are kept worn down.

I have sent to Colonel Miller again to-night; hope he will respond. We will seek to discharge our duty, but are in bad plight for a heavy fight. I hope the courier now sent will have a more speedy journey than the one sent a few days since.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. L. ALCORN,

Brigadier-General.
