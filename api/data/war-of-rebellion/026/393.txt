UNITED STATES FLAG-SHIP MINNESOTA,

Norfolk, Va., September 17, 1862.

Major General JOHN A. DIX, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: When the rebels evacuated Norfolk they left a steam gunboat on the stock in this city and the necessary material provided for her, part of which came from the navy-yard. Admiral Goldsborough arranged with General Viele, now absent, to have the hull so far completed as to allow of launching the gunboat, with the view of towing it to the Washington Navy-Yard, there to be finished and equipped. The only expense to be incurred here wold be for the labor, which the admiral assumed to defray. It is desirable to have this object carried out as speedily as possible. I have therefore to request that you will be so good as to cause the quartermaster who has control both of Mr. Burroughs and the building yard to require Mr. Burroughs to hasten the launching of this gunboat, which can be done, I am informed, in eight or ten days.

I have the honor to be, general, respectfully, yours,

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.

WASHINGTON, September 18, 1862.

Major-General DIX:

The two regiments at the Patuxent are subject to your orders. General Banks thinks that one can be spared.

Major General JOHN A. DIX,

Commanding Seventh Army Corps, Fortress Monroe, Va.:

GENERAL: The president of the Norfolk Gas Company recently applied to me, through General Viele, to send a quantity of shingles to the North. This application was promptly referred to the Navy Department, and in reply I am instructed that "no traffic in shingles, cotton, tobacco, or other articles can be permitted in the region blockaded."

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, yours,

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
