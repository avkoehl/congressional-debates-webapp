WILLIAMS' FARM, VA.-8.30 p. m.

General HUGER,

Commanding in Advance:

The officer who brought this from General Magruder's headquarters says Jackson has possession of Mechanicsville. I do not know where Colonel Rhett's headquarters are. I will endeavor to find them, however, and inform him he may be called upon. Would it not be well to advise the Secretary of War at once with regard to Walker's brigade, so as to have it ready to move immediately if necessary?

DREWRY'S BLUFF, VA., June 26, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH:

My pickets and signal officer at the mouth of Appomattox report gunboats and transports, three of each, ascending that river at dark this evening.

J. G. WALKER,

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, VA., June 26, 1862.

Brigadier General J. G. WALKER,

Drewry's Bluff, Va.:

Leave one regiment well commanded at Drewry's Bluff and march with the rest of your force to re-enforce General Huger. Move by the pontoon bridge if you have guides, and warn him of your march by couriers, to avoid accident in the dark. I will direct General Holmes to look out for Drewry's Bluff during your absence.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

PETERSBURG, VA., June 26, 1862.

General R. E. LEE:

Enemy are landing at Bermuda Hundred. If they are in large force I can't resist them till they reach Drewry's Bluff.

TH. H. HOLMES,

Major-General.

[Indorsement Numbers 1.]

I telegraphed to General Walker to suspend his movement until he learned the character of that on the part of the enemy; but unless their landing was in force that he must re-enforce General Huger.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

[Indorsement Numbers 2.]

Action approved. If it should prove that the report is correct, we must try to re-enforce Huger in the morning by sending such force as we have in the city and the supports of batteries.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
