HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 8, 1865-5 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

From what the people of the country tell me, and also the prisoners we pick up, the rear of the enemy's infantry is about four miles ahead of us. The cavalry less. Shall we continue marching until night or halt so as to admit of the rear getting in by dusk and have the rations distributed early?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 8, 1865-5.45 p. m. (Received 6.55 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The general commanding desires you to push on to-night until yu come up with the enemy and be in his presence. No attack is ordered, but it is very desirable to have the army up to him.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 8, 1865-6.30 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB?

I have halted the First and Second Divisions one mile and a half beyond New Store; the Third Division about a third of a mile in rear of the other two. This will enable the trains to get up, and rations to be issued early in the evening. We have come about seventeen miles. You will find a very good camping place on the high ground about New Stores.

Major-General, Commanding.
