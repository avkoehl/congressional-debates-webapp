THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 23,
rily determine when and where and as to what
persons the power is to be exercised.
The Senator from Virginia admits, in the course
of his argument, that the privilege may be sus-
pended as to certain designated individuals or as
to certain designated localities or communities.
If it can be suspended as to one hundred persons ^
it can be suspended as to one. If it can be sus- ,
pended as to a city, a village, or any political di- I
vision of territory, it may be suspended also as
toindividualsby name. JohnDoemay be stripped
of the privilege and so may Richard Roe, John
happening to live ifl New York and Richard in
South Carolina, for instance.
"Now, sir, I ask Senators to consider the incon-
venience which arises from their argument that
Congress alone possesses the power. From the
nature of the duties of Congress, how is it possi-
ble for them, by a separate and specific act of le-
gislation, to determine what individuals or what
particular localities ought to be excepted out of
this privilege? How is it possible for them, act-
ing here as a legislative body, to determine from
time to time whether it be necessary or not, in
reference to the public safety, that the privilege
should be suspended in the city of New York, the ,
city of Albany, the city of Richmond, or else- j
where? How can they judge whether, upon an j
emergent occasion—and such is the character of j
the cases contemplated in this clause of the Con* j
stitution—we ought to suspend the privilege of
the writ as to particular persons? For Congress, j
this would be impracticable; tor the President, it
would be practicable and easy. His functions
are always active; those of Congress are much ot
the time suspended by their adjournments. His
eye never sleeps; theirs areclosed half of the year;
and if the power is exclusively m them and can-
not be delegated to an agent, then ii follows that
the count! y must lose all the benefits of a suspen-
sion of the habeas corpus until Congress can as-
semble and legislate tor the ease, during which
interval the mischief would be done and the com-
munity be given up a prey to the emissaries anil
jgents of rebellion or subjected by the foreign in-
vader.
Mr. CARLILli. Will the Senator allow me
to inte i.,'i him for a moment?
Mt. HOWMID. Certainly.
Mr. CARLU ,E. The Senator«will remember
thnt Justice Story, in treating on this very clause
of the Constitution,says," that as Congress," ho
/toi4 not doubt, and at tile time he wrote no one
doubted, " as Congress alone possess the power
tou's-i • '1 the writ,Congressmustjudgewhen the
public sal' «.y requires its suspension. * I
Mr. HOWARD. That was one of Justice j
Story's early opinions. It was a mere dictum of ■
that learned judge, as the Kenntor will see if In, I
looks into the case; and the opinion was 111 110 i
way involved in the merits ot the eese under eon- j
federation.
Mr. CAI1LILE. 1 do not quote from thr ni*e
to which the Senator refers; i quote trom luy Com-
mentaries on the Constitution.
Mr. HOWARD. Very well. The Senator will
also find that in the clause in the Commentaries, to
winch ho refers, the learned judge puts this Mate-
ment of the principle uridei a snnhle—" it would
seem." I maybe mistaken, but if >ny memory
roircct he will find thnt the judge simply s«iys it
" would seem" to be bo. At any rate, he made
no attempt a? an elaborate ou the /uh-
ject, but dismisses this important clause ot^ the
"Constitution with a very few observations. I he
Senator, however, will find a case \  which Jus-
tice Story, obilcr^ made a similar obset vation, and
in his Commentaries merely quotes from himseli.
Mr. President, on this subject so impoitant to
the country, so important at this time jo reference
to the safety of the Government, a subject as to
which there has been and still is no much waim
controversy throughout the land, as well as in
Congress, and one in reference to which there has
been5so much bitter and indiscriminate censure
heaped upon the Administration, I think justice
and fairness require that the Government should
b<5 allowed to express its own opinions; and if the
Senate will indulge me I will lay before them some
extracts from the opinion of the present Attorney
General of the United States, an opinion in the
conclusions of which 1 cordially concur. 1 think
u one of the most able professional documents on
the subjoct 1 have 8MB, one well worthy o! the
serious, candid attention of every Senator upon
this floor and of the public generally. Sneaking of
the power of the President to make military ar-
'rests, Mr. Bates uses the following language:
" The argument may be briefly stated thus: iti? the Pres-
ident's bounden dutv to put down the insurrection, as (in
the language ot the act of 1795) the 4 combinations are too
power!ill to he suppressed by the ordinary course oi jui"~
clal proceeding, or by the powers vested m the marshal*..
And tins duty is imposed upon the President for the v< ly
teason that the comts and the marshals are too wealc to
oerform it. The manner in which he shall perform that
duty is not piescribcd by any law, hut the means of per-
forming it are given m the plain language of the statute.*.,

he mav find it best to meet them with an aimv, and Mip-
niess tlie insurrection in the field of battle. Ii they seek to
prolong the rebellion and jrather strength hy intercourse
with foreign nations, he may choose to guain the coasts,
and elo^e the port* with a navy, as one of the ino-t etfi
cient means to fcupprcs5^ the mMur^i rum. And it they em-
ploy ^pie? and emUs'ines to gather information, to foi waid
Secret supplies, and to excite new insimections in aid of
the original rebellion, he may find it both prudent and hu-
mane to arren and impri-on them Aiul thi- may he done
either for the purpose of bunding them to ttial and condign
punishment tor their ciunes, or they may be held m cus-
tody for the milder end of lenderincj them powerless tor

« In such a sduto of tiling the President must of neces-
sity he the sole judge, both of the exigency which reqnn^
huu to act and of the manner in which it is most prudent
for lum to employ the powers inhumed to him, to enable
him todisehaige his. eonstitmionai and legal duty—that i&,
to suppress the hisuirection and evc-ite the l.uvs. And

Put ceitaioly the learned Attorney Crcneiul tiid i

of the win of habeas cor}n<\ Tiie court does not speak ot
' susnendmr' the pii\ llegi. oi the w/it, but <d bU^pending the
poweis vested in tne ef>mt by the aci. 'I'he power to issue
! a wriT. can hardly be called a privilege, yet the ind.t ot an
i individual to invoke the protection of his Government in
that form mav well be designated by that :inniv\ Ana I
| should inn r with a good deal of confidence thaube court
1 meant to poeak only of its own powers, and not of me privi-
' lege of individuals, but fo, the tact that the court ascribes
' the poweis to i-ospend t>> tne Legislatuie upon political
j giounds. Its.tvs, 'thatquesuon depends upon pohi.ea^ cou-
! siderations, on which the Legislature is to decide.' I\ows I
I had «mj>po«ed that such ^uestioas did not belong exeiuMvoJy
to the Legislature because they depend upoi/poht'cal cou-
sideiations, inasmuch as the President in his constitutional
and official duties is quite as political a« is the Congress,
and lias daily occasion in the common loutinc of affairs to
detenmne <piostions upon political considerations alone.
'• If by the phrase, the tai<-p<>n<ion of the privilege ol the
wiit of habeas corpus, we mibt understand a repeal of all
power to i&=ue the writ, then I fieely admit that none but
Congress can do it. But if we are at liberty to undeistand
the phrase to mean that, in case of a great and daugerous
rebellion like the present, th« public safety requires the
arrest and confinement of poisons implicated in that rebel-
lion, 1 as frcel} declare the opinion that the President has
lawful power to suspend the puvilege of persons arrested
under such cncumfctancee. For he is especially charged
, by the Constitution with the • public safety,' and he is the
I sole judge of the emergency which requires his prompt ac-
il This power in the President is no part ot Ins ordinary
duty in time of peace ; it is temporary and exceptional, and
was intended oulvto meet a pressing emeigency. when the
mdiciaiy is found to be too weak to insure the public satetj;
when (in the language of the act of Congress) theie aie
'combination** too powerful to be supposed by the oidi-
nary course of judicial proceedings, oi by the powers vested
in the marrhaU.' Then, andnottill then, has he the lawful
authority to call to ins aid the mihtaiy power of the nation,
and with that power peiform hisgi<at legal awl constitu-
tional duty to suppies  the iiwi'roPtion. And shall it be
•mill tli.it when lie lia? lutiglit and captured the iuMirgent
army, ami tia-i seized their seeret spies aiul emissaries, lie
is liimuil to bring tneir liodies beloic any jndne who may
send htm a wi it of hubcai corpus, 'to do, submit to, and re-
ceive whatsoever the said judge shall consider sn that be-
half?1  
I commend this pointed inquiry of the learned
Attorney General to the attention of Senators in
the Opposition. I will read it again:
And shall it be said that when ho has fought and cap-
tured the insurgent aimv, and has seizs< d their secict spies
and emissaries,"he j* bound to bung their bodies befoie any
jud"e who may send him a wiit of huh cm caipu*< ' to do,
Mtbmit to, and icceive whatsoever the &aul judge shall con-
sider m that behalf?'
« T deny that he i>« under any obligation to obey such a
wnt. issued under Mich encuittstances. And in making %
this denial, I do but ioilow tin* highest judu ;nl authouty of

1 claies that if the court bad that power, < then it would be-
i come the fluty of the court (piovided tSi.it it came to the
1 conclusion that the President had decided ineoirectlj) to
1 discharge those whowcie anesi-.d oi detain*- d by the troops

I I have thus, Air. President, felt it my duty to

| Bates with reference to the undoubted and undis-
i! puted j>nnciples upon which he founds it, the Sen-
|' n'torrf on the opposite wide of the Chamber must

l! fallible doctrine of the Constitution that the power
i! to suspend the privilege of tlie wnt oi habeas cor-

be exercised by any other agent of the Govern-

ment. With the utmost respect An the opinions
; of those gentlenmn, I must ?ay, tor myself, 1 rc-
• e;ai'd that piopoMtion as a dowonght absurdity.
■ The ConatituMon contemplates that eases may
, arise when the ju'ivih^e of the writ ought to be
s suspended; and the only real point in controversy
1 between us here, the only one in controversy in
1 the country, is as to the'authouty by which_ or
1 by whom this suspension may take place. I think
' the power is a power justly and tairly pertaining
I to the Executive of the United Stales acting in Ins
' executive eaoaeiiy, and at* Commander-in-Chief
: of the Aimy and Navy. The power to suspend
1 the piivilege, as granted in the Constitution, is a
military power, it is connected with military op-
; erations. it can be exercised only during a re-
! bellion or mi invasion, and only in such an cxi-
crpjicy a« vvc now have before us, when the public
I safety requires that the heavy hand of power
should be placed upon the spies and emissaries
i *who are engaged from one end of the land to ihe_
j other in Stirling up and promoting tin; interest of
! the insurgents.
