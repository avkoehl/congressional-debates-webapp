The batteries, continuing their play upon the confused masses, completed the rout of this portion of the enemy's line,and my attack was therefore made against the forces in my front. The order for the advance has scarcely been given when I received a message from the commanding general anticipating some such emergency, and ordering the move which was then going on, at the same time offering me Major-General Anderson's division. The commanding general soon joined me, and a few moments after Major-General Anderson arrived with his division. The attack was led by Hood's brigades, closely supported by Evans. These were rapidly re-enforced by Anderson's division form the rear, Kemper's three brigades and D. R. Jones' division from the right, and Wilcox's brigade from the left. The brigades of Brigadier-Generals Featherston and Pryor became detached and operated with a portion of General Jackson's command. The attacking columns moved steadily forward, driving the enemy from his different positions as rapidly as he took them. My batteries were thrown forward from point to point, following the movements of the general line. These, however, were somewhat detained by an enfilade fire from a battery on my left. This threw more than its proper share of fighting upon the infantry, retarded our rapid progress, and enabled the enemy to escape with many of his batteries which should have fallen into our hands. The battle continued until 10 o'clock at night, when utter darkness put a stop to our progress. The enemy made his number of prisoners, many stands of regimental colors, and 12,000 stands of arms, besides some wagons, ambulances, &amp;c., were taken.

The next day, like the day after the first battle of Manassas Plains, was stormy and excessively disagreeable. Orders were given early in the day for caring for the wounded, burying the dead, and collecting arms and other supplies. About noon General Pryor, with his brigade, was thrown across Bull Run, to occupy the heights between that and Cub Run, and at 2 o'clock in the afternoon the balance of the command marched to cross Bull Run at Sudley Ford. Crossing the run on the following day, the command marched for Chantilly via the Little River turnpike. The enemy was reported in position in our front as we reached Chantilly, and he made an attack upon General Jackson before my troops arrived. He was repulsed, however, before my re-enforcements got up and disappeared during the night.*

The name of every officer, non-commissioned officer, and private who had shared in the toils and privations of this campaign should be mentioned. In one month these troops had marched over 200 miles upon little more than half rations and fought nine battles and skirmishers; killed, wounded, and captured nearly as many men as we had in our ranks, besides taking arms and other munitions of war in large quantities. I would that I could no justice to all of these gallant officers and men in this report. As that is impossible, I shall only mention those most prominently distinguished. These were Major General R. H. Anderson, on the plains of Manassas, at Harper's Ferry, and at Sharpsburg, where he was wounded severely. Brigadier General D. R. Jones, at Thoroughfare Gap, Manassas Plains, Boonsborough, and Sharpsburg. Brigadier General R. Toombs, at Manassas Plains, in his gallant defense of the bridge at Antietam, and in his vigorous charge against the enemy's flank; he
