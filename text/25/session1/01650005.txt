many have paid out, if not issued small bills, so
as not to be m a situation either to be letamed or to
become fiscal agents, m conformity to the requisitions
of the deposite act A few others, who are in a
legal situation to be selected, decline to receive the
public money under some of Use conditions pre-
scribed by the act
Nor is any national bank in existence, or, inde-
pendent of its inexpediency in a political view,
supposed to be capable of being established < onsu-
tutionally. Hence it is respectfully submitted to
Congress, under all the above consideiations,
whether the early adoption of one of the plans pro
posed is not proper, and w ould not be highly con-
ducive to the public inteiests
VI    SETTLEMENT W Ith THE FORMER DEPOSITE BANKS
Another subject that appears to lequire the early
action of Congress is, the further indulgence which
it may be proper to extend to such of the former
deposite banks as are still mdebted to the United
States
The facts -which are supposed to be necessaiy to
aid Congress in forming a coi rect decision on this
subject will be fully submitted The perils to
which those banks were exposed had caused to the
department much solicitude for several months be-
fore the suspension of specie payments, and led to
some precautionary sugaestions which it felt bound
to make to them, so far as appeared consistent with
the usual principles of banking m this country, and
not calculated, by creating sudden alarm, to hasten
the catastrophe that has «nice happened
Besides the general cautions with respect to the
excesses of bank issues, and the dangerous conse-
quences likely to ensue, which wire detailed m the
last annual Treasuiy report, several instances oc-
curred where the course of the business of some of
the depositories appearing from their returas to be
injudicious, special letters of advice were deemed
proper, and were written A rigid system in re-
qn ling additional specie was also pursued in all
cases of unusual deficiency In regard to the ef-
fect of these steps on the banks, it affords the un
dersigned pleasure to add, that, from the comple-
tion of their selection after the dep site act passed,
to the last returns before their susp msion, a great
reduction in the circulation, as well ,. s discounts of
many of them, had taken place, and, in several
cases, a much larger proportion of specie was kept
on hand Indeed, considering the extiaoidmary
amount of public money paid out by them between
last November and May, amounting to near twenty
millions more than then leceijus during the same
period, it is afact highly creditable to then prudence
and ability, that the specie of all was reduced only
from about fitteen to thuteen millions, and their
cuculation, instead of increasing, fell from near
forty-one to thnty seven millions
As a whole, their specie, compared with their
circulation, continued to be almost as large in May
as in November It averaged more than ent. to
three, or much more than has been customary wi h
the banks m this country, and was ovei double
the relative quantity held by all the banks in
England at the same period, and was in a propor-
tion one-fourth larger than that in the Bank of
England itself Their immediate means, com-
pared with their immediate liabilities, were some-
what stronger in Novembei th?n m May, but were
at both periods neanj 1 to 2*, or greater than the
usual ratio, in the best times, of most banks which
have a large amount of deposites in possession
In this condition of things, the suspension of spe-
cie payment by the deposite banks w as an event
not generally anticipated
The policy since pursued by most of them has
been fa\ orable to an early discharge of their en-
gagements to the Treasury, pnd to a tesumption of
specie payments Many hav e gradually íeduced
their discounts and cuculation, as w ell as paid ovei
much of the public deposites This ma) be more
fully seen xn the tables annexed Since the 1st ot
May, their discounts, as a whole, have been reduced
about #20,388,776, then circulation §4,991,791,
and their public deposites $15,607,316, while their
specie has diminished less than $3,000,000 Of
the number of eighty-six banks emploved at the
time of the suspension, ten or eleven are supposed

to have paid over all the public money which was
ihen in their possession, to the credit of the Trea
surer In the custody oe more than half the others,
an aggregate of less than $700,000 remains unad-
justed Several of the rest still possess large sums,
but many of them have contiuued promptly to fur-
nish such payments fiom time to time, for meeting
the public necessities, that, according to the last
weekly statement, the whole balance to his cre-
dit remaining unpaid in all of them, was only
$12 418,041
The course adopted in respect to the deposites
of disbursing officers, after the suspension of spe-
cie payments, and with a view to safety, as well as
to encourage the early resumption of such pay-
ments, may be seen more fullv in the document an-
nexed
It was considered proper to proceed, and attempt
to withdraw all the public money from the disco i-
tinued agents, as fast as it was wanted foi public
purposes, and as new and suitable depositories
could be procured to receive any thing obtainable
beyond such amount But while the former agents
appeared to be secure, and to be making proper ef-
forts to meet such calls-, t seemed more conducive
to the e\ entual safety of the money, and more
consistent with true wisdom as well as the conve-
nience of the Treasury, to refrain fi oin unnecessa-
ry prosecutions and costs till the early session of
Congress, which had been called, in part, for the
consideration of this subject On t1 e contrary,
when any of the banks pers stcd in neglecting to
puisne the prudent course of curtailment, and in
making no reasonable eftcrts to discharge the
drafts on them in an acceptable mannei, the de-
partment considered it a dutv however unpleasant,
to dehv er tl eir asrecmet ts and bonds t > the Solici-
tor of the Tieasirj f i syi Th s has ?lr ady
been done m nine casec in s rpe as -> mi ter of
precaution, to obtain additional secunty beyond
what had been given, and in otheis, to take the
preliminary steps for an action against the sureties
as well as the principals
Some of the additional banks, rendered neces-
sary to cairy into effect one of the provisions of the
late deposite act, ha ye, on this occasion, proved the
least prompt and efficient in meeting their obliga-
tions But though the losses of a few may he
severe, and consider ible delay may arise in dis-
charging their engagements, aid 'housjh it has
bepn piopei and h is e\ im_ 1 a commendable state
of moral feelma: in m-nv of then to strike at the
root of the presen* excesses in paper, by curtailing
largely both their issues and discounts, and thereby
to make serious sacrifices, yet the condition of
them all appears to be such as will, with the cola-
teral security taken n most cases render the United
States probably safe against any ultimate loss

which had myoh ed some oc the banks, as v ell as

sums, as needed for e\pen1itir aid tiansfer it
was not to be expected that several of th°m woi Id
be able to pay ov er at onoe and m specie the
whole of the large amount then in then possession
More especially was this not to be expected

larger than the proportion hell bv most other
banks, did not equal ->nd could not, w ithout ma-

is presumed that a consideraba poition of the mo-
ney since, as well as fw merly paid by the banl   on
transfers and drafts, has not ben demanded nor

thing else nor, accoul ng to the vipws of the un-
dersigned coal I they be, v ilhouf a •■ íola'io i of Tavv
and sound policy
The drafts of the Treasurci ot del is, when
diawn on banks and not dschaijed on present-
ment, have, undei instructions from this depart-
ment, been often taken up in its behalf by the co1-
tectors and receivers, in order as much as possible

to relieve the public creditor from delay and loss
New drafts, when the first ones were not paid in
an accept'b'e manner, have also in some cases
been given on othei depositories, and have helped
to promote satisfactory adjustments
Since the discontinuance of most of the banks as
depositories, this department has also found the use
of drafts made dnectly on receivers and collectors
very accep able to the public creditors, and by the
specie fort tnately then on hand, and since collect-
ed by the receivers, with a part of what was before
m the mint, and some occasionally supplied by a
few of the banks and collectors, a large amoemt of
claims has been paid, and the Treasury is ready to
pay others so far as practicable, at points and in a
manner convenient to many But, till the indebt-
ed banks resume spec e payments, or increased
collections can be made in specie of what is due
from them an! from the meichants, it must be ob-
vious that the department, however anxious to pay
all the public creditors and officers m specie, when
demanded, is unable to accomplish so desirable an
object
This is one of the evils incident to the existing
state of the moneyed concerns of the country, and
vvhu h cannot be remedied unless CongreoS furnish
additional mea is, until specie payments are gene-
rally resumed Some intermediate losses, by a de-
preciation oí bank notes, must, therefore, fall on
those, whelhei creditors or officers of the Govern-
ment, who consent to take them lather than submit
todelavsm payment
Hence it seems highh reasonable that the Go-
vernment should hasten, as fast as possible, the re-
storation of specie payments, at least by its former
fiscal agents w ho are still in its debt
Tins wou'd put an end to such losses It also
seems propel that those deposite banks which have
not "c lei l v an wered the demands on them, but
have continued to receive full interest on the depo-
sitas they had loaned out, should be required to
pay it on the sums stik retained, and from the
penods when they failed to fulfil their obligations
to the Tieasury It is manifest that the members
of Congress, coming from every section of the
country, would be the best judges of what further
lenity or severity might properly be exercised
towards them, and knowing more intimately the
causes and consequences of the suspension of
specie pay mints by tho oanks m their respective
neigl bo nools, en decide w th er atcr accuracy
whether °ny ink Ooncc could h reatter be extended
to them appiopria ely except on the condition of
an eaily lesjfptnn of specie payments, and an
allowance of interest during any delay in meeting
their fiscal engagements With the means of in-
formation possessed by the undersigned, he does
not hesitate to expieos an opinion that it should not
be done without a compliance w ith such condit ons
As further cadence of the ability of most of them
on tins subject, it w ill be necessary only to advert
to th  abstiact oí their last returis, which has been
previously anrcxed

west, by making much of their c rculation not re-
deemable at norm, but at distant points, and pro-
