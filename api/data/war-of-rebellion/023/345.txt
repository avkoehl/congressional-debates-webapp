HUNTSVILLE, ALA., August 16, 1862. [Received August 17, 1862.]

Major-General GRANT, Corinth:

I apprehend that I have not strongly enough urged upon you the importance of the immediate presence of the troops that are to come here and in as great force as possible. They will not be too soon if they come by forced marches. They should by all means not cross at Decatur but at Eastport, except those that may already be near Tuscumbia. Please let me know where and when they will cross. I hope you will press this matter.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

J. D. BINGHAM, Nashville:

The 200 cavalry go with arms and equipments for the purpose of bringing the 430 horses down safely by land. Am glad you have them shod and ready.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

Colonel BAYLES, Tullahoma:

The companies of your regiment, except those at McMinnville, must concentrate at Murfreesborough; let them be marched to that point in good order, and put your headquarters there for the present, reporting to the commanding officer. The companies of Seventh Pennsylvania Cavalry at or near Manchester must go to the same point; let them march under your command and with your troops. Present a copy of this to commanding officer of troops wherever any of the companies may be, and report your progress to and arrival at Murfreesborough.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

General CRUFT, Murfreesborough:

Send two of Colonel Hazen's regiments to Nashville for temporary duty, to report to Major Sidell. Don't start Twenty-third Kentucky to McMinnville before day after to-morrow.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

General CRUFT, Murfreesborough:

Is not the Twenty-third Kentucky at Murfreesborough? If so, send it to join its brigade. It should escort the first wagon train going to McMinnville. Answer.

JAMES B. FRY.
