Manegei s on the pent of the Senate.
JUSTIN S .MORRILL,
GEo!i(in ii. fjjnj>li:ton,
s no(tijEi{.
Manama % on ihc pent of Ike Ilouse.
Mr. MORRILL. Pi limps ihe most important
subj  cts connected with I his bill, in (ho esumation
of the Hou.se, ate the taxes upon beer, liquors,
and tobneco. Tiie eommiuoc of conference agioud
that the tax on nhj and beer should lemam at ^1
a batre!, iiml' that the tax on liquor should be
§1 51) a gallon fiom and after the 1*>L of July to
the 1st of Fubruaiy, ldGo, and alter that per
gallon.
in relation to news[iapery wo retain the provis-
ion of the old law that thoso having a circulation
of less than two thottsand shall not be taxed on
aiiveitisements.
We have agteed to the Senate's amendment
taxing pas.spoits each.
The income tax we have anan^ed so that all '
incomes exceeding ^GOO up to nImI I be taxed
o per cent.; betwi'en >">,U00 and ^10,000, 7^ per
cent., and above £tiO,UOU l'cr cent.
The tax in i elation to bank5? has been so amended
as to be precisely the same as that upon the na-
tionaMmnk.s; that i.« to bay. 1 per cent, on the j
aveiage cnculation, 5 of 1 [>er eetit. on capital,
ai.d 5 (d* 1 pei cent, on dtposiis. In additJon to
lii.a ^ per cuit. ot 3 pel CI lit. as a whole is placed ,
upon any excess of cnculation over 90 pet cent. ;
of capital, or ovei any average circuic-tion which j
existed in the six months prior to July 1, 18G5. |
Mr. DRIGGrS. WlyU has been done with the
Senate amendment with regard to. salt? %
Mr. MORRILL. The matter in which I sup-
pose the gentleman from Michigan is interested
is m the tariff bifH, and not in this bill. So far as
this bill is concerned the tax remains as, it was
when thft bill passed the House.
Mr. HOLMAN. I desire to know what dis-
position has been inadeof the seventy-fourth and
seventy-ninth amendments of the Senate.
Mr. MORRILL. Tiie House recedes from its
disagreement to the seventy-fourth amendment.
Mr. HOLMAN. That is in reference to the
salaries of collectors ?
Mr. MORRILL. Yes, sir.
Mr. HOLMAN. How about the seventy-
ninth amendment?
Mr. MORRILL. That is agreed to, with an
amendment reducing the amount to not ov6r
$4,000, and the percentage of commissions on
some of the iaigest amounts was reduced half of
one per cent.
Mr. GANSON. I understand that there is a
tax upon the gross receipts of vessels and canal
boats of per cent. I would ask if it is in oVder
to have separate vote upon the different clauses
of the report.
Mr. MORRILL. That amendment, 1 have
been informed, was introduced by a Senator, fot*
whom I have great respect, from the gentleman's
own State, and after discussion was adopted by
a large vote in the Senate, and the conferees on
the parr of the Senate were unwilling to yield the
point. My own opinion is that the tolls paid might
very well be deducted from the gross leceipta.
Mr. GANSON. I ask again whether it would
be in 01 der to have a separate vote on this amend-
ment.
The SPEAKER. It would not; the report of
a committee of conference mustbe voted upon as
a whole.
A Member. Will the gentleman from Ver-
mont state what is recommended in regard to the
matter of cigars, and particularly as to inspec-
tions?
The SPEAKER. The House recedes from
that amendment.
Mr. MORRILL. In regard to the tenth sec-
tion, a considerable number of alterations were
made. The clause requiring manufacturers of to-
bacco to have it inspected and to have each pack-
age labeled has been struck out. 'In relation to
the other amendment a permit will be lequired
from all cigar makers; but they will not be re-
quited to go to the assessor every month with a
statement and d< liver it to him under oath. They
will be required, however, to keep an account of
the cjgais they manufacture which may be called
for whenever the assessor may deem it necessary.
Mr. KERN AN. I would inquire what has been
done with the amendment adopted by the Senate
in regard to savings banks that have no capital
and pay no profit except to depositors.
Mr. MORRILL. 1 hese wc exempt fiom tax-
ation.
Mr. DAVIS, of New York. I desire fo make
a suggestion in reference to the tax on railroad
companies. That tax is imposedon the gross re-
ceipts without deducting the running expenses.
Now, according to the report of the State engi-
neei of New York, the running expenses of the
railroads of that State average a little ovei stxty-
six pet cent, of the gioss leceipts, leaving less
than thirty-four per cent, for dividends to stock-
holders and to pay interest on the debt. The
payment of a tax of five per cent, on the gross
receipts will leave but little to be paid to the
stockholders. I know of one road in the Slate
of New York and of many roads in other States
that never can divide one cent under this system
j of taxation. I think it unjust.
j Mr. ODELL. I would like to ask what dis-
| position is made of the section providing for the
j sale of stamps?
I Mr. MORRILL. The Senate amendment is
I rejected and that of the House adopted, leaving
! the matter as it is now; or so that colicctors,
I postmasters, stat lonets, or any other pei sons may
■ keep them for sale.
Mr. ODELL. That is satisfactory.
! Mr. MORRILL. Stamps will be distubuted
| as heretofore ail over the country in the hands of
; postmasters and other officers of the internal
' ievenue.
