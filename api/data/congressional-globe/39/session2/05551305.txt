I ccrtify this statement to be correct:
Treasurer's Office, Washixgtoh, February 12,1867.
From this it appears that the currency nom-
inally on hand is $46,807,882 15. Butfromthis
balance there should be deducted the debtnow
actually due and which may be called for at any
moment, amounting to $15,717,293 47. Iteon-
sists of the following items:
Texas indemnity bonds  $371,000 00
Seven-thirty Treasury notes, act July
17,1861  32,300 00
Loan of April 15,1812  64,768 68
Treasury notes, prior to 1867  104,511 04
Treasury notes, December 23,1857  2,600 00
Treasury notes, December 17, 1800   600 00
Treasury notes, March 2,1801  3,600 00

Five-twenty two-year Treasury notes... 1,610.570 00
Temporary loan  13,526,143 75
$15,717,293 47
This leaves about thirty millions on hand
available for current payments. The Senator
from Illinois complains that this balance is
too large, but when it is remembered that this
amount is about the receipts of one month from
internal revenue, that it is deposited by the
collectors with designated depositaries from
Maine to California, and can only be drawn
against as official notice of the deposit comes
to the Treasurer through the offices of internal
revenue, it is obvious that a large balance
must exist. What this balance^ought to be
must be left to the Treasurer. No one can be
more exact and careful than General Spinner,
and no one has more of the confidence of the
country. These balances are drawn against
by him as closely as possible. They must vary
in amount as the current revenue falls short of
or exceeds the current expenditure. Expe-
rience has shown that from twenty to thirty
millions is absolutely necessary as a sinking
balance while the revenue is collected from a
country so large as ours. It is manifest that
this balance cannot be largely diminished
0 due on gold certificates outstanding.
F. E. SPINNER, Treasurer of the United States.
while the fluctuations of both revenue and ex-
penditure may, within a month, exhaust all
that is subject to draft.
Mr. THO MB [ILL. I should like to inquire
of the Senator from Ohio how much of this
money is in the hands of the national banks on
which they are speculating?
Mr. SHERMAN. I can tell the Senator
how much is in the hands of the national banks.
1 cannot answer the last part of the question
as to what they are speculating on.
_ Mr. TRUMBULL. IIow much have they a
right to use?
Mr. SHERMAN. Not one dollar of the
public funds. The money is ordinarily drawn
as soon as it is reported in the ordinary course.
The amount scattered in the various deposito-
ries is Â£20,000,000.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is that in tho banks?
Mr. SHERMAN. In the banks scattered
all over the country.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That is what I wanted
to know: is there $26,000,000 of Government
money in the national banks?
Mr. SHERMAN. That is the amount. I
will send the statement to the Senator and he
can see for himself.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Did I understand tho
Senator to say that the national banks made
no use of this money?
Mr. SHERMAN. As a matter of course
this money goes into their ordinary deposit
accounts, but it is drawn as rapidly as the
deposit of it is brought to the attention of the
Treasury Department here.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I understand tho Sen-
ator from Ohio on that point; but I understand
him also to be in favor of keeping up that
amount all the time; never getting below
$26,000,000.
Mr. SHERMAN. Not at all.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Then I misunderstood
the Senator. I understood him to say it was
necessary to keep at least one month's revenue
on hand which he estimated at about twenty-
nine or thirty millions; and this is deposited
all the time in these banks.
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senator must be
aware that a collector of internal revenue
deposits money in a national bank, at Chicago
for example; lie notifies his chief of the deposit
and the amount of the deposit; in the ordinary
course it comes finally to General Spinner, the
Treasurer of the United States, and is drawn
upon ; that draft goes back ; and in tlie course
of this operation considerable time is con-
sumed ; the money mean time is with the pub-
lic depository ; and the Treasurer of the Uni-
ted States holds nearly twice the amount of
bonds in his hands to secure these deposits
that the aggregate deposits amount to.
Mr. JOHNSON. Are not those bonds to
cover the currency?
Mr. SHERMAN. No, to cover these iden-
tical deposits.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I dislike to interrupt
the Senator from Ohio; but do I understand
him to say that there is on deposit in the na-
tional Treasury an amount equal to that which
is held by the national banks ?
Mr. SHERMAN. Certainly; more bonds
than the banks have Government deposits.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I. happen to know,
unless the thing has been changed lately, of a
bank which had more than live times as much
Government money in its vaults as it had given
security to the United States for.
Mr. SHERMAN. That may be so with
individual banks.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That was the point of
my question. I wished to know whether the
Senator meant to say that there was deposited
by each national bank in the Treasury security
equal to the amount of money belonging to the
Government which it had on deposit. Unless
there has been a change very recently, that is
not the case with some banks to my knowledge.
Mr. JOHNSON. Ill this city they have had
from five to seven millions of Government
money.
Mr. TRUMBULL. And what was the se-
curity that they gave?
Mr. JOHNSON. Nothing like that.
Mr. TRUMBULL. So I have understood.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have no doubt that in
some of the national banks deposits have
been made larger than the amount of security,
but the whole amount of Government deposits
in the national banks is much less than the
amount of bonds deposited as security. I have
a statement before mo showing that the na-
tional banks now have in the hands of tho
Treasurer to secure these deposits United
States bonds to the amount of $00,015,050.
The amount of deposits in the national banks,
including unpaid drafts, that is drafts on their
way, is $20,845,000, so that the amount of
security is about ten millions more than tho
amount of deposits.
Mr. JOHNSON. That is the aggregate;
but that does not show that, there is not in some
banks a great deal more than the securities
they have given.
Mr. SHERMAN. Certainly not; and both
of the Senators I suppose will see that that is
a matter which cannot always be regulated,
because the collector at Chicago, for example,
may deposit $1,000,000 on a particular day:
he is bound to deposit as he receives, lie may
receive large amounts and consequently de-
posit more than that particular bank has
security for. That is unavoidable from the
nature of the transaction.
As for the coin on hand, its amount is gov-
erned by other causes. It is received mainly
in New York from duties on imported goods.
The amount on hand is $97,386,508, of which
$19,902,980 belongs to individuals, and may
properly be excluded from our consideration,
leaving about seventy-seven millions available
for the public service. Ought this to be applied
