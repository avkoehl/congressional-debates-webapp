LOUISVILLE, KY., August 31, 1862.

President LINCOLN:

I am not accurately informed of the force General Nelson had in the engagement, but believe that he had 7,000 or 8,000 men, all of them new levies except Eighteenth Kentucky. His force may have been greater. Enemy's force estimated at 15,000 to 20,000. Morgan has moved from Glasgow in direction of Lebanon. Colonel Bruce, at Bowling Green, says Buckner, with force of Forrest, Starnes and Co., is moving from Tompkinsville toward Columbia and Lebanon. We need drilled troops and drilled artillery.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 31, 1862.

President LINCOLN:

News grows worse from vicinity of Lexington. Many of our troops captured. Rebels on the Lexington side of Kentucky River. Lexington will be in their possession to-morrow. We must have help or drilled troops unless you intend to turn us over to the devil and his imps.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 31, 1862.

President LINCOLN:

Colonel Bruce telegraphs from Bowling Green that a large force, reported to be under Buckner, is at Tompkinsville; that his advance guard were at Glasgow to-day. This place he held with the small force. Over 3,000 men enlisted waiting to be mustered in are without arms, and they are forbid being furnished arms. The rebels will soon have the men and the arms. Matters very bad at Lexington.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief U. S. Army:

There are 1,200 to 1,400 convalescents here and at Bowling Green unarmed. Edson will not furnish arms. The enemy are likely to take the State. I have determined to take the arms for convalescents and for the troops raised in Kentucky ready for mustering and unarmed. They will be slaughtered like sheep if not armed.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:
