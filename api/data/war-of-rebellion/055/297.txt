No praise is extravagant when applied to the officers and men whose bravery and zeal carried the enemy's works under such heavy loss on the 23d, and climbed the apparently impregnable heights of Missionary Ridge on the 25th. I have particularly to thank Major Williston, Forty-first Ohio Infantry Volunteers, and Captain Bowman, Ninety-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, for efficient and gallant services, and, without exception, the subordinate officers of both regiments for gallantry in action and faithful performance of duty at all times. Corpl. G. A. Kreamer, Company I, Forty-first Ohio Infantry Volunteers, deserves especial mention for turning the first gun of the enemy when the ridge was carried, and for capturing the flag of the Twenty-eighth Alabama Regiment on the 23d. Sergt. D. L. Sutphin, Ninety-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, took a rebel flag on the ridge, making two taken by the battalion.

It would be presumption in me to speak in commendation of Colonel Wiley, or to say more than that the loss to himself is less than the loss to the service. Maj. William Birch, Ninety-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, a brave and faithful soldier, fell on the 23d, while leading his men to the assault.

The loss of the honored dead demands their country's mourning, but the manner of their death will be mentioned with just pride always.

The following is a statement of the casualties:
