BOOKS.
Mr. LAI LIX, from the Committee on Print-
ing^ by unanimous consent, submitted the fol-
lowing resolution:
Ilcviked, That there bo published for the use of the
members ot tin- House, by W. 11. & 0. II. Morrison,
of Washington, one thousand copi..- ol tile book en-
titled "Memorial Hot-old ot the Xenon's Tribute to
Abraham Lincoln," and published together with the ,
address ot Hon.tieorgeljdncroit delivered Ifcbiuarv
1J, lSi>:>: .-aid publication to be in strict conformity
with section five ol act ot Contacts pasoed August 1U,
183o, winch provide* as follows:
" If nnv books t-li a! 1 hereafter be ordered to and re-
ceived bv members of Congress, the priee paid ior the
same shall be deducted from the compen1 afion here-
in before provided lor such member or member,-: Pio- i
vid<', l>r>!rrrv. That this shall not extend to books i
ordered to. be printed bv (ho Public Pi inlor dunnsr
the Congress for which said member shall be elected." i
ilr. IAPJJN'. This resohitjon has two ob- !
jeets: first, thai the publishers of the book in j
question may be enabled to ascertain how many i
of the members of this House desire the pubii- I
cation of this book at iheir private expense;
second, that the publishers of all books may
be thus publicly informed that without repeal-
ing an act of Congress passed in lSoti, it is not
within the power of the House to order for the
use of its members any books, except at the
private expense o_f members. Those of the
members that desire the publication of this
book at their private expense will of course
vote in the affirmative; those that are opposed
to it will vote in the negative.
I may state here that this has no reference
whatever to the resolution that has just been
introduced by the distinguished gentleman from
Illinoi-. [Mr. Washim-une.]
Mr. UPSOX. I would ask the gentleman
whether this is repotted for the first time, ot on
reference to lite1 com mi! Lee.

vidni'4 bv law loi Hie payment to non-commissioned
officers, musicians, and privates who served m the
volunteer envalry service during the late war. for
horses furnished bvthein (o the Government and lost
without fault of the soldier, particularly m the fol-
lowing ea^e-:
I'li-st, in eases in which during forced march, or
retreat, or prolractcd engagement, or skirmishing,
hones have been overcome by exercise.and exhaus-
tion, and have died in consequence.
Second, in cases in which horses have been captured
by the enemy, without intuit of the soldier, and when ,
encased in the line of his duty.

Mr. THORXTOX. I desire to make a sug-
gestion to my colleague. This same subject
was referred by a resolution heretofore intro-
duced to the Committee on Military Affairs,
and reported back to the House and referred
to the Committee of Claims. The subject em-
braced in tins resolution is now under consid-
eration by the Committee of Claims, and I sug-
gest to my colleague that he had better send his
resolution to that committee.

lution so as to refer the question to the Com-
uniLce of Claims.

tleman from Michigan that I hold in my hand
a number of petitions referred improperly to
the Committee on Military Affairs. They ought
to go to tho appropriate committees, to be re-
ported on when the committees are called, and
i ask him to permit me to have them referred
to the proper committees.
Mr. UPSOX. I will yield for that purpose.

PENNSYLVANIA CONTESTED ELECTION.
Mr. UPSOX. I now call up the report of
the Committee of Elections in the case of Alex-
ander II. ColTroth and William II. Kooutz of
the sixteenth congressional district of Pennsyl-
vania.
'flic following are the resolutions reported by
the committee:
AVWrThat Alexander II. Coffroth, upon the

sixteenth congressional district ot the State of Penn-
sj Ivama, has tho prima faclc risoit to the vacant seat
from that district, and is entitled to take the oath of
office and occupy a scat in this House as tho It op re-
seniative m Congress from said disfjiet, without pi e-
.ludice to the right of William II. Kooutz, claiming to
have been duly elected thereto, to contest his right to
said scat upon the merits.
That William II. Koontz, desiring to con-
test the richt, of Hon. Alexander II. Coffroth to a
scat in this House as a Representative from the six-
teenth distrnt of the State of Pennsylvania., be, and
iiois, required to serve upon the said Coffroth, within

Mr. UPSOX. On the 5th of December last,
this House by resolution directed that "the
certificates and all other papers relating to the
election in the sixteenth congressional district
of Pennsylvania, be referred to the Committee
ofElections, when appointed, with instructions
to report at as early a day as practicable which
of the rival claimants to the vacant seat from
that district has thoprima facie right thereto,
reserving to tho other party the privilege of
contesting the case upon the merits without
prejudice from lapse of time or w-ant of notice.''
In pursuance of that direction the majority
of the committee in this case have made their
report. B\ an investigation of this resolution
by the House, which will be found on page 73
of the report, and the accompanying exhibits,
it will be seen that there is no person now- occu-
pying that, seat, but that the seat is vacant. The
reason or excuse for that will be found in an
extract from the Governor's proclamation,
which will bo found on page 23 of this report,
iu which, after enumerating the various persons
wdio have been elected from the various districts
