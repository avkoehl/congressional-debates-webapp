(Received 4.20 p. m.)

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

SIR: The names of all workmen at the Bridesburg Gun Factory have been enrolled for drafting. Many seem disposed to enlist to avoid drafting. If skilled gun-makers are drafted, it will greatly retard manufacture of guns, as they cannot be replaced.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The quota of Lancaster County under the call for volunteers is eight companies. We have raised 1,300 men, who are ready to be mustered into service to-morrow, for whom we have agreed to pay a voluntary bounty. Will the county be entitled to a credit for the excess in the number of men furnished on the draft of militia? Please answer immediately.

LEVI S. REIST,

President of Board of County Committee.

(Received 3.25 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

SIR: Allegheny County will more than fill her quota of the first and second call for 300,000 each. Will that exonerate her from drafting?
