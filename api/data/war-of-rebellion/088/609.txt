Send to the commanding officer at Wilson's Wharf and tell him to send two companies of infantry to Harrison's Landing early to-morrow a. m. to take possession there. The engineer officer will be there with a company of engineers to throw up a cover for them. There is no enemy in that neighborhood, and they can land without opposition. Ascertain whether there is a boat at Wilson's Wharf; if not, notify me so I can order one.
