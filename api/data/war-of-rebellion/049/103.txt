prompt execution as an example, the publicity given to which might, and, I trust in God, will, deter others from imitating their bad conduct. In view of these circumstances, I shall therefore inform them their appeal to you is denied.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 27, 1863-1. 10 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Briggs advises me that in the two detachments sent for, the Eighty-third and One hundred and fourth New York Volunteers, there were 7 colored men whom he has retained, awaiting my orders. I presume, as both of the regiments above referred to are filled with white men, that the sending of these men has been accidental. The matter is, however, referred to you for decision, before any action on my part.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27, 1863-3. 15 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

Colored troops will in no case be assigned to white regiments. General Briggs will be directed to send none to the Army of the Potomac.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Colonel Gregg reports a reconnaissance sent out met the enemy near Little Washington. Had 1 man wounded and 1 missing; captured 8 horses. A few of the enemy were driven from Flint Hill.

General Buford reports no change in his front. Had sent parties out after guerrillas near Stafford Store; slight skirmish; 1 horse wounded; captured a number of old muskets, shot-guns, ammunition, and caps, with old uniforms (rebel and Union). These were destroyed. The citizens are represented as being anxious to give information concerning the guerrillas. They say the gag is not large, and is now under Jim Tolson, son of old deaf Ben. Tolson, who lives near Stafford Store.

No later report from General Kilpatrick.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
