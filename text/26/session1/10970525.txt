satisfactory result.   It exempts the Administrauon
of that period from the imputation of extravagance, <
which the unexplained exhibition of the aggregate
expenditures might have drawn upon it  in  the
mmds of uninformed persons..   It clears that Ad-
ministration from all blame    It must be satisfac- ¡
tory to every candid mind.   And now let us apply
the test of the same examination to some year of |
the present Administration, now so incontinently |
charged with ruinous extravagance.   Let us see
how the same rule will work when applied to the
present period; and, for that purpose, let us take j
the last year in the table, that of 1839.   Let others
take any year that they please, or as many as they
please: I take one, because I only propose to give
an example; and I take the last one in the table,
because it is the last.   Let us proceed with this
examination, and sec what the results, actual and
comparative, will be.
Commencing with the aggregate payments from
the Treasury for all objects, Mr. B. said it would
be seen at the foot of the first column m the fir^t
table, that they amounted to $37,129,396 80; pass-
ing to the second column, and it would be seen
that this sum was reduced to $25,982,797 75; and
passing to the third, and it would be seen that this
latter sum was itself reduced to $13,5-25,800 18;
and, referring to the second table, under the year
1839, and it would be seen how this aggregate of
thirty-seven millions was reduced to thirteen and a
half. It was a great reduction; a reduction of
nearly two-thirds from the aggregate amount paid
out; and left for the proper expenses of the Go-
vernment—its ordinary and permanent expenses—
an inconceivably small sum for a great nation of
seventeen millions of souls, covering an immense
extent of territory, and acting a part among the
gTeat powers of the world. To trace this reduc-
tion—to show the reasons of the difference between
the first and the third columns, Mr. B. would follow
the same process which he had pursued in explain-
ing the expenditures of the year 1824, and ask for
nothing in one case which had not been granted m
the other.
1.  The first item to be deducted from the thirty seven million
aggregate, was the sum of all, 146,599 05, paid on account of
the public debt. He repeated, on account of the public debt,
for it was paid in redemption of Treasury notes, and these Trea
sury notas were so much debt incurred to supply the place of
the revenue deposited with the Slates, in 1836, or shut up in
banks during the suspension of 1837, or due from merchants, to
whom indulgence had been granted To supply the place of
these unattainable funds, the Government went in debt
by issuing Treasury notes; but faithful to the sentiment
which abhorred a national debt, it paid off the debt almost
as fastaa it contracted it. Above eleven millions of this debt
was paid in 1839. amounting to almost the one third part of the
aggregate expenditure of that year, and thus, nearly the one
third part of the sum which is charged upon the Administration
as extravagance and corruption, was a mere payment of debt'
—amere payment of Treasury notes which we had issued to
supply the place of our mieplacrd levenue This item being
deducted from the 37 millions, reduces it to 26
2.  The second item to be deducted is stated in the table under
the description of trust funds, and consists in moneys received
in trust for the Chicasaw Indians, and other Indians, on the sale
of their lands, for which the United States act as their agent
and treasurer It amounts to near a quarter of a million,
to wit, «240,694 for the year 1839, but for the three preceding
years averaged a million and a quarter and contributed large-
ly hi swell the expenditures, as they were termed, of 1836,
1837, and 1838 This item had no existence in the year 1824,
so that it becomes a new charge, apparently, upon the Treasu-
ry; but in reality no charge at all, as it was only delivering over
to Indians the money which fhad been received for them.
Vet this item, amounting to nearly four millions in the last
four years, is set down to the reckless extravagance of a mad
and ruinous Administration.
3 The third item to be deducted is the sum of 8717,552 27
for indemnities; that is to say, for moneys recovered from fo
Teign nations, under General Jackson's administration, for mer-
chants who had been plundered under previous administrations,
whore money, when received, had gone into our Treasury, and
was afterwards paid out to the rightful owners as their
respective rights were ascertained. The payment for
1839 was near three quarters of a million; hut for the three pre-
vious years they amounted in the whole to about five and a half
millions; and, according to the accusation of the Opposition gen-
tlemen, constituted so much of the horrid extiavagance of those
years' and here let us mark the difference between the present
times and those of 1824 When, in that year, the sum of nearfive
millions was paid out of the Treasury for indemnities to mer-
chants under the Florida treaty, no one ever thought of making
the people believe that it was a part of the expenses of the Go-
vernment No one ever thought of injuring the Administra-
tion about it. These conceptions have been reserved for the
present day. Now, for the first time in.the history of our coun-
try, or perhaps ot any country, the recovery of indemnities
from foreigners, and their payment to our own citizens, be
comes a dreadful extravagance-^a ruinous waste of money—
for which a mad and profligate Administration must be thiust
from power'
4. The | fourth item to a «nan sum of «4,875 50 for
claims of States on account of expenditures for the general
benefit during the late war.  It was a payment of debt, and
not an expense of Government, and though small in ls39, it had
been considerable in the three preceding years, amounting in
that time to about S230,000,and of course, swelling by that much
the aggregate expenditures of those years, and helping to make
up the monstrous extravagance oi which the country heard so
much
5   The nextitem growsoutof the three per centum fund to
the uew States on the amount of the landc sold within their
limits It is due to the States by compact, as a consideration,
and a moat inadequate one it is, fornot taxing the Tederal lands
For the year 1E39, this item amounted to «63,b70, and, being a
debt due to the States, is no pait ol the Government expenses.
Tor the thiee previous years, v%hen the land sales were at the
largest, and when some of the States had neglected for some
years to draw their money, the piyments on this account
amounted to near one and a half millions of dollars, an I of
course, «welled to that amount the extraxugance ol 1836, '37,
and '38 '   In the year JS24, this item was only 847 714
6  The sixth item to he deducted was neaily allied to the for-
mer It was « 198,530 for the two per centum on the «ales of
the public lands to make roads to the new Stite , and applii a
hie to the Cumberland road In the year 1824 it was only
«17,000, but in the great sales of 1835, '6 and '7, it amounted to
near «1,200,000 Here again was a payment of a debt con
verted into wasteful extravagance'
7. Donations jf money to, or payments on account of, the
District of Columbia, was the seventh item of deduction which
Mr B mentioned It amounted to «126,374 lor the year 1839
It was a new item in the list of Government payments, hav-
ing no existence m 1824, nor until the year 1832 After that
time it had been annual, and as high as «313,000 in one year, to
wit, 1833, and for the years 183b, 7, and'8, amounted toneir
«440,000 It was a gratuity to the District, which had no poh
Heal rights, and it was a gratuity which had no other object
than to relieve H from burthens improvidently contracted, yet
received the usual characterof corrupt extravagance
8   The survey of the coast Was the eighth item which Mr B
explained It was a temporary and extiaordinary object, which
had grown up from a trifle to a large amount within a few years
past, and amounted to «91,995 for the year 1839. Previous to
General Jackson's administration it rarely exceeded two thou
sand do'lars per annum, for the years 183b-7 and 8, it amounted
to about «220,000,
9   Duties refunded to merchants was another of the new and
large items which had lately grown up among our Treasury
payments From 1821 to 1832, it was unknown, yet, in 1839,
it was «179,301, in the yeai 1833, it was «701,000, and for
1836 7, and 8, it amounted to above «800,000 This was a favor,
or an act of justice to merchants, granted by acts of Congress,
•r by judicial decisions, or by reversal of previous construe
tions of the laws It is no part of the Government expendi-
ture, though, being refunded from the Treasury, it goes into the
enumeration, to swell the general aggregate—to swell the cry of
extravagance—and to prove the hostility of the Administration
to merchants'
10   A tenth item to be deducted was the sum of «714,857 for
collecting materials for the increase of the navy This was an
expenditure for the future defence of the country, and averaged
about «SOOjOOO per annum since the commencement of Gene-
ral Jackson's administration, though only «423,000 m 1824 Jt
is clearly no part of the expenses of Government, but an outlay
of money for the benefit of after years, and of posterity
11   Permanent public buildings is anothei of the large items
of recent expenditure Formerly these buildings were of per
ishable materials, and sunk under the decay of time, or the
ravages of fire, for some > eai s past durable materials had been
selected,and fireproof edihcto constructed The expenditure
for this purpose, in 1839, was «1,248,044, and near the same fo
the three preceding years This again was an expenditure for
the benefit of posterity, and not chargeable as an expense upon
the actual administrations
12. The sum of «735,670 for bridges and fortifications, was
the twelfth item which Mr B. pointed, out for deduction, being
both of them expenditures for the benefit of posterity; the ex-
penditure extraordinary and temporary, but the benefit general
and permanent
13   The sum of «1,491,000 for the improvement of rivers,
harbors, and roads, exclusive of the Cumberland road, was
another expenditure of the same character In 1824, it was
but «56,955, but took a start'hen which would have known no
bounds had it not been for the MaysviUe veto
14   Providing arms for the militia of the States, and cannon
iorthe forts, is another expenditure forfutuie times and for pos-
terity It amounted to «474,906 for 1839, and averaged above
half a million a year for each of the three preceding years. In
1624, it was but «171,155.
15   Pensions, except those to invalids, was the next item
noted by Mr B for deduction They were gratuities from the
Treasury, and not an expense of Government They amount-
ed in 1839, to «3,033,764, being near three times what they were
in 1823 They had been an enormous dram upon the Treasu-y
for the last seven years, amounting m 1833 to «4,485,000, and
subsequently averaging about half that sum
16   Purchase of lands from Indians was another large item
to be deducted, aod which had vastly increased of late In
1824, this head of expenditure only amounted to «429167; m
1839 it was «1,708,123; in 1836 was as high as three millions;
in 1837, «2,484,000; and in 1838, it was «4,603,518. These were
heavy expenditures, inenrred for the great object of relieving
all the States from the incumbrance of an Indian population;
but though heavy, it is not money gone from the Treasury ne-
ver to return t  it It all returns, and with profit, m ihe sale of
the lands acquired, yet the vast sums paid on this bead, i  cited
against us as rumous extravagance, for which the Goths should
be driven from the Capitol'
17   Removal of Indians and their wars was another Hem
nearly connected with the last, and subject to the same remarks.
It had grown up of late, and was directed to the good of the
States In 1824it was nothing, in 1839 it was «1,775,914 In
the three preceding years it was, respectively, in round num-
bers, «6,000 000, «6,500,000, and «5,500 000 This is one of
the largest heads of increased expenditure in recent years,
and one of the most indispensable for the States of the South
and West It is appurtenant to the purchase of the Indian lands;
and although large, yet the sales of the lands will far more than
reimburse it
18   And, finally, Mr. B. noted the sum of «232,369 for mis-
cellaneous objects, not reduceable to a precise head, which
swelled the list of expenditures, without belonging to the ex-
penses of the Government.
19. The Kxplonng Expedition was the last of the item*,  it
was ot recent ori?m, amounting to «97,668 in 1839, and to about
«560,0 0 lor the three preceding years
1 hese are the eighteen heads of extraordinary expenditure,
said Mr B and the amount expended for each, and now let gen-
tlemen of the Opposition say for which of these they did not
vote to w hich they now object, and lor which they will not vote
again at this besoi jiil
With tins view of the tabular statements Mr B closed the
exainnutien ot the items of expenditure, and stated the re
bults to be a reduction of the 37 million aggregate in 1839, like
tha' of the 32 million aggregate in lb24, to about one third of
its amount The very first item, that of the payment of
public debt in the redemption of Treasury notes, reduced it 11
millions of dolíais it sunk it from 37 millions to 2b The
othei eighteen item  amounted to «U,b56 977, and reduced the
26 millions to 13J Here then in a result which is attained by
the same proceas which applies to the year 1824, and to every
other year, and which is light in itself, and which must put to
flight and to shame all the attempts to excite the country with
this bugbear stoiy of extravagance In the frst place the ag-
gregate expenditures have not incieased three fold in fifteen
years, they have not risen from 13 to 30 millions, as inconti-
nently asserted by th Oppositi m but liom 32 millions to 37 or
39 And how have fheyiisen? By paying last year 11 mil-
lions lor Treasury notes, and moie than 12 millions for Indian
lands, and wus, removals of Indians and inu ease of the army
and navy, an 1 other items a  enumerated Ihe result is a
residuum of 131 milh >n& for the real expenses of the Govern-
ment, a sum lj millions short of what gentlemen proclaim
would be an ecinommal expendituie They all say that
15 millions would be an economical expenditure very well'
heieis 13J' which i  a million and a halfshott of that mark
The authentic table  sh >w that the aggresate expenditures
for 1824, came within five millions of those of 1839, conse-
quently that, without a deduction for extnoidinary expendí
tures, the charge of extravagance, waste, ruin, profligacy, «fee
might have been raised againn the Administration of that dav,
and some uninformed persons excited against it by a ground
less clamor, yet no one thought ot raising sui h a clamor in 1824
No one then thought of charging, as extravagance, payments
on account of the public debt, and for indemnities to mer-
chants, and other extraordinary expenses Then all parties
made the proper deductiors for payments either temporary or
extraordinary mtheir nature No one sought to mystify or to
impose upon the ignorant No one thought of palming a story
of thirty two millions upon the country as the expenses of the
country All that has been reserved for the present times; it
has been reserved lor our day, and may have been attended
for a while with the ephemeral success which crowns for a
moment the petty arts of delusion practised upon the ignorant.
But the day for this delusion has gone by The classified ta-
bles, now presented, will reach every citizen, and will clear up
every doubt They wilj\ enable every citizen to see every
item of expenditure—to judge it himself—and to demand
of the Opposition gentlemen, if they did not vote for it
themselves, and if they now object to it? Taking the
extraordinary items as they rise, and beginning with the
first, the sum of eleven millions paid for redemption of
Treasury notes, and it can be demanded if that payment was
not right? and so on through the whole list, amounting to twelve
and a half millions The ordinary and permanent expenses,
amounting to thirteen and a half mill ions, no one objects to all
admit that that sum is a million and half within the mark of
meritorious economy It is on the extraordinarias—it is on
the difference between thirteen and a half and thirty seven mil-
lions—that ihe attack is made, and now we produce these ex-
traoidmaries We give a list of them, item by item, with the
amount paid on account of each, and call upon the
gentlemen of the Opposition to narre the one to which
they object? to name ihe one for which they did not vote.
This is what we do, and I will you, Mr President, what they
will do they will not name one item to which they now ob-
ject, or against which they voted' They will not name one;
and the reason is, because they cannot' They voted for all—
they approve all—the country will approve all, except part for
pensions and harbors, and of these the Opposition were the
leading advocates And thus these gentlemen of the Opposi-
tion are presented in the extraordinary light of gomg abroad to
make a general denunciation of the Administration for extrava-
gant expenditure, and when we show them .he bill of particu-
lars, and ask of them to point out the extravagant items, or the
the ones for which they did not vote, they u>ill remain silent!
They will name no item, because they cannot
Mr B said that this Administration and that of General Jack-
son were ready for a comparison with any that preceded them.
Aggregates against aggregates, or items against items, they were
ready for the comparison If any one shall say that the ex-
penses of the Government were thirty-seven millions in 1839,
or thirty nine millions in 1838, we answer that this is only five
or seven millions more than the aggregate of 1824; that the se-
gregate was then thirty-two millions, and the increase is only fa
proportion to the increase of the country If, descending from
aggregates and going into items, it is Baid that sixteen millions
must be deducted from the aggregate of 1824 for payments to
the public debt, and eight millions more for indemnities and
other extraordinanes, we answer that eleven millions must be
deducted from the aggregate of 1839 for redemption of Treasury
notes, and twelve and a half millions more for Indian wars,
treaties, and removals, anda dozen other extraordinanes. This
brings the thirty seven down te thirteeen and a half, and at that
point complaint ceases
Mr B said that the tables which were presented treated every
Administration alike Beginning in the last year of Mr. Mon-
roe, they eame down through the term of Mr Adams, and the
two terms of General Jackson, and the three year* which had
elapsed under Mr Van Buren All were treated «like. The
same rule was applied to the expenditures under eachone The
aggregate was given in every case first; and the*  the «*tr"-
ordinary, separated from the ordinary expenditures, and tns
same items charged and credited in every case. In looking at
the aggregates it will be seen that every Admimsttation needed
this classification, that the aggregate under Mr. Atoms s ad-
ministration was not thirteen millions, as repeated so many
millions of times, but about the double of that! and that this
thirteen millions for that gentleman's administration was only
attained by deducting extraordinanes' by going through the
very process which reduces the expenditure under Mr Van
Bureri to thirteen and a half millions    The smallest aggregate
in the whole table is that of ^rfj^^-nJffifi
ministration, when the public debt had ceased, and the Indian
wMgbad not begun.  The aggregate for that year u fleyenteen
