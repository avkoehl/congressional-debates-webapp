MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representatives
was'received by Mr. P. B. Hates, its Chief Clerk,
announcing that it had passed " An act granting
to the Sackett's Harbor and Ellisburg Railroad
Company the right of way through the military
reservation at Sackett's Harbor, New York;"
also, that it had passed a joint resolution from the
Senate explanatory of an act supplementary to an
act approved the 23d day of May, 1850.
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. There were various sub-
jects pending before the several standing commit-
tees during the-last session of the Senate, which
were not then reported upon. If it meets the ap-
probation of the Senate, I will make a general
motion to refer those matters to the committees
respectively which had them in charge at the last
session. If a general motion is not satisfactory to
the Senate, there are particular cases which I shall
move to recommit.
Several Senators. Make a general motion.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. Then I move that all
subjects which were pending before die standing
committees at the last session, and which have not
been reported upon, be recommitted to the com-
mittees respectively which had them in charge.
The motion was agreed to.
LAND FOR THE LANDLESS.
Mr. CHASE. I present joint resolutions of
the Legislature of Ohio, in favor of the enactment
of a law granting land to actual settlers, and pro-
hibiting the sale of lands to non-residents; which
1 ask may be read.
The resolutions were accordingly read.
Mr. CHASE. Mr. President, the bill which
has passed the House of Representatives, known
as the " homestead bill," is perhaps the nearest
approximation to the wish of the Legislature of
Ohio, which is attainable during the present ses-
sion. That bill has been reporied from the Com-
mittee on Public Lands, and now lies upon the
table of the Senate. I wish merely to Say, upon
presenting these resolutions, that I have submitted
none during my service here with more unfeigned
pleasure. I fully accord with their whole doctrine,
although I believe it is not contained in the plat-
form of any national political party, except that
whose convention met at Pittsburg. The resolu-
tions propose to arrest the disposition of the public
lands by sale. They propose, also, what is of
more importance at the present moment, the free
grant of the public lands to actual settlers in the
several States where the lands lie. A more benef-
icent, a more wise, a more just measure, in my
judgment, has never been commended to the con-
sideration of the American Congress. CJpon all
occasions I shall give it my hearty support; and I
rejoice that the Legislature of my own great State
has been the first to recommend it, by a strong
vote, to the National Legislature.
Mr. WALKER. ^Wisconsin is ahead of you.
Mr. CHASE. My friend from Wisconsin sug-
gests that his State is ahead of Ohio in this respect.
I am not sorry to hear it. I hope that land reform
is not one of those doctrines which have been
modified, in that State, by lapse of time and other
influences, under which, as the Senator told us
awhile since, the condition of public sentiment in
Wisconsin has been changed on other questions.
As the subject of these resolutions is already be-
fore us, I move that they be laid upon' the table,
and printed for the use of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
REAPPOINTMENT OF SELECT COMMITTEES.
Mr. WELLER. At the last session of Con-
gress a select committee was appointed to which
were referred the charges "preferred by Colonel
McClellan against Mr. Bartlett, Commissioner to
run and mark the boundary line between the Uni-
ted States and the Republic of Mexico. In con-
sequence of the fact that the papers in regard to
the subject were not transmitted to the Senate until
a very late day in the session, that committee was
unable then to organize or to proceed to the inves-
tigation of those charges. As there are several
witnesses in the city who belong to the Army, and
who are now under orders to leave the city, I hope
the Senate will agree to appoint a new committee
at once, or to reappoint the committee for the last
session for the purpose of proceeding with the in-
vestigation of this subject, and I make that motion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from California moves that the select committee
raised at the last session of Congress, in relation
to the Mexican boundary question, consisting of
Messrs. Weller, Clarke, Rusk, Cooper, and
Todcey, be continued, and that the subject be
again referred to them.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SOULE. There was another committee
in the same situationâ€”the select committee on the
subjectof Mexican claims. I move that that com-
mittee be continued in charge of the matters sub-
mitted to their consideration at the last session.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee consists of Messrs. Sople, Brod-
head, Bayard, Pratt, and Clarke.
SUCCESSOR TO MR. CLAY.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
following resolution, which was submitted by Mr.
Gwin, on Monday, the 6th instant;
"Resolved, That the credentials of Archibald Dixon, Esq.,
be referred to a select committee of five, who shall consider
and report thereon."
The pending question being on the amendment
of Mr. Mangum, to add to it the following:
" And that pending the action of said committee, the said
Archibald Dixon be now qualified, and permitted to take
his seat in the Senate."
Upon that question the yeas and nays had been
ordered.
Mr. GWIN. I ask the consent of the Senate
to amend the resolution which I offered, so as to
have the credentials referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary. It was tny intention originally to
have the subject referred to that committee, but
