LA GRANGEL, December 3, 1863-1.30 p. m.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Have just arrived. I received your dispatch yesterday at 4 p. m. If I had got it a half hour sooner I could have attacked hem last night with infantry and cavalry; as it was, Hatch attacked them at sunrise this morning and drove them before infantry got deployed.. Lee, Chalmers, Forrest, Ferguson, and other generals were along. Forrest went north with 400 or 500 men, the rest went south. There is but little damage done to railroad. I should think it could be repaired in twenty-four hours. We have 30 or 40 prisoners; as many horses, &amp;c.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.
