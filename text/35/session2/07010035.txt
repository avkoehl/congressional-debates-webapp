Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Senate & Ho. of Reps.
act of 3d June, 1856. The adjustment of two of
them has been nearly completed. The lengths of
these roads and quantities inuring to them re-
spectively are as follows:

In addition to these, a map of the Coosa and
Chattoogee river railroad has been presented, but
no definite action has been had thereon.
Florida.—The aforesaid act of 17th May, 1856,
also makes a grant to Florida. The maps for all
of the roads have been filed, except for a portion
of the line of road to Tampa Bay; and the fol-
lowing is the length of the recognized roads arid
quantities of land inuring:

Louisiaiia.—By the act 3d June, 1856, lamb
were granted to this State for three roads, and by
the act of 11th August, 1856, for one road.
Two of the three first mentioned have been ac-
cepted, ail the official preliminary requirements
have been complied with, and the adjustment
thereof has so far progressed that the lists are
neaily completed for approval.
The grant for the remaining road has been re-
jected by the State, and the withdrawn lands ic-
stored to market.
The length of recognized roads and quantities
inuring to them respectively, are as follows:

! Mississippi.—The act of 11th August, 1856,
! makes a grant to the State of Mississippi of lands
: for four railroads, only one of which has been
i reported, namely, the route from Jackson east-
! ward to the Alahama line, which, by an act of
j the State, has passed to the Southern Railroad
| Company. The map has been filed and accepted,
j the lateral limits of the road laid down on the
1 official plats, and a list of the lands inuring to the
j State under the grant is nearly ready for approv-
I al. The length of the road is one hundred and
i ten miles; area of lands inuring to the road is
, 207,731 acres, exclusive of conflicts, which, when
1 adjusted, may increase the quantity.
! Minnesota.—The grant by the act of 3d March,
1857, makes provision in land to aid m the con-
struction of four roads and two branches in Min-
nesota. The grant has been accepted. The route
of one road and its branch, and part of another
and its branch,are in progress of beinglaid down,
with their lateral limits, upon the official town-
ship plats. When this is accomplished, the work
of adjustment will go on. In the meantime, the
following estimates are submitted:
Miles of
load.
Minnesota and Pacific railroad, (main
stem)   230
Minnesota and Pacific tatliond. (branch.) 116
•Minneapolis and Cedar Valley tailroad,
(branch) 112
453
The map of the Southern Minnesota railroad,
and the Transit railroad, being incomplete, and
not finally acted upon, are excluded from this
estimate.
The following summary indicates the length
only, of such of the railroads as are in progress
i the selections made in lieu of the lands disposed
| of <s in place" from the date of the reception of
notice thereof. Such selections must be made
from alternate sections outside of six and within
fifteen niileg of the road or branch, and nearest
to the tiers of sections granted " in place." No
selection can be made by skipping any vacant tract
nearest the section "in place:'5 and the indem-
nity for a main road must be taken from its b&lt,.^
j and for a branch road from its belt. When roads
! intersect each other, the lands inuring under the
grant, within limits common to each, will be cer-
tified to the State for the benefit of both, jointly.
It ia difficultto convey an adequate idea of the
labor incident to the management of the railroad
business. It is in fact a great undivided land in-
terest, in which the United States are concerned,
to set apart and secure their sections " in place,"
the minimum price of which the law has en-
hanced $2 50 per acre—that being the indemnity
to the public Treasury, which was the avowed
principle in making these rnunificentgrants to the
States, and then to set apart and secure to the
States their lands 4< in place" within the six-mile
limit and the indemnity selections. Then, with
antagonist interests to these v/c have the multi-
tude of settlers, old and new, who crowd along
the lines of the roads, purchasers at private sale, . 
preemptions upon offered and unoffered lands,
50,000 bounty land locations, and swamp selections.
 11 These varied and conflicting mteiests figure in
Q0>()0() '! the adjustment of the claims to the most minute
subdivisions of the lands, and require greater care
and more labor than are bestowed upon their or-
diiuuy disposal.

Wisconsin.—By the act of 3d June, 1856,a grant
was made to this State for two lines of road, one
having a branch. The routes and lateral limits
have been laid down on the official plats, but as

tions, the following is submitted as an estimate

Michigan.—The act of 3d June, 1856, makes a
grant to this State for eight routes, (roads and
Branches.) The maps for the roads in the north-
ern peninsula have been filed; that of but one (the j
Chicago, St. Paul,and Fond duLac) has been defi- i
nitely acted upon and accepted, the adjustment of j
the grant being now in progress. Maps of all .
the lines in the lower peninsula, excepting the i
Amboy, Hillsdale, L-\nsing, and Traverse Bay j
road, have been filed and laid down on the official j
plats. The lists not having yet been prepared, ,
the following are only estimates:

and Fond du Lac railroad  159

Soon after the passage of the laws making the I
railroad grants, lands falling within their proba- j
blc lynits were withdrawn from sale and location; j
as the adjustment of the grants advanced far j
enough to enable us to discriminate between the j
granted lands and those remaining to the Govern- j
ment, the latter class have been released from sus- j
pension, and restored to market. j
The following is an estimate of the quantities ,
of land offered and unolFered, released and re- I
stored: j

1 ASt session, approved 9th of June, 1858, " for the
relief of certain scttleis on the public lands in the
State of Wisconsinthe whole area inuring to
the State of Wisconsin, as heretofore reported, is
634,269.00 acies. Of this quantity, there have
been selected and approved 589,387.84 acres; leav-
ing a balance of94,BS1.16 acres not yet approved.
Under the act abovementioned, of the last ses-
sion, it is found that there are recognized as valid
selections:

For the mode of proceeding in the adjustment j
of the railroad grants, reference is made to the ,
last annual report from this office. j
After the " definite locations" and maps of the
roads have been accepted, no notice is taken of
any inconsideiable modifications the company,;
may find it necessary to make in the routes, but j
the adjustments are made upon the locations as m
reported,provided other rights are not interfered ,
with. 'j
The sales, locations, preemptions, and swamp tj
selections within the six and fifteen mile lateral
limits are entered in our ledgers, and their validity : 1
tested before we begin the preparation of the lists i
of the lands to be finally certified to the State. |j
The grants attach and take the lands "in place" ;!
from the date of the " definite location," and are J j
good against all entries subsequent to that date, |j
except when founded upon settlement made be- j!
fore such definite location, or before an absolute ||
withdrawal. The right of the State attaches to !l
Leaving a residuum of 37,759.43 acres, to be
taken from a large excess, embraced in a list also
on our flies, of tiacts which had been selected in
August, 1855, at Hudson, Wisconsin, to satisfy
the unapproved balance of 94,881.16 acres above
mention ed.

dition of the Dos Moines river grant, in Iowa,

Ample time having elapsed since the proposi-
tions made to the Stare authorities for the adjust-
ment of this grant, under the Attorney General's
opinion of 19th of May, 1856, and those propo-
sitions not having been accepted, the matter nout-
comes before us as a case de novo. Upon again
being called up, it was, therefore, referred to the
Attorney General, for his opinion as to the ex-
tent of the rights of the claimants under the law;
and, after the Department shall be in posses-
sion of that opinion, a decision will be rendered
upon the matter without reference to antecedent
action.
