POTTSVILLE, June 16, 1863.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Civil authorities oppose me. The court yesterday refused to remove the prosecution against depute provost-marshal-general and others to circuit court of United States under fifth section of habeas corpus act of 3rd of March last, and held them to bail to appear. Of case of Abraham Bressler, whom Gane has now arrested, court yesterday granted habeas corpus returnable 2.30 Wednesday afternoon.
