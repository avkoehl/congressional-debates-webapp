Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.

Under the regulations, all cotton is now shipped for account and to credit of Treasury Department. One of the bureaus of the War Department may have funds on hand which might be applied to this purpose, possibly, if it relative importance is such as to authorize a diversion of money from their own purchases. Since the loss of Wilmington foreign purchases will, of necessity, be much reduced.

THOS. L. BAYNE,
