Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: We arrived here just now at the forks of the road, marked Bryant's on the map. We started at 9.30 a.m. from Tracy City this morning. No railroad train had yet arrived. I shall send there for rations and forage on Thursday. Do urge the authorities to have it there. Wood's division is close on our rear. It will camp 3 miles behind us at Pruden's to-night. We will reach Therman, in Sequatchied Valley, to-morrow and cross Walden's Ridge on Thursday. A rebel force of two cavalry regiments is reported in the Sequatchie Valley. The Anderson road over Walden's Ridge is reported blockaded.
