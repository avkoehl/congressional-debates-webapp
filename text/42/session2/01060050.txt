APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 14,
Sale of Arms to French Agents—Mr. Harlan.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
♦ y
-^iylj^ount to more than three hundred
and fifty million dollars.
Mr. MAYNARD. Has my friend from
Ohio inquired at the Treasury Department to
see whether there is any explanation of this
discrepancy ?
Mr. MORGAN. Yes, I have inquired where
the information ought to be found, [holding
up the financial reports,] and I find what'/
Secretary Boutwell contradicted by Secretary
Chase; Secretary Boutwell contradicted by
Secretary Fessenden; Secretary Boutwell con-
tradicted by Secretary McCulloch; Secretary
Boutwell contradicted by himself! What
means this strange confusion in the Treasury ?
I do not charge that it is the result of incom-
petency ; but if not incompetency, by what
name shall it be called ? I do not charge that
it is the result of fraud; but if this confusion
be neither the result of incompetency nor of
fraud, by what name shall this state of things
in the financial affairs of the Government be
known ?
I hold in my hand another interesting table:
the annual statements of the public debt by
the Registers of the Treasury from 1861 to
1871 inclusive. During their respective terms
of office they all agree as to the amount of the
debt from 1861 till 1870 inclusive. Registers
Chittenden, Colby, Jeffries, and Allison, in
his report for 1870, all coufirrn each others'
statements—their figures harmonize to a dime;
but strange to say, in his report for 1871, Regis-
ter Allison contradicts every one of his state-
ments as to the amount of the debt in each of
the successive years from 1861 to 1870, the
total discrepancy being about three hundred
and fifty-one million dollars. And stranger
still, the Secretary and Register at length make
their statements of the debt balance, but he is
indeed a credulous man who will, without
disinterested evidence, believe that the state-
ments of the debt in the report for 1871 are
not forced.
And now, sir, I introduce my last table,
which will, in detail, explain itself:

Mr. MAYNARD. Which is the true one,
let me inquire of the gentleman, if he has taken
the pains to verify it?
Mr. MORGAN. I should be sorry to have
to vouch for any of them. But certain it is,
that such contradictory statements ought not
to be sent from the Treasury, with the expecta-
tion that they will be received without the sus-
picion that fraud or incompetency exists.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman's hour
has expired.
Sale of Arms to French Agents.
SPEECH OF HON. JAMES HARLAN,
of iowa,
Is the Senate op the United States,
February 14 and 15, 1872.
The Senate having under consideration the resolu-
tion of Mr. Sumner to inquire into the purchases of
arms and ordnance stores by agents of France-
Mr. HARLAN said:
Mr. Pujesidext : I shall not detain the Sen-
ate long. 1 desire, however, to state a fact or
two. I do not think this inquiry has been
brought forward in the spirit ot' friendship to
the Administration, nor of friendship to the
parties to whom reference is made. I think
this will become very clear from an examina-
tion of the facts.
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator will pardon
me; I made no reference to any party.
Mr. HARLAN. We will see how that is
as we proceed. We all know from informa-
tion derived outside of this Chamber that the
French Government have engaged in an in-
vestigation to ascertain whether certain of their
officers have defrauded their treasury. It is
alleged that they bought arms in the United
States for the public service in Frauce, and
that the amount of money furnished to these
French agents has not been properly account-
ed for to the French Government by those
agents; and here is the foundation of this
inquiry. An emissary of the representative of
the French Government at Washington, acting
on instructions derived from his superior,
has been making efforts to ascertain whether
he can derive from the records of our Gov-
ernment sufficient evidence to implicate and
prove the rascality of one of their employes,
and has been, as I infer from the papers
presented, sufficiently adroit to drag into this
controversy a Senator on this floor, and is
about to secure the cooperation of the Senate
of the United States in aid of that investiga-
tion on the part of the French Government.
This, I suppose, is the origin of this pro-
ceeding. Had France been able to settle sat-
isfactorily with her agents in New York who
were deputed for the purchase of arms, this
resolution would never have been introduced
into the Senate; but one Marquis de Chambrun
has been unable to secure the information he
desired; he is unable to serve the French
Government as effectually as he desires; he is
on terms of friendship with members of this
body, and is able to enlist their interposition
in his favor. If this proposed investigation
should enable him to prove that the agents
of the French Government have acted wrong-
fully, of course he will secure his meed of
praise from his own Government.
Now let us see what the facts are in this case.
In the report of the chief of ordnance, dated
January 23, 1872, we have the following state-
ment of facts connected with the sale of arms
by the United States:
"At the close of the war of the rebellion this
Department found itself in possession of large quan-
tities of cannon, small arms, and other ordnanoe
stores no longer required, and which it was to the
interest of the United States to dispose of, because
either of their perishable character, the constant
expense of their care and preservation, or their
obsolete patterns."
Here is the origin of these sales.
"At first sales were made by auction, but subse-
quently (July 20,1868) Congress passed a law giving
the Secretary ot War authority to cause to be sold,
at public or private sale, after due public notice,
the old cannon, arms, and other ordnance stores
which are damaged or otherwise unsuitable for tho
United States military service, or for the militia of
the United States, and to cause the net proceeds of
such sales, after paying all proper expenses of sale
and transportion to the place of sale, to be deposited
in the Treasury of the United States."
Now, Mr. President, these sales were made
under the direction of Congress. In the first
instance the sales were made at public outcry
to the highest bidder; but Congress, in its
wisdom, on the 20th of July, 1868, directed
that these sales might be made either publicly
or privately, placing the discretion in that
respect within the official discretion of the
Secretary*of War. The report proceeds to say:
"And since the passage of this act ordnance and
ordnance stores have been disposed of to individuals
at' private sale,' as provided by the law, except in
a few instances when sales at auction were deemed
preferable and to the interest of the Government."
Again :
"It has been the practice to entertain any and all
applications to buy irom individuals unless some
reason for declining was known to this Department.
For example, about half an hour before the time
fixed ior opening the bids lor the pnrchaseof Spring-
field and Enfield muskets, in October, 1870. I was
shown a dispatch from a member of the house of E.
Remington & Sons, stating that they were agents of
the French Government, and authorized to purchase
arms for it. I postponed opening the bids, and im-
mediately showed the dispatch to you"—
The Secretary of War—
" and you promptly directed me to suspend the sale,
and not to entertain any bids from E. Remington &
Sons for arms," &c.
Now, Mr. President, an impartial observer,
I apprehend, would be surprised if told that
that statement is in the very document from
which the honorable Senator from Massachu-
setts read, charging this Government with the
sale of arms to the French Government, or to
the known agent of the French Government.
We have here the official statement of a sworn
officer of the Government, the chief of the
ordnance department, that no such sale did
take place, that the department so'ol indiffer-
ently to private parties who offered the best
and an acceptable bid without inquiry, unless
they had reason to believe that the bidder or
bidders were the agents of a belligerent Power
at war with another at peace with the United
States. Whenever they had reason to believe
that, the sale was suspended.
I know it may be said that everybody must
have known, from public events notorious to
the whole reading public, that these arms
would go largely into the hands of one or the
other of these belligerents; but will it be pre-
tended that the United States has not the
right to sell its surplus arms to anybody
because two great nations are at war? Muse
we retain this vast armament in our armories
and arsenals until they rust and become worth-
less because other nations at peace with us
are at war with each other? It will not be pre-
tended by any reader of international law that
private citizens did not have the perfect right
to sell arms to either France or Prussia during
the existence of a war between those tv\o great
nations. Private parties unquestionably had
the right to sell them and take their hazard
on the delivery; but the right to sell will not
be called in quesiion. The only pertinent
point of inquiry, then, is whether the Govern-
ment of the United States did knowingly sell
to either belligerent. The chief of ordntsiice,
under whose supervision these sales were
made, says in an official communication to
Congress that such sales were not made; that
they were made to private individuals, but not
