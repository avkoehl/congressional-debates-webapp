WHEELING, May 10, 1865.

E. M. STANTON:

I wrote you on the 5th instant giving some reasons why rebel officers and soldiers should not be allowed to return into this State on parole. Allow me to add specifically that the counties composing the State of West Virginia gave over 23,000 majority against the ordinance of secession.

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor.

The Secretary of War directs me to say that the letter referred to in your telegram of this date has been received and that the subject is now under consideration.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, May 10, 1865.

General BARNES, or

OFFICER COMMADNING AT POINT LOOKOUT:

Frank B. Gurley, under sentence of death for the murder of General Robert L. McCook, was improperly sent to Point Lookout on the 22nd of February for exchange. If he has not been exchanged, put him in irons and send him here. If he has been exchanged, state when.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

POINT LOOKOUT, May 10, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Frank B. Gurley was sent to Colonel Mulford on the 17th of March, with a letter calling attention to the charges against him and eighteen others, by special order from the Commissary-General of Prisoners sent by telegraphic dispatch of the 17th of March from Washington. He was received here on the 2nd of March.

JAS. BARNES,

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, May 11, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

R. M. T. Hunter has, in accordance with General Grant's order, been arrested and is now on a gun-boat in the James awaiting further instructions. Judge Campbell is still at his house awaiting the action of the President on his petition. If necessary, he can be confined with Mr. Hunter. He voluntarily submits himself to such punishment as the Governmet may see fit to impose. He is very destitute and much broken down, and his case excited much sympathy among loyal men here. This sympathy is due in part to his known hostility to Jeff. Davis for the last year or two.*

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
