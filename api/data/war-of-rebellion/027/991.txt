In reference to that of Harper's Ferry, we were not at all engaged with the enemy, although brought into position to attack them, as they surrendered after a very feeble defense of their position.

At Sharpsburg on September 17, I am happy to say that my regiment performed much more efficient service, adding largely to its well earned reputation for gallantry. We had scarcely reached the field of battle on the right of our line, when a heavy force of the enemy appeared, with the design of outflanking the Confederate forces which had been
