HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 2.40 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My pickets near Bethesda Church report a brisk skirmish going on now in a direction southeast from that place, apparently distant about 2 miles.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 5.45 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The firing toward Cold Harbor remains at about the same point, but appears to go on brisker.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864.

Major-General WARREN, Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

The commanding general directs that the portion of the Pennsylvania Reserves to be discharged report to the place heretofore indicated early to-morrow morning. The commanding general does not consider it necessary that General Crawford, and the men who are not to be discharged, should go to the trains. He decides that the reorganization must be effected without withdrawing from the front those who are to remain.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Major-General WARREN, Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

The Sixth Corps is ordered to Cold Harbor. Is the road to that place from Bethesda Church open, or does the enemy hold any part of it? Our cavalry are now in Cold Harbor, having driven the enemy's cavalry and infantry, but it is expected the enemy will be re-enforced, and the cavalry forced back before Wright can get there, and therefore it is important he should move by the shortest route.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
