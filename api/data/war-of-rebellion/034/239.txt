Report of Colonel William W. Lowe, Fifth Iowa Cavalry.

FORT DONELSON, April 13, 1863.

Among the prisoners are Major Blanton, Captain Lealer, of Cox's regiment, and the adjutant and surgeon of Owen's battalion. This Blanton is the same who was captured during the winter by one of my scouting parties, and made his escape somewhere north of Cairo.
