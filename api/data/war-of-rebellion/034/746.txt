All telegraph operators in the State of Ohio subject to military duty under the recent proclamation of the Governor are, by the orders of Governor Tod, detailed for telegraph duty until further orders. You will remain at your usual place of business, and will give prompt attention to all military business of the General and State authorities.

General HARTSUFF, Lexington, Ky.:

Governor ROBINSON, Frankfort, Ky.:

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Hobson is close on Morgan's heels, in Clermont County. Morgan will evidently try to cross at or near Maysville. You can release Colonel Hanson from arrest. I am satisfied I made a mistake in arresting him. Please tell him so.

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 14, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

Wallace's position is a good one, and he may perhaps operate in that vicinity for good at present. He is not needed here just now. Morgan was reported at Williamsburg, Ohio, at 4.30 this p.m.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

Morgan was reported to be at Williamsburg, Ohio, at 4.30 this p.m., evidently making for the river. I hope our forces will be able to capture him, or break him up soon.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 14, 1863.

Colonel commanding Advance, Jones' Station:

You must push on after Morgan. Press all the horses you can get your hands on. Feed on the country. I have sent force up the river to intercept Manson, in command of infantry, and I will try to get 2,500 cavalry and a battery off. What condition are you in? Morgan has gone to Batavia, I think. Report to me from Camp Dennison.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
