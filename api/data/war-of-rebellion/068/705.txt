CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

May 13, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General Hancock and Warren and Brigadier-General Wright, commanding the left, center, and right, respectively, will at once throw forward a division of their respective commands to feel the enemy's position. The other divisions will move within supporting distance of the advance, and corps commanders will take such artillery as will enable them to meet an attack of the enemy should he leave his works. The train will remain for the present where they now are, and the telegraph lines will be extended to corps headquarters.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 13, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Wright sends a division in pursuit. Do you wish me to move the whole corps out of its lines or not. I have ordered the whole to move; but, as the troops will lose the day of rest and the lines will be vacated, I have thought it best to refer the matter to you, since finding General Wright sending only a part of his force.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

HANCOCK'S HEADQUARTERS, May 13, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I would consider it safe if you can send me a brigade or two. I have all my troops on the front line.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 13, 1864-10.10 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The indorsement of the commanding general upon the copy of the dispatch to you of 9.30 a.m.* respecting an advance, sent to Lieutenant-General Grant, is communicated to you for your information, it being as follows: "This is what I have done. It proposes no battle unless the enemy leaves his works and advances against us."

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Warren and Wright.)
HDQRS. SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 13, 1864-10.15 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have ordered a sketch of the enemy's position in my front, which I will send you when done. I judge that they have cut off the intrenchments on this flank by a retired line, and hold from General Warren's front across.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
