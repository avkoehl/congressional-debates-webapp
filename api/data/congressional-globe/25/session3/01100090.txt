THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 3,
Mr LINCOLN was at a loss to perceive how
that committee could claim cognizance of this
matter, which belonged to the Committee on the
Public Buildings The latter, too, he stated,had
had the subject under consideiation, and would
shortly be prepaied to bring in a bill for the same
object
Mi CONNOR did not know that the right be-
longed to any particular committee, but certainly
it fell more propel lywithm the jurisdiction of the
Post Office Committee Moreover, two years ago
that committee had reported a bill to the same
purport, to which no objection was then made,
and which bill was only lost for want of time.
The Committee on the Post Office were not tena-
cious, but they were now ready to report a bill,
and intended to ask its immediate consideration,
for it was but recently that the present temporary
building was likely to be destroyed by fire, a wing
to the roof of another building in the vicinity
being on fire
Mi LINCOLN referred to the terms of the
resolution mstiuctmg the Post Office Committee
to " inquire," wheieas the other committee had
already considered the subje ct
Mr BOND moved to stiike out " Committee
on the Post Office and Post Roads," and inscit
" Committee on the Public tíuildmgs "
Mr MERCER saw no necessity foi instruct
mg a committee to in<¡uno into a subject alieady
befoie them, and theiefoio he moved to lay the
resolution on the table, which was disagreed to,
and Mr Bond's amendment agreed to, and the
resolution, as thus amended, was concuned in
Mr ADAMS, fiom the Committee on Manu
factuits, reponed, without amendment, faénate
bill entitled "An ict to itmitoi lefund to the Phil-
adelphia, Wilmington, and Uiltimorc Rtilioiul
Company tin dutns upon attain íaihoad iron "
Mi AI LAN, of Veimont, from thi Commit
tee on Invalid Pulsions, reported a bill gianting
a pension to John P   Wiley

WISCOPvSIN  ELECTION CASE.
At one o'clock the special order of the day,

Ihat, bj the order of the ¡louse as submitted to them,
the only question which presented itself was, whether or
riot the Terntoiy w is entitled to a representation by a Del
egate > In deciding this question the committee could h ive
no difficulty, and might have absolved itself fiom further
tiouble bv li poiting an affirmative resolution But believ
ing the intention ol the House, m making the older, to havi
been that the committee should examine the whole Ground,
and not only report as to the right of representation, but
al o di sígnate thi per o i who was the nghttul representa
tive, they proceeded to perfonn that duty, and repoit the

I he committee is of opinion that although m October,
ls)a Mi Iones was elected a Delegue tor Michigan ler
ritoiy to serve two ¡cars, vet m the natureof the case, his
ti nil of sen ice could not survive the e\tstence of the eor
poration he was t lected to serve if the coipomtion of the
lern < rv of Michigin wis dissolved before the expiration
ot the two veais lor which be was elected Ins office, as
well as that of all other teintonal oihceis, e\pnid x/ith it
It would seim to the committee that the 1 erntorvof Mich
igan, as a political coiporition was no more after the pas
s ige of the u t of lath June, lS3o oigatiizmg and ereeti lg
Michigan into a State for altho igh there wa a comlmuii
in that ict, on oomph tnce with which only she was to be
admitted into the Uní >n, yet that did not deiognte trom
her character as a State, or prevent her from exercising all
the powers of a State Her being a State and, as such,
being admitted into the Lmon, aie two different things
Shi might he a State md was a Stttc, exercising all the
poweis ol a St ite under her own co i titution, hetoie s e
was admitted into the Union, and befoie the e! etion m
Vi isconsm in October, 1Q3& At the time Mr Jones was
elec ed a Deligate for Wisconsin Tcmtorj in October,
1836, he was i ot a Delegate for "i el i„an t erntoij , foi the
plain reason thai no such 1 erntory w as in existence In
December, 1836, he took hi si at, and was sworn, as a Del
egate fiom W isconsin,sinci which he has served twoyeais
—tin lull pe-iod allowed him by 1 nv But it is alleged by
Mr Jones tint, under the act of 1817, a Delegate nm=t be
elected only for one Congress and not for parts of two con-
gressional ttrms, that his term as a Delegan fromWi eonsm
did not commence until the 4th of March, 1837, and conse
quemly will notexpue until the4th of Maich, 1839 In this
the committee does not coucur with him , beeau-e it would
have been leaving Wisconsin unrepresented for one whole
session, contrary to the intention of the people as expressed
in electing a Delegate in October, 1836, in conformity with
the pnv dege granted them for that purpose by the act of Con
gress of April, 1836 , and because it does not follow, from
the act ef 1817, that a Delegate from a Territory must be
elected for and serve the same two years for which mem
hers from the states are elected, but (although this con
struetiou is not given with entire confidence in its correct
ness) the committee would construe the law to mean that
Delegates should be elected for the same length of tune
as litpresentativeslrom the States This construction is
foitiried by the fact that, previous to that law , Deleg ues
I were elected annuallj Such construction will not clash
with any provision of the Constitution, as Delegates are so
far the mere creatures ot law that their term of service may
be long or short, and may commence and terminate at such
periods as ( ongiess, in their wisdom, may duect
But if in this construction of the act of 1817 th> commit-
tee should be in error, still their opinion would induce them
to give Mr Doty the seat, because is the committee be
hi te, that act In& nothing to do with the present contest
It i nothing but an act of ( ongress and, ot cour e, sub|ect
to tbr contiol oí subsequent legislation It was contiolled
(it Mi Joni s s construction of it be right) by the act of
1819, which llirtcti d that the Delegate ot Michigan should
serve two years from the date of the certificate of the Gov
ernor, without regard to the commencement of his term—
whethei it tin hegmmngor m the middle of a teimof f on
giess So would it be controlled bj the act of April PO,
1836 oiftaui¿ino- the Ierntory of H isconsm, whiih gues
tlie p >wi r to its citizens to elect a Delegate to rep escnt
tlu in in Congress without fixing any time for the com
niineiment of his services, consequently, iccoiding to
common construct] )n in all such cases, wilt re m obligation
is imposed oí i duty to bi performed, and no time fixed for
distb ugutg tin obhgition or performing the duty, it is to be
done ioithwitb and therefore the mlerence is that Mr
Jones s duties as a Delegate from Wisconsin commenced
with his election m Octobir, 1836, and terminated with Mr
Dm s election in 1838 Phe act of April, 1836 organizing
tlu leuitory needs the aid of no other , it is pcríect m it
self ai d would sei m to be in lependent of all other acts
On the w nole after all the consideration which the com
mittee h i\e been able to bestow on the subject they have
no hesitition in saimg that considerable difficulty exists m
reconciling the provisions of the different actb which may
be supposed to have a beirmg on the matter, yet theyieil
i great degree of confidence m two positions fir«t that it
w is thi intention ot Congress bvtbe act of Apnl, 1836,or
gainzingthe Terntorj, to aftoid the people ot the Tcintory
tlie privilege of an immediate representation in Congress
by a Delegate to be elected by themselves, and second,
that the people of the Territory acted with a view to the
enjoyment ol that privilege in electing a Delegare m Oeto
her, 1836 I he conclusion would then seem tobe that Mr
Jones has seive I out the term for which he w is elected in
October, 1836, and that Mr Doty is entitled to the seat un
der his election in 1838
The committee submit the following resolution
Resohed, That J tmes Duane Dotyi  entitled to a seat in
this House as a Delegate fiom Wisconsin Teintoiy, and
that George W Jones is not so entitled
