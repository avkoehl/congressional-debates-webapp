1838.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

disturbances on our northern frontier, with sev-
eral other measures of less importance, originating
in Congress, led that body to make appropriations
amounting to nearly ten millions beyond those
requested m the annual estimates     Some pro-
vision of additional means, corresponding to this
excess,  became, therefore,  necessary, and, in
ordei to discharge the excess, and guard against
contingencies, as well as avert the consequences
of a protracted suspension of specie payments by
the banks, Congress wisely granted the addi-
tional authority both to sell the bonds of the
United States Bank and to issue new Treasury
notes, instead of such as might be paid in before
the time for then redemption arrived     The ap
prehensions of embarrassments in the finances
within the year, which had arisen fiom those un
expected appropriations, and fiom the failure that
then continued among the banks in mostquarteis .
of the Union to return to specie payments, were
removed by these opportune piovisions     Occa- I
sions, however, have not yet arisen to require the |
full use of either of them                                       ¡
The whole amount of Treasury notes outstand-
ing at any one time since they were first author-
ized, in October, 1837, has never equaled ten mil-
lion dollai s The amount now outstanding is only
$7,754,500 Besides the restrictions on the tale
of the bonds of the United States Bank, the want
of power to guaranty their eventual payment,
and the short period they had to run, with the
great quantity of State stocks m the market of a
better chai acter for permanent investment, caused
some temporary inconvenience, and prevented
any offer for them above par, either at home or
abroad Thesale, however, of one becoming ex-
pedient, it was effected within the limitations pre-
se nbed It has not yet been found necessary to
dispose of the other But it is expected that,
when the period for redeeming most of the out
standing Treasury notes amveb, it must be sold,
unless other means to meet the public engage-
ments shall, in the mean time, be provided by
Congress
If the íeceipts fiom customs or lands should
exceed the estimates made for the ensuing yeai,
which, in the vacillations of trade, is not veiy
improbable, still it is not supposed the excess
will be so laige that all th^ expected charges on
the year can be defrayed without a sale of the
remaining bond, or some equivalent íesource
The estimates of receipts for 1839 rest on the
following general views An ovei flowing tide of
speculation and bank issues, like that of 1836,
is not anticipated, while the recent evils and dis-
asters fiom these sources are fresh in remem-
brance Nor, on the contrary, is any expecta-
tion entertained of a íepetiuon, so soon, of the
mercantile revulsions which chaiacteii"ed the
year 1837
The receipts fiom duties during the last yeai,
if the bonds had not been postponed, would have
been about sixteen million dollars Those of the
piesent yeai, in the oidinaiy operation of the
laws, without the postponed bonds, will not prob-
ably exceed §13,000,000
By supposing a large increase of fifty per cent
in 1839, beyond the ordinary receipts for the last
year, thev would amount to between nineteen
and twenty millions, and would be laiger than
the receipts of 1835 Such an increase would be.
gieatei than in any pievious yeai of our histoiy,
not affected by commeicial íestrietions, foieign
wars, or impoitant changes in the tauff
Considenng that, under the piesent credits,
the duties actually paid within any calendai year
must be estimated chiefly on the impoits from the
1st of July preceding to the 1st of July in that
yeai, and that two biennial leductions in the
taiiffhave occurred since 1835, it is believed that
mneti en or twenty millions is an estimate suffi
ciently high for 1839
But as the receipts of late have depended, much
less than formerly, when credits were longer and
almost universal, on the amount of boid3 taken
in pievious years, the estimates must be much
moie conjectural, and intestine commotions, wars
in Euiope or on our own holders, fluctuations in
crops oi puces, and various other contingencies
in the enduing year, which cannot be foreseen or
computed, may vary the result several millions
The íedueed reenpts both from lands and du-
ties in 1837 and 1838, as compared with the two
piecedmg years, weie anticipated by the Depatt-
ment m 1836, and a permanent provision to race!
any deficiency was eai nestly urged on tlie consid-
eration of Congress
Confident as were the expectations entertained
by many that the revenue of 1837 would be so
great as to justify further large deposits with the
States, and severe as were the censures bestowed
on those who expressed apprehensions of a dif
ferent result, a striking diminution in the revenue
actually occurred Although any difference of
opinion on a point of so much importance to the
public faith was deeply regietted by the Depart
ment, yet it felt constrained, at that time, to re
gard many appearances of extiaordmaiy pros
penty as delusive, the existing surplus as tem-
porary and fallacious in its character, and conse-
quently believed that much of it was likely to be
required in a few years to meet deficiencies in the
revenue, ansing from the progressive reduction
of the tariff, and those fluctuations m income and
expendituie to which all goveinments are moie
or less subject, and to which our own system of
finance is peculiarly exposed
Apart fiom the contingencies of war, and other
exi„enues affecting expenditure, it is impossible,
under the ebbs and floods of trade and specula-
tions of all kinds, which, with the present bank-
ing system, are as certain though not so regular
as the tides, that a revenue derived chiefly from
foreign importations and the sales of land, should
not vibiate with such changes The Department,
theiefoie, has discharged a duty deemed imper-
ative, in urging on the attention of Congress, at
several sessions, some permanent and efficient
arrangement for enabling the Treasury to meet
such fluctuations without injury to the public
credit
On one occasion, permanent legislation in re
speet to this point did take place But that has
been íepealed, or indefinitely postponed by the
act of October 12, 1837 and the temporary meas-
ures substituted having nearly ceased then op-
eration, the necessity for some further provision
is apparent The form seems to be the great
question of difficulty, there being, it is appre-
hended, a general concurrence of views in favor
of having some effectual piovision on a subject
of such obvious importance
The investment of a part of the surplus in the
Treasuiy in State stocks, in the manner which
foi several years has been successfully practiced,
under the acts of Congress, as to laige sums be-
longing to the Indians, so as to constitute a prov-
ident fund to meet contingencies and fluctuations,
was the mode flist íecommended by the Depart-
ment But a substitute for this plan was pre
ftrred by Congress, which direcud the whole
sjiplus to be deposited with the States for safe-
keeping, and enabled the Secretary of the Treas
uiy to recdll it, whenevei needed for public pur
poses In the autumn of 1837, however, when
the necessity of resorting to this substitute was
in view, Congie«s postponed its operation In-
stead of it, the power to issue Treasury notes for
a limited penod was gianted, and for additional
security against deficiencies, the deposit of the
fourth installment with the States, was deferred
till next January, and afterwaids the power to
sell the bonds of the United States Bank was
added But both of those powers will soon be
inoperative, and without some fuither legislation
on this subject, which shall be of an efficient
chaiacter, and be available at an early day, the
preseivation of the public fpith must be endan
geied
Recent experience is full of admonition on this
question Si nee the extinguishment of the national
debt and especially within the last thite years, it
has been the policy of Congiess to avoid a laige
balance in the Treasury immediately available,
which, if unemployed for the public set vice, w*
regarded as taken fiom the circulation of the
country, and in some degiee hoarded, though
deposited in banks which had made the public
money the basis of enlarged operations This
policy, as it obviates the hazard attending such
operations, as well as the imputation of improper
influence in the management of the money, is cer
tamly the most prudent But the preservation of
the public faiih, either under the foimer practice
of keeping the money in banks, or under the pro-
posed system of an Independent Treasuiy, may
occasionally render other resources necessary,
from the considerable fluctuations which are fie
quently occurring in our receipts and expenditures
from year to year, and even from month to month
Thus, the receipts from the usual sources, which
were, in 1834, about twenty one millions, rose
unexpectedly in 1836 to 848,000,000, but fell again
as suddenly in 1837 to only about nineteen mil-
lions So the aggregate expenditures in 1834 and
1835, independent of any payments for trusts or
the national debt, were only seventeen or eighteen
millions, but from Indian wars and other causes
they rapidly rose, and, notwithstanding the dim-
inution m receipts, have remained since not far
from thirty millions yearly Again, in the month
of January last, the expenditures were only about
one million eight hundred thousand dollars, and
in May last only $2,242,000, but m July they
suddenly increased to over four million five hun-
dred thousand dollars, being an excess, in a single
month, of nearly two and a third millions, or
more than enough to sweep off m thirty days the
whole balance on band Consequently, at any
period, with only a million or two in the Treas-
ury, and the current receipts being less than two
millions monthly, it is obvious that the public
engagements could not all be punctually met,
unless some power, like those befoie named, shall
exist, to provide for calls so unequal m different
portions of the year, as well as in different years
Though the receipts for any one year may be
equal to the whole expenditures within it, even
that will not remove the difficulty The expendi-
tures may be required in larger proportions in the
first half of the year, and the greatest receipts
occur in the last half.
Having the power to issue Treasury notes
during 1838, the Department has been enabled, by
the aid of that and other means, to meet every
authonzed engagement with punctuality A
power of a similar kind has been found in other
countiies, during more than a century, to be in-
dispensable to sustain public credit If we keep
only a small available balance in the Treasury,
and realize only the comparatively small income
which is desirable since the dischaige of the na-
tional debt, and this income shall continue to be
affected by the periodical fluctuations of receipts
which are probable under the changes going on
in the tariff, as well as in banking and the habits
of trade, this powei, or some equivalent resource,
seems to be essential to the support of the public
faith in the scrupulous manner required by jus-
tice and sound policy
The estimates of expenditures in 1839 have
been formed on the most economical basis which
the different Departments think the public inter-
ests will permit They are less than those of
either of the two preceding years, under many
heads, and are several millions less than either
the appropriations made by Congress in those
yeais, or the expendituies actually paid within
them Judging fiom past experience alone, the
probabilities would be that the appropriations to
be made at the present session will exceed, by
some millions, the estimates submitted
But such additional appropriations, to any con-
siderable extent, are not anticipated when the
whole circumstances of the country, and of the
Tieasury, shall have been calmly reviewed by
Congress ]N o doubt exists with the undersigned
that prudence, at this time, requires a reduction,
rather than an increase, in the aggregate of the
annua! appropriations Besides what is dictated
on this subject by a wisepubhcfrugality,and the
straitened condition of the Treasury, it is prob-
able thai, by the gradual reduction in the tariff,
v\ Inch is in p> ogress under the existing laws, the
receipts fiom customs, which now average six-
teen or seventeen millions yearly, will, by 1842,
be so far diminished as not then to exceed tenor
twelve millions Henee, if the annual expenses
do not by that pel lod undergo a reduction in some
degree loirtspondmg, so as not to surpass that
sum and the few additional millions which may
then be deuved from the siles of the public lands,
an unpleasant res ">rt to another increase of the
tanft oi to a recall of deposits with the States, or
to permanent loans, will then, if not sooner, be-
come indispensable
The further details connected with the diminu-
tion m our revenue by 1842, under the existing
laws, were so fully exhibited in the annual report
in 183o, that the undersigned forbears, on this
occasion, to repeat them But in commencing
the unpleasant task of reduction in the expendí-
