LOUISVILLE, February 6, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

Do you say send the brigade up the Cumberland River to land near Dover? Is not the enemy in possession of the route across from Dover? Please describe Grant's position and the enemy's.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.

FEBRUARY 6, 1862.

General GEORGE H. THOMAS, Somerset:

Move your division with all possible dispatch back to Lebanon. Further orders will meet you there. Leave one regiment to collect and guard the public property until relieved by one from Wood's brigade, and then join you.

Lose no time. What amount of property and provisions is there on hand? What means have you prepared for crossing the river?

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

FEBRUARY 6, 1862-7 p.m.

Gov. DAVID TOD, Columbus, Ohio:

General McClellan telegraphs, me that you have six regiments subject to my call. Please arrange them in two brigades, so as to place the most capable colonel in command in each as far as relative rank will permit, and move them with all possible dispatch to such points as General Halleck may designate. They should be supplied with ammunition-at least 40 rounds.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SOMERSET, February 6, 1862-11 p.m.

General D. C. BUELL:

Have on hand nearly 100,000 rations of small stores; not more than five days of bread.

Have been able to move but little of the captured property in consequence of the heavy and continuous rains. There are four ferry-boats being built, but none finished. A coal-boat is now used for crossing.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION,Calhoun, February 6, 1862.

Captain J. B. FRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Your telegram ordering my command back to this place also directed me to have Hawkins' brigade in readiness to move to Louisville. I suppose that you intended the Fourteenth Brigade, and wrote Hawkins instead of Jones, who is in command of this brigade.
