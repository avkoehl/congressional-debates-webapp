followed the railroad some distance. Three or four bridges were burned by the rebels, one of which was over Goose Creek, above Piedmont. I found the country very rugged and mountainous. A body of about 125 rebel cavalry fled from Piedmont as soon as we came within sight. No other troops were visible.

I extended my tour through the mountainous region toward the river, passing through Paris. I found everything perfectly quiet, and a general expression of sympathy for the cause of the Union in many places.

At Piedmont I learned from a man formerly of Pittsburgh, Pa., that it is generally conceded that Jackson's force on the other side of the river does not exceed 5,000 men besides Ashby's cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
