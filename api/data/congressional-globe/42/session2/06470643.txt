to United States gold currency.

I have before me a detailed statement of the
capital and working expenses, which are in-
cluded in and make up statement No. 5, fully
corroborating the statements made in regard to
them in the letter of Mr. Prescott; but I omit
them, as they are too long to be inserted as
part of these remarks. On the 18th day of
December, 1S71, the following editorial article
appeared in the New York Tribune :
" The Postal Tdeqraph.—^Jlv. Crcswcll, in his argu-
ment for tin- consolidation of the telegraph system
with the post ofhee, relies chiefly upon the experi-
ence ot GreatBritam, where, if hisstatemeutarecor-
rect, the Govcrnmenthasdorived fromits telegraphs
in the first year of the new system a net revenue of
more than three million dollars. If that were true, it
would be no rule for u^. Great Britain is a compact
little manufacturing inland, where the lines are short
and the ratio of messagf s to the whole population is
very high. The Brifiah figures quoted by Mi. Cres-
weli represent an annual transmission of about
thirteen million messages, exclusive of the volumin-
ousnewsdispatchcstothepres.;: whilein the United ■
States two years ago, with a population nearly one
third greater than that of the United Kingdom, the
whole number of messages was about the same.
Considering the enormous length of our lines, and
our vast urea of agricultural country in which there
cannot be a very general popular use of the tele-
graph, it is evident that the system would he far
more expensive in America than it is in Europe.
"But Mr. Creswell's statement of the pecuniary
result of the consolidation in Engla.nd is not correct,
lie quotes from 'the official report of Hon. (he is not
an honorable) George Chetwynd, receiver and ac-
countant general of the British office,' to show the
receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year onding
March 31,1871, and gives the following figures: gross
receipts, £971,215 13$. 11 id.; payments out, £273,281
I 17/?. Sir/.; net produce, £697,933169. 8d., or $3,391,954.
Now wc have before us the official statement of Mr.
Chetwynd of the income and expenditure of the
postal telegraphs, not for the liscal year, but for the
fourteen months ending March 31, 1871, and an
accompanying report to the chancellor of the ex-
chequer, by Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore, secretary to
the post office; and both these documents tell a very
different story from the one with which Mr. Crcswcll \
favors us. It appears from Mr. Chetwynd's report
that the gross receipts of the fourteen months_wcrc
£1,068,585, from which must be deducted £270.005
paid to submarine telegraph companies in respect
of collections on their behalf, and allowed to post-
masters and others for delivery of messages and
refunded message money. This is evidently the
item of'payments out/which Mr. Crcsweilt com-
mitted the extraordinary blunder of supposing to
be the gross expenditure; and the residuary £798,580
represents, not the net profit, but the gross revenue!
Mr. Croswell, in short, has not. got at the expend-
iture at all.
"What the cost of working the lines has been
is not clear from the British reports, The whole
outlay, exclusive of payments to the companies
whose lines were purchased, amounted to no less
than £1,397,389 ; but a part of this is fairly chargea-
ble to capital account. Mr. Chetwynd estimates tho
actual working expanses at £470,495, and charges the
remainder, £926,894, to capital expenditure. But
this is a deceptive classification. Undercapital ex-
penditure he places not only the cost of extensions,
amounting, as well as wc can make it out, to £178,933,
but all manner of outlay upon the plant, (such as
the very important item of maintenance and repair,
tor which the Western Union Company in America
spends $1,000,000 a year,) £177,094 for engineering,
salaries, wages, traveling, and other expenses,
which we should ccrtainly charge to current ex-
penditure, and the money spent for 4 preliminary
instruction'and'bonuses to learners.' If wereier
these and various other items to tho heads under
whieh they really belong, we shall find the expense
of the British postal telegraph system during four-
teen months to be £1,218,456, and the income £798,-
580, leaving a deficiency of £419,876. That would be
equivalent to a loss of SI,749,091 a year (in gold,)
insteadof the magnificent" net produce 1 of $3,391-
951 discovered by Mr. Creswcll. What confidence
can we place in our Postmaster General's reasoning
when he has erred so egregiously respecting his
facts
It will thus be seen, as I asserted in tin*
opening of these remarks, that the Postmaster
General is either wholly ignorant of the tacts
as to which he proposes to enlighten Congress
and the country, or he is trying to deceive both
foi the purpose of obtaining additional power
and patronage. I regard the latter as more
probable than the former. He has too nmch
Fense not to know that it is and always will
