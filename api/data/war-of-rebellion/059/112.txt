Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

Scout in from Demopolis; left a week ago last Friday. French's and Loring's divisions were there; they came through Selma; only small force there. The two regiments of infantry at Mount Hope (one from Loring's division) went there for purpose of letting re-enlisted men visit their homes. Says it was currently reported at Demopolis that Forrest, Lee, and Jackson had been ordered north, but did not know to what point.
