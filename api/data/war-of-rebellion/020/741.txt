HEADQUARTERS JAMES ISLAND AND THE MAIN,Charleston, S. C., January 3, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that in obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 252, department headquarters, I proceeded, in charge of the Forty-sixth Georgia Volunteers and Twenty-fifth South Carolina Volunteers, to Wilmington, N. C., and upon my arrival reported to Brigadier General W. H. C. Whiting, in command at that place. The troops ordered to report to me from the different districts in this department continued to arrive until the 19th ultimo, being delayed on account of insufficient railroad transportation. I would respectfully ask the attention of the general commanding to the inclosed memorandum of my assistant adjutant-general as to the arrival and departure of troops sent to Wilmington, and in this connection would remark that the delays were occasioned by overlaying the trains, by the worn-out condition of the locomotives, want of wood and water at proper stations, and want of system in running the trains. I am convicted that to reliance can be placed upon the railroad for the transportation of troops to Wilmington in any reasonable time or from Wilmington to this city. Three days elapsed from the reception of my orders to return before a single train could be furnished, though General Whiting's chief quartermaster appeared to use every exertion to obtain transportation. My orders to return were received on the morning of the 27th December last, and at this time not more than one-half of the troops, say 2,500 men, have reached this city.

The inefficiency of the railroads, as at present managed, is so apparent and manifest, that I feel constrained to remark that if re-enforcement to the number of 5,000 or more should at any time be required from this department for the defense of Wilmington they cannot be placed in position in less than five days unless changes are made in the regulations of railroad transportation. Such delays of course would result if re-enforcement were required for this city also.

The commanding general might well hesitate to sen away the whole or any portion of his movable force when the delays consequent upon insufficient transportation make it uncertain when these troops could be returned to him. I would respectfully suggest that the master be examined into and that the evils be remedied as far as may be possible;
