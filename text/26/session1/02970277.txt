12, nays 22
Mr NORVELL proposed a new section to the hill, making
appropriations for the further prosecution of the improvement
of all the roads, rivers, and harbors, which have been heretofore
commenced by the General Government
Mr N said that the proposed amendment embraced appro-
priations for works already begun, and that these appropria-
tions were founded upon estimates communicated to Congress,
in the early part of this session, by the War Department
He had omitted two items for light houses, because they
properly belonged to another bill, which, it was probable,
would, in a short time, be reported to ihe Senate by the Com-
mit ec on Commerce, of which he had the honor to be a mem-
ber He was fully aware that the Treasury was in an ex
hausted condition, and he would, under these circumstances,
however reluctantly, consent to defer at least some of those ap-
propriations, if the t umberland road bill were not press-
ed upon us But if we had to borrow five millions of
dollars, or to anthonze the issue of that sum m Treasury
notes, to enable us to go on with that expensive work, and to
replenish the exchequer for other purposes, he thought that it
would, be equally right «ad proper to borrow or issue ten roil,
lions, instead of five, to enable us to improve the harbors, rivers
and roads in other Slates, for the completion of which he con-
sidered the faith of the Government more evidently pledged
than lor that of the Cumberland road The former works were
commenced, and tobe continued out of the general funds in tha
Treasury The Cumberland road was to be made out of a spe-
cial fund, which had been run out long since. He desired that
the amendment might be printed, In order that the Senate
sh uld have an opportunity to examine it, and to see that it
conformed to official estimates made by the topographical and
military bureaus He appealed to the Senators from Indiana
and Illinois to permit this course to be taken, and to allow the
further consideration of the bill to be postponed until to-
morrow
After some remarks from Mr TAPPAN, Mr YOUNG, and
Mr SMITH of Indiana, m opposition to the motion for post-
ponement,
Mr NORVELL regretted that the Senator from Indiana [Mr
Smith] would not concur in the motion to postpone for a single
day, and to print the amendment The delay could not mate-
rially retard the progress of the bill, and would afford the Se-
nate an opportunity to give the whole subject a more mature
consideration He had not anticipated that the bill would coir e
up at this moment, and was not prepared to present the brief
views which he had intended to take of the bill and the amend-
ment The Senator from Indiana had pledged himself to vote
for the appropriations embraced in the amendment, if brougl t
up in a separate bill But did not the Senator perceive, did he
not know, that these appropriations, admitted by him to be so
important to Western interests, would fail, if detached from
those proposed for the Cumberland roadl It would be vain fe r
us to indulge in the delusion, or to affect to believe, that the
separation of the propositions, so naturally connected, could se
cure the success of both it might be fatal to that of either
The estimate for the Cumberland road had come to ua in the
same report, under the same head, in the same table, with the
estimates for the other roads, rivers, and harbors, for ihe com
pletion of which the amendment which he had submitted pro-
posed to make appropriations Why, then, should the Senate
select a single object, detach it from the others of kindred na
ture, and make it the favored and (a\ orite work for Government
patronage! Was this jusfl was it equall was it national?
How could such a course as this be reconciled with that princi-
ple of com promise, of equal and exact justice to all the States,
upon which the Federal Constitution was based? If, as alleged
by the Senator from Illinois, [Mr Youno.,] the Cumberland
road appropriations had always been kept separate and distinct
from others, of which he entertained great doubt, the practice
had been improper and unjust, and should be arrested How-
ever, without wishing to embarrass the bill by unnecessary de-
lay, he moved to postpone the further consideration of the sub-
ject until Thursday next, and to print the amendment
The question was then taken and decided in the affirmative—
ayes 20, noes 14.
So the further consideration of the bill was postponed until
Thursday next, and the bill and amendment were ordered to
be printed
TI e bill to provide for the payment of damages sgaiawed by
individuals by the wars with Indian tribes since 1830, was, ta-
ken up, and, after being debated by Messrs CLAY ofAjaharna,
HUBBARD, and GRUNDY, and several amendments  dopt-
ed, it was ordered to be printed
The bill more effectually to secure public money in the hands
of officers and agents of the Government, and to punish public
defaulters, was taken up, and, after seveial amendment were
adopted, it was informally passed over, and the Senate pro-
ceeded tothe consideration of Executive business
After which, the Fenate resumed the cdnsMeruion of the bill
grant ing a pension to Lemuel White, but before taking a ques-
tion thereon,

sent certain resolutions of the Legislature of Rhode Island in re-
lation to the public lands, which he had not been afforded an

tee, followed in reply to Mr Jenifer, and examined the resolu-
tions instructing the committee, and defined its duties under the
same, showing that, when the facts upon which the repon was
based shall be published, they will be a perfect justification of
its course; and will satisfy the House and the world that their
conduct has been in accordance with nght, and with truth and
justice He further maintained that, from the admission of the
