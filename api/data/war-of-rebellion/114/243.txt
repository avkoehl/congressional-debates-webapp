war only in the particular cases to which these provisions apply. In all cases not embraced in this statutory laws and not made triable by the courts which it creates we must recur to the general code of war and try by a military commission.

A military commission will be immediately ordered to assemble at La Mine cantonment for the trial of such prisoners as may be brought before it. You will furnish the judge-advocate with a copy of this letter for his guidance and will see that the charges and specifications are properly drawn up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, December 31, 1861.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD, Commanding, &amp;c.

GENERAL: I inclose a memorandum of information* received here respecting the principal persons who originated or encouraged the arson committed on the North Missouri Railroad, and also a communication from Mr. Clay Taylor,* who you will observe is one of the parties accused although he was not aware of that fact when he wrote. It is believed here that there is pretty good foundation for these charges. I wish you to get all the information on this subject you can and if you deem the evidence sufficient to justify it to arrest the parties. Do not let the contents of the memorandum be made public.

If General Prentiss has taken the command of your forces you will of course report this letter to him. I also wish the matter of Mr. Clay Taylor's complaint to be investigated and if injustice has been done him it must be repaired. I have had no information from you or General Prentiss for several days. Why is this?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, December 31, 1861.

Major General HENRY W. HALLECK.

DEAR SIR: Although not acquainted with you personally and therefore claiming no right to obtrude myself upon your attention yet as a citizen of Missouri sworn to support the Constitution of the United States and of this State and under legal obligation not only to sustain all lawful authority but also morally bound to do all that in my power lies to restrain authority within legal bounds, that all things may be done lawfully and in order so that the dread majesty of the law may be asserted as the supreme power in this land which all must obey, I cannot refrain from doing what in my power lies to support the Government and to keep to the path of duty. For this purpose I have labored for months past through the public press in addresses to my fellow citizens, &c., constantly endeavoring to induce all to take and maintain the ground that in all things the law is our only master, and that all wrongs, civil and political, must be remedied by and through the methods the law points out. Usurpation of power is no excuse for revolution against those whose right to office is of limited duration, nor is lynch law the proper remedy for crime.
