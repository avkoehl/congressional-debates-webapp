HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,December 8, 1864-5.45 a. m. (Received 6 a. m.)

General MOTT:

I wish you would have the head of your column ready to move on at daybreak. Move left in front and pass to the right of the train if you come to it. As soon as you reach that part of the railroad not destroyed I wish you to begin destroying it as thoroughly as possible.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that you move the trains at 3 a. m. through the woods to the large open field on the left of the road. Three batteries will precede the trains. General Mott has been instructed to move at daybreak to protect the trains and to look out for and be prepared for any movement of the enemy down this road.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CIRCULAR, HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 160. December 8, 1864-11.30 a. m.

General Gregg has reached the railroad and burnt the bridge across the Nottoway. He has had some skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry and has driven them all across that stream. Though he pickets all the roads coming in from our right, it will be best for each division commander to leave an infantry force, from 300 to 500 men, according to the importance of the roads, at each one of them to hold it until it is relieved by the following division, and General Mott until the last of his division has passed. The column should be moved on with as little rest as possible, and the stragglers can come in with the train.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
