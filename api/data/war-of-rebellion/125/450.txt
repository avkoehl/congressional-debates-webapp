PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., June 23, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In the report of a debate in the Senate on the 8th instant Senator Wilson is reported as saying that 'since the 17th day of October we have put 700,000 men into the field." On the 9th that "we have called since the 17th day of October last for 700,000 men," &amp;c.

These statements appear to have been made with a view to showing that large calls have been made for volunteers and filled by volunteering in a very short period of time, viz, 'since the 17th of October last," and thus to influence legislation in the matter of raising troops. As the statements without explanation may mislead some, I remark upon them as follows:

Previous to October 17, 1863, no call for troops had been made since July, 1862. The calls referred to by Senator Wilson, as their terms will show, were not for 700,000 men, to be furnished after "October 17," but included the ratification of accounts back to the calls of July, 1862.

I presume Senator Wilson based his assertions on tabular statements exhibiting the condition of the recruiting service, which are on file in my office. If so, he has perhaps not fully understood them. The statement that 'since the 17th of October we have put 700,000 men in the field" is not sustained by the records of my office. The fact is that since the 17th of October, 1863, about 300,000 white men have been mustered into the U. S. service. The number put in the field is somewhat less than this, on account of desertions, unavoidable discharges, &c., before getting into the field.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
