WARRENSBURG, July 26, 1864.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

Kansas City:

The order did not contemplate any movement at present, but that you should get your command in condition as soon as possible and hold them prepared to move at a moment's notice.

By order:

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAINT LOUIS, July 26, 1864.

General FISK:

There was no reproof or rebuke intended to you in my telegram with reference to the calling out of the Enrolled Missouri Militia. I do not doubt that the general authorized all you did, but unfortunately he scarcely had the power to do so. My object is to straighten the matter and put it on a basis which will secure the State of Missouri and the General Government from fraud or imposition in the way of after claims. All militia should be called into service by the Governor, upon formal requisition by the proper military commander. The department commander has no authority to call out militia in any other way. This formality should be observed, for otherwise all claims and accounts will be thrown out when brought before the auditors of the Treasury. I will furnish the copies of the letters and telegrams you desire, if your records do not have them. Since writing the above I have seen Captain Eno's dispatch of yesterday. It is not the intention in that dispatch to revoke any of your orders as to those troops which you have already called out, nor to direct you to disband any. My understanding of it is that you should report to these headquarters your needs of militia when you want them called out, and how many, to enable the commanding general to make the proper official requisition for them.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
