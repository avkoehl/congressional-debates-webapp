ntories," to take charge of all territorial business.

tion, as being entirely unnecessary, and Mr. BAG-
BYurged the propriety of its adoption, and called
for the yeas and nays thereon.

ditional committee be adopted; and he moved to lay

THE ADJOURNMENT OF CONGRESS.
On motion by Mr. EVANS, the Senate took up
for consideration the joint resolution for the adjourn-
ment of the two Houses of Congress sine die on
Monday, the 20th day of May next, at noon.
Mi. EVANS said it hod been suggested to him
that this resolution would be more acceptable if the
day fixed upon for adjournment were made some-
what later. He was anxious himself that it should
be as early as possible, but was willing to modify
the resolution so as to read, instead of "Monday, the
20th,11 "Monday, the 27th of May."
Mr. MERRICK observed that this would render
it necessaiy for Congress to be in session on Sun-
day.
Mr. EVANS said this had never occurred but
once. There was always, at the close of the ses-
sion, a great press of business before both Houses,
in the engrossment of bills, &c.; and it was a great
convenience to members to have a day of interval
and rest, before the adjournment took place.
Mr. SEVIER did not know exactly how he
could vote upon this resolution. He was very
anxious to get home as soon as he could; but there
were some very important questions, and amongst
them the tariff question, yet to be disposed of
