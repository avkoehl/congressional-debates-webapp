Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the Untied States:

GENERAL: Your communication of the 21st instant, by hands of Major Ord, was received last night. I will certainly move from here on Saturday morning, the 25th instant. I intended to go via Jones' Bridge and Charles City Court-House and sent a communication to you yesterday by Captain Sheridan to that effect. The road via Jones' Bridge and Charles City Point-House is good, and the difference in distance will only be about four miles, so that it will take about the same length
