GRENADA, March 1, 1863.

Colonel J. R. WADDY:

The following has been received this morning from the Boyce Place, Sunflower County, dated February 25, 1863:

We have scouts near the Pass and at Friar's Point. They report to-day that the boats have all gone back to Helena, it is supposed, to bring down this fleet. Scouts from Friar's Point report between twenty and thirty transports loaded with troops passed down two days since, and two or three boats loaded with wagons with them. We will have scouts on that section while we remain here, and will keep you and the officers on Tallahatchee advised as much as possible. I am afraid if we remain here much longer, we will not be able to get out on account of high water. The Mississippi River is rising rapidly.
