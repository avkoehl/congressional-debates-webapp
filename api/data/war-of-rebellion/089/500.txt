[Fourth indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 16, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

The commanding general desires to have from Major-General Gibbon a detailed report of the reasons which led him to regard the three regiments named in his order as unworthy to carry colors. The order of the commanding general was based solely on General Gibbon's order, presented to him simply for confirmation, and rested upon the presumption that it was considered that the cases of the three regiments specified afforded notable instances of bad conduct in action. As the order originated with Major-General Gibbon, the commanding general deems it proper that these papers should be referred to that officer for a minute report before being returned to the War Department.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
