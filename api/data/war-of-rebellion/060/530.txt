CUMBERLAND, February 6, 1864- 1. 30 p. m.

Colonel MULLIGAN, New Creek:

Do you propose to leave Colonel Thoburn to occupy Burlington! If so, direct him to keep out small infantry scouts, in the command of intelligent officers or non- commissioned officers, constantly in the mountains between him and the South Branch, and if possible to capture that infernal scoundrel Mike Kane and his gang. We must be more vigilant hereafter.

A movement commenced this morning at 9 o'clock. Shall strike Sunday morning at 5 o'clock. Keep up demonstration until after that time. Lee has but 25,000 troops. Perhaps it will do to press him on Sunday afternoon in earnest.
