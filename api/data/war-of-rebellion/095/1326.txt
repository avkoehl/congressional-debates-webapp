not been that a scout of West Virginia troops, under a Captain Allen, were prowling throwing the neighborhood of my route only a day ahead of me, robbing the people (I know of no other appropriate name to call it), under the pretense of gathering up United States property, it is very likely that I could have found many Government horses and other property; but the people, being warned of my approach, drove all horses to the mountains and concealed effectually all other property. I regret to say that this Captain Allen did not fall into my hands.

I returned after an absence of twelve days with my horses in better condition than when I left. The delay in forwarding this report is due to my serious illness since my return.

I am,sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. OWENS,

Colonel Eighth Ohio Cavalry Volunteers.
