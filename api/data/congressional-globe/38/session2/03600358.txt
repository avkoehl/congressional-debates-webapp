DEFICIENCY BILL.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to present a report
from the committee of conference on what is called
the deficiency bill. I ask that it be read, and then
I desire to submit a motion in regard to it.
The Secretary read, as follows:
The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of
the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the
bill of the House, No. 0V20, to supply deficiencies in the ap-
propriations for the service of the liseal year ending the
30th of June, 1865, having met, after full and free confer-
ence have been unable to agree.

GEORGE E. VEND LUTON,
EDWIN II. WEBSTER,
Managers on the pait of the House*
JOHN SHERMAN,
JOHN CONNESS,
CHARLES It. 1UJCKALEW,
Managers on the pait of the Senate,
There being 110 objection, the Senate proceeded
to consider the report. â€¢
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to submit a mo-
tion that the Senate insist upon its amendments
disagreed to by the House of Representatives,
and ask for another committee of conference.
Before that motion is put, I wisli to call the at-
tention of the Senate to the question of difference
on this bill, and I should like to have the atten-
tion of the Senate and a deliberate vote upon the
question between the two Houses. It is very
important that this bill should be passed to-day
or to-morrow. Many of the appropriations are
necessary for the support of the Army and Navy.
The bill contains an appropriation of over one
hundred million dollars, nearly all of which is for
the Army and Navy. The point of controversy
between the two Houses grows entirely out of
this clause of the deficiency bill:
To enable the Clerk of the House of Representatives to
execute tlie resolutions of the Hoine of" July 4, 186-1, dl-
rucling pavnufnt of additional compensation to its officers,
clerks, anil other einploy&s, and to the Ilou^e reporters for
the Congressional Globe, a sum sufficient for that pin pose,
being $37,991 40, is hereby appropriated out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and the same
is hereby added to the contingent fund of the House of
liepiesematives; but no payment shall bemadeuwler tills
provision to any oilier pctsons than the clerks, officers,
or other employes of the House, and the reporters for the
Congressional Globe.
The Senate struck out this clause containing
an appropriation for twenty per cent, extra com-
pensation to the employes of the House for the
, last session, by a unanimous vote of the Com-
mittee on Finance, and also by the unanimous
vote of the Senate, there being no discussion in
the Senate, however, and no vote by yeas and
nays. The House now insists that we shall
retain this provision in the deficiency bill. The
otheramendments of the Senate are not disagreed
to. Although they are not yet concurred in, there
is no disagreement in regard to any of them ex-
cept this one; and now we must treat the ques-
tion deliberately, whether or not we will consent
to the increase demanded by the House of twenty
per cent, to their employed for the last session.
The conferees on the partof the Houseinsist that
it is discourteous to the House to refuse to allow
them to make this appropriation^and they evince
some feeling on the subject. The appropriation
by the resolution of the 4th of July last is ad-
mitted to be illegal. They first proposed to pay
this $37,000 out of the contingent fund of the
House. The Clerk of the House of Representa-
tives refused to pay the money without the sanc-
tion of the Comptroller. The question was sub-
mitted to the Comptroller, and he refused to pass
the vouchers for the payment of this money. I
have before me the letter of the Comptroller, re-
ferring to the law on this subject, from which it
is perfectly clear that neither the House of Rep-
resentatives nor the Senate could provide for such
an appropriation as this without a law authoriz-
ing it.
Senators who have been here for some years
will remember the controversy about extra com-
pensation to the employes of the two Houses.
Prior to 1854 it was usual for both Houses to al-
low their employes twenty per cent, extra com-
pensation at the end of each session. In 1854,
however, the increase was made permanent, and
all further allowances of that kind were prohib-
ited by law. But subsequently, between 1854 and
1858, the custom again sprang up of allowing the
usual extra compensation of twenty per cent. In
1858, as it was supposed, Congress cut off all
pretense of that kind in either House by this pro-
vision:
"That no part of the appropriations which may at any
time be made lor the contingent expenses of either House
of Congress shall be applied to any other than the ordinary
expenditures ot the Senate and House of Representatives,
nor as extra allowance to any elurk, ine^enger, or attend-
ant o! the said two Honors, or either of them, nor as pay-
ment or compensation to any clerk, messenger, or other at-
tendant of the said two Houses, or either of them, unless
Mieh clerk, messenger, or other attendant be so employed
by a resolution of one of said Houses."
Under this law, no extra compensation has
been allowed to the employes of the two Houses
since 1858, and it was believed that this fifth sec-
tion cut off all power by either House to allow
extra compensation. When the House, however,
passed the resolution of last session, the question
was submitted to the Comptroller. lie quoted
this law and decided that he was not authorized
to pay the money demanded by the House of
Representatives, nnd he has refused to pny it.
Thereupon this provision was inserted in the de-
ficiency bill, to legalize the payment by the Comp-
troller, and the question is whether we shall as-
sent to it.
I may say on behalf of the Committee on Fi-
nance that we determined unanimously that we
would not approach the question of the increase
of the compensation in this way; that the House
had no more power to increase the pay of their
officers than the Senate, or the President, or the
Executive Departments. The law expressly for-
bids it, and expressly provides that the contin-
gent fund shall not be used for increasingthe pay
of the employes. The law is clear and plain.
We had to meet this question, therefore, not as
a question of privilege on the part of the House,
because the House had no power to raise the
compensation of their employes; but we had to
meet it as a question of policy, whether we will
now consent to increase the compensation of our
own employGs. Looking at the question in that
light, when we came to examine the pay of the
employes of the Senate and the House of Repre-
sentatives, we found that it was already higher
in proportion than the pay of corresponding offi-
cers in the Executive Departments. Besides that,
as the employes of the two Houses only work
during the session, and many of them are paid
for the whole year, they have that advantage over
the employes of the Executive Departments. We
therefore could not justify an extra allowance to
