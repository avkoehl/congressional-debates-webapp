HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,December 10, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing of interest has transpired along our lines during the past twenty-four hours. It is thought that the picket-line in front of Forts Davis and Alexander Hays has been weakened; also that new troops now occupy the enemy's line. No deserters have been reported since the three mentioned in my report of last night.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.

Two deserters from Twenty-fifth North Carolina just reported. Left their camp about 4 a.m. Report no change in their line. Know of no movement beyond the report of some of Early's men moving to our left. Don't know what amount of force.
