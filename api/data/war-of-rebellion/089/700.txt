HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, THIRD DIV., SECOND ARMY CORPS, November 24, 1864.

Major SEPTIMUS CARNCROSS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report of my tour of duty as corps officer of the duty from the 24th to the 25th instant:

I visited the greater portion of the line from Battery 5 to the left. There was some firing during the day from Battery 9 to Fort Morton. No firing from Fort Rice to the left. The firing is kept up very generally along the whole line during the night time. I found that two or three posts in front of Fort Stedman had been abandoned on account of the storm washing away the parapets. I instructed the division officer of the day of the Second Division to have the work repaired last evening. I would also recommend that plank be furnished for platforms for the guns in Fort Stedman. It was almost impossible to work the guns during the last storm. The orderly from the right of the line reports to me this morning that nothing unusual transpired on that portion of the line yesterday or last night.

Respectfully submitted.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
