HDQRS. FOURTH DIV., DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Martinsburg, January 11, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Commanding Department, Cumberland:

I have no news yet. Sent a reconnoitering party to Winchester last night. I have the country properly picketed and patrolled from North Mountain to the Opequon. I do not think, judging from what I have seen and heard, that this section has ever been thoroughly and properly picketed, which may account for occasional surprises.
