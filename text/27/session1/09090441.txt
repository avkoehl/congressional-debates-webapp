mg West, I am the more forcibly reminded of the decay of my

the land of my na ivity and my home, bettei than any legion

the new States, but we insist that, m distributing your bles

the horn of peril We askfor nothing but an equally of be
nefits, as we have to iear an equality of hardens Andas the
lands were first ceded far the purpose of "testotmg haimony"
as well as paying off the Revolutionary debt, we now insist,
foi the purpose of restoring harmony on this vexed question,
that thev shall be disposed of for ihe common use and benefit

Mr Chauman, by what principle of justice is it that the new
¡states sh mid be so highly favored by this Government, by
heavy and constant donations of this laud, and the old States
should rece ve none? It is around the old States that cluster
all the associations of our ea>ly histoiy and of our nvional
origin Ti e old States constituted die nucleus of the V¡\ o ,
they fought the battles of the llevo ution ihey furnished tr e
heroes and sages of that trying period, whobe bones now lie
inhumed in their soil They iirst gave you a pottion of the
lands, and afteiwards purchased other? with their common
ueasure \ndwill the new State , can they, forget all this,
andreiuse to the old States a poitionof the benefits ansmg

treat the old States as children treat then j aients in some

This bill has been objected to—and the point has been strongly
urged by the gentleman from Vn^iuia, [Mi Wise,] on the
ground that it was a vinual assumption by this Government of
the debts of the seveia1 fetates How can this charge be se-
riously made! I know of no Inend of this bUl heie, no, jiot
one, who advocates such assumption Does not the bill leave
the States free to apply their quotas "to any use or purpo?e"
which the> in their judgment may think proper? Are nooebf
the States to receive then distubutive shares, except thosetbat
are in d"bt? North Caiohna owes nn debt—she w therefore the
more fortunate m being able to apply bershaie to improving
her channels of commeice; reirovug the obstructions, which
gird her seacoast, uniting her eastern and western borders,
bringing down the products of her mountain fo her Atlantic
depots, and in preventing the productions of her soil from being
transported to other States to enrich other communities which
feel no sympathies m common with her She wants her share
to enable her to educate her children, to peifect her systern of
common schools, which she is j«st carrying into operation; and
thus burg to her service all the native intellect withm her li-
re it& She wants it to enable her to complete the draining of
her millions of acres of swamp lands, to convert these waste
morasses into fertile fields, and thus offer to her enterprising
ci i?ens some mducem^rt to remain on their native soil instead
off migrating to the dis'ant West
1 nib bill contemplates no assumption of bta'e debts. It, la
true, it leave  to the State* the richt to appiopriate their shares
to the pajment of their deotg if tl ey owe any, and to that ex-
tent it will relieve their cit z n  fiom the payment of taxes, to
discha^g* the annual m'erest on tbo-e debt* Whether the
States acted wisely or unwisely in memiirg debts, is not the
quest un we have to decide Whethei they apply their shares
of the pioceeds of the lands to in ernal improvement, to educa*
tion, oi to the r aj ment of their debt?, is a matter for their own
soveieign consideration No State Righis mancan question
then light to dispose of it as they think proper But, sir, rs
not this Distiibution bill the best system that can be devised to
preven the assumption of the State debts bv t]&js Government?
U not this id a of assumption beginning to gain favor m those
States that are heavily in debt? I et this doctr ne once be openly
avowed and advocated by those seeking pepulai favor, and it
wil sweep away eveij obstacle m its progresb m those States
that a'-e heavilj m uebt It will produce a harvest of dema-
