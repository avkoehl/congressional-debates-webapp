Dispatches sent by your aide to the effect that the enemy have the Orange plank road nearly to the intersection of the Brock road. Getty is there, but not strong enough to attack. Attack them; Getty will aid you. Griffin has been pushed back by the enemy somewhat on the Orange Court-House pike. Warren's left, General Crawford, was within a mile of Parker's Store, but he may be drawn in or be driven in. Push out on the plank road and connect with Warren.
