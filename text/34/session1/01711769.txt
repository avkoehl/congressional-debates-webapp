to it.
J^r. RUST. I object to it, whether you strike
out that matter or not.
REPORT FROM COMMITTEE, ETC.
Mr. FAULKNER, by unanimous consent, re-
ported back from the Committee on Military
Affairs, House bill (No. 240) for the relief of the
officers and privates of the Clinton Guards, in the
county of Macomb, in the State of Michigan;
which was referred to a Committee of the Whole
House, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. MATTESON. I ask that the title of bill
No. 332, reported to-day from the Committee
of the Whole House, and which has been passed,
be amended so as to conform to the bill. It is the
bill for the relief of William Jones.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. What is the title
now ?
Mr. MATTESON. It is " A bill for the relief
of William Jones." The amendment which I
propose is, to make the title, " A bill for the relief
of Calvin Hall, assignee of William Jones."
The question was taken; and the title was
amended; and the title, as amended, was agreed to.
Mr. QUITMAN. One of the bills to-day has
been objected to on some technical point, and I
believe there is no valid objection to it. I speak
of bill (H. R. No. 243) for the relief of George
K. McGunnegle, surviving partner of the late
firm of Hill & McGunnegle, of St. Louis, Mis-
souri. I believe that the objection to it will be
withdrawn now: and I move to discharge the
Committee of the Whole House from its further
consideration.
COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. I move that the
rules be suspended, and that the House resolve
itself into the Committee of Whole on the state
of the Union, with a view to holding an evening
session.
The motion was agreed to.
The rules were accordingly suspended; and the
House resolved itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Haven
jn the chair,) the fortification bill being under
consideration.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I move that the committee
take a recess until seven o'clock this evening.
The motion was agreed to; and the committee
(at four o'clock and thirty minutes, p. m.) took a
recess tillseven o'clock p. m.
EVENING SESSION.
The Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union reassembled at seven o'clock, p. m.,
(Mr. Haven in the chair,) the fortification 4)ill
being under consideration, on which Mr. Jew-
ett was entitled to the floor.
Mr. CRAWFORD (Mr. Jewett having yield-
ed the floor) expressed his views in relation to the
slavery question, and to the Missouri compro-
mise, to which he argued the North was never
faithful, unless when it suited its own interests.
Mr. JEWETT resumed the floor, and reviewed
the state of politics in the country, particularly
criticising the Know Nothing party, and con-'
demning its prescriptive principles. *
Mr. COX replied to his colleague, [Mr. Jew-
ett,] and defended the Know Nothing, or Amer-
ican party. In the course of his remarks he
alluded to the presidential contest, and particu-
larly to the position of Mr. Buchanan.
A debate upon the general politics of the coun-
try, and the position of the presidential can-
didates, ensued, in which Messrs. Barksdale,
Reade, Houston, and Cox, participated.
The speeches will be published m the Appendix.
Mr. TALBOTT stated that he intended to re-
ply to his colleague, [Mr. Cox,] but would seek
an opportunity to do so to-morrow evening, or
on some future occasion.
Mr. LETCHER obtained the floor; but yielded
it to
Mr. A. K. MARSHALL, who moved that the
committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Haven reported that the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
had, according to order, had the Union generally
under consideration, and particularly the fortifi-
cation bill, and had come to no resolution thereon.
And then, on motion of Mr. JEWETT, (at nine
o'clock and fifty-five minutes,) the House ad-

stant, for the relief of Francis A. Gibbons and
Francis X. Kelly, with the opinion of the court

entire approbation of the Committee on Claims.

remark that, as the session is drawing to a close,
