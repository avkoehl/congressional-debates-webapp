THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 12,
Mr. CHANDLER. Does the gentleman mean
to say that where debts have been recognized by
the Indians they aie not to be paid ?
Mr. HOUSTON. This provision was offered
by the gentleman from South Carolina, and it was.
intended to put down the fraudulent and corrupt
practice which has prevailed in this city and every-
where else tfhere Indians are managed at all on
the'part of white men, of making contracts with
Indians and defrauding them out of their dues.
Let me illustrate the case. An Indian is entitled
to an annuity and a compensation from the Gov-
ernment under some treaty, and^sorne white man,
an Indian agent, goes to him and tells him that he
cannot get his pay without the instrumentality of
some white man, that Congress will not pay any
attention to him; and he thus induces him to give
him a large amount, sometimes a quarter, some-
times a half, and in some cases more than half.
The gentleman from Florida [Mr. Cabell] is bet-
ter acquainted with these things than I am, and he
knows that often, for really no service at all, the
Indian is deprived of more than half his money
by these kind of agents or attorneys.
Mr. CHANDLER. I am concerned to know
if an Indian trader purchases goods in the East
and sells them to the Indians upon credit, is to lose
his debts?
Mr. HOUSTON. That has nothing to do with
it.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. I will make a
brief explanation in regard to this matter, if the
gentleman will allow me. An amendment was
drawn up by the gentleman from South Carolina,
[Mr. Woodward.] I was consulted with arid
satisfied, at the time, that it was correct, and
would hereafter relieve a class of cases where the
Indians themselves were the sufferers from an im-
putation which existed most unfairlyagainstthem
in the minds of gentlemen, ^nd that it would place
them upon their own merits before the House, and
that it would enable them to be properly cared for
and sustained here. I am entirely satisfied, that the
amendment proposed by the Senate will materially
change the section which was originally adopted
by the House. 1 believe that the best thing which
can be done for the benefit of these Indians, is to
place them in this position, where they can em-
ploy th^ir own agents if they choose, and pay
them themselves, and where the Government will
have nothing to do with these agents. Or, in
other words, will not recognize any contract be-
tween them and the Indians, but leave them to be
governed by Indian law; and in their transactions
with the Indians to receive what they may choose
to give them. We will have nothing to do with
their business at all. This will enable them to
get justice, whereas they cannot get it unless a
course of this kind is taken. I am opposed to the
amendment, and T agree with the chairmanvof the
Committee on Ways and Means not to concur in
the amendment of the Senate.
Mr. SEYMOUR, of New York. Mr. Chair-
man, I wish to say a few words 
The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will report the
next amendment, and then the gentleman will be
heard.
The amendment was then read, as follows;
" Section 3, page 21. line 12, nfter the woid " contract,"
inseit the words (i hereafter made.*'
Mr. SEYMOUR. I wish to inquire of the
Committee of Ways and Means, whether it is the
intention to have the expression which was insert-
ed m the House bill apply to contracts which had
previously been made between these Indians 5nd
other persons, in good faith, and whether the ac-
tion of the Senate has not been merely to restrict
it to subsequent contracts? It seems to me, if this
is so, that then the action of the Senate is right,
and we should agree in their amendment, and the
word " hereafter" should stand where they put it,
and not where the committee of the House put it.
I do not think we are prepared to say that con-
tracts which have been made in good faith be-
tween these Indians and agents, for the purpose of
getting their money or any other thing, shall be
abrogated. I will not prejudge them. They have
been made in good faith; they ought to stand to
them. All that should be done by any law in this
matter, should apply to future contracts, that all
persons in future may have notice of it. No such
law has existed heretofore, and if contracts have
been made m good faith between these Indians
and their agents, they should not be embarrassed
by any provision like this.
Mr. WOODWARD. Mr. Chairman, if the
principle of the amendment proposed by me when
the bill was first before the House, and which has
been stricken out or modified, by the Senate, be
correct, there is no good reason why it should not
apply to existing contracts, as well as those here-
after to be made. The Senate must have miscon-
ceived the nature of the provision. It will not
operate to make void existing contracts between
Indians and white men, or to prohibit such con-
tracts in future. Nor does it propose to take from
the white man acting as the agent of an Indian or
tribe of Indians, any remedy he may be entitled
to by law, for breach of contract by the Indians.
It simply proposes to prohibit executive officers
from assuming to exercisejudicial functions in
such cases, between the agent and the Indian.
Your executive officers cannot lawfully practice
such jurisdiction, and what the Constitution and
the laws have denied them, a white man and an
Indian cannot by contract confer upon them.
Besides the usurpation, there is the grossest in-
justice and inequality in this executive judicature.
It is exerted for the exclusive benefit of the white
man, and always to the disadvantage of the In-
dian. It is not an equity jurisdiction to enjoin
what is fair, and just, and reasonable between the
parties. Its object is to hold the Indian to his
bargain no matter how grossly he may have been
imposed upon; and this, too, without any consid-
eration of the real value of the services of the
agent, or whether he was either faithful or skill-
ful in performing them.
Your Departments assume to pronounce judg-
ment against the Indian, and then to execute their
own judgment. Why should they desire to be
permitted to do this? And what should it matter
whether the contract be already made, or be Here-
after to be made ?
The Senate appear to have supposed that the
Erovision as applied to existing contracts, would
e in the nature of an.io? post/ado law. This is a
great mistake. The agent is left to his remedy in
the courts of the country, or the courts of the In-
dian tribes. And he who trusts an Indian, espe-
cially he who cheats an Indian, has no right to
complain that the laws have not provided a pecu-
liar and extraordinary jurisdiction for his special
benefit.
It is a suspicious circumstance, that influences
have been exerted to exempt existing contracts
from the operation of the provision. I fear there
is something wrong.
Mr. WALSH. Is it in order to discuss this
matter?
The CHAIRMAN. Further discussion is not
in order.
Mr. WALSH. When this original proposi-
tion was submitted to the House, 1 objected to it
as violating vested rights. With the indulgence
of the committee, I will repeat the reasons which
I suggested then.
[Cries of "Order!" "Order!" " Order !,v]
Mr. WALSH. All I have to say is, that is a
most extraordinary state of facts that three or four
gentlemen have been discussing this matter upon
one side 
[Loud cries of " Order!"]
The question was then taken upon disagreeing
to the Senate amendment, and it was decided in
the affirmative. â€¢
So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. PHELPS. I wish to inquire if theamend-
ment was adopted or rejected ?
The CHAIRMAN. The question was put
upon disagreeing to the Senate amendment, and it
was decided in the affirmative.
Mr. EVANS moved that the committee rise.
Mr. HOUSTON. Oh, no; let us get through
with the hill.
The question was then taken upon Mr. Evans's
motion, and it was decided m the negative.
So tin1 committee refused to rise.
The twenty-sixth amendment of the Senate was
read, as follows:
<{Sec. 4. rfnd be it further enacted, That no estimate or
appropriation of money, in any bill making appropriations,
shall authorize the payment of any increased pay. allow-
ance, or eompensat'on m any form whatever beyond the
amount prescribed by law, in any case, unless there shall
first be a specific direction for such extra payment, desig-
nating the officers to wliom such extia payment shall be
made."
Mr. JOHNSON, of Georgia. I move to strike
out that clause on the ground that that is already
the law. None of these officers have the power
to appropriate any money, or apply it in any way,
unless authorized by law. _
The question was then taken upon Mr. John-
son's motion, and it was not agreed to.
The question recuri ed upon concurring in the
Senate amendment, and being put, it was decided
in the affirmative.
So the amendment was concurred in.
Section five, being the twenty-sixth amendment
of the Senate, coming up next in order, was read,
considered, and agreed to, as follows:
" Sec. 5. Jind be it further enacted, That the Commis-
sioner of Public Buildings be, and he is hereby, authorized
to apply any unexpended portion of the money appropri-
ated by the act of Congress entitled ' An act making appio-
priation to meet the expenses incurred in consequence of
the late fire, at the Capitol,' approved January 13th, 1852, to
the payment of expenses necessarily incurred in repairing
the.damage lately done by fire in the office of the clerk of
the Supreme Court, and in making other repairs about the
Capitol."
The Clerk then read the sixth section, being the
last of the Senate amendments, as follows:
"Sec. 6. Jlndbe it further enacted. That the Secretary
of the Treasury be. and he is hereby authorized to purchase
for the United States a suitable piece of ground at a central
point in the city of San Francisco, California, as a site for
the erection of the custom-house heretofore authorized to
be built: Provided, That said site or ground may be ob-
tained with good and sufficient title to the United States
in exchange for such reasonable noition of the Government
reserve in that city as the said Secretary shall deem just and
equitable, or for a sum in lieu thereof not exceeding $40,000 ;
and to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to* carry into
effect this provision, the sum of $40,000 is hereby appro-
priated: Provided, That if the said Secietary shall fail to
obtain such ground on satisfactory terms, then the said sum,
or such portion thereof as may be necessary, may be ex-
pended in providing the proper foundations for sajd custom-
house on the site heretofore selected for the purpose."
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I move to
strike out the last proviso. I do not understand
it, and I should like to have some explanation of
it. I do not understand why Â§40,000 are to be
appropriated to laying the foundation of the cus-
tom-house at the site already selected, in case they
cannot get another site. I understand that the
contract is made for building that custom-house.
We have here $40,000 to be appropriated and
spent in laying new foundations for a house that
is already contracted for in case they cannot find
a new site.
Mr. McCORKLE. There is but one explana-
tion to give of it, which is this: The lands owned
in San Francisco by the United States are what
are called water-lands. The point selected upon
which to erect this custom-house had, about a
year ago, eight feet of water upon it, and about
thirty feet,of mud under that water. It is esti-
mated that it would cost at least $40,000 to put a
proper foundation there for the custom-house,
which would have to be done by piling and fill-
ing in. If, however, it becomes necessary to pur-
chase another piece of ground, this money in that
instance, instead of being applied for piling and
filling a foundation, will be appropriated for the
purchase of another site. That is the object of
this proviso. In case a more eligible position
cannot be purchased, then it is made the duty of
the Department to make a foundation upon "this
property, which the United States already own.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. Is not that
provided for in the $400,000 contract'
Mr. McCORKLE. No, sir; Â§400,000, as in
the case you brought up from Kentucky, is appro-
priated to building a custom-house, and not laying
the foundation.
Mr. MARSHALL. I ask the gentleman if
the contract has been made for putting up the house
without putting under it the foundation?
Mr. McCORKLE. The contract is for putting
up the house, and not putting in the foundations.
Mr. GOODENOW demanded tellers upon the
amendment, but they were not ordered.
The question was then taken upon Mr. Mae-
shill's amendment, and it was disagreed to.
The question recurred upon agreeing to the
amendment of the Senate, and being put, it was
decided in the affirmative.
Mr. HOUSTON moved that the committee rise
and report the bill and amendments to the House;
which motion was agreed to,
The committee accordingly rose,and the Speaker
having resumed the chair, the Chairman [Mr.
Stuart] reported that the Committee of the Whole
