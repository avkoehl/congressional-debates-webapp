United States, and the effect of Us adoption would
he to leave the Treasury Department to continue
us experiment to the 1st of July, and leave the
levenue already acciuec m me deposite banks to
be expended m the ordmaiy course of aisburse-
raent It provided, in prospective, for the deposite
of the revenue aca nng after that period in the
Bank of the United States, and foi the restoration
of the laws to tneir just ajtlronty But it might
be said that we had no nght to expect the sanction
of the House of Repiesentatives to this measure.
But whatevei us fate might be, it was not a matter
whicn ought to have any influence on the Senate
The Senate owed it to itself and to the countiy to
discharge its whole duty—let others discharge
theirs aoeoiding to then own views of duty or not
He was unwilling to return to his constituents
without having made every tfloit in his powei to
legam the lawful custody of the public treasure,
and he thought that there was out this lesolution
left for this purpose, and the decision upon it would
determine whether the public money should be
left at the will and disposition of one man 01 not
To morrow would be one year since any head of
the Treasuiy Department had been appointed by
and with the advice and corsent of the Senate
Gentlemen had said, why this anxiety foi thtse
nominations' He answeied, no other reason but
because the Constitution required them to be made
Grentlemen asked if wewanted to íejsctthem Mi
C said he did not acknowledge a light to make
such an inquny into motives, but if it might be
made, he might, wi h equal propriety, ¡isk, were
they withheld from a fear of then being i ejected ?
Mr CLAY concluded by asking leive to intro-
duce the resolutions, expressing a hope that they
might be acted on immediatel}, passed, and sent
to the other House
Mr  BENTON deemed the piesent moment to
be the most objectionable time that could  have
oeen selected for proposing to re^toie the ¡ ubhe
deposites  to the  United   States   Bai k     Such a
proposition night have been a proper pioceedmg
at the commence i ent of the session    A joint res
olution at that time would have been the propel
node, itcould ! ave been followed by action, and,
if constitutionally passed, would ha\e compelled
the lestoiation ol these deposites    But the course
was diffeient    A separate resolution was biought
in and passed the Senate, and theie it stopped
It was a nngatoiy resolution, leading to no action
it was such a one as a State Legislature or a pub
uc meeting  might adopt, because  they had  no
powei to legislate on the suljeet     But the Senate
had the powerof legislation, ai d,six monthsago,   '
wnen the sepaiate resolution was broushi in, the   I
Senate, if it mterded to act   °gi latively on  the
subject at all, ought to lave pioceeded by joint
lesoiuuon, 01 by bill at that t me    But it thought
otherwise     Ihe sepaiate .esomtion was adopted
aftei adoption ro lnstiu^lion was given to a com
mittee to bitng in a bn1, nothn g was done to give
legislative effect to the decision of the Senate, and
now, at the end of sis: months, the first attempt is
made to move in oui legislative tapacity, anu to
pass a joint resolution—equivalent to a siatute—
to compel the restoration of these deposites    This
is the state of the proceedings, and, Mr  B  must
be peimitted to say, and to give his leasons for
saying, that the'time selected tor this first step, m
oui legislative capacity, in a case so long depend-
ing, is most inappropitate and oojectiorabk    Mi
B   would  not dwe'l  upon    he  palpable  objto
tions to this proceeding, which a _ist stake every
mind     the  advanced   stage of    the  session—the
piopuMtion to adjourn—the q nntity of business
on   hand—tne 1 tile ptobabtluy   that  the Ho ise
and the Piesident would concur wi h   heSeiate,
oi  that two thuds of the two Houses could be
brought to pass the lesolution, if the Piesident
declined to give  t his approbation,—these palpa   I
ble objectioi s must strike eveiy mind, and make
it appear to be a useless coisumpton of time I
fot  the Senate to pass the resolution     Virtually,
It included a proposition to lechaitet 'he batk,
for the most confiden ml ft lends of tl at institution
admitted tha' it was imptouei  to restoie the de
posites unless the bank charterwns to oecontti ued
The pioposuion to íebtne,   hen, vir'u illv. in< !u
ded the piooositio l to iednrt"t   and thitwai a
pioposii or wnich after having been open y made
en tms fuoi, and leave asked to bring in a bill to
that effect had been abandoned under the clear
conviction that the measure could not pass
Passing from these palpable objections, Mi B.
proceeded to state another reason, of a different
kind, and which he held to be imperative of the
course which the Senate should now pursue, he
alluded to the state of the questions at this moment
depending between the Bank of the United States
and the House of Representatives, and the nature
of which exacted from the Senate the observai ce
of a stiict neutrality, and an absolute non inter
ference between those two bodies The House of
Representatives had ordered an inquiry into the
aflans end conduct of the bank The pointb of
lnquuyit di ated misconduct of the gravest import,
and had been ordered I y the largest majority, not
less *htn thiee or foul to one That inquiry was
not yet finished, it was still depending, ihpcom
mittee appointed to conduct it remains organ zed,
and has only reported in pait Thatrepoit isbe-
foie the Senate and the public, and shows that the
dnectois of the Bank of the United States have
res'sted the authonty of the House—have made
an issue of powei between itself and the House—
for tí e trial of which issue a íesolution is now de-
pet ding in the House, and is made the order of the
day for 1 uesday next Heie, then, are two ques
tions depending between the House and the bank,
the fust, an n quiry into the misconduct of the
bank the second, a proposition to compel the bai k
to sub nit ta the authonty of the House Was it
right foi the Senate to interpose between those
bodies while these questions were depending'
Was it light o mteifeie on the part of the bank'
Was it ngot foi the Senate to leap into the arena,
thiovv itself between the contending parties, take
rides with the bark, and virtually decíate to the
\uifcrH an t et pie that there w<~s no cause for in-
quny into the tonduct of the bank, and no giou id
ofcensuiefoi re istn g theauthoii y of theHouse'

and tl e House is wrong, in the question now

nothing to meiit inquiry , or to deseive censure,

cisión of the resolution which affirms that the hank
has issisted the authuiity of the House, and com-
mitted a coi tempt against it This s the full and
fan mterpietation—the cleat and speaking effect—
of the measute now pioposed to the Senate Is it
light to tieat the House thus Hei lesoh.tions,
adopted with the gieites  unanimity, imply the
wou of misconduct to the bank Certainly the
House would n>.t order an nquiy, unless they
lelieved there was ground foi it—grave and serious
ground for it      Ihe specified  joints of inquny

ing a lesolti ion of honoi ard confidence to tile

In the fimt of tl ese mqjnies (said Mi B )
stood the piominentsubject of the public distress,
that disneas whiv.ii had oeen the sub,ect of so
many me°i ii£s,tne ourdeior so many rpemoi'sK,
and the pregnant tc p>c of so many v oful speeches
on this flooi I he fi st subject of inquny was,
into he cause ot this distress,. The committee
were diree'ed to asceitain whether the bank,
through its nioiey.d tin ough its management
and influence, had ontiil uted to produce this dis
tre^s wl-ich the innumerable memorials presented
to Coigiess so bi eily complained oi, and they |
we'-e dnected to seairh foi the evidence of that
fact m the bank use f Will tne Senate, by its
act, vntually affirm thefnvolity,oi theuntruth, of
this inquiry > Will the Senate vir'ually, intelligi-
bly, and practically, acquit the bank, when the
bank will not acquit itself' will not suffer Us inno-
cence to be tested by the recorded voice of its own
books, and the living voice of its own directors'
These directors have refused to testify; they have
refused to be swoin, they have refused to touch
the book, because, being directors, and corpora-
toi s, and therefore parties, they cannot be required
to give evidence against themselves. And this
i efusal, the public is giavely told, is made upon the
advice of eminent counsel What counsel ' The
counsel of the law, oi of fear' Certainly no law-
yer—not even a j unior apprentice to the law—could
give such-advice The light to stand mute does
not e\tend to the pnvilcge of refusing to be sworn.
Ihe right does not attach until after the oath is
taken, and is then limited to the specific question,
the answer to which might inculpate the witness,
and which he may refuse to answer, because he
will say, upon his oath, that the answer wnl elimi-
nate himself But these bai k directors refuse to
be swoin at all They refuse to touch the book;
and in that refusal, commit a flagrant contempt
against the House of Representatives, and do an
act foi which any citizen would be sent to jail by
any justice of the peace in America And is the
Senate to justify the directois for this contempt'
to get between them and the House' to adopt a
resolution beforehand—before the day fixed for th 
decision of the contempt, which shall throw the
weight of the Senate into the scale of the directois
against the House, and virtually declare that thty
aie right in refusing to be sworn' If it does, (sail
Mr B ,) it may find itself confronted by the au-
thority of the bank, as well as by the stern voire
of the law The bank itself—the directors ind'
vidually, and the coiporation as a board—have
heretofoie admi'ted and declared the right of the
people to have the evidence which is now demand-
ed He did not speak of the former examinations,
in which d lectins viere sworn, and bocks exam-
ined Strong as these cases were, he passed them
over, to get at ca^es stiongei sull, and which
should exhibit the piesent directors themselves—
the sime men, individually and corporately,upor
then oaths, and upon their honois, in then most
solemn ai d authentic acts, contradicting and con-
demning then present pietensions, and acknowl-
edging the tight of the peiple to have the evidence
of then books, ind of then oaths, to elucidate any
question, enhei of abuse of powers, corruption of
conduct, oi violation of charter, which may be
charged upon them Mr B said that the present
President of the bank had, heretofore, sworn to
the ueht of Congress to know everything that toe
hank did It was in ihe investigaron of 1832, ai tl
in ¡elation to a loan, wl ich, at the uttermost, coutd
only amount to m vlpractice, abuse, or corrupt on,
and could not woik a 1 lfe tuie of the chapter it
was the case of 'he fiist loan to "Voin & Webb
This loan of <J]5,010 had not been en'ered upon
the books of Hit bai k Nine months aiter it was
made, it was for the fust time put uj on theboolts.
The reason of this was stated by Mr Biddle, in
his examtnat on before the committee It will ha
seen at page SO of the repoit of that commit'ee
A committee ot the House of Representatives were
coming to investigate the affairs of the bank
X ins loan was not upon the bocks but at the ap-
pro ich of the committee, Mr Biddle ordeicd i* to
be pit theie, and declaies Ins re ison to be th s
" I i HOLtrilT IT RIGHT THAT EVLRY

' dislnrdii KNOWN mid AVOWED I theiefore
'gane the i'oleí i> the chai i man ot the committee, Mi
' Iliomas P Copt, alio entend than on the bools "
Mr B said that he refened ti this testimony of
Mr Biddle, not for the ttansaction to which it
lelated, but foi the sentiment \vh t-h it declared, a
sentiment sworn to, and acted upon, in 18á2, and
denied and renudiated by the same men m 1834'
He had no comment to make upon this con'iadic-
tion, the glanng ratuie of which woald strike
eveiy mind
Mi B proceeded to the neyt pifce of evidence,
emanating fiom the bank itself,to piove theack.io>v-
ledgment of their obi ga ion to submit the opera-
tions of the bank to tf e judgment rf th" people
E-eiybody (said Mr B ) has heard of t! c resolu-
tions of the bank, adopted at the Board of Direc
tors, and confirmed and exierdtJ by  successive
