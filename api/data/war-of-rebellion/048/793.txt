Numbers 75. Report of Lieutenant John K. Bucklyn, Battery E, First Rhode Island Light Artillery.
HDQRS. BATTERY E, FIRST RHODE ISLAND ARTILLERY,Camp near Brandy Station, December 4, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor respectfully to submit the following report of the operations of my battery in the recent movements across the Rapidan:

Thursday, November 26, I broke camp at daylight and reported to General Birney, commanding First Division. I marched with the First Division to Jacobs' Mills, on the Rapidan, but this ford being deemed impracticable for artillery, Captain Randolph ordered me to move down the river to Germanna Ford and move upon the other side and rejoin the division. This gave me a long, tedious march, and I did not come up with the division until reveille. The other batteries of the corps did not come up until several hours after.

Friday morning I reported to General Prince, commanding Second Division, and marched near the head of his column to a place called Locust Grove. Here I took position and fired slowly at the enemy massed in front of me. About 4 o'clock the enemy charged our lines with such impetuosity that he quickly drove our infantry from the woods. With the peculiar rebel yell they came on until the reached the edge of the woods, about 30 yards in my front, when I gave them canister shot, spherical case, and shell, as fast as I could load and fire. Those that escaped fell back in confusion, and our troops immediately occupied the field. Early yesterday morning I reported to General Birney, and marched past Robertson's Tavern to a position near Mine Run. Here I remained, watching the enemy and firing occasionally, until Tuesday. I reported to Captain Robinson early Tuesday morning and marched with the Artillery Reserve
