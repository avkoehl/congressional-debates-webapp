be netessaiy to make men ion of some facts with

ment from tl e Tiea«uiy Depa-tment it appearss
that the aggrega e amount of foi e gn coal imported
into the United S at s dumg ihe year 1«33, was
2 25G,14d 1 u=iie s, en wmc 1 the daties amounted
to s}¡3a,J(¡y 58 1 iat there was im| orted mío the
ci vol JSewYoik alone, duinig the same year,
1,237 532 bushel?, on which, ihe du íes amounted
to the sum or §74,2al 92, being iiure thin one-
ha'i the entire ri¡_ nation of foie.gn coal for that
year, an 1 this coal wes consumed in tnat city and.
in 1 s immediate /ie m y, rnd sold ai an average
once of t\> enly five cu ts per bushe' By aieport
of tne cty 1 ísjector pride m omsuance of the

wi 1 out 11 cludirg tl e cos' of domestic fuel in the

f mount to neaily tv 0 r ii ions of dollars, ai d this
enormous cTP=ump 101 of fu l is increasing with.
the ai gmenta nr of the population and extension
of manu'actu-ing e=tab ishments Among the
articles en ir"er"ed in tie repoit of th  city in-
spector are 53 8^24 topso'apthracite coal, varying
in price from 5.8 (>4, to $6 29 per ton From the
best information l am ab'e to obtain, theenthracite
coal can be brought to the city of ISew York and
sold by retail, and y el J a fair profit at a price
varying from five dollars to six dollars and fifty
cents per ton
When it is consilered that the price of fuel of
a1! kirds is enhanced to the extent of this tax, or
r°ai'y so, a"d that the cost of fuel enters into

and of eveiy marufactuied article, fiom ahorse

prooortion to ther co"sumption of fore'gn and
