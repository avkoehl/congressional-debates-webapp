them. It is still going on. I have directed him if possible to get possession of the gap to-night before it is too dark. The enemy will probably hold it pretty firmly. I will await any movement of Garrard's brigade till I hear again from Graham. I think, however, I will move up with them very early in the morning and try to get possession of Thorn Hill-the gap leading to Bean's Station. This, however, depends upon the movements of the enemy to-night. an officer of the Forty-fifth Ohio has just passed who is just from Knoxville. The road is all clear. The enemy are retreating up the valley followed by the cavalry of Generals Shackelford and Sherman. They will hold the gaps of Clinch Mountain with considerable tenacity, but I will try to force them as speedily as I can, to attack their flank while the cavalry in rear pushes them up. I will report again to-night.

Respectfully,
