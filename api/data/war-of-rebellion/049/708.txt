RICHMOND, September 10, 1863.

General R. E. LEE,

Orange Court-House, Va.:

Your dispatch and letter received. It will involve delay to send the brigade of General Wise. Cannot a brigade of Pickett's division be advantageously substituted. Jenkins will go.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

ORANGE COURT-HOUSE, September 10, 1863.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Anderson's brigade, Hood's division, and Bryan's brigade, McLaws' division, are selected by General Lonstreet to go to Charleston. If preferred, Wise and Jenkins could go in their place and Pickett's division remain in vicinity of Richmond. Three battalions of artillery are ordered to Richmond. Their horses cannot accompany the guns farther, and their guns should not be forwarded unless horses can be obtained at the scene of operations.

R. E. LEE.

[Indorsement.]

This seems to me better, unless there be reason to fear straggling from the brigades named, or unless the orders given will obstruct execution.

If you prefer this, give orders at once.

J. D. [DAVIS.]
