Lieutenant Colonel A. J. SWAIN,

Chillicothe:

What reports to you get from the detachment in the brush? Do you have any trouble with the volunteers? I have authority to raise four twelve-months' regiments for U. S. service. What can be done in the counties immediately about you?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

CHILLICOTHE, July 28, 1864.

General FISK:

Some complaints from the men sent out; nothing serious. The volunteer militia deserve great praise for their commendable conduct while at this post. I think we can raise some men for twelve-months' service. Am not able at present to state the probable number Colonel Meller, of the Sixty-sixth Regiment, with 230 men, armed and mounted, are waiting orders from you. Please instruct me where to send them.

A. J. SWAIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 28, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. SWAIN,

Chillicothe:

I am glad to hear so good a report from the militia. Keep a firm hand upon the boys. Let Major McLanahan come to Saint Joseph and see me. I will do the best I can for him.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
