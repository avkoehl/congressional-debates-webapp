HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 15, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

I have advices of that and do not credit it, nor am I certain that Forrest has crossed the river. Morgan was married last night at Murfreesborough. No further news from the cavalry reported to have crossed at Hartsville.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 15, 1862

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

We have pretty conclusive evidence that East Tennessee is clear of enemy and their troops concentrated round Murfreesborough. Send expedition,with all possible dispatch, to destroy railroad bridge over Little Tennessee at Loudon. They watching me, will not suspect you.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, December 16, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The following message has just been received from operator at Cave City:

Major Gratz, of the Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, just in from Glasgow; forces all ordered off. He reports the rebels in force at, or close to, Glasgow-about 1 mile from there. Later information by Federal spies and scouts confirm report. Their intention is to capture supplies and passenger train at this point, and tear railroad. There are no Federal troops at Glasgow or this point, having all left this morning.

This news is reliable beyond a doubt.

J. T. BOYLE

Brigadier-General.
