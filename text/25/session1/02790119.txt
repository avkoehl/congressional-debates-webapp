25th Cong....1st Sess.                                   Making public officei s depont tries—Mr. Wright,                                                    Senate-.
If we do not provide a sound standard of cuirenc},
our masters, the people, cannot enjoj a sound cur-
rency, for to us, they have entrusted the duty of
selecting and establishing that standanl We act
for them, and not for ourselves, and the standard of
currency we adopt for the public Treasury, is
adopted for them, and not for i s
Another argument, very nearlv allied in charac-
ter to the last, is urged against th" passage of this
bill It is said its effect will be to raise the salaries
and compensations of the public officers Some
have stated the mciease to be equal to ten, some to
twelve and a half and he believed he had seen
some statements raising it as high as twenty per
cent upon the piesent compensations What
foundation had this argument' The same as the
former It went upon the assumption that the
currency of the countrv vas now, and was always
to remain, base and depieciated That a dollar
of currency was not, and was not to be equal in
value to a statute, standard dollar Look at the
position in its true light, and its fallacy will be in-
stantly manifest The compensations of all public
ofheers aie fixed by law Take our own compen-
sation for example We aie to íeceive a given
number of dollars per day, for each day of our
service This is the conn act between us and the
people How then are v e to be paid' Are «i to
have eight dollars for each day we ooo ipy these
seats, or are we to have eight promises of some
bank to pay, which aie worth but four dollars'!
Does any man doubt which w as the intention of the
law' Will anv man contend that we are overpaid
if we receive eight dollars in gold 01 silvei, as tne
value thereof is regulated by Congress'! Will not
all admit that vi e are rot paid according to the law
unless we receive that value1 But, say gentle
men, gold anu sih er beais a premium m the mar-
ket, and theierore any given amount paid m the
standard coins of the country, is ovei paid to the
extent of the premium upon the coins Here rests
the error The premises are false, and the conelu-
son, therefore, falls to the ground Gold and silver
does not, and can not propel ly speaking, bear a pre-
mium An American silver dollar can no more
be worth one hundred and ten, or one hundied and
twenty-five cents, in this countrj, than a standard
pound can weigh a po md and a quaiter The one
thing is as impossible as the other Both are them-
selves standard , the one of "value,and the other of
quantity, and the iormercan no note vaiy than
the latter Tne dollar is worth exacdy c ne hun-
dred cents Ii is the measure of thai vain , and
cannot be worth either more or less than that sum
It is itself the par of monet, Whatevei is above
it bears a prem um, and whatever is below it is at
a discount 1 his error m computirg the value of
mone}, and the value of oui papei currency, is so
universal, that it is not smgulai tnts argument
should appear plausible to most mnds, without a
somewhat close examina ion All the statements
we see published, adopt the value of the p«per as
the par of monej, and b-cause the geld and silvei
are more vaiuab'e, and command a higher price in
the maiket than papei, they aie said t-> bear a pre-
mium Tne error arise from adopting -meiro-
neous standaid for the par value The paper is
not par when gold and silvei aie worth more than
it They are the par, and the paper is depreciated
A moment', reflection will show ev^ry man that
this is the true po i ion Win, tien, it will be
asked, are not the statements of the marl et value
of ourcuirency, daily published to the coantiy,
made u¡ en the true, in 1 not upon a falsp has si
The boards of brokers ?nd r-^nkei-s and deah rs in
money woul 1 probably b° able to account for the
mannT m which these st?t< ments lie made It is
much more accept i le to them anddeubtless much
more favoiable to the cncuUt on and cied t of the
deprecated bank papei, to use it as the pai the
standard of value, and to present gi Id ai c silver it
a pren mm as bemg aoiualh w <- rth a i nt 11 e\ ond
its statute value, its value ..s a tender m tV pay-
ment of cebts
A single fact wInch transp red m this c ty 11 t a
day or two since will show t!„ practice] elect of
this mole of computing the value of moncv A
member of the Senate, within the last few t'avs, re-
lated to me the following incident    The Senatoi
stepped into a shop upon the Avenue to purchase
some small article The price was given to him
by the shopkeepei at eighty-s"ven and a half
cents He presented a dollar in silver to make
payment, when he was informed that the price was
given at eghty-savtn and a half cents under the
expectation that payment would be made in paper,
m "shm plasters " as they are called, and that it
was but seventy-fiv e cents if paid m specie, and he
received a ouarter of i doll.r in change and the
article he desired Was this difference of price a
piemium upon the silver1 No, sir It was an ad-
dition to cover the depreciation of paper The
seventy-fiie cents was tie value of the article in
money The eignty-sevcn and a half cents was
the value in depreciated paper This little incident
shows us the tax which wojd be imp >sed upon the
public «editors, inci tdmg the Ouiceis of the Go-
vernment, if we neie l> pay them in i depieciated
currency It shows us that we should, at once,
sink their c< mpensalions about one-sixth, as that
would be the additional charge against them tor
every necessaiy of life, because they must make
pajment ma currency so much deprecated It
shows us also the immense tax which the while
community must pay so long as they aie compelled
to use abase currency, and shall we men be urged
to adopt a standard of currency for the public Trea-
sury below the value of gold and silver1
A third argument against the passage of this bill,
urged with great zeal and earnestness b) those
w ho pi t it forth, is, that it w ill extend most fear-
fully the Executive pationage of this Government,
that it will tend to strengthen the Executive arm
to the danger of public hbeily itself He would
examine concisely this stalling objection The
bill create  no new oificns It proposes to entiust
the safe-keeping of the public funds \ ltnthe olfi
cers who now collect them these officers are all
appointed by the President and Senate, by the
President alone, oi by the heads of some one of the
Executive Departments They are all public offi-
cers of the Government, responsible to it, and to
the people, for then official acts Thev, are all
now removable at the pleasuie of the President
The bill does not propose to change the mode of
their appointment oi to increase their liability to
dismission from office by the Executive In what
way, than, does it increase the Executive power
over them, or strengthen that aim of the &o\em-
inent for good or fcr ev ilJ He wculdtike a ca ,
tne more clear!) to illustrate his views th collec-
tor of the port of New York, a place of high trust
and responsibility already, and to be made much
more so if this bill becomes a law, is appointed by
the President, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, he is removable at the pleasure of
the President without cause, either proved oi as-
signed, this is the relation of that officer to the
Executive branch of the Government, under tie
existing laws Does the bill before us piopos.e to
change that relation1 Not in anywaj whatever
It merely pre poses to nal e that oflicer keep and
disburse the monev he col'ects, instead of handing
it ovet to a baik foi safe keeping and it will re-
quire *hat he should strengthen his official bond
and sureties to meet the increased official responsi
bility But v-ould any gentleman e^p am to him
how in" power or mfluerce of the Lxecutive over
the oíucer was ti be mcrpasedbv these proceedings
That power and influence could on y be evened m

I public moneys were tiansferred for saje keeping
from the late Bank of the United States to IjiejState
banks, forgotten the vivid pictuies, daily;-drawn
upon this floor, of the immense stnde which had
been taken by the Executive powci m the adop-
tion of that system of deposites1 Were v e not con-
stantly told of the army of bank agents, bank
officers, and bank directors, p-rsons unknown to
the Constitution and the law and not ¡ esponsibie
to Congress oi the people, w hich that system bad
biought wihin Executive influence, and engaged
in Ihc seivice of the Executive1 Who did not then
feel that tlvic was some foice in tnese remarks'?
And who that was a fnend to the then admimsua-
uon, end not s*ri'ggie incessantly to procure the
passage of some law which should bring that system,
of tleposites w ithm the power and control of Con-
gress1 And aie we now to be urged to return to
Inaisjsten , *o ic ennst that numerous body of bank
m. " uers, md leco meet them w.th the Executive
lianch oí the Government, to prevent an extension
of Pxeeuuve patronage and power, by the simple
euip oyment of officers of our own appointment,
direi ily responsible to the people, and to the repre-
sent it ve. of the pee pie here1 The position was
absurd It was to urge us upon the very evil we
were cautioned to avoid, to embrace a danger
exi ting in its worst form, to discharge ourselves
from one of a merely imaginan chaiacter
No, sir ü gent'emen would take a calm and
dispassionate view e Í this subject, they would see
that tl e bill would incitase immensely, fearh I' ,
the Executive rtspon' bihties, not th Executive
power If the system pioposed be adopted, the
people will nold thePresidm tepnsible for his
selection of the ofhceis o be entrusted w th the
safe i eping ef the r treasure, and ac) will hold
the head of the Treasury Depaitment re pon-
s ble for an incessant and sleepless vigilance
over these depositories This, will be the influence
the bill will exert upon the Executive branch of the
Government. It will throw upon the Executive
officers a great increase of care and responsibility—
noi an mciease of power oi influence
Indeed, so stiongly had this increase of responsi-
bility, even upon the mmoi Executive oflicers,
impressed itself upon the mind of one of the ¿en-
tlemcn who had addressed the Senate, (Mr Rives,)
as to induce him to entei am the apprehension that
men of proper character, standing-, -Mid íesponsibi-
hly could nut be fo ind willing to accept the irus s
For himself, he a^ almost leaelv to say thai ho
vvjshcd he could entertain moie apprehension upo i
this point than the argument of the Senatoi had in
spued him with He had no fear of living to see
that period when the lucrative and honorable and
deniable offices of this Government would go beg-
ging for incumbents, when candidates, of the mtist
unquestioned qualifications in every sense, would
net voluntarily present themselves, and conflict
w ith tach other for the places At points where
the emoluments of office did not present adequate
temptatnn, the collections must be small, and the
trust fij-ht, so that he was at perfect ease upon this
point and had on'v alluded to it to enforce his own
po t on that the bill was calculated to increase 
Executive resionsihilitj, net to extend Executve
pow ei
