HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,Battle-field, Jones' Plantation, May 11, 1864-7.15 p. m.

GENERAL: In covering the ground vacated by Webb and Owen, I must move Coulter from the line of entrenchments he has been occupying and upon which he is at work. I desire to report that the enemy are preparing to establish a battery which will enfilade my line from the right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 11, 1864-7.30 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

I do not want you to move Colonel Coulter out to the front. Take the Pennsylvania Reserves and lengthen them out so as to hold the whole line, even if they are in but one rank. I want this line thin, because of the enfilading battery you speak of. Keep Coulter in the trenches where he is, and tell him to keep cutting timber in his front and make it strong. If your men are attacked on the outer line, let them hold on as stubbornly as possible. General Gibbon will communicate with you when he wishes to withdraw, and you must replace his line as quickly as possible.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General CUTLER:

I send you good news from Sheridan's advance in the enemy's rear. Have your command in readiness at daybreak, and your skirmish line very strong. There is to be a heavy attack made by us at daybreak on the enemy's right, and he will undoubtedly feel our front. Keep clearing away the woods in your front.
