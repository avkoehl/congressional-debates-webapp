Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

The force that has been threatening the road south of the Etowah was part of Clanton's. We captured 2 of their scouts. I had cavalry as far as Dallas yesterday. Clanton's men have gone back toward Alabama.

General STEEDMAN,Chattanooga:

You may detain the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry at Dalton till I make further inquiry. Look out for Clanton from the south. I think you may gobble him up, as he doubtless calculates to meet Wheeler at Dalton or Graysville. Get down all the cavalry you can from above.

Major-General, Commanding.

General STEEDMAN,Chattanooga:

I have instructed General Thomas to assemble as much cavalry as he can about Dalton, from which it seems to me the road can be better watched than from any other point. Should Wheeler get the road about Athens could we communicate with Knoxville by the river and Kingston?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I sent scouting party this morning from Dalton to Alpine, by way of Villanow, and another to La Fayette, through Ship's Gap. We can communicate with Kingston or Loudon by river. The enemy are destroying the track of the Knoxville. The Loudon bridge is safe.
