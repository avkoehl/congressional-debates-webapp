Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, stated, during the
call of the roll, that Mr. Watkins was detained
at his room by indisposition.

moved to lay the motion to reconsider upon the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. J. GLANCY JONES. The first amend-
ment of the Senate, on winch theie was a dis-
agreement, was as follows:
And a niffir-ieni t.um. in addition tbcieto, to pnv the
mtlea'r ^ of the newly-oleetcd membeis of the Senate m at-
toiidaiue at Uie callcd executive session, coimneucins on
tlie 4th day of Maieli, 18o7 ; bat nothing herein contained
blia'I be bo eonbtiued as to allow constructive nnlcagc.
From that amendment the Senate recedes.
The fourth amendment—and the second in or-
der of the disagreeing votes—was as follows:
F01 the additional compensation allowed bytheiesolu-
tion of the Benate ot the 11th of May, to a messenger
in the office of the Sccretaiv of the Senate for the fiscal
yeai ending the 30th of June, 1858, $330.
That being a provision of the Senate, for one
of its own officers, the House receded from it.
The fifth amendment was as follows:
For stationery for fiscal year ending CO til June, 1858,
$3,000
The House recedes from that amendment, with
an amendment to ydd the words:
For Sen.-oo : and 101 f-tanonety for fi-cal jcar ending
30th lupe. lt~>d. ^">.0 0 lor the IJoa^e of Reptw.-ntative-.
The. £5,000 in the Senate amendment was to
provide for a deficiency for stationery for the use
of S-mafois.
The House amended by adding §5,000 for the
use of the House. The House is familiar with
the faet that there is a standing law providing
forty-five dollars for stationery for each member
for long sessions, and twenty-five dollars for each
sh.oit si's.Mon. i undeistand that tlie fund set

1 eial purposes of the building at the coiner of F

Tlie Senate agieed to tiie amendment of the
House.
! The twenty-seventh amendment of the Senate
. was ns follows:
1 Foi the leaMHiahie ovivn'os of the late and pio«ent dis-
| tuet .una ie\\' ? to: the nottheia rh-tuct of Caiifo.m.i, tor a?-

\eai and the next Hueeeedm^fi-eal yeai, which \mI1 term-
maf on the oOth day ot Jane, ld5D."
The Senate rcccdcd from this amendment.
This brings me to the last amendment, upon"
which the committee could notagree; The House
appended to the bill, in the form of a second sec-
tion, the following clause:
Sec. 2. Ami be it further eaac'cd, That no part of the
amount appropriated by any act of Congie>s foi the Pin vice
of any one fiscal year, shall be n -cdfor or applied to the ser-
vice of any other year, nor be ttan>'eried to or u-cd for any
branch of expenditure t-iian that for which it maybe specifi-
cally appropriated : Provided, That nothing hciem c ontriined
shall apply to appropuauons foi the piesent or next fiscal
year.
The Senate amended by striking out tlie words
inserted by the House, and inserting, in lieu
thereof, the following:
Hereafter, the estimates for the various Executive l)e-
pattme-it-5 shin! do^spiate, not only tuc amount l.-quired to
be appropi jatcd for tint next fi-eal vcai, but a^o tne amount
of the outstanding appioprianon, it then; he any, winch will
piobatilv be icquned to be used foi c.veh pait.culai item of
expenditure
The committee of conference upon the part of
the House could not agree with the committee
on the part of the Senate m this amendment after
throe several meetings.
As a member of that committee upon the part
of the House, I concurred, in my own private
judgment, with that of the Senate upon this
amendment; but as a member of tins House, feel-
ing it to be my duty, acting as I did in my rep-
resentative character, m consequence of the very
decisive vote of the EL u.c.o I did not fuel at lib-
erty to recede. The h'enate committee would not
teeeue. The committee, theiviore, agreed to re-
port to the House the fact that they had failed to
agree upon this amendment.
Mr. JACKSON. If the report of the commit-
tee of conference, of winch I am a member, shall
be adopted by the House, there will be but one
matter of disagreement between the two Houses,
which is in lefmeuce to tins last amendment of
the Senate. The Senate struck out a provision
in the bill, which was inserted on motion of the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. SnumiAsr,] and in-
seited a substitute therefor. I desire to submit a
motion that the House recede from its disagree-
ment to the Senate amendment; and I do so for
the pi'i pose of expediting the business of the ses-
sion. We an; all anxious to adjourn on next
Monday. This legisi ttive, executive, and judi-
cial appropriation bill must be passed. If this
single amendment hangs fne much longer be-
tween the two Houses, we maybe compelled to
prolong the session. 1 desire, therefore, to test
the sense of the House upon this amendment,
and shall move that the House recede from its
disagreement to the Senate amendment.
Mr J. GLANCY JONES. Can that motion
be m nle now ?
Tin ■ SI'EAivER. The proposition of the gen-
tlenuin fiom Geoigia cannot be entertained until
the nputt of th' committee of conference has
I mm n di-po.^i d of.
Mr. JACKSON. If the report of thccommit-
tec of eonleieaee be agreed to, will the motion
then be in order 5
The Sl^/UvKR. It will.
Mr. JACK JON. J gi\e notice, then, that if
the repoi tof the committee of con telenet be agreed
to, I shall submit the motion to recede from the
disagreement to that Senate amendment.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I simply desire to
give notice that if the report of the committee or
conference be agie^d to, I shall move that the
House insist on its disagreement.
Mr. RUFFIN. I desuc to ask a question of
my friend from Pennsylvania. There seems to
be an appropriation inserted by the committee of
conference of £3,000 for stationery for members.
II sterns the Senate has put m an appropriation of
£,5,0U0 for stationery, and that the committee of
conference have put m a like appropriation of
$3,000 for the House. I want to know how this
amount b( comcsneccssary? I should like to have
the gentleman from Pennsylvania explain.
Mr. J. GLANCY JONKS. I will answer the
question with great pleasure. Before the meeting
of the committee of conference I received an esti-
mate from the Cleik of the House informing me
that that amount would be necessary for the pres-
ent session to poy for the stationery of the mem-
bers. A deficiency to this amount had arisen, and
I thought it better to put it in the appropriation
bill m preference to passing a joint resolution,
which 1 had in my desk ready te  offer. The sum
appropriated for this purpose at the last session
