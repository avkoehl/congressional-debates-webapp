Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps, Rossville:

GENERAL: Dr. Phelps has delivered to me your messages, and I have arranged for Johnny, Chap, and George Watson to leave in the morning early on their horses for Bridgeport, Beard, the postmaster, to bed their guide. I shall send half a dozen of Kaldenbaugh's men with them, to return same day. From thence they will go to Stevenson by rail and await a few days for news or orders. Your headquarters train will cross the river at daylight. After seeing the boys fight to-morrow. All that I hope is that we may punish them badly and maintain our position, and I believe we will do both. Van Cleve is here, but of this, of course, you are aware.

Respectfully and truly,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

I am instructed to say by the general commanding that your troops will move back to Chattanooga at 12 midnight to-night. An officer at Chattanooga will assign the troops to their positions. By moving promptly at the appointed time there will be no confusion or interruption from other troops; the brigade with Crittenden will march with him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. FLYNT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SEPTEMBER 21, 1863.

Major-General GRANGER:

GENERAL: Wheeler has crossed the ridge and occupies the valley on the right with his whole cavalry command. The information is reliable. What does it mean? They will attack us, in my judgment, on our left in the morning with fury. The cavalry will make a feint on the right.

STEEDMAN,

Brigadier-General.
