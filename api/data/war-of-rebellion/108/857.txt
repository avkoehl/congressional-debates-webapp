HEADQUARTERS ARMIES CONFEDERATE STATES,Richmond, April 12, 1864.

Major General G. E. PICKETT,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: Inclosed I send you copies of instructions to Brigadier-General Hoke and Brigadier-General Ransom, both sent direct to save time, which is an essential element in the operations contemplated. Please send the regiment of Clingman's brigade designated, to report to Brigadier-General Ransom at Weldon immediately, so that it may march with him. The conduct of this expedition is intrusted tio Brigadier-General Hoke, so as not to withdraw you from a supervision of your whole department at this critical time. Please do all you can consistent with proper secrecy to carry out promptly the movements indicated. When this expedition is moving, it may be well to make such demonstrations both from Petersburg and Kinston as will distract the enemy's attention from the main movement, whilst it will also withdraw his attention from our weakened points.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
