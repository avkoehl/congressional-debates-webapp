HEADQUARTERS FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT,Charleston, S. C., June 14, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that yesterday afternoon, the enemy having appeared to be at work on Little Folly Island, Lieutenant-Colonel Yates opened fire upon them, shelling them for about three-quarters of an hour, putting a strop to their operations, which appeared to be erecting a shelter or batteries near the inlet. A close watch has been directed to be kept up, and their work to be stopped whenever attempted.

It is intended to throw an epaulement across the island, to cover the camps and depots from such attempts as the enemy can make.

The main magazine for the detached batteries is completed, and the artillery principally supplies with ammunition.
