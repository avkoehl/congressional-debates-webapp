HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,February 5, 1865-4.20 p.m. (Received 5.30 p.m.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have been at Dinwiddie Court-House. There are but few wagons passing on the Boydton plank road. All (eighteen) that I could hear of I captured. A division of infantry that had been camped four miles above Dinwiddie Court-House, on the plank road, broke camp this morning and went to Petersburg. I am now moving back to Malone's Crossing of the Rowanty, where I will bivouac and report to General Meade. This point is on the military road, two miles and a half from the Vaughan road. The roads are so bad that my command can scarcely get along at all.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brevet Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Cavalry Division.

General Humphreys' right is attacked by A. P. Hill's corps, and to-morrow Hill is to [be] driven in. You will receive orders from General Humphreys after the junction of the Second Corps.
