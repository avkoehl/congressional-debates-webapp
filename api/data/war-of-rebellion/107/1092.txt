HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS,September 23, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

I have three brigades and one regiment disposed as follows: A brigade and battery at Bristoe, a brigade and battery at Rappahannock Station, and the balance with batteries here. I am constructing defensive works here and at the Rappahannock and will do so at Bristoe. I have two regiments at Mannassas as desired; besides this I have located posts at one-fourth of a mile along the railroad, placing reserves so as to relieve. It will not do to abandon these small posts on account of the guerrillas. I don't see how I can change my dispositions except to draw in from Manassas. Surely I must guard Kettle Run bridge.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
