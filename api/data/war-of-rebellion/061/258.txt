On the 9th instant General Emory's division was posted on the right and front of the Pleasant Hill position, one brigade of General Smith's troops relieving one of General Emory's brigades on or near the Mansfield road, about 10 a.m. Nothing important was heard from the enemy until 5 p.m., when a furious attack was made on General Emory's left. This gave way after a hard fight, and the rebels at one time seemed to have possession of the whole plain; but their advance was severely checked by a flank fire from one of General Smith's regiments posted in a wood on the left, and they in turn were driven from the plain and for 1 1/2 miles along the Mansfield road. The remainder of General Emory's line fought handsomely during the whole day, and the enemy was driven back along the whole line with the loss of two guns. During the night the army retreated toward this place, and arrived here on the 11th instant.

I transmitted yesterday a list of the casualties.* The behavior of officers and men was excellent. I beg leave particularly to call the attention of the commanding general to the conduct of Generals Emory and Dwight, which was admirable in all respects. I regret to report the loss of Colonel L. Benedict, One hundred and sixty-second New York Volunteers, killed while leading his brigade, and of Captain Chapman, of my staff, who had both feet taken off by a round shot. Brigadier-General Ransom was severely wounded while commanding his troops in the first action. I shall take a future occasion to make a more detailed report and mention of the names of officers and men who distinguished themselves.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
