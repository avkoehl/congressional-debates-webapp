Revenue Bill—Mr, Linn.
H. ot Reps.
3aw did not itfei to the thing to be acted on, but referred to
some mng e'se He cared not, however, what were the mo
Uves of tii< be who passed u, if it liad answered the purpose
foi «vuichitvis mteided, he was glad it had done go But to
proceed on the 2d of Marca, 1833 Confiese passed what had
been familiar y designated a  the ' force bill " It was placed
in the edition of the Uws a little alter ti e compromise act, one
act intervening That bill was on iUs passage, and that it would
pa*s there was no doubt, and what it might produce no man
could very pi ecisely say He to whom its execution v\asto
be committed was nut a man to halt in m d caieer, he was no
half way man, ho went for no middle measures There might
have been many who, though they were friendly to the policy
of ptotemon, might still feel some misgivings when they saw
the awoid of the law placed in the hand of such a man at tlie
head of the military force of the United States, they might
very natxnally have felt a dread of lis effect, both on public
account and on account of i idividuais implicated so as to be
obnoxious to its vengeance And this feeling might especially
have operated on those who weie opposed to the thenAdrm
nistration and who distrusted President Jackson They would
feel some fear at seeing so gi eat a mass of power and popula-
rity (if indeed, these t.vo words are not here the same) united m
one man, and still further extended and stiengthened by the
support of all who appioved the proclamation end the force
bill—of all who desired the tiiumph of the laws
Thus, from various feelings and considerations, men might
have concurred m the passage of the compromising law of the
2d Maich, 1833 They wished to afford an escape fiom a cribis
If they chose, in so doing, to go fuither and to give toSouth
Carolina the pom* ol honor, Mr ¡3 had no objection now to
make to it, he would not reclaim the concession But when
gerulerrun. came to speak of the bill as to its effect, perma
nently, upon the national revenue and national welfare it was
quite another thing Uonsidei what us effect has been and now
is. The law of July, 1832, had fWed the revenue ata sum
equal to the wants of the Government The act of 1833 did
not adapt itself to this, it did not subject to duty any article
which had been free from dury under the law of 1832, but left
them still free and unproductive It laid no duty on tea oi cof
fee, and did not raise the duty oa silks oi wine It look from
the higher duties reserved, 10 per cent upon the excess he
yond 20 per cent in the first two years, 10 per uent m the
next two years and so on until it had taken off 40 pei cent of
the excess In two years moieallremaming-duty was tocóme
off which exceeded 20 per cent What was the operation and
result of thi^airangement? We can ascettam sufficiently for
the present purpose The late Secre ary of the Treaomy told
Congress a  the las session that the reduction in each of the two
last periods would be two anda half millions of dollars, that is,
five millions for the two periods These two reductions aie
six tenths of the whole Now, if six tenths weie equal to five
m llions of dollars, the remaining four tenths muBtgive $3,333-
000 What followed? The revenue 1 i<=t by thi& act, dm in.* the
firat reduction period, upwards of $800 000, in the second, the
same amount, and soon, till at the end the íeducuon amounts
to nme millions a year He begged gentlemen to recta to
the view already given of the act of 1832 If that act fixed
a true basis foi a system of revenue to meet the wants of the
Government and the necessities of the country, it followed
that the amount to be raised could not be reduced without in
^uryto the public service And what had Congress done?
Taken off nine millions of dolíais, and added nothing to sup
ply its place And now, heie, for the first time, at the end of
nine years, Congiess was taking steps to correct that obvi
ous erroi, which had been operating with cumulative force
foryeais past It could not be effectual y cometed until it
was ascertained how much the public set vice would lequne
And ficts had recently come out w sich showed conclusively that
the actual wants of the Government had not bet n exaggerated
in 1832, lot |ut*t in ptopomoo as thereducnon tinder the com
promise had taken effect, m the same piOpoition had the na

do not say which tins is what they contendel What was
done beyond ihis was a result not forceen, I presume, nut in
tendei!, it happened aside fiom the intent of the act, which wa«,
not to reluce revenue, but to avoid a national difficulty, and it
happened because the act was made for aparticulat puipose,
not being a revenue purpose
The country being in th s condition, us finances in utter dis
order, an fiurr venue insufficient to meet the wants of the pub
he service, what did the present bilUskl To restore the du
ties on the obnoxious articles Mr S wo J I rot now inquire
whetbei Congress had thepowei todo so or not, but wwuld
speak in good faith of the compromise act lie wanted to
know how that act, taking it according to anv constiu tion,
was violated by this biti? Bid any body ask foi high dune on
the <ni<-ii*s so obnoxious to the Sou hi There w«s rot a *ord
of this in the bill As far as it went, i' left untouched the act of
1833, it repealed only the law of 1S32 He dtñed gentlemen
who opposed the bill to point out a single word in it which was
against the act oí 1833
[Mr Wigs here rose and said he was ready to mset the chai
lenge. He asked the gentleman from Pennsylvania to satisfy
him as to the provision w the fourth section of this bill m re
ference to "bleached and unbleached linens," and next to ex
plain to him why wire was made to bt-ai a Out} of 25 pei cent
while there was a laige duty on the imponed material?]
Mr  S saul, if tivie were any items in tho bill which had es-
caped his notice, he should prefer that they snould he jointed
out by the gentleman from Vugima [Mi Wirl] uithm the houi
allowed him lor his own speech, aid not in that allotted to
Mr   S     He could not now go into ihe details oí paruculai
aiticles on the bill but he said of it, geneially that its repeal
ing efficacy was spent upon the law of 1832, and was not meant
to affect that of 1833.    The teecietary of theTreasuiy took the
same view of it   so had the late Secretary an 1 the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means [Mi   Fillmore! had done
the same     If any particular item had escaped their scrutiny,
let it be corrected     But he repeated that the bill did not repeal
the act of 1833, it restored or raised dunes taken away or low
ered by the law of 1832     Its-main stress was to do that—
neither more nor less, to make good the revenue taken away
by the joint operation of the two acts    Did the compromise act
declare, or mean to declare, that Congress misht in no casern
crease the duties levied in 1832?   It did say that such duties as
that law bad laid for protection should he reduced to 20 per
cent    Well   this provision was not touched by the presentbill
As a bill relating to revenue, he had shown that thecompiomise
act was an act of hasty legislation    But what has that act todo
with the question now belore the committee?    That question
was whether Congress was at liberty to lay dutie^uron arti
e'es not competin* with our ownmanuiactuies—not piotected
by the act ol 1832?   With- the facts staling them in the face
that the national revenue was insufficient, that even the exist
ing defences of the country might be lost for want of funds to
preserve them—was Congress to be bound down by the effect
of the compromise act upon the law of 1832J   Taking for the
present, the 20pei cent inthecompromiseactas the limit and
the advalot em too, this bill did not trench upon that act Ifthe
argument against the bill was woith any thing, it was this
that lereaftei Congress could not move at all it was check
mated by two pieces, viz the law of 1832, and the law of 1833,
If that was to be the effect of the compromise act, then Mr   S
declared it plainly unconstitutional
Who weie the parties to it1* He did not speak of interests or
of individuals, still le s did he mean to impute wron? motives
to any one, but heaskedthe question Did any menibei ol this
House who was then a member bind himself or his successors
by that law? Mr S did not speak oí contracts where there
weie two parties, but simply of a law enacted for the good ol
the people of the Union, and involving no contract, but being
a mere expression of the legislative will, as this was In re
gard to such a law, what right had any member to bind his ow n
hands so that he was not perfectly free the very next day to
alter the law he had voted for? Or, however he migbtbiod
himself, what right had he to bind the Congress of the United
States? the people of the United States? Did gentlemen de
mand respect for the compromise act? With all his heait, he
was not deposed to interfere with it without the stiongpst and
most urgent necessity But suppose a case where a Senator
was instructed by his constituents to vote for something con
trary to that act, what answer could he give? Wo ild Ubesuf
ficient to say that he was one of tho<=e woo had vote I Or the
compi emise act? Did not gentlemen bee that the answer to such
an objection was plain?

rumors, which so afflict the gentleman fioto Viru nn «t th

influence of no one man or set of men sho  d he pei nutted to

enough for us to approve or disapprove them, when they are
expressed ex catherh a Called to lower, as the rre^.'ent
has been, bv the suffrage of the people and ihe act oi Provi
dence I will not indulge even the fear that he will be gniHy of
such an act of perfidy as to defeat the wishes and expectations
of the country I will not, for one moment, suppose that he
can bv any probability, be eo un¡u«t to tht peoHle or so amci
dal to himself When such an event üan pues we «halt not
be deficient in action, or fail to lnhilee the cc itleman in hlS
como amts, without interference fiom this side of the House
But be this as it may, what, Iinquue has it to do with the
hill now before the committee? Dops the gentle«ian fee! pro
scribed because he is asked to vste a suffinercy of revenue to
bear the expenses of Government? Did he feel pnjeubed
when asked, a few days ago, to vote a loan of twelve millions of
hilars to pay the debt of the last Administration^ Why sir,
itwoi the prodigality of the late Administration that brought
this into power, and shall we become equally obnoxious, by
refusing to pay the debts and sustain the credit of the nation"?
In giving my humble support to these measures, X feel that I
am carrying into eifect the known and expressed wishes of the
people In so doing I remember that they created me in my
capacity here, and I hope that the gentleman, and otheis m au-
thority, will, with me, not forget how soon we must surrender
the power with,which we are invested, to the source from
whence we derived it But what proscription for opinion can
justify the class of politicians to wmch the gentleman belongs
in their course during the present session 1 With what pro-
priety can they count themselves as the exclusive friends of
the Administration, while they oppose almost every one of its
leading measures—measures, without which there will be not
only no relief to a distiessed people, but no support for Govern-
ment—measures, without wmen the credit, and honor, and
safety, and defence of the nation will be le't without aid or pro
tion? Sir, such a com se will not bear the test of examination,
and theie can be no justification for it, except such as belongs
to the peculiar views of these gentlemen—a sort of political
asceticism which finds no affinity any where or with any thing
—it scarcely propagates its kind The geileman has, however,
sought a strange support to his peculiar position lie quotes
a text of Scripture If 1 can be permitted to reply m the same
vein, I would beg him, while groaning undei his heavy burden,
to remember that the same authority makes provision for those
only who are reviled and persecuted falsely. The exercises ot
the gentleman [Mr Gilmer] on this occasion, are not unlike
the contrivances which a certain chss of religionists are said to
have used for tormenting themselves One of these was to
cany a whip and to ask every passei by to scourge them with
it, that they might thus mheiit the blessings of persecution.
Does not the gentleman on this occasion assume asimilar cha-
racter?
liutenoueh of this for the present Leaving this region of
dreamy abstractions, let me call the attention of the committee
to the bill now under debate
The bill provides that, from and after the first day of Sep-
tember next, there shall be paid a duty of twenty per cent
ad valoiem on all articles which are now admitted free of du-
ty, or which are chargeable with a duty less than that pro
posed, excepting certain enumerated articles, the rates of duty
upon which are not disturbed, and certain other articles which
aieto íemam, as heretofore, free.
The sole object of the bill is to provide revenue It is based
chiefly upon the statements which accompany the letter of the
Secretary of the Treasury, and which are furnished the House
through the Committee ot Ways and Means And the present
and urgent necessity of the measure isdemongtiated by etatis
tics and arithmetical calculations easily understood and too
plain for mistake The chairman of the committee, [Mr Fill
moiie,] with his usual clearness and force, opened the whole
subject upon the introduction of the bill With a candor and
fairnebs which all accord to him, he demonstrated by figureb
and facts the urgent necessity of this measure of relief for the
country, and adduced in support of his position, arguments
winch are unanswered and unanswerable I will not be le
filmed to travel over the same ground he has so successfully
occupied, and will, therefore, only advert to a few results to 11*
gathered from the tables of the Secretary which have satisfied
my mmd of the true financial condition of the country, its pie
sent exigencies and probable future wants, and the absolute *
and contiolhng necessity winch demands, in the shape of aa
increase of duties, a new source of revenue.
The expendieres of the Government for the last four yeara
amounted to ©110 987,462, and which leaves an average for each
year of about $27,740,000 We have no íeason to believe that
this annual expenditure will be diminished for the ensuing four
years,but, on the contrary, there ia cause for the feai, as I
shall show Vioie I sit down, thatn will be most fearfully m-
ore-ised We will v^ume, however, for our present purpose,
that twenty eight millions of dolíais will be equal to the annual
< xpendi'uiefor the ensuing foui years
fhc question, then, lecurs, with what are we to meet this ex-
pend tuie? Will these v ho are opposed 10 thia bill inform us
