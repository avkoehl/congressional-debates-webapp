25th Cong-'"2nd Sess.
Reference of President's Message—Mr. Murray.
H. of Reps.
it it had been apprehended, it is questionable whe-
ther the Constitution of the United States, which
had so man} obstacles to encounter, would hav c
ventured to guard a¿amst it by an additional pio-
vwon A virtual, and it is hoped, an adequate
remedy may he> eafter be found m the i efusal of Stale
paper when debased m <i j of the Federal tians-
aciions "
Such was the opinion of Mr. Madison, who is
yet, I believe, acknowledged to bo good authority
with all partió , even witn those who have lost all
confidence m Mr Jefltrson On this point the
President seems to be well sustained by reason, by
sound policy, and b} one of the most able and pure
of American statesmen
It has been said that the " banks will be unable
to sustain themselves, unless they aie made the
depositories of the public moneys lhat their paper
will become disparaged and uncurrent, uti ess we
impart to them the credit of the Government " In
answer to this I will sa>, that if making the banks
the depositories of the public monejs Mould mili-
tate against either the safety of the Government
oi the prosperity of the people—by putting the
Government into the power of the banks m such
manner a-, to enable them to arrest and paralyze
all her eneigies, by w lthholdmg the deposites w hen
needed for the public welfare, as they might be
ptompted from interest or necessity—or if impart-
ing to them the Government credit would have a
tendency to piompt them to over banking, by in-
ducing them to rely too much upon that credit—I
would not make them depos tones, though their
stockholders sho ild be thereby benelited That
such would be the direct tendency, we aie admo-
nished by past experience and, as like causes
produce like effects, it 12 but a fair calculation to
make, that the same system would aga n pro luce
the same con=equeu es In the creation ot those
banks by the several States, the credit of the Go-
vernment was never contemplated as one of their
resources If their own, and such other resouices
as were contemplated in their creation, be insuffi-
cient to sustain them, their existence is an imposi-
tion upon the community m which they subsist,
and the sooner the} go down the better But is there
not a strong array of facts against the position of
those who assume that the Gov eminent credit is 1 e-
cessaiv to susta n the banks 1 Since the formation
of our Government, State b">nks have only been
1 ccasionall} resorted to as public depositories,
and peihaps their operations have never been
more injurious to the community or to their
own discredit, th m during those very periods
of their connection with the Government From
1791 up to 1811 thefiist Bank of the Unit d Slates
appears to have been the principal depository of the
Government funds After the expiration of its
charter, Stat" banks were selected as depositories,
and during the time of the performance of their
duties as such, they all suspended specie payi ents,
and involved the country in distress The late
Bank oi the United States and its branches were
the exclusive depositories oí the public moneys
fioml816to 1833, when the State banks were
again selected for depositories, and continued to be
erapUyed and to act as sUeh till May last, when
the same general suspension aga n took place, with
all our late and preset t disasters following in its
tram Duung the existence oí the Bank of the
United States the State banks were not only ex-
cluded (rom being public depositories, but then
strength was oveisnadowed, and then paper to a
great extent disparaged, by the operations ol •! e
Federal bank Yet, from the time of their reco-
ver} tiom the severe shock given to them by that
in tittttion, which ended with the disasters of 1819
and 1820, they coi tinned to prosper, and toper-
form their functions as banking institutions with
much better success than since they were last se-
lected as Governmert depositories The íeasons
are obvious They tnen saw the necessity of pro-
ceeding with caution and piudence,and of keeping
then operations within then resources, which
wholesome restiamts were all abandoied when
they came to rely on the money and credit oí the
Government But, furthermore, tl ere are now jn
¡he United States anout eight hundred banks No
one, I piesume, contemplates the employment of
them all as fiscal agenfs for the Government. Tne
late deposite banks amounted to some'hmg up-
watds of eighty m number, and I presume there
would not again be a greatei numbet employed
Theie wou d then be upwsie's oi seven hundred
banks, unpiovided for by the Government, to fur-
nish the countiy with the giealer part of its cucu-
lation, though laboring undei the disadvantage of
being excluded from privileges enjojed by the
banks selec ed, or else they must go down in con-
sequence of such exclusion, and leave then worth-
le s paper on the hands of a suffering community
Take eitherhorn of the dilemma, and the argument
of gen'lemen on this point must stand defeated It
is, therefore, my sincere convicUou lhat it is belter,
bo*h for ihe Gov eminent and ihe banks, that the se-
paiation take place, and, as the mutual friend of
both, 1 feel mvself bound to support the recom-
mendations oí th° Message
But, it is said, " that the recommendations of the
Piesidi"it, if adopted and car led out, will make
dangerous adcV ons to the patronage of the Execu-
tive, and, thtiuore, endanger the liberties of the
people "
Wow, it seems to r?e to be a problem not easily
solved, that ge ,tlemen who are m fav or of the esta-
blishment oí an irresponsible, overgrown bank
corporation, to have not only the custody and con-
trol of the whole of the public levenues, but the
pow er also to bieak down the State institutions at
will, and control the whole circulating medium of
the nation, and who aie well appnzed of the tre-
mendous influences which sucn an institution is
able to exeit ov.er the fouuneo and destinies of the
people, si otitd be so much alarm d and horriri°d
about Ú e dangei ot lequmng the officers ot the
Government, wh 1 already collect her moneys, and
are respf nsible ¡or tlie dischai t, of tieir duties, to
keep sifely these none}s collected by 'i em, for a
few wecKS or months, and pay them over at once
to the public creditois, instead of paying them over
10 the bank depositories Do we not know,
from expei icnce. an 3 observatu n, that no influence
coufd add so much to the powei of the Executive
as an alliance with the banking institutions of the
countr} Bank influence is always on the alert,
and never to be taken by surprise It is the most
subtle the most active, the most seductive, and I may
add, the most corrupting and dangerous of any influ-
ence under heaven Suppose an ambitious President
in league with the most pon erful bankinginslitutions
of the country, in consequence of their being the
public depositories The banks, 10 secure Executn e
favor and advancement, are willing to minister to
the wishes and ambition of the President Possessing
the control of the circulating medium of the country,
they at once have it in then power to unsettle
the value of the property and fu-tunes oí he peo-
ple—to oppress and overawe their debtois andde
pendants—to alarm the timid—to bribe tne \ena!
and corrupt—ir> interfere in the elections and sub-
sidise the press—combining altogether a concentra-
t on oí powei, than which it would be difficult to
conceive of an} thing which could be more alarm-
ing to the jealous defenders or civil liberty Let
it nx be said tnat wc shall alwa}s fine'sufficientse-
cuuty against such dangers in the -virtue and intel-
ligence of the people That is an argument which
will cut both ways, and be as much against as in
favor of the pos inn of gentlemen It will applv
with ti\ 1 foice against the supposed dangcis of
the svste i) lecominended 111 the Message Such
an argument, however, though <ilw?vs forcible and
entitled to great consideration, is neveilheless xeiv
iai tiom being conclusive and irresistible I tell
joj si,, lhat the splendoi and eclat oe a great
man's narre, «Iw his caieer is marked and at-
tended witn the tri mphal car oí success, alwa}s
begei m the piopl  admiration and attachment,
so much so that he will seldom be deserted b} the
people The leader of a revolution, if it fails to
sun eed, becomes a rebel, and the penalties of a
tiaitor are denounced against him. If successful,
he becomes a great patriot, and the fatner ol his
countrj's liberties Even the plunderer of man-
kind is said to be made or unmade by the caprice
of ¡ortune If his career consist in heading a
bandut , he sinks into an extern robber, and is
banged for his uime*-     if m loading a victorious
army, and commanding the destinies of nations,
he is dignified with the title of hero, and admira-
tion renders his name immortal. Day after day
are we lectuied on the subject of the aggression
and dangerous march of Executive power Yet
the late and present Execuuve have always bad
arrayed against them the bank influence of the
country The struggle between the laie Ffesi-
dent and the Bank of the United States was long
and tremendous, it was kuch as will be chronicled
in our histoiy, as one of the most memorable.strug-
gles of oui couniry—a stiuggle that exhibits the
high and noble example of an American Presi-
dent periling himself to save his country from
being triumphed over by a powerful bank influence,
when by propitiating that influence, he could no
doubthavc secured himsclfm the Presidential chair,
as long as ambition could have desired Suppose a
different kind of man had been Presiden', or rather
suppose the President the same man, with all his
ex raoidmary advantages but metamorphosed mto
a different character,with the desires and ambition
of an usurper Suppose him young and daring,
and ambitious, panting like Ca;sar or Cromwell
for power and politic" 1 glory, and, once obtaining
power, determining nevei again to surrender ¡X.
Such a President would have lost no time in en-
listing in his support such an irresistible and pow-
erful ally, Possessed of the double influence of the
bank interest, and his own extraordinary weight
of character, he wenikt- have kept steadily m view
a continued íncr  ase and accumulation of that m-
fience, until the ptop'e would have been shackled
with the bonds c I slavery, lie would have pro-
cured from Congiess arechaitei of the institution,
with additional giants of powir, fiisl perhaps for a
definite but at length lor an inde'mi e period, pro-
caanj lio n tune tu t '¡it ddilii nal granls 0/ pow-
er, aseveiy addition o1 strength given to the bank
would a! 0 bean addition of power to the Execu-
tiv e arm The bank, knowing veil its stay and sup-
port, would always be ready to minister to his ambi-
tion or his vengeance Such being the ease, theCatos
of American freedom might m vammake a show of
resistance Their puny and inefficient efforts
would soon be quelled In vain might the people
mourn the subveision of th ir institutions, and
sigh ovei then liberties lost, and gone for
ever Do yon think, sir, this picture is alto-
gether imaginary? Consult the pages of hts-
torj, and you will find that examples are
abundant to \ arn you of such dangers It
is important, sir, that the Government should
have the control of her depositories It should
never be 111 the power of the banks to control the
Government, ner should the Government have de-
positories which she is unable to control. The
people, through then Government, should keep all
powei within then own hands, and any delegation
oí pow crs to f thers, in such manner as to put the
poweis delegated beyond thecontiol of the people's
repiesentatives in Congiess, is, at first blush, a vio-
lation of the doctrines of democraev. Those-doc-
tunes always contemplate that the people shall
reserv e to themselves at least a supervisoiy power
to control the action of their representatives in
Congress, and an} delegation of power by Con-
giess, whelhei te coiporations or otheis, placing it
be} ond the p6vci ot the people to exercise such
sup^rvi or} coitiol, is a violation of the doctrines
ot demotiacv To tho e uoctinvs I am bound to
