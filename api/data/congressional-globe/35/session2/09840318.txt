<oI<1 me lhat Mr- Turner would be

C^ito«UgYouwent round md collected the contri-
butions?
<f4ftnswcr. Yes, sir. .. .
"Question. Did all tlie men contribute >
" jlnswer. I do not believe there was any who did not.
" Question. Was there any objection made by the men
when this contribution was
■-nllected; but afterwards, the following pay day, they had
this other tax to pay for him'to go to Washington, and they
^mniained of being taxed again.
c " How was this regarded by the men; as a
tux or as a compliment to Mr. Turner.
" Answer, I think, if the men were left voluntarily to
themselves, they would not have done it. They did it merely
through fear that, as some few had started "> ■f,11"- otliera
did not encourage it they would be discharged.
A short time afterwards, a contribution of nine-
ty-four dollars was collected from the men to pay
mi*. Turner's expenses to Washington, undei
the pretext that he could get the pay of the men
raised. Still another collection, of fifty-eight or
sixty dollars, was taken to defray election ex-
penses. All thcse-contributions were collected
between April 1, 1858, and the November elec-
tion, and from common workmen, whose wages
were alleged to be inadequate. Master workmen
testified before your committee with their " testi-
monials " on their persons. The only case of a
refusal of such a donation, brought to the notice
of vour committee, was that of Alexander Ward,
master of laborers. Shortly after he went .into
the yard, about one hundred dollars were co.-
lected to be'used in the usual way, before he
heard of it. He had the money returned to the
men, who were then receiving but $1 12J a day.
In another case, about one hundred dollais were
raised by men under Mr. Graham, to aid in the
election of Mr. Sickles, which Mr. Graham,
when he learned of it, caused-to be returned to
the men. .
These abuses increased m the yard as the elec-
tion for members of Congress approached. Mem-
bers, master workmen, all were interested m
packing the yard. If the master workman was
reluctant to increase his force, he was urged to
do so by the members of Congress,and was com-
pelled to yield to the demand. In this way the
master-biacksmith increased his force twenty-five
men. He testified that the same general increase,
for the same reason, occurred throughout the
yard in all the different departments; and that of
the force of about two thousand four hundred
men thus employed one fourth were useless; that
it was understood that particular mastei work-
men were to administer this patronage for the
benefit of particular members. In most cases this
pressure was yielded to with alacrity, and a tem-
porary pressure of work in September, 1848, to
fit out the Niagara for Africa, and which lasted
for four days only, was made the pretext for re-
taining men aftei they weie no longer needed.
Insubordination increased; m one case the master
laborer and a number of men answered roll-call,
and went to the primary election in Mr. Sickles s
district, and yet drew full pay. A short time be-
fore the election the men got to leaving off twenty
to thirty minutes before bell-ring in the evening,
and would collect near the gate ready to go out
of the yard. Commander Rootes attempted to
stop this; as soon as he got near them between
the ship-houses, some of them, in large gangs,
san"- out his name, and hooted and hissed him. j
The" only reason given by Commander Rootes :
was, that the men thought that the members of j
Congress put then, there and could keep them '
there in defiance of the officers of the yard.
The same pressure to increase the force was
brought to bear upon the naval officers of the yard;
when Commander Rootes sought to remove some
of the men after the Niagara had sailed, the mas-
ter workmen always managed to find something
to do. He had no power to remove the master
workmen, but could complain of them, ami sus-
pend them until an order was received from the
Department. If this power was exercised, the
result was that the delinquent was soon restored
to duty. A short lime before the election, Mr.
Searing applied to Commander Rootes to employ
some two or three men. He replied tiiat he could
not do it, the orders were against it; the mas-
ters had that privilege. Mr. Turner, the master
painter, was present, anfl he sa'd that it was all
' important to have these men in the yard, that
1 they could carry a great number of votes, and had
a good deal of influence, and it was necessary for
the nomination of Mr. Searing. A few days be-
fore the election, Mr. Taylor uiged Commodore
• Kearny to take in a number of men. At this
| period, on the 27th of October, 1858, when the
j public welfare demanded the vigilance of the offi-
cers of the yard, Commodore Kearny was relieved
from duty, and Commander Rootes was summa-
rily detached and ordered to Washington by the
Secretary of the Navy. Commodore Kearny was
left in the yard until his successor arrived. Their
successors'could not and did not assume their ac-
tive duties until after the election. This order
was unusual, without motive, and no reason has
yet been assigned.

men employed at the several navy-yards m each

Note.—Tlie rolls for the navy-yard at Mare Island are rendered for the entire month,
It thus appears, that the number of employes
in the navv-yards December 1, 1857, was 7,113;
May 1, 1858, 6,697; November 1, 1858, 10,038.
The chief increase was at Brooklyn and Phila-
delphia. In Brooklyn the number, December 1,
1857, was 1,479; May 1, 1858,1,379; November
1 1858, 2,4S8, or an increase of 1,109 men m five
months. In Philadelphia the number, December
1,1857, was 646; May 1,1858, 1,064; November
1 1858, 1,541. During the month of October it
ranged from 1,685 to 1,722—an increase of over
six hundred in four months. _
It will be perceived that the highest numbei at
New York was about the 1st of November, and
at Philadelphia about the middle of October.
The undersigned find that abuses in the Brook-
lyn navy-yard are not confined to master woik-
men and their men, but extend to all the civil de-
partments of the yard.
THE NAVY AGENT.
George N. Sanders, the navy agent at New
York, disburses about four million dollars annu-
ally. By law he is appointed for four years, but
removable from office at pleasure. His salary is
not to exceed $3,000 per annum. His duties are
not prescribed by law, but are fixed by regula-
tions' of the Department. He is therefore, as to
term of office and duty, entirely subjcct to the
discretion of the Executive. By the act of March
3, ]843,all materials, of whatever name or nature,
for the use of the Navy, when time will permit,
shall be furnished by contract by the lowest bid-
! der.
: Fiul and a few other specified articles are
j exempted by subsequent laws. Contracts are
i annually made by the different bureaus foi the
' articles supposed to be wanted; but articles are
! often needed not embraced in the contract. Un-
i der the implication arising from the words, "when
i time will permit," if articles not covered by the
! contracts and not in the navy stores are needed,
1 they are bought by " open purchase," under the
I direction of the Navy Department. The navy
I agent, among his other duties prescribed by the
1 Department, pays for all articles purchased at
New York by contract, and makes all open pur-
| chases.
; AH the articles were purchased upon the as-
I sumption that time would not admit of their being
'■ purchased by contract. The evidence clearly
shows that articles thus purchased were bought
I at a much higher rate than the contract price.
' Thus, iron of prescribed sizes in 1858, was three
and a half cents per pound by contract. Yet a
quantity of iron for hooping the spars of the frig-
ate Congress was needed. There was a slight
variation in the size of the iron from that furnished
by contract of the two thousand pounds required.
, One thousand eigh t hundred and thirty-five pounds
i were bought on open purchase at five and a quar-
ter cents per pound.
When articles are needed not embraced in a con-
tract, a requisition is made out by the master work-
man, certified to by the constructing engineer or
naval constructor, as the case may be, and com-
mandantof the yard, and sent to the Navy agent.
It then becomes his duty to enter the market and
purchase the article needed at its fair market value.
Instead of this being done in the city of New
York, the requisitions are generally handed over
to Charles A. Secor & Co., ship chandlers, of
New York, and they furnish the article. One of
the firm is the security for Mr. Sanders on his
official bond, and is his intimate and confidential
friend. The articles called for are furnished by
them, whether within the line of their business
or not, and sent directly to the yard. The Navy
agent has followed this course during his term,
and never sees the articles, fixes their prices, or
knows when, of whom, or at what prices, Secor
gets them; and yet claims that he is appointed
to make the purchase, and is accountable for the
prices.—Commodore Smith.
When the articles reach the yard a junior officer
of the yard inspects them, to sec if they are good,
and to satisfy himself if they are charged at fair
market prices. To do that he sometimes has
sent to the city of New York to make inquiries,
but usually he took the price presumed to have
been agreed upon by the navy agent as the fair
market price. Commander Rootes testifies that
11 they had a great deal of trouble with Mr. Secor,
I! and" that everything furnished to the navy-yard by
II Secor & Co., while he was there, had been far
!i above market prices, and so he wrote to the De-
ll partment. Lieutenant Barnet, for some time the
:i inspecting officer, makes the same statemei't.
Several instances are shown in the testimony and
in Commander Rootes's correspondence with the
Department where the price was exorbitant. In
j such cases the article was rejected; but, as the
! officer did not purchase the article, and was not
| informed in regard to prices, it usually passed
into the store-house, and thereupon Secor got his
pay of the navy agent.
When the attention of Commodore Smith, of
" the bureau of yards and docks, was called to the
