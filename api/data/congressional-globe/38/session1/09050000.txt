JVIr. BLAIR, of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, U ■
is not my purpose to criticisc the iiguies produod i
by the gentleman from New York, [Mr. Brooks.]
Unfortunately, the condition of things complained i
of could not at once be changed. It is impossible '
to provenf nations professing; to be neutral from
sending: vessels to depredate upon our commerce. ;
It was impossible, at the commencement of the ;
war, when the Buchanan Administration had scat-1
53
tered the naval vessels in all parts of the earth, j
to have as efficient a Navy as the exigency de- J
manded. |
j But, sir, I have myself witnessed the efficiency '
i of the Navy Department upon the western waieis. [
i We have seen its efficiency in preventing the iron- j
; clads built by the confederates ftom coming out [
i to sea from the Atlantic ports. 1 believe the na- j
[ tion has cause to be proud of the administration ,
[ of the Navy Department. I
I I do not intend to reflect upon any gentleman, I
much less upon any of our gallant officers. I do
not intend to cast any reflection upon the officer
alluded to by the gentleman from Maryland, but
at the same time I think the remarks of the gen-
tleman in regard to the management of the Navy
Department were totally unmeiited. Sir, the
"cotton-spinner," to whom the ^gentlemun al-
ludes, is well kik'Wii m his profession as eminent
as is the officer to whom he alludes and to whoni
he gives such lofty praise. He is as gallant in
his bearing, has risked as much during this rebel-
