Colonel GANSEVOORT,

Commanding at Ball's Hill, Va.:

Mr. Dennis Ormsby, who resides near Dranesville, informs me that he knows of about thirty or forty guerrillas who stay habitually in and about Dranesville, and that he knows of many of their stopping places. He offers to conduct a party to capture them. He will come to you to-morrow. I wish you to make arrangements to have a party to go out to-morrow night for the purpose of taking or destroying this gang. Mr. Ormsby will accompany it. Select a good officer to command, and to be with him and Mr. Ormsby together before they start, and see that all is well understood and arranged.

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, Commanding.

C. GROVER,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., January 4, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

In pursuance of your instructions, I totally inhibited the passing of citizens and goods across the Potomac. I am to-day advised by the provost-marshal at Berlin that General Devin is giving such permits. I advise you of his action, it seeming to me to be without authority. I think the power over trade should not be exercised by General Devin, as it would only tend to complicate the subject with my subordinates, whose action, when exclusively under my control, I can be responsible for, holding them strictly to your wishes on the subject.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
