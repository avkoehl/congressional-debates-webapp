the condition of affairs beyond Bay's Mountain. My own belief it that Longstreet is gone, and that Buckner is left in command of whatever force remains. Upon examination it is found that the small trestle bridge at Mossy Creek was partially cut by the rebel s with the intent doubtless to make a trap for our first train. I have directed, if possible. I would suggest the examination of the whole line above the Plains wherever there is a bridge or wooden culvert.

The troops at Mossy Creek have an average of 70 founds of musket ammunition, and Wood's from 40 to 50. The Ninth Corps and Wood's have some at Strawberry Plains. I telegraphed General Potter this morning the amount of cannot ammunition. General Stoneman reports that some riding animals could be bought at less than common Government rates in the country, and I have directed him to let his corps quartermaster make the purchases and turn the animals over, for the present, to the dismounted officers. Do you approve this? It will somewhat diminish the number to be furnished.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
