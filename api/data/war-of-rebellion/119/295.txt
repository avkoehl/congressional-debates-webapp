OFFICE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS,

Richmond, Va., September 21, 1863.

Respectfully returned to Brigadier General S. A. Meredith, agent for exchange of prisoners.

I am perfectly satisfied, from diligent inquiry, that there is no foundation for the charge that Johnson's treatment has been "horrible," or in any manner has been different from that of other prisoners confined at Castle Thunder. I refer you to Rev. Mr. Scandlin for the facts in this regard, as stated by Johnson himself.

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
