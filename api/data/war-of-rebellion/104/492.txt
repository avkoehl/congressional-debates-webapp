MOUNT STERLING, April 27, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

They will accept the terms, if the officers will be allowed their horses.

H. N. BENJAMIN.

LEXINGTON, KY., April 27, 1865.

Major BENJAMIN,

Mount Sterling, Ky.:

The terms sent this morning are an ultimatum. After surrender the officers may be treated liberally, and probably will, as regard horses. Several officers of the command have taken the amnesty oath here to day, and the two with the flag can do the same. Cannot be paroled. These are considered very liberal terms, and may not be extended hereafter.

By order of Brigadier-General Hobson:

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MOUNT STERLING, KY., April 27, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The major-general commanding the flag says he cannot accept the terms, but will take a copy of the terms and submit it to Colonel Giltner, commanding division, C. S. Army. Shall I send an officer and escort through with them? They wish to start in the morning. Please give me instructions.

H. N. BENJAMIN,

Major, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, April 27, 1865.

Major H. N. BENJAMIN,

Mount Sterling, Ky.:

Send a flag of truce and twenty-five men under good officer to escort rebel flag not farther than West Liberty or Hazel Green, if the rebels should be that far. Let the officer be intelligent and prudent enough to learn near the force they have. In the meantime more troops are being sent you.

By order of Brigadier-General Hobson:

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MOUNT STERLING, April 27, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The rebels are said to be about eighteen miles from here, in force, I am informed.

H. N. BENJAMIN,

Major, Commanding.
