Referred for the special attention of the Quartermaster-General, Commissary-General, Ordnance Bureau, Surgeon-General, and Niter and Mining Bureau. It will be necessary to limit estimates, and, as far as the service will allow, anticipative purchase of supplies.

At no distant date means of shipment ought to be largely increased, and I have all confidence they will be, both by the Government and private parties.

Hon. G. A. TRENHOLM,

Secretary of the Treasury:

SIR: I have the honor to return herewith the estimates made by the various bureaus of the War Department of the amount of foreign funds required by them in the next six months to meet their wants abroad. These estimates are as follows:

Quartermaster's Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &amp;570,000

Commissary Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 511,000

Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,491,000
