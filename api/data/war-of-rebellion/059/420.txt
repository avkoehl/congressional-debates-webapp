CAIRO, April 19, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.;

Your plan of operations received. I think Forrest will be south of the Hatchie before the movements can be made. He is moving off with his plunder. Do you wish me to forward copy to General Hurlbut at Memphis? I have some information of an attempt upon communications by the rivers and the Nashville road.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General.

CAIRO, ILL., April 19, 1864.

(Received 20th.)

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

Captain Pennock has unofficial letter from Red River, from which it appears that Banks and Smith had a severe battle with heavy loss near Mansfield, below Shreveport, receiving a check, but beating off the enemy. This may delay the return of Smith. We expect more authentic accounts to-morrow. Particulars are given, but not entirely reliable.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Numbers 8. Nashville, Tenn., April 19, 1864.

I. Provisions will no longer be issued to citizens at military posts south of Nashville. When citizens cannot procure provisions in the country there is no alternative but they must remove to the rear.

II. Provisions must not be sold to any persons save officers in the service of the United States, and the hired men employed by the quartermaster's or other departments of the Government, at a rate not to exceed one ration per day. Commanding officers will give their personal attention to this matter, as it is of vital importance. It is idle for us to be pushing forward subsistence stores if they are lavished and expended on any persons except they belong to the army proper.

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:

R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
