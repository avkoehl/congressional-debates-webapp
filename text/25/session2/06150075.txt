APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSÍONAL GLOBE.
f 
25th Cong-«"2nc Sess.
Suppression of Indian hostilities—Mr. Bynum.
H. of Reps,
had no apologies to make He thought when
the letter wa? written, as he did now, that it came
m a questionable shape He had seen a Wt<-r,
however, irom General Jesup, in which he thought
he had acted with some magnanimity, and had
made an atonement for much of the offensiveness of
that letter
But so far as Gen Jackson's conduct was con-
cerned in relation to lhat matter, however, he
stood there ready to derend every particle of it
Never had he in any part of his life, in his Mr
B's opinion, acted with more propriety than on
that occasion It was well known there and else-
where, that the most unfounded rumors had reach-
ed here, and responded to, and circulated with eager-
ness, by this very Opposition, prejudicial and con-
demnatory of the course that General Scott had pur-
sued m Florida, in fact, it had been carried so high
in the South, that he had understood in some part of
Florida General Scott had actually been burnt m ef-
figy, or offered some other indignity, perhaps
at or near Tallahassee, and he believed that
presses of the Opposition and the Whig party
had already began to denounce his campaign
on that floor, about which the memorable letter
had been written by General Jesup to Mr. Blair,
with a request that it be shown to the President,
which at once gave to the charge a responsible
name, with time, place, and date He would not
again speak of the propriety of that letter, but the
President had deemed it his duty to act then on the
subject, and to place in command another, until an
investigation had taken place In do ng that, he
said, Gen Jackson had sustained his high charac-
ter for promptitude and efficiency, and it would
have been unworthy of the high character he bore,
both as a statesman and soldier, to have done other
wise, and if there was blame to be attached any
where, it was paitly to this House, to the public,
and to general Jesup, and not a paiticle to Gene-
ral Jackson
Mr. B said he himself had no faith in those
lea-party Generals, that lounged and hung about
the courts of Washington He thought they had
become (if he could be allowed the expression)
effeminated and enervated by dancing attendance at
the Washington coteries, with sword and epaulette
He believed it an imposition upon the Government
to keep them here, and would go as far as any man
m cortectmg this e\ il Such men were not fit for
service, but upon that subject he hoped to say more
at another time
I will go as far as any man in erasing from the
lolls of jour army the names of your coterie and
ball-ioom chieftains
Something had been said about raising a com-
mittee to investigate the abuses of the Florida cam-
í aigns, and he once had entertained some idea ot
v olmg for such a proposition, but, upon mature re-
jection, he had become perfectly satisfied that the
■whole scheme, for the present at l«ast, was suicidal,
v -ould be pregnant with the most disastrous conse-
quences, both to the army and the public interests
What, (said he,) upon the field of battle, amidst the
taking of blood and stamp of the war horse, to «top
11 inquire after abuse and failures No, sir, no, sir
it will breed distrust m your camp, unneive the arm
of your stoutest soldier, and paral} zee very effort of
your generals, lead to doubt and defeat, and final-
1} to that very disgrace that gentlemen had dis-
c lursed of so learnedly and volubly Let the w ar be
e ided, c*nquer jour enemy, and he would then
and there, m his place, pledge himself to go with
auv man, or with any parly, m ferreting out
abuses—as far as he who would dare go farthest,
but until then, he should view an> attempt of the
kind unwise, impolitic, and fraught with the most
disastrous consequences The wisest of men had
said—-it was written in holy writ, he believed—that
"there «as a time for all thing-," and never did a
pieverb more st ictly ipply to an} occasion than
that did to the present It was that kind of suici-
dal poUcj that had overthrown great Carthage,
Alric'b imperial city, when basking in the sun-
shine of her high prosperity, and competing for
empire with her great rival It was ihat kind of
policy that had humbled Caithage, and prostrated
her at the feet of her imperial mistress, the Repub-
lic of Borne.   Who does not recollect, that is hen
hei conquering general was marching on, and in
tht vei j act ot Hying hand  on the gate  of Rome,
ho was arre' tl by the fell demon of party spirit,
an 1 recalled to Africa by the schisms of party, and
the influence of faction, for which misdeed Car-
thage had been long buried beneath the ruins in-
flicted by her conqueror's arms, and the name of
Oaithagmian liberty had long since been erased
from the history of the world
Yes, nr, the great Hannibal 'and his army, he
feaied, had been recalled from Rome, when, in
the act of humbling tnat haughty Republic, by the
same sp nt which had prompted the attempt to recall
o u armies from Florida How near the ultimate
consequence j might prove the same, his ory and
tuno alone would declare The policv, in his judg-
ment, was damning—the idea preposterous The
Seminole Indians must be humbled, conquered,
brought in subjection, or we invite a fruitful har-
vest of Indian wars L°t no man think for a mo-
ment otherwise, and when our victories are pro-
claimed, and not until then, let us think of investi-
gations Then let us cashier and impeach the
timid and imbecile, but reward with laurels the
brow of the gallant and the brave.
He had been utterly astonished and confounded
at the sentiments of honorable gentlemen expressed
on that occasion, that we should now make peace
with the Indians, and pay them a boon, a tribute,
to move away, to cease to harass and murder the
people of Florida and our frontiers Such senti-
ments were too revolting When would ever
such a craven policy be adopted by the brava and
free ríen of this nation'2 Never Never, in God's
name, let it be said that this proud and mighty
nation should be so humbled, and by a handfull of
savages, as to buy their peace The mighty genius
of liberty snrunk at the idea, and our patriotism
stood rebuked b} tne spirit of our father* and the
god of our freedom Sir, had that Roman exam-
ple been lost sight of m the scramble and heat of
party spirit? Had we already forgot that when.
Brennus of old, with his Goths, were at the gates of
Rome, demanding tribute, and the cowardly pol-
troons of the city were in the very act of weighing
out to them their gold, and when that gold was
even exhausted, and the cry rung through the
crowd, what shall we do for more to throw in the
scale to make the weight, when the cry reached
the ears of old Camillus, he, with godlike mien,
hobbled forth, with his sword in one hand, and his
crutch in the othei, and when arriving at the place,
thiew into the lightei, empty scale, the sword of his
\outh, and swore that, m the hands of the valiant,
it was of more weight tnan all the gold of Europe
A spectacle so sublime penetrated each Roman
bosom, flushed with such patriotic devotion, ever}
citizen and soldiei flew to their sabre1:, and with
the fur} of despeiation fell on their Gothic be-
siegers with vengeance and death, and ceased not
their havoc until e\ erj oarbanan had been driven
from the remo'est confines of their territon
Honorable gentlemen had dwelt with peculiar
delight upon indrv idua.1 cases of defalcations and
failures The illiberalit} and injustice of attaching
them to the Administration, had been most trium-
phantlv responded to by the honorable delegate
from Florida, (Mr. Downing ) It was as unjust
as it was impracticable, to attempt to hold the Ad
ministration responsible for every individual failure
or defalcation The Government, from the ver}
nature of things, w as compelled to truit to its offi-
cer*, and vvhether they prov ed delinquent or coa-
ardl}, the fault could not properly attach to the Go-
vernraert
But it had been taurtingl} asktd, am< he
thought, too, wiih lather an an of triumph, by
both the honoiable gentle nan fi^ni Pennsjhania,
(Mr Biddle ) and the honoiab'e gentleman fron
Vermont, (Mr Everett,) whv should this war be
c-nried on? Mi B wojld answer for even reason
of sacred honoi, nccess tv, and sel -p-oiccüon abo c
ill Sn, slid he vv ih whatgraOP, with nhil police,
could we nou vvihdraw our arrrv from 11< rid ?
Whit are our obi gations to profact the exposed in-
habitan s of that Termor} ? Surely all that is ti-
ered, and is calculated to influence the action of
men'or nations, should prompt us to a speedy and
determined resolution not only to defend, but res-
cue that Territory at every hazard, and at any
price, from the blood-stained hands of these unre-
lenting savages Gentlemen surely sould not be in
earnest to talk o  peace, until these bloody, jperfi-
dious, treacherous devils were whipped into me*
sures Do they not know that a failure m punish-
ing and humbling these Seminóles, however fierce
they may be, or at whatever price, whether of blood
or treasure, would multiply, to an unfortunate num-
ber, the Indian wars on our south and southwestern
frontiers?
Sir, it would be ODly holding out to them an addi-
tional price to engage m them Can any gentle-
man who thus contends, not foresee that such a
course would be pregnant with the most disastrous
events that have ever befallen this nation? Would
not every tribe, however diminutive and contemp-
tible we might heretofore have viewed them,
be induced to follow the example of the Semi-
nóles, and wage war immediately on oui defence-
less frontiers lor tribute
Let gentlemen pause and reflect well before
they give utterance to such an idea Let them
hasten to review the false position that they are
about to occupy Let them for amomentcease their
party strife, and devote but a siugle glance on. the
interest of their mother country, on which they
were about to inflict this parricidal wound. Sir,
the blindness of party prejudice is no apology
for the sacrifice oí the public good. Wounds in-
flicted by party rancor on a suflenng country,
can never be sanctioned by the voice of a disinte-
rested patriotism The best interests oí our coun-
try, by the adopnon of such a course, would not
only be sacrificed, but the most indelible stain in-
flicted on our national honor The \ ery proposi-
t on, to him, was humiliating indeed, and well cal-
culated to wound the feelings of every high-minded
American It was a proposition to desert our ow n
soil, andsunender it up to the Semmolts—a pitiful,
contemptible band of savages, leaving the whole
settlement ot Florida exposed to the mercy of the
savages, and w hen had they shown mercy to a
white man? The whole scheme of the opposition
to the appropriation for thepiosecutwn of that war,
was fraught with the most serious and alarming
mischiefs, in whatever light we might be disposed
to view it
Sir, one gentleman had gone so fai as to reeom-
mená an appropriation oi some three or four mil-
lions of dollars to give them to leave off fighting,
and to move away, thus paying them a tribute
by a most disgraceful purchase of a peace, a pro-
position so monstious, that every true American
should revolt at it, as a foul sUgma thrown at his
country's honor From what part}, he would ask,
hid sucn sentiments been avowed there? Thanks to
his God, it had come not from any msmber of the
Democratic party, with w hom he acted on that floor,
and he should feel humbled, if not degraded and
disgraced—}es, "disgjaced," (something to which,
pre entiy, he would iepl},) had any member of a
party to which lit belonged held iorth such lan-
guage in the councils of the nation? What, sir,
pay tribute for peace? When was such a sentiment
avowed here, and from whence had it come? Had
gentlemen forgotten the language that had been
held and consecrated by the gallant, the wise,
and the brave, almost of every nation that could
boast ol its independence? Had they forgotten the
morsi of the sirgle expression, " Millionsfoi de-
jerue,but not one centfoi tiiovW" He would re-
commend, with profound deference, its moral to
the consideration and soluaon of certain honorable
gentlemen of that House Such an adage could
never lose its vveight with an astute, brave peo-
ple, until their enure sense oí selt-resp ct and sa-
gacity were obliterated bj the blindness of party
rancor Such sentiments, recommend?tor> ot the
pajment of tribute, or ot the purchase ot peace,
coa d not but be D^anded w h ie, robation by the
brave, patriotic people ot all America He be-
lieved that me} vv ou J put their mark on them at
once, vi hen and u herevei the} we.e expressed, un-
less b} or beiy and corruption th 1} were willing to
s h their p uno ism to a moneyed monster, lhat was
alike indifferent to honor, patriotism, and to
liberty
Much had been said about the disgrace of the
