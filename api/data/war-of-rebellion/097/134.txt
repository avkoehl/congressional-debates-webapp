General AYRES:

Followed General Crawford as as as the Gurley house if you get no other orders. Send a staff officer to General Meade's headquarters for instructions as to where you may be needed. I am somewhat uncertain whether there will not be a strong demonstration up the Halifax road, and shall keep Griffin at the Wyatt house until infantry needed elsewhere. I have sent my escort down the Halifax road to reconnoiter beyond our picket-line.

G. K. WARREN.,
