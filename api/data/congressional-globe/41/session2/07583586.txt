THE CONGRESSIONAL G-LOBE.
May 18,
they did not send out invitations to prominent
men. But they inserted notices in the news-
papers inviting all who were interested in ship-
building and the carrying trade to come before
the committee and give their testimony. Now,
Mr. Speaker, what was the nature of the tes-
timony laid before them. You will find by this
report that it was the universal sentiment of
the builders and owners, the merchants, as
well as the constructors, that the only way to
build up the American carrying trade was to
have it done by American seamen in American-
built ships. In the city of New York we had
one man before us who stated to the commit-
tee that we could not build ships in this coun-
try, but must go abroad and buy them. We
had one man who represented the Ship-owners'
Association on the questions under discussion,
who said that we could not build ships here,
but must buy them abroad. But I will say,
Mr. Speaker, and I will speak frankly upon
this matter, because there has been quite an
influence broughtto bear on this House in refer-
ence to this idea—it seems this man was directly
interested in British ships. So it was very easily
explained why he desired that we should patron-
ize British subjects in having our ships built
on British soil.
In Boston we found a gentleman who advo-
cated the idea of free trade in ships. All others
who appeared before the committee, merchants
and builders alike, said, "Do not go abroad to
buy ships; we can build them here; all we want
is cheap material." I shall speak upon that
branch of the subject further on. In Portland
there was the same expression of opinion. Only
one man there wanted free trade in ships, and
he proved to have been an arrant rebel during
the war. It seems he had aided and comforted
all he could by word and act the southern con-
federacy during our civil war—and he was the
only one who wanted free trade in ships. As
regards Philadelphia, I think there may possi-
bly have been one man there who advocated
that idea. I was not in that city when the com-
mittee met, and accordingly I am not positive
how it was in that locality.
Now, it would be useless for me to occupy
the time of this House in stating to you the
condition of our ship-building interest. Every
gentleman here know8 what its condition is.
You know that our ship-building interests are
almost ruined, our large machine-shops are
being sold, and that those not already sold will
have to be disposed of in a short time unless
there is a revival of business. I have made an
estimate of the amount of property now lying
idle in the country that was once engaged in
the ship-building interest, and I venture to say
that $30,000,000 worth of property is in that
condition for want of business in this depart-
ment of industry, property that was once thriv-
ing, large ship-yards that once had vessels being
built in them and thousands of men employed.
Machine-shops also, in which thousands of
men were once employed, are now lying idle
and have nothing to do. Now, let me suppose
an instance, and imagine what the legislation
of Congress would be. Suppose that the farms
of the West were blighted, that grass or grain
would not grow on them, and that the farmers
would be driven to starvation, what would be
done in that case? Why, there would be called
an extra session of Congress if necessary, and
laws would be enacted, rivers would be turned
from their course, and those farms would be
forced to grow crops if legislation could do it;
the farmer would be protected, and there is no
man iu this country who would not say but
that such legislation would be rightaud proper.
The greatcity of New York, which I have the
honor in part to represent, would give of her
millions to those farmers and others in their dis-
tress. And not only the farmers, but any other in-
terest that suffered would be cared for. We have
seen enough in this House within the last few
months to show us that every other interest has
been protected that could be protected and that
asked for protection from the Committee of
Ways and Means. I have no particular fault
to find with that. If we are to have protection,
why, I suppose we must have it, though of
course it is not the policy of the party that I
! represent.
j Now, sir, it has been said that this interest
i is a local interest. Sir, it is not local. It
| extends from Maine to Oregon. It reaches up
' all our beautiful rivers, and is upon all our
I lakes. It is not local. This bill does not ask
i protection for the State of Maine or the State
1 of Delaware, or the State of New York, or for
( some large iron manufactory in Pennsylvania,
or for some large cloth manufactory in Massa-
chusetts. It asks for protection for an interest
; all over the land, an interest that has brought
millions of money to our Treasury, an interest
, that has built up our pride, and extended our
flag all over the world.
Sir, the committee show in their report that
our ships are not owned by the princely mer-
chant alone 5 they are owned by mechanics as
well as merchants; by ship-wrights and ship-
chandlers; and by every man that has had any-
thing to do with their construction. These
men are owners as well as builders. I think
I have made thi3 matter clear. I trust I have
satisfied the House that this is not a local
interest.
Another thought which I would like to im-
press upon the House is that this ship-building
interest is not as small an interest as some have
supposed. It is an immense interest and is con-
nected directly with the navigation interest,
because, as I stated before, the ship-builder is
the ship owner in part, and consequently he
becomes interested in navigation. The navi-
gation interest gives employment to hundreds
and thousands of our American citizens as
captains, sailors, engineers, and firemen. It
has in times past given employment to a large
number of men in the foreign trade, but whose
places are now filled by citizens of other coun-
tries. I have here a table showing the ton-
nage of the United States from 1821 till 1869,
which is as follows:

* No enumeration of vessels was made prior to 1834. . . _
t Only nine months is included in this period by reason of the fiscal year ending this year June 30 instead
of September 30, as in the preceding years.
I wish to call attention especially to our ton-
nage in 1861 and in 1869. In 1861 the Amer-
ican tonnage entered at the port of New York
was 1,595,278, and the foreign tonnage was
725,000. Now, look at the other side of the
picture. In 1869 we had entered at the port
of New York, of American tonnage, 1,057,000,
and of foreign tonnage, 2,044,000. Sir, it is
not a pleasant picture to dwell on._ These are
facta, and as such are stubborn things.
Previous to 1861 we brought to our shores
in American bottoms the immigrants who left
foreign lands for this glorious country. Their
value to us cannot be overestimated. They
are coming, thank God 1 all the time, filling up
our great cities, covering our prairies, and
making our western wilderness beautiful. Let
them come, I say, Chinamen and all. ButI
want to bring them here in American-built
ships and under the American flag. And let
