Numbers 383. Report of Colonel John T. Lofton, Sixth Georgia Infantry.

CAPTAIN: In accordance with orders just received, the following is a report of the operations of the Sixth Georgia Regiment since the division moved on April 29:

We left camp on Wednesday morning, and camped near Hamilton's Crossing that night. The next (Thursday) morning we took position near the Crossing, with General Colquitt's brigade, at the breastworks where we remained until 3 o'clock Friday morning, when the regiment moved with the brigade toward Chancellorsville, opposite the slate house. At this point we remained until nearly dark, under severe shelling but without loss. The regiment then marched a mile or two up the plank road and camped for the night.

On the next (Saturday) morning the regiment moved beyond Chancellorsville 3 or 4 miles, and then to the right toward the river, and then moved forward to attack the right flank of the enemy. As we advanced, the order was for the Sixth Georgia Regiment to connect with the right of General Doles' brigade, on our left, which order was implicitly obeyed.

The Sixth Georgia Regiment, however, went in advance of the right of General Colquitt's brigade, as the right had to pass through a very thick undergrowth and marsh. The brigade halting, the Sixth Georgia Regiment, by order of General Colquitt, fell back to connect with it,
