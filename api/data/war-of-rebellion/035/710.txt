HEADQUARTERS WHARTON'S CAVALRY, Unionville, March 19, 1863-8.30 p. m.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,Commanding at Shelbyville:

GENERAL: Yours of 1.30 p. m. of this date has just been received. My scout has just returned. They went within 1 mile of Salem. They learned that the enemy moved out infantry (the number not known) to Salem last night. The officer could learn nothing of the evacuation, save that he was told that they were moving their wounded from Murfreesborough, and that the negroes are running to the Yankees, both of which might indicate a retrograde movement. The enemy are at the same position on this pike. I sent 250 picked men yesterday to attack the enemy near College Grove, and ordered Roddey to support them. They engaged the enemy 1 1/2 miles south of College Grove, drove them before them, and burned the bridge which they have just built over the Harpeth, near College Grove. Please advise General Bragg that I have destroyed this bridge. I learn that the enemy sent thirteen transports, laden with troops, to Carthage last Thursday. It may be General Rosecrans is about to adopt my campaign, via Carthage to Kingston, E. Tenn.

I have sent a lieutenant, with three good men, with Mr. House as a guide, to the enemy's rear, passing around to the Wilkinson pike. I will hear from them by 12 m. to-morrow. I have four men now near Triune; will report when they return. The fight at College Grove and its results are very creditable. I have a scout now at Lebanon. I will use every exertion to advise you of the movements of the enemy, and will attack them upon every opportunity. Please give me your suggestions from time to time.

I send you Cincinnati Enquirer of the 9th and 14th instant. One contains the recent elections in New York; the other a speech from Honorable Mr. [George H.] Pendleton, of Ohio.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNO. A. WHARTON,

Brigadier-General.

[P. S.]-Please return the Cincinnati Enquirer of the 14th, as it does not belong to me.
