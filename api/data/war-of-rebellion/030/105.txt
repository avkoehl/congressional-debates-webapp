Major General GEORGE, H. THOMAS, Gallatin:

A citizen, who is deep in secesh secrets, tells me he has strong reasons to believe that Kirby Smith is going into Kentucky by some inland route, east of us. Set everything in motion to find out if there is any sign of it. Order the Hartsville command to have scouts out, hired or otherwise, for 30 or 40 miles out.

J. D. HALE, Bradfordsville:

(Care of commanding officer, Lebanon.)

Captain Finley's report is wholly at variance with all our reports.

Sift the matter and men, and let me know at once. The matter is of much importance.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

[From] a secret source, entitled to much credit, [I learn] that Kirby Smith proposes to re-enter Kentucky by some route far east of us, probably by Burkesville. It may be only a project, it may be a plan, but it must be watched, and we must be ready.

W. S. ROSECRANS,Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1862.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS, Gallatin:

The general has not sufficient information yet to warrant him in ordering your movement on Lebanon; hopes to get it to-night. Meantime be prepared to move your whole force, with five days' rations, at a moment's notice. When the depot at Mitchellsville shall be cleared out, one regiment there will suffice. Granger will not be ordered down from Bowling Green so long as Kirby Smith is said to be meditating a raid upon the railroad. Hall, with four regiments from Munfordville, was ordered this afternoon to Glasgow, to scour the country well in that direction.

By command of General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
