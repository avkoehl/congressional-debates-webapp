Chase is at Wilmington consulting with the North Carolina politicians. New justice of the Supreme Bench. I received your dispatch this morning and am much obliged to you for it. I will do the best I can and trust the rest of Providence.

Yours, truly,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA, ARMY OF THE OHIO,Raleigh, May 6, 1865.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

I have received your dispatch to arrest Extra Billy Smith, which I

reckon can easily be done if he is still in this State. I would like to be informed whast class of person, or if practicable, what individuals, the Government desire to have arrested in this State. Vance and other State officers are at their homes in the country. I have though it wiser to treat them with contempt than to make lions of them for the present, but I simply wish to do what the Government desires done in the matter.

J. M. SCHOFIELD.

Major-General.

RALEIGH, N. C., May 6, 1865.

General J. E. JOHNSTON.

Charlotte, N. C.:

It has just occurred to me that some expense may have been incurred in transmitting dispatches from General Sherman to the several officers under his command through your lines. If so, please have the bill sent her with your approval, and my quartermaster will pay it.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,
