APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 1838.
S5th Cong*-"*2nd Sbss,
Independent Treasury—Mr. Clay of KyL
merce? Why should the Government play the dog mike man
ge? n Uher using its i lie hoar Is itseli uui permitting any bo
dy f ls« to use then^ Eifbits have be n made to render the
piacticeo'Misfoimtmguoon the public deposites odious, be re
pie&entms it as a thng for the benefit oí the banks alone But
is it bof Does not every clasps of the community experience
the benefit, and none moip so than the great agricultural clacS,
the price of whose products depends mainly on the facilities of
sound credit, and the abundance of active capital difluid
among the merchants—the moie immediate customers of the
banks'?
It has been sometimes said, al«o, that the practice of discount
mg on the public deposites adds to the fluctuations of the cur
rency But theieverse is demonstrably true When a large
amount of revenue is collected by the Government, and is nei
ther disbmsed in the public service nor returned to the com
munity through the medium of discounts, a sudden and dis
tressmg contiaction of the currency necessarily ensues If,
howevei, that portion of the public money not requned for the
public service, is permitted to be used m the way of discounts
ioi "hoit periods, by the banks * the circulation, through the
double process of Government di bursements and bank is&ues,
is maintained at a uniform level, without sensible contiaction
or expansion The banks being enabled to foiesee at what
periods the fun la issued by them wi 1 be requned for occasions
of public expenditure, call them in as they are wanted for dis
butsement—what is drawn in by the hand of the banks íbimme
liately let out by the hand of the Government—and thus the
curient of circulation is kepi, steady and full
These truths have, until lately, been universally felt and ac
knowledged, and by none more emphatically or with greater
weight of authonty, thin the distinguished individual in who e
footsteps' the pre&ent Administration was expected to tread
It js, doubtle^, recollected by the Senate that, on the o^eas ou
of the jemoval of the deposites trom the Bank of the United
States, Presi'ent lackson, 11 the able and memoi able papei
which he presented to his c^bmet, stated that the funds thus te
moved were rot to be ' annihilated'—that they ' would be
again issued for the benefit of the trade ' by the it bUtut ons to
which they were transferred This wis, then considered a
trait of liberal, beneficent, and state manl ke policy, on which
theCmefMagibtriteand his act weie tium phantly sustained
and vmheated by his fuends befoie tht f eople The same
distinguished individual in his very last Me age ti Corgi es«

SPEECH OF MR, CLAY,
Of Kentucky,
In Senate, February 19   1838—On the Sub Treasury bill
Ml GL VY rose and addressed the Senate as follows
I have seen some public service,  passed  through  many
troubled times, and often addressed public assemblies, m ihu  ¡
Capitol and elsewhere, but never belore have I usen in a deli
berative body, under more oppressed feelings, or with a deeper J
sense of awful lesponsibility    Never before have I usen to ex   |
press my opinions upon any public measure, fraught with. &uch
tremendous consequences to the weKare and prosperity of the
country, and so perilous to the liberties of the people, as I so
lemnly believe the bill under consideration will be      If you I
knew, sir, what sleepless hours reflection upon it has cost me   j
if you knew with what fervoi and sincerity I have implored Di
vine assistance to strengthen and sustain me in my oppo^tion
to it, I should have cied.t with you, at least, for the sincerity oi
my convictions, if I shall be so unfoituoateasnot tj have your
concurrence as to the dangerous character of the measure   And \
I have thanked my God that he has prolonged mv hfe until the
present time to enable me to exert mvself m the se-vice-of my !
country against a project fai transcef ding m peimcious tendeo

for the bright and glorious pun which shines upon us this day
It is not my purpose, at this time   Mr   President, to go at
