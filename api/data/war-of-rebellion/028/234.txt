Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

For reply to your dispatch of 10 a. m., please see my dispatch of 12 m. to the President, in reply to his of to-day. It gives at length all the information I have that has not already been sent you.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C. September 10, 1862.

(Sent 4 p. m.)

Major-General McCLELLAN, Rockville, Md.:

Three good regiments have arrived from Suffolk. Had they not better be united with some new regiments as a reserve brigade, near Tennallytown or some other point, instead of sending them immediately into the field?

H. W. HALLACK,

General-in-Chief.

BROOKVILLE, MD., September 10, 1862-8 p. m.

(Received 8.50 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

General Burnside has an advance guard at Damascus; 5,000 men at Goshen and Seneca Bridge; 4,000 at Cracklinton. Hooker's command is in the vicinity of Brookville. I cannot learn that there is any large force of the enemy's infantry this side of the Monocacy. I think there is little indication of the enemy's advancing either on Baltimore or York. I shall probably get positive information to-morrow.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

(Received September 11, 12.10 a. m.)

I have ordered a general advance to-morrow. Send me up all the troops you can spare.
