Making public officers depositories—Mr. Walker.
Senate.
Suppose, six, that one individual should say to
another that ho would make him a present of a
ceitam article, at a certain time and place, and
suppose, further, that before the time should arrive
for the delivery thereof, that article should be acci-
dentally destroyed, would that individual be under
any legal or even moral obligation to perfect that
benevolent des gh¡ No, sir, there is not a gent'e-
nian on this floor who will contend fox the fulfil-
ment of <=uch a promise, upon the gioynl that it
lays the foundation of a legal contract, -which can
be enforced by suit at liw
Again, 'ir, suppose one individual should saj to
another that he had in the hands of his. agent the
sum of fifty thousand dollars, for which he had
no present use This sum you may have, w ith all
the benefits you can derive fiom it, until he should
be under the necessity of calling foi it, when he
shoti'd return it to the owner And it is furthci
agieed, that the same shall be dehveied over in
íov i equal instalment-., in one, tw o, three and four
months Now suppose, sir, three of the above in-
stalments to have been delivered over agreeably to
the above mentioned piomise, but before the time
arrives for delivering the fourth instalment, the
gentleman who made the proposition is visited by
.some unexpected calamity, his property engulfed
m the ocean, or fire may have eonsimcd to ashes
his dwellings, oy which calamity he is wholly una
ble to complete his original design
Is here such a contract as could be legally cn-
foiced in a couit of justice' Would there be even
the slightest moial obligation resting upon that in-
dividual, after having been providentially depnved
of the means of fulfilling his design, to hand over
the fouilh ins alment as above mentioned' No, sir,
evevj gentleman must be compe'led, it he intends
to ab de the truth, to answer this question in the ro-
gativo The person to whom such an overture
was made, vouM no have the hardihood to assert
•my «uch claim He could not look his friend
in the face, and tell him that he was guilty of a
breach of faith No, he would blush to make a
charge of that sort
Mr Chairman, m the case, as abovp supposed, I
haie given you, as I think, a very fair exposition
of the deposite law of June, 1836 That law was
to regulate the deposites of the suiplus revenue of
the Geneial Government Three mstalmen s of
that surplus have b"en deluded o\ei to tre seve-
lal Starts, agreeably to the reqmstt on= of that act
but before the tune had amved for transmi ting to
the States the iouth instalment, sue find her tman
cia! affans m su-h a situation a to leave her
without any surplus to deposite How can theie
be any legal or moni obligation on the part of the
United States to deposit  a surplus levemie which
she does not possess1 It is folly as well as madness
to make any such pretensions
I will now bring to the consideration of the
House whit I consider to be a test quest on upon
this subject Let it be admitted that on the first
j day of January last, the Secretaiy of the Tieasury,
in pursuance to the requisitions of the 'oposite act,
ascertained that there was then a surplus revenue
of thirty millions to be deposited with the States
Now, suppose thit on the day following, the whole
of that sum had been annihilated? What then?
Why, forsooth, accoiding to the arguments of
learned gent'emen upon this floor, die United
States are not on'y legally, but morally, bound to
incur a debt to that amount, for the purpose of ful-
filling her contract with the several States, that is,
tie United Sta'es must create ? d°bt, m order to
creates surplis to oposite with th" State Ib s
would be an absuid ¡3 , for the cieltion of a debt
shows the want of a surplus
I entieat gentlemen not to compel the United
States to boirow money to deposite I implore
them not to tax the people for am sucn un-
holy pm no^e Is there an mdrv ldual in the com-
munity vhj would le gu ltv of >udi gross folly as
to borrow monei of one bc-iik fir the sake of de-
positing it m another? No, su, no one save a
msdman can be found The same couise bv
Which a piudent m lividual would 1 c gov Lined m
managing his financial concerns, should govern
Congress m the piesent question I again repeat,
therefore, for the United States to borrow money
to meet the fourth instalment tinder the deposite
act of June, 1836, would not only be an act of
gross injustice to the people, but an act of the
grossest folly
SPEECH OF MR. WALKER,
Ot Mississippi,
In Senate,  September 37, 183T—On the bill for the
collection, safe keeping, and disbursement of the
public monejs
Mr WALKER said   lb  Senatoi from Kentucky
(Mr   Day)  ha^ just  explained *to the Senate the
causes which, in his judgment, had pioduccl the
existing embarrassments    Among the^e causes, he
enumerated the effoit made last jearm this body
to íeduce the tariff    Thispjsition appears to me
most extraordinary     The manufacturing, as well
as every other interest in the United States, had
been greaily stimulated bj the vvondeiful expansion
of   the   bank papel system,  and it it had been
checked, as the Senator liom Kentucky supposed,
bj tlvuettorg to reduce the tariff, the overaction of
the  manufacturing interest had been so 'ar dim -
mshed, and the revulsion wmchfollowed must have
proved less disastrous in us 1 esults    If, ndeed, tie
artificial stimulus of on augmented tariff had been
supeiaddtd to the expanding influence oe the bank-
ingsvstem, tne manufac'iirmg interest would only
have been hrted for the time to a greater height of
seeming piospentv, to 1 ave received, from the re-
vulsive shock which fo lOived   a fall moie fatd in
all its consequences     If, then, the manufaauiing
interest, as is cleany shown,  received no injury

the  tai ff was unsuceesstul     But if it had  sue
ceded, I can not peiceivehovv a reduction ot the
taxes of the people couldhave increased or brought
on the pi sent disasters    On the contiaij , I shall
endeavor to piove heieafter, in the course oí this
addi ess, that the lcduction  of the  revenue to the
wants of the Government would ha%c gieatl   alle-
viated,  it not altogether  pievented,  the   casting
embarrassments      T"e  money v ould   hue   ±e-
mamed m the pockets  of th   pcopie, pud would
not lave   ¿one  1 ito    V  depo«ife banks,   ohavo
augmented to ir  iunds, and ma eased    hat 11 un
dation of paper moncv    in the leilax   f which vie
row find wlocked and ¡.handed all the gieat inte-
rest? of the country
But the  Senator from  Kentucky, ..a the great
and distinguished  champion  of the tauff policy,
might u ell oppose the measure now under conside-
ration    That measure was to continue now and
lor ever, the existing sepatation between the banl s
and the Gt i<>ial Government     T1 3 fatal union oí
bank and S a!e, it seemed to hive been overlooked
was clearly calculated to picduce a po\ tiful alli-
ance b tvveen the bank ng an1 fuifl po' c     So
lepg as th  banks are coat nucl as depos tones of
the revemtf s of this Government, it is their inte-
rest to increase those reveiu "s, and tnus augment
trien depositas and div iduids     Bj   incieasing the
tariff, the banks then inciease  om  revenues, and
augment their deposites and profits    Hence it is,
that with so few except onsni >h s both, the futnds
of tne tariff aie found united in. the effort to íestore
the former connectio 1 ce w een the Government and
the banks as the depos to ics of the pub'ic revenue
Tne it-alliance   betv een  the tatií a u banking
po toy   woukl   Le  moot   formidable  indeed    aid
shou'd be   lesisted at everj step of  its progress
by the j, eai  agucultuial   interest of   the   coun-

ponents of liee trade most be fous"' ovei aguu
m   1842,   -nhen   the    t mí   1 earned   tne   lowest
point ,n the scaX of descending fcr"ai ctioa   I look
forwa d to that pe icd as the nost ci  ical  n tl e
futme histcrj of the ecuntrv      L wci'lci then,  pe-
haps-, be flialh' dec ded, whether the tauff should
be peimitted to lemam ai the íeverue standaul, 01
vvhelhei it should be augmented and enlarged, to
advance one favored interest b}  spoliations com-
muted upon another—by the collection of taxesbe-
jond the ivants of the Government In looking
fox ward to this period, and the final adjustmeat of
tins great question at that tune, I can vote fc* no
measure which would make it the interest of the
banks to augment our tariff and levenucs, with a
view to the increase of then deposites arid divi-
dends The banking interest of the country was
already great and powerful It consisted now of eight
hundred and twenty-three banks, and w hat might be
the number m 1842, if again stimulated by heavy
deposites, no human foresight could predict or de-
termine, but if, m the next five 3 ears, it augmented
m the s< me geome rical ratio as the last, we should
have m 3842 narlj sixteen hundred banks, with a
capital epproacbw g en  thousand millions of dol-
lars Especially—judging of the future by the
p._3f—would this increase m the number of banks
be greatly promoted by reui itmg them with the
Government as depositories of the revenue And
shall I, a Scnatcr fiom a State raising now nearly
one fourth of the grtat staple of the South, and
destined soon to stand at the head of the great ex-
pc rtirg States m the Union—s¡ja¡¡ J aid, by my
vote, n bringing either now, or m 1842, this great
banking mteiest of the country m aid of, and alli-
ance with the tariff pohcvl
But if the re-alhance*between the banks and ths
Got eminent vv ould consummate the union between
ihe banking and tariff interests, the discontinuance
of the banlf as depositories of the revenue,
under the provisions of this bill and its amend-
ments, will make it the interest of the banks to
oppose tne augmentation of the revenue By this
bill, the bajks aie at once and for ever discon-
tnued as depositor es of the revenue, and by
gi dual and successive steps, commencing now,
arc "<mg iul'v into opeiat on in 1?42, no bank
p pei Vr tl at p< r od w 1I1 be receivtd in payment
of the ¡ 10 c dies an 1 cons-querll}, alier that
date, these payments must be made chiefly m
gold and si 1 ver INow, the gr<;at argument of the
fnends of the bank deposite system is, that fihis
bill will dimmish the specie in the vaults of the
banks, by substituting that specie foi bank notes
in revenue pavn rnts So far as this effect may
ultimate)} be preluced paitially by this bill, it
will 11 ke if the 11'' icst of the banks to dimmish
the tantl and the nvcnue, so as to dimmish the
calls upon them for the ledemption of their notes
111 specie, to be uced 11 revenue pavmtnls The
alii r tne leunt of the revenue, the less will
be the 1 ilu< n-c of th s b il m dimir slung the c r-
cuKtion and profits of the bank  Thus, it undei
this sys*em tht Government co'lected little or no
levenue, the oil! under consideration would have
Utile or no effict upon the cuculation of the banks,
whereas, under such a tariff as that of 1828, the
revenue from duties would amount now to nearly
fifty millions of dollars and produce a wonderful
cu tailment f the cuculation nd profits of the
banks Ths baiAs then, now as web as m 1842,
un V=r V sysem we propose, would be duectly
mtcested in diminishing the lev enue and keeping
dow 11 fir ta iff
~\cr is it l"ss obvious that, upon the same prin-
ciples the idept 01 of th s measure would make it
the 11 terest of the banks tj dmtnish th'revenue
