(Sent 10.36 a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT, Commanding, &amp;c.:

The new iron-clad Tunxis left Philadelphia of Washington the 11th instant. She is said to draw only seven feet of water. She is the very boat we want here in case we get hold of the Howlett house battery, as she can go up at once through the channel and hold what we get, and also can move up and down without danger of getting on shore, and save wooden boats the danger of picket duty, and protect transports from shore batteries. If you agree with me, might not the Tunxis be applied for?
