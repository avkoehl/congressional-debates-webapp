HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 15, 1864-7 a.m.

General WILLIAMS:

Nothing of importance occurred on my line last night. The battery at the burnt house is finished, with exception of cutting the embrasure and making the magazine. The mine is progressing favorably. I shall receive a report from there at 12 o'clock, which I will forward. There was some little musketry and considerable cannonading from the enemy, apparently attracted by the signal lights at these headquarters, which were placed too high. They will be changed to-night.

Major DUANE,Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac:

I would be glad if you would direct the party leveling fortifications to defer work on the line near the Dunn house for the present. We have a hospital there and the work would disturb the sick and perhaps draw fire. The hospital will be moved to-day, and your parties can in the meantime work on other parts of the line. An order sent there will be transmitted to the officer in charge.

A. E. BURNSIDE,
