Generals Hancock, Wright, and Smith have taken the advanced rifle-pits of the enemy, and are directed to continue their assaults, which they are now doing. Barlow's division got possession of the enemy's main line, but did not maintain himself there.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 3, 1864-8.45 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch of 6 a. m. is just received. The commanding general directs me to say that you must not wait for simultaneous attacks, but push forward your assaults.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, Bethesda Church, June 3, 1864-9 a. m.

General MEADE:

We have forced the enemy back still farther on the road to Shady Grove, but I have all my troops in one line. I cannot maintain the battle this way all day without re-enforcements. Can I withdraw them, if necessary, from my own left without jeopardizing the force of the enemy except by the extent of his front, which is very great, and by the prisoners we have taken, which are from all three of Lee's old corps. They probably have not all the force this last would indicate. The right of my corps is now over on the Shady Grove road, and General Burnside is preparing to move down the road toward Mechanicsville, toward the position he left yesterday.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-9.30 a. m.

General MEADE:

I have written you every little while, and sent to you to substance of General Burnside's and my operations. We have been fighting hard on our right, and are getting the enemy back, which will eventually shorten our lines and make more troops available for assault. While we attacked form our right, the enemy assaulted my right center, but were repulsed. I am not waiting for anybody, but putting in whenever I can judiciously.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
