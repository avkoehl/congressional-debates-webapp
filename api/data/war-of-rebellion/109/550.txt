Knoxville, Tenn., April 27, 1864.

Major-General STONEMAN,Commanding Cavalry Corps, Nicholasville, Ky.:

GENERAL: I send you an extract from an order* of General sherman, which indicates your field of operations. As I telegraphed you yesterday,+ the general directs me to order your command forward at once to join me at Charleston or in advance of that place. At the best you will reach me too late to carry out the full programme, but, of course you cannot be expected to do impossibilities. Let your cavalry come forward by regiments as rapidly as they can be provided with the necessary transportation. A small force at the right time may be more valuable than a large one later. I would like to have you come forward with your advance if you can do so without risking too much delay in getting forward the portion that is to follow. Please keep me advised of your progress. I go to Charleston on the 30th.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
