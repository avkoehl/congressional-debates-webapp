Gregg's division taking the Cedar Mountain road, leaving a force to hold Culpeper. I moved with the command toward Raccoon Ford, and drove the enemy handsomely from Pony Mountain, where our signal has been located, and then followed them to within 2 1/2 miles of Raccoon Ford. Shall stop for the night.

General Gregg reports he has had an obstinate fight, but was driving the enemy on the Cedar Mountain road slowly. Our loss as far as ascertained is 3 killed and about 40 wounded. General Custer was wounded in the charge capturing the guns that were taken, and his horse was killed under him. His gallantry was distinguished.

All the indications thus far go to show that the enemy's army has retired. I shall endeavor to-morrow to give you definite information. Unless the cloudy weather interferes shall be able to communicate by signal from Pony Mountain.

We captured quite a large amount of ammunition at Culpeper, which the enemy were endeavoring to take off by a train of cars.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have position on the Rapidan at Somersville and Raccoon Fords, the enemy occupying the opposite side. We have not been able to effect a crossing in consequence of the advantages the opposite side gives in commanding the fords. At Somerville Ford, General Kilpatrick reports the enemy having about 2,000 infantry, and infantry has also been seen opposite Raccoon Ford. Two negroes report that an infantry column came down this morning and occupied the rifle-pits on the other side.

If a corps was placed at Raccoon Ford and another at Mitchell's Station, with a third at supporting distance at Culpeper, I could cross the river below, and then move in rear and uncover these fords. I believe the largest part of Lee's army has gone South.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
