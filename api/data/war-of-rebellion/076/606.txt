HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Before Atlanta, Ga., August 19, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. R. TOWNES,Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

I have the honor to report that at 12 m. to-day orders were received to make a demonstration along the line of the division, which was at once obeyed by sending forward two regiments displaying troops, firing with artillery and infantry. The enemy at once replied all along the line with some infantry, and from three position in my immediately front with the artillery, probably not more than a section, at each place. This was in addition to firing with artillery from the two positions fired from last evening. Excepting a brisk and ineffective fire for about ten minutes along the picket-line last night nothing else of importance has transpired in the front of this line for the last twenty-four hours.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

In visiting the lines yesterday I observed that opposite the left of General Leggrett the rebels, as skirmishers, occupy a continuous line of rifle-pits. If your engineer can put up a work for a couple of guns, temporarily, I think you can drive them out. Please investigate the matter and report to me the result.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
