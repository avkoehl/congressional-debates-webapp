to purchase intoxicants. As some of them have exhibited much mechanical talent, I think it advisable to teach them the carpenter's and blacksmith's trades. Inclosed are communications from Captain Bristol, Fifth U. S. Infantry, and Rynerson, assistant quartermaster, and William P. Colloway, late captain, U. S. Volunteers, and now superintendent of the Indian farm, giving their views on this subject, and marked, respectively, A, B, and C. * One of the great steps toward removing the curse to New Mexico, which has so long blighted her prospects and retarded her advancement, is now accomplished in having forced these savages to quit their wild life and mountainous homes, to cease their murdering and their thieving depredations upon her people, and go upon a reservation, there to live at peace with the white population. Whether the Bosque Redondo is the best selection that could be made for this purpose I am unable to say. I think it a good one. That the reservation should be far removed from the former haunts of these Indians to accomplish the object for which it is designed, is my opinion. Thus far it seems to be working successfully. That any one who has at heart the best interests and prosperity of New Mexico should consent to, much less urge, the return of these savages to their former country to renew their hostilities upon our people, appears most unreasonable. That the people of this country will so stultify themselves by advocating such a course I cannot believe.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
