The garrison at Fort Johnson will be employed in the construction of traverses and bomb-proofs needed at the batteries in that vicinity, and also of covered ways connecting them; the work, however, to be done under the general directions of the engineer department.

Finally, the commanding general directs that special attention shall be given to the condition of all barges, boats, and crews collected for the purpose of removing the troops from Morris Island, should the contingency arise, and he wishes a suitable officer to be specially charged with the duty of keeping the water transportation in a proper state of efficiency.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District:

GENERAL: The commanding general instructs me to direct the reduction of the garrison of Fort Sumter to a force of one company of artillery and two full companies of infantry; that is, the command not to exceed 300 or fall 200 men.

Of course you will select the companies, which must be of the best in your command, of both arms; but it has been suggested that Captain Harleston's company, of the First Regiment of Artillery, would be suitable. The infantry should be carefully selected, and might be relieved once a week.

As the garrison will thus be so much reduced, it may be that Colonel Rhett will prefer to remove the headquarters of his regiment, in which event he will be assigned to the important command of Fort Johnson and adjacent batteries. He has the option to do this, or retain the command of Fort Sumter. In the former event, Major Stephen Elliott, jr., will be assigned to the command of Fort Sumter.

The commanding general has witnessed, with genuine pride and gratification, the defense made of Fort Sumter, by Colonel Rhett, his officers, and the men of the First Regiment of South Carolina Regular Artillery, noble fruits of the discipline, the application to their duty, and the soldierly bearing of the officers and men, and of the organization of the regiment.

In the annals of war no stouter defense was ever made, and no work ever before encountered as formidable a bombardment as that under which Fort Sumter has been successfully held.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
