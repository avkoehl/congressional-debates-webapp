Colonel ABBOT:

The attempt is to be made. General Terry is now at General Wright's headquarters arranging details.

A. TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JUNE 17, 1864-8 p.m.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL,

Chief Engineer Department, &amp;c:

I have arranged for the details and instructed the engineers, as per your order received from Lieutenant Michie half an hour ago. The enemy now hold the point in force. To succeed it will be necessary to drive them back very promptly-in fact, fight a battle at once-or there will not be time to complete the works. We have no wire, and abatis will be hard to procure at that spot.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Chief Engineer of Defenses.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 17, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

General Terry will notify you when it is safe to commence.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

JUNE 17, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

I would respectfully suggest that the work in front of No. 4 should be large enough to accommodate at least 1,000 men. The ground in front of its salient cannot be swept by the artillery fire of the works, as it is a ravine, not seen. Its flanks are exposed to a reverse musketry fire from the trees, which would also prevent approach of succor, and it is exposed to a close cross-fire of canister from batteries hid by the woods from the main line.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Chief Engineer of Defenses.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 17, 1864-11.05 p.m.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT:

General Grant's orders for to-night are to retake and hold the enemy's line of works; the new work is to be [built], and when it is done, of it is done, there will be an ample opportunity to counteract all the objections you make.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
