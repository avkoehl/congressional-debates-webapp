[General GRANT:]

DEAR GENERAL: My boat arrived here an hour ago, and the pilots are gone to sound the bar. River very low, and we will surely have to land our men and stock, and pass round the bar, and even then it is doubtful if this boat can pass. River is lower than ever known before. I have sent one of my staff up to General Buford to learn the news. I have papers of the 25th.

Rosecrans is at Chattanooga awaiting re-enforcements. Bragg threatens him close at hand. The newspapers announce that Rosecrans is already re-enforced by Burnside and Sherman. They will doubtless hold us accountable for not passing by magic from Black River to Chattanooga. It will be as much as I expect to get to Memphis to-morrow, and all the Second Division is behind me. We found plenty of wood at Griffin's Landing, 10 miles below Greenville, and plenty here. The wood at Griffin's is about a mile back, and is represented by one of my staff at 4,000 cords. It would well pay to send up and haul it to the bank. To move troops along the river, wood-yards must be established. It would be better for the Fourth Division to come on without waiting for the return of these boats, and work their way up on small boats as best they can. I will send your letters up to Cairo by a staff officer.

Minnie is much better, but Willie, my oldest boy, is very sick.

I will push matters from Memphis with all possible energy, but no amount of energy will move a sand-bar.

Yours, in haste,W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
