cause that was what nothing that sprang from man had ever
been Butnow, after the iapseofhalf a cpntury, it was interest-
ing to pause—to look back—10 review the history of that pe
nod, and to compare the piedictionsof those who then looked
into the future with the actual re&ults of subsequent expedience
Any one atalí acquainted with the contemporaneous histoiy of
the Constitution, must know that one gitat and radical error
which possessed the minds of the wise men who drew up that
instrument was an apprehension that the Executive department
of the theruproposed Government would be too feeble to contend
successfully m a struggle with the power of the legislature
hence it was found that van u& expedients had been proposed
in the Convention, with the avowed purpose ofstrengthenmg the
Executive arm, one of which went solar astopiopo&e that the
Presilent should be Chief Magistrate for life All the&e propo
sals had their origin, m the one prevai'ing idea—that of the
weakness of the Executive, and its incompetence to defend it
splf against the encroachments of legislative domination and
dictation
Now, let any man look at the a-tual working of the machine
they constructed  and see whether the anticípala ns which
haunted their mmdouihissubjcu hdd been real zed 01 falsified
hy the subsequent political histoiy of this Government 1 et
him see whether the Executive Department was the weak spot
lu the system Much had been said about the encroachments
of the Federal Government on the Governments of the ¡states,
from which complaints had ausen what was called the States
rights party and its opposite, but an examination of the facts
of the case would demonstrate that no solitary instance had yet
occurred of any ¡such encroachment by the General Govern
meat, but, on tne contrary, Mr C could demonstrate were
this the pioper time or occasion for doing so, that ihdMhad
been an abandonment by that Government ofthe esetcrw^f its
own just powers m relation to the Sfate< and this to such an
extent that the existing state of the country pie*ented veiy
much the same aspect as the old Confederation had once done,
with all its weakness and imbecility
But while there had been no such thing m practice as an
eneioachment by the feleral upon the ¡stateGovernments,
there had, within the FeUral Grvernment itself, boí>n i ecu
etant eneioachment by the Executive upon the Legislative lie

these encroachments by the Executive upon the constitutional
powers and prerogatives of a single legislative branch of the
Government He would now pac,6 to its attacks on the powers
ofthe Congiess ofthe United States
And the first instance of this to which he should refer was
<he creation of officers and the designation oi their salaries,
without the consent of Congress or any consultation wnhit
Another and a more foimidable instance was to be found m
the assumption within the last few years of the purse of the
nation lie alluded, as every body must understand, to the
seizure by a late Fxecutive ofthe public deposites placed by
law in the Bank of the United States—a removal which had
been effected under the avowed claim of power to employ the
prerogative of removal as a means to compel subordinate ex
ecutive officers  to comply with the will of the Pieeident, on
the principle that the Execut ve was a unit, and that a single
will must control the entire Execunve Department This
seizure ofthe public deposites had) et been unprovided against,
the Congiessional powei to control them had been unresum
ed, and thus a state of things was permuted to continue by
which the nation was vntually placed at the feet of thefcxecu
I et not gentlemen mock him by talking about the lmpossibi
hty of the Piesident's diawing money out of the Treasury ex
cept under an appropriation by Congress let them not tell him
ofthe respo sibihty of public officers, let them look at facts
let them look at what had actually occurred on the removal of
two orthreebecretariesof the Tieasury, m order to accom
pltsh this very seisure ofthe public treasure, and then lathem
look at the dismissal of a countless host of subordinate officers
because they did not happen to hold the same political opinions
that were held by the Piesiáent Of what avail weie laws'1
The President had nothing to do but say to his Secretai y, issue
your wairant for such a sum of money and direct the Register
and Comptrollertosign it, and if they shouldtaik afeouta re
gard foi their oath* and boggle at obejing-, tell them to do
what I command them and if not, I will find men who will

prove in prat tice utterly vain and ineffectual There was a
thiidmstancp of this etfu arhment winch he was authonzed
by fact-s to state, but on which he should not at this time dwell
Not only had the pui «e of the nation been sei/ed not only did

there no veto against tl « hi^'ies {"p^cription of a I legislation
t ie fmdamental legislation by a corvention? There was no
veto there—there was no apprehension of hasty action—no ne
ressity was lecogmsed for the eontiolhne will of one nan to
save tl'e nation from the heedless acts of its own lepresenta
uves    But tn the case of ordinary legislation why should such
■f
US
apprehensions be indulged? On this subject experience waa
our safest guide Now, Mr C haá taken the pains to look
into the pi ovisions of twenty six State constitutions in relation
to this matter ofthe veto, and the result was highly curious and
interesting. The Stales were m this respect divided, asequally
as their numbers would admit, into three distinct classes, fiiae
of them gave to the Executive the veto power unless controlled
by two thu ds of ihe Legislature Eight other Stales conferred
the veto, but controlled it by a second vote of a majority, as
was proposed in the amendment now under consideration
While the nine remaining States had not inserted the veto at all,
and at the head ofihese stood one which had been called the
mother of States—Virginia Now, someof these State consti-
tutions were oi a date anterior to that of the Constitution ofthe
United States itself If there had been this very great danger
ofExecutive encroachment and of hasty legislation, one would
suppose it would have been heard of m these nine States Had
any instance yet occurred to show that such a danger did ex
let? Mr C had heard of none—iead of none—and he put it to
the advocates ofthisaibttrary and monarchical power, he put
ue^pecially to Democrats who, while they professed them
selves, and he doubted not honestly and conscientiously pro
fessed themselves friends of the people, came out m the contest
between monarchical preiogative on the one hand and civil
freedom on the other, as the avowed advocates of prerogative—
he put it to all of them to tell, if such dangers both ofencroach-
mentand rashness as were pretended as a pretextfor the veto
did actually exiht, how it happened that in tbe nine States he
had namad, during so long a period as had elapsed emce Iheir
constitutions were formed, no instances had occurred either of
encroachment by the Legislature on the powers ofthe Execu*
tive, or of such rash and hasty legislation as called for the re
stramt and safeguard of a single soveieign will?
Now, before he proceeded further, he invited gentlemen to
formajust estimate of this veto power, to look at it, to see
what u was to ascertain what was its value, what it amounted
to in the practical operations of Government He should not
pietend to go mio any inquiry as to us moial value, or to eeti
mate itsmfluenceon the individual whoexercised it, or the de
gree and extent to which by means of it, in connection with a
vast patronage, tbe Pi tsiduit could sway the minds of other
men, foi that was a power which admitted of no estimate He
should confine himself to wheu might be called amere numen
cal ebtim-íte ofthe amount of the veto power, and he would
make thu, e^um tie by taking the numbeis of the two Houses of
Gongr^s as those Houses now stood The Senate at piesent
consisted offifty two members, of that number a majoritj con
oisted of tv enty seven, two thirds amounted to thirty six
Supposing a law io be pa sed by a bare majo Hy, (and 111 all
great and conte ted qu stions bills were wont to be parsed by
very small majorities,) then theie would be in its favor twenty
seven vo<s foe bill was submitted to the Piesident and ie
tinned by him wiih his vein The force of the Presidential
veto could not be overturned but by thirty six volts Here,
then, the veto m the hand1  ot the Presiaent was equal in its ef
feet upon legislation to nine fcenatonal votes Mr C demise
ed all consideiafnns of influence derived fiom his office, all the
glmer and eclat of the Piesident's high station, and ail the pei
fcuaüiou directed to the inteiests of men by his vast patronage,
all this he laid out nfview and looked merely at the numerical
fact that in the Senate the veto was equal to nine votes And
now in icg-nd to th** 0 her branch The House oí Represen
tativci c< n is e 1 of 242 trembet^, to consti ute a majority re
qui ed 122 two ihmis amounted to 162 By looking at this
diffeience, it would be se^n, as m the case of the Serate, that
tt the Executive veto amounted in effect to forty Representative
to tew
Now, Mi C did not mean to say any thing m the least de
íogatory to the wisdom, or fairness, or integrity, or patriotism,
of any President e f the United Sta'ea It was not necessary,
and he was utterly unwilling without necessity, to injure the
feci ngs of any man We had bed six Piesidents who had
previously be n Senator^ They were able and eminent
men but he wished to inquire whether any gentleman could
show that then wisdom asió other distinguished qualities
had been so gieit ¿s 10 be equal to the wisdom of nine
other Senators'! Could it be shown that theh patriotism
and 1 itelligence and integiity weie equal to those of forty
members of the House of Representatives? If not, how did
it happen thxt a man who when in that Chamber and acting
with hii fellow Senatois, bsd been considered upon a par with
them was no so mer transferred to the other end of the avenue
