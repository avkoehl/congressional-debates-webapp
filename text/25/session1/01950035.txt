the effects will be different, it would be but to eon
firm the views which I have presented
As connected with this, there is a point well de-
serving consideration The union between bank
and Government is not only a main source of that
dangerous expansion and contraction in the bank-
ing system, which I have already illustrated, but is
also one of the principal causes of that powerful
and almost irresistible tendency to the increase of
banks, which even its friends see and deplore. I
dwelt on this point on a formei occasion, (on Mr
"Webster's motion to renew the bank chartei in
1833,) and will not repeat what I then said But,
m addition to the causes then enumerated, theie
are many others very powerful, and among ¡others
the one under consideration They all may be
summed up in one general cause We have made
banking too profitable, far, very fai, too profitable
and, I may add, influential One of the most am-
ple sourees of this profit and influence may be
traced, as I have shown, to the connexion with the
Government, and is, of course, among the promi-
nent causes of ihe stiong and incessant tendency
of the system to mciease, which even its fnends
see must finally overwhelm either the banks 01
the institutions of the eountrv With a view to
check us growth, thev have proposed to limit the
number of banks and the amount of ba.ikmg capi-
tal by an amendment of tht constnution, but it is
obvious, that the effects of such an amendment, il
it were practicable, would but mciease the piolUs
and influence of bank c apilal, and that, finally, u
would justly produce such indignation ®n the pari
of the lest of the community agam=t such unequal
advantages, that in the end, aftei a long and vio-
lent struggle, the overthrow of the entue system
would follow To cbviate this difficulty, it has
been proposed to add a limitation upon the amount
of their business, the effects of -which would be
the accommodation of favontes to the exclusion of
the rest of the community, w Inch -would be no less
fatalto the system There ( an be jp fact, but one
safe and consistent íemed) , the rendeung banking,
as a business, less piofitable and influential, and
the first and decisive step towards this, is a disse-
verance between the banks and the Government
To this may be added, some effectual limitation on
the denomination of Ihe note-- to be issued, which
would operate in. a similar manner
I pass over other important objections to the con-
nexion , the corrupting influence and the spuit of
speculation which it spreads far and wide ovei the
land Who has not seen and deplored tht vast and
coiruptmg influence brought to beat upon ihe legis-
latures to obtain ehaiters, and the means necessary
to participate in theprofhs of the institutions This
gives a (ontrol to the Government, which giants
such favois, of a most extensive and pernicious
character, all of which must continue to spread
and increase, if the connexion should continue,
until the whole community must become one con-
taminated and coriupted mass
There is another, and a final reason, which I shall
assign against the reunion with the banks    We
have leached a new era with  regaid to these insli
tutions     He who would judge of the futuie by the
past, in reference to them, will be wholly mistaken
The year 1833 marks the commencement of this
era    That extraordmaiy man who had the power
of imprinting his own feelings on the community,
then commenced his hostile attacks, which have
left such effects behind, that the war then com-
menced against the banks, I clearly see, w ill not
terminate,   unless  there be a separation between
them and the Government—until one oi the othei
triumphs—till the Government becomes the bank,
or the bank  the Government    In lesistmg then
union I act  as the fi lend of both     I have, as I
have said, no unkind  feeling toward (he banks
I am neithei a bank man, nor an anti-bank man
I have had little connexion with them    Many of
my -best friends, foi whom I have the highest es
teem, have a deep interest in their prospenty, and
as far as friendship or peisonal attachment extends,
my  inclination would be strongly m their favoi
But I stand up here as the repiesentative of no par
ticulai  interest     I look to the  whole, ai d to th'
future as well as the present, and I shall steadily
pursue that course which, undci tf c mov tn'aigcd
view, I believe to be mv  duty     In  P>1 I saw the
present crisis    I m vain raised aw annua voice
and endeavored to avert it    I now see wnheunil
certainty, one fat more poilentous    If this stmggle
is to go on—if the banks will insist upon a leumon
■With  the Government, agams' the sense of a laige
and influential poition of the community—and,
abov p all, if they should succeed in effecting it, a
reflux flood will inevitably sweep away the whole
system A deep popular excitement is nevei with-
out some reason, and ought ever to be treated with
respect, and it is the pai t of w ¡sdom to look timely
into the cause, and correct it before the excite-
ment shall become so great as to demolish the ob-
ject, with all us good and evil, against which it is
dn ected
The only safe course foi both Government and
banks, is to remain as they'aie, separated—each m
the use of then o\v n credit and m the manage-
ment of their own affairs The less the contiol
and influence of the one over the othei the better
Confined to their legitimate spheie, that of afloid
mg tempoi ary ci edit to commercial and business
men, bank notes would furnish a sale and con-
venient circulation in the lange of commeice and
business, within which the banks may be respee
tivel) situated, exempt almost enurely fiom those
fluctuations and convulsions to which they are now
so exposed , oi if the) should occasionally be sub-
ject to them, the ei il would be local and tempoiai\
leaving undistmbed the action oí the Government,
and the geneial cunency of the coivnti\,on the
stability of which the prospeiitv and safety of the
community so much depend
I have now statedrav objections lo the leumon of
the Got.ernment and the banks II theyaie well
founded , if the State banks aie of themselves m-
compe em agents, if a bank of the United Slates
be impraciicable or if practicable, would, at this
time, be the destiuclion of a laige portion of the
existing banks, and of renewed and spyeie pecu
nnry distiess if it would be against the settled
conviction of an old andpowciful partv, whose op-
position tune cannot abate il the Union ot Go
veinment md binks adds to the unfitness ot then
notes for cu dilation, and be unjust and unequal be-
tween citizen and citizen and one portion of ihe
Union and inolhei , and (mall) , if it w ould excite
an implacable and oostinate wai, which could only
terminate in the oveithrow of the banking system,
oi the institutions of the country, it then lemams
that the only alteinative would be pennanently to
separate the t-w o, and to reoiganize the Treasmy
«o as to enable it to pcrfoim those duties which
have heretofore been perfoimed bvthe banks as its
fiscal agents This proposed reorganization has
been called a subtreasuij—an unfortunate word,
calculated to mislead and conjnie up difficulties
and dangeis that do not in reality exist So fat
from an expenment, or some new device, it is only
leturnmgto the eld mode of collecting and dis-
buismg publ'c m'iev, wbidi foi thousands of
years, has not tht practice of all enlightened peo[le
till within the last century
In w hat niannoi His intended to íeoigamze the
Treasury by the bill íepoited I do not Know I
have been too much engaged to react it, and I
can only saj, that for one, 1 shall assent to no ai
langemenf which piovides foi a Tieastuy bank,
oi thai can be pen piled into one If there can be
any scheme more fatal than a leunion with the
banks ai this time, it w ould be such a pioject Nor
will I give my assent to any airangemcnt which
shall add the least unnecessaiy patronage I am
the sworn foe to pationage, and have done as
much and sufTeied as much in lesisung it as any
one Too many years have passed over me to
change, at this late da}', my coui se or principles
But I will «ay, that it is impossible "o to organize
the Treasury for the perfoimanee of its own fune
tions, astogne to the Executive a tenth part of
the patronage it will lose by the pioposed sepa-
lalion, which, when the bill foi the leoiganization
comes up, I may have an oppoitunitv to show I
have venluied tins assertion after much leflection,
and with entire confidence m lis correctness
But something more mil > be done besides the re
organization d (he Treasury Under the lesolu
tion of 1816, bank notes would again be received in
the dues of the Goveii ment, if the banks should
r sume specie payments The legal as well as
the actual connexion, must be severed Bui Tarn

rency ol the United States, or bills, notes, or puper

be authorized to be íeceived m then dues. II the
time is not thought to be ample, I am perfectly dis-
posed to extend it The period is of little import-
ance m my ey es, so thai the object be effected
In addition to this, it seems to me that some mea-
sure, of aremed al tharactei, connected with the
cunency, ought to be adopted, to ease offthe pies-
suie while the proce-s i" going throngl It is de-
sirable that the Government should make as few
and small demands™ ihe spece maiket as possible
dining the time, so as to thiow no impediment m
the w av of the resumption of specie payments.
With this view, I am of the impression that the
sum necessan fo) the piesem wants of the Trea-
siuj should be íaised bv a paper, which should at
ihe same time have ihe i equisite qualities to enable
ii topeiform die Junctions of a paper ciiculation.
Undo thisiinpiession 1 object to the interest to be
allowed on the Ticasmy notes, which this bill au-
thon/es tobe issued on the \erj opposite ground
that the Señalen fiom Massachusetts bestow* his
appiobation He appioves of interest, because it
would fhiow I lieu) out ot ciiculation into the hands
of capitalists, as a convenient and safe investment,
and Idisappiove, because it will have that effect
1 am disposed to ea^e off ihe process , he, I would
suppose  is v eiv little sohcmnis on that point.
But I go lauhei I am of the impression to
make this gicat nicasuie successful and secure it
against reaction, some stable and safe medium of
cnculal on, to take the place of bank notes m ihe
fiscal op' itttions oí the Government, ought to be
issued I intend to propose nothing II would be
impossible, vs ill so gi eat a w eight of opposition, to
pes, air. niea«ii'e without the entue support of the
administration, and, if it were, it ought not to
be attempted wheie s0 much must depend on the
mode of execution The best measure that could
be devised might fail, and impose a heavy respon-
sibility on its author, unless it met w ith the hearty
appiobation of those who are to execute it I then
intend merely to throw out suggestions, in order
to excite the leflection of others on a subject so
delicate, and of so much impoitance, acting- on the
pnnciple that n is the duly of all m so great a
juncture to present then Mews without reseive.
It is, then, my impression, tha>, m the present
condition ef the world, a pipei cunency, m some
four, if not nece^ai}, is almcs  indispensable m

and extensive comn frenes ' In n>anj respects, it
has a vast superiority over a metallic currency,
especially in gieat and eUended tiansactions, by
ils ¿íeatei  cheapness, bglunt «, and the facility oí

is, to ascertain what  desoíplion of papel has the
n'miisite qualities of 1 eing free fiom fluctuation in
v alue, and liability to abuse, m the greatest perfec-
tion     I hav e shown, I tiust, that ihe bank notes do
not possess these requisites m a degree sufficiently
high for this puipose    I go lauhei    It appears to
