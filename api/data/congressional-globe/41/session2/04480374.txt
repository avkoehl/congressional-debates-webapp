Duty on Lumber—Mr. Ferry.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
and we shall rapidly be preparing for an ade-
quate supply of timber before that of our own
forests snail materially be diminished. Our
jforests do not so rapidly disappear as the gen-
tleman would have us believe. My friend from
Maine [Mr. Peters] pertinently affirmed this
view when he remarked that " thirty years ago
there was a dread in Maine that our lumber
would soon be exhausted, while there is a pro
duction now several times larger than then."
Let me suggest to the solicitous gentlemen a
remedy, for the pacification of their fears and
first, I invite them to this quotation from their
fruitful memorialist, Mr. Davis, whose author-
ity they do not question:
" It is well known to those engaged in the foreign
shipment of lumber from Boston and Now York that
the inoonvenienee of bonding lumber (with other
obstacles in the way of our general shipping trade)
has directly influenced them in making shipments
direct from Canada; honed arse shipments h:i.\-c been
made by those shippers during the last two years from
Montreal and Sorel. This hits stimulated the manu-
facturers on tho St. Lawrence in opening the South
Amerioan trade direct. From tho Bureau of Statis-
tics wo find the exportation of lumber for 1865 to be
$4,340,664 in value; in lBnl), even a.t the advanced
cost of the lumber, the exportation was only $2,817-
903 in value."
The importations of lumber from Canada last
year were, at the average value for the season,
$5,912,500. Now, in consequence of the tariff,
our South American trade in lumber has fallen
off by being directed to Canadian markets,
access to which has been invited through the
increased expense of laud transportation and
incidsntal obstacles to our Atlantic ports. This
decrease of our exportation from CGI,
in 1865, to $2,817,903 m 1869, of 551,522,701,
or nearly one third, leaves us a residue ot
$3,094,600 of lumber importations from Can-
ada over our exportations of the like article to
foreign markets.
An increase of the tariff on lumber would
shut off entirely all such exportations, and save
lo the forests of our States to the extent of
what comes into our markets from the prov-
inces. A greater source of preservation than
iliis, however, lies in the more economical use
of timber that follows higher rales and paying
prices for lumber. It is a well-known fact to
those conversant with the business of lumber-
ing that when prices rule low manufacturers
are driven to out and purchase the better quali-
ties of logs, in order to save themselves from
impending losses. The larger and choicer selec-
tions of trees are felled and the body cut into
logs, while the portions nearer the top and into
the limbs are left to rot upon the ground. More
than this, the smaller-sized trees, such as would
be cut when prices were remunerative, are left
standing to be more or less destroyed by fire,
which finds in abandoned portions of tree and
top ample fuel to arrest the growth and render
worthless what is thus left standing because of
not sufficient size and value to pay the expense
ot conversion into lumber. The magnitude of
this loss will be more fully appreciated by con-
sidering the proportion of timber thus aban-
doned to destruction, to the amount annually
converted for market. The lowest estimate of
competentjudges places this waste in the woods
atonequarter of the originally standing timber,
and many place it at one third.
The average annual increase of lumber sold
in the Chicago market for the ten years from
1859 to 1869 has been 70,000,000 feet, the sales
of 1859 being substantially 300,000,000, and of
18G9, 1,000,000,000 feet. One quarter, there-
fore, of the supply of1869 left to destruction in the
woods would be 250,000,000 feet, 180,000,000
more than the average annual increase of sup-
ply in this single market for the past decade of
years.
When lumber brings in market a fair profit
the timber is worked up so much closer that
tho proportion left as valueless for purposes of
manufacture is nearer one eighth of standing
quantity. This would leave but 125,000,000
feet as a dead loss upon those cuttings of the
last season, being a net saving to the waning
forest of 125,000,000 feet annually upon a yearly
production equal to that of 1869. This esti-
mate of one market will serve as a basis to
reveal the amount of what timber would be
saved upon the total cuttings of the States. It
is to these two methods of fostering and per-
petuating the supply of our forests that I invite
cooperation, and upon it challenge public judg-
ment with the gentlemen, in contradistinction
to the destructive and robbing process to which
shorter sighted advocates seem wedded.
In 1 lie policy these theorists propose they
would exhaust the margin left to the manu-
facturer, and compel him to losses and final
abandonment of a chosen occupation, miles-,
in self-defense he turned his unwilling steps
upon his operatives, who thrive when he thrives
and must suffer when he suffers. With a
capital invested m the three lumbering States
of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, of
$100,000,000 in the erection and operation of
seven hundred mills, for which, in the way of
iron and steel of various kinds, copper, brass,
nails, axes, glass, files, belting, hemp, and saws,
of which St. Louis, Missouri—and I hope to
catch the ear of the gentleman [Mr. AsperJ
from that State—supplies nearly $100,000
annually, the magnanimous lumbermen cheer-
fully pay the enhanced prices incident to the
tariff imposed for their adequate protection,
they must in tarn reflect with amazement upon
statesmen who, under the plea of cheapening
commodities to their self-protecting constit-
uents, would so ungenerously drive them from
industrial prosperity. it is withholding from
them what is arrogated by others.
If gentlemen press this demand to success
all disguise shall be torn asunder, and in then'
logical and real character of striking at Amer-
ican labor shall they be put before the coun-
try. Over five sixths of the cost of the manu-
facture oflumber, from the stump to the mart,
is for labor. Lumber selling now at actual
cost, and even lower, must in the estimation of
these gentlemen be made still "cheaper," and
the mode was suggestively adverted to by the
gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Cook,] when he
said, "Nor do our manufacturers of lumber
compete with tho pauper labor of Europe." Is
it the purpose, then, to compel manufacturers
of lumber to draw from the sinews of then-
laborers that which is denied by the wealthy
Illinois farmers ? If so, to this mournful exhibit
which I hold would they force our laborers to,
and to which I beg the thoughtful scrutiny of
any advocate of "cheaper lumber."
