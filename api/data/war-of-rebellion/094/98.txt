Ferry. Rebel General Lyon holds same bank below Harpeth, to Fort Donelson, but does not fight gun-boats. Re-enforcements now at Clarksville; will reach here by railroad to-morrow night.

Admiral S. P. LEE,

Clarksville:

I have juts received a report from Lieutenant-Commander Ditch, who says he is informed that the enemy have crossed the river below Harpeth. I will be much obliged, if the Cincinnati can get up to the Harpeth Shoals, if you patrol the river between Clarksville and Harpeth Shoals and destroy their pontoon bridge, if they have one laid down. I shall thank you if you will ascertain the truth of the report of the enemy's crossing the river.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

CLARKSVILLE, December 8, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

Best pilots here report five feet four inches on Harpeth Shoals and river falling rapidly, especially below. My pilot urge that this heavy vessel cannot get up, and cannot get over the bars below, unless she moves down immediately. Please ascertain if there is a reasonable prospect of a rise from above. Do you wish convoy down given to transports now here, or shall they stay, irrespective of my movements, which must be governed by the stage of the river? Cincinnati must not be caught above the bars.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

CLARKSVILLE, December 8, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Quartermaster Donaldson's dispatch to Captain Williams just shown me. From want of water the Cincinnati cannot remain here, and there is no other gun-boat here. Your final disposition in regard to transports should be promptly made. I move down now.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

CLARKSVILLE, December 8, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

Please reply to my offer.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
