HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, Ark., August 2, 1864.

Major-General STEELE,

Little Rock.:

Captain J. B. Nulton, Sixty-first Illinois Infantry, has just returned with scout of 100 men on Celeste from Augusta. He surrounded that place at daylight this morning. Shelby left that place one week ago to-day with his command, on the Memphis road. On Friday he was at Bayou De View, going, as universally reported, to re-enforce Dobbin. Mr. Hough thinks Shelby's force is about 1,500. It is various estimated from that to 3,000. He has four pieces of artillery. Captain Nulton brought down two prisoners, one of whom may turn out to be an officer. I consider the reconnaissance eminently successful.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

There is quite a large force in rear Bayou Des Arc under command of McCray. Shelby was expected at Searcy last Saturday. The country north and south of here is full of rebels, so much so that I am obliged to keep my men along the railroad to prevent its being torn up, and cannot scout as much as I would like to. Colonel Geiger informed me that he telegraphed you in reference to the force in Austin last Friday.l I have since learned that they passed north on Saturday, and
