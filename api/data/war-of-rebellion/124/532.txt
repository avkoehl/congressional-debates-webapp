Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Have arrived and had an interview with Colonel Whipple, whose arrangement seem ot be very proper. The arsenals are provided with adequate guards. The entire force will consist of five regiments of infantry, three batteries of artillery, one company of cavalry; also Union Battery of this city, with four mountain howitzers. This force, whit the city police, will be ample. The draft is going on quietly. In one of the enrollment districts of the Fourth Congressional District, Judge Kelley's district, the crowd is large. I will now see the mayor.

On the 15th in my absence, but by my direction, a telegram* was sent you in reference to the payment of the militia of Pennsylvania now in service. I will be much obliged if you will refer to the dispatch and answer. I regard it as of great importance ot the Government that the men be paid promptly. I would order payment if we had any found for that purpose, and do not know how they can be paid by the State without a call of the Legislature. If possible, I will be pleased to hear from you to- night.
