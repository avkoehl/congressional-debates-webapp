THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Answer. I was employed at the instance of
one of the agents of the Associated Press at
Washington.
Question. Who aided in that report?
Answer. Mr. James O. Clephane and Mr.
James B. Sheridan.
Question. Did you make suoh report?
Answer. I did.
Question. Have you got your short-hand
notes?
Answer. I have. #
Question. Here?
Answer. Yes, air.
Question. Produce them?
Answer. I will do so, [producing a note-
book.]
Question. After yon had made your short-
hand report, what did you do then?
Answer. In company with Mr. Clephane and
Mr. Sheridan I retired to one of the offices in
the Executive Mansion, and wrote out a portion
of my notes.
Question. What did the others do?
Answer. The others wrote other portions of
the same speech.
Question. What was done with the portion
that you wrote?
Answer. It was delivered to Colonel Moore,
Private Secretary of the President, sheet by
sheet as written by me, for revision.
Question. How camcjoa to deliver it to
Colonel Moore?
Answer. I did it at his request.
Question. What did he do with it?
Answer. He read it over and made certain
alterations.
Question. Was the President present while
that was being done ?
Answer. He was not.
Question. Had Colonel Moore taken any
memoranda of the speech, to your knowledge?
Answer. I am not aware whether he had or
not.
Question. Did Colonel Moore show you any
means by which he knew what the President
meant to say, so that he could correct the
speech?
Answer. He did not. He stated to me prior
to the delivery of the speech that he desired
permission to revise the mauuscript, simply
to correct the phraseology, not to make any
change in any substantial matter.
Question. (Handing to the witness the man-
uscript last produced by C. A. Tinker.) Will,
you look and see whether you can find any
portion of the manuscript that you wrote out
there ?
Answer. I recognize some portion of it.
Question. Separate it as quickly asyou can.
[The witness separated the sheets written by
him.]
Answer. I find what I wrote in two different
portions of the speech.
Question. Have you now got the portions,
occurring, you say, in two different portions
of the speech, which you wrote out?
Answer. I have.
Question. Are there any corrections on that
mauuscript?
A nswer. There are quite a number.
Question. In whose handwriting, if you
know?
Answer. In the handwriting of Colonel
Moore, so far as I see.
Question. Have you written out from your
notes since the speech ?
Answer. I have.
Question, (handing a manuscript to the wit-
ness.) Is that it?
Answer. It is.
Question. Is that speech as written out by
you a correct transcript of your notes ?
Answer, (having examined the manuscript.)
It is, with the exception of two important
corrections, which I handed to the committee
a day or two afterward. I do not see them
here.
Question. Do you remember what they were?
Answer. In the sentence "I could express
more by remaining silent and letting silence
speak what I should and what I ought to say,"
SrTPPT.-ciMP'vrTâ€”*7
I think the correction was " and letting silence
speak and you infer," the words "you infer"
having been accidentally omitted. The other
I do not see ; it is the insertion of the word
"overruling" before the words " unerring
Providence."
Cross-examined by Mr. Evarts :
Question. Is the last paper that has been
shown you a transcript of the whole speech ?
Answer. Of the entire speech.
Question. And from your notes exclusively?
Answer. From my notes exclusively.
Question. Have you any doubt that the tran-
script that you made at the Executive Mansion
from your notes was correctly made?
Answer. 1 have no doubt the transcript I
made from my notes at the Executive Mansion
was substantially correctly made. I remem-
ber that, having learned that the manuscript
was to be revised, I took the liberty of making
certain revision myself as I went along, cor-
recting ungrammatical expressions and chang-
ing the order of words in sentences iu certain
instances, corrections of that sort.
Question. Thoso two liberties, then, you took
in writing out your own notes?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Have you ever made any exam-
ination to see what changes you thus made ?
Answer. I have not.
Question. And you cannot now point them
out ?
Answer. I cannot now point them out.
Question. You have made a more recent
transcript from your notes ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. .Did you allow yourself the same
liberties in that ?
Answer. I did not.
Question. That, then, you consider as the
notes as they are ?
Answer. A literal transcript of the notes as
they are, and as they were taken.
Question. Do you report by the same system
of sound, phonography, as it is called, that was
spoken of by Mr. Sheridan?
Answer. I hardly know what system I do
report by. I studied short-hand when I was a
boy going to school, a system of phonography
as then published by Andrews & Boyle, which
I have used for my own purposes since then, and
made various changes from year to year.
Question. Can you phonographic reporters
write out from one another's notes?
Answer. I do not think any one could write
out my notes except myself.
Question. Can you write out anybody else's?
Answer. Probably not, unless written with a
very great degree of accuracy and care.
James-0. Clephane recalled.
By Mr. Manager Butler :
Question, (handing to the witness a part of
the manuscript last produced by C. A. Tinker.)
You have already told us that you took the
speech and wrote it out. Is what I now hand
you the manuscript of your writing out?
Answer. It is.
Question. Has it any corrections upon it ?
Answer. It has quite a number.
Question. Who made those ?
Answer. I presume they were made by Colo-
nel Moore. He took the manuscript as t wrote
it. I cannot testify positively as regards his
handwriting. I am not sulliciently familiar
with it.
Question. Was that manuscript as you wrote
it a correct copy of the speech as made?
Answer. I cannot say that I adhered as
closely to the notes in preparing this report
as I did in regard to the Chronicle.
Question. Was it substantially accurate ?
Answer. It was.
Question. Did you in any case change the
sense?
Answer. Not at all, sir; merely the form of
expression.
Question. And the form of expression, why?
Answer. Oftentimes it tended to obscure the
meaning, and for that reason it was changed;
or the sentence, perhaf>s,was an awkward one,
and it was changed to make it more readable.
Cross-examined by Mr. Evarts:
Question. What rules of change did you
prescribe to yourself in the deviations you
made from your phonographic notes?
Answer. As I have said, I merely changed
the form of expression in order perhaps to
make the meaningmore intelligible or the Sen-
tence less awkward.
Question. That is to say, when the meaning
did not present itself to you as it should, you
made it clearer, did you ?
Answer. I will state, sir, Mr. Johnson is in
the habit of using quite often 
Question. I do not ask you about ^r. John-
son. What I asked you was this: When the
meaning did not present itself to you as it
should, you made it clearer?
Answer. I do not know that I in any case
altered the meaning.
Question. But you madethe meaning clearer?
Answer. I endeavored to do so.
Question. And you did, did you not ?
Answer. I cannot say whether I succeeded
or not.
Question. That was one rule; what other
rule of change did you allow yourself?
Answer. No other.
Question. No grammatical improvement?
Answer. Yes, sir; I may say, if you will
allow me, that very often the singular verb was
used where perhaps the plural ought to be.
Question. You corrected, then, the gram-
mar?
Answer. Yes, sir; in some instances.
Question. Can you suggest any other rule
of change?
Answer. I cannot at the present time.
