Colonel BEVERIDGE,

Pilot Knob:

SIR: Returned from scout last evening, having been as far south as Doniphan. No force at that place nor has there been. Current River prevented my going beyond. Johnson is reported to have ordered his troops to assemble at some point twenty miles south of Doniphan. Believe there is no truth in the report. Certain he would fail if the attempt was made. Unable to bring away the families from the Black River on account of high water.

Respectfully,

JAMES SMITH,

Captain, Commanding Post.
