APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
41
27th Cong.......1st Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury—Mi. Woodbury.
Senate.
this report reach Europe, and are there underslandt-
ble, I think we shall obtain the high reputation of
being very Solomons in wisdom as lo moneyed
matters, and shall succeed, as we ought on such
bases, in obtaining there liberal loans
The whole, sir, is wrong m fundamental princi-
ples. I would call it, except for the high source
whence u emanated, a system of most wretched
quackery m both politics and finance. It savors of
the Biddle school throughout
We should ¡jbegn as well as end in economy
We should report to old fashioned frugality m
expenses, old tenoned thrift byinduury We
should begin as well as advance, by saving and
labor—Dy holding on to our present resouiees—
keeping what we have already got, and instead of
giving them away h'ce ¡he spendthrift, obtaining
more, so fa" as oar real want  require, and as can
be raised without proving too burthensome to th 
people
As the Georgia memon? 1 justly prays, We should
reduce rather than increase expen e«, and (he finan-
cial committees could not too soon call on the Pie
sident and Secretary for speciFc p'ans and items
for reductun, so as *o b-mg down the ajRitsa'e
to the thirteen or fifteen m > ions approved bv tint
memorial and the Senator from Kentucky Tnrre
is not a single cís  pointed out in eitner for re-
trenchment. Let ihem practi e what th«y preach
Let u, not have ecornmy me ->1/ in speeches, bat
extravagance in voies— rearm in generals, but
waste in ail particulars Let us no' begin as n
this session with a proposal to increase judicial
salarie —as at the las s ssk n of tre Sena e after
the 4th of Marcn, with puti ng offkeis on salanes
with no dutips, tor months 'o per orm, and with a1-
vocat'ng addit">"ai allowances to others Above
all, sir, let us no resjrtt) he misera It mftsoides
perat  debtors, by kitirr nd ne . loa' s, to postpone,
merely, the evil day, but to increase greatly, in the
end, the dent, and th n most co-np acen'ly concr
with the Secretary in this re-1' it, that such is o ie
of his "early and effectual measures to pevtnl the
f wther augmentation of the d ct "
He is also to "pievent th s further a gmentation
of the debt,' bv paying a-vay, as before re narked,
three millions of o u resources from lands and mn •
millions as a fourth instalment, and supply the
amount of them by a new loan or increased debt
to the amount of tweive mill on of dcllais He
is to do this 'oo, when it is apparent a> the dene
on your Cipuol, that they have no claim or us for
a dollar due asa dtbt, but really owe us something
like twenty-eight millions The President is a Vir
giman, and not quite so loos* or flat, and, therefore,
does not pretend ney have any such claim Did
it never occur to tre Secretary th"t if there was
any pretence to justify a payment of dus nine mi1-
hons to them as a deposito, t \ ould be mucheas er,
andjust, and ptn'ont, topay if ac< rdng to ¡he
view* of a pía n Yoikee, b> dela-tir it trcj the
twenty ei nt mil! ons hey now owt vt% and ho'diog
them liable for orly the balance.
This woaU be ratner n ore of an "ewly and effec-
tual measure to prevent the a igmen'atwn of th"
debt," than to place in a deotor'  hind  still more
money, without interest, and to proeuie it by ado -
tional borrowing on interest It isvan to expect
more suipluses to ail us I' was quite as vain to
expect them, when tne nreuen¡ Secretary of War
lost a fortification b 11, bv i lsishng oa placing a
rider in it o make a s co d di tnbution of mil-
lions on bis estimates, v üiie he cen ured oth-rs foi
erroueojs e«tt*nates >endj? g o sho\> none we  
likely to occur
It is eqaahv vain to expect relief from a National
Bank of any kind, s-S'de from in unc^nsiulio -
ality and danger, to pjblic liben, I w>ll merel>
say, as to tht constitutional question, tha' the Slate
Rights man or Demoeratrof 1798, who can swal-
low this new fi cal Bank as constitutional, cou d
swallow both Jon"i and the wha'e as easy as he
whale did Jenah alone
Was the new fiscal ag nt of th* President and
the National Bwk of the S -retary, deemed bv
them free from con ,tituuonal objections, on- and
the same institution n form and substance? Or is
one an animal withoa c'aw=, and the other, as ex-
plained to us in trie specal repon, the old hyena or
tigress—with power to issue, circulate, and discount
notes as well as take deposites—w th power to act
out of the Distr ct of Columbia, and for other por-
tions oi the Union, if they please, as well as tor
this District, and t ius involvng all the old objec-
tions to its violation of the Constitution? As well
might we appropriate millions for paupers, roads
and jails in the Disf ct of Columbia, with autho-
rity to pay a certain proportion ot it to such of the
States a* might agree to take it, and call the result
constitutional The consent or dissent of the
States, unle s for altering the Constitution in the
prescribed mode, can never make an act or a char-
ter constitutional which would otherwise be un-
conMi utiona1 It wc uld be irrelevant and absurd
Ac Jrd n&ly, in ! e list clause of th-1 pr pared
charle in his supplemental report, he lUilifips this
provision about the assent of the State , bf empo *•
ermg Congress to nush the Bank wh°re it p'eas-e*,
aid thus i ivoivmg all the power excr„ sed in the
old charters
Bui, as befoie remarked, I do not mean to argue
here the constitutional! y of this measure of relief
which the Secretary proposes, or even its expedí
eney, further than to «ay th s tha' the new Fiscal
Ba"k, with twenty tmUiois of its capital furnished
by us as u iivi'ved in the prrj^ct, and tiat to be

I Fiscal Bank, or Treasury ,or Government Back.and
some of tbeir lofty banners and log cabin carousals
were inscribed "no Government bank " Suchisapart
of the " relief to be anticipated," of which the Pre-
sident speaks—such is one of the "msasurts of ¡re-
storahon and relief" recommended by the Secretary.
" Restoration '" Yes, I fear that not only the Bour-
bons are restored, but all their old and exploded
principles But no more of this now, I am talk-
ing too long, I fear, on some of these marvellous
plans for relief
Let me end, then, by a summary m respect to
them—in their different aspects, as measures to re-
lieve individuals—to relieve States—to relieve the
General Government
I It proposes to relieve individuals, not by recom-
mending any banHrupl law, nor by the Presi-
dent's recommendmi any, which, however ob-
jectionable in many olh'r respec s, would certainly
relieve one class in society, the debtors, but en-
tirely at the expense of another class, the credi-
tors—nor is one of the usual modes of relief re-
cemmendfd, by reducing the t riff and taxes, nor
another by testing the burthen of any pub-
lic debt pressing on them, but by the increase of
taxes or the tsnft something like eight or ten mil-
lions—and by increasing the debt some fifteen or
twenty millions more This, too, when these indi-
viduals are represented to be already suffering
under heavy expenditures, and ourthened and
broken drow \ by the mad measures of the past
Adminivt ation So much for the kind of relief
p < p > pu to ndiv t'udls
a It next p opos -ato relpve the States by giving
ts em thrt e m ihotis m distribution from the lands,
and taking back from them on this account from
three to lout millions by mceased taxation and a
h «her tanf Ihts is conlamul m the Secretary's
s if plemental report, andstron? j mine President's
message, as ore fi the measures by which the
co in ry may orce more re urn "to a state of p¡o«-
penty " Yc>, ihe S ates recavmg this three mil-
lions, rot from an existing surplus, but to be sup-
plied in fact by new taxes, und«r an increased
tariff, pre to find in it a return to a state of pros-
perity, because ihey w II be ft reed to pay back to
the General Government in additional duties, not
only ill t iey received—pay back with one hand
what they received in the oiher, but pay back near
a mil'ion moie tc co er the expenses and losses of
collecting and disn butmg it Unfortunately, too,
the President, though co-n„ienaab / disclaiming
the consti'utional power to assume Sta e debts, or
pay for them cut of the revenue from duties—
justiies this distribution of the public lands as
v rtually within the object of the original cession
of them from the States
In has'e or inadvertence, he overlooks the fact
that immense quan mes of these lands were never
ceop t L/ tne Si , but purcha td by us of foreign
n?nc s, and p id c out of tl  duties, because the
nett rec ip s from a'l Ut lands s nee 1789 are not
yet equal to Ihe expenditures c-innected with them
bj eight or t n millions of dolían He forgets,
then, tL*t m <h'ribú ng the proceeds of sales in
íowa, M s un, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida,
more than rait the present proceed", we are virtu-
ally dis rib i n-r the proceeds of the duties paid fir
them, ai d t tl i-, ex ent assuming Slate debts He
entre? ea th" i icebtcd States themselves also to seo

He nlled ipon thp indebted States to look to the
onerauon of tin- mode of renef One million out
ot the three must go to the States which are not in
deU, of the two r.dhons distnruted to ihe indebted
State , one million will b<? absoibed ia new works,
re| airs of o'd works, &c and one million w 11 be
left for the payment of interest—one twelfth of the
u ho f amount of Ihe annual interest due from tbe
Sta'e What sort of relief was this"! They must,
n ibi« condition rpsort to their own retrenchment,
i"dustrj, ^nd resources, iheir own prudence and
energ es, if the three millions are given, or never
