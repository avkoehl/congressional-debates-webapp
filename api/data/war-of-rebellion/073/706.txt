about twenty-five or thirty yards of the enemy's works, but owing to the entanglement cut by enemy in front of their works, rendering it almost impossible to advance with any rapidity or regularity, and the heavy and destructive fire of the enemy, protected by their works with head-logs, the line was forced to halt, but did not yield one inch of ground. The Eighth Tennessee, Major Jordan, was deployed as rapidly as possible, and one more effort was made to carry the position, supported by five companies of One hundred and fourth Ohio, Captain J. F. Riddle. Notwithstanding every officer and man in the command sprang forward bravely and gallantly, the greater part of the command only succeeded in making a few yards in advance, when the withering fire of the enemy, with difficulties before stated, again forced a halt, holding the ground, however, under a terrific fire, until ordered to withdraw. The Sixteenth Kentucky Volunteer Veteran Infantry was placed on the right with orders to drive a body of the enemy, who, with at least one piece of artillery I supposed, were located on or near the Sandtown road, their fire enfilading the line of brigade; this regiment fully obeyed their orders, and rendered a very important service in protecting the main column from the annoyance aforesaid. I regret to say that the brigade suffered severely in killed and wounded in the efforts made to carry the position. Colonel P. S. Slevin, of the One hundredth Ohio Infantry, was severely wounded while in front of his regiment, cheering and encouraging his men forward; Lieutenant Colonel E. S. Bond, commanding One hundred and twelfth Illinois Infantry, slightly, in leg; Lieutenant Francis C. Johnson, Eighth Tennessee Infantry, killed; Captains Sroufe, Gudgel, and Colcord, of One hundred and twelfth Illinois Infantry, wounded, all slightly; Lieutenants A. K. Tate and I. K. Cramer, One hundredth Ohio, wounded; Captain J. A. Bowers, Eighth Tennessee Infantry, wounded and missing; Lieutenant Bible and Douglas, of the Eighth Tennessee Infantry, wounded, the latter severely; Lieutenant J. Walker, of the same regiment, missing; Captain H. Ford, of One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, wounded slightly, Lieutenant James B. Shane, Sixteenth Kentucky Veteran Infantry, severely. (A detailed statement of casualties is hereto appended, with a statement of all casualties occurring in brigade during time covered by this report.*) Where all behaved so gallantly, it is very difficult to give especial mention to any, but I cannot in justice neglect to bear official testimony to the gallant and heroic conduct of the Eighth Tennessee Infantry officers and men, without any distinction. The list of casualties, however, is their best eulogy, when it is known that the regiment went into the charge with but about 160 muskets. Colonel Slevin's known gallantry and Christian bravery was fully sustained. Lieutenant-Colonel Mottley, of Eleventh Kentucky Infantry; Lieutenant-Colonel Bond, One hundred and twelfth Illinois Infantry; Lieutenant Shane, of Sixteenth Kentucky Veteran Infantry (than whom no braver man lives), with every officer and private engaged in the assault in my command, bravely and nobly did their whole duty, and added, if possible, to their character for bravery and heroic courage. My staff officers fully sustained my heretofore expressed opinion of them. Lieutenant Tracy was slightly wounded some time after assault. After brigade was ordered to retire from front of enemy's work, it was placed in position in works occupied by Fourteenth Corps. 7th, moved into position on ridge near house of Willis;
