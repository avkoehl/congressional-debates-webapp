HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE,October 12, 1864.

[General W. H. JACKSON:]

GENERAL: Scouts from my front, since my last report, inform me that division cavalry passed down the Etowah yesterday in direction of Rome. The party which came out in front of Major Wilson was simply a flanking party. No enemy in my front this side of Euharlee Creek. Lieutenant Taylor and scouts of his are on the railroad, and Captain Preston sent scouts yesterday in rear of the force at Van Wert to ascertain what it was, and particularly if there was infantry following in this direction. They are momentarily expected to report. Lieutenant Taylor will obtain all the information desired, I think, in that quarter. All my scouts are out.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE,October 12, 1864.

[General W. H. JACKSON:]

GENERAL: Major Wilson was on this road with the Sixth yesterday, and only thirty Yankee cavalry came out from the direction of Stilesborough and went back immediately after finding the scouts whom they were chasing had a support. Major W. sent out a party, which followed them three miles from where the Cave Springs road (which you spoke of) turns off from this one, and no enemy was camped on the road. I am now in position at the junction of the two roads, with pickets on the Rome road, and can hear of no enemy. My scouts have not reported this morning, and I infer that there is no Yankee cavalry this side Stilesborough. They are still at Van Wert late last night. My impression is that one brigade is in the vicinity of the latter place, and the other cavalry has gone in direction of Rome, taking the road which runs down the river (Etowah).

Very respectfully,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
