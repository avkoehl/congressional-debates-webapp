PONY MOUNTAIN, January 1, 1864 - 1. 20 p. m.

Captain NORTON,

Chief Signal Officer, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

There seems to be less smoke between Raccoon and Morton's Fords. All else about the same. No usual stir. Heavy smoke back of Raccoon Ford.

HALSTED,

Signal Officer.

CULPEPER, January 1, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

There is as yet no signal station on Cedar Mountain. The detachment of 100 men to guard it have accordingly not been sent. The cavalry pickets are north of Cedar Mountain, and only one-fourth mile on front of the front brigade at Mitchell's Station. I request you to specify when I shall advance the brigade now in rear to Cedar Mountain, because I think such movements should be simultaneous with the new arrangement of the cavalry pickets demanded by such change.

JNO. NEWTON,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 1, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Major-General Pleasonton, commanding Cavalry Corps.

The major-general commanding directs that the cavalry pickets be advanced beyond Cedar Mountain and that every precaution be taken to watch the approach to Cedar Mountain from the right and left, and that instructions be given that in the event of any party of the enemy advancing toward it the guard at the signal station of 100 infantry be immediately warned, as well as the commander of the infantry brigade and division at or near Cedar Mountain.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
