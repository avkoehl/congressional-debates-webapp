Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Atlanta, Ga., September 10, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that during the recent campaign resulting in the capture of Atlanta, the health of the troops has been remarkably good. This is a noteworthy fact, when the severe labor and privations endured by most of your army during the autumn and part of the winter are taken into consideration. For more than four months on short rations, but poorly housed and badly clothed, with no appreciable variation in diet, scurvy naturally prevailed to some extent in most regiments; in all a marked tendency to this disease was observable, and at one time apprehensions were felt that very serious loss would occur from this cause. The symptoms were much abated and notified by the abundant supply of blackberries and green corn which the men obtained on their march, yet there are still remnants of the disease, and great care should be exercised to eradicate it by improved and more varied diet.
