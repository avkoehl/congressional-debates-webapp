MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., January 21, 1863.

Colonel A. STAGER:

The following has just been received from Captain Pennock, Cairo; please send copies to General Halleck and Secretary Stanton:

On the 1st of October last the gunboat service was transferred, by an act of Congress, from the War to the Navy Department, and Rear-Admiral Porter placed in command, who is acting exclusively under the orders of the Navy Department. This department is his, not mine. I am acting under his order, and am ordered to report to him and Navy Department for instructions. Can state that of the fifteen light-draught gunboats, mentioned by General Halleck as being at Cairo, three only are here. One of these has small-pox on board, one already useless for want of steampower, and the third under orders from the admiral. Of the additional boats spoken of as now building, I have no knowledge. I will send your communication to the admiral by the first opportunity. Previous to the admiral's leaving he sent up the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers all the forces he had to spare, and directed their commanders to co-operate with the army.

Fleet Captain, and Commanding Station.
