HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Island Ferry, Tenn., September 23, 1863.

Colonel E. M. MCCOOK,Commanding First Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that instead of sending the three companies down the river to patrol, as I just ordered, you send a small regiment down, to take post somewhere in the vicinity of Williams' Island, with orders to patrol down the river till they meet the patrol coming up from the direction of Jasper. The general suggests either the Fourth or Fifth Kentucky. When the regiment gets down there, let the two companies now down return. Order the commanding officer of the regiment to report here for instructions before starting.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel E. M. MCCOOK,Commanding First Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that you send out scouting parties to scour the country in search of forage, and report the result of their discoveries to these headquarters.

General Rosecrans desires to know what amount of forage there is in the country, as he desires, if possible, to get eight or ten days' forage ahead. Let the scouting parties bring in forage for you. If there are any empty wagons, send them along to haul it.

Respectfully, yours,

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
