HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,November 22, 1864.

CAPTAIN: Nothing of interest to report this morning. Seven deserters came in last night; they give no information of importance. I would suggest that our mortars be directed to fire in the direction of the enemy's forts, as deserters report that they have large reserves in the forts, and are frequently wounded by stray shots from our side.

No casualties this morning.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Captain S. D. SHANNON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
