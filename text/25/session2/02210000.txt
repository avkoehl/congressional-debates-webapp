Mr HOWARD stated that tl e pnnciples ©i which thio bill
wasba^ed had been the unifonn punciples of this Government
ever since its foimation It had always been the policy of thia
Government to lenwm at peace with all nation, anJ to enfoice
ivS neutrality whenevei it become nece&saiy to do so 7his
puneiple wa? adopted in the ac of 1794, whieh he wished the
House to bear m m rid At that time this co jntry be^a n to ieel
the situationm \hich it wa<* pla ed by being called upon by a
foreign power to eníoice lb ntutiah y Congress then pa<^e 1
a law to pitvent th* enhs merit of men, within the jim-die to i
of the Un ted V ate , lor the puipo^e of carrying on hostility
against any Government with which we might be at peace
Ihe bill went on to piovide that no vessel foi this pmpo e,
should be luted out withm otr wateis, and that no vec ->] of i
foreign nation sha 1 ncieaseits aimameufoi the puipo^eoí
carrying o i such war
Thk> bill vested powei in the Piesident to empl y theaimy
and navy ioi th^ purpose of enfoicmg this law   X his bill then
only piovided for the prevention oi the fitting out of naval ex
pedition** and the en tit. mg of soldiers-within our ceiutory, to
carry on war agunst o  nation with winch we might be it
peace    After wai db when a wai broke out between I ranceand
England, it became necessaiy to m ike futthei provision to pte
seive our neutia'itym consequence of the change of cireum
stances    It then became necessary to pievent the fitting out of
privateer*  in our waters, and in addition to the piovisions of the
law ot 1794, it beeame necessary to vest in the Pi evident powet
to authorize tiv1 collectors to seize upon vessels fitting out in
oui wateis    iS  w, the (ace oí things has again changed and it
becomes necessaiy foi us to make iuiilier changes m^om legit 
la'ion    In consequence oí the small numbei oí oui collectois
on the frontiei, it became necessary that the Pie&ident should
call to his aid oihei ofhoeis, foi the puipose ol enforcing out
neutiahty     It became necessaiy ioi us to bung the aid oí the
civil power to co opeiite with the military powei in pie^erv

not desir^. to gee kept up and he hoped the House would make
such pioviston speedily as would supersede the necessity ol
such military opeiatioo     The civil authonty, he maintained,
otigrttitot tobe applied and when it failed, theie would bo tunc
enough *o calí m the aid of the military powti     The civil
powei however, he believed would be amply sufficient to pie
serve oui neutral relations with Canada
With res «d to the amendment of the gentleman ft >m Vu
gima, (Mr Patton) he considered it, in point of sub tame is
prett> neai meeting his views and ior the sake of comptomisc
on this matter, he would have no objection to vote for it Then
ll it wis id pted he thought he could lay beftne the House
some amendments to some of the remaining sections of ihe
bill as would rneet the views ol the membeisol the House gene
raiiv In concluaion, he would sugeicot to the gentleman iroin
New York(Mt Loo'viis) the propriety of moving to leonsiJei
his. amendment, with a view to making some altti iti >ns in the

The que tion then reeuried on agreeing to the amendment of
the g ntleman horn New \oik (Mi  Looms )
Mi MERGER rcpliel to the arguments of the "cntleman
from Maryland, (Mi HovvvRD)and contended that the powei
under th* law*  01 1791 and Islb WdS ample for the purpose of
arub ingi Hhe expeJuions whicn might be undeitik n against
Canada The defect was nor m the law, but in the administra

Mr T0UCJ3Y hoped that the amendment proposed by the
gentleman from 3New York would not be adopted He con
curred iu the sentiments expressed by the gentleman from Vu
gima, (Mr Mbrobb,) that this ameadment, jf incorporated m
thebillj would make it sub=! in allyth act oí 1813 It did not
materially altei the law as it now stands, except that it earned
the law to an extent wh eh he u'teily dcpiecated By the pro
visioiib oi the bill undei con&idt ratiun, if it should bü adopted,
it would authorize the United states Govennient ofhceis to
seize any vessel at any futuie time, of any peibons m Canada,
who might be resisting the Government, and holding them to
secuntv in a large amount Is > matter under what circum
stances the p itnots of Canada might be driven into our borders,
this bill authorized and dnected the offieeis of the United &tate&
Government to seize upon them tudl old them m^euuity to l
laige amount The effect of it then would be that, *f any pci
faoiibj ar any futmetime, who mi^htbe sttu^glm^ against the

disappointed very much, not only as regarded the want of

give up all hopes ftom that quaiier, and throw himself on the
kindness a id justice of his, fuend from Missouri, the chamnan
of the Military Committee (Mr BE\io\)and when he got
such a íeport ftom that committee as he anticipated, he would

February 20, 183S
Sir In obedience to the íe^olution of the Senate of theA14th
instant, I have the honor to ti ansmit herewith a copy of Col
Tayloi s official lepoit of the action <f the ¿6th of December
last between the troops ui der his command and the Seminole
Indians
A1! it has been supposed that some expressions contained m
that report east unmerited censuie upon the Missouri Volun
teei^ I avail myself of the occasion £0 rpmove so erroneous an
unpiession The patriotic feelings which led these brave men
to "volunteer then seivicebin i loríela, and to leave their homes
io on<?,a%t in Kampaign against the Indians was duly appre
ciated by the Pie^identand by this Department and m then
opinion the ple'ge thus given to the country has been an ply
te ¡eemel The fact that they bioke andietired m disorder,
undei the turdeious fne of an enemy as advantageously post
ed as if they had been behind regular entienchments is not
siated to dispaiage the chaiat tei or the efforts of the young sol
dins Thi heavy loss they sustained, m killed and wounded,
ifFoids sufficient proof of the firmness with which they advanc
ed upon the enemy under a galling tire It was not expected
(hat then unaided efforts could drive the enemy from his stiong
hold and the gallant mannei m which they led the at ack con
tnbuted, no doubt, to the success of the day I may be peimit
ted to say, that no blame can rightly be attached to the gallant
offiCPi who commanded the ti oops on that occasion, for plac-
ing the Volunteer  m the fiontrank of the action The enemy
oecupied a position that cou d not be turned, and from which
he cotil lonly be driven by the utmo t efforts of the regular
foicet> The task of stoiining such defences could not he en
