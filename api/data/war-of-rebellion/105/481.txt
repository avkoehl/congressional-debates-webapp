Captain D. McDOUGAL,

Commanding Navy-Yard, Mare Island, Cal.:

CAPTAIN: Brigadier-General Sumner directs me to say that he learns that you have reason to doubt the security of the navy-yard under your command at Mare Island, and that you have not the means of increasing your force so as to put it beyond danger, or to move the temptation presented by its apparent defenseless condition. He therefore informs you that if such is the case, at your request he will send a battery of light artillery for its bettes security.

Headquarters Army, Washington, D. C.

SIR: I have the honor to report that I have found it necessary to withdraw Brevet Major Carleton's company of dragoons from Fort Tejon and to place it at Los Angeles. This will give a command at the latter place of one company of horse and two of infantry. The detachment will be commanded by Major Carleton. I have also to report the arrival of three companies of artillery from Oregon. The battery will take post at the depot at Benicia, and the two foot companies at Fort Alcatraz. I have informed Captain McDougal, the commander of the navy-yard, that, if he does not feel perfectly secure and wishes any further protection, I will place a company of artillery there. Captain Burton has been assigned to the command at Fort Alcatraz.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
