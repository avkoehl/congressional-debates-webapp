gotten up, as you are aware, and there may have been others who deserve special mention; but where all did so well it is useless to name them. To say they were there is enough.

Your obedient servant, &amp;c.,

Major- General MAXEY,

Commanding District.

P. S.- I have just reached home. Will remain five or six days, and then proceed via Doaksville to Shreveport.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS INDIAN DIVISION, Numbers 26. Camp Bragg, September 30, 1864.

I. The thanks of this command are hereby tended to the gallant officers and men of Gano's and Watie's brigades and Howell's battery for the signal successes they have gained over the enemy within his lines and in rear of his fortifications north of the Arkansas River by destroying his forage camps and capturing a magnificent train of 255 loaded wagons and other property (valued at $1,500,000 in United States currency), a large proportion of which they secured and brought out, marching over 300 miles in fourteen days, engaging the enemy victoriously four times, with small loss on our side in numbers. We mourn the death ofthe honored few, among them the promising young soldier, Adjt. D. R. Patterson, of the Seminole Regiment, whose career of usefulness was suddenly terminated at Cabin Creek while at the side of the gallant chieftain, John Jumper, charging the enemy's right. The enemy lost 97 killed, many wounded, and 111 prisoners.
