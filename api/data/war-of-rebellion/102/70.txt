FORT SMITH, ARK., April 11, 1865.

Major-General POPE,

Commanding Military Division of the Missouri:

Your dispatch of this date, that intelligence from other quarters confirms the belief about Kirby Smith's design to move north at once, is received and will be forwarded to General Reynolds. I will immediately send out other scouts, and if possible learn the intention of the enemy and keep you advised. The large amount of supplies here is, in my opinion, a great temptation to the enemy, as my force is not large.

CYRUS BUSSEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

I returned from Gibson to-day. I have no news of any movement of the enemy, who were at last accounts on Red River. I have sent scouts and spies, with orders not to return until they can obtain reliable information of their designs. Will keep you advised.

Commanding officer at Fort Riley and commanding officer at Fort Scott both report Stand Watie at forks of Whitewater and Walnut, which is 100 miles west of Fort Scott and fifty south of Kansas line, with from 600 to 1,500 men, Indians and whites. They have committed some depredations and claim to be the advance of a force moving north from Red river. I have sent all the force I have, 400 mounted men, from Fort Scott out to attack and check them.
