Colonel Jackson or Colonel Arnett:

I am leaving here for Staunton with General Thomas' brigade. I am compelled to go there to meet a force coming up the valley. I should have been too late to do anything by going to Warm Springs and Gatewood's. I could not cross streams. I could not get a force to you for the same reason. Do the best you can. Telegraph to me at Staunton. Fitzhugh Lee encamped near Fincastle last night.

Major-General.

Shortly thereafter, by your order, I moved my regiment to the junction of the Rich Patch road, as it is called, with the railroad and pike leading to Covington.

Here I was ordered to hold my position until the Nineteenth Regiment passed up in the direction of the Island Ford Bridge for some purpose (I then knew not what, but was afterward informed that their purpose was to burn said bridge). I asked, if the enemy advanced upon me in force, if I was to hold my position at all hazards, until the Nineteenth Regiment returned. This question was propounded
