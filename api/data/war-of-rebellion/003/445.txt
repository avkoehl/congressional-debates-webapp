the day before. The party returned to Fredericktown number from 1,200 to 1,500, and will have a column sent out by me upon them by 12 o'clock probably to-day. It is just time for the cars to leave, which precludes the possibility of my reporting more fully.

Respectfully, &amp; c.,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Ironton, Mo., August 16, 1861.

Colonel P. E. BLAND, Sixth Missouri Volunteers:

SIR: As soon as the wagon train is all up you may move with your command to the first convenient place for halting overnight. In the morning move cautiously on to about 10 or 12 miles from here, and await orders from me.

Permit no pressing of horses or other property by your command. The policy meets with my decided disapproval, and must be suppressed.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Ironton, Mo., August 16, 1861.

Colonel J. W. S. ALEXANDER, Twenty-first Illinois Volunteers:

SIR: To-morrow morning reconnoiter the ground in advance of you as far as Marble Creek. There make a halt for further orders, unless you should have such information as would make it an undoubted good move to depart from these instructions. Since you left I have learned that Hardee has returned to his position at Greenville, and is much stronger than has been heretofore supposed. Colonel Hecker has been instructed to join you at Marble Creek, if a practicable road is to be found across. Five companies will leave here to-night following you, and, in case of necessity, can re-enforce you by a forced march.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.

Captain JOHN C. KELTON, Saint Louis, Mo.:

SIR: I send this evening three companies of the Ninth Missouri Regiment to Saint Louis, in accordance with instructions just received. The late hour of receiving the order, and the distance to the railroad depot, precludes the possibility of sending their baggage to-night. That will follow in the morning, however. I have now one regiment of troops 12 miles from here, on the Greenville road, and eight companies at or near Fredericktown. This last is a key-point to the railroad north from here, and should be held. To-night four companies move from here towards the position occupied on the Greenville road.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.
