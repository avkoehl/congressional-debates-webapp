the enemy's batteries continues. The firing on the city continues and has improved, so that our shells fall into the extreme upper part of the city with so much accuracy that the people who had formerly moved there for safety are now moving back toward the burnt district. I am confident that the city can be destroyed entirely by the fire of a large number of 100 and 200 pounder Parrott rifles-say twenty in number.

The work upon the enlargement and improvement of the batteries on Morris Island is diligently continued. The prisoners are well guarded. Brigadier-General Scammon has relieved Brigadier-General Saxton in command of that district.

Information received through Captain D. W. Fox, of the Fifty-fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers, who escaped from Charleston in the disguise of a rebel soldier on the 5th, represents the yellow fever as still prevailing at Charleston, and on the increase. The officers and men of our army recently prisoners of war in that city have all been removed, except the negro soldiers, to Columbia and other places in the northern part of the State. I have made no change in the disposition of the rebel officers in my hands, for the reason that our officers were a long time under fire before these men placed in a corresponding position; that the negro soldiers are still under fire, and I am not officially informed of the removal of the white officers and soldiers. Captain Fox confirms the report of many of our men taking the oath of allegiance to the rebel Government, but states that he believes them to be mostly those men whose terms of service have expired.

The sanitary condition of the department is good. The health of the troops is improving, and no cases of yellow fever have appeared.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., October 20, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that since my communication of he 13th instant nothing of note has transpired in this department except the removal of the rebel prisoners of war from Morris Island, S. C., to Fort Pulaski, Ga., of which I have given full particulars in another communication.

The health of the command is very good. The yellow fever exists in Charleston and in the interior of the rebel lines, but we have, by instituting a strict quarantine, kept it out of the department; no cases have as yet occurred.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff.
