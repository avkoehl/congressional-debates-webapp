Having carried out my instructions I returned and reported in person to the commanding general, from whom I received orders to mount my regiment and take up the line of march, arriving at Sussex Court-House at dark. Soon after arrival at Court-House I sent two companies to take possession of and hold Allen's Bridge across the Nottoway River about 6 miles from the Court-House. At 3 a. m. May 9 marched via Allen's Bridge (which I repaired), my regiment in advance, to the plank road east of the Nottoway, there turned to the left and followed that road to within 9 miles of Petersburg (making a rapid march of 25 miles without halting and a very hot day), there turned to the right, crossed the Petersburg and Norfolk Railroad, destroyed a stringer bridge 35 feet long, crossed the Blackwater, and encamped 2 or 3 miles beyond at Mount Sinai Church, 10 miles from City Point.

May 10, resumed march, arriving at City Point about noon; encamped at City Point. Left City Point May 11. Crossed the river at Bermuda Hundred and bivouacked about 4 miles from Bermuda Hundred. Received an order to detail two companies of my regiment to report to General Smith, which detail I filled with Companies B and H. May 12, resumed march, crossed the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad at Chester Station; arrived at Coalfield Station on Richmond and Danville Railroad. The station was destroyed; bivouacked on the roadside until daylight. May 13, arrived at Powhatan Station, on Danville and Richmond Railroad; burned fifteen double cars loaded with bale straw; burned the station, containing a large amount of Government stores; also tore up a large track of railroad. Arrived at Goode's Bridge, on the Appomattox River; found the bridge partial destroyed by the citizens. Repaired the bridge and succeeded in crossing at dusk. Arrived at Chula Station during the night. Bivouacked until daylight, found the enemy in the vicinity of the station, destroyed one locomotive, and captured several prisoners. May 14, engaged the enemy at Light [Flat Creek] Bridge. Found the enemy in strong position; had quite a brisk skirmish, in which we lost several men killed and wounded. Among the killed was Lieutenant Daniel H. Schriver. Finding we could not remove the enemy from their strong position we were ordered to fall back. The station was destroyed, and we resumed the march to Wellville Station, on the Lynchburg and Petersburg Railroad. On approaching within 4 or 5 miles of Wellville Station my regiment was detached and ordered to proceed to Wilson's Station, 4 miles above Wellville Station, destroying said station and tearing up considerable of the railroad track and burning a large quantity of wood. Thence we proceeded to Blacks and Whites Station, destroying it and a large amount of rebel stores; bivouacked for the night 5 miles from Blacks and Whites Station. May 15, resumed the march to within 7 miles of Hicksford, turned to the left, and proceeded to Jarratt's Station; destroyed said station the second time. Bivouacked at Freeman's Bridge across the Nottoway, which had been destroyed. The bridge was repaired and the command crossed. May 17, returned to City Point about 8 p. m. On arriving within 7 or 8 miles of City Point the rear of my regiment was attacked by 75 or 100 rebel cavalry, killing 1 man. I started in pursuit of the rebels, but failed to overtake them.
