Lieutenant-General GRANT:

When they get all their troops on the south side we may be able to get out and have them all before us.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 22, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I see by yesterday's Chronicle that there is a large number of negro men at New Berne who will not enlist. Newspaper articles are not entirely reliable authority to act upon, but as the chief quartermaster is much in need of about 1,000 men to relieve the same number of enlisted men with, I thought I would inquire of you if this was so, and if it is, to send them here for employment, not to be enlisted.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Telegram received in relation to the unemployed negroes at New Berne. I have reason to believe that there is truth in the report. I will send an energetic staff officer to investigate report and bring up the negroes.

HEADQUARTERS,August 22, 1864-10 a.m.

Major LUDLOW,

Ducth Gap:

Have no Coehorns. Will send an officer from Graham's gun-boat who understands the Sawyer shells. You ought to be able to reach the range of a Coehorn mortar with your Sawyer canister. Try them at 10 degrees elevation; they will give you 600 yards.

Major-General, Commanding.

DUTCH GAP, August 22, 1864-10.50 a.m.

General BUTLER:

Enemy have opened another mortar on us. Got good range, but distance not exact.

LUDLOW,
