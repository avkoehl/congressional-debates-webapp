HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, March 25, 1864

Brigadier-General LEE,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: There should be a picket on the opposite bank of the river, and the navy should be requested to furnish ferriage. Cavalry must be left here. I expect the Third Maryland Cavalry here soon for that service. The company of the Second New York Veterans (mounted) at New Orleans should join the battalion here. The 200 mounted of Scott's Nine Hundred are necessary in Defenses of New Orleans. Give preference for horses arriving in New Orleans to Second New York Veteran Cavalry until they shall be mounted, and them the Second Louisiana.

Very respectfully,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I am informed that there is a small bayou, not laid down on our map, emptying into Red River some 7 miles above; that the bridge crossing it was burned yesterday morning. I mention the report, as the fact might interfere with General Smith's march. If it be desirable to learn the fact I can send to-night.

Yours,

A. L. LEE,

Brigadier-General.
