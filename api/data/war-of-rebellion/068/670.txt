position I gained that I have fallen back to the rifle-pits. My skirmishers are 100 yards in advance of where I was last night. The left of my line advanced with General Cutler for the third time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD.

MAY 12, 1864.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: General Cutler's line advanced after my line was repulsed. I am on his right and join the Seventh Indiana, which was driven back.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD.

MAY 12, 1984 - 12.30 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

The enemy is falling back on our right. Watch him closely in your front, and if you see the battery withdraw, or any indications of having left a weak force in the breast-works, try again to take them. Press them with skirmishers.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 12.50 p. m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have taken personal charge of the picket-line. The battery has been withdrawn down a little ridge, so that it can be loaded and run into battery out of fire of my sharpshooters. The muzzles are plainly visible. The enemy's sharpshooters fire at any one who shows his head. I can see their men occasionally above their breast-works. I had no opportunity to report to you that the enemy advanced upon my line just at dawn this morning, after the Second Corps brigade had been relieved. They came to the breast-works, where that were driven back.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 12, 1864.

General CRAWFORD:

Leave only a skirmish line up in your works, and bring the balance of the division down here. I want you to relieve Griffin at once.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 12, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

Relieve General Griffin's men by putting yours in the place of them in the breast-works, quick.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
