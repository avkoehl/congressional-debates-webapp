Island, every foot of which is within 2,000 yards of your guns so placed for more than 3 miles. If a height is not he best position to meet gun-boats, why have the rebels put their battery at Hawlett's about 50 feet high instead of at Farranr's Island where they would be even with the water? Why is a plunging fire ever though the best? Why build very high castellated forts like Sumter and Calhoun to oppose ships? Rebel General Whiting made a sort of martello tower at Wilmington with logs and sand to resist our ships 60 feet high to mount heavy guns. He was an engineer officer of the army, brought up at the feet of cannon-ball. Under the advice of my chief engineer and in my own judgment I must adhere to the bluff. General Weitzel will point out the site.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

I have ordered the 20-pounder battery to Curtis' house as directed, and it is now there. My opinion as to its proper place against shipping I cannot change at will. Colonel Abbot entertains the same views I do. I respectfully submit that the reasons for constructing works, tier above tier, are other than those referred to by not know how soon it may be required.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
