well contrived to put the people off their guard
It has ever been the trick of ambition, from the
days of Csesar to oui own With all this display
of respect for the popular will, no man ever held
that will in greater contempt, when it came in
conflict with his own, than the late President
Sir, if you desire the proof of it, you shall find
it not only in the heady current of his life, but
in that battle with the legislative powei which
marked his career, his perpetual veto of the rep-
resentative action in the internal improvement
bills, the bank bill, the land bill—all forbidden in
the face of laige majorities of the direct repre-
sentatives of the people—notoriously in the face
of the popular judgment and wish of the day
You shall see it in the famous removal of the de-
posits, in the íefusal to restore them, in that
high-handed measure of holding back the land
bill when it was known that two thirds of both
Houses would have passed it in spite of the veto,
and, above all other acts of contumacy to public
opinion and popular will—the cap sheaf of his
waywardness—his pocketing, as it has been sig-
nificantly termed, of the bill for the repeal of the
Treasury circular.
Sir, it was this hostility to popular control that
led General Jackson to that systematic assault
upon the structure of this Government which I
have termed a revolution, and which ended only
in the subversion of some of the most impoitant
principles of the Constitution. His scheme was
to enlarge the Executive power and to depress the
legislative In the Executive power he saw and
felt the source of unlimited popularity, in the
legislative he was awa'e of a constant, jealous
guaidianship against encroachment, that íestnct-
ed his footsteps to a path in which he had no pa-
tience to walk The one was the parent of pat-
ronage, reward, and partisan alliance, the other
a surly warder of popular rights, whose appro-
priate duty lay in curbing the excursive spirit of
an ambitious chief
I have said, sir, that General Jackson's first
term was employed in maishaling his forces. His
second is distinguished by the developments of
his skill in using them Immediately after his re-
election^ principle of vast impoit and signifi-
cance was announced to the country, with all the
authority which an Executive communication
could confer upon it The scope of this principle
was to set Congiess at defiance by assuming for
the Executive, not only an independence of the
Legislature, but even a superiority over it It
was declared that the Piesident was the repre-
sentative of the American people—coequal with
the legislative power, accountable to the people
and not to Congress for its acts.
And a corollary was deduced from this that the
elections, being appeals to the people, were to be
interpreted as expositions of the public judgment
in favor of the great representative chief, and were
to be taken as confiimations of all his acts, prin-
ciples, and opinions
" It will be for those in whose behalf we all
act,"says the Piesident, in his first message after
his reelection, when giving his reasons for setting
aside the decision of the House of Representatives
in favor of retaining the deposits in the bank, "to
decide whether the executive department of the
Government, in the steps which it has taken on
this subject, has been found in the line of its
duty "
In that appeal to the people, against Congress,
is the first dawn of this new theory of Executive
power. It was moie fully announced afterwards,
in the famous " protest" of April following
" The President," it is there declared, "is the
direct representative of the American people."
And, again:
"The legislative power, subject to the qualified nega
tive of the President, is vested in the Congress of the Uni
ted States, composed of the Semte and House of Kepre
sentatives 1 he ¿xecutive power is vested exclusively m
the President, except tint in the conclusion of treaties and
in certain appointment!, to office, he is to act with the ad
vice and consent of the Senate The Judicial power i.
vested exclusively in the Supreme and othei courts ot the
United States, except in cases of impeachment, for which
purpose the accusatory power is vested in the House ol Jiep
resentatives, and that of hearing and determining in the
Senate But although, for the special purposes which have
been mentioned, there is an occasional intermixture ot tne
powers of the different departments, yet, with these excep
tions, each ol the three great depaitments is independent 01
the others in its sphere of action, and, when it deviates
from that sphere, is rot responsible to the others further
than it is expiessly made so by the Constitution In every
other respect, each of them is the copqual of the other two,
and all are servants of the Amencan people, without power
or right to contiol or censure each other m their service of
their common superior, saveonlym the manner and to the
dent ee which that superior lias prescribed "—Protest, rfpril,
1&J4
The President havinsr thus assumed a position
which enabled him to defy the inspection oi con-
trol of the Legislature, having thus exempted
himself from allaccountabihty—exceptin the ina-
pt actirable foim of impeachment—to the Repre-
sentatives of the nation, and invested himself
with an undefined and hitherto unheard of pre-
tension to the chaiactei of a duect supreme,
national íepresentative, his next step was to
strengthen his vantage-ground by defenses that
should, with no less efficacy, exempt the suboi-
dinate functionaries, thiough whom his measures
were carried into effect, fiom their supposed ac-
countability to the legislative power. It was very
evident that the Executive had gained but half a
conquest while its agents weie exposed to that
supervision of the Legislature which might fright-
en them fiom then paity allegiance to then chief.
To proteetthem agams,t this supervision lequired
a still broader pretension than the last, and thence
arose that famous doctnne of Executive unity
and responsibility which figures so conspicuously
in the promulgation of the new creed of the sec
and term In this cieed tlie Executive is a unit,
and in the President alone rests all the respons-
ibility The officers of Government aie but the
creations of his will, the agents for the peiform-
ance of his duty, accountable to him, and to no
one else     I read, sir, again, from the piotest
" By the Constitution, the Executive power is vested m
the President ot the United States Among the duties nn
posed upon him, and which he is sworn to perform, is th it
of taking care that the law  be faithfully executed Being
thus made responsible for the enure action of the Fiecutive
department, it was but reasonable that the power ot ap
pointing oveiseemg, and controlling those who execute
the laws—a power ill its nature executive—should lemain
m his hands "
And once more, in the same paper.
" The whole Executive power being vested in the Pres
ident, who is responsible for its exeicise, it is a necessary
consequence that he should have a right to employ ag< nts
of his own choice to aid him in [he perlormance ol his du
ties, and to discharge them when he is no longer willing to
bo lesponsible for their acts "
True to this thcoryofexecutive duty andpower,
and very distinctly, sir, to my mmd, denoting its
parentage, we have seen, on a late occasion, the
Postmaster Geneial favoring the countiy with a
practical commentary upon its meaning I will
beg to read a passage from his answer to the ap-
plication for a mandamus in the case of Stockton
& Stokes-
" The executive is a unity The Trainers of the Consti
tution had studied history too well to impose on the eoun
trv a du ided executive The ex< cutive power was \ested
in a President The executive officers are Ins agents, lor
Vihom he is hud responsible by the people, whose a„eiii he
is The acts ot th" executive officers are the acts of the
President Constitutionally he is as responsible for them
as it they were done by himself, though not morally "
Now, sir, it is evident that this accountability
of the subordinate officeis of this Government to
trie President is altogether incompatible with their
responsibility to the National Legislature, or even
with their liability to be inspected or examined
by that Legislature All lesponsibility is con
verged upon the Piesident, and he being, accord-
ing to the theory, the representative of the people,
is accountable only to them, and not to his mere
coequal—or, more properly speaking, in the spirit
of these assumptions, his inferior—the legislative
body, composed as it is of but fiagment repre-
sentations of that same people
When we add, Mr Chanman, to all these pre-
tensions that kindred claim with which this na-
tion was so familiar m the palmy days of Jack-
sonism—the claim to interpret the laws as the
Piesident understood them, without respect to
judicial authority, legislative exposition, or pre-
scuptive usage, but soleiy as the Chief Magis-
trate's green and npejudgment, his passion or his
intellect might suggest—when we add this preten-
sion to the rest, we have a scheme of power so
comprehensive for eveiy purpose of misiule and
corruption as to leave the most absolute cravings
of despot ambition nothing to desire in the con-
struction of the framework of a Government that
might crush every principle of freedom in our
Constitution woith contending for. The wit of
man could not devise a plan of encroachment
upon regulated liberty moie insidious^ progress-
ive, and, finally, more sure to end in absolutism
than this I have so cursonly brought into review.
Eased upon an imperious popularity, (for no Pres-
ident but one so aimed with the people's devotion
could have advanced a step in this perilous ca-
reer,) it assumes for the Executive, successively
—fiist, a representative character, coequal with,
and independent of, the Leglslatuie, then, aright
to regard the result of the elections as a popular
ratification of Executive conduct; then, a con-
structive and exclusive lesponsibility for all sub-
ordinate officers; and, finally, the independent
mterpietation of the laws. The result Of all is,
to give to this lepubhcan nation a Chief Magis-
trate of more powei and less Veal responsibility,
of broader range for mischievous ambition, and
greatei capacity for harm, than may be found m
any constitutional monarch of modern times Sir,
these doctrines have spiung out of the very inso-
lence of power, they are the land-maiks which
tiace the victory of the proud chief over the rights
and laws of a subdued country—
" Till conquest unresisted ceased to please,
And rights submitted left him none to seize "
These assumptions, Mr Charrman, were not
mere political abstractions They were active
elements in all the workings of the late Adminis-
tration They constituted the machinery by
which the grossest abuses in this Government
weie engendeied and scieened from the obseiva-
tion of the public eye. To them may be tiaced
that abundant fiuit of conuption which is now
just beginning to show its hideous rottenness.
Let any one tuin back to the history of " the in-
vestigation," as it is called—" the concealment"
would be its better name—of 1837 There let
him read the Piesident's íefusal to answei inter-
rogatories as to the condition of the Departments,
and his claim to be exempted from question un-
less specific charges were exhibited Let him re-
flect upon the President's arrogant arraignment of
membeis of this House foi theirfreedom of speech
in the debate that pi eceded the appointment of the
committee, the ordei to the Cabinetofficers to dis-
regard the mandate of the committee, and the con-
sequent refusal to answer; the claim to protection
from this examination setup by the President and
bis Cabinet, upon the plea of privilege against
self-inculpation, the peisonal immunity asserted
by them against the search for papers, and finally
the impudent defiance of the committee by the
Postmaster General. Let any man turn to these
proceedings, so recent, so vivid in the recollection
of the nation, and he will at once be able to trace
1 out the impression of this new political philoso-
phy on every feature of that remaikable incident
It will be lemembered, too, sir, that these doc-
trines are altogether of recent date—the coinage
of the last Admimstiation Never before, in the
histoiy of this Government, have they been as-
j seited in theoiy or developed in practice. They
are utterly without precedent or color of former
example     As I have said, sir, they owed therr
I oiigm  to the necessities  of General Jackson's
I scheme of administration—a scheme whose fatal
aim was the prostration of every department of
this Government before the Executive It is curi-
ous to note, in the progress of this revolution,
with what confidence its great author trusted to
the force of profession, when it was necessary to
blind the people against the perception of his real
designs, and how little trouble he gave himself to
reconcile this profession with his practice There
was no sentiment which was paraded more osten-
tatiously before the public eye by the President,
than the declaration of his extreme scruple against
the exercise of doubtful powers There is scarcely
a State paper of his day that does not repeat the
admonition against this easy sin of questionable
power, as the first and gravest to be deprecated.
As if the Piesident were conscious that his temper,
and the habits of his past life, mightlay him open
to the suspicion of this sin, he is careful to dese-
crate it with a peculiar abhonence Now, sir, it
will be found that there has been scarce a power
under our Constitution, which, in the course of
fifty years' administration, has been held doubt-
ful, that General Jackson has not either exercised,
