MARCH 13, 1864.-Skirmish at Los Patricious, Tex.

Report of Major Mat. Nolan, C. S. Army.
HDQRS. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, LINE OF THE NUENCES,Banquete, March 15, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report on Sunday last, 13th instant, at about 7.30 a. m., at or near a place known as Los Patricious, about 50 miles southwest from this point, I succeeded in coming up with a body of the enemy's cavalry posted in a dense muscatel, attacked them at once, and, after a well-contested fight of some fifteen minutes' duration, dispersed and routed them completely. Owing to his position in the muscatel the exact number of the enemy could not be ascertained, but from appearances I believe that there were at least 125 men, completely armed with Burnside carbines, revolvers, and sabers, while my force, composed of detachments from Ware's Cater's, Taylor's Scott's, Richardson's, and Tate's companies, numbered on only 62, many of whom were most indifferently armed. The enemy was commanded by Cecillio Balerio and his son Juan Balerio in person, who at the head of 80 men, charged an fought us most gallantly, and could only be repulsed after desperate fight and at the cost of much blood and property.

The casualties are as follows: Captain Cater's company, Third

* Killed in action.

+ Afterward killed at Jenkins' Ferry.
