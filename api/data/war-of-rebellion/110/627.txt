Lieutenant General J. LONGSTREET,

New Makret, Tenn.:

Dispatch of 21st received.* You must exercise your discretion about retiring, but it is hoped that you will not find it necessary to fall back farther than the vicinity of Morristown and Bean's Station.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY WEST OF ALABAMA,Moore's House, February 22, 1864.

Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Lieutenant Harvey reports from ten miles east of Decatur, on the evening of the 20th, that two brigades of the enemy's infantry were then passing that point, passing westward. The general thinks that Sherman is returning to Vicksburg, and wishes you to send a courier at once to Lieutenant Harvey, near Decatur, directing him to station men below Vicksburg for the purpose of ascertaining whether any troops pass down the Mississippi River. He wishes you also to establish a courier-line, commencing to-morrow morning, between Starkville and Artesia. Headquarters will be at the former place to-morrow. Nothing further from Forrest.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

RICHMOND, VA., February 23, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

Your troops of this day received.+ General Beauregard has not sent troops to General Polk. He was called on to re-enforce you, and has indicated necessity for some delay. The re-enforcement you were called on to send General Polk was for immediate service. Promptitude, I have to repeat, is essential. To hesitate is to fail. General Longstreet quotes you as authority for the statement that the enemy is re-enforcing Knoxville from Chattanooga; if so, the demonstration in your front is probably a mask. To destroy Sherman will be the most immediate and important method of relieving you, and best secures the future supply of your army. Speedy success in Mississippi restores the forces you detached, and adds others to enable you to follow up the advantage.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., February 23, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

Information just received from General Polk indicates that the re-enforcements you were directed to send him are too late. Recall those which have not passed Montgomery.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
