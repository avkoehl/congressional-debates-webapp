I. The commanding general thanks Lieutenant Colonel John Burke, thirty-seventh New York Volunteers, and the handful of brave men of that regiment and the First New Jersey Cavalry, under his command, for their services in the affair at Lee's house, or Belmont, on Occquan Bay on the night of the 28th instant. Their coolness under fire, and the discretion and judgment displayed by Lieutenant Colonel Burke have won the confidence of the commanding general, who recognizes in these qualities the results of discipline and attention to duty.

HEADQUARTERS,Wheeling, January 31, 1862.

Lieutenant-Colonel COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Say to the General-in-Chief in my judgment the public service will be subserved in a higher degree by the appointment as brigadeir, and I will make the sacrifice if necessary. I want hartsuff under my command. The general will remember how much more necessary experienced generals are in the mountains. If the general will give me Hartsuff, and 3,500 men to the Big Sandy and Kanawha column, I will, with his permission, try to cut the Virginia and Tennessee road within six or seven weeks. Will write the general soon. Will the division staff bill pass?
