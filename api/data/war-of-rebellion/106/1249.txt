General GEORGE WRIGHT,

Sacramento, Cal.:

I have received a letter from Governor Blasdel about affairs in Nevada, and think it better to make matters safe for our overland communications, and to send two companies instead of one as ordred yesterday. Please have them go fully mounted from the horses recently purchased. Other horses will be immediately bought to mount the companies remaining at Camp Union.

IRVIN MCDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

OAKLAND, CAL., May 30, 1865.

Brigadier General GEORGE WRIGHT,

Sacramento, Cal.:

If you think it best you may send two companies of the Sixth Infantry from Benicia, instead of the second company of cavalry, making one company of cavalry and two infantry for Nevada. If you decide on this, send for Major O'Brien, at Moterey, to command the infantry battalion.

Major-General, Commanding Department.

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Special Orders, Numbers 119, current series, from your office; also your letter of yesterday. Captain D. McLean, with his company (H), Second Cavalry, will march for Fort Churchill as soon as his horses are shod. I think this company, with Captain Doughty's, now en route for Humboldt, will be ample, with the forces now there, to settle our Indian difficulties in that quarter. As perfect quiet prevails in this city, I had previous to the suggestion of the general determined to withdrawn the provost guard.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,
