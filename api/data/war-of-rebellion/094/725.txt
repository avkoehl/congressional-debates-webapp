that quarter to enable you to meet and defeat it. It would seem from the telegraphic communications which reached these headquarters that your cavalry on picket and outpost duty failed to communicate to you the recent movement of the enemy from Pensacola on Pollard, as the first information on the subject appears to have been given by General Clanton, who, being en route to Mobile, discovered the enemy to be within a few miles of Pollard. If the officer or officers on outpost and picket duty failed to give you prompt and timely notice, the causes should be investigated,a nd if there was neglect of duty, the guilty party should be brought to punishment.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF ALA., MISS., AND EAST LA.,Meridian, December 22, 1864.

Major General FRANK. GARDNER,

Commanding District of Mississippi and East Louisiana, Jackson:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to state to you as follows:

In the present condition of affairs the only important point which should engage the attention of the forces in this department are the defense of Mobile and keeping open the line of communication therewith, and the rendering all practicable assistance and co-operation in the movements of General Hood's army. The latest information from Mobile shows that Major-General Granger with a considerable force (say from 6,000 to 8,000), a large proportion of which is infantry, is east of East Pascagoula. Davidson's cavalry is still at or near West Pascagoula. It is very clear that the concentration of these troops under Granger has reduced greatly the garrison on the Mississippi, and no movement of importance can be undertaken by the enemy from that quarters. At any rate, it is of paramount importance that the line of communication with Mobile should be kept open, as upon it depends not only the safety of Mobile itself, but that of Hood's army, which is dependent upon its remaining unbroken for maintenance in its present position or ulterior operations. You will, therefore, move all the forces which can be collected from Southern and Central Mississippi and East Louisiana, and march them, with as little delay as possible, to some point on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad between Meridian and Mobile, whence, in conjunction with the other cavalry, now outside of Mobile, they can operate against the enemy as opportunity presents itself or can be made, and defend the railroad against any attempt of the enemy to strike it. These troops should be placed under the command of an active cavalry officer, who from his rank may control all the cavalry outside of Mobile in the event of a siege of that city. Gholson's, Mabry's, and the mississippi reserves will constitute the forces in the Northern District of Mississippi, garrisoning Corinth and watching the enemy toward Memphis. The officer whom you assign to the command of the troops whom you send to the Mobile and Ohio Railroad will report in person to the lieutenant-general commanding at department headquarters.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILL. M. LEVY,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
