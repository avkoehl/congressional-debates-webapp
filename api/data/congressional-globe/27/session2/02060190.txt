ncan people that the people of Massachusetts have
a right to dissolve their Untor? That to pray for
such dissolu'ion is justifiable, and that tbey are
really to endorse the movement'? Oh, sir, if they
will, how a few years must have changed them;
how must Massachusetts herself have changed
since the memorable era of 1798, when the South
were ready to dissolve the Union and Massachu-
setts was first among the champions to defend it!
Do gentlemen recollect the shoit and puny answer
given by her to the resolutions of 1798, and which
extorted from James Madison his fajnous report,
as the means of extracür g the dagger which Mas-
sachusetts had plunged into the vi ah of his
Southern feeling? On all the great points of our
glorious Constitution she was then ?& sound as a
roach. How has sae changed' When the ques-
tion to be decided shall be, Has a portion ol the
people of the United States aright to abolish the
Constitntion and Union cf the Uui'ed S ate--, and
is Congress a necessary organ to eft" et that pin-
pose, so that without its ac ion the right ib nuza-
tory? will Massachusetts be found voting a/, while
the South vofs no?
Ah ' but there'.- a reason for it It il the dele -
tation of the South to Anohtion that ¡makes her a
Unionist. And it is the 1 >ve cf the No>'h for
Abolition that has brought her in favor of di'=olu-
uon. The North hai vowed that slavery shall
cea-e, and she resorts to dissolu'ion as the means
to effect it, while the South is equally re6 jived that
slavery shall be maintained, and therefore she ral-
lies under the Constituti m to support v .«d my
colleague over the wa> [\tr Unde.rwood] dec'arts
that it the Umcn is dissdved slaver/ will be abo-
lished. So far hx and the g ntl man f-om Mas a

whose ears he is to sound tlu 'oc m of alarm, and

Abolish slavery—and how!   Why, aeeoi 'mg to
my colleague, it is to be done by all the negroes
running away to Ohio, and some of them through
Ohio into Canada Well, *ir, this may do very
well for Kentucky, but how is this to work in
South Carolina and Georgia? Are they to come
mto Ohio, too, and make a regular march into Ca-
nada? And is no hand to be lifted to interrupt
this grand migration, this modern exodus of two
millions ot people—a migration equal to that of
the Goths and Vandals upon the Roman empire?
The blacks are to come forth as the Israelites did
out of Egypt. ! wonder who is to be their Moses?
Is ¡t the venerable gentleman from Mdssachuse'ts?
A magnificent conception, truly ' Abolish slave-
ry ' and how?   Never in that way.
But th  gentl-man from Massachusetts does not
loi k to this mode of doing Ihe thing, no, he is not
quite so mu'-h of a monomaniac as that He is
not so little read in the pau history of the woHd, or
«o unacquainted with the practical affairs of man-
ki'id, nor so «noble to look into the can es and
iprinss of na íonal revolu ions, as to 1 eheve a

Abolished, slavery must b=; and, m order to effect
that end, the Constitution—'bat venerable, that sa-
cred, that hoi/ ins ruirev who«e p werful arm,
whoso eteTal voice and who-e covering smeld had
been hitherto our prie'e and our safety— he Consti
mtion, with all the oaths of the North to support it,
must first hP hioken down, and then tne Union is
to be abol shed. And how? Bv F'RCe And what
next? Why, then the Puritans, the descendants of
the British regicides, who were driven out of Eng-
land by the oppieisinns and persecutions of the
English rob'Iity, and the Cavaliers, who were du-
ven out by the persecutions of the Puritans, sfter
both haH untelen th'S Noe Ihe water, had buried

Bdt 1 wul p aii uo ' i-gei oc this. I <]o s^y
th-t tv>e Souih is v tiiily interested in the p-?-erva-
t on of i'e Cons ttu'ion, snlitisvpm to liken a
proposition to d -solve thj Union, v-hich involves
th  des'ruc'ion of the Government, ind the termi-
nation of the Republic, t  a propos 'ion  to amend
the Constitution, such as is now under considera-
ration in the other end of this Capitol. That pre-
position seeks to preserve the instrument. It sug-
gests, indeed, a modification of it—a specific mo-
dification of it, and in one particular. The sug-
gestion may be acted on. In the distribution of
the powers of Government you may give more or
give less to the' legislative or to the executive de-
partment, and still the Union will remain; the bonds
which hold us together as one people will be un-
broken. There will still be such a thing as the
United S ates There will be such a thing as the
peoi le of the United States, and there will remain
a Constitution of the United States. That instru-
ment itself has pointed out the only peaceful and
legitimate mode of its own amendment, and that
is the mode in which this amendment is proposed
to be effected The gentleman says that the pro-
position now pending mthe other branch of the le-
gislature does involve a destruction of this Union.
'Oat propositios is a Whig measure. And if what
th  genu-man ray- is true, Wbigery must have
wonderfully charged its physiognomy since the
day when this illustrious gentleman was Presi-
dent of the United S ates, and the distinguished gen-
tleman who proposed that measure was Secretary
of Sate I am myself a Wh'g. I am not, in-
tleed, a very old man; yet it has bsen my fate to
live to see one of these two eminent individuals in-
troduce a proposition to dissolve the Union at one
end of the Capitol, and the other at the other end!
[Laughter, loud and long ]
Oh, sir, "tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the
streets of Ascalon " If the doctrine is true, then
these two great poli'ical leaders have combined to-
gether once more; they ara in common consultation
to overthrow the Constitution, and I suppose that I,
as a good Whig, am kound to follow ihem. The
devil lake me if I c'o. [Convnlsi ms cf laughter]
That is running the game into the ground with a
vengeance.
Tre voting agai .st this pioposition to annul is,
I suppose, to be the rare b< icr of the Democracy
of the North, and when the question of dissolution
(¡hall come up, they alone will be found base
enough to desert their Northern brethren, and vote
tor the go d old Consti ution which their fathers
fr?med, and under wtrch they have hvfd and en-
j jed so much social happiness and prosperity.
Now, I have be n oppo cd to the Demtcracy of
t ip North, and to him who was ones their great
leader, in rr.my of his measures; but when he
s«/or<? by the Eternal that the Union must be pre-
served, then! loved him; f.nd if all his public acts
had been conformable to this, he should have been
my man, too.
Strange, indeed, is the argument, and strange the
positions t.f have seen taken on tins occasion, and
well and tru!" may it be said that we are fahen on
evil times. What a strange spectae'e is exhibited
by this House at th s monivnt' Instead of exert-
ing the legislauve powers conferred npon us and
making the necessary provision for ihe public ser-
vioe, we a^e disputing on points of eonsutut,onal
law, until ?t Ust it-ose disputes are merged in a
question of di solving the Union But who is to
blame? I d d indeed vote for the repeal of the
21st rule, but since I 1 ave ecn what i=, ¡>s I be-
lieve, the real obj-ct ot the «entleman from Mas-
sachusetts—after he h .s avowed himself to be an
a'armi t, and his friejid h-is wareed us to remem-
ber t^at he ib a doscen ant of an E ghsh band of
Gj^eru'r.e-.t ovenhiowcr —I cannot consent to
tru^t him with anv thmp in which the existence of
this Go/ernn>ent yimvi lv d; nor -hall I aitincon-
s ¡entlv Tne 2B ril  s i'l remains in force, and
I rfili n< t leiid the ^ eett'eiiMtt my aid m sunepti-
tioiis'y gi tt,i>¿ int) th s House what tha rule for-
bids.
Thegctl m«i has charged me wi h leiug an
er,c ry o* the Noith, >nd witi a pappose to oppose
h". So far is this irom being trot , tnat I am ready
to d f 1 t-at a m<-,a m my condition can do to re-
mo eail causes of discontent, and to bmd together
the Norih and the South by t <e strongest ties of
a muiual commercial ínterct. 1 would to-morrow,
it I could, rcidei this our American continent
wholly independent of the continent of Europe,
and   wholly independent ot  Great Britain too.
