lished rule that the enemy must hold and keep prisoners, for we always have the chances of rescue. I want those cattle recovered if possible, and any detachments of the enemy left behind Wheeler.

CARTERSVILLE, August 18, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I left Resaca at 11 a. m. this day, having telegraphed to General Steedman upon my arrival from Spring place at 10.30 p. m. 17th instant, asking what disposition he wished made of the troops under my command. Not receiving any answer, I relieved the troops and sent them to their respective commands. I feel confident that I can hold Etowah and Allatoona, but the road is not sufficiently guarded above Kingston to Dalton. Since my arrival here Colonel Watkins telegraphed General McCook he had reliable information that three regiments had left Pine Log and were marching to Fairmount. It is reported that there is a force in the vicinity of Canton. Scouting party sent out yesterday afternoon to Canton have not reported.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 18, 1864-5.30 p. m.

General JOHN E. SMITH:

Now that Wheeler has gone into East Tennessee and we are all right here, I think you had better make up an infantry force out of the Rome and Allatoona garrisons to go to Pine Log and Fairmount, and attack any force remaining in that neighborhood. To-night I will give employment to all the Confederate cavalry here, and General McCook has not enough to venture out alone; you could use troops that are fresh, and the moonlight nights are the very thing for marching.

Major-General, Commanding.
