Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR:

I have the honor to report all quiet along the lines of my command. Will private soldiers who come in to be paroled and who claim the horses which they ride, with their equipments and arms, as private property, be allowed to retain them, or does the provision apply only to officers? Please send me more rolls and paroles.

U. S. Steamer Don, Saint Indigoes, Md.:

Booth was near Bryantown last Saturday, where Doctor Mudd set his ankle, which was broken by a fall from his horse. The utmost vigilance is necessary in the Potomac and Patuxent to prevent his escape. All boats should be searched for and destroyed, and a daily and nightly patrol established on both shores. Inform the people that more than $100,000 is offered for him. Allow none of your boats to leave, except for search elsewhere.

GIDEON WELLES.
