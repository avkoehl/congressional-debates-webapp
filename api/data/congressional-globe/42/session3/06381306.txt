committees :
By Mr. BURCHARD: The petition of
Mrs. B. Foley, for a pension.
My Mr. CARROLL : The memorial of the
bar of the city of Schenectady, New York, for
an increase of the salary of United States

By Mr. McCLELLAND : The petition of
J. W. Clabaugb, Lewis Chapman, S. C. Gra-
ham, Hugh Thompson, Albert Jackson, Ful-
ton L. Patterson, A Smiley, and 88 others,
citizens of Beaver county, Pennsylvania, stat-
ing that about one hundred and sixty-five
Chinese laborers have been imported for a
cutlery company, located in the borough of
Beaver Falls, in said county, thereby causing
the discharge from the works of the white
American mechanics and workmen; that two
hundred more Chinese, direct from China,
are said to be engaged and on the way for the
same cutlery and other works of the same
company, to the exclusion from the works of
our own people; that contracts have been
made, through one of their own race, for long
periods of servitude on their part, at wages so
low as to forbid competition by American
workmen; that their habits are so debasing as
to insure the demoralization and degradation
of all Christian communities brought in con-
tact with them; that their introduction into
the United States, in the manner in which it
is done, shows a manifest attempt to revive
the institution of slavery ; and that it is an act
of bad faith toward the workpeople of Penn-
sylvania and of the United States, inasmuch as
that the protection of thirty-five to fifty per
cent, against the importation of foreign cut-
lery was enacted for the purpose of protecting
the American laborer against cheap foreign
labor ; and asking that, as a means, therefore,
to be saved from such evils, and in behalf of
their own workpeople, Congress will pass a
law prohibiting- any further importation of
Chinese laborers under contracts made in
China; or that it will authorize the free im-
portation from foreign countries of such arti-
cles or manufactures as are or may be pro-
duced in the United States by and through
Chinese cheap labor so contracted for.
By Mr. PERRY, of New York : A letter
from Governor Dix' inclosing a copy of a
preamble and concurrent resolution of the
Senate and Assembly of the State of New
York, opposing the proposition to reduce the
pay and pension of certain veteran officers.
Also, the memorial of citizens of New York,
asking purchase of important original docu-
ments relating to early French discoveries on
the lakes and Mississippi river.
By Mr. VAUGHAN : The petition of William
M. Farrington and others, praying a removal
of bank taxes.

Mr. ANTHONY. I present the memorial
of Mrs. Margaret Hetzel, widow of a United*
