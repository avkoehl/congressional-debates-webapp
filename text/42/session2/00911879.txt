IN SENATE.
Friday, March 22, 1872.
Prayer by the Chaplain, Eev. J. P. New-
man, D. D.
The Secretary proceeded to read the Jour-
nal of yesterday's proceedings.
Mr. SCOTT. I move to dispense with the
reading of the Journal, for the -purpose of tak-
ing up the bill which I got up One day last
week and which I attempted to get up yester-
day morning. I hope 1 may succeed in getting
it up this morning.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Pennsylvania asks unanimous consent
that the reading of the Journal be dispensed
with, and that the Senate take up the bill,
subject to the morning business, which he had
uuanimous consent to consider some days
since, but which was superseded by remarks
of Senators in the nature of personal explan-
ations. Is there objection?
Mr. CHANDLER. I will ask the Senator
to allow me about a minute for a personal
explanation after he gets up his bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
Pennsylvania gave up the morning hour some
days since, when this bill was up by unanimous
consent, to personal explanations, and he now
asks that he may be allowed to take up the bill
to make up for that time.
Mr. CHANDLER. I shall not occupy more
than three minutes.
Mr. SCOTT. If the bill is taken up, I will
yield to the morning business and any personal
explanation that will not take time.
Mr. COLE. What is the bill?
Mr. SCOTT. The one whick 1 attempted
to call up yesterday, and which the Senator
desired to examine, aud 1 hope he has exam-
ined it since.
Mr. COLE. I have had but little time to
do so, and it is a bill of very great importance.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from California objects.
Mr. SCOTT. This is an. important bill, and
as it affects the public interests I will ask that
an early day be fixed for its consideration.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Unless the read-
ing of the Journal be dispensed with, the Sec-
retary must proceed with it.
Mr. RAMSEY. If there is no desire to
have the Journal read, 1 move to dispense with
its reading, and ask the Senate to consider the
biil (H. K. No. 1930) relating to proposals
and contracts for transportation of" the mails
and for other purposes. It is very important
that there should be early action on this bill.
It is a bill regulating mail contracts.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection the reading of the Journal will be
dispensedwith, and the Senator from Minnesota
asks unanimous consent to take up the bill in
regard to straw bids, the Chair understands.
Mr. RAMSEY. That is the proposition.
Mr. CASSERLY. It makes a great deal
of difficulty for uncontested bills from com-
mittees when these arrangements are made,
because it gives a bill which may give rise to
debate the preference over all others.
Mr. RAMSEY. I will say to the Senator
that this bill refers to what may be called
straw bids, -and the lettings will take place
early in April.
