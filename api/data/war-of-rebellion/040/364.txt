Major-General SEDGWICK:

Inclosed dispatch just received from Phillips' house. Their horses are poor. They cannot but be panic-stricken if you give them a sharp blow in the night. Your opportunities are grand beyond question. I know you will improve them. Nothing from the general since you were here.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

The general commanding understands that General Meade has sent General Sykes' division on the Hunting Run. He will establish his line on that, resting on the Rapidan, and extend it in the direction of Chancellorsville, along the line of the Chancellorsville and Ely's Ford road, as far as he can defend it. The general desires that you connect your right with General Sykes' left the same line of road.
