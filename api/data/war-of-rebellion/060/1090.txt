General S. COOPER,

Adjt. and Insp. General, S. C. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of to-day, asking about the whereabouts of Kemper's brigade. I asked for move troops for North Carolina in my letter of 6th instant, which you answered by telegraph (copy of which I send).* I desired them for a certain point- Goldsborough. Your answer left it discretionary with me where to send them. I communicated with General Whiting in regard to them. I have received no reply either by telegram or letter from him. The brigade was needed at Goldsborough for reasons stated in my letter of 6th instant. Colonel Mayo, commanding the brigade, was directed to report to General Whiting upon his arrival at Goldsborough. Also I wrote General Whiting I would not only co-operate, but would, if he was attacked, send all my troops to his support. The point where he thinks he is threatened from is New Berne, and, if so, Kinston must be held. The force at Goldsborough can be thrown to Kinston or Wilmington as we choose. Do you wish the brigade sent
