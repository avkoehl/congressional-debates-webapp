APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[November SO,
35th Cong....1st Sess. Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Senate & Ho. of Reps.
to the surveys which have been executed in that
■Territory, but we have no means of judging of
the correctness of these statements withou t actual
'examination on the ground.
• The extent of the surveys,since the beginning
of the operations in Utah, exhibits a sphere of
field-work embracing 2,000,000 acres, and the
Work executed at a cost of $90,000.
California.—The surveying operations have
•been pushed forward during the last year to a
degree beyond the anticipation of this office, the
liabilities incurred by the late surveyor general
on that score having reached an indebtedness of
upwards of $220,000 to the United States deputy
surveyors, over and above the appropriations.
These accounts for surveys under contracts with
the surveyor general, have been certified by the
latter, and could not be paid for the want of funds
applicable to that service. With a view to pro-
vide means as early as possible to liquidate that
■indebtedness, I have, by your direction, ascer-
tained the amount, and submitted a deficiency
estimate, so that speedy appropriation may be
obtained.
The summary of the field operations in Cali-
fornia since the commencement of the service in
1851 to the present time, consists of 82,000 miles
of lineal surveys, embracing an area of upwards
of 20,000,000 acres, at the aggregate expense of
more than $1,000,000; of which there were sur-
veyed during the last fiscal year, ending 30th June,
1857, 20,000 mifes—equal to 9,000,000 acres.
Oregon.—The progress of the surveys of the
public lands and donation claims have been to
such an extent that it i%expccted the portion of
the Territory between the Cascade Mountains and
-the Pacific ocean will be completed by the oper-
ations of another year. The extension by law
of the surveying system east of the Cascades is
reoommencled.
Washington Territory.—Owing to hostilities
of the Indians, the remoteness of the surveying
region, aparscness of settlements, and the ardu-
ous and perilous nature of the service in that
district, but limited progress in surveying has
been made during the past year; yet the duties
devolved upon the surveyor general at Olympia
have required all his attention.
That officer renews the recommendation of
increase in mileage to deputy surveyors to indem-
nify them for the obstacles encountered in the
density of timber, high wages, and cost of trans-
portation of supplies.
These facts considered, and in view of the re-
moteness of this surveying district from commer-
cial communities, his recommendation is con-
curred in, with the suggestion of increase also in
his compensation.

This table shows the aggregrate from 30th
September, 1856, to 30th September, 1857._ The
statement in the first part of this report is for
the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1857.
At the last session of Congress the following
new land districts were created:
In Kansas, the "Delaware," "Osage," and
" Western" districts.
In Nebraska, the " Nemaha," "South Platte,"
and " Dakotah" districts.
In Wisconsin, the "Chippewa" district.
There were also the " northeastern" and
"northwestern" districts in Minnesota Terri-
tory, established by act of July 8, 1856.
For all these offices the tract books have been
prepared and opened here, all the necessary in-
structions written out, and the blank forms of
various kinds transmitted, by mail and express,
to the respective offices for the above districts,
the registers and receivers for which have entered
upon the performance of their duties.
GEOLOGICAL RECONNOISSANCE IN OREGON AND
WASHINGTON TERRITORIES.
In March, 1851,it was determined by the Sec-
retary of the Interior, under the third section of
the act of 27th September, 1850, pointing out the
manner of making surveys in Oregon, to connect,
with the land surveys in Oregon, a geological
reconnoissance and exploration. With this in
view, a transfer from a fund for similar service
in the northwest was ordered, of ,4*3,500; and
Dr. John Evans was directed, on the 22d March,
1851, to proceed overland to ascertain the general
geology of the country ,jvcst of the Missouri
river, toward the Rocky Mountains; to recon-
noiter for practicable wagon routes leading to
Oregon, over the Rocky Mountains; and, when
there, to aid the surveyor general in obtaining
the elevations of the country along the principal
base and meridian lines, with the latitude and
longitude at the intersection of those lines, and
to keep his expenditures within the limits of the
means placed by the Department under his con- '
trol. '
On the 3d March, 1853, Congress made two
separate appropriations—one of §11,984 25 for
expenses incurred in a geological reconnoissance
in Oregon, undertaken in 1851, and another of
55,000 for completing that geological reconnois-
sance; whereupon 011 the 19th April, 1853, the
geologist was instructed to complete the service
under the latter appropriation, and make his final ;
report thereon; both of which ifppropriations
amounted to $1(5,984 25; and on 3d March, 1855, I
Congress appropriated for this purpose the addi-
tional sum of $23,560; making an aggregate of
$44,044 25.
One item of thelastappropriation was $5,692 25,
011 account of excess of his expenditures over and
above the $5,000, per act of the 3d March, 1853;
another item of $13,000 25, for the completion of
the geological explorations in Oregon and Wash-
ington Territories. In placing the latter item
under the control of the geologist, on March 20,
1855, he was instructed to complete the work,
make final report, and not to exceed it in his dis-
bursements.
The estimates on which the appropriation of
§23,560 was based included a third item of
§4,867 50, which had been expended by Dr. Ev-
ans in cooperating with the expedition, under the
authority of the War Department, for making
the extreme northern railroad exploration from
the Missouri to Washington Territory, thereby
reducing to this extent the amount which has
been appropriated for geological service 111 Oregon
and Washington to $39,776' 75.
Ill the adjustment of Dr. Evans's accounts to
the 4th March last, it is found that he has again
exceeded the amount appropriated for the com-
pletion of the work, and incurred an additional
liability of $3,574 70, to the liquidation of which
there arc 110 means applicable under existing
laws.
_Thc geologist, in a communication of the 13th
November, 1857, states as follows: that " rich
deposits of semi-bituminous coal have been dis-
covered cropping out at various points from the
British possessions to near the boundary of Cal-
ifornia, and are almost inexhaustible in quantity,
and accessible to sail and steam navigation."
"Ores of iron, lead, platinum, and copper,have
been discovered; also, marbles, other limestones,
and valuable rocks for building purposes. The
analysis of the coals, limestones, and minerals,
is completed; also, of many of the soils."
One hundred and five illustrations, and two
hundred and seventy-seven pages of manuscript
are completed, ready forthe engraver and printer.
" All the illustrations and analyses are in sufficient
progress to keep the engraver constantly em-
ployed until the completion of the report."
The illustrations and manuscript referred to, he
has filed in this office; but the complete report,
which antecedent instructions required at his
hands, has not yet been made. He further states
that " the report will be about two thirds the size
of Dr. Owen's report, and will cost, if published
in the same style, $26,526, including the cost of
preparing all the maps and other illustrations."
. This sum, together with his claimed balance on
account of his expenditure over and above the
last appropriation, he states, "will amount to
po,ooo."
The facts in regard to the origin of this service,
and the appropriation for its completion at differ-
ent times, with the progress in it, as reported by
the geologist, are respectfully submitted for the
consideration of Congress.
LANDS ON THE ALABAMA AND FLORIDA LINE.
Plats have been prepared of the strip of lands
in Alabama between the Florida line and Coffee's
line. These to be certified by the Commissioner,
as ex officio Surveyor General, will be furnished to
the authorities of the State of Alabama, and sim-
ilar plats to the register and receiver at Sparta,
within whose district the lands are situated; and
hereafter a considerable body of lands which has
been held in suspense on the southern boundary
of Alabama will be restored to market.
i11 the northeastern or Columbus district, Mis-
sissippi, there are about 32,000 acres of land, the
title to which has been held in suspense for more
than twenty years, because of the indebtedness
of the late Gordon D. Boyd, as receiver.
The mode of proceeding determined upon in
this class of cases is to cancel the sales and re-
store to market about one half of the quantity
above mentioned, on which no money was paid;
and as the purchasers of the residue at marshal's
sale shall pay up for the same, to issue the pat-
ents.
INDIAN RESERVES — TRUST LANDS.
The necessary instructions having been issued,
and steps taken for the location within the Half
Breed, Dakotah or Sioux reserve, of 320,819.48
acres in Minnesota, of the scrip authorized by the
act of 17th July, 1854, and a sufficient time, in
the judgment of this office, having elapsed for
satisfying claims in the reserve, a proclamation,
pursuant to the third section of said act, was
issued, bcaiingdate the 16th September, 1857,for
public sales to take place 111 Maich next of.the
unlocated tracts within the limits of said reserva-
tion.
Tinder the preliminary management of the In-
dian office, the township embraced in the eastern
portion of the Delaware trust lands in Kansas,
certain town lots and blocks in Jacksonville, Del-
aware, Ilardville, Lattaville, and Leavenworth
City, were offered for sale in November last under
proclamation by the President.
The initiative having been taken also at the
same office in regard to the lands within the
reserves of the Ioways, the western part of the
Delaware and the Peorias, Kaskaskias, Piankc-
shaws and WVas, these lands were offered under
proclamation for sale in June and July last.
The Office of Indian Affairs having requested
the aid of the General Land Office in selling the
Indian trust lands, instructions, prepared with
great care, dated 29th September, 1856, in regard
to the first sale, were transmitted to the register
and receiver at Lecompton, directing them to
cooperate with the special commissioner 011 the
part of the Indian Office in selling the lands in
question.
At the second sale, the land officers at Doni-
phan and Lecompton were, on the 10th May,
particularly instructed as to the manner in which
the sales were to be conducted jointly by them-
selves and the special commissioner on the part
of the Indian Office; and those sales were held
and duly closed accordingly.
