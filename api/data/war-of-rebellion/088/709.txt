Major DAVIS:

I rank Major-General Gibbon and of course take command as senior officer. Any papers requiring immediate action you can send to me. You can transact the ordinary business of the department as was usual. As General Butler returns so soon it does not require my presence there.

Major DAVIS:

The Twenty-second Colored Troops is ordered to Bermuda Hundred according to order transmitted by you. They will march at daylight. General Birney thinks the transportation had better be sent to Broadway Landing and thus save the men a tedious march. Please answer whether any reason exists why may not be done.

Major R. S. DAVIS:

Did Lieutenant-General Grant designate the Twenty-second regiment U. S. Colored Troops? It is in the trenches and cannot safety be withdrawn until night. Has General Butler returned?
