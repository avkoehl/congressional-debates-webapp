the prison use this humid cesspool of excrementitious matter as a privy except the sick, and they are compelled to dig small holes near their hovels and use them for the deposit of feces. The stream that flows though the stockade overflowed its low swampy banks in the early part of the season, and the amount of fecal matter deposited a short distance from the outside of the stockade is enormous. At all times of the day and night a most noisome stench arises from the decomposing excrementitious matter deposited in the prison and hospital grounds. From 3,000 to 4,000 sick and wounded men are inside the stockade. The number of medical officers is entirely inadequate for the demand of the sick. At present writing only four medical officers are on duty, whereas to take the proper care of the sick and wounded there should be not less than twenty-five efficient medical officers constantly on duty in the stockade, in order to meet the wants of the sick and keep the proper register and reports. Under the present regime hundreds die in the stockade and are buried whose names and diseases are unknown. This can be remedied by no other means than by a sufficient corps of medical officers. All the medical officers who have been on duty here are detailed men from the militia and contract physicians, and as a matter of course are very inefficient.

2. Nature of hospital accommodations. -The hospital is situated near the southwest corner of the stockade, covering about five acres of ground, inclosed by a frail board fence. A sluggish steam of water flows through the southern part of this lot. The ground is sloping and facing the southeast. On the southwest side of the inclosure is a swamp about 300 yards in width and on the northwest side the stream which flows through the stockade, the banks being very low and subject to overflow. From these swamps arise putrid exhalations at times almost insupportable. It will be seen by the accompanying drawing, A*, that the hospital is but a short distance from the confluence of the branch and the creek, and although on rolling table land it is much lower than the surrounding country, and very near where the branch disembogues from the stockade, occupying a position that all the surrounding depressing agencies would seem to center in the hospital, as well as the stockade. The number of medical officers is deficient, with a few exceptions being composed of men who are either detailed or under contract. On examining the roster I find that twenty-four medical officers are charged to the hospital, and yet but twelve are on duty. The rest either by order of General Brown (at their own request) are off on sick-leave or leave of indulgence. In order to attend to the wants of the sick and wounded not less than thirty efficient medical officers should be on duty in the hospital. Confusion will necessarily occur without this number. From 1,800 to 2,500 patients are crowded into this space. Tents of a very inferior quality are the only means of protection, a majority of the being the small A tents. Temporary bunks are erected in most of them by driving forks into the ground and placing small poles or boards to lay on. A great number of patients are compelled to lie on the ground in consequence of the smallness of the tents. The cooking arrangements are very deficient; two large kettles arrested on a furnace are nearly all the vessels that are used. The bread is baked outside of the hospital in the stockade inclosure. The bread is of the most unhealthy character, being made of coarse, unbolted corn-meal. This of itself, under the most favorable circumstances, must prove a source of great irritation to the bowels. Scurvy, gangrene, and bowel affections are prevailing at present to an
