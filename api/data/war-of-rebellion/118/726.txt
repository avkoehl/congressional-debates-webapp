Secretary's telegraph* of 30th of May received. Alfred Rubery from the evidence is one of the principals in the Chapman affair. Correspondence with sympathizers in victories was conducted by him. he is in confinement at Alcatraz Island. The case is in hands of the U. S. district attorney. No facts have been elicited showing him to be an object of Executive clemency. The feeling here is strong against all such actions.
