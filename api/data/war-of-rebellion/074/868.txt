Report of Captain Robert L. Keen, Twentieth Louisiana Infantry, of operations May 26-29.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH LOUISIANA REGIMENT,In the Field, May 29, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I beg leave to submit the following report of the operations of this command since 26th instant. Major Samuel L. Bishop having been wounded in the intrenchments near New Hope Church, on the morning of the 26th instant I assumed command of the regiment. We remained in this position day and night until the morning of the 28th, being constantly annoyed by an enfilading fire from the enemy's sharpshooters in front of the right of our brigade, rendering it extremely hazardous to send the necessary details for water, &c. The men exhibited the utmost alacrity in the performance of every duty,and eagerly awaited an advance of the enemy. Being relieved we moved toward the right flank of the army, formed in line of battle, and remained until this morning.

Major S. L. Bishop was in command during the operations of Rocky Face Ridge and at Resaca, from 7th to 26th.

Herewith please find report* of casualties in regiment from 7th (when we entered the trenches at Rocky Face Ridge) until date.

Respectfully submitted.

ROBT. L. KEEN,

Captain, Commanding Regiment.

Captain GEORGE NORTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
