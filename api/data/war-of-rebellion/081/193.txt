I have carried the railroad cut. The bank beyond is steep. Crawford's troops are also in the cut, but there is no connection with the Second Corps on my right. Have just put Curtin's brigade on my right.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Captain SANDERS, Headquarters Ninth Corps:

Dispatch received and sent to Birney.* Gibbon's assault was not successful. Say to General Burnside the best way to get out of the enfilading fire is to go ahead. Birney will be pushed ahead.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864-2.30 p.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

General Burnside desires me to inform you that all the division of this corps have been engaged to-day, two of them quite heavily. There is a report that one of them is disorganized. It certainly was driven from the advanced position which it took. The general is now going to the front to make a personal reconnaissance, and will try to let you know the condition of affairs in season and notify you whether he can make the attack in force.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

NINTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-2.30 p.m.

General WILLIAMS:

I am gathering the information necessary to enable me to answer your dispatch in reference to casualties. Will send as soon as received.
