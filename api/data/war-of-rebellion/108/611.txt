He fell in with the sheriff of the county, a true man, who reported that McClellan had landed at Aquia Creek with 30,000 men. There were 50,000 at Fredericksburg waiting to hear of Pope's fight, to help him if beaten, to push on to Richmond should he succeed. I send you corresponding information of an intelligent gentlemen.

Yours, truly,
