THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 29,
tieman that that is useless; beeause if the time for
debate is extended, we shall undoubtedly have
this Kansas question, with which the patience of
the committee has been already abused, brought
up in n little while. I think, sir, wc-can accom-
plish all that is really necessary m the five min-
utes' debate upon amendments.
Mr. STEPHENS* of Georgia. I suggest to
the gentleman from Missouri that he will have
to dispose of the bill m some way. Let it be
reported to the House, and then he can move to
recommit it to the Committee of the Who!e. Oth-
erwise it will' not be in order to extend the time
for debate. It has been limited by the House,
and a motion to reconsider the vote so limiting
it has been laid upon the table. The only way
in which his object can be attained now is t*>r the
committee to do something to the bill and report
its action to the House, and then the House can
recommit it.
Mr. PHELPS. I have every confidence, from
the manifestations that have been made by mem-
bers of the committee, that unanimous consent
will be given to prolong the debate and confine it to
thebillunderconsideration. I have,therefore,sub-
mitted the motion that the committee do now use.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Sneaker having
•resumed the chair, Mr. Daws, of Indiana, re-
ported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of tin- Union lntd had the Union genoialiy
tinder consideration,and particularly the bill (H.
R. No. 202) to appropriate money to supply de-
jiciencies for the paper, printing, binding, and
engraving, ordered by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the Thirty-Third and Thirty-
Fourth Congresses, and had come to no resolu-
tion thereon.
PROPOSITION TO PROLONG DEBATE.
Mr. PHELPS. I ask the unanimous consent
of the House to submita resolution extending the
debate in Committee of the Whole upon House
bill No. 202 until two o'clock to-morrow, and
that the members discussing it shall confine them-
selves to the subject-matter of the bill.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest to the gentleman
from Missouri, whether it would not he better to
bring the bill before the Rouse and allow if to be
discussed in the House proper, whore the rule
limiting debate to the pending pioposinon will be
enforced? if we go back into the Committee of
the Whole, we have no guarantee that other ques-
tions will not be immediately mtioduoed into the
debate. 1 suggest that, by common understand-
ing, the bill be brought before tin4 House and dis-
cussed until to-morrow at two o'clock.
Mr. FLORENCE. I do not desire to interfere
much with the debate at this time, nor to consume
the valuable time of the House, which has been
so much wasted this week. But tf we take up the
bill in the House, what guarantee have we that
the previous question will not be demanded, and
the bill put upon its passage ?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. We can vote
it down.
Mr. FLOPvENCE. True enough we can vote
it down, but if there is a disposition to put a stop
to debate, the previous question can be demanded
and sustained without opportunity being given
to debate the merits of the bill. 1 hope it will be
the general understanding that in committee the
bill shall be discussed upon its merits until two j
o'clock to-morrow. We shall thus attain the end j
desired by the gentleman from Ohio. I
The SPEAKER-. The gentleman from Mis- :
souri asks the unanimous consent of the House j
to introduce a resolution extending the debate on
House bill No. 202 until two o'clock to-morrow. >
Is there objectiorf? !
Mr. SEWARD. T object. '
Mr. GROW. I desire to suggest to the gen-
tleman from Missouri that he ask unanimous con- i
sent that we shall go on and discuss the bill in the
House, and then go back into the committee for
the live minutes'debate.
Mr. PHELPS. I move that the rules be sus- :
pended, and the House re .solve itself into the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union. :
The motion was agreed to.
The rules were accordingly suspended ; and the
House resolved itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Dams, of
Indiana, in the chair,) and resumed the consider- ,
ation of the
PRINTING DEFICIENCY BILL.
Mr. MILLSON. With the consent of the gen-
tleman from Missouri, I will now uubrrut a mo-
' tion which will, I am sure, effect his object, and
j it is the one suggc&ted just now, very properly,
j by the gentleman from Georgia, [Mr. Stephens,]
! and which I rose to make at the time he suggested
i it. It is, sir, that the committee rise and report
i the bill to the House. Then we get rid of the
i resolution of the House closing debate altogether.
■ The House may immediately recommit the bill
: to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, and the committee can, at any moment
' thereafter, when weary of the debate, rise for the
purpose of stopping further debate.
I Mr. PHELPS. As to the future disposition of
j the bill 
I Mr. SEWARD. I shall object to the gentleman
1 consuming an hour in closing the debate because
he waived his privilege. I move that the com-
mittee rise.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair understands
that the gentleman from Missotui only waived it
temporarily, and is entitled to the floor. The
Chair would remark further, that the motion of
the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Millson] is
not in order, or would not be in order pending an
amendment, and the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Burnett] is now
pending.
Mr. PHELPS. Mr. Chairman, the course
which I proposed to the committee would have se-
cured a fair and legitimate discussion upon the sub-
ject-matter under"consideration; and, furthermore,
'it would have reserved to the committee the de-
bate under the five minutes' rule. But the prop-
osition indicated by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Campbell] would have had the effect of preclud-
ing the five minutes'debate. Where,under that
arrangement, could you propose amendments and
debate them ?
I was desirous, sir, of securing to the fullest ex-
| tent debate legitimate to the subject under consid-
I oration; but as the proposition which I have made,
: r ul those which have been submitted by other
| members, have been objected to, we must pursue
1 such course as the rules point out for the consid-
: eration of this bill. Certain it is, that no one can
1 impute to me a desire to preclude discussion of
! the matter now under consideration.
j Much, sir, that I designed to have said tipon
; the merits of this bill has been spoken by the gen-
tleman from Virginia, [Mr. Letcher,] my col-
league upon the Committee of Ways and Means,
; and he has explained to the House some of the
I reasons which influenced the Committee of Ways
; and Means in reporting this bill to the House,
j with the recommendation that it do pass.
| The other day, while this bill was under con-
! sideration, I referred to the various resolutions
j under which the printing had been directed to be
| executed, and, when my time for debate expired,
; I was proceeding to the consideration oftheenor-
i mods expense appertaining to the public printing,
j and was proceeding to show that while there was
'l a great deal of clamor about the emoluments which
!' the Public Printer of the Senate and the Public
j; Printer of the House of Representatives receive,
'! yet, in fact, a large amount of the money paid
j! for public printing was received by persons other
j than the Printer. For the sake of illustrating and
proving this I will refer to some tables. I refer
;■ to tabular statement A, in Miscellaneous Docu-
jj ment No. 3, which I will thank the reporter to
!j insert in the report of my remarks.
II The tabic is as follows:

This statement exhibits the number of copies
of documents ordered by either House of Con-
gress; the cost of printing, folding, and binding;
of engraving maps and plates; the cost of paper
and illustrations; the cost of binding extra copies;
the cost of binding reserved copies; and the total
cost of the work. This tabular statement also
shows the actual cost of each volume of extra
copies of the.works therein mentioned, which
were ordered to be printed. From this it will ap-
pear that the Public Printer, out of the total ex-
penditure of §673,000, only received the sum of
$93,496 63 The cost of dry-pressing isan item
of expenditure which the gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Burnett] objects to, and which he
says is not authorized by existing law. My only
answer in respect to that is this: that it has been
so adjudicated under youract, providing for com-
