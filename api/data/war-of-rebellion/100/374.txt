HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Warrenton, N. C., May 2, 1865.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to say that he has learned that the Roanoke River is so wide that it will be necessary to use both sections of the pontoon bridge to span it. He thinks Robinson's Ford the most practicable point for laying the bridge, adn wishes you to move your command toward that ford to-morrow, taking the road parallel with the railroad, via Chestnut Cross-Roads, as marked on the map. Robinson's Ford is the one next below the ferry, represented on the map where Six-Pound Creek empties into the Roanoke. The general desires that you cause your section of the pontoon bridge to be pushed to the front rapidly, so that there will be as little delay as possible in effecting a crossing.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. E. STRONG,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
