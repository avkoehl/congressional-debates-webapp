As remains of officers have been forwarded to their friends in this manner I trust this request may be granted; specially so, because I see by the Richmond papers that some circumstances of indignity and outrage accompanied the death. You do not war upon the dead as these papers would imply, and would it not be desirable to prevent all supposition that your authorities countenance such acts by delivering the remains to the bereaved family? Major Mulford is empowered to defray any expense that may attend the remains.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
