while scouting from Raytown, Jackson County, down the Little Blue was attacked by Todd and about 100 guerrillas in a pass two miles south of that stream on the road between Pleasant Hill and Independence. Captain Wagoner and 7 men killed; 1 wounded. The guerrillas had 6 killed at the pass, and 2 others by a foot scout that afterward fell in with a squad of them. The enemy seized the stage and carried off their wounded, going easterly in direction of the Sni Hills. The guerrillas had collected for the purpose of attacking the escort of Brigadier General James Totten, inspector-general, Department of the Missouri, who they expected would go through the pass; but he had taken the route by way of Hickman Mills. They missed him. The meeting with Captain Wagoner was an accidental one. One of the two guerrillas killed by the foot was in the uniform of a Confederate officers. As Told was the only officer known to have been dressed in this manner it may be him; but there is no positive information in relation to it.

While bearing testimony to the good conduct of the troops under my command in all branches of the service, and particularly to the Second Colorado Cavalry, yet no one of the brave soldiers in the Central District will pardon me if I fail to do justice to the gallantry, soldierly qualities, and gentlemanly character of Captain Seymour W. Wagoner. He fell at the head of his little of heroes bravely contending against overwhelming odds.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

WARRENSBURG, MO., July 17, 1864-12 m.

I have the honor to report that two guerrillas rode on the ferry-boat, opposite Boonville, and compelled the master to carry them across the river. On landing at the upper part of the town they passed into the country, being joined by one of their comrades. They robbed one citizen of a span of horses and killed another for resisting them when they robbed him. Colonel Wear, Enrolled Missouri Militia, pursued them with a party of citizens, recaptured 3 horses and killed 1 of the guerrillas.
