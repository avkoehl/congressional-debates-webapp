[Mr Wish having nken ihe floor for trip pur-

Mr Rhett reqaested him to vHi it ftr a tor-

Mr WivE having yielded—
Mr Rhett caid he 1 al un.de* stood lb it the gen

Mr. Wiss was understood to say that be did al-

vailing m the country, and that it Ihe new papéis

had made Ue remark because it had afforded the
geniiemmiiom South Carolina [Mr. Rhltt] an
opportunity ot contradicting *t He hop^d, so far
at least ?s Souti Carolina was concrrned, that that

pení>atioi for the gieattr value or America \ cotton compared
with that of Tut key and Egypt This difference has not at all
been estah lahed with aviuw to ptotect one kind moie than the
other   and the results show it
' Though submitted to higher duties (the difference being
formeily 25 hares,) the impoitation of Ameiican cotton has ir
cieased in fifteei years (1S18 to 183°) from 7 659 400 kilo
grammes to 27 3^3 (100 and since the loyal ordinance of the
16 h of lime 1832 has íeduced the difference to 5 f-ancs the
a nount of Amerir an cotton importation has increased nisx
