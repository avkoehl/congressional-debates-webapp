HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Chattahoochee River, Ga., July 10, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel W. T. CLARK,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department and Army of the Tennessee:

COLONEL: In compliance with orders from your headquarters, I left one brigade and two batteries of artillery at Allatoona. As this brigade was small, and in order to carry out the spirit of the roder, I left in addition two regiments detailed from other brigades. Since that time the Forty-first Illinois has reached Allatoona, and has been ordered to remain there. As my command is small, I have the honor to request the Fifty-third Illinois Infantry may be relieved from that post and ordered to report to me for duty in its proper division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major-General.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 10, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy left their works last night, and deserters say they have fallen back across the river.

Very respectfully,

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,July 10, 1864-6.40 a. m.

Respectfully forwarded to Major-General Sherman.

Brigadier-General Gresham has four of his regiments in the enemy's works, and is now getting a battery in position to shell them on the other side of the river. The enemy's sharpshooters are still on the south bank.

Yours, truly,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Near Chattahoochee, July 10, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major General F. P. BLAIR, JR.,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Sherman has directed General Stoneman with his cavalry to move down the river to Campbellton, or below, and, if possible, to get across the river and cut the railroad between Montgomery and Atlanta. To do this will require his whole force. You will, therefore, direct General Leggett to send one of his brigades down immediately to a point in the vicinity of Sandtown Ferry to picket and guard the river at Howell's, Baker's, Sandtown, and Adaholt's (sometimes called Dodge's) Ferries, taking the place of the cavalry pickets. The infantry will march light, and anything required for them
