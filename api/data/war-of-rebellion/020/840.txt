and those under you command for your success in driving back the enemy into the town. I regret exceedingly not being able at this time to re-enforce you with men and guns from South Carolina and Georgia, owing to the threatening attitude of the large forces now concentrated at Port Royal, but I will endeavor to afford you assistance as soon as possible with safety to Charleston or Savannah. Meanwhile your report will be forwarded to the War Department, with the hope that it will be able to order you re-enforcements from the most available quarter.

Your telegram for Enfield rifles and siege guns has been received. The latter cannot now be furnished, but the chief of ordnance has been ordered to supply you with the former if practicable; otherwise with such muskets as he may have available.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
