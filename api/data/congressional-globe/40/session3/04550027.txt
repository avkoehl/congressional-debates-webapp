the result of indolence or incapacity. In the
case of an officer sent before a retiring board
and who may be found incapacitated for active
service, if it be shown that the disability or
incompetency does not '• result from long and
faithful service, from wounds or injury received
in the line of duty, from sickness or exposure
therein, or from any other incident of service,"
the ''officer may be retired upon furlough pay,
or he shall be wholly retired from the service
with one year's pay, at the discretion of the
President." Were this rule made applicable to
those officers in the lower grades who may fail
to pa3s their examination for promotion no
injustice would be done, and the Government
would be relieved from the expense of pension-
ing for life incompetent and useless officers by
wholly retiring them from the service on such
failure, or on a second failure after a reason-
able time for another examination.
LEAGUE ISLAND.
On the 17th of April last a proposed form
of deed of this property, with accompanying
papers, was received from the city of Phila-
delphia and transmitted to the Attorney Gen-
eral for examination, as required by statute.
The investigation of the various titles involved
has necessarily been protracted, and one or
two points suggested by the Attorney General
yet remain to be reported upon. It is thought
that but a short time will elapse before the
title will be perfected and the land become the
property of the United States.
SITE ON THE THAMES RIVER FOR NAVAL PURPOSES.
In my last annual report it was stated that
a tract of land, having a water front of not
less than a mile on the Thames river, near
New London, Connecticut, had been selected
for transfer to the United States, under the
provisions of a clause in the act making ap-
propriations for the naval service, approved
March 2, 1867. The deeds of the property
were offered to the Government by the Gover-
nor of Connecticut on the 22d of May, and
after examination by the Attorney General, as
provided by law, were formally accepted on
the 27th of June, 1868.
The act directing its acceptance provides
that the property shall "be held by the United
States for naval purposes," and good faith re-
quires that action should be taken looking to
its occupancy by some branch of the service.
An appropriation will be needed for inclosing
the land and for the care and preservation of
the buildings. Soon after itsacceptance Com-
modore T. A. Hunt was directed to take charge
of the property and see that no depredations
were made upon it, but for want of an appro-
priation nothing further has been attempted.
TIMBER LANDS.
In my annual report in 1866 attention was
invited to the condition of the lands which had
been set apart by the Government in certain
States of the South for •• the sole purpose of
supplying timber for the Navy of the United
States." A number of agents were for many
years appointed, with considerable salaries
and contingent expenses, to superintend these
reservations and protect them from depreda-
tion: but while payment was promptly made
for their supposed services, payment was also
made for all timber nsed by the Navy. It is
not known that any live oak was ever procured
for the Navy from these reservations, which
are located in Georgia, Mississippi, Florida,
and Louisiana.
The agencies were discontinued during the
rebellion, and since the restoration of peace
no appropriations have been made to revive or
continue them. A suggestion was made in a
former report whether it would not be best for
the Land Office to resume possession of these
lands and put them in the market for sale.
Should this not be done, an appropriation
would seem to be advisable to pay such agents
as may be appointed to protect these lands
against trespassers.
PENSION LAWS.
The second section of an act relating to
pensions, passed at the last session of Con-
gress, provides "that no person shall be enti-
tled to a pension by reason of wounds received
or disease contracted in the service of the
United States subsequently to the passage of
this act, unless the person who was wounded
or contracted the disease was in the line of
duty;" and "if in the naval service, was at the
time borne on the books of some ship or other
vessel of the United States, at sea or in harbor,
actually in commission, or was on bis way, by
direction of competent authority, to the United
States, or to some other vessel or naval sta-
tion." Some of the most hazardous duty in
which naval officers are called upon to engage
is discharged at shore stations, arid when their
names are not borne upon the books of a vessel
actually in commission. It is manifestly un-
just to deprive the family of an officer or sea-
man who may lose his life while engaged in
proving a gun, or firing a salute, or "in the
line of duty" in any other way, of the small
pension heretofore allowed in such cases, be-
cause his name happens to be borne upon the
books of the station instead of a vessel in the
harbor actually in commission. .Within the
past month an officer who had been forty-two
years in the service, has died of disease "con-
tracted in the line of duty" on shore, and
under the provisions of this act his family are
deprived of a pension. It is recommended
that the law be amended in this particular.
NAVAL PENSIONS. '
The naval pension-roll on the lstof Novem-
ber, 1868, was as follows :
1,175 invalids, annually receiving 692,674 39
1,515 widows and children, receiving  247,152 00
36 invalids, under act March 2, 1867, re-
ceiving  4,466 00
2,728 persons, receiving a total amount of..$347,031 19
There has been during the year an increase
on the pension list of 248 persons, calling for
$27,202 96.
PRIZES AND PENSION FUND.
In my annual report for 1865 the proceeds
of the sale of prizes captured during the war
and adjudicated prior to the 1st of November
of that year were given. Since that date most
of the cases then in court have been determ-
ined, and upon the 1st of November of the
present year the gross proceeds of such sales,
as far as returned, amounted to $24,875,344 91;
expenses as far as returned §1,828,000 86;
net proceeds $23,629,627 57.
During the year the naval pension fund has
been increased $1,000,000, making a total at
the present time of $14,000,000.
The act of April 23, 1800, provided " that
all moneys accruing or which have already
accrued to the United States from the sale of
prizes shall be and remain forever a fund for
the payment of pensions and half-pay, should
the same be hereafter granted to the officers
and seamen who may be entitled to receive the
same." In the revision*of the prize law in
1862, when the country was engaged in war,
this provision was reenacted, and subsequently,
upon the recommendation of this Department,
the Secretary of the Navy, as trustee of the
fund, was authorized to invest it in registered
securities of the United States, which was
done at the same rate of interest the Govern-
ment was paying toother creditors, namely, six
per cent, in gold. The statute also provides
that if the income of the fund is more than
sufficient for the payment of pensions, "the
surplus shall be applied to the making of fur-
ther provisions for the comfort of the disabled
officers, seamen, and marines."
In making this my annual report, and stating
the condition of the fund, I have considered it
my duty as trustee to present the foregoing
extracts from the statutes pledging the public
faith that the money arising from the sale of
prizes shall be and forever remain a fund for
the payment of naval pensions and for the
investment in registered bonds bearing interest
in gold. It is difficult to reconcile the act of
July last, which reduces the interest to three
per cent, in currency, with the pledged faith
previously given, which involves the national
honor. Had this loan been made to States or
individuals on the terms specified the contract
would have been literally fulfilled. This fund
belongs unquestionably to the officers, seamen,
end marines of the Navy,who, I>y their courage,
activity, and enterprise, stimulated by the
pledged faith of the Government, captured the
prizes from the avails of which the fund is
derived. ■ The income at the reduced rate t>f
interest—less than is paid by the Government
for any other loan, and payable in what is
called "lawful money" instead of coin, which
is always lawful, and which was originally speci-
fied when the loan was made—may be sufficient
to meet the necessary disbursements for the
pensions at the rates now established. But had
not the income been reduced over fifty per cent,
by the act of July last, the rate of naval pen-
sions might be increased, and I should have
felt it a duty to renew my recommendation for
a revision of the naval pension laws for that
purpose at the present session of Congress.
I cannot in justice to the distinguished naval
officers who have rendered invaluable service
to the country, and by their gallantry contrib-
uted largely to this fund, omit again calling
attention to the fact that the present pension
laws make no provision for pensions to the
families of the admiral, vice, admiral, rear
admirals, commodores, and other grades of
the line and ff, and again' urging that suit-
able provision be made in each of these cases.
