send you an official report of the part taken by the Twenty-eighth Iowa Volunteer Infantry in the expedition from Natchitoches to Sabine Cross-Roads.

The regiment left Natchitoches on the morning of the 6th of April as a part of the Second Brigade, Third Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, and after a rapid march of 35 miles reached Pleasant Hill on the following day at 2 p.m. After a few minutes' pause the regiment was ordered out to support General Lee's cavalry, then engaging the enemy. It went out promptly, near 500 strong, not leaving camp guards.

After advancing 1 mile and waiting one hour we were ordered to return to camp. At 5.30 a.m. the following morning we moved with the division forward to support General Lee's cavalry and one brigade of the Fourth Division, then driving the enemy. On reaching---- Creek, a distance of 10 miles, we were ordered to halt in line of battle, our regiment resting on the right of the division. At 2.30 p.m. we were ordered forward with the division to join Lee's cavalry and the Fourth Division, then engaging the enemy. At 3.30 p.m. reached the field of action and formed on the extreme left of the division, supported by the Twenty-fourth Iowa, and were the first to open fire on the enemy and were soon exposed to the fire of the enemy's battery, which poured shrapnel and shell upon us.

It soon became evident that the enemy were flanking us on the left, and the Twenty-fourth Iowa was sent to protect it. This not being sufficient a small force of cavalry was sent also. Here the regiment advanced 100 yards into the open field, and it soon became evident that this position was untenable and the regiment fell back again. We held our position for two hours, received the constant fire of the enemy's infantry, and being exposed to his artillery, which played with telling effect upon our ranks, our ammunition being exhausted and the enemy already having gained our rear, and having no support whatever, we were compelled to retreat, which we did in the best possible manner with the rest of the division.

We went into the engagement 500 strong and in the best of order. I cannot personate in praises, for all most nobly did their duty. Not one officer flinched, not a man gave back. Colonel John Connell had his horse shot under him early in the action, but remained on the field cheering and urging his men to the last, and it was supposed fell mortally wounded* while retreating from the field. A truer patriot and braver man fell not on that bloody field. Loved most by those who knew him best, his loss to the regiment is irreparable. He possessed not only the respect but the affection of his men. Adjt. J. G. Strong, while heroically and fearlessly doing his duty, was knocked from his horse by a minie-ball, inflicting a severe wound in the right shoulder, and was taken from the field. Having his wound dressed, returned to the field, and continued rallying the men in the thickest of the fire. First Lieutenant H. H. Weaver was wounded in the right cheek while leading his company and compelled to leave the field. Second Lieutenant O. F. Dorrance, while cheering his men in action, was severely wounded in the right hip and had to be borne from the field.

I regret that space will not permit me to speak of all the officers standing up like men and facing the rain of death, and of the privates
