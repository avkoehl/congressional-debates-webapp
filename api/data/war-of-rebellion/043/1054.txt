WE WENT INTO THE FIGHT ABOUT 250 STRONG. FROM THE ENCOMIUMS PASSED BY ALL ON THE CONDUCT OF THIS REGIMENT, NEW JERSEY HAS REASON TO BE PROUD OF HER SONS, WHO ON THIS, AS ON ALL OCCASIONS WHERE IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY, HAVE UPHELD THE HONOR, DIGNITY, AND PATRIOTISM OF THE STATE, AND THE ENVIABLE REPUTATION OF THEIR SIRES.

I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE, GOVERNOR, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

M. H. BEAUMONT,

MAJOR, COMMANDING.

HIS EXCELLENCY JOEL PARKER,

GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.

REPORT OF Major HUGH H. JANEWAY, FIRST NEW JERSEY CAVALRY.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST NEW JERSEY CAVALRY,RAPPAHANNOCK STATION, JUNE 10, 1863.

GOVERNOR: I HAVE THE HONOR TO REPORT THAT THE REGIMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN ANOTHER VERY SEVERE CAVALRY FIGHT. ON THE 8TH INSTANT, THE DIVISION BROKE CAMP AT WARRENTON JUNCTION AND MARCHED TO KELLY'S FORD, WHERE WE BIVOUACKED FOR THE NIGHT. THE NEXT DAY (THE 9TH INSTANT), AT 5 A. M., WE CROSSED THE RIVER AND MOVED ON BRANDY STATION. AS IS USUAL IN TIMES OF DANGER, WE WERE IN THE ADVANCE. MEANWHILE, GENERAL BUFORD WAS FIGHTING HARD OPPOSITE RAPPAHANNOCK STATION. THE OBJECT OF OUR MOVEMENT WAS TO TURN THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE REBELS. COLONEL WYNDHAM WAS IN COMMAND OF THE SECOND BRIGADE, COMPOSED OF THE FIRST NEW JERSEY, FIRST INDIANA, AND FIRST PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY, AND THE COMMAND OF OUR REGIMENT DEVOLVED UPON LIEUTENANT-COLONEL BRODRICK. CAPTAIN YORKE, OF COMPANY I, HAD THE ADVANCE GUARD, COMPOSED OF COMPANIES C AND I. HE MOVED HIS MEN SO CAREFULLY THAT HE CAPTURED EVERY VEDETTE ON THE ROAD, SO THAT THE FIRST INTIMATION THE ENEMY HAD OF OUR BEING IN THEIR REAR WAS BY SEEING THE HEAD OF OUR COLUMN DEBOUCH FROM THE WOODS. COLONEL WYNDHAM MOVED HIS TROOPS WITH SUCH CELERITY THAT WE WERE UPON THEM ALMOST BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE OF OUR VICINITY. THE FIGHT LASTED FOUR HOURS, AND WAS A CONTINUAL SUCCESSION OF THE MOST BRILLIANT CHARGED EVER MADE. EVERY OFFICER BEHAVED WITH THE UTMOST BRAVERY AND COOLNESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MEN TO BEHAVE BETTER THAN DID OURS. THEY PROVED THEMSELVES WELL WORTHY OF THE STATE FROM WHICH THEY COME. MORE CANNOT BE SAID IN THEIR PRAISE. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL BRODRICK AND MAJOR SHELMIRE WERE BOTH WOUNDED AND TAKEN WHILE LEADING ONE OF THE NUMEROUS CHARGES. ACCOUNTS OF THE NATURE OF THEIR CAPTURE ARE SO CONFLICTING THAT I DEFER SENDING ANY STATEMENT REGARDING IT TILL I LEARN SOMETHING DEFINITE; BUT THAT THEY BOTH BEHAVED WITH THE GREATEST DARING AND GALLANTRY, THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION. CAPTAIN SAWYER, COMPANY K, AND LIEUTENANT CROCKER, COMPANY H, ARE ALSO PRISONERS, BUT NOT THOUGHT TO BE WOUNDED. CAPTAIN LUCAS, COMPANY F, CAPTAIN MAULSBURY, AND ADJUTANT KITCHEN, WHILE IN THE THICKEST OF THE FRAY, HAD THEIR HORSES SHOT UNDER THEM; THAT OF ADJUTANT KITCHEN FELL DEAD, CARRYING HIM ALONG WITH IT. HIS ESCAPE SEEMS ALMOST MIRACULOUS. WHEN THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO RETIRE, OUR REGIMENT COVERED THE REAR. I AM TOLD THAT GENERAL GREGG EX-
