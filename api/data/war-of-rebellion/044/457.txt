Captain Brown, of Andrew's, and Captain Page, of Carter's battalions, and Lieutenant [William M] Brown, of the First Virginia Artillery, were also wounded in this engagement. In addition, there were 21 killed and 104 wounded. One Napoleon was captured, and exchanged by Lieutenant -Colonel Jones for one of his, disabled. In this engagement, as in the one at Winchester, the officers and men behaved with the greatest gallantry, fully sustaining the high character which they had previously borne. After crossing into Virginia, there was no serious fighting. Colonel Carter fired a few shots at the enemy advancing upon our rear in crossing the Potomac, and also fired upon them as they attempted to cross at Manassas Gap. Owing to the loss by capture of the transportation and forges (with few exceptions) of the First Virginia Artillery and Carter's and Nelson's battalions, and the loss of 92 horses at Gettysburg, the artillery of the corps has had great difficulties to contend with. They brought off everything from across the river to this point with the exception of one caisson, for the loss of which the officer responsible is now under charges. The horses are in low order, but are improving.

Very respectfully,

J. THOMPSON BROWN,

Colonel, and Acting Chief of Artillery, Second Corps.

Major A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
