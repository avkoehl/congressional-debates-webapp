warded your letter to him. He was very much disappointed at his failure to procure the team and wagon. I did all I could in the matter, but Major Mason said that General H. refused even to consider the paper. I return it to you with indorsements. Inclosed I send a copy of the report* made out 1st of July by Washington. I have shown to Major Smith, who paid us a short visit, what had become of the excess of transportation. You must recollect that there is more transportation allowed now in this army than under Order Numbers 17. General Hood said to Major Smith and myself yesterday that he would have to increase his supply trains 300 wagons. These he expected to get as follows: Two hundred and twenty from Union Springs and eighty from train of reserve artillery, now on its way here from Macon. Since our conversation with him, I learn through Major George that he has promised the corps commanders that they may have such of the wagons as they may want to complete and better their transportation, exchanging their worst wagons for them. If so, he will have a very poor supply train of it, besides it will be reduced to less than 100 wagons, at least 120 being required to fill up present deficiencies. I will see him early to-morrow on the subject, and urge him not to break up the train and tell him that I cannot supply its place with others. He has not yet given up his idea of mounting cavalry, and say he will see the President to-morrow and ask him to issue an order authorizing it. I will do my best in the way of impressing him with the importance of saving horses. He desired Major Smith to have at least 150 collected together to be held in reserve to replace those which would be killed in battle, which he intimated would not long be delayed. I think Ii will be able to send you a report in a few days on the points you were anxious about. All my officers, except Berry, who is sick, and Chaffie, are hard at work riding constantly, in getting information. Clark's train gas been broken up, and is now in DIVISION ordnance trains. Ayer seems to mean to co-operate with us, but is trying to make us do a great deal of his work. Both he and the general seem to think it is my duty to supply the negro teamsters, which I declined to do, but they still continue to trouble me with it. I will show them your dispatch to Landis on the subject to-morrow. The order for the impressment of animals in front of our lines [was] issued on the 24th, but the officers ordered to report to me to carry it out have not reported yet, and I fear they are all very inefficient. I hope, however, to be able to get 75 or 100 head of animals, which would doubtless go to the enemy if we do not. I understand we are now issuing rations to 65,000 men here-we have 30,000 muskets in the three corps - which is a great increase. I hope it will continue.

SEPTEMBER 28, 1864.

From reports received from corps inspectors I find we will have to take 103 of the wagons now on the way up from Union Springs to complete the transportation allowed by orders, reducing the train for supplies that much. This deficiency General Hood says we must make up. The movement he intends making will require 600 supply wagons, and I have advised Major Smith of it. It is understood that we move to-morrow at 8 o'clock toward Powder Springs. Where we will go to, or what the campaign is, I cannot understand. I fear, however, it is to be a sort of forlorn hope, and that many of us will land in some Northern prison. My health is not at all good; have been suffering very much
