tieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Both Colonels Kirby and Taylor well deserve, and have earned, promotion.

I must also make honorable mention of the two batteries under my command, Captain A. Morrison, Fifth Indiana, and Captain Jacob Ziegler, Battery B, Independent Pennsylvania. They rendered excellent service daily, and always courted exposed positions, never slackening fire, however much exposed, either to the artillery or musketry of the enemy.

I desire also to call favorable attention to my staff, who served me most cheerfully and efficiently, and relieved me of much care and labor during the campaign. Major Sinclair, assistant adjutant-general; Major Fairbanks, Thirty-first Indiana Volunteers, inspector, and who was untiring in his care of the picket-line; Captain J. D. Moxley, Captain W. H. Greenwood and Lieutenant L. L. Taylor, aides-de-camp; Lieutenant Croxton, Fifty-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, ordnance officer, who always kept his ammunition just where it was needed; Surgeon Brumley, U. S. Volunteers, who provided most fully for the comfort of our wounded, and Captain Hopkins, assistant quartermaster, and Captain Kniffin, commissary of subsistence, all deserve well of the Government.

I have previously mentioned the death of two of my chiefs of artillery, Captains Simonson and McDowell. The place was well and ably filled by Captain Thomasson, First Kentucky Battery.

Captain J. W. Steele, Forty-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, topographical engineer, rendered good and efficient service, and Captain Greenwood, besides his duty as aide-de-camp, found time to make occupied by the army.

Appended is a tabular monthly statement of the casualties of the division from the 1st of May to the 31st of July, 1864.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General, Commanding First Division.
