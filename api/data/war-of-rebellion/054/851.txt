HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FOURTH CORPS,Shellmound, Tennessee, October 29, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: The head of my column is at Shellmound. I left one regiment (One hundred and first Ohio, Colonel Kirby), at Rankin's Ferry, with one company Sixteenth Illinois and two companies Second Michigan Cavalry, and the four-gun battery (Lieutenant Sahm) to protect the barges of rations and to cover the laying of the pontoon in case of removal. Rankin's Ferry seems to be best point for the bridge, all things considered, and it seems to have been unfortunate that it was not placed there originally. A much smaller force can protect it there then here. My troops are passing to south side of river, as ordered, and General Hooker advised of their position. I am, in communication with General Hooker, who was at Brown's Ferry this a.m. My aide-de-camp advises me at 12 m. to-day, from Whiteside's, that General Hooker is at Lookout Mountain and that all is quiet in front, I will await General Hooker's orders or further orders from General Thomas.

I am, very truly, yours,

CHARLES CRUFT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
