Major-General ROSECRANS,

Jefferson City:

My advance found at Warrensburg to-day that rebels have left Sedalia, going toward Lexington, where heavy artillery firing was heard to-day. I am now moving down on Lexington road, where I suppose the enemy may move. My advance must have reached Lexington this morning, but it was not strong enough to fight a battle.
