products, and the resources of the several States

companied by a bill (S. No. 383) for the relief

1 MRS, ABBY GREEN.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee on Claims,
to whom was referred the petition of Mrs. Abby
Green, praying for relief, have instructed me
to report a joint resolution (S. R. No._112) for
the relief of Mrs. Abby Green. This is a case
which appeals in the strongest degree to the
justice and to the generosity of Congress. It
is a joint resolution for the relief of a woman
in Richmond through whose agency one hun-
dred and nine of our men escaped from the
Libby prison. The services which she rendered
to them were at the risk of her life, and at the
sacrifice of her property. The committee hav-
ing had the amplest testimony to the fact, from
Colonel Streight, and the other officers who
escaped through her exertions, have instructed
me to report a joint resolution granting her
ยง1,500, which is the same amount that was
paid to another woman who well deserved it,
but who did not render so much service as this
lady. I ask for its present, consideration.
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution
was read twice by its title and considered as
in Committee of the Whole. As it appears
from the evidence of General H. C. Hobart,
Colonel A. D. Streight, and Captain John F.
Porter, jr., late of the United States Army,
that Mrs. Abby Green, then of Richmond, Vir-
ginia, by her courage, patriotic devotion, and
assistance, from May, 1863, to February, 1864,
in enabling one hundred and nine officers and
soldiers of the United States to make their
escape from the Libby prison in Richmond, Vir-
ginia, and from the hands of our enemies, has
deserved well of the country, the joint resolu-
tion proposes that the sum of ยง1,500 be paid
to her, her heirs, or administrator in compen-
sation for her services.
The joint resolution was reported to the
Senate without amendment, ordered to bn en-
grossed for a third reading, read the third time,
and passed.
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. CHANDLER asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.

enue-cutters," approved April 20,1866; which
was read twice by its title, and referred to the
Committee on Commerce.
Mr. TRUMBULL asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 382) to change the place of holding court
in the northern district of Georgia; which was

printed and go upon the Calendar, as it has
already been considered in committee.
It was so ordered.
NATIONAL PARK PRESIDENTIAL MANSION.
Mr. WADE. I offer the following resolu-
tion of inquiry, and ask for its present consid-
eration :
Rcmhrd, That the Committee on tho District of
Columbia bo instructed to inquire into tho expe-
diency of the United States acquiring the title to tho
land between Maryland avenue and Pennsylvania
avenue, cast of the Capitol to Nineteenth street, for

ceeded to consider the resolution.

that is already before the Committee on Pub-
lic Buildings and Grounds.

the subject, under consideration.
Mr. YVADE. I am told that the Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds have this
subject under consideration, and 1 will change
the reference of the inquiry to that committee.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will
require an alteration of the phraseology of the
resolution inasmuch as the resolution directs
the inquiry to the Committee on the District
of Columbia.
Mr. WADE. 1 move to amend it, then, by
striking out " Committee on the District of
Columbia" and inserting "Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds."
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The reso-
lution will be so amended at the instance of
the mover.
The resolution, as modified, was adopted.

Mr. WILLIAMS. 1 wish to take up a pri-
vate claim, but I give way to that.

sires to make certain amendments to this bill,
but has not the memoranda with him to enable
him to do so; Jie desires, therefore, to have
the bill laid over for to-day. It is quite agree-
able to the committee to let it pass over in-

nished to the Army of the United States.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a

Mr. SHERMAN. I believe this bill was up
before. It is a very important bill certainly.
Mr. POLAND. Yes, sir ; it is a bill of some
importance.
Mr. SHERMAN. Is there any written
report accompanying tho bill ?
Mr. POLAND. There is not.
Mr. SHERMAN. I hope the Senator will
allow it to lay over until to-morrow. It is a
very important matter.
Mr. POLAND. I can hardly allow that. I
have been at work for about three months try-
ing to get it before the Senate.
Mr. GRIMES. Let us have it read. then.
Mr. SHERMAN. I should like to have the
bill read, at any rate, before the vote is taken
on its passage. I hope it will either be read
at the desk or that I shall be allowed time to

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill
will be read.
