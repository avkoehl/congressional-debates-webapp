Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DAVIDSON,

First Lieutenant, Veteran Reserve Corps, Inspecting Officer.

CHICAGO, February 12, 1865.

Brevet Brigadier-General HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners:

If prisoners of war make application to take the oath and be released and refuse to be exchanged, will they be released, and when? Probably one-third would so refuse if official assurance can be given that they will be released within a reasonable time.

B. J. SWEET,

Colonel, Commanding.

RICHMOND, February 12, 1865. (Received 13th.)

General BRAGG:

It is necessary to move prisoners from Florence-about 10,000. Can they be accommodated at or near Wilmington? Colonel Ould will probably exchange them at that point in about two weeks.

By order:

J. A. CAMPBELL.

[Indorsement.]

General HOKE:

General Bragg ought certainly to be now in Richmond, and will there determine this subject, I should think.
