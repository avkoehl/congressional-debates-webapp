HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, December 23, 1862.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Left Wing:

GENERAL: The general commanding has received intelligence from Gallatin of the presence of over 7,000 of the enemy's cavalry, perhaps supported by infantry, within 4 miles of the camp at Bledsoe's Creek; he therefore desires you to have your command ready to march at daylight, with three days' cooked rations in their haversacks; since if the presence of so large a force of the enemy at that point is confirmed, his design is to adopt vigorous measures to cut off their retreat entirely. Have the goodness to communicate the same orders and intelligence by signal to General Stanley. Cause arrangements to be made for your train in accordance with orders already given. The enemy will probably make a demonstration with the Gallatin movement. The intention is to make him any pay for it.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
