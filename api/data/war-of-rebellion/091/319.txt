WHITE PLAINS, VA., October 8, 1864-9.50 a.m.

(Received 4.45 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

The railroad is open to Rectortown and trains can run there. The telegraph is completed two miles beyond here. It can of no farther for want of wire, which is expected by train this morning. The railroad construction train is also here awaiting material and for wood and water. Two locomotives were off the track last night, which delayed the return trains until this morning. The cavalry from Falls Church are at Manassas Junction delayed by the return trains. As soon as they arrive, and I can give the necessary orders for their disposal, I shall go to Rectortown. I do not think the track is in as good condition as it seemed at first. Heavy trains passing over it have shown that many of the ties are so much decayed as to be unable to hold the spikes, the track consequently spreads and the trains go off. The cavalry that arrived last night left at daylight this morning to find Mosby. The new regiments who were guarding the roads in front have not done as well as they should.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
