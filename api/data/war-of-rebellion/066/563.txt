John's Island to-night. The party embarking at Swamp Angel may be destined for Haskell or Cheves. Keep vigilant watch. One of our gun-boats in rear of Johnson.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 6, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House, James Island:

The commanding general approves your disposition. For the night you can use all the available troops you have with you. The enemy is in strong force on the dam at the Gervais' and Burden's plantations, with a view it is believed of establishing batteries at Saxby's just across the river form Pringle. Have the steam-boat Chesterfield kept in the Wappoo Cut hidden from the enemy.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
