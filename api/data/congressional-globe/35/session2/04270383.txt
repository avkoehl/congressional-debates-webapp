in all setiousness. At the present sta^e of the
session, and in the present state of public busi-
ness, the practice of dropping Saturday out and
having the public business unattended to, is all
wrom*; and I do not only wish by my vote, but
by my1 words, to enter my protest against it.
Whilst claimants arp here hanging- around the
Capitol with tears m their eyes, importuning you
to transact their bigness, you deliberately ad-
journ over from Friday to Monday, in the fifth or
sixth week of a short session; and this, after
giving up ten days to the holidays. I simply pro-
test that this is wrons; entiicly in reference to tho
public business, and in reference to that e;icat
duty which we owe to those who have claims
ogamst the Government. If we could prolong tins
session beyond the 4th March, I would say that
it was all right; let us take our playtime in the
wittier and work m the Hot days of summer; but
that cannot be; on the 3d of March we must ad-
journ

estsiof private claims unattended to, v/aphns the j
time which belongs to the public,,after this fa;
ion ? I do hope that the mo'ion of my fi lend from
Arkansas will be voted down; that hereafter, on
each legislative day during the remainder of this
bession, we shall devote ourselves diligently to the
busings which belongs to us as the Senate of the
United States.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas, I confess that
I am astonished at my friend from Mississippi.
It may be a fever that*has been growing on him
for some time; but he ha a certainly a very high
and excited fever upon him now upon the subject
of public business. There is an amount of indus-
try concentrated m him now that I have never
known^ot into the whole State of Mississippi be-
fore. [Laughter.] I have served with him on the
floor of the other £~louse, and in tins body, alto
grther for twelve years, and he was an experi-
enced man when I first knew him m the other
House. [Laughter.]
Mr. BROWN. I am not as old as that.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Aikansp*. I never did
know a time until within the last year or two,
when he commenced spun mg on for the purpose
of cutting the public business tian«aotod: und )
assure lum tk U I never have known a pound
when it seemed to pi ogress so iud:?ThreMly as it
does at the present time, and hence hi* >,mrring
has all bten of no avail. [L.ughtei.] I hop: v.*e
may have the qiusnon on postponing Cali-
fc/n.a iwJ.rcr.ul bill oe'yfortwo minutes
Mr. HAMLIN. The quotum whndi pot
a few minutes since and w gut' vei!, 1 inclined
to believe wns not a direct vole on th> epnaPon
of adjourning ovu\ and 1 am dnspov.d to think
tieittljeie &re som ' ^einitn.-^ who so moth

the effect of which will be to call r.-s Le;e > '-Dion

whether we want to come here Io-mone\v o;- • <_.%
and I think we can test the qu?stion in that v. ay.

Mi. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. I sh";nd hi£"
to a^-1: the iSenatoi a qivstion; tlirt is, v/ba iher or
not it is the understanding that if a niajorny are
thsfoseu not to aujouin ovar to-morrow, w< shcnl

Mr JOHNSON, of Arkansas. Of course that

! So the Senate refused to adjourn.
! Mr. JOTIN£GN, of Arkansas. I now move to
postpone the further consideration of the Pacific
i railroad bill u>uil to-morrow, with a view to make
| a motion to adjourn over.
i Mr. COLLAMER. A few moments since it
j was announced that the last vote was to be a test
1 vot •; that all who voted in ihvorof adjournment,
i did so v. iih a view to come heie to-moirow to go
| to work; and that those who voted against it, it
ote for proper measures to
ue has been
lemon have an-
nounced that they did not "vote on that ground.
Then this has been no issue at all. Now I wish
to inquire whothera motion that when we ad-
joum, we adjourn fill Monday, is one of those de-
batable questions which can bo objected to and he
ovet r It is not a motion to adjourn, and the Chair
dccidcJ this rnornins: that that was so. Amotion
to adjourn till Monday, I lake it, will not be in
order, because that is contrary to the rule. The
rule is to adjourn from day to day. A resolution
mav be passed that when we j.djourn it be to
M onday; but that is a change of the rude pro icinlo^
and is subject to objectem, and muse ho over it
it bo objected to. Such f understand^ to be the
decision of the Chan*, and the rule. Zsow \ wish
merely to say, Mr. P;  suV-nt, that the ^entieinan
from Ark-nisn1; v;j11 not i lieci his purpose if that
be so, and th.it I understand to be tne rule. It
that be the u>;e, I nhail e< rt n>dy object to u ;y
motion to jujourn over untd Monday, ft theie-
fore rau^t lie over, and the object cannot be
effected m that mnnnor. 1 do it'm nil eonseam-
tiousness. I believe the condition of the public
business is such that we ou^ln to work to-mor-
row.

be not so, the Senate has not the control of its
own action*, because9 by'taking advantage of a
privileged motion to adjourn, the Senate may be
forced to a conclusion ogmnst its will.
Mr. MASON. I desire only to say, with great
deference to the Chair, thai I think the Chair mis-
conceives the ruling of the Vice President, and I
agree entirely with what fell from the Senator from
New Hampshire. Ho ruled that only during the
morning hour tho motion could not be put; and
he ruled further, that it could not be put when a
question was pending, and no more, according to
my recollection.
Mr. SIMMOXS, We were in precisely the
position now that wc wore when the Chair ruled
this morning that this motion could not be enter-
tained; because there is a motion now pending—
an amendment to tho Pacific railroad bill.
The PRESIDING- OFFiQ£It. Will the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island allow the Chair, for the
information of the Senate, to ask the Secretary to
j read the 11th rule of the Senate ? ,
i The Secretary read it as follows:
j "It. Whfjn nqi^'-non ih umlci ilen^u-, !t(> motion be
' received bur to adjourn, to he on liie t.ihlu.to postpone m-
] definitely, to pompom; to a eeitam day. to commit, or to

! bate."
Mr. SIMMONS. That is precisely as I sup-
posed.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair un-
deiH'amdh the Senator from Arkansas to appeal
from the decision of the Chdir, that a motion to
adjourn fiom to-day until Monday is not in order
wh'ile there is other business pending before the
Senate.
Mr. JOMNSON. of Arkansas. Yes, sir.
i Mr. .MASON. YAH the Chair indulge me a
1 moment ?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Certainly.
! Mr. MASON. I underst-md the motion last
made by the Senator from Arkansas was a mo-
; turn to pjj^tjjone the bill under consideration until
! to-morrow.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair begs
| pardon. The Senator Inis j.oosented his original
■ motion to adjourn until Alomiay, and the Chair
I has decided it out of ouh w

i Senate that the S'uaie shall a.ijoiuu iiom day to
