(Received 9th.)

Major T. T. ECKERT,

Washington, D. C. ;

I arrived here this evening. Find that all dispatches were burned here by order of rebel officers. May find some at Charlotte or Columbia. I learn that paroled rebels have been pillaging and committing outrages against citizens of Augusta, and hope General Wilson will be ordered to send a force and occupy the place at once. The paroled thieves are continually passing down.

BULLOCK.
