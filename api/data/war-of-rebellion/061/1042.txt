Numbers 1. Report of Major General Frederick Steele, U. S. Army, commanding Department of Arkansas.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, June 28, 1864.

GENERAL: The rebels are not threatening Missouri. Shelby, joined by McCray, surprised gun-boat Numbers 26 and captured it at Clarendon 3 a. m. on the 24th instant. Captain Bache, with the Tyler and another gun-boat from Devall's Bluff, attacked Shelby, and in half an hour drove him back, recapturing the guns, ammunition, wounded men, clothing, &amp;c. I sent General Carr, with something over 3,000 infantry and cavalry and a battery, in pursuit of Shelby. He landed his command at Clarendon without interruption, and came upon the rebel pickets soon. The last heard from Carr, on the 25th, p. m., he was skirmishing with the enemy, having lost 12 men wounded. Shelby had two 12-pounder smooth-bore and two 10-pounder rifled guns. His force had not been fully developed. I proposed in due time to A. J. Smith and Washburn to co-operate with me against Shelby on the north side of White River, but they declined, for reasons stated. We could have captured his entire force. By sending a force in behind him from Augusta, hi might now be cut off, but I am threatened by a large force in front, and cannot weaken the line of the Arkansas any further with safety. Information derived from various sources makes it almost certain that the enemy is making a forward movement in large force. It is reported that Kirby Smith as advancing with from 35,000 to 40,000 troops to attack Little
