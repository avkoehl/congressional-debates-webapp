,ind from its source directly north to the aforesaul
highlands, v huh dnide the rners that fall into the
Mantic ocean iroin those which fall into the river
St Lawience " The highlands mentioned in both
pai ts of the description of boundaries are therefore
the imnc nn 1 sot different, and, to satisfy the do-

Extract from Mr. Holland's r epor t
"July 26, 1787 —Pursuant to orders, proceeded
to Gieat Falls, on the river St   Johns, and on the
16th met Capt Sproul, Surveyor General of New
Brunswick, who said  that, conceiving his waiting
for us at the Great Falls totally unnecessary, he
was now proceeding on his way to the height of land
or the carrying place between St. Lawrence and Lake
Timisconta, as there (accoidmgto his idea) the boun-
dary ought to be fixed     I observed, it was gene-
rally understood in Canada, that the line between
the provinces  of Quebec   and New Brunswick
should run/)oi  the head of Clutlem bay along the
highlands in a westerly direction to the Great Falls
on the St  Johns river, and fiom thence west to
the westernmost or mam brmch of the river St
Croix     He  answered  thit,  should a boundary be
fixed at or   near  the  Gr eat Falls, he would protest
jgamst such doings as contrary to directions laid
down m Ins instiuclwns    Afteiwards, Capt  Sproul
repeated  the same to Mt   Finlay, adding (hat he
would proceed immediately to the portage,  to exa-
mine which way the Haters incline on the heights thete,
that, fti; then course, he might ascertain the boundary
belwecn ihi provinces of Quebec and New BiunSwick,
as all  the streams running into the livers which
empty themselves into the river St Johns are m
the province of New Brunswick, and those which
fall into the St   Lawrence are in the province of
duebec     After many arguments to  show the im-
propriety and disadvantage of fixing aboundary on, the
portage, &e but more especially that the fixing that
limit would mater tally affect tht  boundary between us
and the United Slates of Jlmenea, and that a large
territory would thereby be saved oi   lost to his Ma-
jesty's dominions, &c and requested Mi  Sproul to
return with ns to the Great Falls     lie  refused,
sayingth.it he had foimed his opinion ot  the stlua-
¿ion. of the boundary from  geogi aphical knowledge
and ocular demonstr alion ind it wi>,unallcrablc, &c "
The wntten instructions from  the Governor of
New Bi unstuck to Spioul, dated  7th July, 1787,
were to r un i'if boundar y line between the provinces
ol   Ctuebic and Ntvv Bi unstuck agreeably to tin act
of Parhanunt for establishing the provincc of Quebec
Exit act fiom   the  ri¡)ort   of the   Commissioner  of
Council of the province of Quebec, appointed to con-
sider   the boundary between the provinces of Qucbce
and Alao Brunsuich, $,c   Oct  18,1787
"The Commissioner most humbly submits to jour
Lordship whether it would not be for the advantage
of both  Governments  that the province of Gluebec
be separated from   thai  of New Brunswick by a
line running along the highlands, which extend from
the head of Chaleurs bay to the foot of the great fall of
Si   Johns ruer, and from thence crossing the river
(so as to include the whole of ihe portage or car-
rying place) and continuing in a straight line toward
the sources if the river Chaudeur, which rise on the
highlands that commence at the said head of the Bay
of Chaleurs, arul extend all the way to the northwest
ernmost head if Connecticut river "
Extract from the arguments of the Bidi'h went, m
1797, before the Commissioners under the 50i arh
ele of the treaty of 179 1
"Ifitcanbe shown tint the river Scoudiac, so
called by the Indians, ?- this river St Crow, and
that a line along the middle of it to its source, to-
gether with aline due north from its sour ce, formed a
part of the uestem boundary of the province of Nova
Scoiia, and that the highlands formed the northern
boundary line of this piovince at the time the treaty of
peace was made, so as to form the northwest angle of
Nova Scotia, by these western and northern boun-
danes, the intention of the treaty of peace is at
once ascei tamed in the gieat point m contiover*y
"But to apply these facts to the point more im-
mediately under consideiation, whether a line due
' north from the source of the Western oi mam
branch of the river Scoudiac, or St Croix, will
leave to each of the pmies to the treaty those
rivers that empty themselves, or whose moulhs are,
withmrts territories, upon the sea coast respectively
"The effect, so far as regatd the United States,
is completely secured by the treat}, m all events,
and thence we have further reason to suppose it
w as  intended to be reciporcal in this respect, if a
just interpretation will warrant it. A line due
north from the source of the western or mam branch
of the Scoudiac, or St Croix, will fully secure this
effect to the United States in every instance; and
also to Great Britain m all instances except m that
of the river St Johns, wherein it becomes impossible,
by reason that the source of this river is to the west-
ward, not only of the western boundary line of
Nova Scotia, but of the sources of the Penobscot,
and even of the Kennebec, so that this north hne
must, of necessity, cross tlie river St Johns; but it wilt
cross it in a part of it almost at the foot of the high-
land', and where it ceases to be navigable. But, li-
the north line is traced from the source of the
Cheputnaticook, it will not 'only cross the river St
John within about 50 miles of Fredenckton, the
metropolis of New Brunswick, but tottí cut off the
sources of the rivers which fall into the bay of Chaleurs,
if not oi many olheis," &c.
Extract from a letter of Robert Listón, his Majesty's
Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States, to
War d Chapman, e<q agent of the British Govern-
ment in 1798.
"I have considered, with attention, your letter of
this date, and it appears to me evident that the
atloption of the river Cheputnaticook, as part of
the boundary between his Majesty's American
dominions and those of the United States, m pre-
ference to a line drawn from the easternmost point
of the Scodiac lakes, would be attended with con-
siderable advantage It would give an addition of
territory to New Brunswick, together with a greater
extent of navigation on St Johns river," Sec-
It thus appears that when the two Governments
were contending with each other as to the true St
Croix, or place from which the due north line was to
be run, it was well understood and admitted that
such due noith line would cross the river St. Johns,
and (hat the highlands of the treaty were north of
that river If Marr's Hill (now claimed by the
British Government as the highlands of the treaty,
and which is fai south of the river St Johns,) had
been then supposed or claimed to be the highlands,
at which the due north line was to stop, why the
zeal and effort of the British agent to fix the start-
ing point (the source of the St Croix) so far west
as that the line, running due north fiom it, should
not cross the St Johns near Fredenckton, but so far
up that river as to be beyond where it was navigable
and near to the highlands'! Or why should Mr Lis-
tón, the Butish Minister, write to their agent foi
managing the question before the commissioners,
that, by adopting the course suggested, it would
give to New Brunswick a greater extent of naviga-
tion on the St Johns'*
Again at the making of the treaty of Ghent in
1814, it is manifest that the British Government
made no pretension that the highlands were south
of the St Johns, or that any portion of the territory
now denominated disputed territory belonged to
that Government The idea that the St. Johns
river was not an Atlantic river, that the highlands
of the treaty were south ot the St Johns, or that
the line of boundary was so imperfectly described
in the treaty that it was impossible to find and
locate it, was not then entertained Hence we
fina that, on that occasion, the British commission-
ers first propose "such a variation of the lire of
frontier as may secure a direct communication be-
tween Gluebec and Halifax " On being informed
that the American commissioners had not autho-
rity to cede an} territory, the British commissioners
say that they were not prepared to anticipate the
objections stated by the American commissioners
that they had no authority to cede territory, how-
ever insignificant, although Ihe proposal left it open
to them to deman 1 an equivalent for such cession,
in frontier or otherwise , and further add, that
"they are pursuaded that an arrangement on this
point might be easny made, if entered into with a
spirit of conciliation, without any prejudice to the in-
terests of the district in question, [viz the now State of
Maine,] and Col Bouchette, Surveyor General of
Lower Canada, in his Topographical description
of the province of Lower Canada, printed in Lon-
don in 1815, says "The mam ridge, continuing its
norlheasterly direction, is intersected by an imagi-
nary ¡me, prolonged m a course astronomically due
north from the head of th  river St. Croix, and
