not heard from him since Sunday evening, but feel no uneasiness on his account. We overhauled a drove of hogs yesterday below Trenton, but found that they were driven under permit from Colonel Foster for the use of two loyal families near there. There are large numbers of fat hogs inn the counties below, and certain suspicious movements indicate a purpose to drive them to Tennessee. I will watch them closely. I have advices from Clarksville to 11 o'clock yesterday. No enemy there or in vicinity.

Very respectfully, yours,

S. D. BRUCE,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
