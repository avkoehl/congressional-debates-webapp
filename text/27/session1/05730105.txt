Public Lands—Mr, McKeon
H. ot Reps
expenses oí surveys and sales, and talks loud about
the money being lost by the faithlessness of Pnce,
Swartwout, and other defaulters. Much money,
Mr Chairman, may have been lost m this wa>, but
I must confess that this is the first time that I ever
heard that Swartwout was in. any way connected
with the public lands' [A laugh ]
The gentleman from Michigan complains that
these public lands should have been a burden, ra-
ther than a source of revenue to the General Go-
vernment. Why, sir, I thought it had been the
policy of this Government to sell those lands low,
 o as to make it easy for the pioneer of the West to
become a freeman, by being the owner of a suffi
went amoait of the soil, upon which he could
honestly raise up his growing family, rather lhan
to mal e them a source of revenue Yes, sir, it is
the true policy of this Government to hold out to the
honest poor of the old States inducements to emi
grate to the Western world, aiidthere become the pro
pnetors of the soil m the vast regions of uncultivated
wilderness m the valley of the Mississippi And
the consequence of this policy has been to make
the "wilderness blossom a-- the rose " And where
is the man who wou'd now change tbi  policy' I
see, Mr Chairman, m the bill upon your tabb , a
feature which, m the consequences necessarily re-
sulting from it, will change the old sys-
tem of policy in regard to the public lands
You propose to make the proceeds of the sales of
these lands a permanent fund for distribution
amongst the States What, will follow? Why,
sir, it will be soon discovered that this fund, at $1 25
per acre, will be too small, and at that price, too
soon exhausted You will then raise the pnce
to $2 00, from that to three, four, and five dollars
per acre1 This wi 1 be the result of this me~su'e,
and the consequence will be, that vast tracts rf our
Western *oil will be kept unsettled and unsold for
half a century, for the double purpose of keeping a
fund for distribution, and to retard Ihegrovthof
the West. Have gentlemen viewed well the conse-
quences which will flow from this measurs? I
have stated, Mr Chairman, some of the objections
I nave to the principles of the bill. And now for
its details
The first feature which presents itself for consi-
deration is the proposition to give to some of the
Western S'ates 10 per cent over and above tneir
equal proportion. What is this ¡eature intended to
produce? Is it a bribe offered to us of the West,
in order to make us take this measure, so obnoii
ous to our growth and prosperity? It it is intended
as a bribe, all I have to saj is, that I for one wnl
not accept it. No, -ir, I spurn it The people of
Indiana once refused this measure, when the bribe
was laiger And will she now, when you are tak
mg advantage of her impoverished condilion, to
«educe her from her integrity, will ^he now bite
at the btafi No, sir, she «ill rather make you such
an answer as one of the distinguished patriots of
the Revolution made to one of the minions of the
British crown "We are poor indeed, but all your
wealth cannot buy us " Such, s r, is the answer I
will give, so long as I am permitted to retain a
seat upon this floor
Sir, if you had offered us this bonus when we
were out of debt, and, consequently, able to treat
with you as equal , we womd not have suspected
you with a design upon our virtue, and then we
could have 'topped to argue with you But when
you take advantage of our poverty and distress to
make these advances to as, we aie induced to sus-
pect you of an intention to practise upon our inte-
grity, and therefore we turn from >ou, and treat
you and your bribe with scorn and contempt
Another feature of the bill which seems to be
unjust, is that part of it which makes the dis nbu
tion according to the ratio of representaron on
this floor. The property representation recognised
by the Constitution, wpich places five slaves in the
South uponthe footing of three freemen in the North,
was given for representative purposes, and not for
distributive purposes Distributive purposes, did
I say? I do not know, sir, but the term is inapplica-
ble, for well do I know, that the framers'of that
instrument never, whilst they were engaged in the
great work of forming and perfecting that noble
charter ef human liberty, imagiaed that under it,
the Congre s of the United States would claim the
right to collect u.oney tor the purpose f uistu
buting it amongsi t ie Sta'es Such a power i« now
claimed, however, and if it is legitimately exer-
cised, why not make the distribution according io
lh  plan by which they authorized it* levy ^The
Constitution provides that representation and di-
rect taxa ion shall go üand in hand, which simply
means, that if nve slaves in the South shall be
equal to thiee freemen in the North, for representa-
tive purposes, that the five slave-, in the South
shall pay as much tax into the Treasury as ihe
three tieemen of the North But by the provisions
of this bill, iou reverse this just rule, and distri-
bute as much of the revenue ot the Government to
the five s'aves ot the South, as >ou do to the three
freemen of the North This, sir, is wrong in princi-
ple and unjust m practice, and doubly so, because
the whole measure is lounded in wrong and mjas
tice
There is one provision in this bill, Mr. Chair-
man, which I would most cheerfully support, if it
were not found in such bad company • I refer to
the tail of the bill, as it is called, which grant , to
the actual settler the right of pre enption The
tail, sir, I could take, if the head was < ut off1 But,
as a whole, I cannot swallow it The gentleman
from Georgia objects to this feature of the bul, and
complains bitterly that these settlers are suffered to
take ihe choice of ail ou> Western lands Well,
sir, in God's name, whom would he have to take the
first choice of the lands leclaimed froai the Wilder
ness, and from the possession of the =avage, and
made to partake of the na'ure of the garden of
Eden—beau lful for the eye to look uoon? Would
he disp issess the haitly pioneer, who has braved
all the hardships of a frontier life, who has settled
the West at ^ie imminent pel 1 of ns lifg and
to^t of his lamily, amidst the tomauawk*. of
the savage and tie diseases of a Western climate'!
Would he wrest mis land from those wor'hy
men, and confer it upon the speculators who reside
m your Kastern citie-., who never saw the West
until they made their trip to the land sale«, in or-
der to outbid aid dispossess the wortny tenants
of the wilderness? This, Mr Chairman, s not ihe
policy which a wise legi lator and an American
patriot would advocate But the gentleman seems
to be entirely ignorant of the true character of
tho f occupants of our Western soil He evident-
ly looks upon them as a kind of semi barbarians,
who are not entitled to the protection of this Go-
vernment Sir, thu is a m take These men
are of the best blood, and n< blest spirits in your
land They partake of the character of oui ml-
gnm fathers, who first settled the North American
continent—men, sir, who would not brook the
tyranny and insolence of their oppressors in the
mother country, who, by fortune or otherwise,
seemed to be their superiors—men who, m the West-
ern wilds, «ought and fonnd a ittreat from the
insolftnce and petty tyranny, which were practised
upon them Sacn, Mr Chairman, is the character
of those Western pioneers, whom it js my duty, as
wrll as pleasure, to defend upon ih s floor
I now tender to the committee my smceie thanks
for then kind indulgence, and take my seat
SPEECH OF MR. McKEON.
or Nrw \oitk
In the  House of Bepresentalivei, July 3, 1841—
The House being 11 Committee of the Whole
on  ihe state if the Union, and having under
consideration the bill to distribute the proceeds
of the sales oi the  sales  of the public lands
and to grant pre emption ng,ht
Mr McKEON remarked that on a question so
impor ant as that now under discussion hetould
not consent (o give a  silent vote    Every  day
brought to light new objec ions to the bill, and he
trusted that yet the dominant party in this House
would well consider tfte responsibility which rested
on them, and  the evil consequences which mi t
flow Horn the adoption of this measure    Some
tew years since I, (said Mr McK ) with my friend
from Virginia [Mr  Wise.] and fon>-three other ,
stood in this House voting against ihe distribution
of millions of surplus *hen m your Treasury.
We then raised our warning voices against this
pernicious policy of distnbation. Our warnings
were unheeded We told the friends of that mea-
ure, that to distribute ihe public fund was not the
act of wise statesmen—that the time would come
when the revenues of the nation would be dimi-
nished—that even if not diminished, the great na-
tional objects of defence, both naval and military,
demanded some share of the public moneys. This
very fui d, arming from the sales of the public
lands, had, in 1836, increased enormously, but
even then some on this floor insisted that it could
not be expected to continue in its superabundant
flow
"Whence do we derive our revenue? Chiefly
from the sale of the public lands and customs The
amount derived from the late sales of the public
domain has been entirely unprecedented On re-
ference to the cales which have been made for the
hst wenty years, it will be seen that the amount
received during the last year fat outstrips by many
millions any single year of thit period There
have been points of time at which great sales have
been made, but, nevertheless, the last year is im-
mensely be} ond them We have seen the receipts
of 1834, amounting to upwards of four millions,
suddenly rising, m 1835, to near fifteen millions.
Can this stale of things continue"* Have we not
reason to suppose that these purchases are entirely
in alvance of the natural increase of population—
m advance of emigration into the new sections of the
country? Have we not a right to calculate that
the spirit of speculation to which we may attribute
this demand, will soon have lost its vigor and ex-
pended its influence'' The Sate returns show a
falling off"
This was one of the prophetic warnings some of us
gave ihe members of this House, and I legret that
<ui prophecie have been fulfilled Again, then, I
call upon the friends of this bill to pause in their
dangerous career I conjure them to look at the
situation of the Treasuiy, and answer me whether
they c<-.n, with any propriety, force this measure on
the country
What is the situation of the country? We are
here in obedience to the proclamation of the late
Executive of ihe Umsn—-a proclamation which in-
formed the people of this country that the Treasu-
rj of the Union was in. an embarrassed condition,
so that it was necessary to convene in an extraor-
dinary sessicn «¡t Congress of the United States
I do not s ate the case too stro gly when I assert,
m the language of the prominent friends of the Ad-
ministration, that a suffering people demanded re-
lief at the hands of their representatives I am
here to execute the behests of those entrusted with
the management of public affairs What remedy
has been proposed to a people "sick even unto
death'' What relief has been suggested for the
benefit e f this nation in the agony of pecuniary
di ties--? Can it be credited that the first measure
of relief is a propo mon for taxation—for the plun-
der of the public domain—for the purpose of emp-
tying the Treasurj? Wh), it is already empty.
This Congress has been convened to fill a bank-
¡upt Treasury, and we commence operations by
giving away the public property The bill now
before us proposes io divide the revenue derived
from the sales of public lands amongst the several
¡states
On my return to my constituents, should I
vote against this bill, it might be inquired
of me whj I dared to oppose a mea-
sure wh oh, according to Us supporters, pro-
mised so ^reat benefits to the States It held
out 'o all of them rehaf from the heavy burden of
the State debts which oppressed so many. It af-
forded to those not indebted the means of extend-
ing tneir lines of intercommunication by railroads
and cariáis, and the blessings of education In my
view the General Government has no right, direct-
ly nor induectly, to as ume the debts of the States
—to foster internal local improvement—to inter-
fere with the domestic arrangements of the States
L°t ihis pelicy be carried out, and you have at once
a consolidated Government in all ns magnificence,
and with all us despotic power, using amongst us.
The bill, on lis face, enacts that the moneys re-
ceived by ih« States under this bill shall be expend-
