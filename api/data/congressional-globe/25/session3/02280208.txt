THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 26.
Marion county, Ohio, who memorialize the Sen
ate and House of Repiesentatives of the United
States of Ameiioa in Congress assembled, to take
mío consideration the condition of the descend-
ants of Africa who are now groaning under the
galling yoke of slavery     They ask Congress to
use their utmost influence, m a peaceful mannei,
as a council desiring the welfaie of all its sub-
jects, for the deliveianee of the African race, that
they may enjoy, under our Govei nment, the i igh ts
and privileges of fiee men     The  memorialists
state that they have viewed, and deeply lamented,
the system of slavery as practiced in this nation,
believing it to be entirely at variance with the
Christian rehgioi, which was laid on the table
Also, a petition signed by sixty five females and
fifty-six males, from the same section of Ohio
They state that they have viewed, deplored, and
deeply lamented, the condition of the abongmes
of our country, which they believe calls loudly
upon every Christian and plulanthiopist to inter  i
cede in their behalf, believing, as they do, that |
they are, and have been, a most mjuied people,
driven from their homes, possessions, and  the j
graves of their fathers, to seek an unknown and
unmolested refuge, and that they were the original
owners of the soil we now possess     lhertfoie, '
they desire of Congress, in then legislative capa
city, to extend the hand of mercy to this people,
by permitting them to enjoy, peaceably, the small ¡
remnants of their possessions which they now j
occupy, and like a kind fatlici to e\ti nd the aim 'I
of protection over the íesidue of this pe>plc,tliat
the blessing of Heaven may rist upon us   which
