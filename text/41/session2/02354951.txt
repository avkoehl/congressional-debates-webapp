mon to townships twelve and thirteen north,
ranges twenty-six and twenty-seven west,thence
Â«outh with said range line to the corner common
to townships nine and ten north, thence west
on the line between said townships to the west-
ern boundary ofthe State; the lands lying north
of said division line within the limits of the
said Clarksville district to besubject to disposal
at Huntsville, Arkansas, and the lands lying
south of said division line within said district
to be subject to disposal at Dardanelle, Arkan-
sas, the same to bo known and designated as
the Huntsville and Dardanelle land districts.

required to reside at the site of their respective
offices, shall be subject to the same laws and
responsibilities, and whose compensation and
fees shall be respectively the same per annum
as are now allowed by law to other land dis-
tricts in said State.
