ment of the condition of the business of the
Committee on Banking and Currency.

gentleman wish?
Mr. JUDD. Five minutes.
There was no objection; and it was ordered

Mr. JUDD. Mr. Speaker, the Committee
on Banking and Currency was called for reports
the last time on the 7th of May, 1868. It has
not been called at this session, and in the pres-
ent condition of the public business it is appar-
ent that it will not be called during the present
session. I am directed by the committee to
state to the House the subject-matters on which
the committee are now ready to report, and to
ask the House to fix some time consistent with
their views of the importance of these matters
and the condition of the business of the House
at which the committee could occupy the floor
for the purpose of making those reports.
The committee have had under consideration
propositions, very many of which' have been
recommended for legislative action by the
Comptroller of the Currency, and which he
thinks are necessary in the administration of
the laws in relation to the national banks.
The committee is prepared to report cm the
following: a bill in reference to the certification
of checks by the banks without having the
funds which said checks represent; also on the
question of banks paying interest on deposits.
We are likewise prepared to report on the ques-
tion of the national banks loaning money on
United States and national bank notes and
collateral securities; also on the bill for the
conversion of gold into currency, and ror other
purposes. We are prepared to report oa the
proposition to regulate' the time and manner
of compelling national banks to make their
reports.
I will say to the House that we have consid-
ered and are prepared to report on the question
of the equalization and redistribution of the
national bank currency to the different parts
of the country. We are also prepared to re-
port upon the Senate bill which regulates the
duties of receivers and the mode of closing up
the business of banks which have suspended.
Mr. Speake'r, in view of these important
public questions, upon which the committee
have acted and are ready to present bills for
the action of the House, they have instructed
me to move that the morning hour of Satur-
day next shall be sot apart for the purpose of
receiving those reports and acting upon the
same.
There was no objection 5 and it was ordered
accordingly,
