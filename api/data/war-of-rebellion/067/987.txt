COLONEL: I have the honor to report that on the 19th instant at 5.30 p.m. my outpost, on the road leading from Alsop's to Silver's, on the plank road, was driven in and attacked by a strong force, consisting, as far as I was able to judge, of cavalry and artillery, and seemed to be determined to penetrate my lines. The Second Ohio Cavalry was ordered to engage the enemy until I could bring infantry supports. At the same time heard heavy firing of musketry and artillery on our left and rear. I immediately formed my division in line. Had a slight skirmish with the enemy, but night setting in, the firing ceased. Advancing a short distance I found that the enemy had retreated. We captured 5 prisoners belonging to Ewell's corps. Our losses were very small.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
