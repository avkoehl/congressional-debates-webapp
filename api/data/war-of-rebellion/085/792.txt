WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 11, 1864.

Captain McNUTT,

Ordnance Officer, Leavenworth:

You will issue arms and ammunition, as required, upon the requisition of Major-General Curtis, and notify the Chief of Ordnance by telegraph promptly what requisitions and issues are made, also what supplies, if any, are running short, so that they may be speedily replenished.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SAINT LOUIS, October 11, 1864-10.45 a. m.

Major-General CURTIS,

Leavenworth:

Price did not take Jefferson City. He declined the offer and moved west and north last night. He took Boonville and is moving on Lexington with all possible dispatch. Sanborn with all our cavalry is pursuing him with all possible dispatch. Look out for him at the rate of thirty miles daily - 15,000 mounted men, nineteen pieces of artillery.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 11, 1864.

Governor T. CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

General Rosecrans reports that Price left Jefferson City last night without taking that place, going to Lexington at the rate of thirty-three miles a day with 15,000 mounted men and nineteen pieces of artillery. I concur with General Deitzler in hurrying troops forward to Olathe. I am going forward soon. Have telegraphic line again open to Warrensburg, Mo. Only bushwhackers in region of Independence.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 11, 1864-11.45 p. m.

THOMAS CARNEY,

Governor of Kansas, Leavenworth City:

Price is crossing some of his force to the north of the river. You must prepare for him in any event. A thousand good frontiersmen, mounted, will be invaluable. Don't wait for him to attack you. Report says he is not moving with much rapidity. This to-day; yesterday as then telegraphed.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

LAWRENCE, October 11, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Please send Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, Sixteenth [Kansas Cavalry], to command this post. Have you any orders for me?

J. H. LANE.
