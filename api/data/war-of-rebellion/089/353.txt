FORT BRADY, VA., October 25, 1864.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the rebel fire at the canal was confined to about two hours in the middle of the day. No one injured as I could see or hear. Returned their fire with the 4.5-inch gun; killed a single man while crossing the field leaving the battery. Have moved all my men from the Gap, excepting enough to work one piece and the magazines. Shall bring the mortars away early to-morrow morning. Sent the light pieces this p.m. Put my last recruits on detachment to-day; they work splendidly; almost like old men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
