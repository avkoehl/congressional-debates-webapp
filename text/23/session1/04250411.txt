meut by Mr   CHAMBLRS, that "the Sei retary

gested, theiefore, mordei to attain the end desired,
to change the mode of arnving at it, by making it
the duty of a commit ee to make the investiga ion

would not meet I is views He wished the infor-
mation in detail, so that it might be punted and
sent to eveiy county in the United States, for
public investigation.

The resolutioi hav ng been íeau as modified by
Mi Poo-*, fixing the ICth of June as the day of
adjourn nent—
Mr   POLK was  sa isfied  thit the day of ad
journ ne it of the two Houses of Congress ought
to be fixed at the ear'iest day compatiole with the
mipjrtur t public business which lemamed undis
po_ed of     He was apprehensive that the IGch of
June was   >o eaily     When this suoject was he-
lor  the House a foitnight ago, he had \o ed to
postpone its consiJeruion for two weeks, with the
hope timt the House would, in the mem  time,
have disposed of much of the most pressing busi   M
less, and that, by this time, a more defiiite and
correct opinion irn^ht be io med as to tne pioper   J
time to ei d the session     The fortnight had passed '
off, and scarcely any business had been disposed   j
ot     ihe only bi'l, of general ¡mpo-tance, which   j
had been passed, was   he coin bill     He was sat
< Sel tnit while the subject was ke¡ t open, the
He use v.01  d no' pioceed ip the despatch of the
necessaiy measuies with that mdusti y ai d earn
estness win n they would do if the day should be
fixed     There weie three important appiopnat on
bills not ye   passed, the It d e>n annuity bill and
the hdiboi   bill weie be'u.e tne House upon then
engrossment, ard tl e '"oruficition bill had i ot yet
been lepoitcd tiom the Committee of the Whole
on the state c t the Union     It was his intention, at
tl e earliest pos"ible period   1i ask the  House to
go into the cons dei ttion oi the bi'l reported fiom
the Committee of Ways and Means regulating the
deposites of the public money     Witn these im
poitant measures befoie the. House, and the elec-
tion fiom Kentucky undisposed of, hetnougnt the
House could not safel} fix upon so early a p^rnd
of adjournment as the 16 h of June     Pie would
suggest to tne mover of the resolution the propn-
ety of piolonging the time for a foitnight—to hx
upon the JÜ I  ot June instead of the 16 h
Mi BOON" said he had already prolonged the
time from the 31st M ly to the lb h June, and 1 e
would now leave it in possession of the House if
an} gen leman prefeired a longei day, he might
propose to modify the íesolution by ame"du ent
M ELLSWORTH entirely concmred with
the gentleman fiom Indiana, [\lr Boov ] He
was anxious to fK upon the earliest possible diy   I
which would be satisfactory to the House He
was satisfied that the eai lei the day was the bettei.
There weie suojects of paramount importance,
upon which he had hoped the House would act;
but he was convinced they wo'uld not be acted on
The indispensable business of the House could be
settled withm the shortest period He was for
fixing on that period He had hoped that the
House would have expressed its op nion, as waa
its bounden duty, uoon the reasoi ¡s for removing
the deposites from the United States Bank The
House was called on by the President, by the
Secretary of the Treasury, by the Bank, by the
Constitution, and by the whole countiy, to express
this opmon He had also hoped that the House
would have fixed upon some regulation respecting
the deposite of the public money There was
anotl er sul jeet of gieat impoitance which he h¡>d
hoped to have seen settled the disposal of ihe
public domain But he was convinced that noth-
ing effectual would be done on any of these great
questions, and was wilnng to vote for the earliest
day of adjournment, if it was out ten days hence
We might as well go home then, as to stay until
September
Mr HARDIN wished to substitute the 30 h
Tune for the 16th The House dwed it to them-
selves, as well as to the nation, to dispose of the
measures mentioned by the gentleman from Ten-
nessee, [Mi Poll.,] inadd'tionto other indispen-
sable measures Thegentleman fiom Connecticut
[Mi EiLsworm] states it to be the duty of the
House to expre sits opinion upon the measures of
the Adr-unistiation leíame to the bank, and toart
upon the great question of the natioi al domain,
and yet desires to adjourn in a fortnight from th's
time Was that gentleman efiaid of the dos; days ?
Toi one, he was willing, if it was necessary, to
wait and see if the dog star would become ascend-
ant in the House If we adjouri ed at the time
advocated by that gentleman, how many days of
business should wt have at olir disposal? We
have the nppropuation bills, and the bill legulatirg
the deposites, refeiled to by the gentleman flora
Tennessee, [Mr Polk,] and we also have the
report of the co nn utee of investigation in o the
afiaiis of the bank, which would not, piobably, be
di posed of in a single day He should be glad
to have the benefit of the views and calculations of
the mover of tl is resolution as to the time neces-
saiy to dispose of these important measures in
that case he might change Ins opinion, but acting
upon the best means of infornation m his powei,
he was satisfied that the House ought not to ad-
journ short of four weeks from this time Gentle-
men should .ecollect that these measures must be
acted on by the Senate He was unwilling o throw
the whole respon lbility of fixing the period of
ad]ou~nment upon t'-at body
Mi BE4RDSLCY said the House had been
assured, wnen th t> suij°ctv/as be ore them a foit-
night ago, tnat at this time we should be able to
fix uoon a suitable period of adjournnent Have
we in/ further ligh' than v e then had' Has
an j thing 11 effect been d ne «mce that time 11 ac
complis ni g the necessary business of the session '
We have, to be sure, ipused the caipets to be
take i u t, "xi d mjtting subot tuted on the floor of
this Hall Some gentlemen had been to Hamper's
I en v, otheis to Vnginia, and others have a'tend-
ed the Butimore races but no impoitan' publ.c
basi less had I een done, and he was satisfied that
nnti1 the day of adjournnen' should be fixed, veiy
httle would be done in fixin-1' that day, the oniy
question in his view was, what t me is necessary to
dispose of the business intended to be tiansacted
by the House? We could not undertake to ottlt
anv. such question f n the Seno e That body
can uest judge of us own duties 1 ney con change
'lie day wh eh may be fixed oi by the Hou^e
'o one more agreeable to themselves rLhe sole
qiestion befo e thp Ilous  i , how much time is
indispensable io dischaige us necessaiy dutie=?
If the time should be wasted as it has been,
neither the ]G n nor he 30 h of June would find
much busn ess accomplished But if gentlemen
were disposed to attend strictly to the business of
tie House, net more than thieeor foui days were
necessary to dispose of the appropriation bills
\s to the Kentucky election, if the i > ididrtes
should state their views of their respective r gilts,
and t! e ilouse would come up to the u ail , th-it
