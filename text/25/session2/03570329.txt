The SPEAKER decided that the question had
been settled four years ago , that no member could
be called upon to vote upon a papar which had not
been read
The Clerk having been directed to proceed,
read as follows
The Committee appointed to mvestgaie the causes which
led to the death of the Hon Jonathan CUley, late a
member of the House of Representatives, and the cir-
cumstances connected therewith, qpd to inquire
whether there has been, m the case alluded to, a breach
of the privileges of the House, and to whom viae ie-
ferred smxiixi memorials upon the subject, now ash
leave to submit their _
REPORT
In discharging the trust committed to them by
the House of Representatives, the committee have
endeavoied implicitly to obey its order, neither
stopping short, on the one hand, of the full mea-
sure of the duty imposed upon them, nor transcend-
ing its just limits on the other. They were of the
opinion tnat the investigation was instituted solely
for the mimtenance of the privileges of the House
It was not within the province of the House of Re-
presentatives to investigate the causes which led to
the death of one of its members, or the circum-
stances which attended it, with a view to the pun-
ishment of any offender for a high crime or misde-
meanor That belongs, m every case, exclusively
to the courts of law Senators and Representatives
are not privileged from arrest in cases of " treason,
felony, and breach of the peace," and it is a con-
stitutional provision, that "m all cnrninal prosecu-
tions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial, by an impaitial jury of the Slate
and district wherein the crime shall have been com-
mitted, which district shall have been pre\ louslj as-
certained by law, and to be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation, to be confronted by
the witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro
cess fer obtaining- witnesses m his favor, and to
have the assistance of counsel for his defence "
The inquiry, therefore, is directed to one object
onlj — the maintenance of the privileges of the
House, and the question is, what, in that view,
were the causes which led to the death of Mr Cil-
ley, and the circumstances connected therewith,
and did they involve a breach of those privileges?
In pursuing this investigation, the cemmittee
have examined all whose testimony, there was
reason to believe, might be material, and Messrs
Graves, Wise, and Jones, members of the House,
were permitted to attend, and to examine and cross-
examine the witnesses and the same leave was ex-
tended to Mr Menefee, of the House, and to Mr
Pierce, of the Senate, at then lequest The entire
mass of the testimony is now submitted as a pait
ot thisieporf One witness, Daniel Jackson, of
the city oí New York, who was summoned lo
attend, and called upon to testity, has neglected to
obey the requisition, though he appeared before the
committee, and mteirogatories were put to him,
but, from the position m which ho stood, and the
disclosures of anothei \\i ness, it was not thought
worth the time or a tendon of the House 01 < f he
committee to notice him further
The wte Jonathan Cilley, a member of the
House from Ihe State of Maine, fell by the hand of
William J Graves, a member of the House fiom
the State of Kentucky, in a duel fought with nfles,
near the boundary line between the District of
Columbia and the State of Maryland, on Saturday,
the 24th of February last
The causes which led to his death are intimately
connected with the proceedings of this House On
the ISth of February Mr Wi«e, ot Virginia, pre-
sented to the House a publication m the New York
Courier and Enqnner, charging a member of Con-
gress with corruption upon the authority of an
anonymous writer under the signature of "Ihe Spy
in Washington," and thereupon moved a resolu-
tion for the appointment of a select committee,
with power to send for persons and papers, to
inquire into the charge Mr Wise said "The
character of the authority upon which the charge
is made, is vouched for as respectable and authen-
tic by the editor of the Courier and Enquirer, in
whose paper it appears, and the House is called
upon to defend its honor and dignity against the
charge "
Mr Cilley addressed the House m opposition to
the resolution In the course of the debate he
said " he said he knew nothing of this editor but
if it was the same editor who had once made grave
charges^agamst an institution of this country, and
aftervvar3s was said to have received facilities to the
amount of some $52,000 from the same institution,
anf gave it his hearty support, he did not thinit his
charges were entitled to much credit m an Ameri-
can Congress " These words, spoken by Mr
CiUey m debate, \vere strictly in order, were perti-
nent to the subject under discussion, and "did not
exceed the bounds and limits of his place and
duty,' and though they implied a doubt inconsis-
tent with unblemished honor and character m
the person alluded io, jet Mr Cilky was justified
m the use of them, by a report of a committee of
the House of Representatives, appointed on the
I4th of March, 1832, to inspect the books and ex-
amine into the proceedings of the Bank of the
United States An extract from the report, made
by the majority of the committee, and published
by mder of the House of Representatives, is here-
unto annexed, in which it is staled, that " (or six-
teen months" the New York Courier and Enquner
" was warmly opposed" to the Bank of the United
States, that on the 26th of March, 1831, and with
in less than nine months thereafter, the bank made
three loans, amounting " to the sum of $52,975,
which consisted of notes drawn and endoised by
the editors only," and that " on or about the 8th
of April, 1831, it (the paper) changed its course
in favor of the bank "
It was m reference to the facts contained in this
report, and published to the world by order of the
House of Representatives, that Mr Cilley spoke
the words, v\ hich hid been already recited, and for
thus alluding to (acts put forth m the published
documents of the body of which he was a member,
he was called m question by the editor of the New
York Courier and Enquirer James Watson
Webb, on the 21st of February last, addressed a
note to him, recmng those words, apprizing him
that the writei of it was the edilor ol that paper,
and concluding with a demand of explanation,
couched in very explicit terms
Gadsby's Horn.!,
Washington, February 21, 1838
Sir In the Washington Globe of the 12th in-
stant, you are reported to have said, in the course
of the debate which took place in the House of Re-
presentatives on that day, growing out of a publi-
cation made m the New York Conner and En-
qutier—"He (you) knew nothing of this editor,
but if it was the same editoi who had once made
grave chaiges against an institution of this countiy,
and aflerwards was said to have received facilities
to ihe amount of some I^OOO from the same in-
stitution, and gave it his hearty suppoit, he did not
think his chaiges were entitled to much credit m an
American Congress "                               ^
I deem it my dnty to apprize you, sir, that. I am
the editor of the paper in which the letter from the
"Spy in Washington," charging a member ot Con-
gress with corruption, was first published, and the
object of this communication i^ to inquire of you
whether I am the edilor to whom you alluded,and,
it so, to ask the explanation which the character
of your remarks renders necessary
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
J   WATSON WEBB.
To the Hon. Jonathan Cili ey
Tins demand of explanation, undei the circum-
stances which existed, was not susceptible of mis-
interpretation, and, the sequel proves, was not mis-
understood Mr Graves was the bearer of this
note, having read it, and being fully apprized of its
contents, and tendered it to Mr. Cilley, m the hall
of the House of Representatives, whils the House
% as in session Mr Cilley declined to receive it,
and thereupon a-" brief correspondence ensued,
«Inch terminated ¡n the challenge and death of
Mr Cilley by the bearer of this note The fust
note of Mr Graves was delivered by himself to
Mr Cilley, on the same day on which he bore the
note of Webb, that is, on Wednesday, the 21st of
February, 1838, and should have borne that date
It is as follows
Hodse op Represen! atives,
February 20, 1838
In the interview which I had with j ou this morn-
ing, when you declined receding from me the note
of Colonel J W. Webb, asking whether you were
conectly reported m the Globe in what you are
there repiesented to have said of him in this
House, on the 12th instant, you will please say
whether you did not remark, in substance, that in
declining to receive the note, you hoped I would
not considei it, in any respect, disrespectful lo me,
and that the ground on which you rested your de-
clining to receive the note was distinctly this That
you could not consent to get youiselt into personal
difficulties with conductois ot public journals, foi
what you migh' think piopcr to sa} in debate upon
this floor, m discharge of your duties as a repie-
sen ative of the people, and that you did not lest
your objection, in our interview, upon any personal
objections to Colonel Webb as a gentleman
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
W J  GRAVES
Hon Jonathan Cillei
It will be observed that the note which Mr
Graves bore, is described by him as the note of
Colonel J W Webb, asking whethet Mi Cilley
was cot rectly repot ted m the Globe in what he was
tliei e represented to have said m the Home of Represen-
tatives, on the 12f& instant But it will be perceived
that the note itself, though it is thus described by
Mr Graves whenever he speaks of it afterward*,
does not contain that mquii y
Mr Cilley, on the same day, personally dehveted
to Mr Graves the following note m reply
House op Representatives,
February 21, 1838
The note which yon just placed in my hands has
been received In reply, I have to state that m
jour interv ew with me this morning, when yoa
proposed to delivei a communication from Colonel
Webb, of the New York Courier and Enquirer, I
declined to receive it, because I chose to be draw n
into no controversy with him I neither affirmed or
denied any thing in regard to his chaiaciei, but
when you remarked that this course on my part
might p'ace you in an unpleasant situation, I stated
to you, and now repeat, that I intended, by the re-
fusal, no disrespect to you
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

On Thursday, the daj following, Mr Graves sent
his second note to Mr Cilley, n kich was delivered
to him in his seat, during the session of the House,
by Mr Menefee, of Kentucky, the latter accompa
njmg its delivery with an expression of the hope
that Mr Cilley would perceu e the propriety of re-
lieving Mr Graves from a position which v. as pain-
ful to him Mr Cilley remarked that the note
should be attended to    It is as follows
House op Represi-ntatu fs
Februaiy 22, 1838
Sir Your note of yesterday, m reply to mine of
that date, is inexpl cit, unsatisfactory, and insuffi-
cient Among other things in this, that, in your
declining to receive Colonel Webb's communica-
tion, it does not disclaim any exception to him per-
sonally as a gentleman I have, therefoie, to in-
quire whether you declined lo receive Ins communica-
tion on the gtound of any personal exception to him as
a gentleman w a man of honor11 A categorical
answer is expected
Very respectfully,
WM  J   GRAVES
Hon J Cilley
Mr Cilley, on the same day, returned the follow-
ing reply, by Mr Duncan, ot Ohio
House or Representatives,
February 22, 1838
Sir Your note of this date has just been placed
in my hands I regret that mine of yesterday was
unsatisfactory to you but I cannot admit the right
on your pait to propound the question to which you
ask a categorical answer, and therefore decline any
further response to it
Very respeetfully,
Hon W Graves               TONA   CILLEY
