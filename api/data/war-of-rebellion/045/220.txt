For what regiment are the 700 horses you speak of intended? If for the Second [West] Virginia, that regiment may be left at Grafton, or Webster, until the equipments arrive, and in the meantime guard horses and stores.

Major General H. W. Halleck,

General-in-Chief:

The presence of two or three gunboats, or even one, here at Baltimore, would have a most wholesome, effect, internally and externally. Can you get for us immediately something of the kind?

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

Baltimore, June 19, 1863.

Major-General MILROY, Bedford, Pa.:

If you cannot be of immediate use to General Couch with that portion of your division which you have found at Bedford, get them in order, and return by Harrisburg immediately here, that you may take them to rejoin the forces at Harper's Ferry. General Tyler reports 1, 559 of your men with him. Reorganization must go on at once.

ROBT C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

Baltimore, June 19, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Major-General Halleck,

General-in Chief, Washington, D. C.:

By telegraph this moment from Harrisburg, I learn that Major-General Couch is directing General Milroy, and wishes me to give him no order without its passing through his headquarters. I had ordered General Milroy, when I sent him after his men in that department, to confer with or report to General Couch.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Baltimore, June 19, 1863.

Major-General MILROY, Bedford, Pa.:

Captain Power reports 300 of your men at New Creek. I have directed him to proceed at once, with all your officers and men that he can gather, to report to you at Bedford. Your command must be gotten together as soon as possible. Let me hear from you.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
