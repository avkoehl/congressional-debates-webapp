had in passing Tennessee money along the road
He had stopped at a t ivein in Kentucky, and when

told whn the bill would be m specie, and said he
could tell"« hat it would be m the notes of the Com-
monwealth Bank of Kentucky, which were consi-
derably below par, but he said that these Tennessee
  notes «ele neither one nor the other, and he coul 1
not tell what they -would be worth, and what the
bill would be m those notes Now he imagined
that this w ould be the way with the Treasury notes

would be worth-

The  House, at this stage, on  motion  of Mr
CAMBRELENG, passed to the orders of the day.
The SPEAKER laid before the House acommu-
nication from the Secretary of the Tieasury, 11
answer to certain resolves for all ordeis issued, and
correspondence with the several deposite banks, in
reference to the transfer of the payment of the seve-
ral instalments of deposite to the Slate Govern-

on motion of Mr BRIGGS, was ordered to he on
the table and be printed
ADJOURNMENT OP CONGRESS
The House then took up the joint resolution from
the Senate pi oposmg an adjournment ol Congiess
on Monda}, the 9th of October
Mi BELL designated it as of an exttaordmary
and unprecedented charactei, in the situation of
the public business, when the Senate must have
known that the House had not passed upon one
single measure releried to it Was it intended, he
asked, that they should have long night sessions'*
Was it intended they should act by v otmg instead
of discussion1 Was it intended as a rebuke upon
the House that it was too slow"* Were the Senate
to be then masters, speaking thus indirectly' Why,
thcie was nothing pailiamentary about the resolu-
tion but itsiorm—nothing but the mere parhamen-
taiy couitesy—every thing else in it was an insult
to the House, since the Senate could not but know
that they (the Hou e) had not acted on one of the
nnpoitint measures before them
Mr B well knew the ltiteiest felt th<>re by ma-
ny memheis for an eaily adjournment, but he
tiusted the gieat body of them would still, whalev-
ei then nnvale feelings or interests might be,
would jiekl sufficiently to allow time for discussing
the impoita.nl measures introduced into the Hou e
He then fore moved (o lay the resolution on the
table
Mi CAMBRELENG app°aled to Ibe gentle-
man to withdraw the motion.
Mr BELL refused
Mr HAYNES asked, ior the yeas and nays
theieon, which weie ordered
Mi REED thought it better to refer the subject
to a committee
Mr MERCER asked leave to offer a resolution
connected w ith the subjec*
The CHAIR íemaiked that it could not be sub-
mitted till this question was decided
Mr BELL, atthe request of Mi MERCER, with-
drew his motion, and the latter gentleman caused
his pi oposition to be read It was, m substance, that
the Clerk of the House furnish a statement of the
daily cost of the session of the two Houses, exclu-
sive of then contingent expenses, and the aggregate
cost of mileage ot members thereof
Objection being made from v anous parts of the
hall,
Mi MERCER mov eel a suspens on of the rule,
and asked forthe}eas and mvs Both motions
weie lejectcel, not one-fifth /oting foi the call, and
the latter w ithout a division
Mr BELL then resumed his me tion to la/Ihe
subject on the table
Mr HAYNJES asked for the yeas and navs,
which were ordered,  and were yeas 94, nays 121
So the House refused to lay the subject on the
table.
Mr CAMBRELENG said that under the im-
pression that the House had no disposition to dis-
cuss this proposition, he v ould callfor the previous
question
Mr ADAMS íeque^ted the g-"rtleman to with-
draw that motion, to enable him to submit an
amendment     [Loud cries of " No1 no'"]
The House divided, and the Chair announced 90
is seconding the call for the previous question,
when
Mr CAMBRELENG, for the purpose, he said,
of avoiding debate at that time, moved to postpone
the further consideration of the resolution till Mon-
day next, and that it be made t íe special order of
that day at 11 o'clock    Agreed to
Mr ADAMS laid on the table a proposition to
amend the resoluiion, by staking out Monday, the
9tn of October, and inserting the first Monday in
April next     [Great laughter ]
Mr MERCER gave notice of his intention, at
a proper time, to submit his anendment.

the form of a substitute, for several of the bills
before tho House, which was m the following
