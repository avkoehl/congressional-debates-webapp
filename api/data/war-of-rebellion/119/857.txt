SIR: I have the honor to report that cases of smallpox appear every day or two, but as soon as discovered they are sent to California Hospital. I visit the prison several times a day, and have taken every precaution to prevent the spreading of the disease. I have the honor to inform you that there was but one case of smallpox in the prison on the day that several were reported to General Hitchcock, and that case was removed to California Hospital the same day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. M. FORD,

Acting Assistant Surgeon, U. S. Army, in Charge.
