(Received 11 a. m.)

Major General C. C. AUGUR:

I cannot believe that there is any infantry in the Bull Run Mountains, as reported by the commanding officer of Fairfax. Let him push out his scouts or cavalry and find out. It has been reported to me that some of the enemy's cavalry are encamped near Rappahannock Mountains-northwest of Warrenton. This cavalry came from the Luray Valley-went over there to get food for their horses.

Some of Lomax's cavalry have been about Little Washington. Is it not a mistake? I will send a division of cavalry to the east side of the Blue Ridge to-morrow. It will pass through Ashby's Gap, and will move down and take post for a few days at Snickersville.
