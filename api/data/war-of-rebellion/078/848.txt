[THIRD indorsement.]

SEPTEMBER, 22, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Colonel St. John. It is understood that the mill at Selma is ready for work. Is there any one to run it?

J. GORGAS.

[Fourth indorsement.]

SEPTEMBER 26, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the Chief of Ordnance. One of the proprietors (J. B. Knight) has informed this Bureau that the Selma powder-mills were nearly ready for operation. It will be useless, however, to commence work unless the niter production of Alabama can be continued uninterrupted.

I. M. ST. John,

Colonel and Chief of Bureau.

[Fifth indorsement.]

SEPTEMBER 27, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War, calling attention to the indorsement of Colonel St. John. It will be necessary to keep up the production of niter at all hazards. I trust orders will be given to that effect to commanding generals.

J. GORGAS.

PALMETTO, September 20, 1864.

Major DAMERON,

I understand that you have flour. Please send to WEST Point for this army as much as you can without delay. The operations of this army render it necessary that I should have flour, to let me have which I hope you will make every effort. Please inform me how much and when you can send.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
