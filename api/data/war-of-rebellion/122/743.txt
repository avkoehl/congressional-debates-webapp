Governor A. G. CURTIN,

I desire the troops at Harrisburg to come here. It is not my wish, however, that the troops at Philadelphia should be sent to Harrisburg. I will be obliged to you if you will visit me in this city to consult about our Pennsylvania troops. It is impossible fr me to leave at present, otherwise I would come to Harrisburg.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Ruff will be up to see to-morrow. I am very much pressed with business, more particularly as the Legislature will soon meet. Could not be in Washington until Sunday. If that will do, and you deem it important, will come on. I would be much pleased to confer with you as to troops here and at Washington. Could see General McClellan at the time indicated.
