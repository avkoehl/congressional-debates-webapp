THB CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
March 16,
that quantity ought to bear a just proportion not
only to the amount of our business and the -
number of our people, but also to the magni-
tude of our territory and the average sparse-
ness of our population. I stop not to explain.
The general reason is that a circulating medium
moving in long circuits and with the same speed
will not touch the same point so often as if the
circuit be shorter. The telegraph and exchange
lessen but do not by any means obliterate this
element. Hence inferences from compact pop-
ulations like those of France and Great Britain
will not accurately apply to a similar industrial
population spread over the immense area of
this, Republic, extending from the eastern to
the western sea, and from the northern line to
the Keys of Florida. We need relatively more
money.
2. There are eight or ten millions of our peo-
ple left by the exhaustion of the rebellion with
very little money—I allude, of course, to the
southern States. The people of these States,
white and black, have not nearly the requisite
amount of money. When this great vacuum
shall be supplied, as I hope it speedily maybe,
the tendency will be to relieve any plethora
existing in the North.
3. The emancipated career upon which the
Kepublic now enters, the larger liberty and the
consequent greater vitality of every branch of
Industry, will lead to the ready and healthy
appropriation of much more money than we
needed heretofore.
4. X understand it to be a fact, considering
all markets and looking over the country com-
prehensively, that prices during the year now
past have gradually lowered.
5. 1 understand it to be a fact that gold, dur-
ing the year now past, has gradually coine down,
or, in other words, that greenbacks have grad-
ually risen in value.
0. 1 understand it to be a fact that there is
no money in the West that cannot be readily
loaned at ten per cent., showing, or at least
tending to show, that the supply is not super-
abundant.
These are some of the general elements of
the question'before us; and every gentleman
will appreciate their bearing without one word
of comment.
But, sir, if contraction is necessary, do so
either by commencing with the national banks
or by applying a portion of our surplus rev-
enue to retiring the greenbacks. I cannot and
will not, as at present advised, consent to the
taking up of the greenbacks and the substitu-
tion of interest-paying bonds in their stead,
thus adding largely to our interest-bearing debt,
and consequently adding to the taxation levied
on the labor of the country. Sir, the labor of
this country, in the last analysis and when you
get. to the bottom of the matter, is charged with
the payment of our great national debt. The
capitalist hands over to the tax-gatherer money
that was first made and placed in his coffers by
the hard hand of labor. I repeat it, the labor
of the country carries the burden of the na-
tional debt; and I will not on this occasion add
to that burden by increasing the tax-paying
debt of the people while taking from them a
better money to make room for a worse one.
Sir, 1 very determinedly vote against the bill.
Mr. MORRILL. 1 do not propose to oc-
cupy much of the time of the House at this late
period. 1 will directly move the previous ques-
tion. 1 yield now live minutes to the gentle-
man from Ohio.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
at this late hour 1 do not propose to discuss in
detail the bill now before the House. During
the few minutes allotted to me 1 will only state
the points of objection which I have to this
measure.
It proposes to carry out an avowed policy
of converting "the lawful money of the Uni-
ted States"—the '' greenbacks"—into national
bonds.
The effect of this will be—
1. To convert a debt on which the Govern-
ment pays no interest into a debt bearing in-
terest at an unnecessary annual expense to the
nation of $27,000,000 for interest.
2. It will reduce the price of labor and of all
property by diminishing the amount of our cir-
culating medium. This will increase the bur-
den of the tax-payers by requiring a larger
amount of property and labor to pay the taxes
of the country than will be required if no such
reduction takes place. In other words, it will
increase the burdens and diminish the resources
of the people ; it will diminish all but the pub-
lic debt.
3. It will be productive of the injustice of re-
quiring the people to pay with labor and prop-
erty at low prices a national debt contracted
in part for supplies at high prices. I am op-
posed to the bill because I am opposed to these
results, and because—
1. The bill is unnecessary as shown by the
laws in force and by a statement of the public
debt, no material part of which will become
due until in December, 1867, and July, 1868.
It will be time enough to legislate on the sub-
ject a year hence, when circumstances may
have so changed as to render a different kind
of legislation necessary, and when the whole
subject of finances, taxation, &c., will be better
understood in their relations to the business
and interests of the country.
I submit to the House the following:

Tho foregoing is a correct statement of the public

hugii Mcculloch,
Secretary of the Treasury.
The following letter was written by the Comp-
troller of the Currency in reply to an inquiry
asking his opinion of the loan bill:
Treasury Department,
Office of the Comptroller op the Currency,
February 24,1866.
My Dear Sir: Your letter of to-day is received,
and in reply I have to say that I am decidedly op-
posed to the loan bill for the following reasons:
By the aot of June 30,1864 United States notes can
be converted into compound-interest notes; and by
the act of March 3,1865, certificates of indebtedness,
compound-interest notes, five per cent, legal-tender
notes, and seven-thirty Treasury notes can be con-
verted into five-twenty bonds; and that portion of
the temporary loan that it is desirable should bo
paid, can be paid from money now m the Treasury,
which I suppose must be at this time, including de-
posits in national banks, at least one hundred and
fifty million dollars, and the amount that it would bo
expedient to pay would not be more than the amount
of the incresse of the deposit for the last few weeks,
and which the Government has not had any occasion
to use. We have, therefore, full powers to fund e^ry
dollar of the floating debt without any further legis-
lation on tho subject, and no occasion for making
any loan for any purpose whatever. All can be done
by simply exchanging one-security for another, a,nd
can be quietly done without essentially disturbing
the money market or the business of the country, the
Secretary of the Treasury being the judge as to how
far and how rapid the movements in reference to
conversion should proceed.
I think there is Misdoubt about the willingness of
the holders of the floating debt to convert into five-
twenty bonds to the extent that is desirable, if the
credit of our securities is sustained, but if authority
is given to put bonds upon tho market to an almost
unlimited amount, and to sell at any price, as pro-
vided in the bill, would, in my view, cause such un-
certainty in the public mind as to render it impossi-
ble to keep up theprice of the Government securities
I do not think a loan of $50,000,000 could be negoti-
ated without sinking tho pricc of five-twenty bonds
below par, as the public would not know how soon
another $50,000,000, $500,000,000 or $1,000,000,000 might
be put upon the market.
As to the provision in reference to a foreign loan,
it would, in my view, if carried into effect, be almost
suicidal. If bonds are sold abroad the price would
be based, of course, upon the present currency rate
of exchange, consequently the Government would
receive about sixty dollars in gold for each $100 in
bonds, payable in gold, with semi-annual interest
also payable in gold; in addition to exchange, com-
missions, &c. And in addition, if the Government
should sell its bonds abroad to the extent to affect
the price of gold, say twenty per cent., it would lessen
tojust that extent the net proceeds of the bonds, and
instead of sixty realize only forty dollars for each $100
of bonds. .
Yours, tr*ly, • FREEMAN CLARKE.
Instead of legislation authorizing a reduc-
tion of the United States legal-tender notes we
need a limitation on existing laws to prevent
any reduction of the currency beyond that which
will result from funding the legal-tender com-
pound-interest notes, which will be a sufficient
and more than sufficient reduction during the
coming year.
By existing law the Secretary of the Treas^
ury can fund the compound-interest notes over
one hundred and eighty million dollars.
This isapartof tlie currency of the country.
If all this should be suddenly funded the spin-
dles of New England, the furnaces and forges
of Pennsylvania, and all the great industrial
pursuits of the great West and of the whole
country would receive a shock from which they
could not recover without wide-spread bank-
ruptcy and ruin.
But this bill proposes to give authority to
withdraw from circulation not only all this cur-
rency but untold millions more. Let the com-
pound-interest notes be funded first and grad-
ually, and then if it shall be found practicable
a further reduction can be gradually made.
Time and circumstances will determine our
policy as to this.
2. It is a mistake to suppose that there is a
great redundancy of currency in circulation.
This is proved by a comparison of the amount
of money in circulation in this and other coun-
tries, and an examination of our resources and
business.
"France has a circulating medium, mostly specie,
of about one thousand million dollars. Englandhas
some six or seven hundred million dollars."
Yet the population of England and France
each i s not materially different in numbers from
that of the United States.
3. A reduction of the currency will be fol-
lowed bv high rates of interest among the peo-
ple, and, as a consequence, a depreciation of
the value of national bonds, and of property
