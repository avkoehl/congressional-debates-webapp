STATE ARMORY, Richmond, July 8, 1861.

Colonel C. DIMMOCK,

Chief of Ordnance:

SIR: I have this morning received from Major Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance Department of the Confederate States, instructions to supply Mr. M. E. Price with certain tools essential to the repair of arms in the field, and on yesterday Mr. Adams, the master armorer, received instructions from the same source to turn over to Mr. Smith, of the laboratory, three turning lathes and driving gears for the same. I have as yet received no authority to comply with such requisitions, and I therefore respectfully request that you will favor me with your instructions as to how I shall act in the premises.

I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,

JAMES H. BURTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel of Ordnance.

[Indorsement.]

Until the order of the Governor is received this department cannot be governed by orders from elsewhere.

C. DIMMOCK,

Colonel of Ordnance of Virginia.

Richmond, July 11, 1861.

Lieutenant-Colonel DIMMOCK,

Richmond:

SIR: Your indorsement on the order of the Secretary of War, given through the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, has been referred to him. You will excuse me for calling your attention to the fact that your action may involve serious embarrassments to the troops in the field.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. GORGAS,

Major and Chief of Ordnance.

ORDNANCE OFFICE, July 12, 1861.

Colonel DIMMOCK,

Ordnance, State of Virginia:

COLONEL: Will you do me the favor to see me at your leisure in reference to the tools required by Smith. By retaining tools necessary to our operations in the laboratory the State does great injury to the common defense.

Respectfully,

J. GORGAS.

[Indorsement.]

The tools, lathes, &amp; c., asked for as "retained" never were in the laboratory, and never formed any part of that establishment, but belong to the musket machinery.

C. DIMMOCK,

Colonel.
