PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
On motion of Mí. CAMBRELENG, the menage
of the President to Congress was theft taken up,
and referred to a Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, and on motion of the same gen-
tleman, the House went thereon into committee,
Mr. J. a. ADAMS m the Chair
The Message being taken up in committee—
Mr. CAMBRELENG introduced two resolu-
tions, as follows •
1.  Resolved, That so much of the President's
Message as relates to the finances of the country,
be retened to the Committee of Ways and Means
2.  Resolvtd, That so much of the President's
Message as relates to a bankrupt law, be refeired
to the Committee on the Judiciary.
The two resolutions were severally agreed to
«em dts , whcn,onmotion of Mr CAMBRELENG,
the committee rose and reported them to the House,
and they were both severally concurred m
Mr CAMBRELENG then submitted the follow-
ing resolution
Eesolv/tl, That so mctói  of the report of the Se-
cietary of the Treasu** on the state of the finances
as relates to the. finances of the country, be re-
ferred to the Committee of Ways and Means, and
that so muf^i 0f said repoit as relates to a bankrupt
jl     le^ellec' t0 me Committee on the Judiciary.
i^r. EWING made an inquiry of the chairman
t>t the Committee of Ways and Means, whether
his motion had any reference to, or was intended to
embrace, any proposition foi the relief of the mer-
chants, and the extension of their bonds.
Mr CAMBRELENG replied by stating that the
terms he had used in his motion embraced every
topic relating to the public finances, and, of course,
necessirtly and dnectly involved the question of
extending the time oí payment of the merchants'
bonds. It embraced all the various topics con-
nected with the subject of íelief, and it was cer-
tainly not Mi C's intention to suffer so important
a proposition as that to escape his attention He
thought it not improbable that the gentleman's
views and his own would concur, but he would
confine* himself then by replying to the gentleman,
that it was the design of his motion to embrace
that as well as every other topic adveited to on the
*>ubjeot
Mr EWING then movtd to stnke out the
words "the Committee of Ways and Means," and
insert in lieu thereof the following " A select som-
rmltee, with power to inquiie into existing lans, m
connection w th orders <in<l legulatiors adopted hy
the 'Ireanuv, W?i, and Post Oilice Depailmems,

mereial, and manufacturing interests of the Union;

After a few remarks m suppoit of the amend-
ment by Mr E it was lejected, and the original
lesolution -was agreed to
On motion oí Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio,
and by geneial consent, a resolution «as agreed to,
directing the Clerk of the House not to have any
maps punted in book« oideicd for the use of the
II lusc, unless the maps be specially ordered to be
pr n'< c1
Mi SMITH, on leave, then submitted the fol-
lowing i =s ilu'ion
Resolved, That the action of the several standing
committees of this House on all matters not
embiaced by the Message of the President of the
United States to the two Houses of Congress, com-
municated on the second day of the current session,
be suspended until the commencement of the
annual session of Congress, in December next, and
tint the consideration of all petitions on such sus-
pended matteis be also postponed to the period
above specified
Mr, SMITH «aid he did not conceive how it
was to be expected by those who had claims upon
the Government, that the general business of Con-
gress should be taken up He was aware that
while the Committee of Wavs and Means and
the Committee on the Judiciary had under conside-
ration the subjects which were referred to them,
theie might be an interval m which it might be pos-
sible to consider some other subjects, but it is not
to be expected that this session can be continued
sufficiently long to mature anv other bu-mess than
that which we have been specially called to act
upon. It would net in the first place, be proper to
take up general subjects, becau ewe are not in pos-
session of the means of canying out that business
The President has refrained entirely fiom entenng
into matters of general legislation Then if we are
to go into other matteis, it will be absolutely indis-
pensable that an immediate call be made upon the
Executive foi the necessaiy information This,
howevei, he apprehended was not the couise
which the majonty of lhe House would desue
to see taken It was not to be expected by those
having claims against the Government that this
couise ef proceeding should be adopted. But he
presumed the gentleman from Ohio (Mr Whittle-
sey) would say that there were numeious claims
which have been presented to the House and ex-
amined by a committee, which might be acted upon
at this session In answer to this he v. ould say,
that it would hardly be just to other claiman's who
have not had their claims brought before the House,
to give precedence to (he claims the gentleman had
on a former day alluded to He considered that it
would be better to suspend all thos-e claims for the
present, and that the business we were called to
deliberate upon should be proceeded vv r-b. He, for
one, wished that the special business might be the
sole business of the session, and it appeared to
him that a íesponsibility rested upon every gentle-
man, in conducting the business of the ptesent ses-
sion with an eye single to the great mattei which
we are heie assembled to deliberate upon If it
shall be discovered that ws can do nothing, let it
be known as soon as possible, so that ths country
shall not be kept in suspense.
Mr. WHITTLESEY of Ohio understood the
gentleman from Mame (Mr Smith) to make two
exceptions to the course he wished to see pursued
by the House In the first place, the gentleman
opposed going into business generally, because the
Piesulent of the United Slates had not communi-
cated the subjects to Cong-ess In relation to the
íecommc ndalion of the President, the gentleman
may scaich m vain, fiom the organization of the
Government to the piesent tunc, to find the subject
of the claims alluded to biought to the notice
of the House They are not piesented in the
message as subjects foi ouf deliberation, be-
cause it is a part of our duty to examine and
decide upon them without any recommendation
of the President It is a pait of the legisla-
tive business of Congress to take -up and con-
sider this matter, and there is no necessih for a re-
commendation fiom the Fxecutive As to the in-
formation which may be desired from the Execu-
tive officers ot the Government, we can get at any
time all the information which may be necessary.
Pven if Congress only sits six weeks, he considered
that it would be propei to call for the estimates of
the departments, ami proceed to act upon thorn, be-
cause it is a fact that the officers of the Govern-
ment Tie frequently in anticipation of fher salaries
for months before the appiopnations are made to
pay them, and they aie fiequently at the meicy of
the merchants for a subsistence As fo the objection
of the gentleman in lelahon to the preference which
wonld be 'tven to one class of claims over another
he had only to say, ha considered that those claims
«Inch had been before the House for years, ought
to be discharged befoie those v, h ch only ongmated
oi v ere presented on yesterua v He was not for
piolongmg the session, but he wished all the time
we had to spaie devoted to business of this desctip-
uon.
Mr WILLIAMS of North Caroha, did not con-
sider that the House was now prepared to act on
this subject, and with a view to give time to con-
sider the matter, he moved to postpone the resolu-
tion until Wednesday next.
Mr. BELL would cheerfully support this motion,
if it were possi-le to get such information from the
Committee of Ways and Means as could deter-
mine what projects would piobably be brought
before the House at the present session. No per-
son would deny that the subject brought to our
notice in the message of the President was broad
enough for the occupation of our whole time, pro-
vided the committees íeported conformably to the
lecommendations there laid down. If he could be
informed as to the intention of the Committee of
Wajs and Means, or of those who were in the
majonty in the House, m relation to bringing for-
ward a project for the íegulation of the fiscal con-
cerns of the Government, he could then determine
what course to piusue. In relation to some parts
of that very extiaordmary document, the message
of the Piesident, he piesumed there were some sen-
timents contained in it, which would meet the sup-
poit of members from all sides of the House; and
he should now be pleased to learn from the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, or some other individual who could
give the information, what was to be the
conree of action of that committee on the
subject. If it was to be expected that no other
piopositions than these should be brought forward,
he apprchende I that we might, m the course of a
short time, conclude our labors, and return to our
constituents, and if no other propositions were
brought forward than these, then he would have no
hesitation in voting for the íesolutionof the gentle-
man from Maine But if it was the deteimmation
of the committee to bring foi ward nothing but the very
extraordinary proposition in relation to the finances
of the country, he apprehended that the majority of
the House \\ ould not be long in rejecting it. He
considered it a project which the majonty of the
committee would hardly take upon themselves to
bung before the House, and, if brought there, he
took it that no majority of that House or adminis-
tration would ventuie to urge it upon the coun-
try. It appeared to him to be a project which was
utterly impiactieable, and could not be adopted
It may, to be sure, be in the pew er of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means to bung forward a project
of this kind; but if it did, h° had little doubt that it
would be rejicted. If, however, the Committee
of Ways and Means should introduce a modi-
fied project, with a view of arresting the
distresses of the country, he would vote against tak-
ing up any thing which would interfere with this
great and important matter He would render
every aid m his powei to cairy out some practica-
ble project, to avert the evils which w ere impend-
ing over us, but he could not give countenance to
any such pioject as that recommended in the Mes-
sage When he received information from the
Committee of "Wajs and Means as to the course
intended to be adopted by that committee, he would
be better prepared to give his vote than at present,
and should wait till he received the inioimation de-
sned.
Mr CAMBRELENG said that the gentleman
from Tennessee having called upon him for infor-
mation though it was not strictly m order, under
the resolution thev v\ere discussing, yet he would
make a brief response The gentleman must be
perfectly sensible that, in the present position of the
Committee of Wajs and Means, for it had only
been just announced, he (Mr C) could do no
more than answer for himself. Thus far, howevei
he w auld take upon himself to answer for the com-
mittee, that he was very certain every member of
it would give an immediate attention to the sub-
jects embraced m the Pres dent's message, and re-
fen ed to it, and that ¡hey would bring forward their
bills at the very earliest day, and with the greatest
possible dispatch He also expressed the hope that
the House would confine itself, as far as practica-
ble to the propositions embraced in the message.
On some these, he believed there would be a genel
ral concuirence, not only m that committee, but m
the House itself
Upon the other gieat question adverted to m the
Message, he should not, at that time, prematurely
engage in any debate    The gentleman, however,
