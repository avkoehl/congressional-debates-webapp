SIR: Learning that I with two of my friends are confined in this prisoner under your charge as hostages for three negroes, captured in South Carolina, if it is allowed, it will afford me much pleasure to know at what time and place these negroes were captured, and if the United States Government will exchange us if these negroes are released by the Confederate Government. My reasons for wishing information on this point are that I may write to my friends and let them use their influence to effect this exchange. By giving me the necessary information you will much oblige,

Your obedient servant,

C. J. McDOWELL,
