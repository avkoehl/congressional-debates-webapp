Colonel WILLARD WARNER,

180th Ohio Volunteer Infantry:

COLONEL: You will take with you the mounted men of the two companies of the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry under Captain Couch, and have them march one day in advance of you, so that they can give you all necessary information. If before arriving at Fayetteville you learn that our troops have not reached Pulaski, you will march to Columbia, instead of Pulaski, as ordered in paragraph II, Special Orders, Numbers 4; and you will also retain the cavalry with you till you have arrived within safe distance of our forces; but if you find that our troops are at Pulaski, you will send the cavalry back from Fayetteville to Decherd, and will proceed with your command, as directed in paragraph II, Special Orders, Numbers 4. If you cannot learn the whereabouts of our troops after reaching Fayetteville, you will march to Columbia, as it would be to dangerous for you to march to Pulaski with one regiment, if any part of the enemy is occupying that place.

By command of Major-General Milroy:

JNO. O. CRAVENS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NOTE.-If you learn at Fayetteville that the enemy has passed Pulaski, you will march to that point.

By command of Major-General Milroy:
