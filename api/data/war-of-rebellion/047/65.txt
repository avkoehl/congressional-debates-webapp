I do not fear heavy guns from Sumter, but wish to keep down the fire of small guns. your fire will help me very much. I am sorry that your guns are giving out.

GILLMORE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Morris Island, S. C., August 26, 1863.

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

MY DEAR SIR: I shall be able, I think, to light up the waters between Fort Sumter and Cumming's Point, so that no small boats can approach the latter without being seen by your picket boats. My plan is to locate the lights at the left of my second parallel, and throw a cone of rays subtending an angle of 15 or 20, the right or easterly element of which will pass through Cumming's Point and include Fort Sumter. Will this interfere with your plan of operations for to-night. If so, please inform me by the bearer, Lieutenant Bragg, of my staff.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
