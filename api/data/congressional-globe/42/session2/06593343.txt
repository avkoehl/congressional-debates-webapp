be again read, so we may be able to under-
stand it.
The CHAIRMAN. It was read once already
when offered in the nature of a substitute.
Mr. EAMES. I ask it to be again read,
for we certainly ought to know on what we
are voting.
Mr. BINGHAM. I beg leave to ask whether
it is not an amendment to the text, and not
in the nature of a substitute? That is the
proposition of the gentleman from Kentucky.
As I understand it, the amendment of the
gentleman from New York is limited to the
original text. The substitute moved by the
gentleman from Kentucky is still pending,
and not to be voted on until the original text
has been perfected.
Mr. COX. The amendment is limited to
the subject of cotton.
The CHAIRMAN. The amendment just
read is limited to the subject of cotton.
Mr. BECK. I desire to say a word on the
amendment of the gentleman from New York.
Mr. KELLEY. As I understand iu the
gentleman from Rhode Island has called for
the reading of the amendment of the gentle-
man from New York, because it has not yet
Jjggjj rea(J
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair asked the
gentleman from Rhode Island whether he in-
sisted on his demand for the reading of that
part which had already been read, and which
was taken from the old bill, and as he did not
receive any answer, he supposed the gentle-
man from Rhode Island did not insist on his
demand.
Mr. EAMES. I asked to have the amend-
ment read, in order that I might understand
precisely what were its provisions. The Chair
inquired whether I insisted on the reading, and
I said that I did, but in the confusion I pre-
sume the Chair did not hear me. My only
object is to know precisely what it is we are
voting on, and if any gentleman in the House
will state what it is the gentleman from New
York proposes to insert, I will withdraw my
demand for the reading.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Kentucky is on the floor to debate the amend-
ment. It is the same amendment moved by
the gentleman from New York when the
House was in committee before. The amend-
ment was read excepting the portion taken
from the old bill, which he proposes to insert,
striking out all after the ninth line in the pend-
ing section. If the gentleman, however, de-
sires to have it read, the Chair will direct the
Clerk to read it.
Mr. EAMES. I do.
The Clerk proceeded with the reading.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I suppose
the gentleman from Rhode Island does not
want really to have this read, but he merely
wants to waste the time of the House.
Mr. COX. Of course he does, and he will
get enough of it before he gets through.
The Clerk continued the reading.
Mr. EAMES. I withdraw my request .for
any further reading, as I do not wish to delay
the House. I merely made the request to
have the matter proposed to be inserted read
that we might know exactly what it is on
which the gentleman from New York proposes
a reduction from ten to twenty per cent.
Mr. BECK. If it is the object of any gen-
tleman on the other side by delays and calling
for constant reading from the Clerk's desk to
prevent the consideration of this bill, I think
he will find that he commits a mistake. The
bill may as well be considered now when it is
before us for that pursose.
My reason for introducing a substitute for
the first twenty-five lines of the section, is, in
the first place, because a uniform reduction
of ten per cent, does not and cannot even
approach doing justice. I offer as a substi-
tute the bill of the committee, because that
bill, in regard to iron, cotton, and woolen
manufactures, does attempt to discriminate
intelligently, and while it does not reduce the
duties as low perhaps as they ought to have
been reduced, still it takes off only small per-
centages where the articles will not bear a
large reduction, and it takes off large percent-
ages where it is obvious that large reductions
ought to be made.
In other words, instead of applying a uni-
form leveling scale, without sense, rh>me, or
reason, the committee, after full investigation,
and after hearing all parties interested, en-
deavored by moderate reductions to do justice
to all interested, and if gentlemen will turn to
the table which I had published in the Globe
of last Thursday, and will look over that por-
tion of the table relating to cotton manufac-
tures, in regard to which the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Cox] now proposes to restore
the provisions of the bill of the committee-,
they will find that on manufactures of cotton
the bill reduces unbleached from thirty-seven
to twenty-seven per cent. ; colored, &c., from
fifty-one per cent, to forty per cent, j some
others from sixty per cent, to forty-nine per
cent. ; and some others from seventy-six per
cent, to sixty-two per cent., the average re-
duction being about twenty per cent, as now
proposed by the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. Cox.] On some of the articles, however,
the reduction is not over fifteen per cent. ; on
some it is sixteen per cent.; on some it is
fourteen, depending altogether upon what the
committee were made to understand, by the
proof before us, ought to be done in each par-
ticular case.
It is known to the Committee of the Whole
that it is impossible in any tariff to arrange
everything so as to reach exact justice by any
uniform descending scale.
But the committee designed by intelligent
action, without seriously interfering with any
of the interests sought to be protected—for
there is protection in the whole of it—so to
reduce the duty in each case as to make it
approximate to what it should be. This will
appear from the table to which I have re-
ferred, and which shows what has been done,
done intelligently, and I think done well, to
the extent we have gone.
I therefore offered the provisions of the bill
as a substitute, that we might consider together
the whole question of iron, woolen, and cotton
manufactures. And the gentleman from New
York [Mr. Cox] proposes to take it up in de-
tail, by offering as a substitute the portion
relating only to cotton manufactures. I sub-
mit that the Committee of the Whole, in order
to act intelligently, should look at the action
of the Committee of Ways and Means. They
will see that, while we have made no serious
reductions, while we have not reduced to the
extent we ought to have gone, in my judgment,
still our reductions are made far more intelli-
gently than can be the result of any uniform
reduction taking off ten or any other per
cent.
That is all I desire to say, in addition to
submitting as part of my remarks the portion
of the table relating to cotton manufactures,
that members of the committee may see what
will be the effect of the propositions of the
Committee of Ways and Means. It is as fol-
lows:
