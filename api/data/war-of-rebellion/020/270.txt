casualty occurred among any of these troops, with the exception only of one in Fort Moultrie. Early in the action our flag-staff was shot away, and in falling struck private J. S. Lusby, Company F, inflicting a severe wound, from which he died in a short time. Neither the fort itself nor its material was in the least injured.

It is due to the garrison of Fort Moultrie and their soldierly and accomplished commander, Colonel Butler, that I should not close this report without bearing testimony to the admirable skill, coolness, and deliberation with which they served their guns. They went all, men as well as officers, to their work cheerfully and with alacrity, showing that their hearts were in it. There was enthusiasm, but no excitement. They lost no time in loading their guns, but never fired hastily or without aim. The reports of Colonel Keitt, Lieutenant-Colonel Simkins, and Captain Sigreaves give me every reason to believe that the garrisons of Batteries Bee and Beauregard acquitted themselves equally well, and are equally entitled to the thanks and gratitude of their commander and their country. Colonel Butler makes Honorable mention of the following officers:

Captain William H. Wigg, A. C. S., when the flag-staff was shot away, promptly mounted a traverse and placed the regimental flag in a conspicuous place upon it. Captain G. A. Wardlaw, assistant quartermaster, and Lieutenant and Adjt. Mitchell King and First Lieutenant D. G. Calhoun were likewise prompt in placing the battle and garrison flags in conspicuous positions. Lieutenant Williams, ordnance officer, is also favorably mentioned.

To Capts. William Greene and B. G. Pinckney, of my staff, and First Lieutenant A. H. Lucas, my aide-de-camp, I am indebted for valuable assistance; and my thanks are also due to Lieutenant Colonel O. M. Dantzler and Dr. G. W. Westcott, volunteer aides for the occasion.

I have the honor to transmit herewith a statement in tabular form showing the expenditure of ammunition by Fort Moultrie and the batteries during the action.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

J. H. TRAPIER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
