I had support the enemy were attacking Peck to prevent his re-enforcing Foster; but if with the numbers alleged, it must be for a more important purpose. As soon as Stoneman's designs are discovered to the enemy, Peck will be relieved. The enemy have not to exceed 30, 000 men between Richmond and Suffolk, including both of those towns.
