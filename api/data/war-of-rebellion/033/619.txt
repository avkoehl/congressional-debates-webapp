Major JAMES H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Jefferson City, Mo.:

What force have you at Jefferson City? The rebels may march on Jefferson City via Versailles. Do not run any risk of losing that place by moving up to Tipton or Syracuse. Better call in all the troops from that direction to Jefferson City, and let Colonel Hall try to join General Brown if he is compelled to leave Sedalia; at all events concentrate your troops, and on no account allow yourself to be cut off from Jefferson City. I am sending you re-enforcements. The rebel force is probably about 2,000 strong.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Commanding Officer, Lebanon, Mo.:

The rebels reached Warsaw this morning, and are reported still going north. They will probably be driven back near Lebanon. Re-enforcements will reach you to-day, and more to-morrow. Do all in your power to intercept the rebels. Colonel Edwards is in pursuit from Springfield. Send this information to him by several messengers. Answer.

Colonel GRAVELY, Lebanon, Mo.:

Advise me every few hours of your movements and your information.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Colonel GEORGE H. HALL, Sedalia, Mo.:

Send information of the rebels' movements to General Ewing, at Rose Hill, inform him he should move eastward and join General Brown, if he has no other instruction from the general.

Colonel EDWARDS, Springfield, Mo.:

Your dispatch of yesterday is received. The enemy was at Warsaw this morning, probably making for Sedalia. He cannot well escape to the west, but will probably be driven back toward Lebanon. If you
