bility which belonged to a repiesentative of the
■whole people, and to state that he differed,mtolo,
from the sentiments expressed in the memorial,
and ashe learned, through the medium of the news-
papers, that some of the memouals were to be sent
to all the representatives of Georgia, he must frank-
ly state, that he could not give any aid to procure
the result which they desired He would also
state, that his impi essions of the sentiments of the
inhabitants of the State generally, from all that he
was able to learn, and more particulaily by letters
from the community in which he resided, was that,
they were decidedly in opposition to the sentiments
expressed m this memorial, and that, unless he had
been grossly deceived, another memorial would be
sent on fiom that same city, which will confirm
his opinion, and prove that the sentiments ought

either m Congress or elsewhere, and to whose
