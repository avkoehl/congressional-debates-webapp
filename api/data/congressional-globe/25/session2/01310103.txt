On motion ot Mr BUCHANAN,
The bill to amend the act in add tion to the act
foi the funhhment of certain crimes agamst the
United States, and to lepeal the acts therein men-
tioned, «as taken up
Mr BUCHANAN observe 1 that it w a-, propri
he should give an explanation oí the principal pro-
visions of the bill now before the Senate, and he
should perform this duty with as much brevity as
possible The committee on Poreign Rrlations
(said Mr B ) ha\ e carefully examined the act oí
the 20th April, 1818, wmch embodied ill the foi-
merlawson the subject of ourneutial relations,
and have found that it is well adipted to enforce
the observance of our duties towards belligerent
nations They, therefore, do not propose to make
any material change in its provisions Under that
law, the citizens of the United States are not pro-
hibited from carrying on any trade sanctioned by
the law oí nations, noi is it the purpose oí this bill
to abridge or interfere with any such lawful tiade
The citizens of the United States have an unques-
tionable right to sell arms and munitions of Mar to
the citizens or subjects of belligerent powers who
come here to purchase them, without any viola
tion of our neutral obligations After this pur
chase has been made, the bjjer must get these ar-
ticles to the place of their destination as well as he
can.    If ihey are captured beyond the jurisdiction
of this country, by Ihe forces of his enemy, he sus-
tains the loss, but that enemy has no right to ask
our Government to prevent such sales Again
any citizen ol the United States may carry arms
and munitions of war for sale to one belligerent
nation without violating the neutrality ol his coun-
try towards the other Such a trade is not piolu-
biled by the law of nations It is true that such ar-
ticles, if captured by the enemy on their passage,
will be forfeited as contraband of war, but this is
the onlj penalty imposed on such a trade by the
la iv of nations It is a question m which ihe Go-
veimnentof the neutral country has no concern
Our pol cy has ever been to promote the greatest
fie d m of commerce consistent with our neutral
ob íeations As regards our trade by sea with all
foreign nations in aims and munitions of war, this
bill makes no change It will remain precisely as
it was
AVhat, then, is the object of this bill?    We have
ihree neighbors on our frontiers, Canada, Texas
and Mexico, and the duties of good neighborhood
requued something more from us in relation to
them than could be  strictly demanded under the
law of nations    In Europe, reciprocal treaiies be-
tween conterminous nations generally regulate this
mallei     In order to presei ve peace along the fron-
tiers, it is absolutely necessary that such regula-
tions should exist     It is against all reason and
justice, that in case of a sudden commotion in a
neighboring country along our irontiei s, the citizens
of the United States should be permuted to take
part with the insurgents, by furnishing them with
vessels, arms, and munitions oí war, for the ex-
press pmpose of aiding and assisting in such hosti-
lities     If this be tolerated, then it is m the power
of the people along the borders of our country to
force the whole nation into a war, whenever any
number of dissatisfied individuals rise against the
established Government of a neighboring State    It
is oui duty to prevent our citizens from aiding m
even revolutionary movement against a neighbor-
ing Government    To prevent and to remedy such
evils, is the sole object of the present bill   This bill
inflicts no penalties whatever  it is a measure of
prevention, not of punishment    The first section
piovides for the seizure of any vessel belonging to a
citizen   of the United States, and of the arms
and munitions of war which may be found therein,
which is about to pass our frontier, when the cir-
cumstances of the case shall lender it probable,
that sne is destined to be employed in cairymg on
hostilities against the citizens, subjects, or property
of a conterminous friendly State or Terntory, or m
givmgaid and comfort to the pel sons carry mgonsuch
hostilities, by conveying   o then assistance men,
di ms, or munitions of war     The  vessel and the
arms thus seized arc to be restored to the owner, as
soon  as he gives  security that they shall  not  be
cmplojcd in violating  the  provisions oí the bill
In  ci " he shall  not£ive   such security, they will
be detuned until  the Piesident orders   them to be
restored      It will  stuke  evciy Senator at once,
th-U such -i provision  is necessary to  pieserve the
trit qnillitj   of  the   country  along the lakes  and
mers which are the boundiuesof our territory
The sceond section makes a similai provision for
the sri/nre and detention of arms and munitions of
war helonging to a citizen of the United States,
when the circumstances of the case render it pro-
bable that they are about to be earned across tho
frontier for the same hostile purposes
Such provisions are not new to our law The
10th and 11th sections of the act of Apnl, 1818,
affoid a precedent for the first two sections oí this
bill The owner of any vessel described in those
sections, befoie it is petmitted to leave the United
States, is obliged to give security that it shall not
be employed in carrying on hostilities against a
friendly power
Mr B said he deemed it unnecessary foi the
present to go further into the subject He was pre-
pared, however, to give any furthei explanation
wh'ch any Senator might require     One  observa-
Itimi he would make before he took his seat In a
New York paper which he received this morning,
he had seen, with equal astonishment and regret,
a letter from Col M'Nabb, commanding a portion
of her Bntamc Majesty's forces in Canada, in
which he not only avows that the outrage on the
steamboat Caroline was commited by his orders,
but heglones in the deed He fancies that a Cap*
tain in the royal navy has acquired fresh laurels by-
becoming his agent in conducting this cowardly at-
tack, upon our unatmed and unsuspecting citizens
If any thing were wanting to aggravate the enormi-
ty ot this wanton outrage upon our terntory and
jurisdiction, it would be found in its open avowal
of justification by a British officer, high in com-
mand. The Bntish Government would have had
an equal right to send one of their ships of war into
the harbor of Boston or New York, to capture any
American vessel at anchor there, which they sus-
pected of hostile intentions against their country
The sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Uni-
ted States over our own territory has been
grossly violated, and if any thing could prevent
him from doing his duty in regard to this bill, it
would be the indignant feelings which had been
excited in his bosom by a perusal of this letter of
Col McNabb But the wrong which we have
suffered ought not to praventus from doing justice
We were bound to perform our duties towards all
nations, and we were imperatively bound to de-
mand of the British Government to hold Colonel
McNabb to a strict account for his conduct, and
not to be satisfied without the most ample atone-
ment.
He would now conclude by offering the three
sections which he held in his hand as a substitute
for the first three sections of the bill The purpose
of this amendment was to rendei the bill more
specific, to confine its operation with greater pre-
cision to cases which might occur along our jii-
teno). frontiers, and to expressly exclude any idea
of interference with our trade by sea in arms and
munitions of war
Mr RUGGLES hoped the Senator from Penn-
sylvania u ould not press the consideration of his
amendment at the present time He wished it
printed, that he might have an opportunity to ex-
amine its provisions He was not now prepared to
say what effect the provisions of the bill would
have upon the condition of things on our North-
eastern border. He wished time to consider whe-
ther any and what modifications of the pioposed
amendment may be necessary to meet the case re-
ferred to It is doubtless in the recollection of the
committee, that a large portion of the territory of
Mame is, now, and has been for a number of years,
in the possession of Great Britain If troops oi
arms should be transported into that part of the
territory of Mame by the Government of that
State, foi the pmpose of taking possession of and
defending it, would it be a violation of the provi-
sions of the bill, and justify the President in order-
ing their apprehension and se'zure1 If this Go-
vernment does not protect her jurisdictional rights,
he trusted she would be left at liberty to defend her
own soil He saw no good reason for urging foi-
ward the action of the Senate on the bill under
consideration, and hoped it would be postponed a
day or two at least He said it was understood
that despatches had been recently received from
the Bntish Government, or are soon expected.
They might perhaps contain something from that
Government relating to the subject of the boundar)
If satisfactory, very well If the matter is left
where it has been for the last eight or ten years, it
will be time to consider whether our relations with
that Government require the passage of this bill,
or what modifications it ought to recene He
presumed the Senator would consent to a postpone-
ment of the matter for the present.
Mr BUCHANAN had no disposition to hutry
this bill, at the same time, if it were to pass at all,
it would be well if it passed speedily TUe amen l-
ment he had proposed to this bill did not vary it>
several principles in any respect, but it confined iheir
operation, in express teims, to the foreign States
and colonies conterminous with the United State .
The committee thought that the bill required thr 
amendment, otherwise it might possibly mteifere
with the general law which regulated our trade
with foreign nations If the SenatoV (Mr Rug-
gles) had any amendment to offer in reference to
Maiae, it would be as well to consider u now as at
any other tune    The committee, Mr B said, had.
