My cavalry have been unable to effect communication with General Burnside. Firing has been heard at Knoxville to-day, but not as heavy as yesterday. The enemy have blockaded the roads approaching from the north.

My present line is parallel with that of the enemy in front of the fort. I consider it a better position than the one previously held. It would be impossible for me to advance my line farther.
