firing them became general. In a short time the enemy was driven off Colonel Hamilton returned and I was ordered back, taking my position in front of the brigade, a position which I held for the most of the day. From that hour until 4 p. m. our position was frequently changed in order to meet the enemy in his various attacks upon that point, sometimes firing to the front, sometimes to the right or left.

At 4 p. m. our brigade fell back a few yards to allow General Branch and others to participate. At 5 p. m. my regiment was formed on the Fourteenth; ordered to load, fix bayonets, and charge the enemy if General Branch should fall back. He did not fall back, and we were ordered again to the position we occupied in the morning, the Fourteenth on my left and in the open field. Here and at that hour the battle raged most furiously in our front, though we were not participants. At twilight the enemy was repulsed and we bivouacked on the ground.

The conduct and bearing of my command in this engagement were all that could be desired. Soldiers could not have fought better than these did.

Report of the part taken by the Thirteenth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers in the battle of Manassas on August 30:

On the morning of August 30 our brigade was ordered back to a convenient point to draw provisions and replenish cartridge boxes. About 9 a. m. the brigade formed line of battle on the left of the position held on the day before, immediately in front of the unfinished railroad track and under fire of the sharpshooters of the enemy. My regiment occupied the extreme left. In this position we lay during the day without an engagement and bivouacked on the ground.

The casualties in my regiment were caused by the premature explosion of shells fired by our own batteries in rear.
