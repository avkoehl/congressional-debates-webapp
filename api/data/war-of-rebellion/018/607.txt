Nothing new up to present hour. Heintzelman is getting on well. All of Porter's corps will be under way before dark. No transports shall be left idle. Have been delayed by many vessels coming without water. Shall all go to Aquia?

Major General E. V. SUMNER,

Commanding Second Corps, Yorktown:

Please move to-morrow morning to Newport News with one of your divisions, marching the other to Hampton; your artillery to the latter place. The division destined for Newport News should move by Warwick Court-House and Young's Mill; the other by Big Bether. Divide the distance into two marches, reaching the destination day after tomorrow morning. It is probable that means will be ready for your troops to commence embarking the day after you reach here. I heard from Washington yesterday that Jackson was crossing the Rapidan.
