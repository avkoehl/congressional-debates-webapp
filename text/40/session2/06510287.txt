RECONSTRUCTION DEFICIENCY BILL.
Mr. BUTLER moved that the House resolve
itself into the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union on the special order.
The motion was agreed to ; and the House
accordingly resolved itself into the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union, Mr.
Maynard in the chair, and proceeded to the
consideration of the special order, being House
bill No. 326, making appropriations to supply
deficiencies in the appropriations for the exe-
cution of the reconstruction laws and for the
service of the quartermaster's department of
the Government for the fiscal year ending June
SO, 1868, and for other purposes.
The bill was read in extenso the first time
for information.
Mr. BOYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to a
question of order. I desire to ask the Chair
whether, in view of the great amount of ex-
penses incurred by this Government and likely
to be incurred by the existence of military ,
governments in the South, it would be in order
to introduce for the action of the House at this
time tbe resolution heretofore submitted tend- 1
ering the thanks of Congress to Major Gen-
eral Hancock for having asserted principles
and initiated action which if generally carried
out would be likely to lead to the speedy abo-
lition of military dictatorships, and in that way
lessen in future the enormous expenditures of
the Government, for which the bill just read in
part provides ? 1
The CHAIRMAN. That is not a question
of order.
_Mr. BUTLER. Mr. Chairman, in reporting
this bill to the House the committee have
authorized me to state that this bill covers
only a small part of the large estimates put
before them. And these items are reported
only because, in the judgment of the commit-
tee, they are necessary for the due execution
of the purposes of the Government.
I desire to call the attention of the commit-
tee to the first item :
To provide for the expenses of carrying into effect
the " Act to provide for the more efficient government
oi the rebel States."
I have caused to be prepared a table so that
the House may see exactly what has been
already expended under the reconstruction
acts and precisely what ia asked for and how
much is appropriated for the future, to the end
of the present fiscal year, June SO, 1868 :

It will be seen, sir—because it is but proper,
in my judgment, that this matter should be
thoroughly understood by the House—that
General Ord, in his district, composed of
Mississippi and Arkansas, has spent almost
as much as has been spent in the districts of
General Schofield, General Canby, and Gen-
eral Pope. There seems to be no apparent
reason for that extra expenditure ; but there
is within the knowledge of the committee, and
perhaps within the reach of Congress, no rem-
edy for this apparently extravagant expendi-
ture.
Mr. PHELPS. Let me ask the gentleman
a question at this point.
Mr. BUTLER. Certainly.
Mr. PHELPS. You have stated that the
amount in General Ord's district is equal to
three other districts. Now, I would like the
gentleman to inform the House the difference
between the total cost of General Sheridan's
district and that of General Ord.
Mr. BUTLER. The difference between
General Ord's and General Sheridan's expend-
iture is $458,000 for Ord, and $297,000 for
Sheridan, leaving out the odd numbers. What
is asked for by the succeeding general in the
fifth military district is $521,000. It is proper
to say that it is not asked for by General Han-
cock, and neither is it asked for by General
Sheridan.
This large expenditure, I was about to say,
cannot be controlled by the House or by
Congress; Che remedy is only within tbe reach
of the Executive; for this expenditure under
this general must go on, if the Executive so
elects, unless the House and the country
desire to abandon the greatest experiment of
bringing men to reason and restoring them to
to forfeited political powers by very gentle
means, greater than ever before undertaken in
the history of the world.
In the case of General Sheridan's district,
which is now General Hancock's district, it is
but fair to him to say that the largest amount
which he called for is for the pay of registrars.
While General Canby asked $36,000 and Gen-
eral Pope $50,000, General Sheridan's district
calls for $200,000 to pay the registrars of elec-
tion only. This large expenditure for registra-
tion happened in this way : After the registra-
tion of voters in that district was closed under
the act of Congress by the order of General
Sheridan, it was twice reopened under the
order of the President and extended for a very
considerable period of time. This makes one
controlling difference between General Ord's
and General Sheridan's necessary expend-
itures.
Another difference between the expenses
of General Ord's and the other departments
which the committee will appreciate was this:
General Ord kept the polls open one day in
his district, and had, therefore, only to pay
during so much time of the election, while in
the other districts the polls were kept open
three and in some places four and sometimes
five days.
The committee find, as far as reports have
been made to them, that the expenditures in tho
third district, that of General Pope, while it
has been one of the very largest districts,
including Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, and
while reconstruction under him is in a very
advanced stage of progress, hasbeen by far the
most economically managed. The Committea
of Ways and Means, knowing the great burdens
of taxation upon the people, have scaled these
appropriations to the lowest possible amount,
and we believe them to be only those that at e
necessary for the economical execution of the
work committed to the charge of the military
commanders of the several districts.
The next items are for deficiencies in tho
quartermaster's department, and an amount
of $13,500,000 was asked for by the estimates
of the Secretary of War. After two interviews
with the Quartermaster General we found that
it would be impossible consistently with due
regard to the public service to appropriate less
than $12,000,000. The reason of this deficiency
is this: last year there was no appropriation
made for the quartermaster's department. It
was supposed that the amount realized from
the sale of Government property rendered use-
less by the cessation of the war, received from
southern railroads and from other source's,
would enable the quartermaster's department
to go through the year without an appropria-
tion; but the Indian war supervened, throwing
very great expense upon the Quartermaster,
and especially upon the transportation branch
of the quartermaster's department. As yon
will see, the transportation item is 0",350,000
out of the $12,000,000. These appropriations,
therefore, seemed to be absolutely necessary,
and I will say that one reason why this bill is
reported thus early is that there is need of the
money this hour for Army purposes.
The next item is $2,000 for a deficiency in
the office of the chief of engineers for blank
books, stationery, and miscellaneous items.
And then there is an appropriation of $8,000
for the compensation of firemen and for the
replacing of the worn-out heating apparatus in
the building at the cornerof Pand Seventeenth
streets, which must be replaced as well for
economy as for the safety of the public docu-
ments which are in the office.
It will be seen, sir, that the committee have
cut down these items to the lowest possible
amount, and unless some gentleman desires
further to discuss this question I propose to a?k
that the committee rise and report the bill to
the House.
