AUGUSTA, ME., August 23, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We can be ready for the draft by September 3, but as State election is the succeeding Monday it will be exceedingly inconvenient. Wish time could be postponed a week or ten days.

I. WASHBURN, Jr.

BOSTON, August 23, 1862.

Brigadier General C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

New enrollment, making draft not possible to be correctly taken so soon. We are raising nine-months" men rapidly. Six more three- years" regiments will march this month if supplies ready for them. Delay the draft without fail. Troops are now and will continue raising faster than can be cared for.
