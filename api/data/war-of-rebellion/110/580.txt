HEADQUARTERS,Russellville, December 23, 1863.

Brigadier General R. B. VANCE,

Commanding:

By direction of Lieutenant General Longstreet I had the honor of communicating with you some days since, suggesting that you should take position at Newport as being a good point to cover your district and at the same time interrupt the enemy's foraging parties. The general suggested also that you should scout well toward Sevierville from that point. This position and course will do much to break up the enemy's foraging parties from Knoxville. I have not heard from you since my last letter, and now, by direction of General Longstreet, I have the honor to ask if you are prepared to carry out his suggestions. If so, please advise me as soon as possible.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
