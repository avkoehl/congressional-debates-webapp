Flag-Officer HOLLINS:

I have reason to believe that the enemy is preparing an attack on New Madrid. I desire you would stop three of the gunboats at that place for the purpose of supporting the land force in the contemplated attack.

General McCown will be in command so soon as his force can reach there.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I desire one of the gunboats to cruise up and down the river to keep the way open, and to that end have addressed a note to Commodore Whittle.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Columbus, Ky., February 26, 1862.

Colonel KENNEDY:

Your note by the Admiral received. I have caused the Simonds to be dispatched by telegraph from this place to come forward as rapidly as possible to you with the guns. I will send you some guns also from this place, together with an ample supply of ammunition. You must rush up the work night and day, and write me full particulars of your progress by every opportunity. I will have the guns manned as rapidly as you can get them up and as we can send the artillerists to you. Again I repeat you must push the work, but do not fail to do it in an orderly and effective manner.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Major-General, Commanding.
