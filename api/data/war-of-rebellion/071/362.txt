Colonel KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General

Will you be good enough to ask the general if it is still his purpose to order the Eighth Illinois Cavalry back to this department? I am very much in want of them to send to the upper Potomac.

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

Colonel W. GAMBLE,

Commanding Camp Stoneman:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that there are a number of rebel stragglers in the front of the line of defenses south of Eastern Branch. He directs, therefore, that you send a scout of cavalrymen, commanded by a competent officer, to examine that country carefully for full fifteen miles beyond the lines and pick up all such persons.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
