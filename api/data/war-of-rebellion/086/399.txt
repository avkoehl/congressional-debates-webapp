HEADQUARTERS NORTHWESTERN INDIAN EXPEDITION,Sioux City, November 1, 1864.

ASST. ADJT. General, DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST:

SIR: I have to report for the information of the general commanding that this night I received a letter from the post at Farm Island, from my adjutant-general, left there by me, dated 23rd October, who informs me that the friendly Indians I sent to the hostile camp had arrived about five days ago, and reported that the Uncpapas and Blackfeet would come in the make peace; that the Sans Arcs and Minneconjous had gone south, and that yesterday a large camp of Uncpapas came in, about 200 lodges. They wished me to vacate the posts up the country, as it drove off their buffalo. They acknowledged themselves badly whipped and wished peace. With those who have already come in, this makes 500 lodges. This shows the good results of the late expedition. The Indians can no longer boast, and with a little good management peace can be established.

With much respect, your obedient servant,

ALF. SULLY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS,Mouth of White River, Ark., November 2, 1864.

By order of Brigadier General E. S. Dennis:

RICHARD A. KENT,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., November 2, 1864.

Colonel W. F. GEIGER,

Commanding Third Brigadier, Cav. Div., Seventh Army Corps:

COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding wishes to know why the escort of 500 men ordered from you October 28, 1864, to proceed to Lewisburg and there await the arrival of Major-General Herron, were sent without rations or transportation. An informal report has been received by the general that the scout of 200 men ordered on the 26th day of October to proceed to Madison, on Saint Francis River, and return via Cotton Plant did not go to Madison. The general wishes to know if the information is true and orders that you make a full report of both affairs.*

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. E. GRAVES,

Captain, Twelfth Mich. Infty. Vet. Vols., and Acting Aide-de-Camp.
