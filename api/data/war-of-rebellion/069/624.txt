musketry. I do not deem it advisable to make any demonstration on my lines with artillery to-night, because it will interfere with the works which is doing in my front, and because it will keep my troops from much needed rest.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 5, 1864-3.30 a. m. (Received 4.05 a. m.)

General W. F. SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

I have sent instructions to General Willcox to relieve your brigade on your right. Will you please have the brigade commander send an officer to report to General Willcox soon after daylight, for the purpose of conducting the brigade into the position previous to the removal of your troops. General Willcox is at the Woody house.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 5, 1864.

General SMITH:

When we rode along the position I thought the troops in rear of it belonged to Birney's division, and did not learn differently until just as I was leaving. My orders only contemplated relieving Birney, but I was, nevertheless, willing to relieve your brigade had General Warren relieved one of my divisions to get here before dark, which they did not do. Is the right of your line to rest on the work which Major Morton is to build? If so, my left will rest there. Please inform me fully, and I will try to co-operate.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 5, 1864-8 a. m.

General W. F. SMITH:

Your dispatch received.* I have seen Major Morton and am quite satisfied with the arrangement. In telegraphing you, I was simply desirous of ascertaining where your right was to be on the new line after the brigade was relieved. You are quite right in not wishing to straddle the swamp. The ground was more familiar to you yesterday than to myself, and as I did not know there was a swamp there, neither did I know the direction of your line, and believing the Second Corps was in rear instead of the Eighteenth, I may be excused for troubling you so much. The line is being constructed from the left of our line proper to the swamp, and will be occupied by our troops.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
