The remains of Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry are here; I am collecting them, and will see they have forage and rations to-night, ready to move out on scout in morning. They report enemy in force at Bristoe, Gainesville, and Manassas. Train just fired 1 mile other side of Burke's Station. I find part of Cox's command under orders to take the cars. Will halt it with Franklin's until morning.

Will be up to see you in few minutes.

Captain SAWTELLE,

Fort Monroe:

Discharge all the large steamers as fast as you can; send them to New York. I am sending 5,000 new troops to Yorktown to-day. Couch's division is to come up at once. If you send up the animals rapidly can you not have forage enough or shall I send some to you? I wish to send as little as possible there. The batteries of Couch's division will accompany the division.

By command of Major-General McClellan:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
