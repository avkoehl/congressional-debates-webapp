indian affairs.
Mr. FOWLER. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill !
No. 557.
Mr. DOOLITTLE rose.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The morn-
ing hour is on the point of expiring, and the
unfinished business of yesterday will be in
order.
Mr. FOWLER. It will take but a few min<
utes to pass this bill. I do not desire to discuss
it at all.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I hope the Senator from
Tennessee will let the regular order come up,
and then, informally, I shall have no objection
to his occupying a few moments in the passage
of that bill; but I wish to go on with the reg-
ular order at one o'clock.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unfin-
ished business is the order of the day, and is
now before the Senate, being the bill (S. No.
204) to provide for an annual inspection into
Indian Affairs, and for other purposes, the
amendment of the House of Representatives
thereto being the pending question.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. President, I deem
this bill one of the most important, aside from
the great question of reconstruction, which has
been presented to the present Congress. I
believe that it involves the character of the
Government. I believe that it involves more
money, and if properly considered and acted
upon by Congress can save to this Govern-
ment more money, than any other legislation
that is now pending. I believe that our char-
acter as a nation is involved in it; and there-
fore Senators will excuse me if I speak with
earnestness, for I confess I feel very deeply the
importance of this measure.
For nearly ten years, by the pleasure of the
Senate, the responsibility of Indian affairs has
to a considerable extent been thrown upon
me. It has been a thankless task; a respon-
sibility which has brought labor without any
compensation. In the course of this long
period I think I have obtained some informa-
tion in relation to Indian affairs which I should
not have obtained as a matter of course had
I been engaged in the business mainly which
comes from the other committees of the
Senate.
In the views which are entertained by myself
on this subject I am sustained unanimously by
the Committee on Indian Affairs of this body,
unanimously also by the Committee on Indian
Affairs of the House of Representatives, and
unanimously sustained by the special com-
mittee raised by the two Houses, who were
instructed to inquire into and to report to Con-
gress what legislation was necessary to bring
about, if possible, a better administration of
Indian affairs.
Mr. President, in the examination of this
question I am not unaware of the difficulties
which exist in the proper administration of
Indian affairs. I agree with the honorable
Senator from Oregon, who is not now in his
seat, [Mr. Williams,] that there are difficulties
in relation to the administration of Indian affairs
which no law of Congress, no administration of
the laws of Congress can entirely remove.
They are difficulties which grow out of the
nature of the disease itself, irremediable, incur-
able, which grow, out of the contact of a
superior with an inferior race-; the one race
rushing onward to every Territory into all the
valleys and the mountain gorges all overthe vast
domain of the United States, which of necessity
brings in contact with the Indian tribes men of
the most hardy, adventurous, not to say some-
times the most reckless character in the world.
The contact of these people with the Indians
in pur Territories produces results which no
legislation can remove. Whichever way the
system is administered, whether by the War
Department or without the War Department,
there are diseases here and difficulties which
are beyond the power of man to remove. But,
sir, while it is impossible for us radically to
remove all these difficulties and to make a
perfect administration of Indian affairs, I do
insist that there is such a thing as ameliorating
these diseases, and it istoward the amelioration
of the system that we wish to direct the atten-
tion of Congress and to call the serious judg-
ment of Congress to it.
Sir, I know how difficult it is to get the ear
of Congress or the ear of the Senate on any-
thing which concerns our Indian relations.
Allow me, however, to state some facts. Does
my friend from Ohio [Mr. Sherman] know
that six thousand Indians under the War De-
partment in New Mexico cost us at the rate of
$1,500,000 a year just to feed and clothe them,
to say nothing about the expenses of the troops
which are required to keep them upon the
reservations and to keep the peace in Now
Mexico? Yes, sir, $1,500,000 expended to
feed and clothe six thousand Indians alone,
which appropriation is more than one half of
the whole Indian appropriations besides. I
ask gentlemen who sit around me here, who
ever heard about this expenditure by the War
Department? I ask the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, I ask the chairman
of the Committee on Finance, did he ever
know that the War Department were expend-
ing $1,500,000 annually merely to feed and
clothe six thousand Indians? Not one word
is said about that. No estimate is made for
it. How is it that this $1,500,000 given to
these six thousand Indians can pass through
Congress and nobody know anything about it?
Simply because it comes in the estimates for
the Army. You will vote $50,000,000 without
inquiring a word if it is only said to be neces-
sary for the Army. Transportation for the
Army, commissary supplies for the Army, pass
without question. But when you come to the
matter of appropriations for the Indian bureau
the estimates must be itemized and they must
present their claim, that we claim so much for
such a tribe of Indians, so much for another,
so much for carrying out a treaty with this
tribe of Indians or with that tribe of Indians,
and when these estimates are presented to Con-
gress, item after item, Congress can look into
them and make objections to them. The e
various items are to be passed on by the Com â€¢
mittee on Finance and by the Committee on
Indian Affairs. Our attention is arrested and
brought to them.
By reference to the speech of an honorable
gentleman of the House of Representatives on
the 1st of February last, I find he states that
the whole amount of the expenditures for the
Indian Bureau under the appropriation bill
was $2,408,050, and for transportation on that
sum $127,368 ; while the cost of providing by
the War Department for six thousand Indians
alone was $1,500,000. We ltnow nothing
about that. I know it is a very easy way to
dispose of these expenses in Indian affairs
to turn the matter over to the War Depart-
ment. It will then come in one grand item,
$50,000,000 at a time; there will be no dis-
cussion in Congress. It will be said, "Why
that is to support the Army ; that is to feed the
Army;" and no one will raise any objection
whatever.
But, Mr. President, this $2,500,000 which
is expended by the Indian Bureau in Indian
affairs is of very little importance compared
with the amount of expenditures which we
incur by the Indian wars which grow up on the
frontier ; and the question arises, What in the
best method of preventing Indian wars ? Is it
the best mode of preventing these Indian wars
to turn the whole of those tribes over to the
War Department and put them under the abso-
lute control of officers of the Army? That is
the question. Gentlemen sometimes say it is
this Indian system that gets up the Indian
wars. Mr. President, how little have these
gentlemen looked into the real facts ? I pro-
pose, in the few moments that I stand before
