HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, June 14, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,Richmond, Va.:

SIR: The force of the enemy mentioned in my last dispatch as being on the Long Bridge road disappeared during the night. It was probably advanced to cover the movement of the main body, most of which, as far as I can learn, crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and below, and has reached James River at Westover and Wilcox's Landing. A portion of General Grant's army, upon leaving our front at Cold Harbor, is reported to have proceeded to be White House and embarked at that place. Everything is said to have been removed, and the depot at the White House broken up. The cars, engine, railroad iron, and bridge timber that has been brought to that point have also been reshipped.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
