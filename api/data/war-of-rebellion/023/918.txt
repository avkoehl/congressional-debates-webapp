Brigadier-General FORREST,

Munfreesborough, Tenn.:

Have no cavalry equipments. Some 2,000 cavalry in department now for whom I have no arms. I have ordered Morgan's regiment and Gunter's squadron to La Vergne, McKinstry's regiment and Freeman's and Dure's batteries to Murfreesborough. Have about 6,000 stand of arms, which Bragg ordered me to send to Kirby Smith; General Maxey was going in charge of them. When did you leave General Bragg? Where was he? When and by what route did you send a courier to me? If you are sure that Bragg does not want the arms he ordered me to send to Kirby Smith by Maxey I will send a part of them to you.
