Numbers 3. Report of Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes, Twenty-third Ohio Infantry, commanding First Brigade, of engagement at Cloyd's Mountain.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, THIRD DIV., DEPT. OF W. VA.,Meadow Bluff, May 20, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to transmit herewith the reports of regimental commanders of my command of the part taken by their respective regiments in the battle of Cloyd's Mountains; also lists of casualties in that battle.*

As the commanding general was present with the brigade during the greater part of the action, it does not seem necessary to add anything to the reports of the regimental commanders.

I regret to have to report the loss of Capta. A. A. Hunter and First Lieutenant George N. Seaman, Twenty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, both of whom fell while gallantly leading their men against the enemy's intrenchments.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, &c.,

R. B. HAYES,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain J. L. BOTSFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
