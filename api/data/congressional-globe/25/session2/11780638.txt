ant cause, no doubi and leaving public monev s m the banks till
wanted, allows to merchants, in places oflarge import, a degree
oí inciden'al benefit, m just proportion to the amount of capital
by them employed m trade, and no more
I suppose, sir, it is t' e r atutal cuur&e of things m every com
mercial country, that some place, or a few places should go
ahead oi others 11 cummerual business* nnpottance This mubt
ever beso until all places pos&ess precisely equal nafuial id
vantages And I suppose, too, that, instead oí being mischie
vous, it is rather for ihe common good of ail, that theie should
be some commercial empouum, sorae central point, foi the ex-
changes of trade Government certain y, should not seek to
produce thib result by the bestowal of unupal privileges, out
surely, sir, it would be a very stiange and mdefeiiisib e po icy
which should lead the Government to withhold anv portion of
the capital of the country from useful employment, meieiy be
cause that, if employed, w! i!e all enjoyed the benefit pDpoi
uonately, all would not enjjy it with the same absolute mathc
matical equality
So much, sit, lot concentration an mg fiom deposit ng the
revenues m banks Let us now look to the othei pait oí the
connection, viz the rtcuvmg of bank notes for du íes How
in uhe woild does this "centralize53 the commercial ¡system"*
The whole tendency and effect, as it seems to me is dnectly
theotherway It counteract*, centralization It gives all possible
advantage to local currency and local payments, and thereby
ei courages both imports and expoits it terds to make local
money good everywhere If good  be imported i mo Charles
ton, the duties aie paid m Charleston n >tes New Y oik notes
are not demanded JSothmg, certainly, can be faner 01 mote
* qual than this, and nothing more favorab'e to the Chai^ton
jm poiters
But how would that system work, which the gentleman him
self proposed
If his plan could pievail, he would have the dut es collected
either in specie, or in a Government papei to be issued fiom
thcTieasury He would reject all bank notes whatevei II
the gentleman, «tr, feait. centralization, I am astonished thuhe
does not see cent alization m alt its tenois in this very piopisi
ti in of his own Piay allow me to ask Mr where will this
Government papei in the course of its issue and en dilation,
natuially centra 1 o what points will it tend"* Certainly most
certainly to the greatest points ot collection and expenditure
to the very heait of the Metropolitan city, wheiever thncity
may be This is at* inevitable as ihe fall of witei oi the re
suits of attiaction li two thuds of the duties be collected in
Isew Yoik it will follow of ourse, that two thirds, of a Go
veinment paper received foi duties wi!l be there leoeived, and
it will be moie valuaole there than e &ewheie The value of
such ( aper would consist in its re eivability, and nothing else
It would alwavs tend, theiefoie ditectiy to the spo where the
iteate&t demand should evist foi it foi that puipose Is it not ,

Such is the scheme of the honorable membei m i s pioba
ble commeioial effect I et us look at it m a political point of
view
The honorable membei says he belongs to the Sate lights

of iibeity an extraordinary sensibility to all its dangers an 1

calculation of th- csuntry, by notes or bills of us own issued
at its own üVcre'íon to be paid out or advanced to whom
soever it pleases m dischaiging tht. obligations of Government,
bearm^ no promise to pav, and to be kept in circulation
merely by being made i eceivable a t the Treasury ' The whole
circulation of the countiy, excepting onl> that which ¡s metal

mere Government papei, issue i foi Government nuiposes ard

the couitiv willbe hell by Government m its own hands and

and opnn )ns, the wh le commeinal business of the countiy

B it sir in older that I mij n >i mi represent the honorable
membei, let me show vou a utt t tioil distinctly what his opi

then lie says I go faithei If appeals to me, af u je¡>í owing
the best reflex ion I can gnethc subject, that no conveuiole j
paper than* n j paper whose cietut íests upon a.promit>e to j
pay-, is suitable ioi cunency ' On whet, then (he a<-kc)
ought a paper curiercy to lestV l[I would siv he ai ^-wet
"on demand and supply ¡nit pív which re^ul Ht the vaiue of

then  might be a sound and safe paptr currency lourdedonthe
ciedn of Government exciusiveij "That such papei, on'y
tobeissu°d to those who had claims on the Government, wou'd,
in its habitual state, be at or ar-ove par with gold and silver,"
that "nothing but experient¿ «afld>iter time what amount, and
of what cteaoBUBations, might be «afely  issuedj hut that it
might be safely assumed that the country would absorb an
amount greatly exceeding* its annual income Much of us ex
changes, which amount to a vaátsum, as well as its banking
business would revolve about it, and many millions would
thus be kept in circulation beyond the demands of the Govern
ment
By this scheme, sir, Government m lis disbursements, is n
to pay money but to issue paper This papei is no otherwi
payable or redeemable, than as it may he received at the Trea
sury It is expected to be let out much faster than it comes m,
so that many millions will be kept m c rcu ition, and lis habí
tual charactei will be at or above pai with gold and silver
í\ >w sn ii there is to be found any where a more p'am and ob
vious project of paper money, in all its defurmiiy, I should not
know where to look for it
In the first place, sir, I have suggested the complete union
which if would form, if it were, m itself, piacticable, between
the political and the money powe*-
The who'e commerce of the country indeed under such a
state of law, would belittle more than asort of incident to Trea
sury operations—rather a collateial era-nation of the revenue
system, than a substantial nd ímror'art biaicn of the public
interest I have referred, also, to its piobab* oonsequences,
upon that which the gentleman legaias a sogrea' an evil,'
and which he denominates " the centralization oi co-^rr^rcial
action "
And now I pray you to considei Mi Fres d^nt, m the rext
place what an admirable comuvauce th.a vjuli be to secuie
that economy in the expenses of Government which the gentle
man has so much at heart Released from all necessity of tax
ation, and fiom the consequent responstbili'y to the people, not
called upon toiegardatall the amount of am ual income, having
an ¿uthoiny to cause Treasury notes to issu* whenevei it
please*,
"In multitudes, like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loin , to pass
Khene, or the Danau,"
what admirable restraint would be imposed on Government,
how doubiy sine would assurance he made for it, that all *tsex
pcnditurts would be strictly limited to the absolute and indis
pensable wants and demands of the public service'
But, sn fortunately, very fortunately, a scheme so wild, and
which would be «¡o mischievous, is totally impracticable It
resfs on an assumption, ioi which there is not the least founda
Uon, eithei in reason oi experience It takes foi granted that
whifh thehistoiy of e\ery commercial State refutes, and our
own e peciallv, in almost eve]ypat,e It supposes that irre
deemable Government papti can cue ila e m the ousiness of «o
ciety, and be kept at par This is an impossibility The hono
rablt gentleman rejects (onvertible bank notes which are equi
valentto specip since they will alwajs command it ana adopts
in their stead Government paper with no promise to pa\, but a
promise only to be received lor debts and taxes, and 'ie puts
forth ¡he imagination as Iha\ebaid,so often and so long refuted,
that this paper will be kept in circulation in the countiy and
will be able to perform the great husmeas ofcuirency and ex
change, even though it exist m quantities exceeding, by many
miiliors thedemand  ofGovernment
If it be neceosaiy, sir at this day, to refute ideas like these, it
mus be tecduse the history of all counuies, our own included,
1-d a dead letter to us Even at t e ver} moment in which I a i
speaking (he email am unt of Treasury notes which has been
issued by Government, hardly a fifth part of the ordinary an
nual revenue—though those notes bear an interest of five per
c n —though they are redeemable in ^ash at the Treasury af
the expiration of the year—and though in the mean time, they
are every where received m Government duei- are not only of
less value taan specie but of lesb value also, han the notes of
non specie paying ba k% those banks wh se paper is daily de
nounced here as "rags—filthy raes In my opinion, Mr, t e
whole scheme is as visionary and impracticable as any which
the genms of project ever produced
Mi President, toward the close of this speech of September I
find a paragraph m which sev ral other subjects arc brought to
gcther and which I must ask pet mission to read
Ha\mg commended the wise an 1 noble bearing of the little
«tate Rights paity, of which he «aj s it is hi pi ide to be a mem
ber thr ughout tli eventful periot1 through which tht- countiy
has pas ed since 1824 he adds
' in that yea , as I have stated, the tariff system triumphed m
thecouncils ofthe nation We saw its disastious political bear
mgs, foresaw its surpluses and the extravagancies to w ich it
would lead we tallied on the election of the late President toar
rest it throuyi the influence ofthe Executive Department ofthe
Government In this we failed We then fell back upon the
rights and sovereignty of the States, and bytbeactioi of a small
but gallant fe(ate and through the potencv of its mterposi'Km,
webiought. the system to the giound sustained, as it was, by the
Opposition and the Administration, and by the whole po^serand
patronage of the Government "
Every part of this most extraordinary statement well deserves
attention
In the first place, sir, here is an open and direct avowal that
the mam object for rallying on General Jackson's fhsv election
was to accomplish the overthrow of the ptoteumg pohcy of
the countiy Irdeed1 Well this is ver; i rank I am glad to
hear the avowal nade     It puts an end to sllsu picion*:
if was then tooveithiow piotection wa>- it that ihe honora
b'e gentleman took eo much pains to secure Gen Jaek-=oi s
fits election? I commend his candor in now acknowledging it

Thepresent Chief Magistrate oí the country was a member
ef this body m 1828.    He and the honorable member from Ca*
rolina were, at that time, exerting their united forces, to tÜe ut-
most, m order to bring about Gen Jaeksoa's election. Djtd

and purpose? or did they mean merely uj change the Gov&m-
ment, and then each to look out for himsein
Mr Van Buren voted for the tariff bi!i of thatyear, common
ly called the * bill of abominatioaeí" but, very luekijy, aod m
extremely good season znstruútíonn for that rote happened to
come from Albany' The rote, therefore, could fee given* ajid
the member givmg It could not possibly thereby give any oí
fence to any gentleman of the State Rights party, with wiiom
the doctrine of instructions is so authentic
Sir, I will not do gentlemen injustice    Those who belonged
t& tariff States, as they are called, and who supported General
Jackson for the Presidency, did not intend thereby to overrhrow
the protecting policy    They only meant to make Gen Jwtftsoti
President, and to come mto power along with hira*   As to aln
mate objects, each had his own     Ail could agree, however, xn
the first step     It was difficult, certainly, to give a plausible ap
pearance to a poll icai umen, among gentlemen who differed so
widely, on the great and leading question of the times—the
question of the protecting policy    Butthisdifficuity was over
come by the oracular declaration that Gen Jackson was m la
vorof a "Judicious Tariff s
Here, sir, was ample room and verge enough Who could
object to a judicious ta,riff7 Tariff men and anti Tariff man,
State Rights men and Consohdationists, those who had been
called piodigals, and those who had been called radicals, all
thronged and flocked together here, and with ail theirdiffe-
rencVmresaid to ultimate objects, agreed to make common
cause, till tbey shouldgetmto power
The ghjsts, sir which are fabled to cross the Styx, whatever
different hopes or purposes they may have beyond it, still unite,
in the present wish to get over, and therefore ail hurry ana
huddle into the leaky and shattered craft of Charon, the ferry
man And thi^ motley throng of poli icians, sir, with as much
difference of final object, and aa little care for each o*her, made
a boat of ' Judicious Tariff," and ail rushed and scrambled into
it, until they filled it, rear to sinking The authority of the
master was able, however, to keep them peaceable and in or
der, for the time, for they had the virtue of submission, and
though with occasional dangers of upsetting, he succeeded to
pushing them all over with his long setting pole
"Ratem conto subigu "
Well, sir, the honorable gentleman teiisua that he expected,
when General Jackson should be elected, to arrest the tariff
system through the influence of the JSsecuhte department
Here is another candid confession Airest thetartffby Execu
live influence ' Indeed ' Why, sir, this seems like lisping,
from the fir-it, for the we of the veto How, but by the veto*
could the Executive airest the tariff acts T And is it true, sir,
that, n that earlv day, the honorable member was lookmgi 
the veio, not with draad, but with hope 1 Did he expect it,
and did he reply upon it? Did he make the rally of which he
speaks, m order that he might choose a President who would
exercise it? And did he afterwards complain of it, or does he
eomplain of it now, only because it was ill directed—because it
turned out to be a thunderbolt, which did not fall la the right
place?
In this reliance on Executive influence—sir, I declare I hard
ly can trust myself that I read or quote correctly, when Ifind,
m what I read, or from what I quote, the honoroble member
from South Carolina, by his own confession, hopmsr or expect
mg to accomplish any thing by Executivemfiuence, yet so was
it spoken, and so is it prin'ed—in this reliance, orthis hope, or
expectation founded on Executive influence, the honorable
gentleman and his friends failed and, failing m this, he says,
they fell back oathe sovereignty of the States, and brought the
system to the ground " thiough the potency of int^rposfiien , '
by whick he means neithei more nor less thaa Nullification
S -> then sir according to this that excessive fear Of power
which was so much cherished by the Nullifiers, was only awa
kened 'o a flame m their bosoms, when they found thattfeey
could not accomplish their ow n ends by the Executive power
of the President
I am no authorized commentator, sir, on the doctrines or the
ouet, of'nullification Ntmnostrum But, if this exposition
he authentic, T must say it is not calculated to diminish ray op-
position to the sentiments of that school
But the gentleman goes on to tell ms that nullification, or hi
terposttion, succeeded By means of it, he says, he did bnft^
the protective system to tha ground And so, m his publlshsa
letter of November 3d he stages that "Sate interposition has
overthtown the piotective tariff and with it, tbe Asftencai
system "
We are to understand, then, sir first, that the compromise act
of 16^3 was forced upon Congress by State interpos.tion, ov
nullification
Next, that its object and design, so far as the honorable gen
tleman was concerned in it, was to bereak dewrt and jáestroyj
forever, the whole protective policy of tha country
And lastly, that it has accomplished that purpose, and that
the last vestige of that policy is weanrgaway
INow, sir I must say, that in 1833,1 entertained no doubt at
all that the design of the gentleman was exactly what fee now
states On this point I have not been deceived It wasnof,
certainly the design of al5 who acted with him, but, that it was
his purpn«e, I knew then as cleailvas 1 know now,after his
open avowal of it and thwbelief governed my conduct at the
t rne together with that of a gieai majority of tho-'e m both
¡ieiteesof Coneress, who, after the act of 3824, felt bound to
carry out the provisions of that act and to maintain them rea
sonably and fairly I opposed the compromise act with alimv
power It appealed to i>e every way ohjectionabu, u looked
like an attempt to make a new Constitution , to introduce
a lother fundamental law, above the power of Congress, and
which should control the authoritv and discretion of Congress,
in all time to come This, ot itself, was a conclusive objec
tion with me, I «aid so then have often paid so mnce, and eay
"o now I «aid, then that I for one, should not be bouivd by
tl at law more than bv any other law, except that, as it was a
Jaw parsed on a very important and aeitatmg pubject)Isb<i'uld
not be disposed to interfere with rt, nnnla case of clear necessity
should an*e On this principie I have at. ed since When
that case of necessity shall arise, however, should I be m p^ab
he life I shall concur in arsy alteration of that act which such
necessity may require That such an occasion may come I
more than fear I entertain somethingsimngertban adeubte$on
the possibility of maintaining the manufactures and industry of
this country, upon such a system as the compromise act will
leave us, when it shall have gone ihKHiglbiisi&waaBesof re*
gucta.   All this, however, I leave to th* future.
