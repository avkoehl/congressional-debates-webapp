property of the railroad company at that place. The remainder of the detachment will be stationed at Macon to guard the Government property at that station. After the troops shall have been stationed as above directed Captain Tilson will notify the commanding officer of the Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia and the commanding officer of the detachment of the Thirty-ninth Missouri Volunteers of the fact, that they may move their respective commands to Saint Louis as ordered from department headquarters. The quartermaster's department will furnish transportation.

Major Fiftieth Missouri Volunteers and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General

CAMP MITCHELL, June 29, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I will not require troops to replace the Third United States. The Sixth will be sufficient for this side of the mountains after my campaign. I am taking four companies of the Sixth with me to guard trains and depots between Laramie and Powder River. Will not require them for that duty after campaign. The Third will not re-enlist. The three infantry regiments and Tibbits' brigade will, I suppose, have to do for Utah. How many men in Tibbits' brigade? General Heath telegraphs me that he is much embarrassed by Colonel Cole's conduct. Will You please telegraph to Washington to have Heath assigned, if not already so?

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General.

CAMP MITCHELL, June 29, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Colonel Cole raises a question of rank with General Heath. Has the latter been assigned to duty by the President in his brevet grade? I will reach Laramie day after to-morrow. I am traveling with the horses, as I do not want to lose them. All is quiet in the district.

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MITCHELL, DAK. TER., June 29, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

General Heath telegraphed to-day that commissary stores had not all arrived, and horses and mules were being shod. I have been much annoyed at the delay and have been hurrying them. Colonel Cole will command the expedition. I do not wish the battalion of Twelfth Missouri to accompany expedition, unless it should be ready when the column passes Columbus.

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General.
