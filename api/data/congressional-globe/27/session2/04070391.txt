piedtcated on a certain corre^pendei ce between the Governor
of he StateofGeorg a and the Department of War, which had
resulted in a request of the Governor to withdraw the regular
tioops fiom Georgia andthedeclaiation on the part of the Oa
vei nor that he had taken the defence of Georgia into his own
hands An appropriation therefore was asked to support a
small militia force aftera ommittee ¡should first have exam
med the subject an 1 detei mined whether the exigency wassuch
as to justify that appropriation
Mr W after pJintmg out more particularly the marked dif
feience which, he said, exit-ted between his own proposition
and that of his colleague, sent to the chair a letter from the Go
vernor of Georgia to the delegation m Congress from that State,
an 1 a letter from the Governor to the Secretary of War, which
were read
Mr W had he sai I, another letter m his pissession, fully
j istifying the necessity of the couise but seeing that the
House was impatient he would not ask for the readisg of it
And forthe purpose of bringing the mattertoaclo^e h moved
the previous question
Mr BLVCK hoped the House would hear read the papers
coming from citizens of Georgia
Oojpction was made
Mi WaRREN1 said his resolutions covered all the cocu
■mfmts
Mr BLACK and Mr M A COOPER appealed to Mt War
een to with haw the demand for the previous question
Mr WARREN declined so to do
And the question being taken on the demand for the previous
question ihere was a second
Mr ANDREW  of Kentucky moved to lay the whole sub
j ect on the table
Which motion, by ayes 51, noes not counted, was rejected
The question then recurred on orlenng the mam question,
(being on the adoption of the resolution,) and it was oidured to
be now taken
Mr ADAMS moved to amend the resolution by striking out
the full >\vmg words
'Anl that the letter of the Governor of Georgia with the ac
co npanymg d >cuments a3k 02 the Géofgia delegation to have
