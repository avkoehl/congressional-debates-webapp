Mr. FARNSWORTH.' Mr. Clerk, as I an-
nounced yesterday morning, and as I have stated
repeatedly, I will very cheerfully give way, if it
be the disposition of the House, to proceed to a
ballot for Speaker. But I wish to say in this
connection that in giving way to such a motion,
if it be the disposition of any gentleman to make
it, I am not to be understood as giving way for
other gentlemen to occupy the floor.
