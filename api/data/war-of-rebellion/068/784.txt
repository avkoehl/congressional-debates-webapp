RIFLE-PITS, May 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General MOTT,

Commanding Third Brigadier, Third Div., Second Corps:

GENERAL: It will be impossible to hold this line longer if the enemy continue their enfilading fire. The men are compelled to be perfectly quiet, while numbers of them are being mangled. Lieutenant Bladwin was just killed by a solid shot. The right has fallen back up to the point occupied by the Fifth and Eleventh New Jersey.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. McALLISTER,

Colonel Eleventh New Jersey Volunteers.
