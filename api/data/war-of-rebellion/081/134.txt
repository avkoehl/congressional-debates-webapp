HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 17, 1864-11.20 p.m.

General WILLIAMS:

I have relieved all that portion of the line formerly occupied by Brooks' division, Eighteenth Army Corps, and to the best of my belief this was all Major General W. F. Smith excepted me to do. At any rate, my whole force is now in the intrenchments and on the picket-line, with the exception of one small brigade covering a gap of nearly a mile between Martindale's left and my right.

Very respectfully,

THOS. H. NEILL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Division.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 17, 1864-3.15 a.m.

One of my divisions is formed ready to attack. Please let me know as soon as possible whether it is to attack now or to go to General Smith.
