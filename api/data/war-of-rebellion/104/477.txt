LOUISVILLE, KY., April 26, 1865.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

Officers will retain side-arms and afterward [be] treated liberally. Do as you think proper in regard to men paroled. Your idea of duplicate rolls correct.

JOHN M. P[ALMER].

LEXINGTON, KY., April 26, 1865.

Major-General PALMER,

Louisville, Ky.:

The rebels will accept the propositions, except that they want to keep the horses of officers and men, which they claim as private property.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, April 26, 1865.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

The condition of retaining horses is inadmissible. I am willing to be liberal to officers after surrender, but the horses must be surrendered and then disposed of as may be right.

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., April 26, 1865.

Major-General PALMER,

Louisville, Ky.:

Am sending all of my available force to Mount Sterling. The Fifty-fifth (mounted) Infantry will move from Covington, two companies of Fifth Cavalry, dismounted, from Paris. One hundred and twenty-five men, One hundred and twenty-first Colored, will arrive at Mount Sterling to-morrow. All posts have been notified. Thirty-ninth Kentucky serving on Big Sandy have been ordered to get in rear of rebels. Negotiations will end to-morrow. Will advise you as to events.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

Is there not danger that they will capture our troops there?

P[ALMER].

LEXINGTON, KY., April 26, 1865.

Major-General PALMER,

Louisville, Ky.:

Not as long as we are negotiating. I send immediately all the available force I had. By noon will have five mounted companies and two infantry and one artillery there, and two others by night, mounted. When all arrived will be 600.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
