Major-General GRANT:

Colonel Whiting, commanding at Warrenton, reports General Johnston, with 3,000 or 4,000 men, building a bridge across Big Black, from 12 to 20 miles off. My cavalry are now reconnoitering toward Baldwin's and Hall's [ferries.] I have no corroboration of the report. Will send word to Lauman. A gunboat should watch Warrenton.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief

Spy in Corinth left Atlanta on May 8. Stopped five days in Chattanooga. Saw Streight at Atlanta. His ammunition gave out. Government stores removed from Atlanta. While he was in Chattanooga seven brigades passed on their way south. Two days afterward, at Stevenson, other troops passed south-all from Bragg's army, they say-bound to Vicksburg. Rome is being fortified. He thinks none of the troops seen stopped at Rome. This city (Memphis) is full of rumors of disaster to General Grant.

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., May 21, 1863.

Rear-Admiral DAVID D. PORTER, Comdg. Mississippi Squadron:

I expect to assault the city at 10 a. m. to-morrow. I would request, and earnestly request it, that you send up the gunboats below the city and shell the rebel intrenchments until that hour and for thirty minutes after. If the mortars could all be sent down to near the point on the Louisiana shore, and throw in shells during the night, it would materially aid me. I would like at least to have the enemy kept annoyed during the night.
