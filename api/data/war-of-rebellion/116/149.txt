General BENJAMIN HUGER,

Commanding Department of Norfolk, Norfolk, Va.

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that this Department has received from General Wool at Fortress Monroe a packet relative to the recent trial of pirates at Philadelphia. This packet has the following address:

to the Honorable Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, Richmond, Va.

It appears from a copy of a letter in the packet from J. Hubley Ashton, assistant U. S. attorney at Philadelphia, to Commodore Pendergrast that the commodore was requested to transmit the packet to Fortress Monroe to be forwarded, and it is presumed that he complied with the request.

If he did in my judgment he committed an indiscretion which should receive a proper rebuke from the Navy Department.

I have the honor to be, sir, you obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
