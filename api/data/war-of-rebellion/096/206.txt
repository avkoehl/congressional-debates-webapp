CITY POINT, VA., January 23, 1865.

Honorable HENRY WILSON,

Chairman Committee on Miliary Affairs:

I see that General Thomas and Sheridan have been confirmed as major-generals in the Regular Army, whilst no mention is made of General Meade's confirmation to the same rank. From this I infer objections have been raised. This I regret. General Meade was appointed at my solicitation, after a campaign the most protracted and covering more severely contested battles than any of which we have an account in history. I have been with General Meade during the whole campaign, and not only made the recommendation upon a conviction that this recognition of his services was fully won, but that he was eminently qualified for the command such rank would entitle him to. I know General Meade well. What the objections to his confirmation are I do not know; did I know I would address myself directly to these objection.

Hoping that your honorable body consider this case favorably, I subscribe myself, with great respect,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 23, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Saturday's Richmond Examiner states positively that Mr. Seddon, Secretary of War, has resigned, and if any nomination has been made of his successor it has not yet been acted on. There is nothing at the War Department of Sherman's movements later than already reported. General Hardee telegraphed Thursday to the Department that there was nothing of interest to communicate.
