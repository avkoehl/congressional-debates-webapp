Adequate forces were reserved in the Department of Washington, under Major-General Augur, to protect the capital and the immense depots of military supplies at Washington and Alexandria, and also in the Middle Military Department, under Major General Lewis Wallace, to cover Baltimore and the important lines of supply and communication in that department. Besides the armies operating actively in the field, troops were assigned to garrison exposed and important strategic points, to guard hospitals, recruiting stations, prison camps, supply depots, railroad lines, and to defend border States and the northern frontier from rebel raids.

In the Department of the South a force was operating against Charleston and in Florida, under General Gillmore.

West of the Mississippi the forces were under the respective departmental commanders. In the Department of the Gulf, embracing Louisiana and Texas, Major-General Banks had his headquarters at New Orleans. The Department of Arkansas was in command of Major- General Steele. Major-General Curtis commanded the troops assigned for the Department of Kansas and the Indian Territory. The troops in the Department of the Missouri were under command of Major-General Rosecrans. The defense of the Northwestern States and Territories against Indians, expeditions to check incursions and reduce hostile tribes, and to protect the overland route to California employed a considerable force under Major- General Pope in the Northwest Department, General Carleton in New Mexico and Arizona, and General Connor in the Indian Territory. The States and Territories on the Pacific Coast required but a small force, under Major-General McDowell.

The headquarters of the lieutenant-general commanding all the armies were with the Army of the Potomac in the field.
