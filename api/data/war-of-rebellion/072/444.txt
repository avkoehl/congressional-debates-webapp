and on the 2nd to Lovejoy's Station, where the battalion remained till the night of the 5th, when it joined in the retrograde movement to Atlanta, which place it reached on the 8th instant. But few casualties occurred during this movement, as the battalion was at no time engaged.

My thanks are due to Lieutenant-Colonel Bowman, commanding the Ninety-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, for the able manner in which he handled his regiment; and I desire to make honorable mention of the subordinate officers of his regiment, as well as those of the One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, all of whom did their duty most gallantly from first to last.

Accompanying this report I send a list of casualties, to which I call the general's especial attention.

I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

O. H. PAYNE,

Colonel 124th Ohio Volunteer Infantry.

Captain JOHN CROWELL, Jr.,

Asst. Adjt. General, 2nd Brigadier, 3rd Div., 4th Army Corps.
