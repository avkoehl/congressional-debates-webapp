THE CONGRESSIONAL GL0B8.

enslaved, ignorant nations of the Old World
put. on the shackles which Adam Smith or
Uicurdo had found were fitted and worn into
the flesh of tlve subjects and slaves of a thou-
sand years of tyranny, and expected them to
!ii us and bold us. They undertook to meas-
ure i be man who earns, buys, builds, creates a
comfortable home, or even a splendid one, with
the man who works as his father did and his
fain r.V fathers have done for ten generations
past, in the colliery or as a farm servant, with-
out in all that time the accumulation of a dol-
lar; who lives in a land where thirty thousand
men hold the soil on which twenty millions live,
and the number of whose landholders has
diminished two thirds in one hundred and fifty
years; a land in which labor is but thirty to
fifty cents a day; where starvation stands at
the door of the laborer, and the workhouse is
almost, his certain doom in sickness and old
age; where the free school sheds no light upon
childhood, and an odious system of church
aristocracy degrades the holy ordinances of
religion ; where the working and middle classes
pay live sevenths of the taxes, while the landed
aristocracy pay but two sevenths, thus exhaust-
ing and impoverishing the yeomen year after
year, placing them in the grasp of greedy land-
lords, and reducing them to the condition of
serfs. How different from our own condition!
Wo find no parallels upon which to base our
theories of political economy. In no nation
but ours has it bi-en possible for one set of
men to push out, build mills, bridges, roads,
railways, hotels, factories, and cities, and,
failing utterly, to be succeeded at once, like
the second line of a storming party, by another
throng of men, fresh, daring, and strong, who
seize these enterprises, and out of their wreck
and ruin build colossal fortunes, run the ma-
chinery, people the waste places, and make
them centers of businessandprosperity. Where
else is failure the herald and forerunner of suc-
cess? Where else are great cities built upon
a soil shingled with mortgages drawing enor-
mous rates of interest? Where before ever
did the world behold so much financial success
founded upon so much financial ruiu?
Looking at the growth of the country, and
the consequent increase of business, the natu-
ral conclusion is that we need an expansion
instead of a contraction of the currency. The
demand for labor, the supply of labor, the
products of labor are increasing, capital is in-
creasing ; why should not their representative
in value? The demand for capital seems so
far to be unlimited. We are not situated as
Florence, Venice, Palermo, Alexandria, and
Genoa, were, with a surplus upon which to do
banking business or to expend upon the erec-
tion of gorgeous palaces, splendid churches,
fountains, sta uary, pictures, glittering equi-
pages, gems, jewelry, ornaments, dress, and
luxurious living. Our great houses are hotels
or places of business; our aqueducts bring
water for the poor to drink and use or to^
turn the bnsy wheel. Our annual outlay of
millions is for the comfort of the people, for
great charities, for education, for use, for
help, for light. A few localities as such may
approach the banker condition. Hartford,
Providence, Boston, New Bedford have large
accumulations, but New England is still a
workshop, not. a loan office While we in the
West are satisfied with full rations, a shelter-
ing roof, plenty of work, and plenty of money
at ten per ceut., Yankee enterprise finds every
day ready outlay for the previous day's accu-
mulations, and that, too, in permanent invest-
ments that secure and give employment to
industrious hands.
So far Yankee wealth has been devoted
mainly to the great charities, to the great edu-
cators of man, to the great uses of life, and
not in erecting idle pyramids ordrowsy tow-
ers or unthrifty chateaus or luxurious palaces,
yielding only profit to the builder, and taxing
all his descendants for their repairs, tenantry,
and support. Here interest is at. an enormous
rate. Capital being scarce, labor rushes for
it to secure its help in lifting business and
developing trade, while the Old World will-
ingly pays but from two to three per cent.
it is safe to say, then, in view of all our
experience, that we cannot be governed as to
the management of our currency and debt by
measures and a policy which have proved wise
and successful in countries of slow growth, of
little activity, of greater capital and less enter-
prise. And yet, as before remarked, we have far
less currency to the individual than our Eng-
lish and French neighbors; the former having
about twenty-six and the latter about thirty
dollars, paper and metallic, to the head. At
English rates, if we were paying specie, we
would have about eight hundred millions, and
according to French rates near eleven hun-
dred million dollars in circulation, instead of
six hundred and seventy millions, a large part
of it lying as a reserve in bank vaults. Busi-
ness demands an enlarged volume of our cur-
rency, and the difficulty of the case is not upon
this point, but upon the methods to be adopted
to give it an increased value and bring it to par.
One word upon the subject of expansion and
the mere volume of currency. For more than
a thousand years previous to the discovery of
America the precious metals became scarcer.
The New World furnished a vast supply—the
robbery of Mexico and Peru, and the opening
of their mines threw a flood of gold and sil-
ver upon the world ; the result was an unpar-
alleled activity in business everywhere. This
supply was continued up till the year 1S09,
when it continued falling off till 184(X Com-
mercial distress ensued only to be relieved by
the opening of the Russian, California!), and
Australian mines. The volume of the woild's
currency was increased and prosperity followed;
diminished, and everything languished.
A glance at the prices of gold for the last six
years, covering the period of our greatest in-
flations of paper currency from their beginning
to the present time will show at the outset the
inherent difficulty in legislating so as to give to
specie or paper a permanent and fixed value.
From these it will be seen that at the periods
of the greatest expansion, in 18G5 and lbGO,
gold was selling at a lower rate than when paper
was hundreds of millions of dollars less abun-
dant.
The following tables show the course of the
gold market for the past six years:

Will the simple declaration that a paper dol-
lar is as good as a gold dollar; will writing
the word ''resumed " over the Treasury door
effect anything? That declaration was made
gold for greenbacks have any effect? Surely
not, unless it is followed by the fact and the
gold goes out. And how long would it take to
exhaust the stoie there when gold is at a pre-
mium of thirty-five cents? How long would
it take three hundred and fifty-six millions to
swallow ninety ? Who could or would forbear
to make the profit? Three months would not
elapse till every gold dollar had been drawn
from the Treasury.
But aside from this, the effect of a return to
specie payments, were it feasible, would be to
inflict suffering on the many, while a few would
be benefited. The difficulties of conducting
trade, the heavy weight of all debts, mort-
gages, and contracts for money, would be made
more oppressive, with taxes now become more
burdensome. The effect of a diminution of
the currency depopulated great provinces in
imperial Home, and recently in England, from
1810 to 1830, and created great distress. J ust
so does the increase of trade and population
