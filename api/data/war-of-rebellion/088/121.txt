Brigadier-General RAMSAY,

Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army,

Winder's Building, Washington, D. C.:

I have sixteen Coehorns in position and could fire 1,000 rounds daily to advantage. My supply of this ammunition is nearly exhausted, although it has been economized to our serious detriment, the rebel mortar fire now exceeding our own. In response to my letter of 15th instant and telegram of 19th instant, I have only received about 1,700 rounds. If possible I urgently request a prompt filling of the requisitions for 20,000 rounds, with preparations for a further supply if called for.

He says 3,000 - I think the 400 or 500 I spoke to you about yesterday. I sent out thirty or forty cavalry to repair the telegraph line this a. m., but they were driven in. What shall I do?

At 3 p. m. I sent the following to Colonel Innis:

Keep a sharp lookout, but don't risk surprise or capture.

Deeming it important to destroy or capture the rebel force that was interrupting the telegraph at 3.45 p. m. I telegraphed to Captain Pit-
