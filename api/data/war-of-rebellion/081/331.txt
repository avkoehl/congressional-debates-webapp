the same force that now opposes us. With my present force I feel perfectly safe against Lee's army, and, acting defensively, would still feel so against Lee and Johnston combined; but we want to act offensively. In my opinion, to do this effectively, we should concentrate our whole energy against the two principal armies of the enemy. In other words, nothing should be attempted, except in Georgia and here, that is not directly in co-operation with these moves. West of the Mississippi I would not attempt anything until the rebellion east of it is entirely subdued. I would then direct Canby to leave Smith unmolested where he is; to make no move except such as is necessary to protect what he now holds. All the troops he can spare should be sent here at once. In my opinion the white troops of the Nineteenth Corps can all come, together with many of the colored troops. I wish you would place this matter before the Secretary of War and urge that no offensive operations west of the Mississippi be allowed to commence until matters here are settled. Send the Nineteenth Corps and such other troops as you can from the Department of the Gulf to me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General MEADE:

I wish you would send two companies of engineers to Smith's front to establish mortar batteries. If you are not using the Coehorns with mortar batteries. If you are not using the Coehorns with the Army of the Potomac please send them also. Our siege train has not yet arrived. On the 19th I received a dispatch from Washington saying that the last vessel having this train on board sailed that afternoon. I have sent Comstock to look it up and hurry it up.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 23, 1864-7.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The lines of the Sixth and Second Corps were advanced at daylight. The Sixth Corps found no enemy in their front. The Second Corps found none on their left, but met a strong skirmish line on the right center and right. This has been forced back and the right of the corps occupies the line which was occupied yesterday. The whole line is advancing and swinging on the right of the Second Corps,, which is close up to the main line of the enemy on the Jerusalem plank road. I shall continue to advance and develop the enemy's position, but the process will be long and tedious, arising first from the nature of the country,
