CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
was carried on by meo leg-slating to get themselves
libraries out of the public Treasury. This was a
fraud on the Treasury, and these publishers knew it
at the time the act was passed, as well as he did
They knew that the Constitution gave members of
Congress no right to supply themselves with books
at the public expense, and, therefore, in carrying
on this work, they did it with their eyes open, at
their own risk If there was any thing due these
men in point of law, he was willing to pay for it;
bat he could not agree to the principle advanced
by his friend from Alabama, that they were bound
to pay, because there had been & combination to
cheat the Government.
Mr. BUCHANAN observed that he was as
anxious to get clear of this contract as any other
man; bnt at the same time he was anxious that
Congress should get clear of it by dome what he
conceived to be justice and equity on their part.
Now, it could not be denied, because the recorded
evidence was before them, that this contract was
entered into with these individuals under an ex-
press act of Congress; and it was loo late now for
them to say, with the honorable Senator lrona
Ohio, that the Congress of the United States had
bo nght to pass such a law. He should not enter
into the constitutional question, but it certainly
would not be fair, after the expense had been ac-
tually incurred by these individuals under the con-
tract, to refuse payment upon the plea, whether
well or ill founded, that we had no right to autho-
rize the Secretary of Stale to make such a contract.
In this case he bad no doubt tbat Mr. Livingston
altogether misapprehended the extent of the obli-
gation he was incurring, and indeed he presumed
that no member of Congress, at the tim?, had any
idea that the contract would ever involve any
thing like the amount of expense that they now
saw it would. Nevertheless, they had got them-
selves into the difficulty, and how they were to get
out of it was the question? By raising a legal
question? No; but by pursuing the course that
had been pointed out by the Senator from New
Hampshire and the Senator from Alabama.
Let us (continued Mr. B.) pay them fairly—let
us give them a just indemnity for the expenses
they have incurred and the labor they have per-
formed. He would not go to the extent of
the profits they might imagined themselves en-
titled to, but he was for giving them a fair and
even liberal indemnity For his own part he had
felt rather inclined, as they would eventually be
bound to pay for the two volumes already publish-
ed and the one now in progress, to let the appro-
priation pass as it stood in the bill, if such had
been the pleasure of the Senate. rIhe work had
been done under a law which is still in existence,
ami u would be m vain for them to say that Con-
gress had no right to pass the law. Mr. B. con-
cluded by saying that be was for paying for what
had been done and getting rid of the contract
Mr. SEVIER would prefer that the resolution
should be amended so as to make it a reso'ution
of the Senate simply; and then there would be a
chance of doing something in the premises; but
even if passed here in its present shape, there
would be but hule probability of its being acted on
by the House.
Mr. HUBBARD said, then the responsibility
would rest with that body, but the joint action of
the two Houses was necessary to do any thing effi-
cient on this subject.
After some further Temarks from Messrs. TAP-
PAN, SEVIER, and PRENTISS,
The resolution was read a third time, and passed.
On motion of Mr. BROWN, the Senate wsnt

compliance with the following resolution, passed
by the Senate on the 24th uld   I
"flíjoieeíi, Tbat the Secretary! of the Treasury
report to the Senate the aggregate amount of all
exptndttrres or payments of erery kind from the
Treasury in each year, from 1824 to 1839 inclu-
sive, in one column, and in another column for
each year the aggregate amount, independent of
the payments on account of the public debt,
whether funded or unfunded, and in a third co-
lumn, the aggregate amount for permanent and
ordinary purposes, excluding payments on ac-
count of objects eithe r extraordinary or temporary;
such as the public debt, trust funds and indemni-
ties, claims of Slates for war debts or 3 per cents
«n lands sold, occasional donations in money to ob-
jects in the District of Columbia or otherwise, sur-
vey of the coast, taking the census, duties refund-
ed, the Exploring expedition, and materials col-
lected for ihe gradual improvement of the navy,
durable public buildmes of all kinds, bridges and
fortification*, all roads, canals, breakwaters, and
improvements in rivers and harbors, arming mili-
tia and forts, all pensions except those to invalids,
and the purchases of title to lands from Indians, the
removal of Indians, and their wars, with such
other payments as may have been made in those
vears for property lost or injuries committed dur-
ing any hostilities."
The resolution was on the same day referred to
the Rezister of the Treasury, with instructions to
prepare a tabular statement, containing the mfor-
rr.auon desired in three separate columns. It is
hereto annexed, marked A.
He was requested, also, to prepare another state-
ment, showing the specific sum which had been
deducted each year on account of each item men-
tioned in the resolution as either extraordinary or
temporary.
Believing that this would be highly useful, as
ishowing the details on which the general results in
the third column of the first statement rest, and as
embracing many statistical facts, possessing in
themselves much interest,I have annexed it, mark-
ed B.
Unless some accidental omission or other error
has occurred, these two statements will present all
the information desired by the resolution.
With high respect,
LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of ihe Treasury.

Vice President of the United Sta'es, and
