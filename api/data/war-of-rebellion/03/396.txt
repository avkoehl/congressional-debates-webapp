the attention of the Government the absolute necessity of sending us fresh troops at once, with ample supplies for them and for those now here. At least 10,000 men should be sent, and that promptly.

You will send the inclosed dispatch* by telegraph to General McClellan and also to the War Department, and forward by mail a copy of this letter. Lose no time in fitting for the field the three-years' volunteers now at the arsenal, and send them here as soon as possible. Call for Colonel McNeil's regiment of Home Guards to garrison the arsenal, and allow him to organize it for the regular three-years' service, if he desires to do so. It is believed that the remaining Home Guards will be sufficient for the city. Should it be necessary, their term of service can be renewed for a short period for the purposes of a city garrison.

The general is not aware whether Colonel Smith's regiment has yet taken the field. If not, he presumes that both his and Colonel Bland's regiments may be sent here without delay. You may doubtless leave the southeast part of the State to General Prentiss. Should Saint Louis be in danger from that direction, troops could be easily called from Illinois and Indiana for its defense. Moreover, a force moving on Saint Louis from the south would be exposed to attack in rear from Cairo. Hence there seems to be little or no danger from that direction. Unless we are speedily re-enforced here we will soon lose all we have gained. Our troops have made long marches, done much effective service, and suffered no small privations. They have received no pay no clothing from the Government, and the small stock furnished by private contribution is now exhausted, so that unless the Government gives us relief speedily our thus far successful campaign will prove a failure.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Acting Adjutant-General.

Major-General FREMONT,

New York:

I am again urgently solicited by adjutant-general in Saint Louis to take command in North Missouri. What shall I do? The forces are gradually closing around Harris. I think a vigorous campaign of a week will settle secession in North Missouri, and leave the troops at your disposal for other service. Please answer to Alton. We need arms much.
