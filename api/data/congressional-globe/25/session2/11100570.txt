Government and Press—Mr. Garland.
all parts of the country, ai eat stake m this questien Out In
dian relations are involved m u Upon its issue depends the
fate of a noble domain, the seat, in no distant time ofpiospenty
and of power It is impoi tant in all pom s of view Tnat wiJe
region, the inte tor piateau ol the continent, with its v, lid moun
tians and its romantic scenes oi chase and war, that ocean of the
prairies, with us peril, its adventure, its haidihood of life so
analogous to the sublimity of spectacle, and the sturmg vicissi
tudesoi the sea itself, tho^e uch valleys of the Oiegon, through
which the same bright banner wmch sparkles on the Atlantic
may carry the stars of our civilization w estward to the Pacific-
all this will be possessed or peopled ere long, either by England
) r by us Which shall it be? Can the sense of our true interest,
can the honor and pride of the nation hesitate? Itisacountiy
ours by right ours by the necessities of geographical position,
ours by every consideiation of national i¡alety, and ours it will
be it tranquil possession, if wetemperatply hut firmly asseitom
rights The world is wide enough for England and for Us We
have much to gain by a cordial intercourse, conducted as be
comes nations of the same bloocl, and the «ame tongue, each at
the head of civilization in its proper hemisphere, much to ha
zard, by either practising oi suffering encroachments on eithei
side Offshoots of that dominant lace, which, starting fiom the
mountains of Caucasus, has proceeded in oppo ite duections
east and west, encircling the globe, if we are to confront each
other on the shores of Asia and of Amenca theie let us meet in
confident good will, imbued with that just consciousness oí each
other'* power and that mutual respect for each othet's lights,
which are the only sure foundation of stable peace
Mr HOWARD (chairman of the Committee on Foieign Af
fairs) asked that the proposed ínstiuctions might be icad, they
were accordingly read, as follow*
"To mqune into the expediency of establishing a post on the
river Columbia for the defence and occupation ol the Territory
oí the United States watered by said river, and also to consul ui
the expediency ol making further provision by law to pievent
the mteimeddling of the officeis or subjects oi foreign Poweis
with the Indians of the United State1-
Mr IIowakd said that he did not n e foi the purpose of
opposing the passage ol the proposed instiurtions, as they only
directed the committee to inquire into the expediency ol adopt
ingthe measme which the gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr
Cusir NGjhad so elaboiately aigucd before the House Indeed,
he was not awaie that any person intended to object to the
adoption of the instructions If the eentieman who pioposed
them had thought proper to have a3cei tamed this point he
might have saved himself much labor and the House much time
by permitting them to pass sub silentio As they weie to go
to a committee of which both the gentleman from Mas achu
setts and himself weie members, and the rest of the committee
had not probably listened to the speech of that gentleman with
the same attention which he [Mr H ] had bes owed upon it, it
might become necessary for that gentleman to letapituli'e
in committee the substance of what he had said in the
House, when the subje< t should be taken up and thus the gen
tleman fiom Massachusetts would have to perform a double
labor It was often necessary for a member of the House, when
sending a subject to tne consideration of a committee, to explain
the views by which he was actuated, if it should so h ippen that
he was nota member of that committee and he sh mid Ihvl
deemed the speech of the gentleman liom Massachusetts m tins
case entirely unnecessary, H it we e not tor one consideiation
suggested by that gentleman, m the coirei tne&s of which he
fMr HI entirely concuired It was, that the debates which
took place in this House were of thcmselve* i mportant, whether
any legislative lesult fallowed oi not This was tiuf be
rond only to what was done w~s wh it was, said m the Hoiis1
"sometimes debates then* pioduced consequences ol 21 eat ma*
nitride They affected b )th the foreign an 1 domes ic piliey of
the («oveirment an 1 it was ilways a matter of ¿teat con&e
quence that the f ublic mind sroukl be fmnishetl with the ma
tenals piopei for the formation (fa couoct judgment upon
every topic of deep interest With the view of stating to the
House some few suggestions which had otcuned to his mind
upon the veiy impoitdiit subject btought befoie the House and
the nation by the gent'emaii fiom Ma^ac'iu^ctts h had
risen to throw thpm out fn consul m ation an 1 he telt t! e
more inclined to do this, beciuse he learcd that, when th< sub
ject came to be calmly weighed, smie difficulties would be
found to exist in the pi o^ecution of the cropped measure to
which the gentleman from Massachusetts hal not adverted m
his speech The coram ttee weie to be instiucted to mqiur1
into the expediency of doing two thing1: cnti ely distinct in then
character, viz of establishing a military post on the Columbia
rivei, and of regulating, by law, th^ cot ínrucial inteuour e
with the Indians beyond the Rocky mountains Hi doubted
whether we were at liberty, under existing treaties with Great
Biitam, to pa^s a law foL the attainment of eithei of these two
objects
The thud at tide of the convention concluded with the Bnfi*h
Goveinmert by Messr Gallatin and Rush, on the 20th O t
1818 was as follow"
"Unagreed that any country that may be claunel by either
party on the Northwest coa^o! \meiica v\e twaidol th" St >
ney Miuntaini shall tozeihei with its harbor  bays, and creel*,

the two high contracting paities may hive to anvpTt of Me
said cou itry, nor shall it be taken to affect the claims ol w y

clause, the obligation oí the convention of 1818 remains, of
course, m full force at this d ij Ol the wisdom or policy of
these two conventions Mi 1Í said he did not mean to speik
He did not understand the gentleman fiom Massachusetts (Mr
Cushing) as calling either m question, and the point was not
before the House The entire country to the west of the Rocky
Mountains was agreed to be left ' fiee and open to the citizens
and subjects of the two poweis " INow, itstemed to him [Mr
II j" that the establishment of a military post there, which
would begainsonedby apaitofthe army of the United States,
and held, necessarily, under the exclusive juiisdiction of oui
Government, would be an infringement oltbeueaty into which
we had entei ed, and the passage of a law to regulate intercourse
with the Indians in that quartei would be still more so, because
the operation ol such a law would not only be an exeicise ol
exclusive jurisdiction, but mu-t spiead ovei a large e\tentof
temtoiy How could it be said that the country was "fiee

hostilities, would be almost preposterous     Tiiat IjjII pfghl to
be passed during litis session, at all-«vents, and he would be
willing to remain here during the whole summer, if it should
be necessary, to pase it No one could view the situation vf
our country, and considpi the piobabte demands which might
be made upon the services oí the army, without perceiving the
pioptieiv of increasing its force It was needless, if not impro
per, now to look at the various subjects to which the attention
of tne aimy might be called The condition of the Indians on
t].e other side 01 the Mississippi was, of itself, a fruitful source
of anxiety, and he felt convinced that, instead of epanng any
poiuon of oursmali but gallant army for the distant duty of the
Columbia river, it was highly expedient to augment it, even for
othei purposes
Mi H said he had risen only foi the puipo*e of bringing
these few points before the notice of the House, and not to dis
cuss any oí them The instructions lookedonfy to an inquiry,
which would be more pioperly made by the committee If,
when the subject should be referred to them, they should deem
it expedient, an opportunity would be afforded both to the gen
tleman from Massacnusetts and himself, as well as to the other
members of the committee, to give it a fuller consideration
After Mr Howard had concluded,
Mr ELMORE, oí South Caiolina, expressing a wish to ex
tendthescope of Mr Cushing s resolution, moved asa eubsti
tute the following
' Resolved, That the Committee on Toretgn Affairs be in
ftructed to inquire into the extent of the country claimed by the
United States west of the Rocky Mountains, on the northwest
coist of the Pacific Ocean, the title under which it is claimed,
md the evidence of the conectne^ of the tale, the extent of sea
coast and the number and de^cupuon of Us harbors, the nature
oí the climate, soil, productions, and trade, and, also, whether it
is expedient to establish a Tcmtonal Government, or one or
more military posts, as possession for the same or any part
thereof and what will be the expense necessary to establish the
sanit, and the annual expenses foi its support, what fortifica,
tions and ships will be required foi said Temtoiy, and what
number of soldiers and sadois will be necessary for its protec
tionrboth in time of peace and in caseofa war with any foreign
power, and tlvt the committee repoit thereon to this House '
Mr CUSHING objected to Mi Elmore's proposition asa
substitute foi his <wn, because it omitted any reference 10 the
Indian relations of the subject, but expressed his willingness to
see u adopted in amendment of, and as an addition to, the ongi
n il instructions and in that form it was adopted by the House
Mi EI MORE then signified his desire to speak on the gene
rtl subject, and, at ins motion, the House adjourned But the
nextdiy he waived his right to the floor, and the resolution of
instruction* as amended was adopted by the House without a
division
