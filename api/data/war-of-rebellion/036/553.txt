COLUMBUS, April 29, 1863.

The enemy in his recent raid came south from the FIFTH District, entering the first at Pontotoc, and that force confronting me has been routed and driven back by my troops.

If your telegrams tome on that subject imply censure, I request a more explicit written statement.

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

Number 23. Report of Colonel John M. Simonton, First Mississippi Infantry. HEADQUARTERS TROOPS, Ponchatoula, MISS., April 30, 1863-10 p. m.

MAJOR: Enemy reported at Summit, on railroad, advancing on Osyka.

I leave this place at 12 o'clock, or about then, for that point, with battery of artillery, 60 cavalry, and 260 infantry. My object is to protect Government property at Osyka, if possible.

All quiet in my front. Our scouts well advanced. I make this move without orders, but could not communicate with you. Hope the move will be approved by the general commanding. I leave most of my cavalry force behind, with orders to dispatch me if any move is attempted by the enemy.

Enemy above reported by Captain [Thomas C.] Rhodes, commanding post at Osyka, to be about 1,500 strong. I will save them if possible.

Don't know what has become of our cavalry above reported gone WEST.

I am, major, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JNO. M. SIMONTON,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major T. F. WILLSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Port Hudson.

Number 24. Report of Brigadier General Lloyd Tilghman, C. S. Army. CANTON, April 24, 1863.

Messenger from Carthage again reports a regiment of cavalry approaching that place.

I have started FIFTY-fourth Alabama and section of artillery, with orders to move rapidly. I have Eighth Kentucky, about 100 strong, and a section.

Might effect something if I had more force.

Please send it if practicable. I need a few cavalry.

LLOYD TILGHMAN,

Brigadier-General.

General PEMBERTON.
