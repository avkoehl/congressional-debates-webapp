Mr K said he had gone into this comparative statement to
show that the Committee on Naval Affairs had not tianseended
the amount which in lormet j ears hod btcn deemed rcasona
ble and proper, although the counti y had hal but half tin num
ber of ships in the sei vice, 01 of guns afloat, which it would
have during the present year
Mr K had heard much about the abu<=e and mi*; implication
of moneys appiopuatedfor the navy, and he believed it all to
be true To illustrate the truth oí the chirge, he would refei
to the table already quoted, showing on one hand the apptopr a
tions made, and on the othei the lesults theiebv obtained In
1800 there had been an appropriations of $2, 04 148, and we
had then 87t> guns afloat, win e m 133G, with an appropriation
or $7011,055 we had but 462 guns aft  at in 1S41 with in ap
propriation of a little over thiee millions, we had 836 guns
afloat, and m 1838, with an appropriation oí over eight mil
lions, we had but554 guna afloat lhese facta wrio suificnnt
toshowhowenoimous must have the abi e3 some where He
trusted that now the time was come, and the men come \\i h it,
in which economy, knowledge, ltitegiiiv, and a d vot^dze il foi
the public service, if they d d not curui' the act al amn jnt ex
pended, would so apply the money as with the same sum to
effect a fai gi eatei extension oí the naval defences of the coun
try than had been witnessed for many years Mr K was no
niggard in regard to the navy He would hive been ■hill-
ing to cive a much laigti sum could it have been
spared, foi he agreed heaiulj *v th the \t;ne,rable gentleman
from Massachusetts {Mi 4damsJ that i ís'ead oí two wii
steameis, it was desirable that we should have twenty The
ocean was teeming with these migi tv engines, lapidly parsing
each other m eveiy direction going wtieiever they listed in dib
regard of Wind and wave-., and which had «vpioprntely been
denominated the 'cavalry oí the ocean, mounted with can
non "
Mr K here went into a coripanson of ¡he population of hi1?
country at avod.feient periods, and at the same time of the
amount of tonnage and the eutis to defend it
In 1800, with a population of 5,305,000 anl an amount oí
669,000 registered tonnage, we had 87b gunsafi mi, in 1841 our
population was 17 ODOjOdl), our tonnage 2,9b0 000 and>etour
guns were but 1,007 This showed how lar our navrtl force 1
was from keeping up with the giowth oi the population and
the commerce of tne counrry Applying the ¡same r it o of de
fence t this day which had existed m 1S00 we should require
two thousand gun^, afljat, and an appropriation of ovei sevt-n
mili Jns
Mr K obseived that although the impoitance of a home
squadron had been very cleaily set firth m the reportofihe
Secretary of the Navy, theie were some o'hei consult rations
wh chcould not but still moie strongly impuss it up m the
mind He here forcibly refer ed it the dev i&tationb of the
enemy's fosee in iheGhe«ap ike and on the exposed coast nf

their dwellings burnt then property stolen and ha 1 t ¡e con

war had cost the country from one hundied dnú fifty to twoh jii
died millions of dollar , an 1 did any gem lemán =¡u¡ pobe th it,
had the United ¡States pos esspd twenty shq s of war well
armed and fully manned, these outlines on o i commeire
would ever have happened which gave the occasion f u so ie
structive a conflict? No man would maintain it I or it must
be remembered that with nations war wa& a question of policy,
however the statesmen coneeined might pietend ittobeaque&
tion of honor Q-ue^tioOb of veracity andqie&tions oí jonor
could easily be negotiated away as ail hisioiy ah mdantly
proved, but when policy inl interest dictated war, the him'er
of the enemy's cannon wa'geneiaily the fust annunciation that
hostilities were commenced and tnen a long ariay o! it-a&ons
wag gotten up as a pretext for the blow
Mr K here referred to and read an extract from the Rich

time ensaged in surveying the channel of the Che--- pealte anil

litatmg the entrance of a British fleet into our harbors He then
paid that the object oí a h>me squadion was to pieventi! ecom
pletion of-urh a puirose He expieos d his great surpribe at
the remarks of some gentlem-ii who seemed to suppose that
the inven ion of laihmdb by facilitating the assemblage of
tioop--, superceded the i tceasity both of for ficau mis and c fa
navy Instead of this, these several modes of defence o i< hr to
go hand in hand and be comb red for the geneial ei I if the
safety of the country
Mr K alluded to the change which bal manifested itself in
the naval policy of Great Butain in íegaid o a «¡uo^titution of

liutnot only wa  steam availed <f for vessels ofwm pro
p?rly so called The Governments of Trance and Englard
were adopting an entirely new policy, by employing armed
steamers lot commercial purposes—thus causing the «agaeiy
and enterprise of the metcan'ile community ios.uppoitthe ex
Ícense of their mval defences—a great and wonderful step in
the preparation f >r maiiume warfare

formidable and sagacious* p >wer had any intention of iromedi
ate war withthiscountiy, it would not at piti&entbuit her po
¿icy, but she was gradually and silently, yet surely alienflg
her whole system She desired above all things to emancipate
hprselfiiom the necessity of deüending on anyofoui r loducts
for carrying on those manufactures which were the great
sources of her wealth Hence while she had emancipated her

Mr K here made some lemaika on British emancipation,
which heconsiiieiedbut asone«tep in thi^giand scheme of the
national policy He adverted to the recent gteat increase of
the slave tiade Two huadrtd thousand weie nowsatd to be
annua ly imported into the West Indies and south America pet

tish manufactures While this was the case how great aiarce
was it for her to offer a guinea a heal foi negtoes captured on
the higa seas' If sht was sincere in her wish .o put an end to
the trade why did she not enter the h tbors, and bieak up the
lactones on shore? But no, she suffered the slaves to be pur
chased \i h British goods, and embarktd on ¡he ocean, and
then of ued to pay her own officers a guinea a head foi catch
