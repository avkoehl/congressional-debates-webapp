THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL" OFFICE,

June 30, 1863.

PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., June 30, 1863-11.10 p. m.

Hon OLIVER P. MORTON,

Governor, Indianapolis, Ind.:

The ruling of the War Department is and has been from the bringing, according to my understanding, that six-months" men should not be exempt from draft, but if drafted should be credited with the time they may have served in the six-months" organizations. To exempt them for six months would practically amount to entire exemption, and thus made six-months" volunteer service in some States equivalent to three-years" service under the draft in others. This would seriously interfere with enforcing the draft, and would be unjust.
