mu , and of seeming í irevei bv sun ible tieaty stipula
ti ins the free and eq ml i ght of nav satina such canal to
nil n ttions, on the pav ment of reasonable tolls
Mi M al«io, from the select committee to
which had been referred the bill to altei the mode
of appointing certain officers of the United States,
and for other purposes, offeied the following res-
olution
Rtsohed, That the President of the United States be re
quested to lay before the House of Representatives asearly
as convenient after the commencement of the next session
of Congress, a list of all the officers of the Government who
derive their appointment from the nomination of the Presi
dent and concurrence of the Senate who have been le
moved from office since the 3d ot March, l~i>9, denoting m

Bpecttve removals, also, alike h t oi the names of those
officers whoie teims of sen ice being limited to foui yeais
were not renominated to the Senate at the expiration of
their comuna ions
Mr HOWARD moved to lay the resolution on
the table
Mi MERCER demanded the yeas and nays
on that motion
Mr  HOWARD called for the special order
Mr MERCER moved to suspend it forthe pur
pose of acting on this lesolution, and asked for
the yeas and nays, which being ordered,
Mr  HOWARD withdrew his motion
The lesolution was then agreed to  and
Mr GRAVES called up the lesolution sub-
mitted by him some time since, to inquire into
he alleged defalcation of Mr C J Ingersoll, late
distiict attoiney in Pennsylvania
Ob]ection was made, and Mr G movedasus-
pension of the mlcs, which was agreed to
Mi   KEIVI said he eai ncstly hoped the resolu
tion would be adopted     The fnends of Mr In-
gersoll, as well as that gentleman himself, were,
and always had been, exceedingly desnous that
afull investigation into all hit, accounts and trans
actions with the Governments>nould begone into
and the more so as this was one of the pioudest
chaiges of his enemies
The lesolution was then agreed to
Mi HOWARD then íenewed the demand for
the special older, which was agreed to
MAINE BOUNDARY QUESTION
The House then, in pursuance of the special
ordei, went into the Committee ot the Whole on
the state of the Union, (Air I ivcoia in the
chair,) and resumed the consideration of the bill
in relation to the difficulties in Mame
Mi CUSHING obta tied the floor, but gave
way to
Mr SALTONSTALL, who made an explana-
tion of his íemarks of last evening
Mr CUSHING then proceeded to discuss the
ments of the question with lefcience to Sir John
Harvey     Mi   C   was convinced that officei had
misconstiued his instructions, a.nd  he adduced
facts which went to show it     As to the bill, he
denied that it was a war mensure, eithei on its
face or in its spirit     What weie the piepaia
tions contemplated by it >   Weie they either ag-
gressive or belligerent?   They weie not, they
were puiely defensive, and in conformity with
the act of 1795     Instead, too, of being an aug
mentation of the Executive power, derived under
that act, it was a diminution, because the law of
5 gave the Piesident general power, whereas
bill íestrictcd it to a'particular exigency—a
itive contingency—on the ausmg of which
le he could act     Having explained and advo-
d the piovisons of the bill, Mr C proceeded
to defend the principles of the bill and the report,
m reply to Mr Biddle As to the present being
an incidental question, it was precisely one of
those which the country could understand
The mam issue, the question of boundary, was
involved in a tedious controversy, running through
a long series of ponderous documents     Not so
with this     It was a question of fact, plam and
intelligible to every man     The State of Maine
had been invaded, and that all could understand
Bring it home to the ordinary occurrences of life
A question of title to an estate might be so involved
in intricacy, that no common man could unravel
it, butif a trespasser fenced mhalf his neighbor's
farm, it was plainlyundeistood     Moreover, the
! case of the Aioostook was stronger than that of
Madawaska    In legard to the lattei,Great Butain
had set up a claim of jurisdiction on the giound
| of uti possidetis     But they had never before set
i up to exercise practical jurisdiction in the Aroos
took, for there the uti possidetis gave it clearly to
' the United States, and we had always held over
I it full sovereignty    Mr C produced a map, pub
lished by the House of Commons of England,
and also cited the commission of the Earl of Dur
| ham asGovernoi General of all the British North
' American provinces, and which  demonstrated
that she herself then i egai ded the sovereignty over
this territory as not belonging to her     Aftei
dwelling on the mam points very briefly, Mi  C
concluded
Mr CRARY, after a brief review of the ques-
tion, made an earnest defense of the bill, which
he legaided as a peace or a war measuie, just as
it might be taken by Great Britain As foi the
State of Maine, he knew the chaiacter of the
people of this countiy too well to think, for a
moment, that she would recede a single step and
rather than vote to coeice hei to do so, he would
abandon his seat and go home He hoped the
Btitibh Government wou'd at once disavow the
unlawful acts of hei Provincial Governor, but if
she did not, he was prepared foi the woist con
sequences Nor had he any of those teirors of
her rnighty povv er which some gentlemen seemed
to enteitam Her relations with Russia, with
Peisia, with the Burmese Empire, and the Tast
generally, were of the most critical chaiactei
The blood she had so cruelly shed in Canada,
had weaned the heart of that Province from her,
and her domestic relations were at this moment
being shaken to their center He did not desire
war, but he would yield nothing to pieserve a
dishonoiable peace Aftei some furl! erremaiks,
Mr   C   concluded, and
Mi   ADAMS followed at length in support of
the bill, and on the question generally     He said
he should not he sutpiis d that, if the Congiess
failed to do an> thing at the piesentcrisis.it mieht
be taken as an aigument by Gieat Britain that
I this Government had left Maine to its fate    She
I would answei " no" to all the claims of thatState
to hive hei lights of jurisdiction respected   What
evei might be tne action ot the House at the pies
1 ent time, he believed ti e question would evtntu-
ally have to be settled by force of aims   and, for
, one, he was not disposed to have much furthei
I negotiation     It was fot this icason that he was
disposed to vote foi this bill, as a furthei notifica
tion to the British Government—one which she
could not mi&understatid—as to what weie our
i deteimmations     He was m fi.voi of the bill, not
I meiely because this contingency presented itself,
| but to put us in a state of defense for any contin
gency that might occur     He understood it a  a
I bill to aim merely for the defense of our soil, and
I not as an indication that we were determined oi
i expected to have war     England cannot undei
! stand it thus, theie is nothing offensive in it at
I all     Every independent nation, whether weak or
I s long, has the right to arm herself up to the ears
I The light to arm in self defense is a right of peace
Indeed, he was lather disposed to take a suffer
course than the bill proposes, foi he did not alto
gether appi ove the section which proposes to send
1 a special Minister to England, he thought she
I had assumed a wrong position, and should rather
1 send us a special Minister to explain what, m-
' deed, were her intentions
j     The Piesident and Secretary of State seemed to
' regret the course Maine has taken, but, so far as
he was concerned, he respected and revered her for
it, it was one sanctioned by the unanimous voice
of her Legislature    The act of thatState was de-
liberate, one of the qualities which belonged to
firm and consistent action The act was not rash
and indiscreet, as denounced by some, but it was
the exeicise of hevunquestionable right to defend
herteintory, and so far fiom disapproving, he
would esteem her course, during the shoit rem-
nant of his life, as honorable
We had been so quiescent that the usurpations
of England had now commenced to assume the
form of rights He wished to stop them where
they are—send them back That theie should be
no further mistake no futher delusion on the part
of England as to what our rights are in this mat-
ter, he thought this bill should be passed If,
however, gentlemen would offer a substitute
equally film, equally argumentative, he would be
willing to take it, not without
i Mi LEGARE made a few lemarksm reply to
Mr Adams, and was understood to intimate his
! approval of the resolutions which passed the Sen-
ate, and that he would not, on any account, vote
this tremendous power, given in the bill, to the
Piesident, weie he not of the opinion that he
j would us(  it with great prudence
Mi BELL íegarded the formet pioceedmgs of
Massachusetts or Mame, oi of this Government,
as of veiy little consequence to the present ques-
tion, because, if Gieat Butain intended to assert
her claim by arms, she would give us an mtima-
I tion of that fact, or otheiwise postpone it, and
therefore we need not apprehend any violent col-
lision till we have leceived information from that
j Government Mr 13 did not think the bill mits
present shape could pass the House, and some
compiomise must be come to He could not
bring himself to believe that anything like war
would ensue    He hadneverquestioned our right
' to the boundary chimed by us, and though he
had anticipated difficulties, yet theie was no issue
of national honoi now involved    All he thought
i the House ought now to do, was to express its
! concunence in the views of the Piesident, not by
I the passage of this bill, oi the fust section of it,
but to giant him a sufficient supply of money to
execute the powers a! ready \ested m him, in case
the contingency provided for under the existing
law of 1795 should ause He had no objection
to vote a contingent appropriation of $5 000,000,
ormoie,and he had no gieat objection to the
pioposition to send a sneci il messenger to Eng-
land, if the Executive desned it
l Mt HO WARD explained that the latter prop-
osition was one em mating entnely from the
Committee   on Poieign Affaiis,  no membei  of
, which, he   believed, knew whether it met the
' views of the Executive or not
Mr BELL was glad it came from the source
it did He then went on furthei to sustain his
views of the non expediency of action at pres-
ent They ought to do no moie than declare
their ov^n opinion, or concurrence in the views
of the Executive, and giant him sufficient sup-
plies for any exigency tint might arise, till dis-
patches wen received from England and the new
Congiess could be called together There was
no necessity to go beyond this point
Mr EVLRETT remarked that the only point
of contioversy was this that the Butish threat-
ened to take foicible and exclusive possession of
i the debatable terutory, and this is what it is in-
tended by this bill to prevent But an agieement
had been enured into that all fuithei proceedings
on both sides should be estopped, and aftei com-
I mumcating thtt fact, by the President, there we
should have stopped, for no furthei measures
were requued Pliey should not have peimitted
any seuous difficulty to have gnwn out of an
I incidental question     Theie was no necessity foi
i this bill, foi   in any contingency, Maine would
not be left defenseless, as the law of 1795 was in
force, and authonzetl as much as the Executive
could possibly do in sixty days
At this stage, it being thiee o'clock, the House
I took its daily recess
I                            1\I \1M5 SEXTON
Mr EV\NS addiessed the House for a short
time in explanation of some portion of his íe-
marks made on Fuday evening, which he ad-
mitted to have been too seveie on an honorable
gentleman [Mr Saltón stall] for whom he crier 
ished the highest possible personal íespeet He
then proceeded to express his entire conviction
i of the rectitude of that gentleman's motives, and
