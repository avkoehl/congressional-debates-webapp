GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA, No. 34. Camp near New Market, Va., June 1, 1864.

I. Major General Julius Stahel is charged with the important duties of picketing the camps of the army now in the Valley of the Shenandoah, and of throwing out small flanking parties while on the march, so as to give timely information of the approach of the enemy. Brigadier General J. C. Sullivan will promptly furnish, on the requisition of Major-General Stahel, such infantry force as may be needed for the picketing and flanking parties.

II. Brigadier General J. C. Sullivan is charged with the foraging of the army, and will take such energetic measures as to insure a full supply and prompt and just distribution to all portions of the command. All empty wagons will be placed at Brigadier-General Sullivan's disposal, and Major-General Stahel will furnish such small cavalry escorts as he may think necessary, but as a general rule foraging trains will mostly be guarded and escorted by infantry.

III. No receipts will be given or payments made for property taken, except to well-known and openly avowed loyal men, and then only on the express approval of the general commanding, under his own signature.

By command of Major-General Hunter:

CHAS. G. HALPINE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
