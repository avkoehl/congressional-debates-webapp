down the border until we get into communication. The enemy yesterday were concentrating at Rose Hill, intending, I think, to prevent a junction of Peabody's command and mine and as a flank movement upon Kansas City, and should be met by a counter-movement, as I have suggested.

I started a dispatch to Captain Prince last night, which he will get to-day, communicating the same information and making the same suggestion. I have a force actually engaged at Forts Scott and Lincoln and Barnesville, and are now starting a small force at the Trading Post, and occupying this place with 700 cavalry, 700 infantry, and two pieces of artillery. Yesterday I cleared out Butler and Parkville with my cavalry about 20 miles.

You are now posted as to my command and of my movements; reciprocate by letting me hear from your column and Colonel Peabody's at the earliest possible moment.

HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Saint Louis, September 15, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Asst. Adjt. General Hdqrs. of the Army, Washington, D. C.:

Reliable information from the vicinity of Price's column shows his present force to be 11,000 at Warrensburg and 4,000 at Georgetown, with pickets extending towards Syracuse. Green is making for Booneville with probable force of 3,000. Withdrawal of force from this part of Missouri risks the State; from Paducah, loses Western Kentucky. At the best, I have ordered two regiments from this city, two from Kentucky, and will make up the remainder from the new force being raised by the governor of Illinois.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.
