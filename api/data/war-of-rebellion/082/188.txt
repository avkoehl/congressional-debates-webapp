HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, July 12, 1864.

(Received 11.45 p.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The order for the withdrawal of the corps appears to direct General Gregg to take up Colonel Bryan's picket-line, though they are ordered to report to General Warren. Is it intended to withdraw Colonel Bryan's and put General Gregg's command on the same line? Colonel Bryan's command is tolerably familiar with the country now.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 12, 1864-12 midnight.

Major-General HANCOCK:

It is not intended to withdraw Colonel Bryan (or relieve him), but to place him under the command of General Gregg, so that there shall be but one head of cavalry, and as General Warren commands the left flank, it is designed [that] General Gregg should communicate with and report to him what occurs instead of [to] yourself, as he has been doing to-day. He is also instructed to report to these headquarters.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: Two prisoners of Sixth Virginia Cavalry, captured to-night, report Fitz. Lee's division and Rosser's brigade in my front, and as having engaged me to-day. They say they know nothing of any infantry on the plank road or at Reams'. They know nothing of a movement of Hill's corps.

Yours, respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.

(Copy sent General Meade 2.40 a.m. 13th.)

Very respectfully,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
