by Colonel Harrington from Lieutenant- Colonel Bradley, commanding at Decatur, says that a large force is still being reported at Moulton. Lieutenant-Clolnel Northrop, commandng at Courtland, writes to Colonel Harrington that the cavalry reports a force seven miles in front of that point. The Forty- second are well internched. This is being done oat other points along the line. Every means have been employed to gain information as to the number of the enemy at Moulton; as yet, with very little satisfactory results. The country is full of guerrilla parties. Our line is too much extended, and weak in consequence. Another division could be used to advantage. I have not withdrawn the detachments of my command east of this place, being governed by the opinioon espressed by General Buell and yourself as to the destination of the force in our front and the anxiety of General Buell to hold the line and keep open the communication.

Chief of Staff, Army of the Mississippi:

Artillery and ifantry have both been reported at Moulton, but I almost begin to doubt it. Railroad open to near Courtland, or was yesterday evening. Have no information about the Nashville and Decatur Railroad. I understand there is a ferry in the rear of Courtland. There is a good road on the other side of the Tennessee River running up the valley; a first- rate road up the valley on this side. Informaiton received from a man who was in Tupelo Sunday, monday, and Tuesday is that all of the troops but General Price's command have lef; infantry and artillery by the Mobile raod. Cavalry, said to be 8,000, but I doubt the nubmer, east through Marion and Franklin Counties. Their cavalry force is no doubt those now in our front. Yesterday we had possession of the whole road, but last night the infantry and cavalry stationed at Town Creek bridge stampeded and left, arriving in town this forenoon, I think without cause. Two companies of cavalry have been ordered to proceed immediately to that staion, and the infantry will go by railroad with orders to remain there and proceed at once to repair damage if any has been done. The watertank at Leighton last evening was burned.

Ground at Tuscumbia not favorable for fortifying. A point for that purpose might be selected northeast of town. A good engineer would be required. I have none in this division. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles is in command at Iuka; he is a good office. All quiet along the lines to- day. From the front reports have been received from Tupelo to
