HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 25, 1863-11 a. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD, Baltimore:

The small body of troops you speak of will be of more bother than use, in my opinion. You had better abandon all hope of getting assistance from that quarter. There are good reasons why you should return to-night.

Major-General.

The information furnished you in regard to Young's Island Ford is erroneous. There are 4 feet of water on that ford.
