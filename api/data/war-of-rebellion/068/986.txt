General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

This city is in hot danger. It should be defended with all our resources to the sacrifice of minor considerations. You are relied on to use every effort to unite all your forces at the earlies practicable time with the troops in our defenses, and then together either fight the enemy in the field or defend the entrenchments. Our lines are a little in front of Drewry's Bluff, crossing the railroad and turnpike.
