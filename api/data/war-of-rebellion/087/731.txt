on the right of the Second Brigade, with my right well refused, to meet an attempt of the enemy to turn our right flank. The brigade was on the left of the division behind the breast-works, its right resting on the New Market road. The regiments were moved and posted as directed and in the following order from left to right: Eleventh Maine, Captain Merrill; Twenty-fourth Massachusetts, Colonel Osborn; Tenth Connecticut, Colonel Otis, and One hundredth New York Volunteers Captain Brunck, covered by a strong line of skirmishers. The right of the Twenty-fourth was well refused. The Tenth Connecticut and One hundredth New York were retired in echelon some seventy-five yards, occupying a commanding ridge of ground, with open pine wood in front for about 100 yards. In front of the Eleventh it was open pines, but a thicket of little pines in front of Twenty-fourth Massachusetts. While these dispositions were being made, the Second Brigade on my immediate left was hotly engaged, as was also the skirmish line in front of the Eleventh Maine and Twenty-fourth Massachusetts. The rebel line advanced to the attack of my left without skirmishers, and was allowed to come within close range. It did not long stand the fire of the Eleventh and Twenty-fourth; the repulse was complete and severe. The second line maintained its position and fire for some time, but the attack on my left was over. My scouts soon after reported to me that the enemy was forming in the field (Cox's plantation), 500 yards in front, in two lines of battle, opposite my extreme right. To prevent being outflanked I placed forty men of the Eleventh Maine, Lieutenant Small, on the right of the One hundredth New York, across the road leading from the church on the New Market road into the field where the enemy was forming. It was thick wood here and the men were extended in one rank.

The enemy was not long in making his appearance. As before, his line advanced without skirmishers, and with evident determination. Emerging into the more open pines, the rebels received the close fire of the Tenth Connecticut and One hundredth New York, but pressing down the road and opening a smart fire, the One hundredth New York gave way. I was almost immediately rallied and brought back to their colors. Adjutant Peck, of this regiment, was mortally wounded while gallantly endeavoring to rally the men. He fell, standing by his colors when they were almost deserted.* The regiment, after resuming its place, behaved well; helped to repulse the enemy. The Tenth stood like a wall of granite. The enemy was handsomely repulsed, leaving his dead within a few yards of my line. My skirmish line was immediately advanced, but met a stiff line of the enemy at a short distance. Fearing a renewal of the attack on my right, I asked the general for a regiment. He sent me two (the One hundred and twelfth and One hundred and forty-second New York), which were disposed in echelon to protect the right flank; but the enemy made no further demonstration against our lines. About 2 p. m. the brigade was formed in two lines for an attack, but when the advance took place the enemy was found retiring rapidly from the field beyond the wood. About 20 prisoners were captured.

The rebel dead were found scattered along the whole front of the brigade. Two rebel captains (one, Captain John D. Adrian, commanding a regiment, Forty-fourth Alabama) were killed on my front.

The list of casualties occurring in the brigade has been already forwarded, amounting to 5 killed and 35 wounded; light, indeed, compared with the loss which must have been inflicted on the enemy.
