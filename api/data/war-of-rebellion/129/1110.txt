RICHMOND, VA., February 21, 1865.

Hon. JOHN FORSYTH,

Mobile, Ala.:

MY DEAR SIR: You will readily understand why during the session of Congress my private correspondence should be in arrears. I have now, though it may seem late, to thank you for your letter of 31st of December. The article inclosed from the Register and Advertiser is a substantial expression of my own views on the subject of employing for the defense of our country all able-bodied men we have, without distinction of color. It is now becoming daily more evident to all reflecting persons that we are reduced to choosing whether the negroes shall fight for or against us, and that all arguments as to the positive advantages or disadvantages of employing them are beside the question, which is simply one of relative advantage between having their fighting element in our ranks or in those of our enemy.

On the other topic suggested by you, making use of this subject as an aid for negotiations, you will appreciate the obligation of reticence imposed on me in these matters, and I can only say that I perceive no discordance in the views you express from what wise policy would dictate. So far, therefore, from obstructing any effort that the Government may be, or may have been, making in the hope of securing our independence, the influence of your journal in the line which you propose to take would be a valuable assistance.

With many thanks for your offer for cordial support in my labors for the success of our common country, I am,

Very truly and respectfully, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., February 21, 1865.

His Excellency JOHN MILTON,

Governor of the State of Florida, Tallahassee, Fla.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor bearing date December 9, 1864, inclosing to me "Joint resolutions of confidence and thanks to President Jefferson Davis. " For this marked manifestation of unabated confidence on the part of the Legislature of Florida I feel deeply sensible. It is truly gratifying in these times of peril and great public excitement for the Executive to be sustained by such evidences of continued approval. For myself please receive assurances of my high regard and a just appreciation of your valuable services, and believe me,

Truly, your friend and fellow-citizen,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
