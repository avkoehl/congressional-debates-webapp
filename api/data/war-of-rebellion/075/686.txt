Brigadier-General MACKALL:

GENERAL: Before I could deliver General Johnston's message General Cleburne had moved one of his brigades (Granbury's) to the top of the mountain (Dug Gap) upon the representation of Colonel Williamson, who reported that the enemy were forming line in his front and showing considerable force. General Cleburne is up at the gap in person and I have not yet seen him. The remainder of the division (Lowrey and Polk) are camped some 300 yards to the right of the Sugar Valley road, going from Dalton, and the headquarters of the division are at some building near by. In case you should wish to send any orders during the night I have instructed the bearer of this to remain at your quarters to conduct your courier.

Very respectfully,
