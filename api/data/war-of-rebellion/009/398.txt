eral Dix has not troops enough now to co-operate with me against Weldon.

BURNSIDE.

FORT MONROE, June 9, 1862-8.05 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

In accordance with your dispatch, requesting me to communicate with General Dix, I thought it best to see him in person. Left my department at 5 p. m. yesterday and came through canal. Shall leave in two hours unless I get other orders from you. I meet General Dix in a few minutes and will telegraph result of conference. In the mean time will be glad to hear from you, and will give any information you may desire.

All quiet in my department. We had a small fight at Washington on Friday last, in which we were victorious.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Fort Monroe:

The President is now with me in the Department. We have nothing to communicate, but leave it to you and General Dix to make such military arrangements as you may deem expedient. We would be glad to be informed of the result of your conference. I wish also to know whether there is anything you desire that can be furnished by this Department. Have the cars and locomotives reached you? I would like to know confidentially from you by letter of Governor Stanley's operations and your opinion of them and what the facts really are.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

FORT MONROE, June 9, 1862-1 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Your telegram received. I have already telegraphed in reference to the co-operation of General Dix and myself. I also referred to Governor Stanley's policy. It is evidently misunderstood by the Northern people. Mr. Colyer has misrepresented the mater, if newspapers are correct. Governor Stanley is as sound on the Union question as you or I. In answer to a dispatch from me to General McClellan, stating that I was here, he says: "Can you not come up to see me in a special boat? Shall I go?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I think it would be desirable for you to see and confer with General McClellan, and you have the permission of the Department to do so if your own command does not require your presence. You will advise me before leaving Fort Monroe for New Berne, if convenient to do so.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
