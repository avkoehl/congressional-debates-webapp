THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C. RIVES, WASHINGTON,- D. C.
Thirty-Fifth Congress, 2d Session.
' WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1859.
New Series....No. 70.
know very well, and the experience of every gen-
tleman will bear me out in the declaration, that
no single article of supply furnished to the Gov-
ernment, under the contract-system, comes fairly
up to the standard; and it never has been other-
wise, from the foundation of the Government to
this hour. Take, for instance, candles, soap, or
any other article you choose, and you will find a
deterioration from the samples in every article
that is supplied. No supervision, no inspection,
lio means of investigation, will ever prevent it; be-
cause the quality of the article cannot be a^fcer-
tained until it is distributed all over the globe in the
ships of war, or wherever else it is required to be
used. Then itis discovered that the candles run
away, and that the soap will not effect the pur-
poses for which itis designed, in salt water, and
all that sort of thing, [laughter,] even although
the contractors have given adequate security that
the candles will not run, and that the soap will
be equal to the purposes for which it is required.
[R.enewed laughter.]
fiTow, 1 desire that the people who use these
candles and this soap shall be protected. I desire
that that sort of light and that sort of soap shall
be given to them that shall come up to the stand-
ard of the pioposals invited. I have referred to
these two articles because every gentleman uses
candles and every gentleman uses soap, [Cries of
" Oh no !" and laughter;] and when he sees can-
dles that will run, and soap that will not wash,
lie will recollect that the contract system is a fail-
ure, and will come here and vote intelligently, as
a gentleman ought to do who has a seat here, and
break up the contract system altogether.
Now, Mr. Chairman, this is the sort of econ-
omy that I would practice in the expenditure of
this Government. I would have the supplies for
the Government bought in open market.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. It is evident that
we cannot finish this bill to-day, and I therefore
move that the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Hopkins reported that
the Cornmitttee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had had the Union generally under con-
sideration, and particularly the bill of the House
(No. 872) making appropriations for the service
of the Post Office Department during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1860, and had come to no
resolution thereon.
EVENING SESSION.
Mr. ABBOTT. I move the adoption of the
following resolution:
Resolved. That tlie lesoUition of the House, authorizing
evening sessions, be so extended as to allow a &ea&ioii this
evening.
Mr. McGlUEEN. I object; and now move
that the House adjourn.
The question was taken; and the House re-
fused to adjourn; there being, on a divisionâ€”

Mr. ABBOTT. I move a suspension of the
rules for the purpose 1 have indicated.
The question was taken; and tlie rules were

Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I ask the
unanimous consent of the House to discharge the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
from the further consideration of Senate bill No.
341. It is for the protection of the piers and
light-house at Chicago. I have a letter from the
engineer in charge, in which he says that, unless
this appropriation is made, the piers will go to
decay and the light-house topple over.
Objection was made.
Mr. WASHBU RNE, of Illinois. I move a sus-
pension of the rules.
Mr. ABBOTT. I ask the gentleman to with-

it for that purpose alone.

now adjourn.

tion to the resolution which I submitted yester-
i day, which was then objected to, and, of course,
had to lie over under the rule, i rise now, not
so much with a view of pressing the considera-
