FIRST BRIGADE, FRANKLIN'S DIVISION,

Centerville, March 10, 1862-1.30 p. m.

Captain PURDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: As I informed you yesterday, I was led to drive back the enemy's pickets, from information that seemed somewhat reliable. At night I occupied Burke's Station carefully and Fairfax Station, and the intermediate line, as well as Sangster's Station, with regiments or strong detachments. This morning I occupied at 12.30 p. m. Centerville with a detachment of the First Infantry, the regiment following, entering Centerville by the old Braddock road. The last detachment of the enemy left late last night, blowing up the bridges on Cub and Bull Runs. I have also this day occupied Sangster's Station with the Third New Jersey Volunteers, pushing heavy detachments to the front. I was without orders, but necessarily found myself occupying the country in advance of all the columns, as a necessary precaution for my own flanks, even securing Burke's Station and all that railroad most perfectly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. KEARNY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I have to state that at Fairfax Court-House, as at Centerville, the columns found my troops previously in occupation.

KEARNY.
