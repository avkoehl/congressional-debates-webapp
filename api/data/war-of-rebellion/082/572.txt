HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, July 28, 1864. (Received 10 a.m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

The picket officer on the left of our line nearest the railroad reports that nine trains of cars moved from Petersburg to Richmond from dark last night until 2 a.m. this morning. The rebels cheered as the trains passed. I consider this more reliable than the previous report of the signal officer.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

The signal officer on being called to account for not reporting as many trains as the officers of the picket, says that the only trains that passed the Junction were the two he reported; that trains were moving all night from Petersburg to near the Junction and then back, as if they were shifting the position of their troops.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major LUDLOW,

General Butler's Staff, Deep Bottom:

General Butler wants you to return at once to Kautz's camp and see if it is true that his dismounted men have no arms, and if it is true see that they get them and ammunition as quickly as possible. They are relied on at present as an important part of the force to defend this line and must have arms to be of any use.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

Will the operator send this dispatch by orderly. Major Ludlow is probably at Hancock's or Foster's headquarters.
