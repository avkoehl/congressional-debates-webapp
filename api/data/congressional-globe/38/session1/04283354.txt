Mr. SMITHERS. Before the question is put
to the House, I desire to make a slight modifica-
tion of the fust section of my substitute. I move
to insert after the word " service," ill the last line, J act shall bc'con^tiued to alter or in any way affect the law
the words "in the line of his duty." The effect "    
of that modification will be to require that the

j! So the House refused to order the main ques-
tion, and the bill and amendments wei.e therefore
party shall huvu been wounded or that his dis-
ease shall have been incurred in the line of his
duty.
Now, sir, I have no desire to discuss this ques-
tion. i suppose the proposition is well under-
stood by every gentleman upon this floor. The
alteration I have made in my substitute is a plain
and simple one, and in order that the question
may be at once taken upon the substitute I de-
mand the previous question,
Mr. MALLORY. Will the gentleman from
Delaware allow me to make a suggestion to him
before he demands the pievious question?
Mr. SMITHERS. Gentlemen around me gen-
erally desire that thu question shall be taken at
once. 1 must, therefore, decline to yield.
Mr. STEVENS. I should like to have an op--*'
portunity to offer a small amendment,
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. Will the gen-
tleman from Delaware allow me to ask him a
single question about his tmbstitute?
Mr. SMITHERS. I cannot do it.
Mr. THAYER. I would inquire whether, if
the previous question is sustained, it will be com-
petent to move to add a section to the bill as
amended ?
The SPEAK12U. It will be in order if the
1 flout'e should adopt the substitute. It will not be
I in order to strike out any partof if, but it will be
' in oider fo mid additional sections.
