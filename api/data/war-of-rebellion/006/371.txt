understood at the North that two persons, prompted by heavy bribes, had left there to burn the principal bridges on the Wilmington and Charleston Railroad; that the Burnside expedition is to take that road, and that the other fleet, acting in concert, will take the road from Charleston to Savannah, thus isolating Charleston.

The general is of opinion that this may be reliable, and desire that you take such precautionary measures as may be in your power to insure the safety of the railroad from any incendiary attempts within the limits of your district.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

T. A. WASHINGTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
