I re-enforcement his command, believing it necessary, by Captain Gillham's company, of the Sixth Minnesota. As General G. H. Gordon has placed a part of his force at the mouth of White River, I have this day sent another copy (inclosed) to Captain Hunter to embark with all my troops to this post. This is necessary, as my force is too much reduced for the duties required of me. To-day Dobbin with a part of Shelby's command made a raid on the plantations with a mounted force four times as large as my whole cavalry, and I have reason to think these reserves, nearly all mounted, are more than 1,000 men. Please to give Captain Hunter aid in getting off as early as practicable. The number of sick in my command has greatly reduced my effective force. I have applied for cavalry and artillery, and have been furnished with 100-days' men, with whom I am [sic] of marching out of my lines.

Your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., August 1, 1864.

Captain J. R. C. HUNTER,

Commanding Detachment, Mouth of White River:

SIR: Inclosed I send you an order to come to this post. The Sixth Minnesota came here 850 strong, and the effects of change of climate have rendered them so they can turn out only 250 fit to march to-day. Colonel Dobbin made a raid on the leased plantations, which extended twenty miles south of this place, with 400 mounted men, with Shelby's reserve of more than 1,000, to run off the stolen property. I have less than 300 cavalry, and 147 of them go out of service on the 7th and 14th instant. You will see the necessity of your coming up quickly. I have written to General Gordon inclosing him a copy of your order and requesting him to aid you in getting off immediately.

Your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain J. R. C. HUNTER,

Commanding Detachment, Mouth of White River:

SIR: You will embark your own detachment and Captain Gillham's company, of the Sixth Minnesota Infantry, and with all your baggage and camp and garrison equipage, rations, &amp;c., for Helena, Ark., as early as practicable. You will communicate the order to Brigadier General George H. Gordon or the senior officer of your district in order that he may occupy the position which you vacate. By General Canby's order I was to leave a force of fifty men at your post, which the presence of the enemy induced me to re-enforce by adding Captain gillham's company to your command. your presence is needed here as early as practicable.

Your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
