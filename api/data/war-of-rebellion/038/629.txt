JACKSON, February 17, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Send the 32-pounder rifle and 30-pounder Parrott gun intended for General Taylor to Yazoo City immediately. Make all possible dispatch. All their ammunition will go with them. I prefer that these guns go in advance of the field battery, or even of a portion of the Texas regiment.

Major-General LORING, Yazoo City:

If you find it impracticable to establish the batteries at the mouth of Yalabusha, you are authorized to stop [T. N.] Waul at Yazoo City.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON:

By dispatch from Lieutenant [F. E.] Shepperd, C. S. Navy, of the 14th, from Tallahatchee, the enemy had driven off our parties from the Pass, and were coming through. I am trying to get boats ready to meet them. We shall need another regiment and a battery here, besides men to man these boats. Colonel Waul and command go on up to-day. A courier goes through with letters to Vicksburg.

ISAAC N. BROWN,

Commander.

YAZOO CITY, February 17, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON, Vicksburg:

GENERAL: I have to day received from Lieutenant Shepperd, C. S. Navy, who has been for some time engaged in obstructing the Yazoo Pass, a dispatch, dated Tallahatchee River, February 14, via Grenada, February 16, of which the following is a copy:

The enemy have driven us off from the works on the Pass, and are coming through. Hasty obstructions with fortifications may save Yazoo City. I have done my best; worked under their noses, till their pickets came in 100 yards of me.

I am fitting out the Mary Keene and Star of the West, and shall need men to man them; unfortunately, I have no boat just now to send
