Major General S. JONES:

I shall get more war troops than are called for. War troops are unarmend to defend Mobile. I want troops armed and which cannot be taken from that point under any contingency. If it can be certain that any ninety-day company going in for the war could be kept at Mobile with their arms until armed by the Confederacy, I have no objection.

Governor.
