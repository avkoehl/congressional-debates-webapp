Hanover Junction. Should Breckinridge move on this point he would probably arrive here about 7 p. m. His force is estimated at about 10,000 men. Any other portion of the corps which is intended to be sent here I think should be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. Our cavalry are well to the front, and report one brigade of the enemy's cavalry (Rosser's) about 5 miles distant.

D. A. RUSSELL,

Brigadier-General.

The commissary was able to issue but one day's rations yesterday. He has been instructed to forward the balance ordered without delay.
