Captain W. H. Greenwood, corps inspector; Captain J. W. Steele, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant L. L. Taylor, aide-de-camp; Captain Pearson, commissary of musters, acting aide-de-camp; Captain Foraker, Lieutenants Berry and Burton, signal officers, rendered good service as volunteer aides.

Lieutenant-Colonel Remick, chief commissary,and Captain Schoeninger, chief quartermaster, deserve great credit for the efficiency with which their departments were managed. Captain Kaldenbaugh, provost-marshal, always had his department in the best of order.

The Artillery Brigade was under the command of Captain Lyman Bridges, Illinois Light Artillery. His report and that of battery commanders have been forwarded to the chief of artillery, Department of the Cumberland. The artillery was well managed in action and the horses well cared for on the march and in camp. Captain Bridges deserves credit for the efficiency of the artillery arm.

Appended will be found a tabular statement of the casualties of the corps from the 3rd day of May, the commencement of the campaign, to the 8th day of September, the date of the return to Atlanta.

Respectfully submitted.

D. S. STANTLEY,

Major-General, Commanding Fourth Army Corps.
