were without ammunition and could not have advanced toward Dabney's Mill. Again, the newness of the troops under General Sickel rendered it impossible to move them through the woods, and, besides, it would have left our communication by the Vaughan road exposed. Had the brigades been ordered to move to Dabney's Mill the most expeditious route would have been to return to the road taken by the other troops of the corps. General Winthrop's brigade did not change its position until after dark.

Picket-firing in vicinity of Fort Sedgwick was much heavier than usual about daylight this a.m. The enemy threw a few shells, and seemed very vigilant along that part of our line. Three deserters from Wallace's brigade confirm report about Early. They also give a report that Raleigh has been captured.
