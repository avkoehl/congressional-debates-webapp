APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July, 1841.
27th 0«ng-"'1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
pressly declare that General Harrison was opposed
to a National Bank, that he was against it on con
stitutional ground0- and unless I am greatly mis
informed, a distinguished gentleman of North
Carolina, (Mr Badger,) now a member of the
Cabinet, in an audress before the Whig convention
of that State, i idignantly pronounced ihe assertion
that General Harrison was in favor of such a Bank,
to be a falsehood. This speech was, I understand,
pnnted and circulated all over North Carolina I
have not seen it myself, but have received my in-
formation from an undoubted source
Mr. Graham said the speech was not made be-
fore the Whig convention, but at a public meeting
m that State
Mr. Buchanan Then the gentleman admits
that the speech was made Where it w as made
is of little consequence.
Mr Calhoun I have the "speech of Mr Badger
in my hand, and shall read the following extract
from it:
"Next it is said that General Hamsoa favors a
Bank of the United Slates. The charge is false
His opinions, on the contrary, are against a Bank "
Mr Graham The spesch was not made be
fore the Whig State Convention on the 5th oí Octo-
ber, 1840.
Mr. Calhoun.   It will «-how tor i self.   It ap
psars to have leen made oa the 2' e i March, 1840
Mr Graham,   át a meeting c  the citizen  at
Granville
Mr Calhoun assented to this, and aid that a
hundred thousand copies of toe speech had been
printed and circulated.
Mr Buchanan continued     The misunderstand-
ing relates not to what Mr. Badger 'aid, but meit
ly as to when and where he said it   The important
fact is established beyond all doubt, that this (lis
tingmshed gentleman, who wassekcted by the late
President as «member of the Cabinet, on account
of  his eminent talents and his avowed political
principles, did ci me out   at a great convention in
March last, arid, in th  strongest terms, d d pro
nouiice the (huge  to be fal e tint H rns >n  fa
vond a Bank of ihe United Stales    Tais i  ,111
dcMie to know, and whe her one hundn d thousand
or one thousand copies ot this ad ire«s were uieu
lated, is a matter of small importance    We   I en
have the solem i declaration ot a man of high rna-
racter, at the head ot the Whig pirty in North Ci-
rohna, brard ng as a falsehood the charge thu the
late President even favored a National Bank   Ai d
yet it it gravely asse ted that the peopl- ,\t the late
election ha\e determined in favor oUmlu Bmk1

was carefully concealed from the people
The late Legislature of Pennsylvania was Whig,
decidedly Whig, in both its branches Th<y, ac-
cordingly, mstiucted their Senators to vote for th<
repeal of the Independent Treamn and t c ill •
tnbution of the pr eeeds of the publ c landi amitt;
the several States, but they did not even atie ipt
t instruct ns in favor of a National Bank They
were asked by our fríen <s in the L«g slature ' why
do you not instruc your Senators on ih s gr< u
question'" Tney weie urged tocóme ip to th
point by the strongest appeals, but all 11 \am
They shrunk from the responsibility, kno*io¿ iha

rent of public opinion which could line (hi  can
didate into an avowal of friend hip f ¡   loe  Ir de
pendent Treasury, and   hostility    to a   National
Bank!
But tms "delibera e conviction" of the C mmU-
tee on ihe Currency is in direct opposition  to th-
deliberate opinion of 'he President ot   (he United
States, and I shall appeal from the judgment of the
committee to tha' of the head, at least the official
head, oi the party.   He h«s in subs'ance df clared,
in his late menage, what the history of the country
has demonstrated to be true, that the question of
establishing a National Bank has never yet been
presented distinctly beftre the people of the United
States,  with ut receiving their condem íation     I
shall not read this portion of the me sage, because
every Senator nalready familiar with it    In  the
Preiident'i. opinion, tne la e contest was decided on
well known prtnc ple«, but the creation of   a  Na
tional Bank was not ain<ng the number and most
assuredly he u correct in this latter opinion    In
the face, then, of all these facts, and many more
which might be adduced, what becomes oi the "de-
liberate conviction" of the committee that a vast
majority of the American people are anxiously so
hcitousltr the establishment of a National Bat k
It would be well for gentlemen who are really
the friends of such a Bank, to consider seriously
the consequences which may flow from the pas
sage of the bill at the pre*ent extra  ession     No
notice o'' such a mea ure was given in the procla-
mation of the President convening Congress   The
people did not expect it and hive never demande 1
it at jour hands    Public opinion is wholly unpr 
pared for it     And y et, at  this hot season of ihe
year,when we ought to be ad athome/here we are
confined in the Capitol, whilst the fuend-, of the
Bank are straining every nerve to "rush" it, pre-
maturely, through the forms of   legi lation, and
fasten it upon  a reluttant peopl       What will be
the consequences should the b II becoi e a law be-
fore our adjournment'    Why, sir, frcm every hill
and ind valley throughout the land—frim Georgia
to Maine, and from ihe Atlantic  to  the   Rocky
Mountains—the cry of "repeal" will be sitinded

ate a civil institution to be employed in the adminis
tration of the Government, or if 'he funds of th * Col
lege be public property, or if the Sate of New
Hampshire, as a Government, be alone interested
in us transactions, the subj ct is one in which the
Legislature of the State may act according to its
own judgment, unrestrained by any limita'ion of
ts power imposed by the Constitution of Le United
States "
But it required no judicial decision ti teach a
freeman this doctrire It never could be ima-
gined for a single moment that the Constitution of
the United States intended to enable Congress or a
Stite Legislature to transfer forever either to cor-
porations or to individuals those great and general
powers of Government with which ihey have bren
entrusted by the people If Congress can deprive
itself ly contract of any one of these powers, it may
di po e of ihe"i all, and that irrevocably, and the
National L°gislature might hus destioy itself,
and transfer all its most important func ions to
corpora ions. Such an idea cannot be toleiated fs.r
a moment
The only question, ther, would be, is this fiscal
agent, m the language of the latp Ch ef Justice, "a
civil institution, to be employed ta tha a Immigra-
tion of the Government'" Who can doubt it? Its
friends avow tiat it is an institution necessary for
the collection, safe keeping, transfer, and disburse-
ment of the public money, and that it alone can
furnish a sound and uniform currency, and regu-
late the fore gn and domest c exchanges of the
country Nay, more, us advocates admit that
Ibis corpoiation is constiluti >ral, on^y because it
can exercise these great and important financial
pjwers of Governm nt It viill be as much a
branch of'he Treasury Department as ever the
Independent Treasury was, a-d, like it, and all
other aet* o' Congress which re'ate to the great
publi- interests of the country, wnl be liable to re-
neal If the Government should think proper to
call m Ih  aid of private individúala to establish
this public fiscal corporation, their private interest
can never paralyze the arm of Congress or prevent
it from exercising its hifi legislative discretion in
repealing this law and substituting any other fiscal
agent wh en might, m its opinion, conduce mo¡e to
the interest ot the country
I speak sr lely of tie question of power, under
judicial decision , and 1 merely glance zt the suo-
ject for the present In the event o' repeal, the

Yes, sir,' repeal," "rep at," will be the cry every
