1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2291
by Colonel Graham, which will be found in
volume five of Senate Documents of the third
session of the Thirty-Fourth Congress, in the
year 1858. I read the following extracts:
"The immense amount of commerce before allurlcd
to, and which is shown by the accompanying statistics
to be dependent upon this channel for it? prosperity,
ought not to bo subjected to so long a delay m secur-
ing its practical benefits.
"Tho States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and tho
Temtoiy of Minnesota, have their shores washed by
thegreatinland seas; whoso intercommunication by
ship navigation is much interrupted by the want of
a safe and sure channel over these flats.
'* Tho States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and
a portion of Michigan, on the one side, are eripplcd
in their important commercial relations with tho
remaining portion of the State of Michigan, and with
the States of Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and
tho Territory of Minnesota, on the other side, by this
intervening obstacle.
" Something would seem, then, under the purview
of the Constitution, to be necessary to be done in
order to regulate tho commerce between these States.
Viowed in this light tho subject. becomes one of great
public concern. The value of the articles of com-
merce and navigation which passed over these flats
during tho two hundred and thirty days of open
navigation in the year 1855, say between the middle
of April and tho 1st of .December, will be presently
shown to havo amounted to the immenso sum of
$259,721,455 50, that is to say, two hundred and lifty-
ninemillionssevcn hundred and twenty-one thousand
four hundred and fifty-five dollars and fifty cents,
or per day during the navigable season SI,129,223 72.
The improvement, then, when undertaken should be
executed with a degree of permanency and celerity
combined commensurate with its importance and the
magnitude of the interests involved.
" It is making no moro than a reasonable allow-
ance for the cffect of tho obstruction to commerce now
existing atSt. Clair flats to say that had that«bstruc-
tion not existed tho value of tho merchandise and
produce that would have passed in 1855 would have
been full fifty percent, more than it actually was, or
that it would have amounted during the navigable
season of 1855 to S376.751.558 95. This would have
been an average value per day of &1,63S,050 25, or per
day more than three times tho estimated cost of tho
work to be done in a permanent manner, and with
a channel-way six hundred feet wide and lull twelve
feet deep. It should be bornem mind that such a
channcl would admit as free and safe a navigation
at night as during the day. In tho present state of
tho flats no navigator ever thinks of attempting to
pass them, except by daylight. Tim cause of deten-
tion, added to that of vessels grounded often for sev-
eral days before they can be got afloat and tugged
over, actually shortens the navigable season to quite
one half of what it will be when the improvement
shall be completed in the manner that shall best obvi-
ate all the difficulties."
Now, what are these St. Clair fiats, and
where are they? Lake St. Clair, which con-
nects by means of the Detroit and St. Clair
rivers the three lakes of Huron, Michigan, and
Erie, is eighteen miles in length, and has a
mean width of about twelve miles. The St.
Clair fiats are at the head of the lake. At the
point where the river widens itself into a lake
and forms the lake, sands brought down by the
flow of the river are accumulated. The flats
or sand-bars are made in that way; and a
channel of about one mile in length must be
cut through. For the last ten years nothing
has been done by the Government; nothing
since the date of the report from which I have
just read.
At that time a channel was cut through one
hundred feet wide and thirteen feet deep. That
channel is said to be to-day about fifty feet
wide and leu and a half feet deep. Now, the
value of the commerce which during the last
year passed over those flats was more than one
hundred and forty-six million dollars. But
that is exclusive of the value of the vessels,
wliich amounted to $*250,541,840 5 making the
total value of the property which passed over
those fiats in one season to be $390,540,890.
I desire to call the attention of the House to
a statement of this commerce over the fiats.
This statement, prepared by Mr. Edmund
Trowbridge—a brother, I believe, of my friend
from Michigan—conveys a very full and a very
minute idea of the value of this improvement:
"At the time the above appropriation was made,
1857. the average carrying capacity of the vessels on
the lakes was lrom ten to twelve thousand bushels
of grain, but tho rapid and enormous increase in the
commerce of the lakes has made it necessary to build
much larger vessels, and now it would be safe to say
the average capacity of each is double that amount.
Then tho greatest amount of water that vessels could
draw was from nine to ten feet, but now from twelve
to thirteen and a half feet.
"It is no uncommon thing to see several 01 our
argest propellers aground on tho flats at onetime,
working all tho powers of their engines to extricate
them&eh cs. The water being shallow, tho action of
their whoels digs up, as it were, thesauri underthem,
and deposits it in small hills or ridges in theehannel,
on which the next passing vessel is likely to stick
fast.
"Tho navigation of the rivers connecting Lakes
Erie and Huron has always been attended with much
risk, and olten with serious loss, owing to shoals,
sunken rocks, and swift currents, even before the
vessels were anything like the size they now aro.
This has made it necessary tobringrto the aid of sail-
ing vessels tow-boats to tow them through theso
ri^rs. Theso boats take in tow from two to seven
vessels, and in passing over tho flats tho tug, orsomo
of tho vessels 111 tow, are very apt to stick fast on
some of these ridges, formed by the propeller wheols,
or owing to the narrowncssofthochannel.thcystrike
on 0110 bank or the other, and, not having room to
work these vessels, tho consequence is, those astern
aro sure to com© in collision with thoso aground^
causing, in the aggregate, an immense amount ot
damage, all of which would be avoided by having a
sufficient breadth and depth of channel through which
to do tho business. Tho channcl is now so ciookcd
that it requires an oxpert pilot to tako any ordinary
sized craft over.
"Tho extent of tho bar or flat is very insignificant,
and the amount of money required from tho Govern-
ment is a mere trifile, when compared with tho 1111-
ppitance of the work sought to bo accomplished.
"The entire length that would be required to cut tho
channel would not exceed one mile. Your commit-
tee aro informed by competent engineers in thoGov-
ernment employ that the email sum of §200,000 would
give a channcl three hundred feet wide and fifteen
feet water.
"While your committee fully agree with and heart-
ily indorse all tho schemes proposed by conventions
and Boards of Trade to enlarge our canals, build new
ones, and open up greater facilities for getting the
vast produce of the West to tide-water, they cannot
but think that this work of enlarging the channel
over the St. Clair flats is of quite as great importance
as any that has been or can be propo^d.
"As it is, one vessel can entirely close tho channel by
strikingon one bank and swinging across theehannel,
thus effectually scaling if up,so lav as the parage oi
othcrvcsseis is concerned; and youi committee have
known within the last two years a large propeller
closing entirely the channel lor lour days, making it
impossible for any loaded cratt to pass or repass, and
detaining at one timcmorc than two hundred loaded
vessels tor that length of time. Your committee
would recommend that an appropriation of £200,000
bo asked from Congress to accomplish this much-
needed work.
"Your committee would also recommend that an
appropriation be a*k<d from Congress of a sufficient
amount of money to build three range lights on the
flats, in accordance with the recommendation ol Col-
onel William F. Raynolds, made to the Light-House
Board, which would enable vessels to pass over the
flats as well at night as in tho day. The necessity for
these range lights is proven irom tho tacl that tem-
porary ones have been kept there byprivato sub-
scription since the channel was opened. If not lor
them there would be large accumulation of vessels
above and below the flats during tho night, and at
tho earliest daylight each would try to he the first
over. They would meet on tho flats in such numbers
and to such an extent that there,would be an almost
interminable jam, and the damage irom loss of time
and collision would be incalculable.
" Hereafter your committee will show the number
of ve.-sels, with their cargoes, that have passed the
flats during the season of 1865, with the valuation of
the same as near as possible. In some instances wo
have been obliged to estimate the value of cargoes,
but feel assured that our figures aro below rather
than above the actual value.
"When we think that there are no le«s than fifteen
States of our Union directly or indirectly interested
in tho commerce of the lakes, it seems as though
they could, bv a united effort, demand of our Gov-
ernment that this barrier or obstruction should bo
removed, and that demand should not go unheeded.
"With the foregoing remarks your committee beg
leave to offer their statistical report, and would ear-
nestly recommend that the lepoit, orso^much of it as
is necessary, may bo laid before the difleront Boards
of Trade around the lakes, asking their cooperation
in bringing this important subject before Congress,
with a recommendation that the appropriation ot
$200,000 be made to remove this barrier, and a further
appropriation of HO,000 per year be made to keep
the channel open and clear for all times.

Your committee can form no definite ides, of the

Now, Mr. Speaker, it seemed right to say
thus much—it is onljr the beginning of what
might be said concerning these improvements
in the Mississippi and upon St. Clair flats to
