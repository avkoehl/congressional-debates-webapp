THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 28,
The rolling-mills 111 this country have all of them
more than double the capacity for heating and roll-
ing that they have for puddling. One ton of old
rails or wrought scrap takes the place of 1$ tons of
pig iron, depriving the ooal miner of the market of
the coal to smelt the ore and puddle the iron, dis-
penses with the ore and limestone miners, furnace-
men and puddlers; deprives the railroads of the
freights on coal, ore, limestone, and pig iron, and the
farmer and his laborers of the market of such con-
sumers. The following is a fairstatement of the cost
of iron made at the present time on tho Susquehanna :
2 tons coal, at $4 50  S9 00
2h tons hematite ore, §4 25  11 88
1 ton limestone  1 25
Furnace wages and expenses    7 00
Interest on capital  2 00
Cash    31 13
Freight to Philadelphia, agent's commission
for selling, and four months' interest on
notes  0 00
Now selling in Philadelphia, at $30, four
months $37 13
At Sireuil, Franco, the wages in 1866 were asfol
lows:
Francs per day.
Common laborers 2.50
Puddlers 8.00
Puddlers1 helpers 2,50
Puddle rollers 5.00
Shinglcrs 5.00
Francs per day.
Heaters 7.00
Heaters' helpers 2.50
Finishing rollers 6 to 7
Machinists .........3 to 3.50
Masons.. 5.00
With gold at 150 the present tariff was satisfac-
tory, and importations of English irons were light.
As gold has declined tho importations under the
present tariff have been as follows:
1868. 1809.
Pig iron $1,778,977 $2,171,869
Bar iron  2,906,231 6,675,397
Ilails iron  4,781,5(5 7,281,065
With gold at 115, the United States laborer has
lost a protection of $3 15 per ton on pig iron, and on
other descriptions in proportion to the duties. As 1
ton of imported old rails or wrought scrap takes the
place of If ton of American pig iron, tho duty should
be in the same proportion of II to 1. American pig
iron is now selling in Philadelphia at $6 per ton less
than it was in November, 1869. If this state of things
should continue tho furnaces must blow out and tho
employes be thrown out of employment.
I should think, counting upon some reduction in
tho price of coal, that an increase of duties over tho
present rates, of §2 per ton on pig iron, $3 per ton on
rails, old vails, scrap, bar, boiler-plate, and all other
descriptions of'iron would be sufficient to protect tho
labor of our country from sinking to the pauper level
of European wages. I do think that tho time has
come when the subject of tariff should bo considered
by all parties in a clear, business manner, forthegen-
eral good of tho whole country, and no longer argued
on theoretical grounds and party politics.
To carry out free trado or low tariffs we must havo
interest on money as low as it is in Europe, and we
must have wages as low. To effect tho latter we
mustdeprive our working classes of omploymcntand
buy only foreign goods until our laborers havo sunk
as low in poverty as the working classes in Europe,
and until they are willing to work for any pittance
rather than starve. Now, compare the comfortable
homes and well-dressed school children ot the work-
ingmen of to-day of this country with thoso of Eu-
rope in tho same employments, and the question
naturally arises, do we owe Europe, especially Eng-
land, so much gratitude for her conduct to us in tho
past, that wo should support her working classes by
purchasing their work until our own citizens are
reduced sufficiently low to bo compelled to compete
with them at the same low rates of wages or starve?
Very respectfully, yours, truly,

Hon. Judge Woodward,
House of Representatives, Washington, D. V.
Mr. ALLISON. Will the gentleman permit
me to inquire the business in which the writer
of the document just read is engaged?
Mr. WOODWARD. ^ My friend is entitled
to know the fact that this gentleman is an iron-
mabtcr, the superintendent of severallargeiron
works.
When in addition to these documents I have
exhibited some comparative statements as to
the wages of labor in England, France, Bel-
gium, and this country, I shall have got before
the committee the case I want to present for
their consideration. This work of comparison
is, as Mr. Wells states, extremely difficult and
often most unsatisfactory by reason of differ-
ences in the nomenclature, division, and hours
of labor in the different countries ; yet some
exceedingly interesting results have been ar-
rived at. He gives the following from the re-
port of A. S. Hewett, esq., United States com-
missioner to Paris, made in 1866. I take the
following statements:

In all other European countries wages are lower
than in the countries named.
It will bo observed that the wages in England aro
higher than in Franco, and in France higher than in
Belgium, and this is in accordance to tho tirao that
protection to homo industry has prevailed in these
countries. Franco finds it necessary to put a duty of
812 gold per ton on English and Belgium iron to pro-
tect her ironinterostor Abandon }t. Thoscllmgprice
of merchant bar iron in England is £6 10s per ton ; in
Belgium, LI, and in France. £8. Tho freight on iron
across the Atlantic to New York never exqeeds $5 a
ton. English merchant bar iron can bedclivercd at
New York at $40 por ton, while it costs $60, gold, to
put American bar iron there; and nearly the whole
of this differcnco consists in the difference in the rates
of wages paid hero and in Europe. Tho free trader
would say. " Abandon the business; " but the reader
must recollect that this difference exists in every
other branch of business, and we would then bo com-
pelled to abandon all kinds of manuiacturcs, unless
duties are imposed on European manufactures to
make up the difference, and thus protect our homo
industry.
Manufacture of cotton.—Average exccss of wages
paid in tho United States in 1867. gold, over thoso
paid for corresponding labor in Great Britain, 35s
per cent., and in 1868, 28.7 per cent.
In Belgium the average depression in wages, as
compared with the United, States, appears to bo
about 48 per cent.
In Franco tho average weekly earnings of persons
employed in manufactories of cotton are as follows:
Men, $4 27; women, 62 57; boys, 87 cents; and girls,
$1 04. Taking the 467 men and 1,446 women em-
ployed in that branch in Paris, tho avorage weekly
wages of adults is 14.9 j- francs, or £2 93; and includ-
ing the children the average is 13.82 francs, or $2 76.
Manufactureg of wool.—Tho average excess of
wages paid in woolen mills of the United States in
1867-68 over those paid for similar labor in Great
Britain was about 25 per cent., and in carpet and
other worsted mills 58 per cent.
Fire-arms.—The average weekly wages of all em-
ployes in the manufactories of lire-arms in the United
States, Great Britain, and France, in the year 1867,
were as follows: in tho United States, Remington's
and otlieih, $12 22; in Biimingham, England, $7 79,
and in Paris, $5 91. In this branch, therefore, the
rates of wages in the United States are 58 per cent,
more than m England, and 105 per cent more than
in France; while the rates in England aro 24 por
cent, in excess of thoso in France.
h on founding and machine building.—Average ex-
cess in wages paid in the United States in 1867-68
over those paid for similar labor in England, 58 per
cent.
Iron manufacture.—Price of puddling iron per ton
in New England, $5; in Now York, So 50? New Jer-
sey, $6; in eastern Pennsylvania, $6; western Penn-
sylvania, $6 75; in western States, $7 50; average
juice in currency, £6 12}-. Average price in gold,
United States, &4 37 J-: England, $2 87Belgium,
$1 20.
The average weekly earnings of puddlers in the
leading iron-producing countries are as follows:
United States, gold, $16 54; England, $8 75; France.
$8; Belgium,$6; liu3sia,(at the Yicksa iron Works,)
$1 93.
Unskilled labor,—The following are the average
rates for weekly wages paid for unskilled labor in the,
manufacturing establishments of the countries below
enumerated: in the United States, general average,
in gold, $6 81: in Great Britain, general average,

ony, (Dresden,) $2 25; Prussia, (Berlin,) $3 10; Rus-
sia, (atthe Vicksalron Works,) $1 33.
To my friend Mr. Nourse I am indebted for
the following statements :
America.
Puddlers' wages, $5 per ton; average 20 tons per
month for 10 months in the year, one third to pay to
11 Heaters average $i per day for 10 months in the
year; helpers. $2 per day.
Boss rollers, $4 50 per day for M months m the
yoar; under rollers, from Si 75 to $2 oO for 10 months
in tho year.
Laborers' wages about the same as furnace men.
jEngland.
In England puddlers will average 10 shillings per
ton, and will average 35 tons per month the year
round; holpers, 3 shillings and Gpenee perday—work
moro hours. o.i.-i
ltcators will averago£ll per month; helpers, Sshil-
linns por day. Girls employed for piling.
Boss rollers will average £25 per month; under
rollers will average from £10 to £18 per month.
Laborers will average about £1 per week.
All the labor in IV ales will average aboutlshilling
to tho pound less than in England.
Single board 1 shilling per day.
Now, Mr. Chairman, it is apparent from all
these document's that the proposition to reduce
duties on iron is nothing more nor less than tZ
proposition to bring down the wages of Amer-
ican labor to the standards of England, France,
and Belgium. It is said that 90 per cent, of
every ton of pig iron is labor. To attain to
the bliss of free trade in iron we must put our
coal and iron operatives on lower wages than
are paid similar workers in other countries,
because the rate of interest on money here is
more than double the current rates of Europe.
This circumstance operates to the prejudice of
labor and to the advantage of capital. Then
we pay our laborers in a depreciated currency,
which is another tax upon them. In England
the peasant gets as good a currency in kind as
the prince; but here wo keep our gold and sil-
ver for the bondholder and pay the laborer in
rags. Next we tax all he consumes, and thus
take back almost all the wages we pay. The
laborer pays to the Government, directly and
indirectly, a larger proportion of his income
than the capitalist. These wrongs result out
of legislation which is controlled by corpora-
tions and capitalists, and which isalmost utterly
uninfluenced by labor ; but grievous as these
wrongs aro you are not going to mitigate them
by striking down coal and iron.
I would ask my friends from New York, [Mi-
Brooks, Mr. Wood, and Mr. Cox,] who
pleaded so earnestly for reduction of duties on
eoal and iron, what they propose to do with the
30,000 miners in my county when they have
shut up the iron works ? The owners of the
coal mines and of many of the iron works are
their constituents, and they are rich enough to
live without income from their Pennsylvania
estates. They may find in the manifold advan-
tages of a wide foreign commerce a full equiva-
lent for the high dividends they get from coal
and iron: but what is to become of my con-
stituents, the miners? That question recurs
with awful emphasis, and must be answered.
Are they to regale themselves and families with
the theoretical beauties of free trade? Are we
to offer them a treatise on political economy
while we take away the bread they eat? "If
a brother or sister be naked and destitute of
daily food, and one of you say unto them, depart
in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwith-
standing ye give them not those things which
are needful to tho body, what doth it profit?"
Sir, these miners have been brought up to
the business and are unfitted to other employ-
ments. They have transported their families
to our country on the faith of legislation that
would employ them in their appropriate work.
Their form of labor is the most perilous of all
others, and, as the statistics show, is attended
with the largest percentage of accidents to life
1 and limb. They work for a bare subsistence,
