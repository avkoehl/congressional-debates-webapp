BALTIMORE, February 21, 1865-7 p. m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

In response to inquiries our agent at Cumberland advise, viz:

Generals Kelley an Crook were taken out of their beds about 3 o'clock by a rebel force variously estimated from 50 to 150, but I think there was not more than 50. They took the watchman at the depot and two operators, and kept them for some time. As soon as the watchmen got off he came and called me, which was about 4 o'clock. I got up and came down, but they had all left. Upon inquiry I found they had gone down the tow-path, after taking Generals Kelley and Crook and Adjutant Melvin, and 15 or 20 horses. The engineers of stock trains which were just arriving saw them. Our cavalry was sent in pursuit, and overtook them about Romney, but nothing definite is known. General Lightburn left here by a special engine about 5.30 a. m. for New Creek to send out parties to various points to guard the outlets. Only rebel officer heard of was a Lieutenant McNeill. Two stores were broken one, but not much damaged or goods taken. No interference with the running of trains. There are rumors of three rebel brigades-under Rosses, Lee, and Payne-in vicinity of Moorefield. It is unknown whose command was in Cumberland.

Up to this hour, 6.25 p. m., we have been unable to ascertain anything more definite.

Colonel HIGGINS, or

Brigadier-General LIGHTBURN,

The rebels have gone to Romney thorough Springfield. Send a force to Romney direct. Their horses much be tired, and if you hurry them u, and they ride very fast, they can head them off. Let them go at once; all that can be got off. Don's let there be a moment's delay. Please report when they get off.

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Colonel HIGGINS,

New Creek, Va.:

Send couriers after Major Troxel with orders to push forward with all haste to Moorefield. He may be able to compel the rebels to take the Wardensville road, and a force has gone from Winchester to Wardensville.
