Major-General MEADE:

The following dispatch, sent to Major-General Hancock, in reply to his inquiry whether Colonel Morgan had been ordered to report to him, shows the views that were entertained at these headquarters on the subject of your indorsement of this morning:

CITY POINT, VA., November 28, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Washington:

The order for Colonel Morgan to report to you has not been issued, but his leave of absence has been extended ten days. You will have to procure an order from the Secretary of War transferring Colonel Morgan from the Second Army Corps, so as to leave his position in that corps vacant, that it may be filled by General Humphreys, otherwise he will have to remain with the corps.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

General Grant will ask to have the order taking the medical director of the corps suspended. General Humphreys can appoint an acting inspector and recommend him for the place when Colonel Morgan is permanently detached from the Second Corps.

JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

He states that he heard some of his officers say that General Hampton with all his cavalry had gone to Georgia. They went last week. Nothing but rumor to substantiate this report. Everything else quiet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
