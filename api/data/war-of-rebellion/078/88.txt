Major Thomas T. ECKERT:

Trains arrived safely back at Lexington. Railroad cut between Cynthiana and Paris. Rebel forces estimated at 800. There is trouble on Louisville and Lexington road; also, passenger train burned near Smithfield this morning. From Burbridge's anticipated movements few days ago, I think he is now in rear of Morgan. Hobson is at Lexington. Mount Sterling was captured 5 o'clock this morning.

Brigadier-General Hobson reports the rebels under Morgan in Kentucky, 2,500 strong. They have occupied Mount Sterling and Paris, and are as far as Cynthiana. The guerrillas have burned some bridges on the railroad between Lexington and Louisville. I have ordered two regiments and a battery to report to General Hobson at Covington.
