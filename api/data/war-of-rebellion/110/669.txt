General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

By virtue of an agreement with the Governor of Mississippi, General Polk mustered into service of Confederate States three regiments and two battalions of State troops, numbeing 1,600 present for duty. Each company is below the minimum and organized for twelve months. Past two-thirds are liable to conscription. They have been received by General Polk and newly organized. Shall I recognize this transfer?

RICHMOND, VA., May 6, 1864.

(Via Montgomery.)

His Excellency Governor CHARLES CLARK, of Mississippi,

Macon, Miss.:

Your dispatch received. I have long recognized the patriotic services of General Gholson, and it will give me pleasure to nominate him for the brigade transferred by you to the Confederate service.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

[39.]

DEMOPOLIS, ALA., May 7, 1864.

His Excellency President DAVIS:

General Lee has just arrived. I learn from him that he is ranked by General Mayry. This may have been overlooked at Richmond. It is of the greatest importance that in the approaching collision that we should have the use of the services of all our best men that can be spared. I voluntarily suggest, from knowledge of department and the disposition made for its defense, that the officer commanding at Mobile can easily take charge of and administer it. To be deprived of General Lee's services in the campaign before us wo9uld be a serious loss to the service. If agreeable to the government he would like to accompany me, and I may add there are other reasons why he should be permitted to take the field. My troops are being pressed forward. Will you please let me have an early answer?*

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
