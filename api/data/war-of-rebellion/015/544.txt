be adopted. My troops will be well posted, so as to carry out instructions or to meet an advancing enemy. We need more artillery and re-enforcements if possible. Expect further advices hourly, and will forward information.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

WINCHESTER,

June 12, 1862-10.45 a. m.

Dispatch of this morning, 1 o'clock, confirmed by subsequent reports. General Crawford reports two brigades at Front Royal instructed to leave when two of our brigades relieve them. In the changed aspect of affairs I think they should remain until instructed by you, and have so suggested to General Ricketts, in command. If the enemy attacks it will be immediate. Dispatches passed through town from General Fremont, which doubtless inform you fully. I will place my command so as to comply instantly with your instruction received to-day from Adjutant-General, or meet the enemy if the advances.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WINCHESTER,

June 12, 1862-2 p. m.

Our messenger just returned from headquarters. General Fremont confirms all essential statements of my dispatch this morning. General Greene's brigade is here.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, June 12, 1862-10.40 p. m.

Major-General BANKS, Winchester:

Your telegram has just been received. It is not believed to be possible that Jackson has any such re-enforcements as 30,000 or 35,000. McClellan says that two regiments were sent from Richmond to Jackson. What can be the necessity of your falling back before Fremont reaches you? If you abandon Front Royal and your present position, do you not afford a gap for Jackson to pass through as before? The President directs that you hold your position until further developments.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
