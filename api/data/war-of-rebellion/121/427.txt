Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Lieutenant John T. Stevenson, Second Missouri Infantry, is now and has been a prisoner at Johnson's Island since August 15, 1862. He was captured at Versailles, Ky. You are aware that by the agreement of exchange entered into between Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow and myself on the 10th of January, 1863, "all officers and men captured in Kentucky, &amp;c., up to December 10, 1862, were declared exchanged". It was further agreed that if any such were in Federal prisons they should be released. I therefore ask that Lieutenant Stevenson be delivered without any unnecessary delay.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

OFFICER COMMANDING FEDERAL FORCES, Jacksonville, Fla.:

Under an agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war recently entered into between Lieutenant-General Grant, commanding U. S. Army, and the authorities of the Confederate Government, which is now being rapidly carried into effect in the eastern portion of the States, I propose to deliver a portion of the Andersonville prisoners at Jacksonville, Fla. The object of this communication is to certain if you will receive them there and receipt for them as paroled prisoners for exchanged. The route of travel to that point will be less fatiguing to the Federal prisoners than any other at present open. Captain John C. Rutherford, the bearer of this communication, is directed to deliver it and to bring me your answer. I will make every necessary preparation for the comfort of the prisoners during the trip which is possible. Please let me have your answer as promptly as practicable.

Respectfully,

GID. J. PILLOW,

Brigadier General and Commissary-General of Prisoners, C. S. Army.
