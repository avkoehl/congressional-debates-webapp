APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL 6MBE,

fcrrH Cong**.  1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Clay.
Senate.
Bortanee, 411 my humble judgment, than all the rest, to con
ciliatethepabhc confidence and support, and to secure to tins
new ms ltuuon a career of extended, useful, and harmonious
operation Assert no odious or questionable power in its crea-
tion. Do not implant m it, at its birth, a principle of contes-
tationand force Let it have the free and consentaneous sup
port of all the elementa of our mixed institution —of 8 ate
anü of Federal power harmoniously blended Thus, and thus
only, will it become, what all must wish to see Rf a national,
and not a party, mentation, shielded by public opinion from
those fierce political storms which marred the usefulness
and finally overwhelmed in violent convulsions both, of us pre-
ctoossors
Mr CLAY of Kentucky addressed the Sánate I regret, said
be, extremely, that the Senator from Virginia [Sir Rives] has
felt himaelf constrained, by a. sense of duty, to submit this
amendment No good—n ¿thing, I fear, but unmixed mischief
^caneóme out of it, although I am quite sure that i=  far from
the inteution of the ¡senator The people want at our hands a
Bank—a real old fashioned Bank, such an one as they and their
fatdtrs have tried, and experienced the benefits of Now the
institution, the proper organization of which we aie consider-
ing, is to be a National Bank or a local Bank If it is to be a
National Bank, wc have the power to make it, or we have
íioi ¿i we have the powei if the States have already
consented, in the Constitution, to the establishment of a National
Bank, no further oi other consent fiom them is necessary Irj-
d<wd, if they nave not already given their assefU m the Consti
tution, they cannot give it in any mode other than that which
the Internment itself prescribes, according to which there must
b« the concurrence ofthiee fourths of the States This, I think,
is too clear for argument If we have no powei to make an un
disguised National Bank, we ought not to attempt it We ought
not to seek to accomplish indirectly what we ait- not authorized
or forbidden to do directly This District of len miles square
w« placed under the juusdiction of the Geneial Government,
that the Federal authority might govern it, not that, by means
of the local jurisdiction, the whole Union should be governed or
controlled We ought not to apply a power granted for one
purpose to the attainment of anothei puipose, foi which it is
not granted I do not think, then, that we can estabhbh a local
Bank, and impart to it national*facuUiesor functions But the
Bank wfaich the Senator from Vnginia proposes, is manifestly
a mero local bank of the Distuct of Columbia The Senatoi
might have epaied himself some time inpiovingihe power of
Congress to establish such a Bank 1 here can be no doubt of
theexisten.ee oi Mich a power It Ins been agunand a°ame\

ground or pimciplecan we placo out i unification for not exer-
cising the power, without the previous consent of the States,

bUshed the rule that, pnoi to theexeicide of the constitutional
power to establish a B ink, wo muM obtain ti e consent of the
States, what at l the limitations, if any, to the rule?   Mu&t we
not abk the previous const nt of the Ss&tes in evtiy instance of
the exercise of the puwers granted m the Consti mion to the
Fedeial Government?   It we piopj^c to Cbtabli h a post o flue,

at the close of the contest, refuses to exercise ihe powtr, will it
not be hereafter const) tied asa virtud oi implied relinquish

Bank, a rickety, imbiciJ**, incompetent ¡oca! bank, which, I
think, cannot lail fo disappoint the hopes ard expectations of

ken of the consenting State by the Senators proposed amend
ment Itisapartot thatamendment that, when an office of
discount and deposite is once established m a State, with the
consent of the otate, "the office shall not be withdrawn with-
out the assent of Confess " Now, if your power be incom
petent to p'ant an office of discount and deposite within the
limits of aState, «without the consent of the State, how, after it
is put there, cm yon hold and maintain it there in spite of and
against the will of the State?
[Here Mr Kivss interposed, and said that it was a part of
the compact made between the goveieign State and the Bank.)
Mr Clay continued Suppose it is, whence do you deuve
your authority to enforce any contract made between a sove
reign fetate and a corporation? If you are forbidden by|| he
Constitution to place a branch m a State, can you delegate
such an authority'1 Can you, in othei wouls, delegate what
you have not toa corporation"* Forbidden to effect an objec*
dupe ly, can you achieve it indirectly)
The project of the Senator from Vngmia proceeds upon the
supposition that the Constitution has not eranted any power to
Congress to ebtabhsh alsationa! Bank If, therefore, a hi ai ch
is admitted within aState, it is there in virtue of the \\jll, un
der the authonty of the laws, and subject to the juried etion of
that State It is, consequently, amen ibie to, and may be dealt
with by, the power ol the 'üiaie, accoiíbrg o ifce pleasure of
the State The Senator lnquned if it weie not competent to
Great Btitain to admit, if she pleased the establishment of a
bianch or office of a Hank of the Untied States within her
limits? Mo t undoubtedly she may, and n would be an analo
gouscase to the admission of such a branch by a State Upon
the supposition of the admission of such a branch, would it
not be aubject to the Paihament 6f Grot Bn ami Could the
fact that the coi poration, whose branch was thus íeceived,
wascteated by a foreign sovereignty exert any lestiamt upon
the power of the Bimsh Pail ¡anient in dealing, is it pleased,
with the alien or emipi ant branch which it had thus received?
The branch, located within the Sute by he consent of the
State toall intents and purposes woullbc a local institution,
governed by the local laws I hat, I think, would be the cape of
any branch uncondmon illy admitted by the Lecislaiuie «fa
State But, if you oraanizea Bank within th s J) stucf, ard,
m the teimsof itschartei, announce to the States tliu bianches
( in only be admitted wiihm the i limit? by tneir  eon&ent and
authuity you necessanly invoke the scveial States to delibe
i iu on the question of ldmisMin whieh they ue thus called
upon to decide And, if (hey may eonsentoi not consent, ac
cudine to their option, they may co s 'nt absolutely oi upon

Another question of ereat import mce would be the degiee of

is «eveitheless, no'hing moie noi l*¡ s thin a Bank of the Dis
tnctofC'lumbia If it should have iny e-xterioi action, through
(frit e oi agencies situate beyond tl e Dis net, tr-a exteiioi ¿e
tion would not lesult fiom tne legislation of Congress, hu'
from the legislation of the States by which their consent was
granted to ratablish these omcev or agencies within then iimi g
And the States would hava just as much a righ* to allow of
these offices or agencies, whether th*re wa* any grant ffsm
Congress or not to the corporation, in its charter, to establish
them For there can be no d jubt I presume, th it the Bank of
the Metropolis might now establish such an office or agency in
any State that would permit it, notwithstanding the sitenceof its
ihaiter on that subject The Pennsy'vama Bank of theUni*
ted Mates, it has been understood has or had its agencies in other
States, which mubt have depended solely upon the toleration
of their laws
No amendment to the charter, made by the committee, has
commanded from the Senatorfrom Virginia warmer common
dation than that which denies ta ihe parent bank all power of
discounting within the District, and compels uto transact that
part of the business of banking, through us othces beyoindthe
District Considered as a National Bank with branches, ema-
natmg from and protected within the States by the national au-
thor ty, I think that feature is worthy of all the Senator's ad
miration But if it is to be regarded asa mere District bank,
springing from the power of local legislation poss ssed by Con
gress, it would be certainly a most anomalous if not ridiculous
featuie In this view ofn, Congress will have made, in virtue
of its local power of legislation, a great DiStnct hank, which is
stiipt of all essential power of banking within the District,
and transacts ail of us impoitant busmes* bevond the bounda
nesof the Distnrt We shall hive made a sort of monster,
indeed, with a body, destitute of life, animation, or action
where it abides, but which may throw out ail around it into
the States its long and huge pawsoi branches to conduct ihe
m«st extensive operations theie' Mr President, is this such a
National Bank as the people of the United States expect horn.
Congress?            ^                                                      fifc
Ihe Senatoi fiom Virginia has invoked a spirit of ^Kes
sion, compromise and conciliation in our dehbeiations I be
lievf, su, that I have not been heietofore found wanting in
yielding to the u iluence of euch a spirt But there aie some
cases of pnnciple whuh admit of no compromi&e, aid I fear
that this isone The question is, a ]\ aliona] Bankor no Na-
tional Bank, constitutionality or unc nstitutionahiy, power or
no power How tie these opposite properties or qualities to
beiedonciled or compro/niseo? There is no mean or middle
term If you esiabi sh nally a Ñauen ! Bark, emanating
fiom sustained and protected bv, the row r of Congress, and
opeut! tig within the fc ites without then contentor control,
thobo whodoiy the existence of he constitutional power of
( ongrp--8 to construct such m msinutinii aie d s atufied, and
think they are called upon to Meld every thing And, on ihe
othei hand, if you establish a mere Dibit ict bank, wuh branch
mg powersm the States dependent upon then will the lnends
of the constitutional power of Congnssthmli that you mi ck
the people with an incompetent institution, and call upon them
to sm rende i eveiy thing
And this, it seemfl ti me, is the soi t of coreas on oi coin pio

[Here Mt Hives said the an endment he proposed was re
ported by thefeecretaiy of ths Trei^Uiy ]
That is true, and the Senatoi is entitled to all the benefit he
can derive from that fact 1 feel quite sure, however, that the
becretary does not entertain a different opinion of the consti-
tutional power of Congress fr >m ems I must, then, entreat
the Senator from "Virginia to/niñear piecing his amendment,
and, if he cannot £iv« up his own pemtiai opinion, to leave
us in the uudistuibed enjoyment of oui long cherished corvic
