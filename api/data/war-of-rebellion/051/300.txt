light artillery. I am now deploying to fight them. They have infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Charged once on our cavalry and broke it. Infantry deployed in front.

S. A. M. WOOD,

Brigadier-General.

[P. S.]-I think it an advance in force, and we should be supported.

General W. W. MACKALL:

GENERAL: I am moving Cleburne's division out to Dug Gap. Should the Yankees be attacking there in force, it would be a good time for Hindman to attack in rear.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Lieutenant-General.

SEPTEMBER 10-4.25 a.m.

General MACKALL:

GENERAL: Your dispatch was near five hours reaching here by my time, which is slow. It is 11 miles from here to the cross-roads. The road is blockaded from the top of the mountain to the foot several miles. Cleburne is sick; was in bed all day yesterday. Two of his best regiments are with Buckner's column, not having come up from picket duty above Harrison. More than two of his regiments are on picket at the different gaps in Pigeon Mountain. Under the circumstances, I have not ordered the movement, as it could not possibly be simultaneous. Either Hindman should be stopped or the movement postponed till to-night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. H. HILL,

Lieutenant-General.
