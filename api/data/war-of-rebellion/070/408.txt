CUMBERLAND, MD., May 8, 1864-2 p. m.(Received 2.25 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

I received orders from the Secretary of War on the 6th instant directing me to assume command of all the troops guarding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad west of Monocacy, and that I would receive orders from you what additional troops would be assigned me. Not having heard from you I deemed it proper to send this telegram. Do I understand that I am to report direct to you?

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, May 8, 1864.

Captain THAYER MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Winchester:

The general's telegram in cipher was dully received, but not having cipher book I sent it back to Captain Mathews to be deciphered. Not troops have yet reported from Ohio. When they arrive I will dispose of them along the line of road at such points as are weakest. I will exert all energy possible to protect the road and facilitate the transit of troops and supplies to the general, that his expedition may prove a success.
