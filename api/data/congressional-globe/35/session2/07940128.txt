terest in this subject, in consequence of the great
benefit, as I have shown, that is to flow to trade.
The extension of commerce is not only important
to national wealth, power,and prosperity, but is
also the great lever which conquers and maintains
peace and tends to bind the nations of the earth
ip.perpetual amity.

INDIANA ELECTION QUESTION.
DEBATE IN THE SENATE.
Monday, February 14, 1859.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
cause the whole state of the question, from the
beginning, to be laid before the Senate. The
Committee on the Judiciary concluded their re-
port by this request:
" That the committee ask to bo discharged from the fur-
ther consideration of the memorial of the Legislature of In-
diana."
JThe Senator from New York [Mr. Seward]
has proposed to amend this proposition by striking
out all after the word " that," and inserting:
Henry S. Lane and William M. MeCarty have leave to
occupy seats on the floor of the Senate pending the discus-
sion of the report of the Committee on the Judiciary on the
memorial of the Legislature of Indiana, deelaung them her
duly elected Senators; and that they have leave to speak
to the ments of their rights to seats, and on the report of the
committee.
It is proposed by the Senator from Ohio [Mr.
Pugh] to amend that amendment by striking out
j all after the word "that," and inserting:
' The resolution of the Senate, adopted June 12, 1858,
affirming the right ol Graham N. Fitch and Jesse D,
Bright as Senatois elected from the State ot Indiana, the
former until the 4th davof March, 1661, and the latter until
the 4th dav of March, 1863, was a final decision on all the
pietni*es then in eontioversv, and conclusive as well upon
the Legislature of Indiana, and all persons claiming under
its authority, aa upon the Semuois named in the resolution.
The question is upon the amendment to the
amendment.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. My wish is, as 1 have
before expressed it to the Senate, to give these
gentlemen an opportunity of being heard. The
| inclination of my opinion is against them. The
i inclination of my opinion is, that the decision
] which has been heretofore rendered is conclusive
I upon all parties; but still, upon that question I am
! willing to hear these gentlemen, ft seems by this
i course, however, that it is impossible for the;Sen-
I ate ever to arrive at a vote on that proposition.
; It appear* to me there mast be something wrong
i in a course of proceeding which denies to the
Senate an opportunity of voting on a matter of a
character so integral and distinct in itself. I wish
to know if i can by any means arrive at the vote
on that point. This amendment, offered by the
Senator from Ohio, cuts me off entirely from the
vote which I desire to give. I deMie to hear these
gentlemen, I cannot do it under this amendment.
If this amendment is carried, I can never vote
upon the question that I desire to vote upon. If
there be any way by which I can arrive at that
question, I should like to know it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair can only
reply to the Senator from Kentucky, that the
questions appear to him to be presented here in
an orderly manner, and he must recognize these
amendments as they are offered. The question
now is on the amendment to the amendment of-
feted by the Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BAYARD. Mr. President, I differ from
the honorable Senator from Kentucky. The re-
port of the committee has not been read, but it
has been printed; and I take it for granted that
that honorable Senator, as well as others, have
read it, and I shall therefore not call for its read-

* Equated from the trade of England, France, and the
United States.
That report was made on the memorial of the
Legislature of Indiana, representing that they had
chosen to revise the decision of the Senate of the
United States made at the last session; and that,
subsequent to this revision, they had proceeded,
on the22d day of December last, to elect Senators
to this body. It seems to me that the question
which necessarily arises as a preliminary question,
before any claimant can be heard on this floor,
is, whether the Senate will reconsider their decis-
ion of the last session, made by solemn resolution,
00,000 | and which affirms the right of the sitting mem-
2.7.">o!ojO !! hois to their seats as Senators until 1861 and 1&63,
2.100,003 j; respectively. Until that question is decided, there
l can be no claimant before the Senate.
1 The committee hove given their reasons why
' the decision of the Senate is irreversible, because
it proceeds on the same state of facts, the same
matter of contest upon which the Senate, after de-
bate, deliberately decided at the last session; and
they consider the decision conclusive. If that be
