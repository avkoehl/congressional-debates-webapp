industry, of the very Indian fighters whose cause I
now endeavor to plead
The same Western men who had continued the
contest throughout the Revolution, and down*to the
treaty of Greenville in 1795—a period of twenty
years—were the first to unlock the gates and open
the avenues to the ''far West," by which a safe
and permanent entry was made into the North-
western territory They were, emphat cally, the
van guard to the emigrating multitude, who, m
search of a home and a competency, flocked
to the Western country , a  the approach of
whom, the affnghtened natives, pressed at the
point of the bayonet, retreated with hasty step^
to the banks of the Mississippi, (hereby affording
partial security to the bold and enterprising ad-
venturers
What, I would asir, was the situation of the
West in 1795? A deep and almost interminable
wilderness—"where the boughs of the ¡otty buckeye
waving in the wind served but to swell the melan
choly notes of solitary nature," where a monoto-
nous silence ever reigned, save wnen disturbed by
the howl of beasts of prey, or the more hideous
yell of savage man'
But, Mr Chairman, never was transformation
from the long silence of the forest, to the active,
cheering, busy scenes of civilized life, &0 sudden,
rapid, and so radical. Mil! ons of freemen in the
full enjoyment of all the comforts, and, I may add,
all the luxuries of hf°, pre now spread over that
extensive and diversified country, and if we may
be permitted to glance at futurity, and measure
the probable increase of population by the ratio of
the past, the time is near when a majority of the
inhabitants of ihe United S a es will be found m
the valley of the Mississippi
Will Congress continue to disregard the claims
of this meritorious class, after having provided for
every ether description of soldier' Will you do
this, too, at a ame like the presen', when we are at
peace wi h all the world, the national debt paid off,
the country m the full tide of a prosperity unex-
ampled in any nation, with a population exceeding
seventeen millions, in the full enjoyment of all the
blessings and immunities which Providence, in the
plenitude of its goodness, has capacitated man to
ernoy? I will not believe it1 I think I know too
well the liberal and honorab'e feelings of gentlemen
of botb parties It is a subject elevated iar above
the part) feuds which too often enter this hall, pnd
prevent ac'ion upon importan t measures I am sure
the hydra-monster party will not be permitted to
interfere in this sacred question Will the North-
ern man hesitate to place these claimants upon an
equal footing with the thousands of pensioners in
his own section, where three-fifths of the pension
fund is expended' Surely his sense of justice will
forbid it' Shall we appeal in vain to the gene
rous South on this occasion? No, sir, she has
ever been feelingly shve to the claims of the war-
worn soldier, and her liberality, which is prover-
bial, wi'lnot bewithhe'don this—perhaps the last—
apptal in behalf of some of the few who remain
unprovided for To Western gentlemen I have
nothing to say, the scenes which I have feebly at-
tempted to describe are all familiar to them The
first impressions made upon their juvenile minds,
were derived from the the traditionary history de-
tailed by their fathers, in which the thrilling inci-
dents of Indian warfare were feelingly and elo-
quently detailed And although no costly edifice
or marble monument points to the place or com-
memorates the battle field of these heroes, yet their
memory will be cherished in the bosom of every
Western man, long after the most stately temples
shall have been mouldered away by the ravaging
hand of time
I will only add, in conclusion, that, if au^ht be
done to smeoth the short but ragged path which
intervenes between the aged man and the grave, it
must be done quickly The fell destroyer, death,
is rapidly removing him from earth, and hurrying
him to "that bourne from whence no traveller re-
turns '"
On reference to the report of the Secretary of
War, it will be seen that more than two thousand
pensioners have died during the last year. The
number pensioned under the act of 1818, has de-
creased from about twenty thousand to less t&an
eight thousand. Of those pensioned usder the act
of June 7, 1833, eight thousand six hundred and
nine have died Out of eleven hundred and eighty-
iix pensioned unier the act of 1828, only six hun-
dred and five remain
A few short years, and the la«t relics of Revolu
tionary  times will have  been gathered to  their
fathers, the most of them having spent their latter
d'ys in penury and  want,  and dropped into the
grave "unwept, unhonored, ard unsung1"
Will an American Congress permit these things
to transpire? If so, oar lips should be hermetically
seal d when the charge shall be repeated, which has
been so often gratuitously made by the enemies of
free Government—that' Republics are ungrateful'"
