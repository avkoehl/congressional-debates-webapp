regiment, the State to which it belongs, whether mounted or foot, volunteers, or militia; the name of the colonel or permanent commanding officer; by whom, and under what act of Congress it was called into service; where and when enrolled, and the term to be served; by whom, where, and when, or in what month, the company was organized; and (with the exceptions shown in the forms below) when it arrived at the general rendezvous, and the distance between that and the place of organization, and when discharged. The muster-rolls for payment will show the time for which the muster is made, as the first one from date of enrollment, and subsequent ones from the time the company was "last paid" (without regard to any intermediate muster) to the time the new muster is to be made-generally for two months-but more or less according to circumstances.

2. The following is the purport of the captions for the several kinds of musters which may occur.

3. The words and figures between brackets [] throughout are inserted to make the meaning of the caption and remarks clear; the appropriate ones will be used on the rolls.
