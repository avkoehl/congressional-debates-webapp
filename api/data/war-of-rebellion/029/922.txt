superior. As the commanding general only reported a simple fact communicated by your immediate commander, and which you substantiate and admit, he cannot see that any injustice is done you. Any explanation of the delay you acknowledge will be forwarded to form a part of the report of the battle.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. WALTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure C.]
HEADQUARTERS CHEATHAM'S DIVISION, Shelbyville, Tenn., June 1, 1863.

Major General JOHN P. McCOWN, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

GENERAL: In answer to your inquiries, I have to state I was directed by General Hardee to point out to you a position for General McNair's brigade, which I did just before dark and Tuesday evening, placing his right, resting on the Triune road, on a line with Colonel Loomis' brigade, which was in the front line of Polk's corps. The position of McNair's brigade was somewhat of a curved line, as will be seen by the accompanying map. You requested that General Hardee would indicate the position for McNair, which I agreed to do at General Hardee's request. The right of McNair's brigade was on the front line of Polk's corps, but about 100 or 120 yards in rear of the line occupied by General Ector on the lane. His left was in the direction of Ector's right.

Very respectfully,B. F. CHEATHAM,

Major-General, C. S. Army.
