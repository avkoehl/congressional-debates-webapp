neglect and violation of his public duty, and I say

knowledge what my cry means I have been

to printing the document     Why'    Has he íe id
it'    Has it been si nt to the peopl  '    Has one in
a hundred of them ever looked into it'   To hear
the gentleman talk, one would  think  they had
gone tlnough the document—masticated it, and
digested alt it contains, and yet they are as igno  '
lant of it as their constituents, who never saw i
the outside of the book, oi ever heard of what is
¡nside     Still they cry' useless'useless1 extiav
agant "'
Ihe gentleman fiom Maiyland says that theie
have always been defalcations, that they ran
through all Administrations,fiom the foundation
of the Government But that has nothing to do
with the question I propose to print only what
have happ ned between the years 1834 and 1838
Has that gentleman, I wondei.ioigotten that this
Administration came into powei in 1829' Iiathei
think not Well, sir, I give him up all the inter-
val, from 1829 to 1834, yes, sn, five years'grace
Though this Administration was conceived and
born in sin, and has grown up in manifold in-
iquities, I will give him a space like that required
for the growth of the moras multicauhs, I will not
touch his plant till its stem is firm and its fibers
well compacted,anditsleavesfullandflourishing
And after that—since 1834—1 will show him sixty
cases of defalcation, fully known to this Secretaiy
of the Treasui y ,where the defaulters were warned,
watched, reproached, thieatened, forgiven, and
their defaults, while still existing and continued,
in some cases actually sanctioned by a renom-
IMATION TO OFFICE
Sir, the gentleman actually objects to printing
a report of the Secretary of the Ti easury' What,
sir, has it come to this' Have you a Secietary
whose repoits cannot bo relied on—whose reports
you dare not print lest you spiead befoie the peo-
ple a libel'
Mr THOMAS I certainly said no such
thing
Mr WISE Why, sir, the gentleman made
such ob]ections to printing one of these reports
as actu illy induced me to stuke it out of my res-
olution I did so on his own argument, that the
document contained false mfoimation
Mi   THOMAS     I said " erroneous "
Mi WISC Well, you may be as gentle m
your teims as the Secretary himself to his de
faulting subalterns, it does not altei the matter
The gentleman fiom New York [Mi Cambre-
ltvg] did say, that to print the documents would
be to publish a multitude of libels on good and
honest citizens The reports of youi Secietary,
then, uie to be suppiessed for false and libelous
m ittti Did I evci make a worse charge agunst
youi Secictaiy' Was ever a grossei charge made
against a man at the litad of the most important
De partment of the Government than that his
fricnus are undci the necessity of suppiessing his
public official repoits' Veuiy it is time we had
a chmge of men What' a Secretaiy of the
Tie asm y, whose duty it is to send to this House
nothing but true and authentic mtoimation touch-
ing things undci his supervision and cognizance,
to send here a document which his own friends
daie not send abioad, because it is false and li-
belous' ¡an, I believe what the gentlemen say
of that document I hough the documtnt No
111 shows gross neglect and gieat incoirectness
in the rtcoida of his Depaitment, yet I do believe
it dots exhibit many men as public defaultcis
who aic ne)t defaulie ra, nay, the veiy reverse I
haie therefore stneken document No 111 out of
my ¡esolution
But, sir, no such objection applies to document
No 297, which contains this precious correspond-
ence Gentlemen cannot, will not, dare not say
that Mr Woodbury has hbtled himself They
dare not deny Ins signattue He did not forge
his own name, 1 suppose No, sir, no plea can
be put in here of item est factum
The gentleman fiom Maiyland says that no
paity in particular is to blame for these defalca-
tions, because defatcations have happened under
all parties Will the gentle man I  so good as to
tell us what pai ty was to blame in the case of the
leeeivti, Linn' 1 hat man was guilty of malvei-
sation, the Secietiry knew it, and threatened
hmi,and thenlenommated him for anew appoint-
ment lie was confirmed, and, again proving
in default, was warned again and again and
again, and, aftei all, continued in office till he
finally fell into the slough oí defalcation Was
no paity to blame for this ' Or is it the villain-
ous Whigs who are to blame foi thus lewaidmg
a public elepredatoi' The gentleman, however,
siys that some defaultcis have been Whigs, and
some Locofocos, they have been men oí all pai-
ties I answei,not under this Admimstiation
I ask the gentleman to point out o\e It has
been said that fewartwout was a Conservative
Be that as it may, he was one of the very gieat-
est of allGeneial Jackson's favorites,lie was his
open, active, clamoious advocate, and did more
to effect his election to the Presidency than any
other man in the State of New Yoik, if not in the
United Stites, and he was rewarded for it to his
heait's content Sn,the gentleman cannot show
us a solitary Whig among all the defaulting re-
ceivers at the western land offices I will show
the gentleman, if he will print this document,
where one oí the defaulters gives it openly to the
Secretary, as his excuse for not paying over a
laige amount of public money in his hands, that
his Democratic friends advised him not to leave
the ground till aftei the pi esidential election which
brought Mr Van Buren into power But admit-
ting that they were Whigs, tveiy one of them,
does that justify or excuse a Secretary of the
Tressuiy in continuing men in office who, as 1 e
well knew, were diverting the public money to
their own use—shaving w ith it—speculating on
it—and in renominating them to office while still
defaulters' in permitting one of his peiambulat-
lng agents to advise him to retain a thief in of-
fice, because his hands weic now full, and he
would steal no more, whereas a new hand would
only follow his example' And is it to be an
excuse for the thefts of one party, to sav, " well,
you stole too'" I do not know one Whig in
all this document of defalcations, if theie were
a hundred, is this an argument to be used heie '
Is this the salt that is to cuie the coiruptions of
Admimstiation men' The chaige is, that the
party picked out these men, appointed them to
office, and held them in office, while they were
picking and stealing, until their " hands were
full " And what is the answer' " You pick
and steal too " How many Whigs they may
have bought up by the hopes of such golden op
portuoities, I cannot say, perhaps many But I
put it to the honor and the mtegnty of the proud
and honorable gentleman fiom Maryland, a man
who would disdain to become a defaulter him-
self, to say whether this is a fit argument for him
to put foith in defense of such an officer as Mr
Woodbury' Sn, it is the strongest of all dem-
onstrations of the state of morals to which the
party is reduced For myself, I despise a Whig
tlnet as heartily as any other
Mr THOMAS lam sure the honoiablegen-
tleman fiom Virginia does not intend willfully to
misieprtsent me, but he has now certainly put
me m a false position 1 said that men oí all
political parties, and under every successne
Admimstiation, had been found public de<aulteis,
some of them under the Admimstiation of the ven-
erable gentleman behind me, [Mr Adams ]
Mr WISE 1 understand the gentleman's po-
sition perfectly it is, that defaulters have not be-
longed to one party alone Well, sir, and whit
dots that aigument amount to' Analyze it, and
it comes to precisely what I say The charge on
his party and his Secretary is, that they knew of
these enoimous defalcations, and connived at
them, and the answer to that is, " theie always
have been defaulters of all parties " Can a gen-
tleman of mtegnty rely on such a defense ' lhe
true answer would be, "your party and your
Secretanes knew as well as we, and they con
nived at defalcations just as we have done'" Thai
would be an answer But can it be said ' is it
true' will the gentleman say it' Ido not, in mj
call, go back an inch beyond 1834, and I show
the defalcations were not only multiplied anc
enoimous, but that they were tolerated and con
nived at Now let the gentleman show us any
other Secretaiy of the Tieasury, from Washing-
ton's days, who did the like Let him produce
us a Secretary who ever before repoited to Con-
giessthathe knew of cases, by fifties and by hun-
dieds, where his subordinates were faithless and
conupt, and yet that he xetained them in office,
and renominated them when their term expired,
and that they still went on to plundei, and were
still íetained, till the money was finally lost Let
him show us that Show me one such case, and
then he may talk of precedents for an offense
which no precedents can justify
I do show him such proof against his officei,
and now when I ask that tins pi oof, so plain, so
conclusive, so undeniable, that the plainest farmer
in the country can understand it who can read
English, the gentleman very giavely talks about
twenty thousand copies being too many oh, it
will cost so much ' Sir, would he stand ten thou-
sand any better > or five thousand' Does he for-
get how many readers there are' how many-
readers who vote' Why, sir, in New York theie
weie polled, at the last election, three hundred
and seventy thousand votes, and in Pennsylvania
two hundred and fifty thousand Sir, in these
two States alone there aie three hundred thousand
blind men—men who as blindly and implicitly
believe m this Administration as the gentleman
from Maryland does, but the scales from whose
eyes would fall before the bught and piercing
