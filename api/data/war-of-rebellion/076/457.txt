General THOMAS, or if absent,

General STANLEY:

Some prisoners report the enemy engaged in repairing the Augusta road. Send word to General Garrard that I would like to know at once what truth there is in this.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

STANLEY'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 11, 1864-1.25 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Garrard just reports as follows:

Please tell General Sherman that men from Stoneman's command are daily coming in; that they come along the railroad and that on Sunday nothing had been done toward repairing the road. A large part of their cavalry is now in the neighborhood of Covington, and it is generally believed that they will soon make a grand raid to Tennessee or Kentucky. An officer who has just got in staid in that neighborhood three days, as he could not get out of the way of their cavalry. He says he has never seen so much cavalry in one body. Persons from near Atlanta also report the rebel cavalry moving over toward Covington.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 11, 1864.

General STANLEY:

General Schofield will to-morrow move out from our extreme right to reconnoiter in force, and to break the West Point railroad. It is important that the enemy should be well held to his parapet all day. Let your pickets make a dash at theirs about daylight near the old distillery in front of the Howard house, and report to me very early the appearance of things there.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 11, 1864-9.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch to General Thomas received. The 4 1/2-inch gun your ordered to be placed in position on Williams' right was sent there to-day about 3 p.m. General Barry is mistaken as to the gun being sent to the same position the other three are. It never was moved from the camp near the railroad till to-day, when it was sent to Williams' right. General Barry sent for the gun to be placed in position on General Corse's line. I telegraphed him twice relative to it, and informed him the gun was waiting in rear of General Williams' right, where it was originally intended to be placed. He replied that he would send Lieutenant Smith, Fifth United States, for it. Your orders have not been disobeyed, but on the contrary carried into execution as soon as the battery was completed to receive the gun.

J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.
