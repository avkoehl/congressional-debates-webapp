CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, July 17, 1864.

A report obtained from deserters has just been received from headquarters Army of the Potomac, of the same purport as that previously sent you, to wit, that the enemy are preparing to attack us to-night. The enemy have been clearing away the undergrowth in the ravine in our front to enable them to mass their troops. Any guns that can throw shells in the ravine during the night should be employed in this way. Banquettes for the infantry must be put in the parapets that have been fixed for artillery, and pains taken to prepare them, so that the men can shoot freely over the top. the men must be carefully instructed in the manner of delivering their fire, so as to reserve it for the main line in case it is preceded by a line of skirmishers.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
