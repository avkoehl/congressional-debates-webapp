Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy is moving around my left flank, and are now very near the road leading to General Armstrong's headquarters. I have not learned what force is thus flanking me. My skirmishers are being forced back by cavalry, and cannot discover what is in its rear. My position here is now no longer tenable, as I have no protection either on the right or left. I am moving back.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,
