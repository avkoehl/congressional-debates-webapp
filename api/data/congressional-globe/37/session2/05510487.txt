1862.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
I wish to request of the chairman of the Com- ^
mittee of Ways and Means to explain why this '
increase of salary goes back two years.
Mr. STEVENS. At the time this consul was
appointed it was supposed that the salary would
be made $4,000 per annum. There was a bill
pending at the time fixing the salary of the consul
at Swatow at $4,000, but that bill was defeated
after he had left. He was appointed in March,
and left for his post in September, under the im-
pression that his salary was $4,000 a year. The
Senate committee therefore thought that it was
right that this consul should have this salary of
$3,500 from the 21st of Septembei, 18G0. I may
as well say now as at any other time that Swatow
is considered one of the most important ports in
China. Perhaps it is the most important.
Mr. HOLMAN". I would like to inquire fur-
ther, whether $3,500 is an increase upon a former
salary?
Air. STEVENS. This is one of the new ports
opened in China, under our late treaty.
Mr. HOLMAN. Is there no consul there
now?
Mr. STEVENS. There is this consul there
now; but there was none there before him.
Mr. HOLMAN. I do not understand the ob-
ject of making this salary of $3,500 run back to
1860.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is not in order,
there being no proposition before the House.
Mr. IIOLMAN. 1 move to strike out21st of
September, 1860," and in lieu thereof insert " 1st
of January, 1862.'.'
Mr. ST EVENS. This man has been out there
from the 21st of September, I860, as specified in
the bill. He has been acting as consul there under
the Executive. It was deemed important for the
interests of our commerce that he should remain
there. He has remained there in expectation of
receiving his pay. As I have said, this is the most
important port in China.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then these services have
been rendered without authority of law.
Mr. STEVENS. They have been rendered by
the order of the Executive.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then this was done by Mr.
Buchanan without authority of law. It may be
inferred, I think, that this man went out there for
commercial purposes.
Mr. MARSTON. Mr. Chairman, I will make
a brief statement about this case. Mr. Breck was
in business at Singapore, and his appointment to
this consulate at Swatow was sent out to hnn at
that place, but before it reached him he had left
for the United States. The Government, as soon
as he arrived here, desired Mr. Breck immediately
to return. He was regularly appointed the con-
sul at Swatow. The Secretary of State was called
upon by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this
House, to report whether or not a consul was
needed at that port, and he stated in response that
it was the most important port in China, and that
it was important in a judicial as well as in acom-
mercial point of view, that a consulate should be
established there. He recommended that a con-
sulate should be immediately established, and that
the salary should be the same as at other ports in
China, to wit, ยง4,000 per annum.
Mr. HOLMAN. Who is consul there now >
Mr. MARSTON. There has never been but
one consul appointed, and that is William Breck.
Mr. HOLMAN. Is he engaged in any com-
mercial business there?
Mr. MARSTON. He is not. He cannot en-j
gage in commercial business. He is consul there,
and has been for two years. He*was appointed
consul by the Government m 1860, and has ever
since been recognized as such.
The Secretary of State, to return to my state-
ment, urged him to return to China on his arrival
here,assuring him that Congress, no doubt, at its
next session, would provide for his salary. At
the next session a bill did pass, making his salary
$4,000. The bill was referred to the Committee
on Commerce in the Senate,and favorably reported
on by that committee; but that report was not
made until the last day of the session, when unan-
imous consent is required to take up a bill, uud
some member objected. So the bill was lost. Mr.
Breck has been acting without any pay up to the
present time. The Senate think that we ought to !
vote him a salary of $3,500 a year. I think that j-
it is only right and fair to give it to him. I hope, <
therefore, that the Senate amendment will be
agreed to.
The question was taken on Mr. Holman's
amendment, and it was disagreed to.
The question recurred on the amendment of the
Committee of Ways and Means to add:
The consul at Newcastle-upon-Tyne shall receive asalary
of $1,500 per annum, commencing the 1st day of January,
1862.
T
to.
The Senate amendment, as amended, was then
concurred in.
Twentieth amendment:
Strike out the following:
For expenses incurred, under instructions from the Sec-
letaryof State, m bringing home from foreign countries
persons rhaiged with ciime, and expenses incident there-
to, $10,000.
The Committee of Ways and Means recom-
mended a concurrence.
The amendment was concurred in.
Twenty-first amendment:
Rtukcout the following:
To enable the Secietaryof State to have prepared and
tiansmitted to the Executives of the seveial States and Ter-
ritories having boundaries with foreign States a competent
n umber of authentic copies of the settlement of such bound-
aries, and the maps and charts relating thereto, and the evi-
dence thereof in the State Department, $10,000.
The Committee of Ways and Means recom-
mended a concurrence.
The amendment was concurred in.
Twenty-second amendment:
Stiike out "$38,491 98,*' and Insert in lieu thereof
'โข $53,013 98so that the paragraph will read :
For compensation and increased salaries to sundry con-
suls under the act of tile 2d of August, 1861, $53,013 98.
The Committee of Ways and Means recom-
mended a concurrence, with an amendment, as
follows:
Strike out "53,013 98" and in lieu thereof insert
"$54,111 07."
The amendment to the amendment was agreed
to, and the amendment of the Senate as amended
was concurred in.
Mr. CRADLEBAUGH. I move to add the
following:
Provided, That no portion of the appropriation herein
made shall he paid to any official who has not, or does not
take the oath icquircd bv the act of August 6, A. D. 1801,
prior to drawing any poiuon of his salaty.
Mr. HOLMAN. Is not un interpreter an offi-
cial? I think so. He may be in China too. Be-
sides, many of these consuls are not citizens of
the United States.
Mr. STEVENS. T think that we had better
postpone this question for the present.
Mr. CRADLEBAUGH. My amendment sim-
ply provides that the officials named in this act
shall, before drawing any portion of the money
here appropriated, take the oath of allegiance pre-
scribed by the act of August 6, passed at the extra
session. It differs from the oath formerly pre-
scribed for persons acting in an official capacity.
It provides that they shall not only take an oath
to support the Constitution of the United States,
but also that they will defend the United States
Government. It is the oath administered to all
officials now; and I think that our consuls should
particularly be required to take that oath. Look-
ing over the list of" them, it occurs to me that there
are some of them who will not take the oath; and
if they will not, I think they ought not to have
the benefit of the appropriation made by this bill
for them.
The amendment was not agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that the committee
lise, and report the bill and amendments to the
House.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose: and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Mayxard reported that
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had,according to order, had the Union gen-
erally under consideration, and particularly a bill
(II. R. No. 350) making appropriations for the
consular and diplomatic expenses of the Govern-
ment for the year ending 30th of June, 1863, and
additional appropriations for the year ending 30th
June, 1862, and had directed him to report the
same to the House with sundry amendments, with
a recommendation that they do pass.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 move the previous question
upon the amendments.
The previous question was seconded, and'the
main question ordered to-be put.
Mr. STEVENS. I suggest that the question
be taken on agreeing to the amendments in gross,
unless some gentleman desires a separate vote
upon some of them.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
the question will be taken on the amendments in
gross. The Ghair hears no objection. *
The amendments reported from the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union were
agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS moved to reconsider the vote
by which the amendments were agreed to; and
also moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.
Mr. TROWBRIDGE, by unanimous consent,
presented the joint resolutions of the Legislature
of the State oflVlichigan in relation to the exchange
of prisoners, and especially that of Colonel Wil-
cox; which were laid upon the table and ordered
to be printed.
The resolutions were as follows:
" Resolved, That in the present condition of the country,
with no prospect of an immediate termination of the war,
and many of the citizens of tills State in captivity as pris-
oners of war, it is expedient that arrangements should be
made for exchange of prisoners ; and that our Representa-
tives in Congress be requested, and our Senators be in-
structed, to use their proper influence to bring about such
arrangements.
" Resolved, That we hold it to be a duty we owe to our
fellow-countrymen engaged in the present deplorable con-
flict, to do all m our power to mitigate the severities and
barbarism of war, and therefore deem itnot only expedient,
but a dictate ot humanity, that all persons captured as pri-
vateers upon the high seas should be held and deemed to be
prisoners of war, to be held and treated as such during the
continuance of the existing contest.
<e Resolved, Th.it our Senators- in Congress be instructed,
and our Representatives be requested, to urge the adoption
of measures lor the exchange of Colonel Orlando D. Wil-
cox, who was wounded and taken prisoner while in com-
mand of a brigade, and bravely leading the first regiment of
Michigan infantry at the battle of Manassas and who is
now held in close confinement as a hostage in a southern
dungeon."
COLLECTION OF TAXES IN REBEL STATES, ETC.
Mr. OLIN. I wish the attention of the House
for a moment, while I give notice that on Thurs-
day next 1 shall move to take up House bill Wo.
214, with a view to bring the bill before the House
for discussion and action. I wish to call the at-
tention of the House to the nature of that bill. It
was introduced by my colleague upon the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, [Mr. Blair, of Mis-
souri,] the chairman of that committee, and its
objects is to enforce the collection of direct and
other taxes, imposed by the act entitled " An act
to provide for increased revenue from imports; to
pay the interest of the public debt, and for other
purposes," approved August 5, 1861, and to lib-
erate the slaves of rebels and to colonize the same
It is a bill of more importance, in my judgment,
than any one that has been introduced before this
House at this session.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that the
special order set down for that day is the bill re-
ported by the gentleman from Illinois, from the
Judiciary Committee.
Mr. OLIN. Would it interfere with any spe-
cial order if I should call it up on Friday next.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would state that
a number of bills have been postponed to that day,
though none of them have been made special or-
ders.
Mr. OLIN. Is there any special order for
Tuesday -week 3
The SPEAKER. There is none.
Mr. VALLAND1GHAM. I call up the mo-
tion now to reconsider the vote by which the
bill was referred to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union. *
The SPEAKER. On that motion the gentle-
man from New York is entitled to the floor.
Mr. VALLANDICHAM. I raise a question
of order upon the matter. Under the rules of the
House that bill must be first considered in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
When the bill was reported I made exception to
it; but I consented that it should be referredto
the Committee of the Whole. It was deferred
there, and it is not possible tofeke it out of that
committee on a motion to reconsider. It has never
been considered in committee.
