HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 22, 1864

Brigadier-General CRAWFORD,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that an attack of the Second and Sixth Corps has been ordered at 7 p.m. The events of the day may require that we should render assistance to the troops engaged. You will, therefore, hold ready as many of your men as you can spare, or make such disposition in your line as will enable you to spare men to meet the emergency should it arise.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. MARVIN, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Generals Griffin, Ayres, and Cutler.)
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: At 12.10 I found General Wright on the Williams' house road at General Ricketts' first line, and informed him that I had directed Colonel Jones to halt his cavalry at the headquarters of the Sixth Corps, where I left you. General Ricketts' Wheaton is in rear of General Ricketts, ready to act in the required direction, whatever that may be. A few shots were just fired on General Russell's skirmish line. General Wright desires to say that he is advancing his picket line preparatory to a general advance.

Respectfully,

THEODORE LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 22, 1864-1.10 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: General Ricketts' skirmishers have struck the enemy's infantry skirmishers in heavy force. They drove our men a few yards back, but they recovered and now hold without advancing. The country is reported as very thick.

Respectfully,

THEO. LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
