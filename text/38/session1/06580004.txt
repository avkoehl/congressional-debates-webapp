Senate & PIo. of Reps.
for resumption seem ready for action, but remain
inactive, apparently for wantof a rallying point—
a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of
B, rather than B that of A ? And if A and B should
a^ree, how can they know but that, the General
Government here will reject their plan?' By the
proclamation a plan is presented which may be
aecepte'd by them as a rallying point, and which
they are assured in advance will not be rejected
here. This may bring them to act sooner than
they otherwise would.
The objection to a premature presentation of
a plairby the national Executive consists in the
danger of committals on points which could be
more safely left to further developments. Care has
been taken to so shape the document as to avoid
embarrassments from this source. Saying that,
on ceriain terms, certain classes will be pardoned,
with rights restored, itis notsanl that other classes
or other terms will never be included. Saying that
reconstruction will be accepted, if presented in a
specified way, it is not said it will never be ac-
cepted in any other way.
The movements, by State action, for emanci-
pation in several of the States, not included in
the emancipation proclamation, are matters of
profound gratulation. And while I do not re-
peat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly
urged upon this subject, my general views and
feelings remain unchanged; and i trust that Con-
gress will omit no fair oppoituuity of aiding
these important steps to a gieat consummation.
fn the midst of oilier cares, however import-
ant, we must not lose sight of the fact that the
war power is still our main reliance. To that,
power alone can we look, yet for a time, to give
confidence to the people ill the contested regions
that the insurgent power will not again overrun
thenfi. Until that confidence shall lie established,
little can be done anywhere for what is called
reeonslrtielion. TIenee our ehiefest care must
still be directed to the Army and Navy, who have
thus far borne their harder part so nobly and
well. And it may tin esteemed fortunate that 111
giving the greatest efficiency to these indispens-
able arms, we do also honorably recognize the
gallant men, from comrrmndcr to sentinel, who
compose them, and to whom, more than to
others, the world must stand indebted for the
home of freedom ilisinthralled, regenerated, en-
larged, and per^tuated.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
T R U A 3 U It Y D K V A11T  1 K N T,
J)ccember 11), I8(>3.
In submitting to the consideration of Congress
the report en the state of the finances, required
.of him by law at the commencement of each ses-
sion, the Secretary ol the Treasury Ivis much
satislae.tion in being .able to say, in general, that
the opeiations of the Department intrusted to his
charge have been intended, during the last fiscal
year, by a greater measure of success than he
ventured to anticipate at its beginning.
At the beginning of that yenrall deintmtls on the
Ticasuiy had indeed been dischaiged, ami there
remained a balance to the ciedit of the Treasurer
of £1,1,(m,5Hi 81. IJut the huge disbursements,
constantly demanded by military and naval opera-
lions, reduced, by comparison, this seemingly
considerable balance to almost inconsiderable
proportions, ami the practical opeiations of the
restrictive provisions of the acts authouzing the
negotiation of the bonds known as five-twenties,
the most important loan acts not already fully
availed of, made new negotiations for adequate
amounts and 011 admissible terms quite imprac-
ticable. 1 he remorses which befell our arms in
June, July, and August, increased the ditlleul-
ties of the situation, so that, though the Secretaiy
was enabled under existing legislation to provide
luiffely for the met easing disbursements, there re-
mained neeissaniy unpaid, on the firstday of the
last session of Congress, requisitions on the Tieas-
ury, chiefly from the War and Navy Depart-
ments, amounting in the aggregate to the sum ot
$4(134,875 80.
To provide for these requisitions and for cur-
rent-demands, Congress, on the 17th of January,
1863, authorized an additional issue of United
States notes to the amount of §100,000,000; but
did not reach any definite conclusions in regard
to loans in time to embody them in an act before
the day on which the session closed.
On that day, March 3, 1863, the act to provide
ways and means for the support of the Govern-
ment received the approval of the President, and
became law. In addition to various provisions for
loan,s, it contained clauses repealing the restric-
tions affecting the negotiation of the five-twenties,
and thus disengaged that important loan from the
embarrassments which had previously rendered it
almost unavailable.
A week earlier, on the 25th of February, an
net, even more important to the credit of the Gov-
ernment—the act to provide a national currency
through a national banking system—had received
the sanction of Congress and the President. The
salutary effects of these two great acts were soon
conspicuous.
Notwithstanding the aid afforded by the addi-
tional issue of the United States notes, under the
joint resolution of January, the Secretary had
found it impossible to prevents gradual increase,
during the session of Congress, 111 the amount of
unpaid requisitions. Those which were unsatis-
fied at the beginning of the session were indeed
discharged, and large sums weie applied to new
demands for current disbursements. But the ag-
gregate of disbursements remaining necessarily
unpaid, increased steadily, notwithstanding all
efforts to prevent it, until it reached, at the close
of the session, the sum of $72,171,]R9 41.
The loan act and the national banking act were
followed by an immediate revival of public credit.
Success quite beyond anticipation crowned the
efforts of the Secretary to distribute the five-twenty
loan in all parts of the country, as well as every
other measure adopted by bitn for replenishing
the Treasury. The-result was that within two
months after the adjournment of Congress the
whole mass of suspended requisitions had been
satisfied, all current demands promptly met, and
full provision made for the pay of the Army and
Navy. During the remainder of the fiscal year
no embarrassments attended the administration of
the finances except those which are inseparable
from vast expenditures. Notwithstanding these
expenditures, it is gratifying to be able to state
that during the last year the total of disbursements
did not greatly exceed, while the increase of the
publie debt did not equal, the estimates submitted
to Congress by the Secretary at the last session.
Tims, while it was then estimated that the public
debt on the 30th of June, ltS63, would reach the
sum of $1,1^,397,403 24, its actual amount on
that day was §1,098,793,181 37; and while the
disbursements for the year were estimated at
$(;y3,34G,;;21 48, the real total was§714,709,995 58.
The aggregate receipts from all sources, includ-
ing the balance from the preceding year, as shown
by the books of the Treasury, were, during the
last fiscal year, §901,125,674 86, and thcasgn gate
disbuisements 1,895,796.030 65; leavinga'balanee
on the 30th of June, 1SG3, of #5,329,044 21. Hut
sums borrowed during the year, and applied dur-
ing the same time in payment of debts, affect only
nominally the total of receipts and of disburse-
ments. The sums thus borrowed and applied
durini;- the last fiscal year amounted to §181,086,-
635 07. This aggregate, therefore, should be de-
ducted from both sides of the statement, making
the true amount of receipts, including balance
fiom last year, jJ720,039,039 79, and" the true
amount of disbursements §714,709,995 58. The
balance, of course, remains the same.
It is gratifying, also, to be able to state, that
while debts did not reach theamountanticipated,
the receipts fromallsources of income, except in-
ternal revenue, exceeded the estimates. Thus the
receipts from customs, estimated at §68.041,736 59,
were actually §69,059,642 40; from lands, esti-
mated at §88,724 16, were §167,617 17; and from :
miscellaneous sources, estimated at §2,044,316 32, I
were §3,016,615 35. Direct tax receipisweie es- !
t!mated at §11,620,717 99, and this amount, or 1
I" ai !y this amount, has been received in the form !
of payments for military supplies and services by j
the States, for which they are entitled to credit I
beyond theii seveiul proportions of the tax. In I
consequence, however, of incomplete settlements, I
only the sum of §1,485,103 G1 appears on the
books as received into the Treasury.
While the receipts from other ordinary sources
of revenue thus closely correspond with the esti-
mates, or largely exceed them, the receipts from
internal revenue have alone disappointed expec-
tation. The estimate, indeed, was made of the
operation of a law recently enacted, and neces-
sarily imperfectly executed; but such care had
been taken to obtain correct premises that it was
hardly thought possible that the conclusion de-
duced from them could be wide ofthe truth. Under
the instructions of the Commissioner, at the in-
stance of the Secretary, a very competent gentle-
man was for some time employed in ascertaining,
with the aid of practical men, conversant with
business, the probable amount of revenue from
each objectoftaxation. The result of his inquiries
was the estimate which, sanctioned by the Com-
missioner, was believed to be coi rect by the Secre-
tary, and therefore submitted to Congress.
Experience has demonstrated its error. The
estimate was §85,456,303 73, while the actual
receipts were §37,640,787 95. A part ofthe de-
ficiency may be attributed to the imperfect exe-
cution of the law, and a part to the changes made
in it by Congress after the estimate was made;
but it is not probable, hail neither cause operated
to reduce receipts, that the revenue from this
source would have exceeded half the estimated
amount. It is clear that the law, unless materially
amended, will not produce the revenue expected
from it.
The whole ofthe receipts and disbursements for
the last fiscal year may be more easily understood
from a somewhat more formal statement.
The receipts, estimated and actual, then, for
the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June,
18G3, were, including balance from the preceding
year, as follows:

I n his last report the Sect etai y stated that if the
appropriations should equal the estimates, the
balance unexpended at the end of the year would
probably reaeh £200,000,000, and that this sum
should iheiefoie be deducted from the depart-
mental estimates, to make the aggregate corre-
spond with probable conditions. The above
statement shows that the affgresrate of estimates,
thus reduced, was £093,346,321 48, while the
expenditures were$734,709,905 58,oxceedingthe

there must he deducted the actual i eceipts, $124,-

to the amount of the debt on the 1st of July,
