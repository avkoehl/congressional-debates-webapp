P. S.-I may here say that the numbers reported as wounded, namely, 43,included those whose wounds prevented them from moving on with the army. In this supplemental report I have included all those who were slightly wounded either by ball or accidents, but whose injuries did not prevent their continuance with their commands and in line of duty.

No. 9. Report of Brigadier General John S. Williams, C. S. Army, commanding Second Brigade.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, September 18, 1862.

CAPTAIN: On the morning of the 10th instant, agreeably to Major-General Loring's order, I detached the Twenty-second Virginia Regiment (Colonel Patton), and directed him to report the turnpike and took a mountain path to the left, about 6 miles from Fayette Court-House, for the purpose of attacking the enemy in the rear. It was agreed between him and myself that the march of my brigade should be retarded one hour, so that he might turn the enemy's position and the attack be made
