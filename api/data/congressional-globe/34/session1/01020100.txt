THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 20;
Mr. COBB, of Alabama, said: I do not rise ior
the ourpose of detaining the House with a speech.
I do not intend, upon this occasion, to give ex-
pression to the sentiments which I entertain in
reference to the Kansas-Nebraska bill, but simply
to correct a misrepresentation which has been
made in reference to what occurred in this Hall on
the 11th day of this month. I find, in a paper
which is published and circulated in dis-
trict, a communication from some letter-writer—
I know not who he is, though I know that both
he and other letter-writers are my enemies, and
endeavor to stab me in the dark, and to injure
my reputation both at home and all over the coun-
try—m which he misrepresents my position in
reference td a motion to adjourn which was made
on this floor, on the 11th instant, by Mr. Stanton,
of Ohio. That gentleman then stated his object
to be, that they, the Banks men,—for lie is a
Banks man,—might have an opportunity for con-
sultation. It is stated in the communication to
which 1 have referred, that I seconded the motion
of the gentleman from. Ohio to adjourn, after it
had been stated by him, that his object was to
enable his party to hold a consultation, in order
to promote Mr. Banks's election. I say, most
emphatically, that this statement is false. I did
not second the motion, for I understood well the
construction which would have been put upon
such action, and that construction would have
been circulated in my district, in order to oblige
mo to meet it there. I prefer to meet it here,
with two hundred and thirty witnesses around
me. I pronounce the statement false,and every
man of this House will bear me witness that it is
false.
I have thought it best to say thus much, since
I remember, on another occasion in the past, to
have lot a misrepresentation go uncorrected, be-
cause 1 deemed it unimportant, and the assertion,
though false, was brought up against me in the
canvass of my district, and caused me much more
trouble than a correction of it upon this floor, at
the time, would have done. Therefore 1 make
the correction here, and pronounce the statement
a. lie.
Mr. EDWARDS also stated that, on account
of the sickness of Mr. IIaven, he had paired off
with I luit gentleman on the vote for Speaker, but,
-were he ut libeity to vote, he should vote for Mr.
J>a>:ics.
The House then proceeded to vote the seventy-
foui th time for Speaker, with th<v following result:
