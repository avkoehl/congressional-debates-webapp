ifluence which mar one day piove fatal to the
federal part of our system If we do not separate
the influence of the Executive from the interest of
banking incorporations, we shall have another
controversy on the subject of bank-. The political
will be united with the money powei , the contest
must come, it will come You will witness a
struggle in this, Capitol between State banks and
federal banks, and the combatants for the Presi-
dent's chair will be found contending in different
ranks of mteiest and influence, whi'st they mar
the peace of the country, and shake the pillars of
the constitution Separate them, I beseech you,
representatives of the Ameucan people, if you
wish to put down this fearful contest foi the Pre
sidential chair—I had almost said Presidential
throne Sepaiatc, I entreat you, banking and poll
tjcs Let the banks facilitate the exchanges of
« ommeice, and fimhei the mteiest of trade, but
let them, I pray you, have rothmg to Jo with the
C ■• 'ernment"
The piedictions oí my inend have been fulfilled
to ihe letter What have we seen J You biought
into existence a sjstern of State banks, connected
fium one end ol tins confederacy to the other, re-
ceiving, disbursing, and acting upon those depo-
sites, organized and controlled by, and responsible
to, one man, and then brought into overwhelming
conflict, as I believe, with the fi eedom of elec tions
Sir, I speak plainly i believed then, and I now
believe, that this was the Hue source of powei for
the last tin et yeais Gentlemen maj speak as they
please They may deni, and say they have nevci
seen or felt it, but who is it that knows anything of
the operations of banks, who is it at all acquainted
with their p^culiai influence, who isnotinesistibly
impiessed with their tremendous power1 Sir, I
believe they did more than any thing thing else to
elect thepiesentPiesidentofthe United States, and
am 1 now to be called upon and urged to re orgaw7e
such a system, and abandon the position I then as-
sumed ' The expenenci ol the hst thioe vears
sliengtheris mv position It in iv be dmed, bull
conscientiously believe, that these institutions have
controlled, more 01 less, not onl} the destinies of this
Government, but the destinies of the people of this
tountiy dunng that petíod Yes, we all know that
at the la-t session of Congress enough was devel
oped upon this floor to demonstrate that th< re was
an organized system, acting through one man, giv
mgeneigy to the whole, and for one and the same
puipose Yes, sn, we have seen this coulon of
leagued banks, with their various interests, raising
their banner, fi om one end oí this Union to the
other, up in which was inscribed, the infamous
motto," 1 o the vutois belong the s] oils," >nd call-
ing upon tlu it mercenatv binds log itliei in to the
pluiida ot siched cities and sub|iu,ited piovinces
.A .ran, Mi   Cln-n man, am I now   ai this tune, to
change mj comsr because othcis have come tome''
No, sn       1 mamtim the veiv giomuls I then mam
tamed, and I evci «ill miintamthem, till mvjudg
meat and my ronvirtion tell i ic they are w ong
I cannot but believe that the signal failuie of
these institutions as fiscal agents foi  this Govern-
ment—I cannoi but believe too   sir, that the expe-
nent e of the last three v ears, must have eonv meed
eveiy one of hen mefheacy, and the inexpediency
and folly ol their being selected again  as the de-
posito! íes ol the Government, except w ith oac view
And this is the  reason whv some gentlemen now
aequie ce in their ic oigamzation, that is, that thev
well know that this operation  and their ic orgam
/ihon  will bring us a°"im into a s'ate of amichy
and c mlusion, and ioire the countiy into the ^op-
tion of a hank of the United S'a cs     They know
well, sir, that it tends to Ilia, and thev know tin.,
if these Stale banks are again selected as uublic de
posiloucs, thev will be but the stepping stone to the
estable un-"it oí   a  bank ot   llw   United  Sates
This, sn, is the iea!, the true issue    It is an is-ite
between  makm-,  the fiscal   agents of the Govern
ment sepárale and independent horn all banks, mil
the establishment of a banl  of ihe United States
which nievm'^v   in ist be  adopted cventnally and
that not ata vei\   re note  period  if you ic adopt
now the State hank s< s'em as the fisc il agencj of
the Government
Astolhe consti'utional irgumti t Mi Obanman,
in refeience to the establishmcntof a national bank,
I will not ttespass unon the atteition of the house
to discuss u at length at this late period of the
session Í too well know, sir, Jiat a lefeience to
the stuct letlei of the fedeial consulution, is too
apt to excite the laughter ami mirth of a majoi il\
on this floor, and the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia, (Mr Biddle,) the other day, with truth, allud-
ed to an observation of a late distinguished citizen
from Virginia, (John Randolph,) that" the time was
not far off when,a man would be called to older on
the floor of Congress, forspeakingof the constitution
of the United States." I am not, therefore, dis-
posed to press that argument, but still I take occa-
sion here to say, that the framers of the constitu-
tion never intended to confer such a power Wnat
changes might have taken p^ce, could they have
foreseen what has since taken place, is a question
not for me to decide I lay down this position,
from the history of the federal convention, that
the framers of that instrument never intended to
confer this power And why"! Because the pro-
posal was distinctly made, first to create corpoia-
tions generally, and then to incorporate where
Hie general good requi-i ed These propositions were
referred to a committee, and that committee never
reported Afterwards, a proposition was made to
confer the power to make canals, and a motion to
amend it by conferring the power to cieate corpo-
rations, was made, and it was expressly rejected
One argument used in debate, was, that if this
power were conferred, the Government would m-
corpoiate a bank, and that, therefore, the large
cities would then be opposed to the adoption of the
constitution As tar, then, as history is concerned,
it is clear the frameia of the constitution never in-
tended to confer that power
I know, sir, there is an argument upon this point
which appears very specious It is this, that, in
looking into that instrument, vvfi cannot look de-hor
the preamble and the specific provisions, for its
sound construction, but are bound to confine our-
selves to the instrument itself Sir, if this were a
court of justice, I would yield to the general sound-
ness of that rule, but we are a political tribunal,
not sitting in judgment upon the law aheady made
but to make the law itself according to the instru-
ment under which we hold authontv I know
that, m i ¡udieial tribunal, in a case arising be-
tween memn and imim, where vested lights are con-
cerned, a judge can only look to the preamble and
the act, he cannot look beyond the law itself This is
a sounel and wise i ule as applied to ajudicial tribunal,
but will not hold m its application to a political tribu-
nal, wheie we are bound to look at the circumstan-
ces under which the constitution was formed, and
we are to decide on the powers contained in that
instrument by the circumstances under which it
was itself adopted Here we have no case arising
under the law—no vested interests That which
is a wise rule when applied to a judicial tribuna
has no anphc Uion to a political tribunal The cr
ation ol a eorpoiation is the exeicise of a substan
tive independent power, and to attach it by con-
struction as a vagrant power to this 01 to that t lause
in the constitution is establishing a loose generality
of i easomng which must end m the total overthrow
of that noble instrument I am not unaware of the
arguments that, in fact, the constitution of the Uni-
ted States intended to c infer the power in this Gov-
ernment over the cunency of the country, and that
the State banks have been created since the forma-
tion of that instrument, w hich have substantially
ere lied anew currency, and thereby usuipedthat
pow ei fi om the General Government It is a ques-
tit> lexaít r whethei the Sta'es have not committed
a fiaud upon that clause in the constitution which
forbids them "to emit bills of credit directly or m-
dircctlv " They have ciea'ed local institutions
which, to a trieat ex'ent, have set afloat a new cur-
lencv that the framers of the constitution nevei
co templated, and now it is contended that it is con-
stitutional to counteract and eontiol this currency
by the ci eatton of a corporation undei the stv le and
title of a bank of the United Stat s    Now this ar-
tunent pi oves too much, if it prot es any thing, be-
c ause it is clear that if this ev il has arisen since the
foimation of the constitution, the framers of that
msmtment nevei could have intended to counter-
act it The evil is admitted to be a new one,
and has arisen smce the formation of that instru-
ment, and they nevei could have intended to con-
fer a power to counteract that which they never un-
derstood or kr ew would exist
^ir, I say the argument proves too much—but I
am not disposed to press this matter I w ill only
sav that as fai as experience goes (and it n av
s em strange to some gentlemen but I am disposed
to lay down and maintain the proposition strange as
it may appear to some,) that the bank of 1816 never
did restore the cunency of the countrv, and could
not, that it was not the bank which restored the de-
ranged currency at that time, but it was the power
and credit of this Government, under the constitu-
tion, by enforcing the collection of its dues m specie
If this power had been simply enforced, it would
have compelled an unsound currency to be with-
drawn, or to lall to an ascertained value The
United States Bank was the agent to carry on the
fiscal operations of the Government, and what gave
it its power was the credit given to it by tins Gov-
ernment, declaring that its bills snould be received
as gold and silver It was the credit of this Gov-
ernment endorsed upon its bills, without reference
to their convertibility at all, but simply and abso-
lutely receiving them as gold and silver The
Government being the great and universal money
dealer, had practically surrendered up its power to
com money, and to receive nothing else into the
hands of a corporation, and made its notes the same
as coined money, so far as the Government de-
mands were concerned. But, even then, m 1817,
'18, and '19, that bank was brought to the brink ot
insolvency, and all the other banks were made to feel
its power, while many fell prostrate before it. And
what alone sustained that bank then"* The power
of this Government declaring that its bills should
be received in payment of its dues as gold and sil-
ver While other banks had to sustain themselves
upon their capacity to convert their bills into coined
money, this bank sustained itself by the Govern-
ment converting its credit to the use and benefit
of the bank, and that credit serving as a specie
basis The great confusion that has occurred on
this subject arises from the fact, that many have
confounded the power and credit of the Govern-
ment with that of the bank.
The power to "com money and regulate the value
thereof," and the prohibition of this power to the
States, and also the prohibition that prevents any
thing butgold and silver being made a legal tender,
is all the power conferred by the constitution over the
currency Whether it be defective or not, it is all
thepowei given But if it be rigidly adheied to
without temporising, it must, oí necessity, cieate a
general standard by which the local or paper cur-
rency can be compaied. It is immaterial what a
bank bill purports to be upon its face, if it have an
ascertained value, by comparison with specie, it is
all that can be required And the Government,
collecting its dues m this standard, and habitually
disbursing in its equivalent, would create centres
at different points, around which the local currency
would revolve and receive a fixed and known
value
Sir, to all intents and purposes, this would be a
measute of currency I am aware that it is not as
exact a measure as weights and measures are ap-
plied to other things, but it is the best ever invented
by man, and comes nearei to it than any other
standaid jet cieafed by Government, or which,
I believe, can be created As to exchanges, this is
not a subject within the legitimate object of this
Government, except as it may be incidentally ef-
fected They must be left, as they are m other
countries, to be regulated by the interests of the
commercial communitj, and conducted by banks
or bankers, who have acquired credit by long
economy and prudence, based upon real capital
and resting upon the productions of different sec-
tions Sir, the difficulty m 1814 and 1815 was, that
the Government became embarrassed and involved.
Individuáis could not advance to it—the local
banks did adv anee, and, upon the faith of the debts,
m the shape of stocks they held against Govern-
ment, these banks went on discounting as if they
had that amount in specie instead of Government
stock and what was the result t Why, when those
debts became due, the Government itself was una-
ble to make payments, and the inevitable conse-
quence was, that these local bank notes fell below
pai, as they could not be converted, and the Gov-
ernment then, in turn, sustained those institutions
it had borrowed from And, although it nevei
was, I helieve, sanctioned by law, yet the Govern-
ment received their notes in public dues on a par
with gold and silvei This produced a demand
for depreciated paper, and that which was most de-
preciated w as sought aftei to pay into the custom-
houses, as it could be purchased with the hast
eomed'money The result of this was, that the
Government would have had, finally, all the de-
preciated paper of the country forced upon its col-
lectors It w as the policy the Government adopted
of receivmgad vanees from the local banks, and then
pursuing the temporising expediency of receiving
