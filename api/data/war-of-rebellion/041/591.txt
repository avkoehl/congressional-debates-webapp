Colonel CAHILL:

I sent the steamer to Brashear City three days ago, directing them to hold out.

I now get a telegram from General Banks, telling me not to risk too much to save Brashear City. You will, therefore, hold your reserves on this side of the La Fourche, and send forward such relief to Brashear as will not risk your command.

Colonel CAHILL:

I am satisfied from dispatches from Donaldsonville that there is no enemy back of you, and that they are all between you and Brashear, and in no more force than you estimate. Therefore, push the repair of the road, and get your advance on the enemy's rear as rapidly as possible.

General Banks' dispatch to me, the substance of which I forwarded to you, is too late, and was written before he knew of our success.

The only chance of relieving Brashear is by attacking the enemy in the rear.

I will order one train in with this dispatch, as I do not know whether the news has got to you by the wires or not. I shall retain one train here to await orders. Shall I make my way to the river and fall back, or remain here? Shall I burn the Des Allemands Bridge, and bring all the troops to the city? I await your orders by the train that takes this in.
