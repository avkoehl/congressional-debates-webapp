THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

hands The limited power of the Secretary of the
Treasury over the subject, disabled him from
making the investigation as fully and satisfactorily
as it could be done by a committee of the House of
Representatives, and hence the President desired
the assistance of Congress to obtain for the Treas-
ury Department a full knowledge of all the facts
which were necessary to guide his judgment. But
it was not his purpose, as the language of his mes-
sage will show, to ask the representatives of the
people to assume a responsibility which did not
belong to them, and relieve the executive branch
of the Government from tne duty which the law
had imposed upon it. It is due to the President
that his object in that proceeding should be dis-
tinctly undei stood, and that he should acquit him-
self of all suspicion of seeking to escape from the
performance of his own duties, or of desiring to
interpose another body between himself and the
people in order to avoid a measure which he is
called upon to meet. But although, as an act of
justice to himself, he disclaims any design of so
licitmg the opinion of the House of Representa-
tives in relation to his own duties, m order to shel-
ter himself from responsibility under the sanction
of their counsel, yet he is at all times ready to lis-
ten to the suggestions of the representatives of the
people, whether given voluntarily or upon solicita-
tion, and to consider them with the profound re-
spect to which all will admit that they are justly
entitled. Whatever may be the consequences,
however, to himself, he must finally form his
own judgment where the Constitution and the law
makes it his duty to decide, and must act accord-
ingly, and he is bound to suppose that such a
course on his part will never be regarded by that
elevated body as a mark of disrespect to itself- but
that they will, on the contrary, esteem it the
strongest evidence he can give of his fixed resolu-
tion conscientiously to discharge his duty to them
and the country.                                                    (
A new state of things has, however, arisen since
the close of the last session of Congress, and evi-
dence has since been laid befoie tne President
which he is persuaded would have led the House
of Representatives to a different conclusion if it had
come to their knowledge. The fact that the bank
controls, and in some cases substantially owns, and
by its money suppoits some of the leading presses
of the countiy, is now more clearly established
Editors to whom it loaned extiavagant sums in
1831 and 1832, on unusual time-and nominal se-
curity, have since turned out to be insolvent, and
to others appaiently in no better condition, accom-
modations still moie extravagant, on terms moie
unusual, and some without any security, have
also been heedlessly gra.ited
The allegation which has so often circulated
through these channels, that the Treasury was
banki upt and the bank was sustaining it, when fm
many years there has not been less, on an avenge,
than six milliors of public money in that institu-
tion, might be passed ovei as a harmless misrepre-
sentation, but when it is attempted, by substantial
acts, to impair the credit of the Government and
tainish the honoi of the country, such charges re-
quire more serious attention. With six millions
of public money in its vaults, after having had the
use of from five to twelve millions for nine years,
without lnteiett, it became the purchaser of a bill
drawn bv our Government on that of Tiance for
about ¿900,000, being the first instalment of the
French indemnity The puichase money was left
in the use of the bank, being simply added to the
Treasuiy deposite The bank sold the bill in Eng-
land, and the holder sent it to France for collection,
and arrangements not having been made by the
Fiench Government foi its payment, it was taken
up by the agents of the bank in Paris with the
funds of the bank in their hands Under these
cncumstances, it has, thiough its oigans, openly
assailed the credit of the Government, and has ac-
tually made, and persists in a demand, of fifteen
per cent , or $158,842 77, as damages, when no
damage, or none beyond some trifling expense,
has, in fact, been sustained, and when the bank had
m Us own possession on deposite several millions
of the public money winch it was then using for
its own profit Is a fiscal agent of the Govern-
ment which thus seeks to enrich itself at the ex-
pense oí the public woithy of further tiust?
There aie other important tacts not in the con-
templation of the House of Representatives, or
not known to the members at the time they voted
for the resolution.
Although the charter and the rules of the bank
both declare that " not less than seven directors"
shall be necessary to the transaction of business,
yet the most important business, even that of
granting discounts to any extent, is intrusted to a
committee of five members, who do not report to
the board.
To cut off all means of communication with the
Government in relation to its most important acts
at the commencement of the present year, not one
of the Government directors was placed on any
one committee. And although since, by an un-
usual remodelling of those bodies, some of those
directois have been placed on some of the com-
mittees, they are yet entirely excluded from the
committee of exchange, through which the
greatest and most objectionable loans have been
made.
When the Government directors made an effort
to bring back the business of the bank to the board,
in obedience to the charter and the existing regu-
lations, the board not only overruled their attempt,
but altered the rule so as to make it conform to
the practice, in direct violation of one of the most
important provisions of the charter which gave
them existence.
It has long been known that the president of the
bank, by his single will, ougmates and executes
many of the most important measures connected
with the management and credit of the bank, and
that the committee, as well as the board of direct-
ors, aie left m en tne ignorance of many acts done,
and correspondence carried on in their names, and
apparently under their authority The fact has
been recently disclosed, that an unlimited discre-
tion has been, and is now, vested in the president
of the bank to expend its funds in payment for
prepaimg and circulating articles, and purchasing
pamphlets and newspapers, calculated by their
contents to operate on elections, and secure a re-
newal of its charter It appears, from the official
report of the public directors, that on the 30 h
November, 1830, the president submitted to the
board an aiticle published in the American Quar-
terly Review, containing favoiable notices of the
bank, and suggested the expediency of giving it a
wider circulation at the expense of the bank;
whereupon the board passed the following resolu-
lution, viz:
" Resohed, That the president be authorized to
take such measures in regard to the circulation of
the contents of the said article, either m whole or
in part, as he may deem most for the interest of
the bank "
By an entry in the minutes of the bank, dated
March 11th, 1831, it appeals that the president
had not only caused a large edition of that article
to be issued, but had also, before the resolution
of 30th November was adopted, procured to be
printed and widely circulated numerous copies of
the reports of General Smith and Mr McDufi-ie
m favor of the bank, and on that day he sug-
gested the expediency of extending his power to
the printing of other articles which might subserve
the purposes of the institution Whereupon the
following lesolution was adopted, viz
" Resohed, That the president is hereby author-
ized to cause to be prepared and circulated such
documents and papers as may communicate to the
people information in regard to the nature and
operations of the bank "
The expenditures purporting to have been made
urder authority of these resolutions during the
years 1831 and 1832, were about $.80,000 For a
poition of these expendituies voucheis v eie ren-
dered, ftom which it appeals that they were in-
curred in the purchase of some hundied thousand
copies of newspapeis, leports, and speeches made
in Congress, reviews of the veto message, and
reviews of speeches against the bank,&c,&"
For another large portion no \oucheis whatever
weie*rendered, but the various sums were paid
on ordeis of the president of the bank, maku g
lefeience to the resolution of the 11th of March,
1831
On ascertaining these facts, and perceiving that
expenditures of a similar character were still con-
tinued, the Government directors, a few weeks
ago, offeied a lesolution in the boaid, calling foi a
specific account of these expenditures, showing
the objects to which they had been applied, and
the persons to whom the money had been paid.
This reasonable proposition was voted down.
They also offered a resolution rescinding the
resolutions of November, 1830, and March, 1831.
This also was rejected.
Not content with thus refusing to recall the ob-
noxious power, or even to require such an account
of the expenditure as would show whether the
money of the bank had in fact been applied to
the objects contemplated by these resolutions, as
obnoxious as they were, the boaid renewed the
power already conferred, and even enjoined re-
newed attention to its exercise by adoping the
following, jn lieu of the propositions submitted
by the Government directors, viz:
"Resolved, Tnat the board nave confidence in the
wisdom and integrity of the president, and in the
propriety of the resolutions of 30th November,
1830, and 11th March, 1831, and entertain a full
conviction of the necessity of a renewed attention
to the object of those resolutions, and that the
president be authorized and requested to continue
his exertions for the promotion of said object "
Taken in connexion with the nature of the ex-
pendituies heretofore made, as recently disclosed,
which the board not only tolerate, but approve,
this resolution puts the funds of the bank at the
disposition of the president, for the purpose of
employ.ng the whole press of the country in the
service of the bank, to hire writers and newspapers,
and to pay out such sums as he pleases, to what
person and for what services he pleases, without
the responsibility of i endering any specific account.
The bank is thus converted into a vast electioneer-
ing engine, with means to embroil the country
m deadly feuds, and, under cover of expenditures,
in  themselves improper, extend its  corruption
I through all the ramifications of society.
I     Some of the items for which accounts  have
been rendeied show the construction which has
i been given to the reso'utions, and  the way in
which the power it confers has been exerted. The
money has not been expended merely in the pub-
lication and distribution of speeches, reports of
committees, or articles written for the purpose of
showing the constitutionality or usefulness of the
' bank.    But publications have been prepared and
extensively circulated containing the grossest in-
vectives against the officers of the Government;
and the money which belongs to the stockholders
and to the public has been freely applied in ef-
forts to degrade, in public estimation, those who
were supposed to be instrumental in resisting the
I wishes of this grasping and dangerous institution.
As the president of the bank has not been re-
| quired to settle his accounts, no one but himself
knows how much more than the sum already men-
I tioned may have been squandered, and for which
I a credit may hereafter be claimed in his account
¡ under this most extraordinary resolution    With
these facts before us can we be surprised at the
torrent of abuse incessantly poured out against all
| who are supposed to stand in the way of the cu-
pidity or ambition of th e Bank of the United States >
Can we be sui priced at sudden and unexpected
changes  of opinion  in  fa\or  of an  institution
which has millions to lavish, and avows its determ-
| ination  not to spare its  means when   they are
necessaiy to accomplish its purposes'    The re-
fusal to render an account of the manner in which
a part of the money expended has been applied,
1 gives just cause for the suspicion that it has been
used foi purposes which it is not deemed prudent
to expose to the eyes of an intelligent and virtuous
people.   Those who act justly do not shun the
light, nor do they refuse explanations when the
I piopuety of then conduct is brought into ques-
tion
With these facts before him in an official re-
port from the Government directors, the Pies-
ldent would feel that he was not only responsible
for all the abuses and corruptions the bank has
committed, oi may commit, but almost an accom-
plice in a conspuacy agambt that Government
which he has sworn honestly to administer, if he
I did not take every step within his constitutional
and legal power like'y to be efficient in putting an
end to these enormities If it be possible, within
the scope of human affairs, to find a reason for
I  i emoting the Government deposites, and leaving
