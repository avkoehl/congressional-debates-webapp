In the Field, August 10, 1864 - 7.40 p. m.

Colonel SHARPE,

Deputy Provost-Marshal-General, City Point:

I have received but one deserter thus for to-day. He was from Terry's brigade, of Pickett's division. Pickett's division, with Thomas' and Scales' brigades, remains as heretofore. This man knew nothing about Kershaw's division, whether they were in his rear or not. Richmond papers of to-day announce the capture by our forces and occupancy of Fort Gaines, Mobile Harbor. Another of the forts was blown up by the rebels to prevent its falling into our hands. Nothing to-day from north side of the James.
