ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF WISCONSIN,

Madison, Wis.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to additional credits for troops furnished by the State of Wisconsin. In reply I am directed to inform you that the State has this day been credited with the following additional:

Prior to June 30........................................1,016

Subsequent to June 30 and to include September 21....... 397

_______

Total, three-years" standard......................... 1,413

In the number 1,016 we have credited you with 87 men for the Eleventh Battery, as per your statement, yet we have no muster-in or muster and pay rolls filed of it. Will you therefore furnish a history of the organization and give station where now serving so that our records may be perfected? The Milwaukee cavalry and Gibbong's band are included in the number 1,016. The State claims 2,545 recruits since January 1, 1862. Are-examination of our rolls indicates but 2,507, a difference of 38. This number has been credited, and I have requested the chief mustering officer to examine his records
