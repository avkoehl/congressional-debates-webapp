PILOT TOWN LANDING, Thursday, August 18, 1864.

Major MARSTON:

General Granger wishes to have a signal station close to the beach near Colonel Grier's headquarters to communicate with him at Pilot Town. Captain Walker's station is too far back for that, I think. Sergeant Nicholas would do.

DENICKE,

Lieutenant.

Lieutenant DENICKE:

Put him there.

MARSTON,

Major.

Captain WALKER:

You will put Sergeant Nicholas on the beach to communicate with this boat when at Pilot Town Landing. Your station cannot be seen from there. He can carry any messages he receives to you to forward.

By order of Major Marston:

[DENICKE.?]

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I have 100 tons of soft to spare. Do you want it?

GRANGER,

General.

General GRANGER:

Where is the coal?

FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

On board the transport Alabama, at Fort Gaines.

GRANGER,

General.

ON BOARD FLAG-SHIP.

CAPTAIN OF TRANSPORT ALABAMA,

Fort Gaines Landing:

Go at once to monitor Winnebago at Pilot Town and discharge as much coal as she wants. Deliver the balance to the ram Tennessee.

GRANGER,

General.

Captain PERKINS,

Assistant Quartermaster at Fort Gaines:

Captain Walker, signal officer, reports that there are at Fort Gaines several stages for use of the Signal Corps. As the position of the signal party is not sufficiently elevated at present, will you not have one of the stages brought here for their use?

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Mobile Point.

Lieutenant HALLETT,

Fort Gaines:

Send a signal tower on board the barge immediately.

GRANGER,

General.

General GRANGER:

It is at lower landing. Will send for it at once.

HALLETT,

Lieutenant.

Lieutenant HALLETT:

Send it to Pilot Town by first boat.

GRANGER,

General.
