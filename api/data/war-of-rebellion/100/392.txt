RALEIGH, N. C., May 4, 1865-10. 50 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Morehead City:

I have just learned from Wilmington that you have passed Fort Fisher toward Morehead. The paroling of Johnston's army and delivery of arms have been completed and his troopos started south yesterday. The most of the North Carolina troops went home without waiting for their paroles. General Johnston thinks about 800 cavalry went south, refusing to accept the terms. He thinks they want to go to Mexico. My paroling officers think the number paroled will amount to 30,000. I will make full reports as soon as practicable. The paroled men from both Johnston's and Lee's armies are plundering to some extent, otherwise all is quiet. I am in telegraphic communication with Richmond and Washington. No important news from the North. All well.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
