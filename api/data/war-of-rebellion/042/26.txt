MAY 31, 1863.

FORT MORGAN.

This work is in good condition. Nothing has been done on it during the month.

FORT GAINES.

Laborers and carts have been engaged in embarking glacis coupee on the north and west fronts and sodding the same. This has now been completed, and the fort is wholly defensible, excepting that its armament is not complete. The tower bastions remain without the gun intended for each, and seventeen flank casemate howitzers are yet lacking.

OBSTRUCTIONS BETWEEN FORTS MORGAN AND GAINES.

Four rows of heavy piles extending from the west bank, nearly 2 miles toward Fort Gaines, have been planted. Nothing more is proposed here.

BATTERY AT GRANT'S PASS.

A wharf has been completed at this place in the last month. The battery is in good condition.
