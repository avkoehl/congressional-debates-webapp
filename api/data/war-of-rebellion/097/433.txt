HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-9.45 a.m.

Major-General ORD,Commanding Army of the James:

GENERAL: I have received your dispatch and have communicated contents to Brigadier-General Hays, commanding Second Division, repeating my directions to him to have the most careful examinations made again from every point of view practicable to reach. It has been reported to me that the work is surrounded with wide slashing. I infer from your dispatch that on the face toward General Turner it is not so. The work can receive re-enforcements from two directions, from the north side of Hatcher's Run, and from the intrenched line on the south side of Hathcer's Run, which connects the Crow house work with the works at Burgess' Mill. Both these approaches I understand from your dispatch your sharpshooters and artillery control.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS, April 1, 1865-7 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch of 9.45 a.m. just received this 7 p.m. From all that I can learn and from observation we do command the approaches to the fort so as to keep any large body of men from marching in there. A few might by stooping get in under cover. I think you will have to open a pretty sharp artillery fire to break their abatis and lashings so as to open a way for your assault.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH CORPS, April 1, 1865.

Major-General TURNER,Commanding Independent Division, Twenty-fourth Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires that you express to Colonel Potter his satisfaction for the gallantry displayed by himself and troops this morning.

Respectfully, yours,

J. H. POTTER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH CORPS, April 1, 1865.

Brevet Major-General TURNER,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Immediately after dark to-night Osborn's brigade, First Division, will be sent to relieve the right of your line. You can then withdraw one of your brigades, or more, according to the number of men Osborn has, and put them in reserve to rest. Do not, however,
