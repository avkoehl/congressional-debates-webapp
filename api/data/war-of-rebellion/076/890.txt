General J. E. JOHNSTON, C. S. Army:

GENERAL: Your order turning over the command of this army to General Hood has been read to the troops of this brigade.

I have the fullest assurance that I express the undivided sentiment of this brigade when I say that the abiding and unlimited confidence which we have left in the wisdom of your judgment and leadership, has sustained us in the many trying hours of our very arduous campaign. We have ever left that the best was being done that could be, and have looked confidently forward to the day of triumph, when with you as our leader we should surely march to a glorious victory. This confidence and implicit trust
