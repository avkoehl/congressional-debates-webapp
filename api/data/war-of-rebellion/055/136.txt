Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLONEL: David Gardiner, first lieutenant Company B, Thirty-seventh Tennessee Infantry, Tyler's brigade, Bate's division, Breckinridge's corps, who resides near Knoxville, Tennessee, came in last night, making the following statement:

Buckner's and Anderson's divisions moved day before yesterday to McLemore's and Pigeon Coves. Indications are that a general move is to be made. Baggage is being reduced, and hard bread is being issued. Most of the army is massed between Bragg's headquarters and Lookout Mountain; but few troops on the right of Bragg's headquarters. Reported yesterday that Longstreet occupied Knoxville. Bragg's army now here is composed of four corps, two divisions in each corps, four brigades in each division. The corps are commanded by Hardee, Breckinridge, Walker, and Buckner. Total strength about 60,000.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

The movement to McLemore's Cove was made to meet Sherman, who was expected to attack Stevens' Gap.

[Sent to Generals Thomas and Grant.]
