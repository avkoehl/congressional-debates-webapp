Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Smith.
Ho. qw Reps.
tend far beyond it, she claims not in her recent
measures to be sustained by this Government
beyond the terms of it. But she does claim to be
protected in acting up to the terms of it. She
has acted up to the teimsof it—her present posi-
tion marches up only to the teuns of it, and
while not seeking to go beyond, she Will not, she
cannot, without infamy upon her name, fall back
fiom her position thus taken, or retract one step
m support of it which she has thus made. It is
un)ust to ask her to do so, it would be dishonor-
able to her, after what has transpued, to submit
to any such request, fiom whatever quarter em-
anating.
And yet, sir, what is the proposition of the
Executive> What is the airangement attempted
to be made for her in the protocol of the national
Executive with the present British Ministei '
Head it I ask the committee to pause upon it. I
confess I can íegard it only as a palpable depar-
ture fiom the terms heretofore agieed on between
the two Governments, as I have already shown
them to have been, and a suirender of the lights
of Mame to the new and unwai ran table encroach-
ments of the British Government. It provides as
follows.:
" Her Majesty's officer wilt not seek to expel, by military
force, the armed parly which lias been sent by Mame into
the districr boidering on the Atoostook nvrr , but tbe gov-
ernment or Mime «ill voluntarily, without needless delay,
withdi aw ■beyond the bounds of the disputed territory any
¡urned fotce «low within tlum, and, it future necessity
should arise lor di-persing notorious trespassers,or protect
nig public pioperty trom depredation by an armed foice"—
What shall be done, sir' Shall Maine, in that
case, as she has done now, wield her ¡uusdiction
untiammeled, and according to her own sense of
light oi expediency, ever the Aroostook coun-
tiy' No, sir, /at ¡from, tí The Piesident's new
arrangement for Mame is that, under a recui lence
of depredation* like those which Maine has un-
let taken to stop and punish,
" The operation shall be conducted by concert, jointly
or separatelv, according to agreements between the gov
'rnmeuts of ¡Maine and New Btunswrck "
Yes, su; whether the operation be conducted
Jointly or separately, it must be—it shall be only
—conducted as the result of concert between the
two governments of Maine and New Brunswick,
and according- to terms which the latter will first
assent to1 And thisdividedjurisdiction is all that
in future is left to Maine ovei the lioostook
countiy, which, accoiding to the understanding
heietotoie enteied into,and nowto be abrogated,
was, until now, yielded to her exclusivejuusdic-
tron
The Aroostook countiy, now the immediate
theatei of Br itish aggression, is a poition of the
dtsputed territory that has at all times heretofore
been within the exclusive jurisdiction of Massa-
chusetts and Mame In claiming exclusive ¡uns-
tliction over it now,as Maine does, andas 1 uust
she will persist m doing at all hazaids, she is not
lt extending theexercise of juusdiction within the
disputed terntoty beyond the limits within which
it has hitheito usually been exercised by" her
Buthoiitica, but the British Province ísdoingthis
in direct violation of the existing agreement be-
tween th" two Governments of the United States
and Gieat Britain
Undet such encumstances, is it just towaids
Maine to foice hci to fill back from her position,
founded in right and in express stipulation, too,
and to íeceivc into htr acknowledged possessions
and tei r ¡tory a concurrent jurisdiction on the part
of the Bnti&h Provinces ' Sn, let who will go for
it, 1 go against it.
Mr Chauman, Maine is either right or she is
wrong in het position. If she is right, she prop-
etlyasksantt expects to be sustained byher sister
States and the Government. If she is wrong, then
say so to her, and leave her to her fate. She
claims to have exclusive jurisdiction of so much
of the disputed termory as is known by the name
of the Aioostook countiy—the same that is now
thieatened with invasion—not only by treaty
stipulation, but by long continued possession, and
by your lite agreement of 1832 and 1833, also,
with the British Government, and if she be right
n this., will you compel her to letieat lgnomm-
lously befoie the the threats of Sir JonnHarvey,
oi to fall back and receive into that temtorya
concurrent jurisdiction on the part of the British
Province' If it be clear that she asks now no
more than she has always possessed exclusively,
will you foice her to submit to a partneiship pos-
session of it with Great Britain > And if she wilt
not submit to this humiliation, will you refuse all
suppoit to hei'
Sir, such a policy adopted towards Maine
would change not only herrights, but hei uniform
relations towards both this Government and the
British Government. And will you thus treat
her citizens, when they have, in confident reliance
upon your authority, with a chivalrous spirit and
patr.otism which I tiust will ever characteuze
them, left their homes, their families, bidding de-
fiance to the fiosts and the snows of their climate,
and taken the field in defense of their wonted and
heretofore acknowledged possession' Will you
abandon them, when they have sworn in the face
of the woild, upon the altáis of the God who
made them, not to retreat, not to retract one inch
of their ughtful possession > Will this Congress,
with their own records before them, thus consent
vutually to take sides with, or countenance the
pretensions of the enemies of Mame, and the en-
emies of our common country'
Too much of the argument already made upon
this floor has aimed at only a resistance of the
British Government to exclusive jurisdiction over
the Aroostook country. I know it is exclusive
jurisdiction that Sir John Harvey is putting forth
But, sn, this course of argument winks out of
sight the true chumand position of Maine, which
foibids even the admission of concur) ent jurisdic-
tion with the British Province over this portion
of the disputed territory. It is an exclusive and
not a divided juusdiction that Maine claims, and
so the House and country should understand it.
If she backs out from this claim, or submits to
leceive the concurren tj uusdiction of Gieat Butain
within that portion of the disputed temtoiy
known as the Aroostook countiy, she yields to
dishonor, and will be unworthy of your support.
Su,I do not, I will not believe that she will do
this, or that she is capable of it, for by every docu-
ment that has emanated fiom her Governors and
Legislatuie for the last ten years, and most of all
by her present Governor and present Legislature,
she stands pledged to herself, to her country, and
to the wot Id, to risk all that she has, to sacrifice
all that she is, or hopes to be hereafter, rather
than do this deed of dishonor.
I am not mistaken in thus presenting to tbe
committee the claim and position to which Maine
finds herself thus strongly pledged And to
piove this incontestably, I will refer to the recent
exponents of Su John Harvey on the one side,
and of the present Executive of Maine on the
othei, of their lespecttve positions
In a lettei of Sir John Ilaivey to Governor
Fairfield, dated Febiuaiy 13, 1839,, the former
says
*' Sir I havt just heard, with the utmost surprise and
regret, that without the comtesy ot any pievious intimation
whatevi r to tins Government, an aimed force irom the
State of M line has ent red the tcrritorj the claim to which
is in dispute betuizt Great Britain and the United states
and which it has been agreed betuizt the two General Gov
ernmenis shall remain m the exclusive possession and jw is
diction of England until that claim be determined
" It has been mv dutv, on more than onr occasion, to ap
prise the Executive Government of Maine that my nistruc
tioris do not peimrt me to suffer any interference with that
possession and juruoii.tion until the question of ri%hl shall
haxe been finally decided in d scusslon betu-ixt the tuo Gen
eral Goictniitents "
Such is the position of the British Governor. It
goesfoi an exclusive ]uusdiction ovei the Aroos-
took country, which " will not suflci any inter-
ference with that possession " It claims, more-
over, an agreement between the United States
and Gieat Butain, by which the whole disputed
terutory is yielded to this same exclusive juris-
diction of the Bntish Province
This pretension was met by Governor Fair-
field in the following manner, under date of Feb
ruary 19
' Now, sir I cannot hesitate to say that, in mv opinion  |

the way
" \ our Excellency entreats me immediately to recall the
forces now upon the ten rtory, and then adds,' It is proper
that I should acquaint your Excellency that I have directed
a strong foree ot her Majesty's troops to be in readiness to
support her Majesty's authority, and to protect lier Majes-
ty's subjects m tire disputed territory, in tire event of tills
request not being lmtpedrately comphed with. 
" In reply, I have to say that the territory bordering upon
the Aroostook river has always been,as I regard the facts,
in the possession and under the jurisdiction of Massachu-
setts and Maine, that more than thirty years ago, Massa-
chusetts surveyed and granted large tracts of it, which have
ever since, rn some way, been possessed by the grantees,
and those claiming under them , that the rest of it was sur-
veyed by and some of it divided between Massachusetts
and Maine, soon alter the latter became an independent
State, that both States have long been in the Irabu of
granting permit  to cut timber there without being molested
Irom any quarter, that many persons have purchased these
lands of Maine, and entered into their actual occupation ;
and that m various other ways Maine has exercised i juris-
diction, which may fairly be regarded as cxclusrve, ovei this
territory Under these circumstances information was re-
ceived that a body ot armed men had gone into this tern
tory, and were cutting vast quantities ot the timber, defy-
ing tbe power of tins State to prevent them On these facts
being communicated to the Legislature, the two branches
immediately directed the land agent to take with him a suffi-
cient iorce to arrest these depredators, and to break up therr
enterprise. The partv of the land agent rs now m the ter-
ritory, engaged in executing the tru^t with whtch it was
charged, and, with my consent, will never leave it while
the protection of the property of the State fiom plunderers
renders it necessary for them to remain If your Excel-
lency chooses to send an armed force to attempt their ex-
pulsion, Í can only say that this State will endeavor to meet
such an attempt as it will deserve I have no threats to
make, no boastings to indulge Ff Maine does her duty, as
I tiust in God she will, nothing that 1 could say in advance
would add to the glory oí her career If she pioves recre-
ant to her duty, and tarn 'ly submits to be expeled from
her terruoiy by a force that the could successtully resist,
nothing that I could say would tend to diminish the meas-
ure of her ignominy and disgiace "
In a communication of the Governor of Maine
to the Legislature of that State, referring to the
seizuie of the land agent of Maine and his assist-
ants, upon theAtoostook territory, by provincial
authonty, it is again said.
" No palliating circumstance for this outrage can be found
m eier  a pretense that the place where it was committed is
willnn the concurrent jurisdiction of the two Governments,
much less that the British Government have had exclusive
jurisdiction Lands even higher up, and beyond this, were
surveyed and granted hv the State ot Massachusetts more
than thirty years ago , and Massachusetts and Mame have
lon<? been m the habtt of granting permits to cut timber
upon the Aroostook lands, without being, to my knowledge,
molested from iny quarter, to say nothing of the sale and
actual occupation of the land itself"
In the same Governor's letter to the President
of the United States, on this subject, under date
of February 16, 1839, it is said
" These gentlemen have been seized upon territory which
is regarded bv Maine is having alvv ays been within her ex-
clusive pos&issioii and jurisdiction, as will appi ar by a few
of tire ficts alluded to in my message "   *       *       *       *
1 I will only add, that in this State there is but one feeling
upon this subject, and that is of det p mdignatton at the
out] ages that have been perpetrated, and a fixed and un
yielding determination not to submit to the degrading terms
jrojtosid b\¡ the Lieutenant Governor of New JBrunsuicl —
rhat of withdrawing irom the Aroostook ten itorv, and aban
donin^ our «oil t) loreigrrers, and our properly to a band of
aimí d plunderers "
Sir, with the evidence before the committee of
the plain undeistanding between the United Slates
and Great Butain, that Maine should retain her
exclusive jurisdiction over so much of the dis
putcd tor rito y as had been within hei posses-
sion, and that Gieat Butain should retain her
exclusive jurisdiction ovei such portion of the
disputed terutory as her Piovince had been ac-
customed to exercise exclusive luusdic'ion cei,
and that neither pariy should extend its juusdic-
tion beyond such limits, with this evidente be-
fore the committee of tut exclusive jurisdiction
which Maine has foi yeais, and Massachusetts
fot years anterior, exercised over the Aioostook,
with the íeco.ded evidence, also, of this as well
as of the other branch of Congiess before us,
that the title of Maine to the whole fee of the soil
is absolute, and founded in the most unquestion-
able justice, with the evidence, yet furthei, of
the determination of Mame not to yield one jot
or tittle ot hei claim to either the fee orthe juris-
diction of this portion of the disputed ttii torv,
ui til the dispute shall be settled, if evei—how is
it to be expected, or can i' be called just, that
Maine should back out fiom thu soil, under any
pietensc o' compiomise, oi by any application
of force, and consent to leceive >nto it the equal
