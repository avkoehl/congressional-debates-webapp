FORT MONROE, May 16, 1863-1 p. m.

Colonel Foster is covering our work, which is in good progress on the railroad near Carrsville. He has been engaged with the enemy more workmen. Yesterday the enemy advanced within canister range, but was driven back with considerable loss. On our side a caisson was riddled, a horse killed, and 9 men wounded.

The iron is arriving in Norfolk. When we get on the other road we shall probably have some sharp fighting.
