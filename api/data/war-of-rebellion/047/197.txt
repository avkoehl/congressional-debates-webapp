with our limited means, and from other obstacles, it has become necessary to throw up a work on Shell Point with the utmost celerity, which shall sweep the front of Battery Wagner, with at least the fire of one 10-inch columbiad and a Brooke rifled piece. This work, therefore, you will place under construction, in charge of an energetic officer, with orders to push it forward with all possible dispatch. There must also be provided shelter for an infantry support of two companies, and positions for three 10-inch mortars.

The columbiad and Brooke guns will be arranged on traversing carriages, and the work must be carefully protected from enfilade from Morris and Back Islands.

Further, the 10-inch columbiad at Fort Johnson must be so arranged as also to command the front face of Battery Wagner.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: As was determined in the conference with you this afternoon, in view of the operations of the enemy on Morris Island, the chief engineer has been instructed to construct at once a battery on Shell Point, James Island, for one 10-inch columbiad and one 6.40-inch Brooke rifled gun, on traversing carriages, with provision for three 10-inch mortars.

The 10-inch columbiad at Fort Johnson will also be so arranged as to command or sweep the face of Battery Wagner.

In the same connection, the 10-inch columbiad, now in the hands of the chief of ordnance, ready for service, will be added to the armament of Fort Moultrie; and you will also increase that armament by two 10-inch columbiads, to be removed as soon as practicable from Fort Sumter, their places to be supplied by "dummies," which Major Hutson Lee has been directed to have made.

The 10-inch columbiad, recently received, will be mounted in the Shell Point Battery when a carriage shall be provided.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
