HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that everything was very quiet in my front during yesterday and last night. One deserter from Thirty-eighth North Carolina was received last night and two more from same regiment this morning. They are now on their way to army headquarters.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864.

General MEADE:

I am trying all I can to excite the energy and soldierly pride of this corps, and I think it would help the whole army very much to publish an order from your headquarters saying what battles may be inscribed on the regimental flags by those present in them since you have commanded the Army of the Potomac, and also authorizing all men in those battles to wear the battle chevron for each battle they were in. A board might be appointed in each corps to carry out the order by deciding whether the regiment was entitled to the honor. The operation would be immediate and would be better than to have a report made and claims submitted, which would take considerable time.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 19, 1864-8 p.m. (Received 9 p.m.)

Major-General WARREN:

I will reply fully to your telegram in reference to inscribing battles on flags so soon as I can ascertain what has been done previously in this matter and what are my powers in the premises. I am under the impression the War Department alone has the power to give the necessary permission.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS:

Nothing unusual occurred in my front during the last twenty-four hours.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.
