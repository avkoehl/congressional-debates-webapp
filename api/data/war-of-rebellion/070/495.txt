Lieutenant THOMAS H. WELLSTED,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you of the receipt of your communication in relation to detail of thirty men. Immediately on the return of my adjutant (Lieutenant Hill) he ordered the detail, half from the Twenty-first New York Cavalry and the balance from the First New York Veteran Cavalry. Some half an hour after making the detail I received a communication from Lieutenant Colonel J. S. Platner, commanding First New York Veteran Cavalry, stating that he could not fill his detail except by taking some of his regiment who had, just returned from a scout since yesterday. I then made a detail of one non-commissioned officer and fifteen men of the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and received and answer from Captain Ashell F. Duncan, commanding, that he had not sufficient men present equipped to fill same.
