SAVANNAH, December 15, 1864.

(Via Hardeeville 16th.)

His Excellency President DAVIS:

Sherman has secured a water base, and Foster, who is already nearly on my communications, can be safely and expeditiously re-enforced. Unless assured that force sufficient to keep open my communications can be sent me, I shall be compelled to evacuate Savannah.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 15, 1864-11. 30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE,

Savannah, GA.:

Under no circumstances must you be cut off from junction of your forces with those of General Jones; the safety of Georgia and South Carolina depends upon the results.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

CHARLESTON, December 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE;

Should there be no works at Tunbridge and Mongan's landings, east of Screven's Ferry Causeway, have them erected fortwith. Rifle pits and batteries for two field pieces might answer for the present. Have creeks leading [to] them obstructed with oak trees or piles and torpedoes. Colonel Clarke, engineer, can inform you.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Savannah, GA., December 15, 1864-8 p. m.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Izard's Place, Savannah River:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 3. 30 p. m. has been received, and I am directed by Lieutenant-General Hardee to say, in reply, that Ferguson's brigade had battery be sent over at once. If the need of it should prove to be greater on the left than on the right bank of the river it can be returned to you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAVANNAH, GA., December 15, 1864-10. 15 p. m.

General WHEELER:

GENERAL: The enemy is reported at Verard's plantation in considerable force. It is all important they should be driven from that position without [delay]. For this purpose take any portion of the command you destined for this side of the river.

Respectfully,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
