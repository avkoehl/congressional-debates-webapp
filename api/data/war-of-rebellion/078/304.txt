LEXINGTON, August 26, 1864.

Brigadier General HUGH EWING,

Commanding Second DIVISION, Louisville, Ky.:

The general desires me to send you following, received by him:

JACKSBOROUGH, TENN., August 26, 1864.

Captain Gross Palmer returned about 12 o'clock last night. He went near Clinton; ascertained there was a rebel force, estimated at 4,000 under command of Wheeler, then in Clinton, having crossed Clinch River during the afternoon. They are coming this way, and I think are not far off. The troops here evacuated last night. We expect to leave soon.

J. JONES,

Operator.

Send Twenty-sixth and FIFTY-second Kentucky here by the quickest possible route. Send the Forty-eighth Kentucky to Hopkinsville and Princeton. They must guard that front. Have the Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry mounted immediately, drawing horses from the quartermaster's department and have them ready to march here upon receiving orders.

CHAS. M. KEYSER,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant Colonel C. H. HOWARD,

Troops must not be taken from the MISSISSIPPI River without first communicating with General Canby. General Sherman and General Canby both so understand it.

A dispatch just received from General Canby states that General A. J. Smith's command has already been detached to co-operate with General Sherman.
