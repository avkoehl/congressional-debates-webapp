The gentleman talked w ith great eloquence and great ingenu
ity in favor of pushing this country into a war, under the masK
of a very great solicitude for peace- He has drained the wholt 
world of argument to pi ove f o this House ihat, m the event of a
war, we can burn London, and to establish the principle that
there exists no such thing as the ught of search m time ol war-
Now, the two parts of the gentleman's argument do not seem
to me to agree together If we do go to war—m fav or of which
the gentleman has brought forward the attract ve arguments
that a war will pay all our State debts to England, and ena-
ble us to bum the city of London, and establish the doctrine
that there exists no right of search m time of war—it seems to
me that the thing most essential to us of all others will be this
veiy right of search How does the gentleman expect we are
to burn London, wuhout we have the right of searching neutiai
vessels at sea1 I ask him, and I ask this House, if tl is veiy
right will not be the most powerful of all the mean  we can
emplo) against Great Britain? And whether, though it may
not enable us to succeed in burning London, it will not enable
us to avail of the bravery ofournoble ta-sto meet upon the 
ocean and to capture that property of our ent my which they
will otheiwise protect, by usir g the flag of eveiy neutral nation
under heaven1 lotake away t ns right would at once ibiow a
shield ovei the entire mass of Br tish commerce, which wou'd
"II c mtinue to he carried on in perfect safety from any injury
by us
What beaung the arguments of the learned gentleman could
possibly have on the question of our retaining a full minister
at the Courts of Austria and Prussia, I am totally at a loes to
conjectme ButI do see that, undercolor of this motion, he
has undertaken to instruct the new British Minister how ha
may, with the greatest po=-&ihle facility, settle all the questions
between us and Great Britain, and gain for himself an earldom
And how, pray, is he to do it? Whyt by dimply yielding eveiy
thing on every point m dispute This, I confess, eeems to me
to be at least a very unusual basis of negotiation
[Mr Incibrsoll    I did not eay nny thing like that ]
If the gentleman did not in substance say that, I áíust very
greitly have misunderstood him
[Mr Inqehsoll    I sai 1 no such thing ]
The gentleman assumes that theie are five points in contro
versy, and he says that on every one of them Great Britain is
the aggressor, and that the only way to settle them is foi her to
agree to submit to everything we demand He included even
tne case of the Creole
Mr Ii^gehsoli, What I said was that England is the
aggicssor on cvciy point, but that most of them, I conceive,
die still sus-certib'e of satisfactory adjustment, that the Creole
case, the Maine que-tion, and the Oregon question, 1 suppose,
may be amicabl) anavifjed of the Carol ne af7aii,I uaid that

deplorable misstep in that case I think myself entitled to for
beaiance in retuin foi th^ti have cxercisej Lastly, I paid
that the demand of search visitation, or any thing of the kind,
nevei can be settled, but must be abandooedoi ieci ted]
Mr Adams Well, sir, the gentleman has again liad fus saj,
henow takes lack whatl undo ¡stood him to advnee, which
wis ihat t ndl.l the fivt point" id d s( ute Gieat Britain was the
aggressor, and"that it was ourduty toyie- d nothing I appeal
no to the gentleman, but to the conscience of every member oí
this committee, and to their common cenbe, to decide whether
that was not what ihe gentleman did eay Ii he ehooses now
to recant it all, let him do it
[Mr Incersolí I do not cl oo«e to recant an> thing Al-
though, as usual the gent) man chooses toindulgt his pación,
and play the termagant whenever any thing is &atd wh*eh doea

was rather a tender place, and that it would be best foi him to
get over it as s-oon as he could He ct-i tainly did add, in a Jower
and a somewhat subdued tore, ' ps wt s-*y "
The gentleman has gone through such a range of the laws of
nation , and of the condition of the worid and ras altogether
made us a discourse quite equal to "the admirable Cnchton,"
who made speeches offhand on all sous of subjects that were
pioposed to him that iea!ly I feel myself unprepared to meet
him on a ereat man) of the points he made, and tl erefore I
shall confine myself to a few of them oi ly ftr h deed I can find
not a point in all his speech which bears at all upon h s own
motion What has the question alout burning London or
burning New York to do with oui sending a full mmisier to the^
courts of \rienna or Berlin'' But I dosay that the whole course
ofhis argument seemed to me under a piofession  i Mving to
usaud to the Biitish envoy a perfectsolution of all the disputed
questions between this country and Cnglatd, tote aimed,
throughout, at driving usintoa war, and preventing the piesent
