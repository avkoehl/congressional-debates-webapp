Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Your communication of 9 p. m. was received during the night, together with acompanying papers. General Adams has come up and will leave to-day at 10 a. m. General Lee will leave with Ferguson's brigade at 12 m. We will take the route to your right, through Panola and Scooba, as the Lauderdale Springs road may be rather dangerous.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

CAPTAIN: You will direct General Ross to draw in his scouts, &amp;c., and move by the most direct route to Scooba. Starke's brigade will move at once in that direction. Tell Ross to move without delay. Send my escort here immediately and join me as soon as you can.
