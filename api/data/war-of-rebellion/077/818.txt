duplicate of the bridge, already framed to replaced the older structure. Under an increased artillery fire the garrison of the block-house surrendered.

We captured 205 prisoners, 1 U. S. flag, and the colors of the Ninety-THIRD Illinois Regiment, a number of horses, arms, &amp;c., and killed and wounded 750 of the enemy; being, with the garrison of the block-house, over 1,000.

History will record the battle of Allatoona one of the most sanguinary conflict of the war; ad when it is remembered that the enemy fought from within their strong redoubts, the desperate deeds of daring performed by our troops in overcoming so many of the foe, a meed of praise is due to their heroic valor.

The artillery opened about 7 o'clock in the morning, and, except when the flag of truce was sent in, continued till 2 p. m. The assault, commencing about 10, continued unremittingly till 1. 30 p. m., and the rattle of musketry did not cease entirely till near 3 p. m., when it died away and a silence like the pall of death rested over the scene, contrasting so strangely with the previous din off battle.

I cannot do justice to the gallantry of the troops. No one faltered in his duty, and all withdrew from the place with the regret that General Sherman's movements-closing up behind us-forbid our remaining longer to force a surrender of the last work.

After leaving out the three regiments that formed no part of the assaulting force I had but a little over 2,000 men.

My entire loss in killed, wounded, and missing was 799, as follows:

 Killed. 	 Wounded. 	 Missing. 	 Captured

Cockrell's brigade.	 42	 182	 22	 . . .

*

Sears' brigade. *	 37	 114	 200	 . . .

Ector's brigade. 	 43	 147	 11	 . . .

staff. 	 . . . 	 . . . 	 . . . . 	 1

Total. 	 122	 443	 233	 1

Among the killed from Sears' brigade is Colonel W. H. Clark, Forty-sixth Mississippi. He fell in the advance near the enemy's works with the battle-flag in is hands. He was an excellent and gallant officer. Also were killed Captain B. Davidson and Lieuts. G. C. Edwards, J. R. Henry, and G. D. Davis.

Colonel W. S. Barry, Thirty-fifth Mississippi, and Major Partin, Thirty-sixth Mississippi, were wounded, together with Capts. R. G. Yates and A. J. Farmer, and Lieuts. J. N. McCoy, G. H. Bannerman, J. M. Chadwick, J. Coopwood, R. E. Jones, E. W. Brown, G. H. Moore, and Ensigns G. W. Cannon and a. Scarborough. Texas will mourn for the death of some of her bravest ad best men. Captain Somerville, Thirty-second Texas, was killed after vainly endeavoring to enter the last work, where his conspicuous gallantry had carried him and his little band. Captains Gibson, Tenth Texas; Bates, Ninth Texas; Conley, Twenty-ninth North Carolina, and Adjutant Griffin, Ninth Texas; Lieutenant Alexander, Twenty-ninth North Carolina, and Dixon E. Wetzel, Ninth Texas, were killed gallantly leading their men.

Brigadier General W. H. Young, commanding brigade, was wounded. Most gallantly he bore his part in action.
