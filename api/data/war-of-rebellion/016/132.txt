Numbers 1. Report of Major General John Pope, U. S. Army, commanding the Army of Virginia, with congratulatory orders.*
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA,Near Cedar Creek, August 10, 1862 - 5.45 a. m.

The enemy crossed the Rapidan day before yesterday, and yesterday advanced in heavy force against Culpeper. Their advance under Ewell had a very severe engagement yesterday with Banks' corps, in which the loss was heavy on both sides without decisive results. Both parties at dark occupied their original positions.

The army under my command and the whole force of Jackson confront each other, and the action has already begun. A very severe engagement will undoubtedly take place, the enemy being in very superior force and endeavoring to interpose between me and Fredericksburg. I will do the best I can, and if forced to retire will do so by way of Rappahannock Crossing. I hope, however, for better things.

So far the troops have behaved well.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.
