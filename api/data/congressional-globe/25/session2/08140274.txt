the emigrant tribes, there ¿re a numbei oí young
men of talent, well educated, and wanting employ-
ment These men, with ihe¡ assistance of the
superintendent and council, will be able to manage
all the business for their people within their Terri-
tory Offices «ill be cieated for them to aspire
to, and it will, I have no doubt, be iound the.
interest of both our Government and the Indians,
at no distant day, to withdraw every white man
ho'ding an office from the Territory, leaving the
Indians to manage their own concerns for them
selves
The expenditures will soon be still farther reduc-
ed, by discontinuing the artisans atpresent employ-
ed among the Indians undei treaty stipulations, as
above stated, all of whom, excepting two, are engag-
ed for limited periods Two are permanent, the
others are for the following pariods, viz during
the pleasure of the Piesident, 18 , at the discretion
oi Congiess, 4 , for five j can, 4, for ten year , 8,
foi sixteen jears, 3, for twenty veais, 4 , (or thirty
years, 5 , uncertain, 11
Some of them have been several yeais engaged,
and may soon be discharged In the j ear 1809,
the term of sen ice for the longest engagements
will expue At that period we can withdraw the
last of our mechanics from the service of the In-
dians, and it is pioper that we should do so
It w ill become the dut> of the held of the Indian
Depaitment to mtorni the Indians that our Go-
vernment will, at the end of the piesent engage-
ments lor wmte mechamos, disci ntvnue them I he
superintendent and all othel officers of the Tern
tory will see the necessity of placing Indian j ouths
in workshops either within then Territory or else-
where, to learn a'l bt inches of mechim m, to be
ptepartd for the time «hen our present engige-
ments to funu-h them will have expired
When we shall di lontinue the practice of fur
mshmg mechantes and laboiers to work for the
Indians, the etpensts of tie Territorial Govern-
ment will be reduced to $6,100 per annum
Not the least of the difficulties which «e have to
encounter m organizing the Indian Territory is to
reduce the salanes, and withdraw our agents, ar-
u ans, and others, employed among the Indians
These men are rolling in ease and luxury, receiving
better salaues than the States pay their officers,
higher ways than can be realized lrom the udina-
ry pursuit of life The salary of an Indian agent
is higher an the salary paid by some of our States
to their Governor Agents aie also furnished fuel,
quarters, clerk hire, and stationary, and to some a
laborer They will not willingly let go these com-
fertable places When a move is made in Con-
gress to retiench expenditures, they will be found
in this city urging then own claims to place Con-
gress should lake up this subject and reduce the
salarjespaul to most of them, twenty-five per cent
It will require some firmness in both the Executive
and Congress to reduce these extravagant expendi-
tures, and bring them down to the real wants of the
service But, sir, we are compelled to retrench if
we intend to fulfill our duty to the Indians or to
ouisehes I feel justifiad in saying, from neta
■very limitted acquaintance with the subject, that
we have become extravagant m making Indian
treaties, careless m appropriations, and wastefull
in the application of public money to the u-e of
the Indians, and to those employed by the Govern-
ment among them, and that retrenchment is neces
sary
Should tms b d become a law it will not be ne-
cessary to keep moie than lhree agents, and about
six sub-agents, m the employ of the Government
lor all the Indians not \uthm the territory An
awnt for the upper lakes, one at St Peter's, and
anothei at Council Bluffs, wth a half dozen subs
at suitable place-, will,in my opinion, be sufficient
It is bad policy for Congress to create agencies to
be scrambled for, and worse to advance them far
into the wilderness, and make it necessary to send
out a military force to protect them, the regular
werease of populat on, and the advances of our
settlements approach these people fast enough
The bill of the last session for organizing the
Indian territory y,as submitted to the consideration
oí eleven tribes, and was assented to by them
Tiiese tribes are Delawares, Shawatioes, Kickapoos,
Pottawotanues, Sauks of Missouu, Ioways, Weas,
Piankashas, Peonas and Kaskaskia, Kansas,
and Ottowa-^every one of these tribes approved
of the provisions of the bill, and desired the Go-
vernment to carry into effect without delay, and
each of these tribes sent to Congress, through the
Commissionei of Indian Affairs, a petition to that
effect An extract from one of these petitions is
found m page 65, of the annual report of the Com-
missioner of Indian Affairs, it concludes thus "with
all the foregoing pi opositions we are well pleased,
and we earnestly íequest the Government to cany
them into eflect as soon as practicable "
The Commissioner appointed to submit the bill
to some of the tribes, m his report, also printed,
and on our tables, says further "the agent for the
Pawnees, Oltoes, and Omihas, in a confeunce
held with him last summer, appeared confident,
that these thiee tribes would acquiesce in the mea-
sure Such, sa>!> he, is also my decided opinion
The subject has not been submitted to their conside-
ration "
1 have the pleasmc of a personal acquaintance
« ith Major Dougherty, the agent spoken of, have
long const 1 ared him an efficient businessman, and
1 emeitaiii, no doubt, that if he makes the effort,
all the tubts, foi tthuh lit is agent, will vield then
as-i nt and join the conledeiacy
To the Osi^es, duapaws, Sénecas, and Senec is
and Shawano?-, the subject has not been submitted
fe r then consideuition It is belli.veil that each of
these tribes woul 1 have been m favor of the mea-
suie if the subject had been properly explained to
them
No answei Ins been received fiom the Creeks,
the bill not hiving jeen submitted to them in a
formal marmu Some ol their Chiefs 1 under-
stind, are favorably inclined The Cheioktesand
Chiokasaws hav e expíes ed a disini hnition to c< me
mto the measmt This is «win.;, I have no doubt,
to enoneous information, ei bad counsel
It mav be laid down as a general rule, to
which there are but lew exci ptions, that whcrcv< r
the agent fi r a tube ol Indians is in favoi of the
measuie, th  Indians of his agency «ill agree to it
There is not i tribe of Indians m our country, ex-
cepting the Cheiokees east of the Mississippi, and
which is evidently undei the influence of bad coun-
sel, but what will yield their assent to any measure
that may be desirable with the Government to ac-
complish, piovidcd their agent doe? his duty If
he desire complaint, they will complain, if he de
sire peace, or war, he can influence his Indians to
conform t > his wishes Indeed sn so peifeetly
satisfied am*! of the unbounded influence of an
agent over these people, fhatwheievei an agent has
been in office a sufficient time to become acquaint-
ed with his Indians, U they refuse to conform to
the wi-hes ol the Government, I would justify the
Executive in dism ssing him, as being cither inca-
pable or unfaithful, euhei of which is good ground
for removal An mcapaole or unfaithful agent
liequentlj pi< duces difficulties, and sometimes
sueh as end m blood We owe it to the people of
Missonr anil Arkansas to complete our plan of de-
fences of the Wtstein frontier with all possible
despatih I have no fears of a rupture between
the whites and the tril e sent to their Western bor
der from cast of the Mississippi, but strong foits
should be speedily elected md well garrisoned,
to prevent combinations or collision between the
i migrant tribes and the numerous tribes of the
Rocky Mountains thit would bring upon us a
bh7e of vv ar from the Sabine, m the Southwest, to
the great Lakes of the North, and which would
certainly retard, and might forevei preient us
from lealiymg the fond hope we now enteitam ol
seem? the Indians of the Territory become, under
our proteolu n, an enlightened civil community
Tor the piesent, we mast keep a military force
near them While they remain untamed savages n
is indispensable that we keep them withm hearing
of a morning and evening gun, and the roll of t e
dram , but this should not b° lo iked to as the per-
manent policy of the Government The rod can
sometimes be advantageously holdenover the cftild
in minority, but, lamentable, indeed, must be the
condition ol a people who can only be kept in
bounds by the  presence of physical force.   We
must strive to enlighten their minds and elevate
their character by moral power, not by physical
force, looking to the time when we can, without
danger of harm to (hem, or to us, withdraw our
troops from their presence, and leave them to de-
pend on then own resources, not lo«kmg up to us
to furnish them the most common necessaries of
life, that are within the reach of every inhabi-
tant of North America, of ordinary intellect, and
common industry Thev should be taught that, as
man is a perishable being, he owes it to himself to
make exei Hon to support his existence, not depend-
ing on the spontaneous productions of nature, or
upon the exertions of others, as they have heretofore
done So long as we I urnish artisans and laborers,
and supply provisions, to the Indians, and continue
our agents to administer to their wants, they will
look up to and depend on us It belongs to human
natutt lo indulge hstlessness when an opportunity
is affmded us to do so Necessity promptsto indus-
try and exeition These people have depended on
oui presents and annuities for half a century We
should undeceive them at once, by letting them
know that, within the Indian Temtory, we will
supply them with artisans and laborers no longor
than to the expiration of out present engagements,
the last of which will terminate in 1859, twenty-one
Viars hence, except two blacksmiths that are per-
manent If we teach them division of property,
labor, and the elements of Government, and protect
them from foicign emissaries and invasions by the
stiong arm of this Government, u e have good rea-
son to look forward with the confident hope of see-
ing them, at no distant day, emerge from degrada-
tion, and become an independent state, and its citi-
zens an intelligent, industrious, and happy people
REMARKS OF MR. YELL,
O* Arkansas,
In llie House oj Rep cienlaiives, Jlpnl 16, 1838—In
Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union, on a bill leported by Mr Lincoln of
Massachusetts, making an appropriation of meney
for the destruction of the new Treasury building,
and for other purposes
Mr YCLL addressed the Committee as follows
Mr Chairman, it was not originally my design
to say one word on the merits of this bill at the
present stage of its existence, but as 1 find that it
has already elicited much debate, and the hounds
are out, I may as well utter what I have to say on
this occasion I am not prepared for a set speech,
and will occupy the attention of the committee for
a few moments only
I am an opponent of the bill, Mr Chairman, and,
at the very threshold, I protest against its passage
I behold in it, sir, the commencement of another
scheme for a splendid and a profligate Government,
a scheme foi the recommencement of that system
of expenditure and profligacy which distinguished
other dajs, and rendered immortal another Admi-
nistiation, when we had splendid projects for a
vast chain of internal improvement on the earth
below and m the heavens above, a scheme for the
projection and comp etion of " light houses" irt the
slues, of beacons buoys, and palaces, and all those
fanciful projects which a versatile fancy could origi-
nate and an administration of idolaters could, if
they had consulted their own wishes, have carried
into execution Mr Chairman, the storied debm
of that Administration has now become a matter of
history, but, su, it is yet recollected, and, as I op-
posed its existence with all my zeal, I shall now,
and ever after, I trust, be found among the most
strenuous of those wl o lend a helping hand to obli-
teiate and destroy the balelul example which it set
for the lmnamn of subsequent Administrations et
the laws ami pnncip'es of the Constitution, and the
obligations of the overrment I object to this
bill, and protest against its passage, for other, and,
I trust, not unpatriotic reasons than that which I
have alieady stated, I behold, sir, in this bill, a
feature and a design, both of which are too palpa-
ble to escape the observation of the most reckless
observer When the preceding Administration
came into power, it was pledged to carry out tbe
principles of reform m the abuses of the Govern-
