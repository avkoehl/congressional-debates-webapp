HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

On receiving your last dispatch we determined on not making any further attack. Our left advanced to-day about two miles. Though we did not succeed in penetrating the enemy's main line, our men held firmly all the ground they gained, and in some instances very close to the enemy's parapet. We shall probably get off all our dead and wounded early this evening. It may reach 1,000. Among the wounded is Colonel Chamberlain, First Brigade, First Division. Your direction has been obeyed in regard to straightening the line. I should like to retain the cavalry picket on my left. The enemy's position in our front is exceedingly difficult to carry by assault if well defended.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN:

Your dispatch received. I have three brigades on other side of the railroad, and I think it quite desirable to hold the position, but if you withdraw I must also. Have you fully decided to withdraw? Please answer at once.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864-10 p.m.
