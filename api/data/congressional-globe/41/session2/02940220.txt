The Tariff—Mr. Asper.
41st Cong.,..2d Sess.
hear of few sales, except about 200 tons No. 1 crane
U forge is dull at £20 to $51, and white and
mottled $28 to $29.
"Scotch pig is slow of sale, and m small supply, at
$23 50 to 834 for Eglinton, and $37 to $38 for Glengar-
nock, from yard. . ,
" Manufactured iron is steady at $/8 to §80 for best
refined bar, and $75 to 76 for common. The mills are
generally anxious for orders.
"Scrap—No. 1 wroughtcontmu.es in fair reauest
at §40 to $41, while cast is dull at $26 to $28.
" Mail*.—The market for American has been quiet,
owing to the low prices at which English can be pur-
chased. An improvement is expected ere long, when
orders now reserved must be put in hand; we quote
$71 to $74 at works.
"Old rails aro as last quoted."
These quotations are made up as favorable as
possible to the iron manufacturers,^ it is their
organ ; so that English and American bar iron
is quoted at the same rate, and you may go
over the entire list and you will find railroad
iron quoted in the same way. The tariff fixes
the price of iron and steel in this country to
the consumer.
Now, is tbere any necessity for this high
tariff upon iron? Weweretold, when the tariff
of 1846 was adopted and the tariff of 1842 was
repealed, that ruin would come upon the coun-
try, that manufactures would stop, and that
the producer would find no market for the
article that he raised—his wheat and corn and
whatnot. Now, how does the production under
that tariff of 1846 compare with the production
since? I quote the following from Mr. Wells's
report of 11568-09:
"Production of pig iron in 1830, 165,000 ton?; in
1810,347,000 tons; increase in 10 years, 110 per cent.
"Pioduotion in 1845, 48G.0UQ tons; increase in 5
years, 40 per ccnt.
"Production in 1830, 501,000 tons; increase in 10
years, 03 per cent.
"Production in 1355, 751,000 tons; increase in 5
years, 33 per cent.
"Production in 1S60, 913,000 tons; increase in 10
} ears, 01 per ccnt.
"It thus appears that the great annual increase
in the production of pig iron took place prior to the
year 1S40, and for 30 years was remarkably uniform
t>L thcrate of 10 to 11 per cent, per annum ; and that
:>iijce then, no matter what has be«n the charaetor of
the legislation, whether the tariff was low or high,
whether tho condition of the country was one of war
or peace, tho increase of the production has been at
the average of about 8 per cent, per annum, or more
than doublo the ratio of tho incroaso of popular
tion."
From this it appears that the revenue tariff
of 1846. when duty on iron in pigs and bars was
24 per cent, ad valorem, was greater than it has
ever been before or since, aud that the increase
in the decade between 1850 and 1800 was
nearly double that of any other, and during the
labl three years of the decade the duty was
only 15 per cent, ad valorem. I have seen the
great iron interest of the Mahoning valley,
Ohio, grow up under this revenue tariff and
prosper, making wealth and comfort for all
concerned in the business. This shows that a
high tariff is not necessary for the prosperity
of the iron interests. So that during the period
between 1850 and 1860 there was a larger in-
crease in the production of pig iron in the
country than there has ever been since. What
does it cost to manufacture pig iron?
Mr. MAYNAUD, Will the gentleman have
the goodness to include in his table the ratio
of increase of pig iron between the enactment
of the tariff of 1842 and its repeal by the
operation of the tariff of 1846?
Mr. ASPER. I have it here. The items are
as follows:
"Increasein theproduefcion of pig iron: in 1810,
347,000 tons; in 1845, 486,000; in 1850, 564,755; in 1855,
754,178; in I860, 913,770."
Now is it necessary, looking at the cost of
manufacture ? I have here, sent rue in a letter
from a gentleman m high position in St. Louis,
a statement from the actual record made by a
manufacturing company at Carondelet, Mis-
souri, which I ask the Clerk to read.
The Clerk read as follows:
"The following is a record taken from the books of
tho Carondolet Companv, of ono week's work, the
cost of coal and ore being allowed at the extrava-
gant rates above stated, with 25 per cent, allowance
for waste of coal:

Adding these items, the company made tho cost of
iron that week over $22/'
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I ask that
my colleague's time may be extended.
Mr. DAWES. I hope the gentleman's time
will be extended; -we have not given him a fair
chance.
The CHAIRMAN. How much more time
does the gentleman wish ?
Mr. ASPER. About fifteen minutes.
The CHAIRMAN. If there is no objection,
the gentleman's time will be extended fifteen
minutes. The Chair hears no objection.
Mr. ASPER. I thank the committee for its
indulgence. I would not have asked it but for
the fact that I was interrupted. Now, sir, the
record of the Carondelet Company shows that
$21 was the actual cost of the manufacture of
iron, or, adding the interest and the cost of
repairs, §22 ; this, too, with a monopoly in the
coal used and in the iron ore and transportation
of it to the furnace.
I refer now to a letter from Brown, Bounell
& Co., of Youugslown, Ohio, in which they say
that it cost tbem $25 a ton. Here is their letter
to Professor Waterhouse, of St. Louis:
Office or Brown, Boxnell & Co..
Maiion-ing "YVoeks, xoungstown, Ohio,
July 8. 1868.
Dear Sir: Wc are just in rcceipt of a letter from
our friend, W. 0. Porrest, esot., St. Louis, together
with a few lines attached from yourself. We have
pleasure in replying to the question proposed.
In our manufacture of pig metal we use about
three fourths of Lake Superior and one fourth of
native ore to tho ton of pig. The lake ore cosis, de-
livered at our furnaces, about $9, and the native ore,
which is found around us, S3 per ton. Black Band
ore is mined in considerable quantities, mid which,
when roasted, yields a good percentage, say 50 per
cent., at a cost of $5 per ton. Tiio coal we use is of
excellent auality for making iron, being freo from
hurtful extraneous matter, a pure carbonaceous cool,
which wo get from our own mines, bringing it by
railroad about six miles to our works, and costing
about §2 or $2 50 per ton. It takes or 2t tons of
coal to reduce one ton of metal. The i«mostonc u^cd
as a flux we got delivered to us at tfl 12i per ton,
and the whole co^t of making 1 ton of pig metal is
about $25.
Should you over visit this region, we shall be
pleased to sec you and give any additional informa-
tion in our power.
Very respectfully,
BROWN, BOXNELL & CO.
Professor Waterhouse.
Since that date they have published a state-
ment in which they put it at $30 per ton. But
when it is fairly sifted it appears that their
statement is too large ; that $22 or $23 a ton
is about the correct statement.
Another gentleman, from Pennsylvania, says
that his furnace, while he was connected with
it, laid down iron in the city of New York
at $25 per ton. The following extract taken
from Mr. Wells's reply to the proprietors of
the Lehigh Crane Iron Company, and other
companies of a recent date, shows the actual
fact;
"January 2l,lS70.
4<Sir:.I have looked over my old memorandum
books with a view of writing you, because I am satis-
fied that the estimate you make of tho cost of iron is
fully high enough,
"I find we made in March, 1867, 985 tons, the cost
of which per ton is noted as follows;
Ore  $7 11
Coal    10 01
General charges        5 27
Total     $22 39
"In April of the same yearthero were produced
825 tons, as follows:
Ore -  $8 18
Coal  8 05
General charges....  5 83
Total;."   $22 06
"Tho interest on investment does not form any
part of these expenses. My estimate for the k*on
delivered in New York used to be $26 per ton. You
will notice a difference in the cost ol the items at
different times. Wo had sometimes very poor coal.
Then if the furnace worked badly, tho cost would
be necessarily increased."
Again, i present the following proceedings
of a meeting at Albany, New York, held on
the 18th January,1870, for the purpose ef organ-
izing a company to go into the manufacture of
iron. The proceedings were published in the
Albany Evening Journal and Albany Argus
of January, from whence they were taken by
Mr. Wells, Special Commissioner of the Rev-
enue, and used by him in the article before
referred to. The statement of Mr. Sacket is
so remarkable that I copy it here. He says:
"The ores required to make it will coston an aver-
age, delivered here, $5 75 per ton, and it will take
2 tons of them^to make a ton of iron. Limestone
will cost about $2 per ton. and it will require t of a
ton to the ton of iron. Tho whole cost of a day's
running expenses, including everything, from the
superintendent down, allowing liberally, will be$350
or ^5 per ton.
"Wo will estimate office expenses liberally, at
$10,000 per annum, or 50 cents per ton.
"Interest on capital stock, including ordinary wear,
tear, and loss, 10 per cent., or $40,000 per annum.
"The great contingency to which furnaces are sub-
ject is a stoppage for repairs. It is my opinion that
furnaces can be so built and operated, by using care,
as not to blow out lor repairs oftener than once in
5 years.
"In England and Scotland it is customary to run
10 and 15 years. But let us suppose that we will have
to repair 1 every 3 years. Tho cost of so doing will
bo about $20,000; but we will set aside &10,00U per
annum for this purpose.
" To sum up, a ton ofiron costs:
"For 2 tons of ore at $5 75 $11 50
Forl{- ton of coal at S6 50  8 12,
For i ton of limestone at SI 50  1 00
Labor per ton  5 00
Total   $25 62J
"Let us say $26 per ton is the primary cost, with
large allowances.
"On a make of 20,000 tons per annum, which, as
we have seen, is a moderate estimate, we have the
whole—
Cost of our production per annum $520,000
Add for office expenses  10,000
Ten per cent, interest and ordinary repair and
loss  -10,000
Set asiue lor extraordinary repair;-?  10,000
Making a total of   .8530,000
Or $29 per ton.
This makes tho value of a year's production..$720,000
Deducting cost of production ,  580,000
Leaves net earnings 8140,000
"We can pay a dividend of 35 percent, on a capital
stock of $400,000.
" I have not arrived atthis conclusion withoufclib-
cral allowances in all directions. It is not for one
year, but for three or five : and it is verified by the
fact that the Hudson Iron Company's works, built
in 1851, and which may reasonably be supposed not
up to the standard of modern excellence, have paid
dividends of 40 per cent, for the last three years, and
20 per cent, previously.
"The value of pig iron stocked here this winter is
from $36 to $40 per ton. I think none of the con-
sumers here have got a first-class No. 1 iron deliv-
ered atless than tho average of this, or $33 per ton ;
but in view of a falling market, let us call it S36 per
ton.
"Before you is a sample of iron made under my
personal supervision a tew weeks ago at Charlotte
]?urnace, near Rochester, to test the quality of ores
available to us hero in any quantity.
"I can safely say that it is better iron than is often
seen in Albany, and would meet all tho wants ot its
consumers.
"Tho furnace at which this sample of iron was
mado was started in January of last year. They de-
clared last year a dividend of 17per cent., and it was
submitted at the directors' meeting that thero was
stock enough on hand, and paid for, to pay off the
company's debt of about $100,000. The manager
told mo that this furnace cleared $50,000 the first six
months of her running."
Mr. Sackett farther continued:
"There i«« a sfrenuous effort now being mad© on
