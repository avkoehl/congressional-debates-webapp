two Napoleon guns only. Veatch has no guns, and when Andrews' six are withdrawn, the greater portion of our line will be exposed to artillery fire and no guns to reply.

HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL STEELE,April 8, 1865.

Colonel CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

In dispatch in regard to General Andrews' guns, I should have said twelve instead of six. I have sent sharpshooters into the swamp to pick off the officers on the gun-boats. They can get within eighty yards, and be perfectly secure.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,April 8, 1865.

Major General F. STEELE:

General Andrews' division will not be withdrawn at once, but when it is provision will be made to close up your lines with both artillery and infantry. General Totten has been ordered to detach temporarily from Granger's artillery four 3-inch guns, and have them report to you in lieu of Maryland's battery, under orders to leave.

Major General F. STEELE:

Order a sufficient party to be by daylight at the upper pontoon bridge, laid down this evening, about 500 yards above the old bridge. They will open a road from the bridge to the rear of General Garrard's position, running substantially parallel to the present road. Through the swamp it must be corduroyed.

P. JOS. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,April 8, 1865.

Major-General STEELE:

Please instruct Mr. Mayhew to use a signal of four rockets instead of three, as agreed upon. Should the rebels attempt to evacuate he must fire, from the point selected, two rockets in quick succession, wit an interval of not more than twenty seconds. After the lapse of two minutes he must fire two more rockets with the same rapidity. He may now be sent forward on his errand as soon as you find it convenient. Please acknowledge.

S. M. EATON,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi.
