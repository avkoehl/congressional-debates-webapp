THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1921
lie also presented a petition from Gitizens of
Hampshire, praying the abolition of the
flanking privilege; which was ordered to lie
on tlie table.
Mr. CRAGIN. I also present a memorial
of ship-builders and one hundred others, citi-
zens of Boston and vicinity, praying that the
officers of the naval Construction department,
which represents largely the people and me-
chanics of our country, may be placed in such
high position &S their responsibilities entitle
tliem to in any organization thatmay be estab-
lished. I move that it be referred to the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. THAYER presented a petition of citi-
zens of Nebraska, praying the establishment
of a mail route from Lincoln to Meriden,
Nebraska; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads.
Mr. WARNER presented the petition of A.
Murdoch, president of the Mobile and Ohio
Railroad Company, praying a reduction of
taxes on railroads ; which was referred to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. SPENCER. I present a statement show-
ing the amount of salaries of line officers of
the Navy under the present organization, and
under the provisions of the bill (S. No. 656) to
reduce the naval establishment of the United
States, introduced by me on Friday. It is
explanatory of the bill I introduced. I move
that it be printed for the information of the
Senate, and referred to the Committee on Naval
Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. THURMAN. I present a petition, very
numerously signed by persons who state that
they are citizens of the United States, andwho
ask Congress to make a donation to Wilber-
force University, stating that that is an institu-
tion of learning located near the cityofXenia,
county of Greene, in the State of Ohio ; that
'' pupilage is denied to no one on account of
race, color, or previous condition, yet this
institution is designed with particular refer-
ence to the education of the colored raceand
the petitioners ask in behalf "of said institu-
tion a donation of $50,000 of the allowance
made by your honorable body, the Congress
of the United States, for the education of the
freedmen of the South, a fund which shall not
be partial in its benefits, or from an^ sourcc
that yonr judgment may designate." Then the
petition proceeds to state reasons why the dona-
tion may be made from the funds designated.
This petition, it is proper to state, is signed
by a great many very eminent citizens of Ohio.
It is also proper to state that a number of sig-
natures which appear to it are all in the same
handwriting. I account for that in this way:
the petition was printed and evidently sent
abroad throughout the State to be signed, on
a single sheet; the person who sent it to me
probably copied some signatures that were
defaced or worn ont and pasted them all to-
gether. There are, however, a number of
original signatures to it, some of which I rec-
ognize as the signatures, as I said before, of
some of the most eminent citizens of Ohio. I
therefore present the petition as it is and for
what it may bo worth, saying again that I have
no doubt that those signatures which appear
to be all in one handwriting are copies of
original signatures that ought to have been
sent instead of these copies; but there are
original signatures here whose handwriting I
know. I move that it be referred to the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HARLAN presented a joint resolution
