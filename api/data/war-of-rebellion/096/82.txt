WASHINGTON, D. C., January 10, 1865-1.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Your telegram about forage has been transmitted to General Thomas. I think the difficulty is less the fault of Colonel Brown than the absolute scarcity in the Northern and Eastern States, and the difficulty of transportation now that the canals and rivers are frozen up. I will get what facts I can and write to you.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 10, 1865 . (Sen 3 p.m.)

General J. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, City Point:

General Parke desires me to ask that you will please cause him to be advised of the hour that General Meade leaves City Point for these headquarters, as he will himself then return to the headquarters of the Ninth Corps.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL:

(Through General-in-Chief)

We have only some three days' grain within our reach. So far as I am informed the animals have been on half rations since the 3rd instant. General Grant could not move his army, if he would, for want of forage. If there be plenty on the way here I am not informed of the fact, as ordered recently by you. Should the river close up with ice in our present situation the consequences would be fatal to our stock. Forage, particularly grain, should be sent here by steam power. Sea steamers laden with grain could tow sail crafts to this point. Our immediate necessities should be supplied in this manner. Generals Rucker on Van Vliet could have this done if so ordered.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Quartermaster.
