39th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Report of the Secretary of War.
Senate & Ho. of Reps;
to August 7, 640,806 troops had been mustered
out; August 22, 719,338; September 14,741,107;
October 15, 785,205; November 15, 800,063.
The command of Major General Sherman
(army of theTennessee and army of Georgia) and
the army of the Potomac were first to complete
their musters out entirely. Ilegiments com-
menced leaving General Sherman's command,
then numbering, present and absent, 116,183
officers and men, from the rendezvous near
Washington, on the 2'Jth of May, and on the
l|>t of August the last one of the regiments
mustered out left Louisville, Kentucky, to
which point the command (after the musters
out therefrom were partly completed,) was
transferred, and the armies composing it
merged into one, called the army of the 'Ten-
nessee. The work of mustering out the troops
was not continuous, it having been delayed by
the transfer of the two armies from this city
to Louisville and their subsequent consolida-
tion.
Regiments commenced leaving the army of
the Potomac (when numbering, including Nintli
corps, 162,851 officers and men, present and
absent) from the rendezvous near this city on
the 29th of May, and about six weeks thereafter
(July 19) the last regiment started for home.
During the interval the work, like that from
General Sherman's command, was not contin-
uous, it being interrupted and delayed by the
movement of the Sixth corps from Danville,
Virginia, to Washington and the consolidation,
by orders of June 28, of the remaining portion
of the army into a Provisional corps, number-
ing, present and absent, 22,699 ollicers and
men.
Thus, for the two commands in question, and
between the 29th of May and the 1st of August,
(two months,) 279,034 officers and men, present
and absent, were mustered out and placed en
rwde to their homes. Including other armies and
departments, the number was increased by
August 7 (two months and seven days) to
640,806 officers and men.
l-'rom the foregoing it will be seen that the
mass of the forccs discharged were mustered
out by September 14, or within two and a
half months from the time the movements of
troops homeward commenced. The average
per month during that time is 296,442.
By reference to the report of the officer in
charge of the bureau for the organization of
colored troops, it will be seen that the increase
in the number of these troops since his last
annual report is 49,509, of which 4,244 were
recruited in States in rebellion, and credited to
the loyal States, under the provisions of the act
of July 4, 1861. The whole number of colored
men enlisted into the service of the United
States during the rebellion was 178,975. The
largest number in service was on the 1 5th of
July, 1865, namely, 123,156. The loss during
the War from all causes, except muster out,
was 08,178. There have been 33,234 colored
troops mustered out. The number remaining
in service after existing orders for muster out
shall ha\ e been executed will be 85,024. The
number of applicants for commissions in col-
ored troops amounted to 9,019, of which 3,790
wev(e examined. Of this number 1,472 were
rejected, and 2,318 received appointments.
The number of soldiers discharged from regi-
ments, &e., of white troops to accept appoint-
ments in organizations of colored troops, was
1,767. Jt is ascertained, from the reports of
inspecting officers, that the morale of the organ-
ization is good.
PROVOST MARSHAL GENERAL.
On the 1st day of November, 1864, the date
to which the last annual report of the Provost
Marshal General was brought up, the business
of recruiting and the draft under the call of
July 18, 1864, was in progress:
The number called for wae 500,000
Reduced by credits on former calls 2b5,673
To be obtained 234,327
The whole number of voluntary enlistments
under that call was 188,172, namely:
"Volunteers, (white) .....146,392
Volunteers, (colored) 15,961
Regulars  6,339
Seamen 17,606
Marine corps  1,874
Total 188,172
The whole number of drafted men and
substitutes obtained under that call wa,s
54,797, namely: ^
Number held to personal service 26,205
Number of substitutes for drafted men 28,502
54,707
Number of substitutes for enrolled men...29,584
Total 84,291
Whole number obtained under the July call...272,463
On the 19th of December, 1864, a call was
made for 300,000 men.
Under, this call the whole number of volun-
tary enlistments was 157,058:
Volunteers, (white)  130,620
Volunteers, (colored)  10,055
Regulars  6,958
Seamen  9,106
Marine corps  319
Total  157,058
The whole number of drafted men and
substitutes under that call was 24,580:
Number held to personal serviec  12,566
Number of substitutes for drafted men... 12,014
24,580
Number of substitutes for enrolled men,. 12,997
Total  37.577
Whole number raised under December call
was   191,635
The suspension of active military operations
occurred while the business of the draft, under
this call, was in progress, and orders were is-
sued on the 13th of April. 1805, to discontinue
the business of recruiting and drafting; and on
the next day all drafted men who had not been
forwarded to general rendezvous were ordered
to be discharged, and soon after all who had
not been forwarded to thedeld were discharged
by orders through the Adjutant General.
The aggregate quotas charged against the several
States, under all calls made by the President of the
United States, trom the 15th day of April, 1861. to
the 14th day of April, 1865. at which time drafting
and recruiting ceased, were 2,759,019
The terms of service varying from three
months to three years, as shown in
detail by the books of the Provost
Marshal General's office.
The aggregate number of men credited on the
several calls, and put into sonico of the
United States in the Array, Navy, and Ma-
rine corps, during the above period, was 2,056,553
Leaving a deficiency on all calls, when the
war closed, of  102,-196
Which would have been obtained in full if
recruiting and drafting had not been discon-
tinued.
This number does not embrace the "emer-
gency men" put into service during the sum-
mer of 1863, by the States of New York, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania, nor those furnished
by the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,
during the "Morgan raid," amounting in all
to over 120,000 men, who served periods of
about two or three weeks.
In estimating the number of troops called
into service, it lias been the rule of the Depart-
ment to take into account the whole number
of men mustered, without regard to the fact
that the same persons may have been pre-
viously discharged, after having been accepted
and credited on previous calls.
Under the dilferent calls, volunteers have
been accepted for various terms of service,
namely, three, six, and nine months, and one,
two, and three years respectively; and a large
number of persons who had served under one
call have subsequently enlisted under another.
Thus a portion of those who enlisted under the
call, in April, 1861, for 75,000 three-months'
men, again enlisted under succeeding ca!l in
July following for three years; others reentered
the service for nine months, or for one or two
years, and at the expiration of these periods
again reenlisted for three years; and (he entire
"veteran volunteer" force consisted of those
who, having served two years, reenlisted" for
three years more.
It "will bo observed, therefore, that a large
portion of the number counted in filling" calls
has been furnished, first by the reenlistflientof
those in service, and, second, by those who
have reentered the service after a discharge
from a former enlistment under which they had
been credited; that is, the different calls were
filled by crediting each accepted enlistment, in-
stead of limiting the credit to the actual num-
ber of persons who entered the service anew;
and hence to determine the number of men
actually entering the service for the first time,
under the different calls, the number credited
should be reduced in the same ratio that the
enlistments of the same persons have been re-
peated. The extent of this reduction cannot
be calculated at this time, or even estimated
with sufficient accuracy to be useful.
It follows, therefore, that on account of a ne-
cessary repetition of credits, incident to enlist-
ments, the tax upon the military basis of the
country has been less than would appear by
considering simply the number of men em-
braced in the different calls for troops, or the
number of credits allowed upon these calls.
The amount of commutation money received
from November 1,1864, to November 1, 1805,
wasâ€”
On account of draft and substitute fund.. $317,130 00
On account of sick and wounded soldiers
(from non-eomWatantb, under section 17
of the act of February 21, 1S64)  340,987 53
Total    658,117 53
Tlielotai amount of4' draft and bubbtitute
fund'' received under the act approved
March 3,1365, is 825,902,029 00
The total amount expended  1(5,387,185 80
Balance remaining in Treasury to credit
of this fund  9,514,893 45
There are just claims still outstanding which
have to be met from this fund.
The regiments of the Veteran Reserve corps
have been performing garrison duty in Wash-
ington and its defensive works, at the various
depots for rccruits and drafted men, at the pro-
\ ost marshals' rendezvous, escorting recruits to
the field, and moie recently peifonning garri-
son duty at the several lendezvous for muster
out of the volunteer forces.
Since the termination of active operations
no transfers have been made to this corps, nor
have any officers been appointed.
The amount expended from the appropria-
tion for "collecting, drilling, and organizing
volunteers," from November 1, 1864, to Xo-
vemiier ], 1865, was ?1,422,281 73.
The balance of this appropriation remaining
in the Treasury is y;12,163,386 0'J, and about
half a million dollars is still in the hands of the
disbursing ollicers, which is needed to payout-
standing accounts and expenses incurred in
mustering out the volunteer forces of the Uni-
ted States.
As last as the exigencies of the service per-
mitted, the force employed has been reduced.
The surgeons and commissioners of boards of
enrollment in all the districts, 370 in number,
have been discharged. The different districts
have been consolidated, and but thirty-three
provost marshals are now in the service, all
of whom will 'ie discharged as soon as their
services can be lispensed with.
Xo appropria ion of money will be required
for the support of this bureau during the next
fiscal year.

vost Marshal General's Bureau will contain
