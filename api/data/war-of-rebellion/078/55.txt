WHITE'S STATION, May 27, 1864.

General WASHBURN:

The following from Major Yorke:

My scouts have not returned, except from Mount Pleasant. Chalmers is on or about Coldwater. It is reported that General Forrest had crossed the Tennessee River and captured Huntsville, Ala. The enemy in small parties are very trouble-some and daring. I am unable to capture them. As soon as my scouts from La Grange, the Pigeon Roost road, and the other side of the river return will send you word.

G. E. WARING, Jr.,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

WHITE'S STATION, May 27, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

The following from Major Yorke: There is a regiment of rebel cavalry, about 500 strong, encamped six miles southeast of Macon. There are two regiments at Corinth. He thinks the Macon force could be captured by sending across to-night, but I have only a small ferry-boat, and the distance is twenty-five miles.

G. E. WARING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

MEMPHIS, TENN., May 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. WARING, Jr., White's Station:

If you are satisfied as to the truth of the reports of the enemy being in force south of Coldwater and north of Wolf, Major Yorke had best be drawn in to Germantown. Scout north of Wolf not yet returned.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

MEMPHIS, TENN., May 29, 1864.

Colonel G. E. WARING, Jr.,

Commanding First Brigade, White's Station:

Your inspection reports show that your horses are fast running down. You will concentrate your entire command at White's Station, and you will send out no expeditions, except small patrols of twenty-five men each, until you receive orders from these headquarters.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

WHITE'S STATION, May 29, 1864.

Brigadier-General GRIERSON and

General WASHBURN:

The following from Major Yorke:

A man from Pocahontas reported that General Forrest on Tuesday was at Corinth, with his cavalry and a force of about 8,000 infantry, and was conscripting everything that could be called man. They report the railroad completed by Chewalla, and that enemy say in about a week it will be finished to Pocahontas. I sent a negro to you this morning who used to be with Forrest; he says he saw a part of the forces pass up to Corinth. The patrol I sent to Mount Pleasant at 3 a. m. has not been heard from yet.

GEO. E. WARING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
