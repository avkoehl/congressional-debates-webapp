its adoption; that there is no satisfactory evidence
to susiam the charge made by Henry Jones against
the Hon John Rugóles, and that it is inexpedient
for the Senate to entertain any further proceedings
on the subject
Mr W moved that the report and documents
be punted, which was ordered
Mr GRUNDY said that although this matter
was confined to a single individual, yet in his opi-
nion, it was matter of public concern, and as the
public would necessarily feel a mme than usual in-
terest in the case, he would move to prmt five hun-
dred extra copies
Mr WHITE made some explanatory íemarks,
which could not be distinctlj heard.
Mr KING opposed the printing, on the ground
of us being a private affair, and therefore unneces-
sary, besides which, the report being short, would
sood find its way into all the newspapers, of the
day
Mr GRUNDY said that so fir as he was con-
cerned, he had the fullest confidence in the com-
mittee, and was perfectly satisfied with the correct-
ness ot that report, but there might be others who
preferred to draw their ow n conclusions irom the
evidence, and hence it would be as well to give
thein an opportunity of indulging their wishes
Again, it was probable that the whole State which
the subject of that report represented m part, might
feel a deep interest m the subject, he therefore
hoped the motion to print would prevail The
question on printing being taken, was adopted
Mr NICHOLAS, from the Committee on Roads
and Canals, to which had been referie1 the bill

price of the public lands.
Mr HUBBARD moved to strtke out the follow-
ing And all lands which shall ha\ e been so offered
for fifteen years, shall be subject to entry at one

after that time, the same shall be subject to entry

lar per acre foi the space of one year for lands
which shall have been in the market ten years
prior to the 30lh September, IQ38 and after that
time the minimum is to be 75 cents per acie
Mr TIPTON hoped the amendment would not
prevail If it did, he should care vers 1 ttle about
the bill, as the State in which he lived «as inte-
rested in the provision proposed to be stricken out
more than any otbei
Mr HUBBARD suggested to the Senator from
Indiana,that the piovision which he wished to have
stricken out, would have no opeiative effect for
two years If it was stricken out he would vote
for the bill, but if n< t, as much as he was m favor
of the principle of reduction, he must vote agamn it
Mr TIPTON said he should like to have the
gentleman's vo*e, but was unwilling to pay so dear
for it
The question was then taken on Mr HUB-
BARD'S motion, and it was agreed to
The question recurring on the engrossment of
the bill, Messrs WALKER and BENTON seve-
rally addressed the Senate at length m its favor,
