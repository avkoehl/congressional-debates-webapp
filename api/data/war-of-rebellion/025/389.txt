General SULLIVAN:

If that command works south inform me. Roddey's whole force is 10 miles east of me and on the move; it may be that the two intend to make a junction. My cavalry are all out east toward the river; am inclined to think they will be able to drive Roddey back.

BETHEL, December 6, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

I have to-day heard from Savannah and 20 miles above on the Tennessee. My scouts are also down nearly to Clifton; no movement of the enemy reaches me from these directions. Two scouts came in from Yellow Creek above Hamburg. No enemy there or in that direction. Maxwell also reports same from Savannah. This evening I heard from Pocahontas; nothing there. Can be ready to move in thirty minutes, and will await your orders at any hour to-night.
