CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Ill
duty, be justly open to any constitutional objection,
it is not deemed appropriate on this occasion to
discuss. From these various considerauon ihe fol-
lowing deductions are made.
That the present tariff law  should be as little
disturbed by any revision as possible, consistent
with the public wants, and an adherence to "ound
principles that changes should be made chiefly, if
not solely, for puiposes of revenue, that these
changes, when rai-ing the duty, whether operating
before or after July 1, 1842, should, as a general
rule, be confined to articles not paying a duty as
high as twenty percent; that except m extreme
cases, it should never raise them above that rate,
and, lastly, that the existing provisions for the pay-
ment of duties in cash, and the assessment of thtm
on the value of the merchandise at the port of entry
after 1842, are too important to be disregarded
A principle deemed useful in carrying out these
views, is this   In raising the sum needed, if it does
not become nece sary to subject all free articles to
a duty, or to one as high as twenty per cent   and a
discrimination can therefore be indulged within the
restrictions of the compromise act, it is doubtless a
sound axiom to select for highest taxation articl s
of luxury, rather than of necessity    Under sunilai
circumstances it is, also, not only competent, but
expedient, to select such of the foimer as compete
most with similar articles of American growth or
manufacture, though not to raise the duty on ih'm
above the limitation of twenty per  cent    And
another discrimination, sometimes useful, might be
to select those articles, in certain cases, for an in-
creased impost, not usually exceeding  the   same
limitation,   which   may   be   proper   for   coun-
tervailing   injurious   imposts,   placed   on    our
own  productions by   any  foreign   power.   The
broad and well  settled ground   on which   these
distinctions  rest,   cannot   require   on   this   oc^
casion much detailed illustration.   For the luxu-
ries of life are enjoyed by the few,   rather than
the many—the rich instead of the poor—and then
use tends rather to effeminancy and pleasure, than
to what invigorates or makes useful    In a form of
Government like ours,these principles apply wuh pe
culiar force, as an excessive indulge nee in luxuries
always operate as a bane to republican manners,and,
m time ,to republican principles.  On the contrary,
articles of universal use, and considered «is the
necessaries of Ufe, are beneficial to all, and are to
be cheapened as much  as possible  to promote the
comforts of all     So what is American, may well
be supposed entitled to receive, withm the limi-
tations s'ipulated, more incidental favor than what
u foreign, because obtained with more readiness and
certainty as well as being more safe and independent
in its use      Nor can any other country complain
with justice, if we counteract its high taxation on any
of our products, by imposing some corresponding
impost on theirs, and however unprofitable such
conflicts usually prove to all concerned, yet when
such a measure becomes convenient for our own
fiscal purposes, or is required by proper self respect,
and is kept withm due restrictions as to the amount
of duty, it is believed to be entirely justifiab e
The present tariff is, in many of these respects, an
anomaly.   Being designed to get rid of revenue
when it was too abundant, and to dimmish a sup-
posed protection to manufactures, deemed unrea-
sonably high, as well as to establish certain general
rules for keeping all duties lower in future, it some-
times omitted lo make useful discriminations, and,
as a system, does not sufficiently discountenance
luxuries or favor the necessaries of life    Indeed,
the former have already become free in many cases,
and m others will be taxed lightly, under the. reduc-
tion now m progress, while the latter, though at the
expense of the consumer, however poor, will m al-
most every instance, bear as high, if not higher
burden, than the greatest superfluity. In proposing
a plan to raise the sum desired, one cardinal object
is, therefore, to obtain the money in a manner that
shall not pro'ong any impropne'ies or incongruities
in principle and anotheris, to do it,  nd slill preserve
faithfully the limitations and stipulations of the com-
promise as before explained.   To furnish some data
for practical legislation,which may accomplish these
designs harmoniously, two tabular statements have
been prepared, which will next be briefly explained.
The first one gives the names and value of all free
articles imponed into the United States m A D
1838, after deducting °uch of them as were ex-
ported (See A ) Taking the imports of that year
as a guide, and perhaps nearer an average, for some
time to come, than any other, though probably too
low, and the value of all the free articles, (exclud-
ing, of course, specie, and the amount of others
re-expoited,) would be about §38,161,583 A duly
on these,indiscriminately, of lifteen percent, would
yie'd a nett revenue not far from the five millions
that may be needed in 1842 But this would em-
biace several articles which, under the principles
before suggested, might judiciously be left free, or
at a lower rate of duty than fiftetn per cent
Another mode of raising the same;} amount of
revenue, would, therefore, be preferable, if it
could be accomplished without including those
articles Suppose, then, that ihere should be
selected fiom the free articles those which may
be regarded most as luxuries, though not, in
every respect, belonging exclusively to that cla's
Such are teas, coffee, and si'ks Should we then
add to them others, conflicting with similar Ame-
rican productions, such as wor te 's, liaens, &c and
the aggregate, deducting the amount re exporled,
would be $29,026 448 (?ee the second table, B )
A duty cf twenty per cent, on those, after paying
the expenses of collection, would yield about the
same amount of five millions Th's seems to con
tain the general data for the most eligible and un-
exceptionable revision If a less sum than five
millions should prove to be needed, as it is pre-
sumed will be the case under the diminished expen-
ditures and increased importations, anticipated and
explained in the recent annual report on the
finances, as well as irom the further augmentation
of revenue likely to happen from the new mode of
assessing the v.tlue of merchandise, any suitable
modifications can be made m these deiails, wiihout
departing from the prmcip'es believed to be the
mos' appiopnate to govern the subject.
So some articles of luxury not now flee, but pay-
ing a less duty than fitteen or twenty per cent
might very properly be taxed to that extenl, and
some necessaries of life so situated, might be made
free cr be taxed lower, instead of them Among
the former may be mentioned wine?, though when
any of them cannot at present be mj.de to pay an
additional duty without vio'atmg some tieaty st
pulation, they should, of course, be exempted
during the period agreed upon Where any am-
eles appear, Also, to require an increased impost
mere'y as a countei vailing measure, vueh an oí e
could be imposed wi'hout materially chpngmg the
general result as to revenue, if the increase was not
made otherwise exceptionable, by exceeding the limi-
tations in the compromise. Nor will difficulty pro-
bably etist, in any event, in permitting what is so
very desirable, that some of the artic'es of necessi-
ty, which, by the present laws, will, after 1842,
still pay a duty of 20 per cent should be then ex-
empted from all, or a part of it. But whatever
plan may,m the end, be approved, it is apprehend-
ed that encugh rus been stated to explam the de-
tails of the one now offered, as well as the limita-
tions and pnnc pie  wh ch ought, m the opinion of
the undersigned, to govern all legislation on the
subject. Nothing further will, therefore, be added
as to any measure to be adopted for relief in 1842,
except that half the amount of increased duty should
be made to accrue only from the 1st of January
m that jear, and the residue commence the 1st of
July after, as those are the periodo when ihe great
future reductions begin, which the new duties are
intended to supply.
In Conner Hon with a permanent revision of the
tariff, if made in the manner here recommended, it
would be proper, undei a plan of cash duties for
all imports, to enlarge the liberty now enjoj ed for
depositing goods tor a time in public stor s. In
deed, the warehousing system, which exists in ome
ether countries, might, in that event, be usefully
revised, and, so far as the new circumstances re-
quired, be adopted here
As the higher class of dudes, which existunder the
present laws, will be reduced in 1842, so as v rm-
ally not to exceed an impost of twenty per cent on
the value of the merchandise impoited, it might
also be expedient to provide for the assessment ojf
the whole ot them afterwards on the ad vvkretíi
principle. At the same time, if not done previously,
some of the laige drawbacks and bounties, now
allowed, could be regulated with more justice, and
with much benefit to the íevenue, by reducing them
so as to correspond in their proportions with the
reduced duties
Some other particulars might be suggested in
connection with a general and permanent revision
of the tariff But they are Hot of such a character
as to occur readily to all familiar with the subject,
and atter the length to which this report has al-
ready extended, it is not deemed necessary to pro-
Ion it further, by an enumeration and explanation
of them
The other branch of the  resolution in respect to
the  new mode of valuing  the imports will be an-
sweied at the earliest day practicable.
