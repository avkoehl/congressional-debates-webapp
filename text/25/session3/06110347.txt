the law of the realm The friends of the free
principles of the English constitution were un-
able to make a stand against her power and ovei-
whelming influence It has been well rentalked
by the historian that she obtained a lease for life
of aibitrary power, and that if the foice of fiee
principles and free institutions were not destroyed,
they were suspended duung het íeign Her sue
cessors attempted to tiead in the footsteps of their
lllustnous predecessor, without the ability, en
ergy, or populanty to sustain the high ground of
royal prerogative occupied by Queen Elizabeth,
and, after her death, the fnends of fieedom tose
in all their strength, resisted the airogant and
tyrannical pretensions of succeeding monarchs,
and, after a long and bloody struggle, settled the
principles of Enlish liberty by the revolution of
1688
Geneial Jackson was elevated to the presiden-
tial chair by the gratitude and affections of the
American people for his heroic achievements
His military career, his energy and decision of
character, his admitted patnotism, his popular
depoitment, his professed devotion to the princi-
ples of the Constitution and the liberties of the
people, as he took the liberty to understand them,
gave him an ascendency over the public mind
which rendered íesistance to his administration
vain and fiuitless The affections and admua-
tion of the American people granted him a lease
for his term of service to act in a great degree
accotding to his own will Besides removing the
deposits, he exercised the veto power in a man-
ner and to an extent unexampled in our Govern-
ment, and beyond anything known in the history
of Great Britain in modem times Indeed, it
can hardly be presumed that «such an exertion of
the veto power by a British King would be toler-
ated oi submitted to, and the probable result
would be rebellion and civil war He oideied
the public money to be removed from the place
assigned by law, without the consent of Con-
gress, and deposited it in the hands of bank
agents created by State authority, and in no man-
ner responsible to this Government
I will not ad veit to other matters often presented
to the consideration of the people The present
Administration is pledged to maintain the prin-
ciples and measures of the last, and it is for the
good sense of the community to decide whether
they will adhere to the successor of General Jack-
son in support of the measures and the principles
to which I have adverted I was born in the Old
Dominion, and have ever been proud to claim it
as the land of my birth, until that State bowed in
submission to these usurpations of the Federal
Executive But I was still more moitified to hear
that this gieat Commonwealth had requned the
Senate of the nation, composed1 of the represent
atives of the States, to be degraded and humbled
in dust and ashes at the feet of the American
monaich, because they had dared to disapprove
his usuipations The enlightened friends of lib
erty throughout the world must be astounded at
the fact, that the people of Virginia, the birth
place of Washington, Hemy, Jeiferson, Mason,
Madison, and a host of otheis of republican
stamp, could look on with composuie at these
ouuages on the pnnciplesof our fiee system, and
in deiogation of poweis and puvileges confided
to the legislative body I will not, Mi Chair
man, despair of the Republic, but indulge a hope
that there must be a political regeneration in the
Old Dominion, and that we shall soon see on this
fiooi her sons animated with the spnit of Wash-
ington, Henry, and other friends to constitutional
libeity, ready to restore to Congress, and espe-
cially to this body, their control over the public
purse, and to lebuild the paitition wall reared by
the founders of out system, between executive
and legislative power I trust we shall soon h ive
a majority heie who will order the original man
date for the lemoval of the deposits to be brought
•to this House, and marked and branded with
public condemnation, or burnt like the Yazoo act
of Geoigii, by file fiom Heaven When this
solemn duty shall be peifoimed, I will then be
lleve this Republic still lives m substance, as it
came fiom the hands of our foitfuhois
Mr Chairman, the Piesident denounces corpo-
rations and associated wealth fauch slang might
be tolerated at cross loads oi gioceiy tiveins, but
I feel surprised and mortified to find such in a
State pajer emanating from the Chief Magistrate
of a gi eat nation It is not the language of a di 
nified statesman, but the slang of an electioneering
demagogue Whether Í agiee with a President
or not in his views, I can respect him as the fiist
officer of my Government, if his course is marked
by dignity and piopnety In this war on corpo
íations and associated wealth, he only imitates a
British tyiant, James I , oi one of the Charleses,
who, m the plenitude of his royal prerogative,
asserted the light to annul the charters of incor
poration in England I think he annulled one,
that of the city of London, and alarmed others
into a surrendei of their chaiters, and they ob
tamed new charters from his Majesty upon the
payment of a bonus He did not make war on
coi porations to secure the liberties or good of the
people, but to increase the power and patronage
of the Crown, and to fill the coffers of the King
Whether any higher motives influence those who
denounce corporations here, I leave to others to
determine What is meant by associated wealth
to create prejudice or odium, I do not understand
This slang either has no definite meaning, or is
the lowest soit of Locofocoism—intended, as I
imagine, to airay the pooi against the nch A
State, every political association or body-politic,
is a coipoiation, it is associated wealth, men
unite and form a State or body politic, to secuie
propelty as well as life and libeity, and for the
general happiness and prosperity An lneoipo
lated city or town is a body-politic, an as3ocia
Hon of wealth or pioperty, f>i the better security
of property, as well as life and bbeily, and eveiy
other blessing incident to the social stite Mill y
coi porations are composed of individuals with
small funds, who put small sums togethei to ac
complish some useful object, to which the suiplus
capital of no one individual is competent Budges,
roads, insuiance companies of eveiy kind, aie
formed m this way But I will not dtttin the
committee by details on this subject These coi
porations, formed by many individuals, cieate a
common interest, and are so many fixtuies in the
State, giving strength and stability to the whole
frame of human society
From the report of the Committee of Ways and
Means, drawn and presented by the chairman,
the organ to this House of the executive Admin
istration, we must infer that the Executive is
against a tariff to protect American industry,
against internal improvements of any kind, na
tional or local, including harbois He is against
the distnbution of the public land, or its proceeds,
among the States, he is for holding the proceeds
as a pait of the permanent annua] revenue With
regard to a piotective tariff nothing need now be
said, because that subject has been compromised
and settled until the yeai 1842 I do not under-
stand that any man, of any party, is for disturb
nig the question befoie that time With regard
to internal improvements, no discussion is necis
siry, because, with theexception of two or thiee
roads of a national charactei, and of great neces
sity and utility, which this Govei nment has com
menced, and seems to be bound in good faith to
complete, I am not aware that any public man is
uiging on Congress or the nation the policy of
engaging in a 3ystem of internal improvements
General Jackson conceded the powei to makeim
piovements of a national character, and Ibeheve
no person contends for more,and butfewforthat
much It may be necessaiy to make a few roads
with refeience to military operations or carrying
the mail I considei these questions of tariff and
internal improvements disposed of for the present
If my fi lend from Virginia [Mr Robertsov] will
read a pait of my speech on the bank question, in
1811, he will find that, although we may not agree
about a national bank, we aie neaier together
about the line of demarkation between Fedeialand
State poweis than he supposes I there contend
that this Government ought to avoid, as fai as
possible, any gencyin the mteuor of the Slates,
and leave to them all matteis of local concern,
confining this Government to matteis strictly na
tional
Ihe President, as I have before stated, con
tends foi a sub lieasuty to place the public mo-
ney under the contiol and in the keeping of the
Executive and officcis ho'ding at his pleasure,
and is opposed to a national bank to be made our
fiscal agent and directly responsible to Congress
I shall not at this penod discuss this subject at
large At the called session, I presented a prop-
osition for a national bank, reserving one third of
the stock to be divided among the Slates, and
precluding foreign stockholder from any control
or management of the institution, with other pro-
Visions, to be found in the proceedings of this
House Without discussion, that subject was
silenced by the previous question There never
has been a majouty m this Congress fot a national
bank, sub Tieasuiy, or the State bank agencv
I must ask leave, on this occasion, to say to the
conservative gentlemen that I cannot mdoise their
scheme of State banks, because I have no faith
in them, they will multiply and expand until
they explode again I may vote for them in pref-
erence to the sub Tieasury, but it will require
an effoit with myself to make a choice Gentle-
men talk much of the dangei of one bank mon-
ster which has proved useful and safe,and s ood
the test for yeais Now, sir, a many headed
monster of Slate banks is moie frightful to me
than one     We are called on to appoint at least
1 twenty six bank agents, undei the auihonly of
the twenty six Slates, not under the control of
this Government, or responsible to keep the pub-
[ lie money     In the city of New Yoilc half our
■ levenue is collected and suppose twelve oi fificcn
millions of the national levenue deposited in the
New Yoik binks, and that gieat State was to
anay hcistlf against the laws and authonty of
this Government, and renew the scenes of nulli-
fication, till their banks to withhold the levenue,
ind give them a pledge of indemnity—what, su ,
would be our condition, and how could the funds
be retched when perhaps most wanted ' I beseech
gentlemen to weigh this matter like statesmen,
and not sacrifice their country to piescrve their
consistency in enor Every candid man must
peicetvc at once that if bank agency is necessary
I and propei foi this Government, it must have the
power, and ought to exercise it, to create a sound,
safe, and responsible bank agent, with blanches
in eveiy State to receive and pay out the public
' funds, according to the directions of Congiess
ThisGovernment, with regard to caidinal powers
cleaily and distinctly gianted, ought to be inde-
pendent in its action of any other authonty, and
the public puise should be dtvoiced fiom the con-
tiol of executive, judiciary, and eveiy authonty,
except the repiesentatives of the people m Con
gress This is the gieat principle for which I
contend, and the leading question now befoie the
American people
I repeat, that I have a mortal aversion to this
many headed monster, the Slate banks, and, if I
should vote foi any such pi eject, it will be for no
othei purpose than to defeat another measure, the
sub Treasuiy, the leading objtct of which is to
place the puolic pui->c moic dnectly und r Exec-
utivi dneetion Thete is but one right course
about anything, the couise maiked out by the
wise and enlightened statesmen and patuots who
have gone beloic us—and that is in iclation to
om fiscal agent, a national banl , and their wis-
dom has been foitificd by the experience of forty
years Every other experiment hiis failed, \v lth
great loss and mjuiy to the countiy,and vet gen-
tlemen insist that they must be consistent f he
moie I reflect on this State bank system, m con-
nection wnh this Government, the moie I dislike
it It has a tendency to bi ing the moneyi d mtei-
est and institutions of the Sutes m contact, and
undei the influence of this Government Pievi-
ous to the year 181], when the charter of the fust
bank expired, our monetary system was safe and
sound, the banking system had been generuly
honestly and prudently conducted, and no íedun
dant or spunouspapei cunency had cu sed this
people Manj enlightened anddisntciested men
of the Republican paity assuuii me at tha tine
that no bank in U e woild had been bettet m in
aged than tne bank created with the s ine i< n of
Piesident Washington, the charter of which vjas
then about to c^pne It was geneially believed
for some time befoie that ppnod t at the Glutei
