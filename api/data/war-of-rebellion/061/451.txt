of infantry advancing in line. About 1 p. m. we had advance 5 miles from our camp of the night previous, and were distant 4 or 5 miles from Mansfield, when a heavy force of the enemy appeared in our front and on our right flank. At about this time general Ransom appeared on the ground with the Second Brigade of the Fourth Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, to relieve the First Brigade from its duty with the cavalry advance. Immediately in our front was a large clearing on the slope of a hill, over which was the course of the road. But little resistance was offered to our advance to the crest of this hill, and we were soon in position. Two regiments of the Fourth Brigade Cavalry, Colonel Dudley commanding, the Third and Sixth Massachusetts Cavalry,* were placed on the left flank, deployed in the woods. The First [Second] New Hampshire Cavalry, of the same brigade, was deployed on the right flank. The Second Illinois Cavalry formed a half mile in rear of the first lines. Nims' on the crest of the hill in and to the right and left of the road. A section of the Sixth Missouri Howitzer Battery was placed on the left of Nims'. A brigade of infantry was place din the front, one regiment to the left of Nims' battery, the others to the right. A second brigade of infantry was placed on our right flank, facing the enemy, who appeared in that direction. The First Brigade Cavalry, Colonel T. J. Licas commanding, was place don the extreme right of the line and fought dismounted. With this brigade was a section of the Sight missouri Howitzer Battery. The Third Cavalry Brigade was in rear, escorting the train of the division, which was moving behind.

Meanwhile, and shortly after occupying the ground, the major-general commanding had, with his staff, arrived upon the field and assumed the general direction of affairs. Brigadier-General Stone, chief of staff, had ridden with the advance since an early hour in the morning.

The above dispositions being made, our force was stationery for about two hours, slight skirmishing, however, continuing on the flanks. The enemy meanwhile could be observed to shift the position of strong columns, using for such purpose roads crossing the Mansfield road and passed not distant from our right. About 4 p. m. he made a general advance all along our lines in strong force, and though an obstinate resistance was made, our lines were forced back to the wood at the foot of the hill. In the attack on the front Nims' battery did most excellent serve, repelling three successive charges of the enemy. Twenty minutes after the action opened the battery was ordered to retire, the infantry support having already given way in confusion. Three pieces were taken to the rear in good order; three pieces were left on the field, it being impossible to remove them, the horses being disabled. The section of Sixth Missouri Howitzer Battery retired in good order. The First Brigade meanwhile was doing splendid service as infantry on the right flank, being the last to retire. A section of Battery G, Fifth U. S. Artillery, Lieutenant Rawles commanding, had been place din position on the right flank and acted with the First Brigade; also a section of the Sixth Missouri Howitzer Battery.
