Cist, assistant adjutant-general of volunteers, at these headquarters, to duty as assistant adjutant-general, with the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel, and for his promotion by brevet to the grade of colonel. This application is based on the past services of Major Cist, who has been on duty in the assistant adjutant-general's office at my headquarters for three years, and brings to bear on his knowledge of the duties of his position energy and faithfulness in their performance. I would recommend his promotion by brevet as a just recognition of his services during this period in the capacity he has been serving.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,
