War Dkpabtment,
Paymaster General's Office,
Washington, D. C., January, 1872.
Sir: I have the honor to submit thofollowing
estimate of the approximate cost of effecting an
equalization of bounties at this time, based upon
the provisions of House bills Nos. 89 and 240, as
requested by the Milita-ry Committee of the House
of Representatives under date of December 19,1871.
Under the provisions of Hon. Mr* Niblack's bill,
No. 89, the approximate cost of equalization is
$137,275,105 94, determined as follows:
1. Number of enlisted men of the regular Army
who enlisted at any time between April 12,1801,
and April 19,1865. and who served faithfully and
were honorably discharged, was 46,379
Average duration of service will approximate 29
months.
2. Number of enlisted men of all classes of volun-
teers, including those recognized for completing
defenses of Washington and slaves who enlisted or
were drafted between April 12,1861, and April 19,
1865, who served faithfully and were honorably
discharged, was 2,234,421
Deduct substitutes     123,190

3. Add number enlisted for not less than three
years, and discharged on account of wounds, or
while engaged in tho lino of duty, (extra tiino not
included in No. 2 above,) was .....59,500
Average time of actual service to bo credited was
36 monthsâ€”28.7=7,3 months.
Tho above, taken sovcrally at their average dura-
tion of sorvice in months, would give as follows:
1. $8 33^X29, monthsX 46,379 men = $11,20S,258 33
2. 8 33jX28.7 monthsX2,109,639 men = 50-4,555,327 50
y. 8 33SX 7.3 monthsX 59.500 men = 3,619,5S3 33

and payable under existing laws
by tho United States, namely:

Hon. John Cobitrn", Chairman Committee on Military

Statement showing the number of officers and sol-
diers (regulars and volunteers) of the United States
Army, during tho rebellion of 1861-65, who entered
the service for periods varying from three months to
threo years, together with the estimated cost to the
Government should certain provisions of House bill
No. 506, (second session Forty-Second Congress,)
become law; furnished for tho information of Hon.
JonN CoiiUEX, chairman Committee on Military
Affairs, in compliance with his request, dated Janu-
ary 5, 1872.
Tho number of officers and soldiers was 2,568,556
They are accounted for as follows:
Deaths..    327,184
Desertions  278,644
Dishonorably discharged  2,693
Dismissed or cashiered  2,697
Honorably discharged 1,957,338
Total 2,568,55G
In determining: the soveral classes of enlisted men
above, all unreturnad and unpardoned deserters,
all men dishonorabiydifcharged, and all discharged
for favor and for minority, as provided in the bill,
have been excluded.
But in the credits of enlisted men,of volunteersm
To furnish certificates of indebtedness of $160each,
with interest at the ratoof fivo per cent, per annum,
redeemable in five years, to 1,957,338 honorably dis-
charged officers and soldiers of the Army, as pro-
vided in section five of the bill, would cost 8391,467,-
C00; and if in addition thereto tho same benefits be
extended to the heirs of 327,184 officers and soldiers
who died in the service, tho amountwould be there-
by increased $65,436,800, making an aggregate of
$456,904,400.
Tho office has no data as to the number of seamen,
marines, See., who nerved in tho Navy or in tho
Marino corps during the rebollion, consequently
the information desired in their cases cannot bo
furnished.
Tho number of wagon-masters and teamsters em-
ployed during tho war has ncvor been compiled, and
it is estimated that the preparation of such a state-
ment would involve the labor of twelve clerks for a
period of two years.
Itespectfully submitted to tho Secretary of War.
E. D. TOWNSENi).
Adjutant General.
Mr. KELLOGG. It is conceded on all
sides if my amendment shall be adopted it
will provide only for a few cases of hardship
where they were enlisted before the 22d of
July and come within the scope of the decis-
ions, but owing to tho fault of the mustcring-
oflieors in not sending in their reports they
wore not mustered in before that time.
Mr. Keli.org's amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask my colleague to
yield to me to move an amendment for the
purpose of equalizing the bounties of all sol-
diers who enlisted and served during the war.
Mr. COBURN. I cannot yield for that
purpose. It would be unfair to take up this
question now and in this way; let it come in
its own time.
Mr. HOLMAN. There are a number of
soldiers who enlisted and served in the Army,
and who were honorably discharged, who ought
to be allowed bounty equal to that which has
been granted to others. I submit that to give
them a bounty of perhaps fifty, dollars would
be reasonable. It would so completely do jus-
tice that there would never hereafter be a
ground of complaint, I think the country ex-
pects such action on our part during the pres-
ent Congress. I hope the gentleman will allow
me to submit the question to the House.
Mr. COB URN. It would not be treating
the House or the committee, or any one who
has had this matter under consideration, fairly,
to submit such a proposition for action at this
timfe. Let these matters come up in regular
order. They are all under consideration by
the committee, and will in due lime be bi'ought
before the House. I decline to yield for the
amendment, and demand the previous ques-
tion on the engrossment and third reading of
the bill as amended.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill, as amended, was ordered
to be engrossed for a third reading ; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. COBURN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid oe the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
SALE OF ARSENALS, ETC.
Mr. SLOCUM. A bill, which was errone-
ously printed, was referred to the Committee
on Military Affairs on Friday. I now report
the bill from the committee in correct form,
and ask that it be printed and recommitted.
The bill (H. R. No. 18G3) authorizing the
sale of certain arsenals and other property of
the United States was received, read a first
and second time, recommitted to the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs, and ordered to be
printed.
JOHN E. WOODWARD.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, from the
Committee on tho Judiciary, reported back,
with a recommendation that it do pass, the
bill (H. R. No. 1424) to reimburse John E.
Woodward for certain moneys paid by him.
The bill was read. It provides that the sum
of $3,629 72 be paid from the judiciary fund
accruing from fines, penalties, and forfeit-
ures, to John E. Woodward, the same being
the amount of money paid by him as dam-
ages, interest, and cost on a judgment in favor
of Samuel Fells, in the circuit court of Mc-
Cracken county, State of Kentucky, because
of the sale by said Woodward of certain prop-
erty during the war by the order of the Pres-
ident of the United Slates, the proceeds of
said sale having been duly and faithfully
accounted for to the United States.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. This bill
was agreed to unanimously and reported by
the Committee on the Judiciary of the last
House, and failed for want of time. It is now
agreed to unanimously by the Judiciary Com-
mittee of this House.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask that the bill be again
reported.
The bill was again read.
Mr. IIOLMAN. If there is a report accom-
panying this bill I should like to hear it read.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. There is
no report, but the records and affidavits and
all the evidence accompany it.
I have already stated that this was unani-
mously passed by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee of last Congress, and that it has been
considered and unanimously reported by the
Judiciary Committee of the present House.
The statement is a very simple one. Mr.
Woodward was an officer in the Army. He
was ordered by the President to sell certain
property. He did so, and accounted for the
money, and it was paid into the Treasury.
After the war a suit was brought against him
by the owner of the property, who claimed
that the order of the President was not a suf-
ficient justification, and recovered the sum
mentioned in this bill, which Woodward had
to pay. The proceeds have gone into the
Treasury.
Mr. HOLMAN. There are several prece-
dents for that.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; andbeing engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, moved to
reconsider the vote by which the bill was
passed; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
JUDICIAL SYSTISM OE THE UNITED STATES.
Mr. PETERS, from the Committee on the
Judiciary, reported a bill (H. R. No. 1864) to
extend the provisions of the act of April 10,
18G9, entitled " An act to amend the judicial
system of the United States which was read
a firs*- and second time.
