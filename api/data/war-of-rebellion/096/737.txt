 Harper's Ferry, W. Va., February 28, 1865.

Information has been received that a raid will probably be made on Martinsburg some time this week. An attempt may be made to cut the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and telegraph at the same time. Especial vigilance must be used on the part of all officers to keep the commands, pickets, and patrols on the alert. Any information that may be obtained should be reported to these headquarters or at Martinsburg with as little delay as possible. Until further orders no citizen, unless positively known to be loyal, will be allowed to enter the trains at any point between Hancock and Martinsburg, and Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry.

By order of Brigadier-General Seward.
