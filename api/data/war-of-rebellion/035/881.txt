HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, June 19, 1863.

Major-General BUCKNER,Commanding, &amp;c., Knoxville:

The Fifty-first Virginia Regiment ordered to report to you without delay at Knoxville. If you can take care of the Salt-Works, Sixty-third Virginia Regiment can go to you from Saltville. I think it probable, however, that the enemy has a cavalry force in readiness to pounce on the Salt-Works as soon as the troops are withdrawn from there. I have a field battery at Gable Spring at your service, if you need it. Answer.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, June 19, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

The enemy made a demonstration in force against Big Creek Gap night before last, but retired after heavy skirmishing. He now threatens Cumberland Gap and Loundon, telegraphic communication to which point is already interrupted. This morning at 5 o'clock 2,000 cavalry were near Loudon. The bridges along the railroad and the mountain gap are guarded by garrisons deemed strong enough to prevent surprise, while General Buckner, who left here this morning, is concentrating his forces near Clinton.

A raid on Knoxville is not improbable. Proper measures for the protection of the place are being taken.

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.

KNOXVILLE, June 19, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Major-General Buckner is at Clinton, concentrating his forces. Enemy, 2,000 strong, attempted to burn the railroad bridge yesterday, but failed. Attempted to burn depots here last night, but failed again, and retired this morning, after severe cannonading, in the direction of Rogersville.
