General Birney will march this evening. There is no change in front of Rappahannock, or as far as we have scouted to the left. General Pleasonton reports a cavalry force at Amissville, where it has been for two weeks. General Pleasonton has a cavalry brigade at Warrenton and one at Thoroughfare Gap. The indications are, therefore, that the enemy have gone up the Valley. The trains I have ordered to be turned off at Catlett's, to go by Wolf Run Shoals. Have you anything from the Valley to indicate where the enemy is to-day?

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

General SEDGWICK:

Signal officer at Phillips' house reports a considerable force of the enemy in the vicinity of Fredericksburg. Four or five regiments are camped along the river, from the Taylor house to the Goss house. Quite a force at the dam, and a force on the plain in rear of town. Five batteries just went over the heights from your crossing, and a number of guns are in position on the plain still. A regiment is now engaged apparently in establishing pickets along the river line from Fredericksburg to Falmouth.

DUMFRIES, June 14, 1863-6. 45 p. m.

General REYNOLDS:

What trains, and by what roads on the McDowell map, did your order by Wolf Run Shoals? Can they not cross at Spriggs' Ford? We are moving by Wolf Run Shoals, and they will interfere. Answer, and say where we telegraph you to-night. Reported that Ewell's corps is in front of Winchester. This is all we know of him. One corps had better halt at Manassas until trains cross Occoquan.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
