STRAWBERRY PLAINS, August 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General TILLSON:

GENERAL: Colonel Trowbridge with 13 commissioned officers and 263 enlisted men and a few scouts left promptly at 6 o'clock this morning. I gave Colonel Trowbridge full and explicit instructions in writing in conformity with explanations from Colonel Crawford, as you directed they will do the work thoroughly. My adjutant will bring the monthly report on the train to-day in order if required to correct the same in compliance with recent instructions from you.

T. FOOTE,

Colonel, &amp;c.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

What must I do with men arrested-aiders and guerrillas? I have many. Must they go to South America or the Tortugas? Have some conspirators in the Sons of Liberty. May I send them to the Tortugas? It is no use to try them; we must imprison or send them off.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 1, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE,

Louisville:

To send prisoners to the Dry Tortugas you must have the consent of the Secretary of War. No doubt he will promptly grant it. I fully approve your course and want you to make it thorough, and clean out Kentucky of all suspicious men.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

NEAR ATLANTA, August 1, 1864

Major-General WASHBURN,

Memphis:

General Stephen D. Lee has arrived in Atlanta and brought with him 3,500 dismounted cavalry. If you have force enough to defend Memphis, Smith should move to Decatur, Ala., where he can be supplied, and from which point he can watch Forrest. Roads are now good, and the growing corn about Rienzi and Tuscumbia will feed his stock. I may have to draw somewhat more than is prudent from Decatur. If Forrest's movements look to Tennessee, this movement should be rapid. If the Tennessee River be in good boating order he will find a gun-boat at Eastport.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
