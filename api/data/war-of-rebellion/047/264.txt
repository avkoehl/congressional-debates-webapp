Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: Colonel Waddy has been instructed to send two rifled and banded 42-pounder siege guns to James Island, to be mounted at either Battery Haskell or Ryan, as Colonel Gonzales may determine.

James Island being much in need of troops, the general directs that the order he rescined for the two regiments, and General Taliaferro to be held in readiness for Savannah, and suggests that an additional regiment be sent there temporarily from Sullivan's Island.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLIFTON H. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., August 7, 1863.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Commanding, James Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: Your communication of the 4th instant, containing report of the reconnaissance of James Island made with General Hagood, has been received, and I am instructed to communicate the following indorsement of the commanding general upon the same, for your information:

The present defensive lines on James Island are so defensive that it would not be judicious to expend much time and labor upon them. Hence Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, chief engineer, has been instructed to commence, as soon as practicable, a new defensive line of four redans or redoubts (one-half to three-quarters of a mile apart) from Secessionville to Dill's residence on the Stono; the first work for three guns, the second for four guns, the third (one Stono) for six guns, and the fourth, also on Stono, for four guns, their armament to come from the present lines, and such guns as can be spared from Sumter or other forts.

These new works will be made as soon as practicable into detached redoubts, connected together with cremaillere lines. The lower work on the Stono should be heavily armed, and the navigation of the river must be obstructed with a large quantity of torpedoes, from a half to one and a half miles below the fort.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLIFTON H. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Copies to Brigadier General R. S. Ripley, commanding First Military District South Carolina, and Lieutenant Colonel D. B. Harris, chief engineer.)
