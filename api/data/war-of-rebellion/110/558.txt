SAVANNAH, GA., November 1, 1863.

General B. BRAGG,

Mission Ridge, Tenn.:

Your telegram of the 31st received. The result is a bitter disappointment, as my expectations were sanguine that the enemy, by throwing across the Tennessee his force at Bridgeport, had insured the success of the operations suggested by General Longstreet and confided to his execution. Such disobedience of orders and disastrous failure as you describe cannot consistently be overlooked. I suppose you have received the explanation due to the Government, and I shall be pleased if one satisfactory has been given.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
