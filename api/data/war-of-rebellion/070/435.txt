Secretary of War:

SIR: Before the publication of your dispatch of this morning the most intense anxiety prevailed. Gold went up to 176 1\2. On its publication, about 1 o'clock, gold went down in fifteen minutes to 170 1\2. There is but one expression of opinion among loyal people here respecting the General Dix dispatches, viz, gratitude for them and unlimited confidence in their contents.

Very respectfully,

E. S. SANFORD,

Major-General.
