General TURNER,

Department Headquarters:

The enemy have driven in our pickets on the Darbytown road and are moving down it in column. Please send a battery and brigade from Heckman's command down the Kingsland road to Jourdan.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Lieutenant SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: Major Randlett, commanding picket-line of the right brigade, reports that the right of his line is about 250 yards from the Charles City road. The enemy's works extend to that road. The captain of the cavalry company, which is on my right, reports that he is on Charles City road, and that the enemy have a battery in the road. He does not state whether this battery is behind works or not. I have sent for more definite information. If the distance from the right of my skirmish line from the Charles City road is not greater than 250 yards, as reported by Major Randlett, I shall soon have my line extended to it, as I have already sent a regiment for that purpose. I have just received intelligence that the guns above referred to are behind hastily constructed works.

Very respectfully,

A. AMES,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: Colonels Plaisted and Voris report that the enemy's line is quite strong and with considerable force behind them, as has already been reported to-day. It has been reported by an officer on the skirmish line that he saw re-enforcements coming on. This officer is the only one who makes this report. The sergeant of the cavalry company on my extreme right reports that sometime since he saw the Fifth Pennsylvania and Third New York Cavalry advancing slowly up the Charles City road, and that it was reported to him that the Eighteenth Corps was on their right. The sergeant estimates the time since he left the Charles City road as about one hour and a half.

Very respectfully,

A. AMES,

Brigadier-General.
