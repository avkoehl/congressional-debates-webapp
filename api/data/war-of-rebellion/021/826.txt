JNO. WITHERS,Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SUB-MILITARY DISTRICT OF HOUSTON,

Houston, Tex., October 13, 1862-10 a. m.

Captain SAMUEL BOYER DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, &amp;c., San Antonio, Tex.:

Your dispatches through Captain Mason, have been received. I hope that my reports will satisfy the general commanding that his views have been so far carried into execution. I must defer issuing the order for the court of inquiry concerning the evacuation of Sabine Pass. Colonel Cook and Major Menard cannot now be spared. The express from 10 miles to 10 miles to San Antonio will be organized at once. I have ordered one locomotive to be always in readiness here and one at Alleyton. I have done all I could for the protection of the Nechez, Sabine, Trinity, and San Jacinto. The lesser streams are attended to. I regret to say that the guns at Fort Point and at the southern battery on Galveston Island had been spiked before I knees anything of it. Please find herewith a telegram just received from Colonel Cook. I send the 10-inch columbiad to Fort Hebert. Colonel Cook says he can use it. May I not be below the task. All the zeal and energy can do shall be done.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

X. B. DEBRAY,

Colonel, Commanding Sub-Military District of Houston.

VIRGINIA POINT, TEX., October 13, 1862.

Col. X. B. DEBRAY:

COLONEL: All quiet. Two of the enemy's vessels left the harbor this morning-one steamer, one sailing vessel. My scouts bring me word from several citizens of the city that Captain Renshaw had informed them that he would destroy the bridge this week, and that he had sent for Wilson's Zouaves to hold the city. Will you send the 10-inch columbiad?

Respectfully, &c.,

JOS. J. COOK,

Colonel.
