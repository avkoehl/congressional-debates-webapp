Major-General STANLEY, Pulaski:

Your dispatch of 2 p. m. yesterday received. Sorry to hear that your train has been so much delayed. When it reaches you, you should forage, principally northeast of Pulaski, between the roads to Shelbyville and Columbia. The forage about Fayetteville will be needed for the cavalry when it goes from this place. Have received a dispatch from General Hatch giving me his and Croxton's positions. They must hold them as long as possible, and should the enemy overpower them and march on Pulaski you most hold that place, but should he avoid Pulaski and move north so place your troops as to cover Nashville, and strike him on the first favorable opportunity which may be presented. A. J. Smith troops will begin to arrive soon, and the cavalry from Louisville, where it has been sent to be mounted. We shall then be able to assume the offensive.
