Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The different corps of the army engaged in the recent reconnaissance returned yesterday afternoon to their several positions, since which all is quiet. Late in the morning small bodies of the enemy's cavalry appeared and followed the withdrawal, evidently simply as observers. Signal officers reported at intervals during the afternoon the return of bodies of the enemy to their lines and toward Petersburg. I forward a dispatch received at 12 m. to-day from Major-General Hancock.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 29, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Egan reports that his skirmishers, who had crossed the run above the bridge preparatory to his infantry attack, captured one gun and limber full of ammunition. The gun was captured by a few men of the One hundred and sixty-fourth New York, the regiment selected to carry the position. When General Egan moved his troops against the enemy who wee attacking Mott, these skirmishers, who were left to head the bridge, chopped the spokes off the wheels and threw the gun into the mill-pond. The officer with the party thinks the gun entirely covered. General Egan has three stand of colors.
