Captain ROBERT H. RAMSEY,Assistant Adjutant-General to General Thomas:

Since writing my dispatch of 12 m., I have examined the map. It seems to me if Lyon is moving by Larkinsville, he will be able to get across the Tennessee by swimming, if in no other way, before I can possibly intercept him. It is fifty miles from here to Huntsville, and nearly sixty from there to Stevenson, seventy from there to Larkinsville, fifty from Larkinsville to Decherd. To march either of these distances rapidly would dismount the entire command. Please let me know if I shall delay my march to Eastport, and how long. I have directed Colonel Harrison, who goes to Pulaski with one regiment and a battery of his brigade [the balance are transferred and dismounted], to send a reconnaissance toward New Market, and in case the report in regard to Lyon turns out correct, to go after him with all the detachments he can find.

Your directions to Colonel Harrison to be on the lookout for General Lyon will, the general commanding says, be sufficient, and your command can proceed on its way to Eastport as soon as they receive rations. General Johnson has also been directed to have a regiment he is sending to Pulaski be on the lookout for Lyon also.

Colonel T. J. HARRISON,

Commanding First Brigade, Sixth Division:

I have just received a dispatch from General Thomas saying a report had been received to the effect that the rebel General Lyon had crossed the Chattanooga and Nashville Railroad, between Elk River and Decherd, and was marching toward Larkinsville and Huntsville. I wish you would send a reconnaissance from the Sixteenth Illinois toward La Layette as you go to Pulaski, and see if anything can be
