Adjutant-General THOMAS:

General Banks has just informed me at Strasburg that the rebels are passing Middletown in large force, from 6,000 to 10,000, on the turnpike to Winchester. I have thrown up to that town the Tenth Maine, and will follow this afternoon with such troops as may arrive at noon. The general is to telegraph again. As it has to be transferred at this place.

I will keep you informed until I leave.

Colonel, Commanding Railroad Brigade.

Colonel MILES, Harper's Ferry, Va.:

Could you not send scouts from Winchester who would tell whether enemy are north of Banks, moving on Winchester? What is the latest you have?

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Early this morning directed Colonel Beal, Tenth Maine, to withdraw First Maryland Cavalry from the road to Romney and place them on the Middletown turnpike. The telegraph has been working to-day to Winchester. For the last two bouts, for some reason, it has ceased to do so.

Respectfully,

D. S. MILES,

Colonel, Second Infantry.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

Information received the rebels have cut the wires between Winchester and Strasburg about four hours ago; also just been informed rebel cavalry have arrived at Berryville. I have but one company, Maryland Home Guard Cavalry, at Charlestown. All the troops I can spare I have sent to Winchester. I am more than anxious to see the arrival of the re-enforcements I ordered up-Sixtieth New York, First
