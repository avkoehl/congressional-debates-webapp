present op a book.
Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President, I have re-
ceived a communication from Dr. Naphegyi,
accompanying a copy of his work now before
me entitled, "The Album of Language, illus-
trated by the Lord's Prayer in One Hundred Lan-
guages." On one of the leaves at the begin-
ning is this inscription: "To the Honorable
the Senate of the United States of America,
from the author." The work is published by
Messrs. Lippincott, of Philadelphia. The copy
offered to the Senate is bound with much care
and skill, as all will see who examine it. In
his communication the author requests me to
present this beautiful volume to the Senate,
and he mentions that it has been presented
also to the Corps Legislatif of France, where
M. Olivier performed thi3 service in his name.
I now ask that it be received by the Senate and
deposited in the Congressional Library, where
it will be free to the public.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there is no
objection that order will be made. The Chair
hears no objection.

f. j. porter pope's campaign.
Mr. CHANDLER. I offer the following
resolution, and I shall crave the indulgence of
the Senate to make a few explanatory remarks,
and perhaps I had better do so before the res-
olution is read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Michigan offers a resolution.
Mr. SUMNER. Let the resolution be read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Resolved, That the President be requested to com-
municate to the Senate, if in his judgment not incon-
sistent with the public interest, any recent corre-
spondence or information in his possession in relation
to the case of Fitz John Porter.
Mr. CHANDLER. Mr. President, I hold
in my hand the "appeal to the President of
the United States for a reexamination of the
proceedings of the general court-martial in his
case, by Major General Fitz John Porter, with
accompanying documents." Mr. Porter says,
in the beginning, that his application to the
President isâ€”
"First. To remit the sentence of the court-martial
now in force against me of disqualification 'forever
to hold any oflice of trust or profit under tho Gov-
ernment of tho United States.'
"Second. To be nominated to the Senate for restor-
ation to my rank in tho Army, under tho late net of
Congress allowing that mode of redress of wrong by
a court-martini."
He says in this " appeal
"It is matter of general information that tho alle-
gations against mo were inspired by the failure of
General Pope's campaign in Virginia. His friends
undertook to maintain that he committed no error,
and to attribute the result of his operations to tlie
defection and treasonable misconduct of certain offi-
cers and soldiers of tho Army of the Potomac who
preferred to be commanded by General McClellan."
Mr. President, it seems to me that the time
has come when the truth of history should be vin-
dicated while there are living witnesses to testily
in the case. Many of those who were conversant
with the campaign of General Pope in Virginia
and the case of Fitz John Porter have passed
from the stage. President Lincoln and Mr.
Stanton were the two men in the nation who
most thoroughly understood all the facts in
that case. General Wadsworth, who at that
time commanded the defenses of Washington,
was taken into consultation, and was pretty
thoroughly conversant with the facts.
But, Mr. President, it became my duty, in
an official capacity, as a member of the Com-
mittee on the Conduct of the War, to investi-
gate personally all these facts. Two of the
members of the committee have passed away;
and the two that remain who were, perhaps,
more conversant with them than any other two
men now living are ex-Senator from Ohio, Mr.
Wade, and myself. By permission of the Sen-
ate, I propose, as briefly as possible to state
these facts.
I am induced to do so for another reason.
About seven years ago to day, upon yonder
sofa in this Chamber, I made a voluntary pledge
to Major General Pope that justice should be
done to him and to his campaign in the valley
of Virginia, even although I were called upon
to vindicate him from my seat in the Senate.
Seven years have passed away, and many who
were then conversant with the facta have gone
to their final rest; and now I desire an oppor-
tunity, as briefly as possible, to fulfill that vol-
untary pledge upon my part.
Most Senators present are aware of the state
of intense excitement which existed after Gen-
eral McClellan's command retired to Turkey
Bend on the James river. The country was
demoralized; the premium, on gold rose to an
eaormous height, and at the same time our
bonds fell until it seemed that no bottom could
be found. Unless that army of General McClel-
lan's, then cornered up in Turkey Bend, were
saved it seemed as though the country was lost.
Before that time General Pope had been
called to take command of the " army of Vir-
ginia." And here, sir, I must express my
regret that I have so long delayed this act of
justice. I regret that I did not say what I am
about to say seven years ago ; but bow could
I or any other man suppose that so many of
the then living witnesses would pass from the
stage 1 General Pope says:
" It was the wish of the Government that I should
cover the city of Washington from any attacks from
the direction of Richmond, make such dispositions
as were necessary to assure the safety of the valley
of the Shenandoah, and at the same time so operate
upon the enemy's lines of communication in the
direction of Gordonsvillo and Charlottesville as to
draw off, if possible, a considerable force of the
enemy from Riohmond, and thus relieve the opera-
i tions against that city of the army of the Potomac.
| This was while the army of the Potomac still
; lay in front of Richmond; but a few days later
! those instructions were somewhat changed.
; And here permit me to say that during those
; dark days on one Sabbath afternoon 1 called
! at the War Office accidentally. I there found

tor from Massachusetts, [Mr. Wilson,] and
i perhaps one other person. The question
