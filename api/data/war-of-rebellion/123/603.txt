Request the surgeon who gives the certificate to do so; as when, where, and how the injury occurred must be fully set forth in all cases, for ordinary disability as well as for pensions; and the captain's certificate and muster-roll will contain the same.

PAY.

47. When no pay has been received during the term, from enrollment, say (across the two columns under "Last paid,") "Pay due from enrollment." If a payment has been made, then say, in the first of these columns, by whom the last payment was made, as "Major [R. S.

If the term of the muster and time unpaid correspond, say, in the columns respectively, "All due," or "All due but [31] rations"-state in plain figures after the word "but," the number of rations of each which have been received in kind for the time embraced. If the term of muster and time since last payment do not correspond, say, in like manner, "All due from [November 30,]" or "All due from [November 30] but [60] rations. By these data the paymaster will calculate the balances due the officers.

50. On the lines of the sergeants, and other men who are entitled to but one ration daily, state the balances due to each in figures, on every line, according to the number of days they may, necessarily,
