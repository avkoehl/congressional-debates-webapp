General WEBSTER,Nashville:

Let Sawyer transfer General Paine to the Department of the Tennessee, with orders to proceed to Columbus and report to General Washington, subject to the instructions of the President. He will make orders as to General Paine. General A. J. Smith has started from Memphis after Forrest with a well appointed force, and Washburn reports under date of the 22nd of Forrest was still at Baldwyn. Still the cavalry should move down toward Decatur.

Your telegram 22nd is received. All well. Keep General Canby advised of Smith's movements and your plans. Bear in mind also that the Tennessee River is patrolled by gun-boats, and we have a large force at Decatur.

NEW ORLEANS, June 24, 1864.

(Received 29th.)

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Memphis:

Your dispatch of the 16th and General Sherman's of the 14th have been received. The farther you can push your operations against Forrest the better for us here. This movement will supersede the necessity of the cavalry demonstration indicated in my dispatch of the 16th, but I shall still want the 5,000 infantry from your district.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General.

MOSCOW, TENN., June 24, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN:

The last of my troops will come out early to-morrow morning. I shall then have nothing but supplies to bring, and will not have the bulk forwarded until we reach La Grange, which will be about Monday noon. The brigade, at this point will be finished by Sunday night. A detachment of cavalry was sent to La Grange yesterday and found all right. Forrest is at Tupelo and vicinity.

A. M. SMITH,

Major-General.
