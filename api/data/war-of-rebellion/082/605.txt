one brigade of General Cutler's and General Ayres' division, at least, to support General Burnside. If I can withdraw the most of my picket-line, and abandon the southernmost redoubt on the plank road I can also have two brigades of General Crawford to aid General Burnside. I would like special instructions on this point. In the event of success the division of Crawford would be well posted to follow up along the plank road. I am going to consult with General Burnside as to the co-operation he wishes me to give.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Abandon all south of the large redoubt; keep on the pickets.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The commanding general desires to keep up the impression that the enemy evidently entertains that we are withdrawing from before Petersburg, and with that view wishes that the camps of such of your troops as are not necessary to the defense of your line, and as may be in the view of the enemy, should be struck and the troops moved off as though intended to cross the James River at Deep Bottom. After moving so far int the woods as to be unobserved by the enemy they should halt, and return after dark. The two brigades from General Burnside's corps holding the entrenchments between the plank road and the old Norfolk road are directed to rejoin General Burnside as soon as it is dark, taking their pickets.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

The troops should not know they are making a feint movement. Field's division, of Longstreet's corps, moved to the James River last night, leaving two divisions of Beauregard's corps and one of Hill's for the Petersburg front.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 29, 1864 - 5 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have no troops that I can move in sight of the enemy without causing them to be severely shelled at close range; in fact, all are out of sight except in the trenches.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
