Major ECKERT,

War Department:

Gaine's Cross-Roads is on the road from Culpeper to Chester Gap. I have information that the rebel column passed through Chester Gap on Thursday [11th] and Friday. Fifteen thousand infantry and artillery and a good deal of cavalry were left a Culpeper, and are now there. My scouts just in from Barbee's Cross-Road and Chester Gap. No signs of enemy between this and those points. Shots were heard to-day a long distance off, in the direction of Harper's Ferry.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac, Dumfries:

I ordered the supply trains to turn off at Bristoe, and to cross the Occoquan above Cedar Run to Centreville. Birney's train may have gone in that way, but I do not think any others. I will be here to-night with Pleasonton. Meade is at Catlett's; Howard at Centreville. Doubleday is at Kettle Run, and will move to Manassas to-night; Meade early in the morning. Birney will be at Catlett's also to-night.
