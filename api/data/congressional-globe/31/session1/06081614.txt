fttE CONGRESSIONAL GLOMi]
Aug. 20,
enable, chairman knew that there was an act re-
quiring that no property should be purchased for
the United States until the validity of the title was
Established ?
Mr. B^lYLY stated that the United States At-
torney of Louisiana had examined this title, and
pronounced it to be good. The title doubtless was
good in the vendor. The officers who made the
purchase were acting in violation of law.
Mr; JONES moved to strike out " 15,000," and
to insert "$1."
He then proceeded to give a history of the law,
and the proceedings in relation to the construction
of the quarters on Greenwood Island, stating that
when the bill was passed appropriating $10i()i000*
for the erection of quarters for the sick and wound-
ed soldiers, the Secretary of War, Mr. Marcy,
or.dered General Twiggs to examine Pass Christian
and other places in that vicinity, for the purpose
of finding a suitable spot for the erection of bar-
lacks. The Surgeon General went to Pass Chris-
tian, where he found the citizens hostile to his
purpose. He then went to Greenwood Island,
containing about one hundred acres, and thns he
selected as a proper situation. The Surgeon Gen-
eral probably then made a contract for the pur-
chase of the island. Aftervva.ds General Twiggs,
accompanied by General Dusenberry, as his
Quartermaster General, arrived there; and Ordered
the Surgeon General to continue his arrangements.
When the accounts were brought to the depart-
ment for settlement, the accounting officers' of the
Treasury refused to allow the item for the pur-
chase of the island, and the Secretary of War sus-
tained this refusal, alleging that General Twiggs
had no light to make-the purchase. He under-
stood that the property was worth more than the
price paid for it The Surgeon General offered to
take it at $5,000, and he thought it would be the
best course if Congress would let him have it, and
so lose the other $10,000. We had received no
valid tide, and han no authority to hold it from
the State in which it lies.
Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi, said the
whole case was comprised in a nutshell. The
island had leen bought without the authority of
law. It htfd been purchased at a price below its
valqe. Surgeon General Lawson was willing to
give more for it than it had cost. There was
no particular impropriety in the act of purchasing
the property. Government ought to have some
point where she can collect her troops; and this is
perhaps the most healthy place in that vicinity.
There are thousands along the coast who would
be jflad to purchase the island from us.
The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
Mr. VENABLE moved that the committee
rise, but subsequently withdrew the motion.
Mr. JONES moved to amend by striking out
u ten'* and inserting " five." He only did this
for the purpose of suggesting to the committee,
that out of the ยง500,000 which had been granted
for these objects, General Brooke had expended
some $200,000, which will come up here by and
by for the sanction of Congress.
Mr. HALL opposed the amendment, because
he regarded the whole proceedmgas in violation of
law. There was no authority given for the pur-
chase of the island, nor for the erection of any
pcinmnent quarters. It was the object of the
Government only to have temporary occupation
there. He admitted that the island was obtained
at alow rate; but if we retained it, we should
soon be "called on to pay for the erection of walls,
and forts, and arsenals; works which experience
taught us when once begun were never finished.
This purchase had been" made by a military offi-
cer in violation of Jaw.
Mr BAYLY said that not a dollar had been
expended in the purchase of the island.
Mr. McCLERN AN D modified his amendment.
He went into the facts of the case, asserting
that the whole transaction was a violation of law.
Mr. BAYLY replied with some warmth, when,
The committee rose and reported progress, and,
on motion, the House adjourned.
IN SENATE.
Tuesday, Augmt 20, 1850.
Mr. GREENE presented a memorial of the
committee of the Boston Society of Natural His-
tory, setting forth that the interests of science and
the advancement of practical knowledge of value
to the country, require that the commissioner
having charge of the boundary between California
and New Mexico, should be aided in his explora-
tion by a corps of experienced and scientific natu-
ralists, and asking that an appropriation be granted
to carry the same into effcct; which was referred
to the select committee on the subject.
Mr. MANGUM presented the memorial of W.
B. Hart, the assignee of Anderson, Forrester, Cobb
& Pickens, setting forth his belief that he has an
equitable if not legal claim upon the Government of
theUnited States, for money growing outof a con-
tract between the Government and parties, for the
removal of certain Choctaw Indians, made in Sep-
tember, 1844; that the commissioner, after a la-
borious investigation, has determined that he
views the claim only as an equitable one,and~that
it is beyond his power to pay it, ar.d that the only
remedy is an application to Congress; which was
referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr^ CHASE presented five memorials, viz:
four from citizens and electors, ministers of the
Gospel, physicians, and other classes of persons,
in Cleveland, Ohio, and one from Barington and
vicinity, m the county of Washington, Pennsyl-
vania, all asking that no State may hereafter be
admitted whose constitution does not expressly
prohibit slavery; which were received and ordered
to lie on the table.
Also, five memorials, four from the same place
in Ohio, and one from the same place in Pennsyl-
vania, asking that Congress will repeal all laws
authorizing slavery in the District of Columbia, or
remove the seat of Government therefrom; which
were received and oidered to he on the table.
Also, six memorials from the same place in Ohio,
one from the county of Gloucester, in New Jeisey,
and one from Washington county, Pennsylvania,
asking that slavery and the slave trade may be
prohibited by Congress in all the Territories of the
United States; which were received and ordered
to lie on the table.
Also, five memorials, four from the same place
in Ohio, and one from the same in Pennsylvania,
requesting that provision be made by law that
whenever a person shall be arrested as a fugitive
slave in any State other than that in which he is
alleged to be held in service, he shall not be de-
livered to the claimant or his agent except on the
finding of a jury; all of which were received and
ordered to lie on the table.
