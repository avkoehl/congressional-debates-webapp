Major-General PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

All is quiet along my front. A force of 3, 000 of the enemy's cavalry are reported at Little Washington. The pickets of the enemy are about 2 miles from Gaines' Cross-Roads. If that portion of my command now absent with unserviceable horses were here, I would like to make a demonstration in the vicinity of Little Washington, but in my present weakened condition I hardly deem it advisable. Last night my train arrived, and I am now well supplied. My horses have been several days without forage, but I hope our present supply will improve their condition. I caused my train to unload this remaining here long enough to allow Pinnington to go to Washington and get a new battery, excepting guns?

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. A. CUSTER,

Brigadier-General.
