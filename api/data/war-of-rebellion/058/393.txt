Brigadier-General CHAMBERS,

Commanding Third Brigade, First Division:

GENERAL: Major-General Sherman reports Meridian undoubtedly evacuated. Lee's cavalry on our right flank, with a view most probably of pitching into our train. You will remain where you are, to render the train secure beyond all hazard, until further orders. Should there be any prospect of a fight in front you will be ordered up without fail. You will see that all proper dispositions of the troops left to guard the train are made, so that no surprise can be effected by the enemy. Rumors from citizens place Sooy Smith's cavalry 7 miles north of Meridian yesterday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
