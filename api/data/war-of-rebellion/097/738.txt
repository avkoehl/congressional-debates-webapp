to wait at this juncture for authority from a similar council, which will shortly convene, before the insertion of any form which is not in our appointed liturgy. Although according to every constitutional principle of the United States, and of all the States composing the Union, there is no civil power which can prescribe the services of any church or enforce ecclesiastical discipline, yet, in acknowledgment of the political changes which have occurred, we feel authorized to omit a form which is at variance with established order, while, on the other hand, the ecclesiastical authority alone can authorize us to insert a form. We represent these circumstances to the Government in theconfident hope that no invidious distinctions will be made between ourselves and other branches of the Holy Catholic Church, and in the belief, too, that the course we are pursuing will tend, more than any other, to the preservation of peace and good order.
