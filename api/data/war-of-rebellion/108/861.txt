Respectfully returned with paper asked for.

I was obliged to limit the quartermaster because many of them were taking all that citizens had. This was particularly the case with the cavalry.

Major General G. E. PICKETT,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of yesterday was received last night with the accompanying telegrams. The difficulties of transportatioin are such as to preclude any movements by rail this way unless absolutely necessary. This remark is in reply to the question in the last clause of first paragraph of your letter. Your scouts should be very active and vigilant to keep us advised of all movements about Suffolk and Portsmouth, especially during the absence of troops from their regular positions.

Very respectfully,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

Deserters report that the enemy is concentrating at Williamsburg under Burnside for an advance up the Peninsula. Nine gun-boats have gone up Pagan Creek; firing heard in that direction, supposed to be shelling signal station. Two French vessels have anchored near city Point. The above from scouts on James River. Colonel Griffin, at Franklin, reports a small cavalry force of the enemy to have appeared five miles from that place.
