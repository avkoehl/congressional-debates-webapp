WASHINGTON, D. C., February 27, 1865-4 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

It has been suggested that an expedition be sent from here to destroy the Rapidan railroad bridge and the railroad to Culpeper. Would the advantage equal the waste of horse-flesh? Nine regiments and three companies of infantry and five companies of artillery have been sent within the last twelve days to Nashville from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

An expedition to destroy the Rapidan railroad bridge would serve as a diversion in favor of Sheridan. Unless he has directed it, however, I would not order it. If he has directed it, let the expedition go.
