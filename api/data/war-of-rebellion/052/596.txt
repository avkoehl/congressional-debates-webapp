WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., September 13, 1863-1 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga:

There is no intention of sending General Burnside into North Carolina. He is ordered to move down and connect with you. Should the enemy attempt to turn your right flank through Alabama, Chattanooga should be turned over to Burnside and your army, or such part of it as may not be required there, should move to prevent Bragg from re-entering Middle Tennessee. Hurlbut will aid you all he can, but most of Grant's available force if west of the Mississippi.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CHATTANOOGA, September 13, 1863-7.20 p. m.

(Received 1.20 p. m., 14th.)

Colonel A. STAGER,

Washington, D. C.:

The enemy are between Thomas and McCook on the south and Crittenden and Granger on the north, and day before yesterday gave Negley a thrashing. To-day Crittenden has been engaged. Rosecrans went down this p. m., and by day after tomorrow or Wednesday you may look to hear of Bragg getting hurt. We are in a ticklish place here, but hope to come out with whole skin. Can do nothing but wait.

J. C. VAN DUZER.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, September 13, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: Signal dispatch from Rossville 2.20 p. m. says: "All silent now." Colonel Price, whose regiment (Twenty-first Kentucky) is at Whiteside's, was here just now; says he has scouted the whole country in that vicinity in search of rebel cavalry without finding any force. Has picked up a number of deserters.

Respectfully,

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
