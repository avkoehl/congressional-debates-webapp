WASHINGTON, D. C., March 24, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

Is there sufficient force along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio road for its protection? That is with the West a vital point, and as it is now ready to be opened no effort should be spared to secure it from further interruption.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

There is ample force along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to protect it. It is probable that the guards were temporarily reduced yesterday to re-enforce Winchester. The exigencies have passed. There should no longer be any difficulty. I will call General Shields' attention to this matter, which had not escaped my attention.

Colonel HOLLIDAY, Poolesville:

Enemy have reappeared in front of Winchester. Were badly handled by General Shields yesterday, and will probably be disposed of to-day. What force has De Korponay at Leesburg? What force have you, and can you get over the river with it?

Major-General.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

De Korponay had at Leesburg 280 men. He started to join his regiment at Aldie this morning. I have 770 Vermont cavalry mounted, 636 Eighth New York Cavalry dismounted and guarding the river for 30 miles. Can cross the river at the rate of 20 mounted men per hour. The arms of both regiments are very poor.
