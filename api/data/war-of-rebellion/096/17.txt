Transportation could have been furnished at Stephenson's Depot at 10 a. m. to-morrow, the 3rd, but I have not given the order for it to come until the transports are ready at Baltimore. Please inform me when they will be ready.

Captain CHARLES L. WICKERSHAM,Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that yesterday, January 1, 1865, two soldiers belonging to the Thirteenth New York Cavalry while on their way to this post were attacked by about twenty rebels who were concealed in the woods near Freedom Hill, Va. One of the men and one horse captured; the other one had three balls pass through his clothes, slightly wounding him on the left side and thumb. His horse ran to the camp of the Sixteenth New York; he escaped by pretending to be unable to ride. This man stated that he had permission to come to this post from Colonel Gansevoort. On receiving the above information I sent out 100 men of the Sixteenth New York Cavalry to scour the country for ten to fifteen miles in front; they returned at dark, seeing nothing, but heard that seven rebels passed in the direction of Jackson's Mills, thence to Dranesville.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. GALLUPE,

Colonel Fifth Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery, Commanding Post.
