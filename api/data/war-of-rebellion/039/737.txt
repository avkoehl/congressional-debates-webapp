Numbers 285. Report of Colonel William R. Creighton, Seventh Ohio Infantry.

NEAR AQUIA LANDING, VA.,

May 9, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the Seventh Regiment Ohio Volunteers Infantry in the late engagement at Chancellorsville, Va.:

The regiment arrived at Chancellorsville Thursday p. m., April 30, and encamped for the night on the road leading southeast from Chancellorsville, on the south of the Fredericksburg Plank road.

Friday, the 1st instant, the regiment was unemployed until 11 a. m., when it advanced with the brigade out on the south and east road, and formed part of the second line of battle in the open wood lot, facing southeast from this point. It moved east with the brigade through the woods about half a mile, remaining there until ordered back. It returned to camp about 4 p. m., and in a short time was ordered farther back, and formed the second line of the battle, facing south at the edge of the woods directly south of the large brick house called the Chancellorsville place. Just before dark the regiment was ordered by General Geary to move to the left to support Knap's (Pennsylvania) battery against an attack coming from the woods bordering on the southeast road. At this point, while lying on the ground, 1 man was killed and 2 severely wounded in Company. A by the carelessness of Company I, Fifth U. s. Artillery, which was in our rear.

The regiment remained near this point during the night and forenoon of the following day, the 2nd instant, supporting Knap's battery, but were not actively engaged.

About noon of this day we were ordered to move out on each side of the road leading southeast, to support skirmishers from the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania volunteers and to clear the woods of the enemy's skirmishers and sharpshooters. At this time the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania refused to advance, and my column passed through them. During the early part of this engagement some of the regiments in our rear, believed to be from General Kane's brigade, commenced firing over our heads and to our right and left, supposing that we were outflanked, and thereby creating some confusion, but which was soon remedied. On the right wing several men are believed to have been killed by this fire. The Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania skirmishes soon fell back, and our regiment took the advance, moving forward on both
