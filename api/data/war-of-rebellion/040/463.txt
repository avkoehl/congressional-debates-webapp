HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 10, 1863-10 a.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

From the most reliable information I have been able to gather, railroad communication between Fredericksburg and Richmond, by the direct route, was interrupted but for one day. The bridges of importance appear to have remained untouched. With the exception of Kilpatrick's operations, the raid does not appear to have amounted to much. However, some reports have yet to come in. My instructions appear to have been entirely disregarded by General Stoneman. I shall know particulars soon.

Please inform me what force is at West Point. What is General Peck doing, or expected to do? The bulk of Longstreet's army is reported to be at City Point, within easy supporting distance to Lee's army on my resuming operations.

Major-General HOOKER,

Falmouth, Va.:

General Dix's forces at West Point are 5,000 infantry, two batteries, and 100 cavalry. Peck at last accounts, was pushing the forces of the enemy in front of Suffolk, in order to ascertain their strength. General Dix reports Longstreet at Richmond. General Peck's forces are about 20,000.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just heard from the enemy opposite me. For several days they have been returning to their camps, and that by to-night they expected to be re-established in them. Their location very nearly the same as before the fight.
