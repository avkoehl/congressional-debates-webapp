BERMUDA FRONT, April 1, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

A man was captured belonging to Finegan's brigade who reports no change. Communication with pickets on right developed no change. It is morally certain that Mahone's division, undiminished, is still in our front. If nothing is developed by the artillery firing I will not send out the skirmish line I think.

Major-General.

APRIL 1, 1865-2 p.m.

Major General G. L. HARTSUFF:

I approve that plan. I know the line. It is very strong. That plain on the left is swept by batteries on the hill.
