So the íulea were not suspended
On motion of Mr MARVIN, it was
Resolved, That the Committee on Commerce be in-
structed to inquire into the expediency of making appropri-
ations for the «un et of the bar ind Inrbors of the following
rivers and poits in Florida with a view to the improvement
of the same The bar of the river St Johns, and the river
and harbor of St Mai lis, and more especially the new and
better ctnnne! recently discoveied by Benjamin ihomton,
Esq , of said Territory
MATERIAL FOR THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
Mr PRATT begged permission of the House j
to offer theiesolutton, which, at his solicitation,
had been ordered to be printed on a former day
He said we have bills now before us for con
I sttucting a lire-proof War and General Post Of-
fice Department, and it was of the utmost import-
ance that the resolution should be immediately
considered He said the interest, as well as the
honor of the country, in his humble opinion, re-
quited that those buildings should be constructed
of such material as would be permanent He then
refened to the comparative cheapness of granite
and marble as a reason why they should give
them the piefeience to sandstone, which is now
being used in the construction of the Patent Of
fice and Treasury Department. He conceived it
tobe their duty to use the best materials, more
especially when they can be procured at a much
less expense than the inferior He hoped, at
least, that the public mind might be called to the
subject, whatever might be the disposition the
House made of the resolution He hoped, how-
' evei, it would agree to consider it at the present
time
Objection being made to its consideration,
Mi   P. moved to suspend the rules tor that
purpose, which motion wasagiced to
The íesolution was then lead, as follows
Whereas!, tin mitf rials u edm the c reeiion of the Preaa
urv builduigin this city lie ..ongelatid sand tone, absorbing
witer ind requiring to be frequently punted at gre it e\
pense, to preserve iti-,imst ri n ind frost   Then tore
Resolved, as the sense of this House, I h u ill public build
ings hereafter to he erecti d tor the use of the Government
sh ill be constructed of the hardest and most durable mite
rial , eitlu r ot m n ble or granite
Mr P moved its reference to the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds
Mr TALIAPERRO moved, as instructions to
the said committee, a pioposition offered by him
the other day asan amendment to the íesolution,
which proposition, having been then ordered to
be printed, was now in the hands of the public
printer, and the purpoit of which Mi T explained
in the course of his íemarks
Mi   T  moved that the furthtr consideiation of
the subject be postponed  until  to morrow, and
proceeded to say (as he was understood) that this
I preamble contained certain things as to materials
which had not, in the com se of long experience,
' been found to be true     The preamble assumed
I that heestone lequixd for its  presetvation fie-
I quent and constant painting     Iheie weie build-
ings erected of this m uenal which had been built
moie than a hundred yeais, on which  a paint
brush had nevei fallen, and which weie now as
sound and unimpiired as they were the day they
were built     He alluded particula-ily to the build-
ings of Governor Spotswood, of Virginia, and
another, near which, according to the best of his
! recollection, a paint brush had never been, and
which had sustained no manner of injury beyond,
possibly, some little discoloration
As to the laboiatones which were nowabout to
be built, (for such he designated these Depait-
ments,) he was astonished to find that gentlemen
had become so magnificent in then ¡deis that
' nothing would suit them shoit of maibleor gran
lte He would go along with any gentleman in
every proper expenditure of the public money
for where was the necessity of building these
Departments on the scale of palaces' If they
were built of a matenal respectable in its appeai-
ance and enduring in its nature, the public should
not expect anything beyond the outlay necessary
to secuie these two ob]ects
Now, his amendment provided, in substance,
that all the public buildings which m ght heie
after be constructed in Washington should be
built of the same matenal as the house in which
they now were The Piesident's mansion, the
Treasury building, the Patent Office, were all
built of one material, and he asked that all future
buildings might be similaily built, unless a che \per
and more stable material could be used. Theie
was no better looking edifice in the country than
this house, or the President's mansion, or than
those now piepanng for the Treasury Depart-
ment and the Patent Office He was opposed to
all unnecessary expense, and, if this resolution
was to go to the committee, he hoped that bis
amendment would he suffered to go along with it.
Mr LINCOLN was opposed to the postpone-
ment, as calculated to prevent any definite action
on the subject during the present session of Con-
giess It would be íecollected that to-day and
to morrow had been specially set apart for the
consideiation of terntoual business, and if the
I postponement took place as proposed, it might
require a suspension of t^e rule to get at this
I subject, so that postponement till to-morrow
might, in fact, be equivalent to postponement for
the residue of the session Already this morn-
ing a question involving, in some degree, the
same subject matter of inquiry, had been referred
' to the committee Nothing, therefore, was to be
gained by postponement
As to the matenal, he thought he could satisfy
the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Taliaferro]
that a more wasteful expenditure of the public
money had never been known in this GovernmeTnt
than that in the purchase of the material for the
public buildings, to say nothing of the shape or
plan. It would cost the Government $69,000
more for the construction of a building of such
material than if constructed of another "What
was this congelated sandstone' There were
now, in buildings constructed of that stone,
masses of rude clay, the water had got in, which,
with the expansion of frost, had riven asunder
some of the parts A portion might be perfo-
rated by a fine stick, and it was necessary for the
workmen to take it out It was very unsafe and
insecuie, and, instead of giving fifty-seven cents
a foot fortluscongelated sandstone,granite might
be obtained at forty cents At this very moment
theie was an application beiore the Committee on
Public Buildings for an appropriation of $12,000
to paint the very structure now in the course of
erection Twenty thousand dollars had been
expended in five years for that object The stone
was such an absorbent of watei that the building
could not be secure unless it was painted     As to
' the appearance, he cared little about it, whether
painted or not, but he looked to the extravagant
waste of the public money By using another
material, more than thirty-six per cent would be
saved upon the cost, besides the expense of
painting every three years
He thought the subject should go to the com-
mittee, whose duty it would be to leport all the
facts—what was the cheapest and best material
of which to constiuct these buildings
Mi BRONSON inquired what would be the
effect of the previous question '
I     The SPEAKER said it would be to bring the
j House to a vote on the resolution
I Mr BROJNbO^N said he would not then move
it, but would move to lay the subject on the table.
Mi THOMAS susgested that a memorial had
this morning been lefeired to the Committee on
Public Buildings of the same purport as this res-
olution The power of the committee, therefore,
would be neither met eased nor diminished by the
reference of this íesolution
Mr KUONSON withdiew his motion to lay
on the table at the request of
Mr TALIAFERRO, who said he could not
well peiceive how the House could get into a de-
bate on a matter of this kind. The proposition
was a very simple one, and if the gentleman fiom
,1 Massachusetts [Mi   Lincoi m] was correct in his
I' statement of facts, there could be no further ques-
'i tion If granite could be furnished cheapei than
any other material, then he (Mr T ) was for
gianite Butwhatdid all the estimates of the
mi chames say, when the Tie<tsuiy building and
the Patent Office weie about to be constructed ?
The whole estimates showed that the expense of
building withgiamte would be more than double
| He was willing to make issue with the gentleman
fiom Massachusetts, and if the gentleman would
I  peimit the íesolution to pass with the modifica-
tion whicl he (Mr P ) would suggest, namely
th it the cheapest plan should be adopted, there
would be an end of the matter
II       Mi   PR \1 T said he would accept tne modifi-
I   cation     He was one of the Committee on Public
i Buildings and Grounds, and eoncetved it hisduty
II  to bung the matter befoie theHouse     His sense
