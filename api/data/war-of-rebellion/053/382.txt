La Grange. Let me know when you can come back, as I must move on. I hear of no enemy threatening our road, except that of Chalmers', which was hard pressed by Hatch at Wyatt; on the Tallahatchie, two days ago.

Major-General.

General OSTERHAUS,

Iuka:

All of Hurlbut's cavalry except the Alabama regiment are off with Hatch. Secure if practicable all the boats near Eastport, and get all ready for the railroad bridge at Bear Creek. I will send for-
