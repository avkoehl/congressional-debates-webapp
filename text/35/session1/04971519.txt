jected to giving me an extension of time, and I
cannot now yield to him. In this connection, a
gentleman on the other side of the House, with
an air of very great confidence, rose yesterday in
his place—I allude to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. Grow]—and told us that the price
of a soldier twenty years ago was $350, and that
in the year 1858 it :s §1,400. I will furnish him
with a table that will show him exactly the cost
per man, and which is a little over one half of the
gentleman's estimate of yesterday:

Mr. GROW. I read from the statement made
in the Senate by Mr. Davis.
Mr. LETCIIER. I cannot yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. GROW. I do not want the gentleman to
yield to mc.
Mr. LETCHER. If the gentleman will look
a little further he will find that out of this $786,
$400 is for transportation. So that if the soldier
coat, twenty years ago, $350, (deducting this in-
creased transportation, owing to th'e acquisitions
made to the country,) he only costs now $36 83
more than he did twenty years ago.
Now, sir, how comes this increased transpor-
tation ? Let us see. Here is the Quartermaster
General's account of it, and I think it is a very
satisfactory account:
" Previous to the annexation of Texas our extreme west-
ern posts were Fort Wilkins, on Lake Superior; Fort Snel-
l ng,.at the junction of the Mississippi river with St. Peter;
Foi t Atkinson, twenty-tour nuJes from the Mississippi river;
Fort Leavenworth, on the Missouri river; Fort Scott, on the
southwestern frontier of the State of Missouri; Fort Gibson,
on the waters of the Arkansas ; Fort Washita, in the Choc-
taw country, neai to Red river; FortTowson, six miles from
Red nver; and Fort Jesup, twenty-four miles from that
nver. Of these posts, Forts Gibson, Leavenwoith, Snellmg,
and Wilkms, were accessible by steamers; Foit Washita
was eighty-six, and Fort Scott ninety miles from steam
navigation; hut the latter was situated in a well cultivated
and laptdly improving countiy, and mos>t of the heavy sup-
plies foi its garnson were obtained in the neighboihood.
Fort Washita was then the only outpost depending upon
the inteiior for all its supplies ; and it was at a less distance
from ciie post whence it was supplied than from Baltimore
to Philadelphia; while several of the land routes over
which the supplies for the troops aie now transported are
longer than from this city to St. Louis or New Orleans.
There has been a vast increase in the cost of labor and of
ail supplies in the last ten years ; but leaving that entirely
out of view, the va«t distances now to be traversed m ter-
ritories with scarcely any other resources than a scanty sup-
ply of wild grass, with the constant operations necessarily
being carried on, ia sufficient to aecouut for the increased
individual cost of the military force."
Sir, is not this a satisfactory explanation of the
increased cost attending the expense of a soldier
from $350 to $786? In the very case now under
consideration, here is a transportation of twelve
hundred miles from Fort Leavenworth to Utah,
which is the scene of this difficulty between the
Territory and this Government, and where these-
troops are to be employed; Fort Laramie is some
six hundred miles off, and Fort Kearny, I believe,
between two and three hundred miles. We have
acquired Texas, and the defense of that State is
to be attended to. We have acquired the coun-
try on the Pacific coast, and that is to be attended
to. We have acquired Oregon and Washington,
where posts have been established, and to which
transportation has to be made. Is it at all won-
derful, then, that when the extent of our country
is more than doubled, when we have that much
more to defend than we had before, there should
be an enhanced price for transporting troops, with
a limited army of fifteen thousand men, to supply
these posts as occasion and necessity require ?
Besides all that, a part of this very deficiency has
been left as a legacy to this Administration from
the preceding one. I have had a table prepared
which I have here, showing how much was left
over and when it accumulated.

QuaHTMIMA-STER Ceneral's Office, "VVasiiington City, January 23,185S.
Here, then, was a deficiency of $1,228,679 31,
that has come down to this Administration, with
estimates for which it did not prepare. It could
not guard against this deficiency i n any way what-
soever. And it has come down with this Utah
difficulty accumulated upon it.
Sir, will it be contended here that the Secretary
of War is to be arraigned because of this defi-
ciency which has grown up under a previous Ad-
ministration ? Is he to be held accountable for
it? I apprehend not. The expenditures already
made on account of this Utah expedition, by the
Quartermaster's department, are, for regular sup-
plies, $27,776 40; incidental expenses, $ 10,82896;
mountsand remounts, $68,802 50; mileage, $2,500;
for Transportation of troops and for supplies,
$1,411,876 33; barracks and quarters, $7,302 06;
amounting, in the aggregate, to $1,529,086 25;
and these are articles that are yet to be furnished,
in order to supply these troops, to give them the
means of support during the coming winter, and
to protect them, to say nothing of the four addi-
tional regiments that the House has ordered. Let
me say here that if this Utah expedition was im-
properly begun, if the President is to be arraigned
for it here, I desire to know from gentlemen upon
this floor why they did not raise this question on
the day Congress met, and put an end to the ex-
pedition ? If they thought that the expedition was
begun wrong, or had been prosecuted unwisely,
then was the time to begin, and they could then
at once have said to him," this thing is improper,
and we order it to be stopped; bring home your
troops." Rut this was not done, sir. They first
adopt a resolution declaring that there is rebellion
in Utah; they then come in here and pass a bill
for four additional regiments, to enable the Pres-
ident to prosecute the war thus improperly be-
gun. And now we are told that these moneys are
to be withheld, because he did not call Congress
together when he undertook the expedition, and
get their consent before it was commenced. I say,
then, sir, that the House is doing injustice to itself,
after its own action in this matter, and still greater
injustice to the President, when it proposes now
to charge that this thing has been improperly
done.
Sir, we have had a good deal said here upon
another subject connected with this matter. I
was sorry to hear the gentleman from Tennessee
[Mr. Jones] lending his name to this idea that is
floating about in regaid to contracts, and to the
advantage that these contracts are to the War
Department. He did, sir, very great injustice to
himself, as well as very great injustice to the
cer who presides over that Department, as the
facts which have been brought before the House
establish conclusively. But the gentleman from
Illinois [Mr. Lovejoy] was not content to rely
upon insinuations. He charged that this Utah
war was a war of plunderers and speculators, and
said he did not know what it would cost to get
these contracts at the War Department Now,
sir, has there been anything in the character or
J. SIBLEY, Major and Quartermaster.
conduct of the Secretary of War which would
justify an imputation of this sort upon him ? Has
the gentleman any evidence to warrant it? Why,
yes, sir; he tells us that a contractor furnished
him the information; but when called upon to
give us the name of the contractor, he says that
he cannot do it; that it might be that the seal of
private confidence was upon that communication
when made to him. Mr. Chairman, I ask him
in all sincerity and kindness, if he could not fur-
nish the name, why was not the seal of private
confidence upon the communication, and why
could it be given, and not the name ? Why could
the name not be furnished ? Why was the state-
ment made and the name not furnished? But
now the report comes in, and the gentleman's al-
legations are distinctly met. Who is the con-
tractor now ? Who is it that has given currency
to this libel against the head of the War Depart-
ment? The gentleman will recognize the prin-
ciple of law that, if he undertakes to circulate a
report unfounded in fact against any one, and,
when called upon, refuses to furnish the name of
a responsible informant, he is held in law liable
for the libel which he circulates. And I think
that it would be so held not only m law, but in
good morals. I therefore call upon the gentle-
man, in all kindness, to let us know who this
hbeler of the Secretary of 'War is. It is due to
his reputation to inform us
Mr. LOVEJOY. If the gentleman will give
time to refer to this discussion and set the
