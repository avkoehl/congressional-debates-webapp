HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., January 20, 1865.

Major General RICHARD DELAFIELD,

Commanding Corps of Enginneers, Washington City, D. C.:

(Though Headquarters Department of the Pacific.)

GENERAL: I write this letter to recommend that an appropriation be obtained for the erection of defenses at Point Defiance and Gig Harbor, opposite, on Puget Sound, Wash. Ter. It was surveyed and a military reservation made there on the 9the of October, 1860, by Lieutenant T. L. Casey, of the Corps of Engineers. I think that Major Ten. I. McDowell, commanding the department, who inspected last August the site, will report in favor of its being fortified. Having often traversed the waters of the sound, I have always condidered it the most eligible point for a fortification. I shall send this through headquarters Department of the Pacific.

I am, with high respect, you obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.

S. military authorities.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
