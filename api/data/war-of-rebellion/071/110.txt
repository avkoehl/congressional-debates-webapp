The force engaged on our side were Third Maryland Potomac Home Brigade, 250 men; Eighth Illinois Cavalry, Lieutenant-Colonel Clendenin commanding; three guns Alexander's battery, under his command, and several detachments, including the 100-days' men, Captain Leib commanding.

Losses unknown. This is not official.
