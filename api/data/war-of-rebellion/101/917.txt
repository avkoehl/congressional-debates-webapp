Major-General DODGE:

Governor Crawford, who will leave Leavenworth about the 24th for Washington, desires that I should accompany him to Saint Louis to consult with you upon some matters of importance. It is quite important that I should have a personal interview with you; therefore I have the honor to request permission to go Saint Louis with the governor. Please answer by telegraph.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

It will not do far Canby to risk Smith with any military command whatever. The moment Canby should differ with him in judgement as to what is to be done, and be would be obliged to differ or yield to him entirely, he would get no further service out of him, but on the contrary, he would be a clog. Let Smith continue on the same duty he has been detailed for.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, February 20, 1865.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
