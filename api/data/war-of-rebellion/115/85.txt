Major General JOHN A. DIX, Fort McHenry, Baltimore.

GENERAL: I inclose a letter* of the 28th ultimo and its accompaniments addressed to Mr. Cameron by J. Hopkins Tarr, from Denton, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, relative to Judge R. B. Carmichael, of that quarter. It seems to me that that functionary should be arrested even in his court if need be and sent to Fort Lafayette. You may proceed accordingly.

I am, general, your very obedient servant,

JOHN E. WARD, Esq.,

Care of Messrs. Barring Brothers &amp; Co., London.

SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Quebec, 27th ultimo,* and now take pleasure in transmitting to you the passport in accordance with your request. Owing to the representations of persons who it appears accompanied you from the South, it was deemed proper, with a due regard for the public safety, to obstruct you it the progress of your journey; but circumstances have since transpired which call for the removal of such restrictions, and the accompanying passport is therefore forwarded to you. If you deem it proper to destroy this communication you are at liberty to do so.

I am, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 3, 1861.

E. L. O. ADAMS, Portland, Me.:

Do not arrest John E. Ward.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
