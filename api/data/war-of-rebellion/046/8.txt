advantage to the enemy, in consequence of the efficient blockade of those inlets by the navy.

46. By the changes above indicated, it was found that the aggregate means for carrying on offensive operations within the department, leaving the depot at Hilton Head perfectly secure and the other important points reasonably so, comprised the forces enumerated below, viz:

Effective volunteer infantry ............................. 10,000 Volunteer artillerists for serving heavy guns and guns of position

............................................................. 350

Engineer troops.............................................. 600

Pieces of field artillery completely equipped and mounted.... 28

Pieces of field artillery without horses and but partially manned.8 Parrott rifled guns of 8 inches diameter of bore, known as 200-pounders..................................................... 5

Parrott rifled guns of 6,4 inches diameter of bore, known as 100-pounders..................................................... 9

30-pounder Parrott siege guns of 4.2 inches diameter of bore.. 12

20-pounder Parrott siege guns of 3.67 inches diameter of bore.. 4

13-inch seacoast mortars....................................... 12

10-inch siege mortars.......................................... 10

8-inch siege mortars........................................... 5

Coehorn mortars................................................ 3

There was a liberal supply of ammunition and engineering tools and materials. The entire effective force in the department, including men on extra and daily duty, was 17,463.

47. As the endurance of the Parrott guns of heavy caliber was at that time a matter of some uncertainty, requisitions were sent forward for several more of them, which were promptly filled by the Ordnance Department.

PLAN OF PRELIMINARY ATTACK.

48. The project obtaining a lodgment on Morris Island comprised three distinct operations.

First. The real attack from Folly Island to partake of the naturae of a surprise.

Second. A demonstration in force on James Island, by way of the Stono River, designed to prevent re-enforcement to the enemy on Morris Island from that quarter, and, if possible, draw a portio of the Morris Island garrison in that direction.

Third. The cutting of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad at Jacksborough be ascending the South Edisto River, in order to delay re-enforcement from Savannah, should the real attack be temporarily checked or prematurely divulged.

49. The demonstration up the Stono was commanded by Brigadier General A. H. Terry, and was eminently successful. A large part of the Morris Island garrison was drawn to James Island by it.

The attempt to cut the railroad was intrusted to Colonel [Thomas W.] Higginson, First South Carolina Volunteers, who was sent from Brigadier General R. Saxton's command, at Beaufort, for that purpose. It signally failed, with a loss to us of two pieces of field artillery and a small steamer, which was burned to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy.

50. The storming of a fortified position, excepting when preceded by the slow operations of a regular siege, which, besides partially or entirely silencing the fire of the enemy's work, will also enable the attacking column to get very near the enemy under cover before the
