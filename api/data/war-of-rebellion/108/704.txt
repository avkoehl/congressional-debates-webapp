HEADQUARTERS THIRD BRIGADE, VIRGINIA INFANTRY,Camp near United States Ford, May 7, 1863.

Captain HALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Trimble's Division:

CAPTAIN: It is all quiet along the river in our front to-day. No enemy in sight, but scattering pickets on the cliffs on opposite side of the river. The batteries from the opposite side have been withdrawn. Some smoke aristing, as though there were troops encamped back from the river. We have captured some few stragging prisoners. They admit a complete trashing and rout. We have collected a number of good guns, acoutements, &amp;c., also shoves, picks, and axes, and a large quality of fixed ammunition, which is damaged by the rain.

Respectfully,

J. Q. NADENBOUSCH,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigadier Virginia Infty., Trimble's Division.
