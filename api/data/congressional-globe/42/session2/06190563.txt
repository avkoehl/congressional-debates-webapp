Uniform Rates of Transportation—Mr. Kendall.
Ho. ot "Reps
ble regulations for the carrying of freight and
passengers?
Mr. Speaker, I had the honor to introduce,
Ajjrit 8, 1872, a bill (H. R. No. 2249) to re-
quire uniform charges for transporting freight
and passengers by railroad companies and
other common carriers, and to prevent and
punish unjust discriminations in favor of or
against particular persons or places. This
bill was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce. It is not improper to state that that
committee has had the subject under careful
consideration, and has gathered an immense
mass of facts and statistics, bearing upon this
question, from every part of the country. To
tabulate, classify, and arrange all this mate-
rial is no ordinary task. But I hope that a
full and complete report may be made upon
the subject at the next session of Congress.
The bill to which I have referred 13 as
follows:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled, That hereafter no railroad company, or
other company, corporation, or person engaged in
the business of cairyias freight or passengers over a
continuous line, extending Irom a placein one State
or Territory to a place in another State or Territory,
shall be allowed to discriminate m the prices charged
for carrying such freight or passengers, either in
favor of or against any particular person, locality,
or place, but all such charges shall be uniform, and
the charges for carrying such freight or passengers
over any part of such line shall be in proportion to
and at the same rate per mile as tbechargea for car-
rying the same class ot freight or passengers over
the whole or over any other part of said line.
Sec. 2. That every person, company, or corpora-
tion, engaged in tbe business described in the pre-
ceding section shall, on or before January 1, 1873,
make and publish a table of charges upon all kinds
of freight and upon passengers. Said table of
charges shall show the price per hundred pounds
upon all kinds of freight, for transporting such
freight over the entire line operated, and also shall
show whatsum upon the hundred poundhsuch charges
amount to per mile. Such table shall be signed by
such person, company, or corporation, and shall be
published in at least one newspaper of general cir-
culation m each State through which, or through
part of which, such line may run, and a copy thereof
shall be posted ut> publicly in each depotor officc of
such person, company, or corporation. Said table
of charges shall not be changed oftener than once
in three months, and no change increasing tbe
charges shall take effect until published as herein
provided at least ten days.
Sec. 3. That the rates to bo charged by any such
person, company, orcorporation torcarrying freights
or passengers over part of such line shall be at the
same rate per mile as for the whole lino as aforesaid ;
and any person, company, or corporation engaged
as' aforesaid, who shall bo guilty of unjust discrim-
ination by chaiging and collecting, or attempting to
charge and collect, any other or different rate than
that herein provided for, sdiall forfeit and pay a fine
of $500 for the first offense, and Si,000 for each sub-
sequent ofiense, to be recovered by suit in the name
ot the United States., to be prosecuted by civil pro-
ceedings, in any district or circuit court of the Uni-
ted States having jurisdiction of the parties. One
half of such fine shall be paid to the United States,
and the remaining half to the party injured.
Sec. 4. That in all cases where two or more per-
sons, companies, or corporations unite together for
tbe purpose of transporting freight or passengers
over several lines of railroads from a place in one
State or Territory to a place in another State or
Temtory, the several lines which are thus operated
together shad be treated for all the purposes of this
act as one line, and each and every of such persons,
companies, and corporations shall be bound by the
provisions of thi* act, and liable for any violation
thereof,
Skc. 5. That any person, company, or corporation
required by this act to make and publish a table of
its charges, neglecting or refusing to do so within
the time and m the manner provided by this act,
shall torfeit and pay to the United States a fine of
$1,000 for each and every ten daysduring which such
neglector refusal shall continue, to be recovered in
the manner provided in section three of this act.
It will be seen that the bill is general in
its provisions; yet 1 freely say it has been
framed with an immediate and special purpose,
to meet a most urgent and special demand.
The Central Pacific railroad, connecting with
the Union Pacific at Ogden in Utah, traverses
the entire State of Nevada from east to west.
In the time allowed under the rules of the
House i cannot, of course, do more than briefly
refer to the various matters involved in the
consideration of' this question.
I will not stop to argue the constitutionality
of the power of Congress to control railroad
charges, for that has been settled by the courts.
Nor will I dwell at any length in explanation
of why it is that these charges should be made
uniform and reasonable by legislation of Con-
gress rather than by legislation of the States.
It is enough for us to know that even where
States have taken the subject in hand their
own restrictive legislation upon railroad cor
porations has been utterly disregarded, so far
as the railroads are concerned, and in effect
stands upon the statute-books ofthose States as
little better than a dead letter.
In respect to these Pacific railroads—as the
cost of their construction has been paid by the
General Government, and more than paid, as
the facts I will presently state will demon
strate—there can be no good ground of objec-
tion to a general law providing for uniform*
just, and equitable charges for the transporta-
tion of freight and passengers, and preventing,
by emphatic legislation, that system of dis
criminal ioti and favoritism which results in so
much injustice to smaller communities.
In the first place, then, let us see what the
Government has done in behalf of railroad
corporations so far as grants of land have been
made to them for the purpose of their construc-
tion. I have the report of tbe Commissioner
of the General Land Office made to this House
January 10, 1872, aud not to take up too much
time I will give the recapitulation of the various
land grants, which is as follows:

It will be seen that more than one hundred
and forty-eight million acres of the public
lands have been granted for the construction
ot the Pacific railroads, and that two hundred
and seven million acres have been granted in
the aggregate for the construction of the rail-
roads of this couutry. But this is not all.
Subsidies of money were also furnished to the
Pacific railroad companies. Let rae quote
from Poor's Manual of the Railroads of the
United States for 1870-71, page 37 :
" The past year witnessed the completion of the
most important enterprise of the kind ever executed
m any country—a line of railroad from the Missouri
river across the continent, and with connecting lines,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific occan, a distance of
throe thousand three hundred miles. This great un-
dertaking was commenced in the latter part of 1863,
but no considerable amount of work was done until
1865, in which year only about one hundred miles
were constructed. In 1866 about three hundred miles
were opened; in 1867 about the same number; in
1868 about eight hundred miles: and in 1869 three
hundred miles—the whole distance from the Mis-
souri to Sacramento being one thousand seven hun-
dred and seventy-six miles.
"The act for the construction of this work pro-
vided for a branch from Kansas City, designed to
connect with the main line at the one hundredth me-
ridian, but since diverted nearly weht to the western
boundary of the State of Kansas, four hundred
miles; a branch extending from Atchison, on the
Missouri river, designed also to connect with the
main line, one hundred miles, and a branch from
Sioux City, one hundred miles, and a branch from
Sacramento to the Bay of San Francisco, one
hundred and thirty miles. The total mileage con-
structed under the authority and by aid of Cou-
gress has been two thousand five hundred miles,
namely, Union Pacific, one thousand and thirty
miles; Central Pacific of California, seven hundred
and sixfy miles; Kansas Pacific, (eastern division J
four hundred miles; the central Pacific bianch,
Atchison and Pike's Peak, one hundred miles; the
Sioux City branch, one hundred miles; and the
Western (California) Pacific, one hundred and thirty
miles. Toward the construction of these roads thu
Government has issued its six per c  nt. currency
bonds to the amount of about $63,616,000. namely,
upon three huudred miles, at the rate of £48,000 per
mile; upon nine hundred and seventy-si^ miles, at
therate of $32,000 per mile; and upon one thousand
two hundred and forty-four miles, at the rate of
$16,000 per mile. The annual interest upon the
above sum will equal $3,934,5<jJ. These bonds are a
second mortgage upon the respective lines, the sev-
eral companies bomg authorised to issue thoir own
bonds to an amount equal to the Government sub-
sidy, and to make thorn a first mortgage upon th*;*
roads."
In the above the amount of currency bonds
should be $65,636,000 instead of $03,010,000,
as anybody can discover who will mak* the
calculation.
If we turn back to the debates in the Con-
gressional Globe we will find that the provis-
ions for the security of the public in the ori-
ginal laws were afterward so modified a* to do
away with them almost entirely. I makt* an
extract from a speech of General Washburn,
of Wisconsin, a leading Republican member,
and now Governor of his State, delivered i'i
1868:
"I have thus, in as brief a manner as possible*
gone through arid stated the main conditions of the
first Pacific railroad act. It was regui ded as liberal
beyond precedent at the time, providing, as it did,
for a gift outright of a vast body of land and a loan
of over sixty million dollars, with no greater secur-
ity than what the Government had itself furnished
the means of offering, and, indeed, far 1« &s,
"Though the act was carelessly drawn, some regard
appears to have been had for the interests of th«
Government, and the following provisions were mad«
for the public security :
" 1. The Government was to have a first mortgage
on the road to secure its advances.
"2. Twenty-five per cent, of the bond"? on a p >rt
of the line and tuteen 011 tbe restwere to be reservud
until the road was completed.
"3. The price lor the transportation of Govern-
ment freight and passengers was to be applied m
liquidation of the bonds, and five per cent, of ;ke
net earning? were also to be set aside for thebsree
j purpose.
4. The amount of stock held by uny one cu&u
was limited to two hundred sh. ,re3.
"Parties were not long found wanting to avail
I themselves of thb act.
"It has already boon seen that to complete the
organize'urn it only required two thou>and shares
to bo subscribed, and one per cent, or $20,000, paid in
to perfect the organisation. P.irtieswere re^uy and
prompt to act and obtain control aud out out tbo
public, in violation of what was contemplated in
the act naming a largo number of corporators in
all parts ot the country. The organization being
completed, what was next to be done? Go on and
build the road? Not a bit of it*
