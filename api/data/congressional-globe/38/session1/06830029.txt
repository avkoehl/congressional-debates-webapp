Senate & Ho. 'op
Reference to the Auditor's Report.
The Auditor's report, No. —of the Appendix,
may be consulted for details of the revenue and
expenditures under their several heads.
Deficiency of 1863.
The estimated deficiency of revenue for 1863, as presented
in the animal report from this Department on the 2d De-
cember, 1861, was  $3,845,000 00
Deduct the actual deficiency  150,417 25
Excess of estimated over actual de-
ficiency   $3,694,589 75
The discrepancy in this particular is thus ac-
counted for. It was deemed expedient, as stated
in the report above noted, to submit partial esti-
mates for the cost of the postal service in States
and districts where it was then suspended—in the
greater portion of which, however, there has not
as yet been any'restoration of such service. The
expenditures for 1863 were then estimated at
$12,528,000, which is $1,364,210 41 in excess of
the amount actually expended. On the other
hand, the revenues of 1863 were estimated at the
usual increase of four per cent, on those of 1861,
(during the greater part of which year mail ser-
vice was interrupted throughout the Union,)
making $8,863,000, which is $2,480,789 59 less
than the actual receipts—the latter being 33£ per
cent, more than those of 1861.
Comparison of Receipts and Expenditures for 1860,
1862, and 1863.
The postal expenditure in 1860, the year immediately pro-
ceding the rebellion, was §11,874,"i72 89
The postal expenditure m 1863  i 1,31-1,206 84
Excess of expenditure in 1860    ,*;3.<"60.f>66 O.j
The actual revenue fiom postal receipts in
1863 was $11,163,789 59
The same m 1860  8.518,0(57 40
.Excess of revenue in 1S63 
$2,645,722 19
Showing that while the annual cost of postal
service is at present three and a half millions less
than when it was uninterrupted throughout the
Union, the receipts therefrom are increased to the
extent of more than two million six hundred
thousand dollars:
The expenditures of 1863 were £11.33 4,206 P4
The expenditures of 1862   11,125,364 13
Increase m 1863.
.«1SS.842 "il
The actual revenues of 1863 were $11,163,789 59
The actual revenues of J 862  8.299,820 90
Increase in 18G3.     52.863.908 69
From the above comparison of the leceipts and
expenditures of the last two fiscal yeais, it ap-
pears that the increase of expenditure in 1863
bears but d small proportion to the increase of the
revenue, the one being about 6£ per cent, of the
other.
The experience of the past year gives every
reason to believe that the gross revenues of the j
Department for the year 1864 will equal, if they j
do not considerably exceed, the estimates thereof
submitted in the last annual report, and that the
expenditures will not surpass the amount therein
stated. The appropriations already made for the
service of the current fiscal year are therefore
ample.
Estimates for 1865.
The expenditures of all kinds for the fiscal year ending June
30,1865, (hee table No. 9,) are estimated at $13,4.2:2,000 00
The gross revenue for the year 1865, includ-
ing foreign postages and miscellaneous le-
ceipts, is estimated at an increase of five
per cent, oil the revenues of 1863, making J 1,722,000 00
Estimated deficiency of revenue compared
with estimated expenditures  1,700,000 00
Cut fioiri this sum is to be deducted the
amount of the peimanent appiopriations
made by the acts of March 3, 1847, and of
March 3, 1851. to compensate the Depart-
ment lorcariying ftee mail matter  700,000 00
Bv which the estimated deficiency is re-
duced to  §1,000,000 00
being the whole amount estimated to be required
fiom the Treasuiy lor the year 1865. <;
The earnings of the Department in the trans- |[
poi tation of free mail matter during the past fiscal 'j
year have not yet been expended. 'i
In estimating the probable ^xpendituiewof 1865  i!
under the several heads of appropriation, those
of the last fiscal year have, in general, been taken
as a basis of calculation. But an increase of cer-
tain items of anticipated expenditure has been
made in order to provide, to some extent, for the
cost of restoring the postal service of the United
States in sections of the country now under insur-
rectionary control. To this cause alone is the
estimated deficiency for 1865 to be attributed.
But this deficiency is not one fifth of that of 1860
—the latter being upwards of §5,600,000.
Number of Quarterly Returns received.
The whole number of post offices in operation
during the year was 20,145, and the number of
quarterly returns received therefrom was 78,239.
Drafts and Warrants.
The whole number of drafts and warrants issued
duiing the year, in payment of balances reported
by the Auditor to be due creditors of this Depart-
ment, was ]5,944. The warrants were drawn on
the Treasurer of the United States, five Assistant
Treasurers, and seven designated depositaries,
and the diafts on twenty-five post office deposit-
aries, and on postmasters at three hundred and
fifty-eight draft offices.
Out of the net revenues of the Departmentfor
the year, the sum of $4,563,341 15, being over
sixty per cent, thereof, was concentrated in the
hands of the above-named depositaries and at
draft offices. Of this amount, $3,882,454 93 was
disbursed during the year, leaving £631,086 22
subject to draft on the 1st of July, 1863. The
remainder of the net revenue was collected by
mail contractors, by means of otders on post-
masters at collection offices,prepared and sent out
by the Auditor, and through payments by post-
masters to mail messengers and special mail-
carriers.
POSTAGE STAMPS AND STAMPED ENVELOPES.
Stamps and Envelopes issued.
The number of postage stamps, stamped en-
velopes, and newspaper wrappers, sent to post-
masters during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1863, is given in detail in table No. 10, in the Ap-
pendix to this report. The value of the stamps
issued during that period was $9,683,384; of
stamped k-tter envelopes, $634,821; and of stamped
newspaper wrappers, $20,545. The aggregate
value of the issue of the year under notice, as
compared with that of the preceding year, shows
an increase of $2,503,668. (See table No. 11.)
Value of Stamps sold.
The total value of stamps and stamped envel-
opes sold by postmusteis uurmg the year, as as-
certained from the records of the Auditor of the
Treasury for this Department, was $9,624,529 62,
which exceeds, by $2,714,397 73, the sales of the
previous fiscal year.
New Denomination of Stamps and Envelopes.
The act of March 3, 1863, entitled "An act to
amend the laws relating to the Post Office Depart-
ment," havingadvaneed the rate of postage upon
drop letters and transient printed matter to two
cents the single rate, new stamps and stamped en-
velopes of that denomination were prepared, and
have been furnished to postmasters since the 1st
of July last.
Cancellation of Postage Stamps.
During the past year indelible canceling inks
have been used at the principal post offices, and
the employment of printing ink for cancellation
—the latter being much more difficult to efface
than ordinary writing ink-—has been continued a'
the smaller offices.
It is not believed that the Department has ever
suffered any considerable loss from the use of
washed or restored stamps, yet there has been a
constant endeavor, either by the introduction of
some effectual method of cancellation, or byape-
culiar process in the manufacture of the stamps,
to render impossible a second use thereof for the
payment of postage. No improvement of this
nature has yet been perfected, though much at-
tention has been given to the subject, and many
ingenious devices for this purpose invented, in-
struments for cancellation, with cuttingor abrad-
ing edges, have been submitted by various parties,
and upon hcin^; thoroughly tesnd wefrwml to
be inherently defective, owing to their liability
to injure, or to be injured by, the contents of let-
ters or packets. These instruments, furthermore,
speedily became dull or disarranged by ordinary
use,, requiring frequent sharpening or adjusting.
After much thought, and a thorough consider-
ation of the many instruments and devices which
have been submitted or suggested to the Depart-
ment to attain the desired result, the conclusion
has been reached that the only certain means of
effectual cancellation is in the preparation of the
stamps in such manner that, when once affixed to
a letter, they cannot be removed therefrom with-
out involving their destruction; or by their being
printed in colors sufficiently permanent to resist
the action of air and light, but whieh would read-
ily be effaced by any agent intended to remove
the canceling marks. Three varieties of postage
stamps, alleged to possess one or the other of these
qualities, have been submitted to the Department,
and their respective meritsare under consideration.
Losses of Postmasters from Robbery by Armed Men.
I beg leave to renew the recommendation made
in my last annual report, that special provision
be made by Congress authorizing the Postmaster
General to adjust and allow, upon the presenta-
tion of proper evidence of loss, the claims of such
postmasters as may have sustained losses of post-
age stamps and stamped envelopes by reason of
the occupation and robbery of their offices by
bodies of armed men. There have been reported
to the Departmentaboutone hundred cases of this
description, and the aggregate amount of claims
theieupon will not exceed §6,000. I us a circum-
stance worthy of consideration, that in most if
notin all of these instances these postmasters have
suifered greatly by the destruction of their private
property. The. Post Office Department, under
existing regulations, not having the authority to
make an allowance for the loss of public property
by robbery or theft, the only remedy is m the
hands of Congress.
' Theft of Stamps from Post Offices.
Additional legislation is also required in respect
to post office thefts. The stealing of postage
stamps from a post office is not made a felony un-
der any existing statute. Some months since
three persons were convicted in Indiana of the
l obbery of a post office in that State, and the steal-
ing of letters and a considerable amount of post-
age stamps. The former not leaving been proved
to contain "any article of value or evidence there-
of," and there being no penal enactment against
the taking of the latter, the parties were necessa-
rily sentenced to punishment for one of the slight-
est offenses against the postal laws, having been
each fined five dollars, and imprisoned three
months. 1 would suggest the establishment, by
statute, of a suitable penalty for offenses of this
nature. The best mode, perhaps, of attaining
this result would be the enactment of a law mak-
ing it a penal offense to steal from or forcibly en-
ter into any room or building which may, at the
time of such stealing or entry, be used or occu-
pied as a post office.
DEAD LETTERS.
Number of Dead Letters received.
The whole number of ordinary dead letters of
every description received and examined during
the year was 2,550,416, being 268,398 more than
in the preceding year.
Money and other Valuable Letters.
The number of these letters which contained
money was 18,527,and the value of their contents
was $77,861 31, showing an increase over the
number of letters of this class received during; the
previous year of 8,052, or 76 per cent., and an
increase in the amount of money inclosed of
$31,322 42, or 67 per cent.
Of these letters there were registered and mailed
for delivery to their respective owners during the
last fiscal vear 18,219, of which 15,048, contain-
ing £63,627 72, were finally delivered. To bring
a'Jout the latter result it was necessary to send
out many of these letters asecond time, and some
of them, in consequence of the owners' change of
residence, or for other cause, were sent out three
or four times in order to secure their restoration.
The numberof dead letters covering deeds,bills
of p\*?han<re, drafts, and other valuable papers,
