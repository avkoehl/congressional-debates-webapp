sion, which, extraordinary as it may been), consti-
tutes by far the most meagre and inconsiderable
portion of his speech The structuie he reared
with so much lafeor is composed of a little centre
building, of some twenty 01 thirty feet square, with
an extended wing on each side, and a huge portico
m front. I have, I trust, effectually demolished
the wings, and propose next to g  through the
same process with the centre bui'd rg.
As long as was the speech, tt contained but
three, or, at the utmost, four arguments, directly
applicable to the question under discussion, ol
which two have again and again been lepeated by
him every time he has addiessed the Senate, an-
othei was drawn from an argument of mine in la-
vor of the bill, which the Senator has misstated,
and pressed into his service against it, and the
other is neither altogethei new, nor very «ell
founded, or, from its character, of much force I
shall begin with it
The Senator objected to the collection of the pub-
lic dues m gold and silver, because, as he con-
ceives, it would be exceedingly inconvenient, in
proof of which, and m order to present as strong t
picture as possible, he went into minute calcul i-
Uons and details He first supposed that the avt-
rage peace revenue would be equal to tlnity mil-
lions annually, and iht average deposites lo twen
ty-one He then estimated thtt this east sum
would have to be counted at kast five tunes m the
year, <md then estimated that it would requira ei-dit
hundred thousand dollars to be counted daily,
which would require a host of officers, in his opi-
nion, to perioim the task The answer to all this
is easy In the fast pi ice, the Senttoi ¡its over-
estimated the average leeeipis. by at least one hun-
dred per cent Fifteen millions, oughl  > be much

m the other, the opponents ot the Govern iitnl, u>
far asits fiscal action was concerned, or, toeepre s it
moie coacise ly, when united with ihe Government,
they would be on the side of the tax-consumers,
and, when separated, on that of the taxpayers
Such were my reroaiks, and I now as i, is it nut
true? Can an) one deny it' Oi,admitting its (ruth,
can its importance be disputed1 Wen  there no
other reasons in favor of the bill, I would consitlei
this of Uselt decline ft would be almost impos-
sible to preserve our free institutions,  ith the
weight of ihe enute banking system thrown on
the side of high taxes and extravagant disburse-
ment^ or to destroy it if thrown into the opposite
scale
But the Senator regards the expression of tax-
consumers and tax-payers as mere catch-word's, of
dangerous impon, and tending to divide society in-
to the hostile parties of rich and pooi. I take a
veiy different view I hold that die fiscal action
oí iht Government nuin necessarily divide the
community into the two gieat classes of tax-payers
and tax-consumers. Taking taxation and disbuise-
meiits together, and it is nnav oielable that one pot-
tion oi ihe community must pay Into iheTreasmy,
in die shape of taxes, moie than they receive back
m disbursements, and anothet must receive more
than thev paj Tins is the great disturbing prin-
ciple in all Governments, especially those that are
iiee, aiound vv Inch all other causes of political di-
visions and distractions finally rally. Were it
otherwise, if Ihe inteiest of every portion and class
of die community was the same m íefcienee to
fixation anddisbuisemenls, nothing nould be more
easy than to establish and pieservefieeinstitutions,
but as it i , it is ilit most dillicult of all tasks, as

to pay gold and silver, which they had been wholly unaWe t 
redeem the eonaeejuence was, that there was a mass of paper
afloat, of perhaps fifty millions, which sustained no immediate
relation to the legal currency of the country—& paper which
will not enable any man to pay nieney he owes to hi neighbor
m his debts to the Government The banks had lesuecf more
moDt-v than Uiey could redeenij and the evil was severely felt,

prove lhat there was a depreciauon of the paper m circula-
tion, the legal standard of vaXt^t was gold and stiver,

In consequence of the immense paptr issues having banwbed
sptcieiiom circulation, the Government had been obliged, in
direot violation of existing statutes, to receive the amount of
tht ir taxes in something which -was not íecogmied by taw aa
the money of the country, and which was, m fact, greatly de
pretiattd, ott    This was the evil"
What can be more decisive? What more point-
ed? They aie the veiy doctrines which he is in the
daily habit of denouncing under the name of
Loco Poco. The Senator may hereafter be re-
garded afe the father of the party, and I deem it
not a little unnatural that he should be so harih
and cruel to his- offspring.
But it may be said, that I then advocated the op-
posite side Be it so, and it follows that his au-
thority and mine stand as opposing quantities on
the opposite side of an equation; and I feel confi-
dent that the Senator will readily admit that his
will at leabt be sufficient to destroy mine.
I readily acknowledge that my opinion, after the
lapse of upwards oí twenty years, with the light
which experience in this long period has shed on
the banking system, has undergone considerable
changes,. It would be strange if it had not. I see
more clearly now, than I did, the true character of
ihe system and its dangerous tendency, but I owe
it to myself and the truth of the case, to say I was,
even at that early period, far from being its advo-
cate, and would then have been opposed to the sys-
tem had it been a new question. But I then re-
garded the connection between the Government
and the banks indissoluble, and acquiesced in a
state of things lhat I could not control, and
which I considered as established. The Govern-
ment was then receiving the notes of non-specie
paying banks in its dues, to its own discredit and
heavy loss to its creditors The only practical al-
ternative was at that period between a league of
Stale banks and a Bank of the United States, as
the fiscal agent of the Government. I preferred
then, as I now do, the latter to the former, as more
ellicient and not a whit more unconstitutional, and,
if I now were again placed in the same slate oí
things thtt I then was, with all my present feelings
and views, I could hardly have acted differently
hum what 1 then did.
The Senator greatly mislakes, in supposing that
I feel any disposition to repudiate or retract what I
then said, ¿o far fiom it, I have, I think, just
cause to be proud of the lemarks I made on the oc-
casion it put the question of the bank, for the
fust time, on its true basis, as far as this Govern-
ment is concerned, and the one on which it has ever
since stooel, which is no small compliment to one
then so inexperienced as m} sell. All 1 insist on is,
that ihe íeport contains but a very hasty sketch—a
mere outline, as the reportei himself says—of my
remarks, jn which four-fifihs is omitted, and that ¡t
would be doing me great injustice to regard it as
containing a full exposition of my views. But, as
bnef as it is, what is reported cannot be read, in a
spirit of fairness, without seeing that I regarded the
question at the time as a mere practical one, to be
decided undei all the circumstances of the case,
without involving the higher questions which now,
that the connection between the Government and
the banks is broken, come rightfully into discus-
sion At that time the only question, as I expressly
stated, was, not whether we should be connected
with the bank, for that was existing in full foice,
but whether it was most advisable, admitting the
existence cf the connection, that the United States,
as well as the separate States, should exercise the
power ol banking I have made these remarks,
not that I regard the question of consistency, after
so great a change of circumstances, of much im-
portance, but because I desire to stand where truth
and justice place me on this great queslion.
The last argument of the Senator on the ques-
tion at issue was drawn from the provision of the
