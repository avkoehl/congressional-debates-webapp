HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, January 22, 1862.

Mrs. M. McREE.

MADAM: Your note is just received. In reference to the surgeons taken prisoners of war and now confined in McDowell's College permit me to say I unwittingly did them injustice in saying I was surprised they had not offered to attend their own sick. On inquiry I find they had done so before I was placed on duty in command of this district. Learning this fact I called upon them and arranged they should in conjunction with Doctor Marsh, surgeon of the Second Iowa Volunteers, discharge this duty. They will have every facility I can afford in the proper discharge of their duties.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SCHUYLER HAMILTON,

Brigadier General of Vols., U. S. Army, Commanding Saint Louis District.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, January 23, 1862.

SIR: I am directed by the Secretary of War to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant and to state in reply that early attention will be given to the condition of the soldiers now held as prisoners by the rebels.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
