BATTERY Numbers 2, May 22, 1864..

(Via Royall's).

Captain FEILDEN:

The enemy are still on Dixon's Island; four regiments can be seen. I think part of this force may have come this evening, though I cannot tell. They may attempt to repeat to-night the expedition of this morning. Such troops as you can well spare would like to keep.

Please answer.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

PICKET-LINE, GRIMBALL'S CAUSEWAY,

May 22, 1864-12 m. (Via Royall's House.)

General JONES:

The enemy still occupy the peninsula near Battery Island; their skirmishers along the creek the other side of this main island. Their gun-boat command the peninsula, and so to the guns on Long Island. It is possible that they are erecting batteries on Battery Island, and may be on the peninsula. Battery Island and the peninsula will be very difficult for us to hold as it is commanded, but I will try to drive them off this evening, if you think it best. Please answer at once.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, May 22, 1864-10 p. m.

Captain H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Jones' dispatch was received too late to make the demonstration directed. I have detained the troops. Will deploy them in the morning, and inform Major Pringle when the transportation will be needed for their return.
