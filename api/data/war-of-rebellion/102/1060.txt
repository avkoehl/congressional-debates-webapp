Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Laramie, Dak. Ter.:

Coach from the west has just arrived. Mr. Spotswood has withdrawn all the stage stock between Big Laramie and Fort Halleck, eighty miles. Declines to put it on unless there is a guard of thirty men to each station. I shall use every endeavor to keep the mails going with the use of Government mules and horses. Major Norton has received directions to open the road with his cavalry, and keep it open between Camp Collins and Fort Halleck. Major Norton, commanding Fort Collins, under date of July 4, reports that he ordered Company F, Eleventh Kansas Cavalry, to relieve the Ohio cavalry. This they positively refused to do, alleging they were out of the service. Company B offered to assist them in their mutiny. Company F finally concluded to go up the road when compelled to by men on duty at the Fort, threatening to return in two weeks. Company B is now at Fort Collins. Major Norton is up the road in person for the purpose of opening it.
