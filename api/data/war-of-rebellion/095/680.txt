station, however, I found that General Miles had, at about 3 o'clock, made a third and successful assault, striking the enemy's left flank and driving him out of his breat-works, taking one flag, two guns, and 600 prisoners. Brevet Brigadier-General Madill and Brevet Brigadier-General MacDougall, commanding Third and First Brigades,* were among the wounded, the former severely. Captain Clark's battery (B), First New Yersey, rendered great assistance in the assault by keeping up a vigorous and well-directed fire upon the enemy.
