IV. The general-in-chief will be with the left division of the Right Wing, or right division of the Left Wing, or as near the center of the army as possible, and will from time to time advise commanding officers of his whereabouts. He also expects the fllest possible reports of subordinate commanders. In the absence of specific orders the Right Wing will be the "column of direction," and will aim for Winnsborough Cheraw, Fayetteville, &amp;c.

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:

L. M. DAYTON.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

In the Field, February 16, 1865.

Major-General HOWARD:

DEAR GENERAL: I see the bridge over Broad burning. It is very important that you effect a crossing to-night. If necessary, get over the Saluda the bulk of the Fifteenth Corps, then take up enough pontoons to finish one across the Broad. Send an officer with the inclosed note to General Slocum, who can send youten before daylight. Slocum can cross Broad River as high up as Alston and thereby use his bridges at one day's interval.

Yours,W. T. SHERMAN.

Major-General.

Send the inclosed by an officer to conduct the pontoons.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, February 16, 1865.

Major-General SLOCUM:

GENERAL: General Howard has to pass Saluda and Broad Rivers at the same time, requiring more bridging than he has. I send this through him that he may note on it how many he wants. I suppose you can spare ten, as you will be able to remove that over the Saluda before you pass the Broad. In case Howard calls for any pontoons he will conduct them to the point where he needs them.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
