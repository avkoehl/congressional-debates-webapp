the country, and I commend it to this House.

' "Very few persons have a correct idea of the real
magnitude and value of the public domain or of the
necessity of grants oflands to railroads. From ignor-
ance* as well as depravity of mind, there has recently
been great opposition to railroad land grants, which
if not made will leave the Union Pacific railroad a
monopolist of the land route over the continent.
That, I am sure, is not desired by the people. The
case of the Government in relation to tbe public do-
main is precisely that of a farmer, who, with a large
farm, but far from market, is told by giving one acre
in thirty he can have a railroad through his farm to
market. That is the exact case. Is there a farmer
in the whole country who would hesitate a moment?
Suppose we were to doable that quantity for collat-
eral advantages, is there a farmer who would hesi-
tate? Now, the fact is that all the public lands
franted to the Union Pacific, and all asked for the
Forthorn and the Southern Pacific road*, do not
amount to a thirtieth part of the public domain.
Moreover, there is no possibility of getting actual
settler* on three fourths of the public domain with-
out railroads made by Government aid. Besides,
the Union Pacific does not go through the best lands
of the Government nor on the most favorable route.
I think I can give a brief digest of the facts regard-
ing the public lands, which is not given by the news-
papers. «nd is of much interest.
"1. Whatand whereaiethe public lands? Ishal{
not include Alaska, for I presumo it will be long
before any ono will want to buy land there. That
territory, however, includes nearly four hundred
million acre?. Nor shall I include the lands east
oftho Mississippi, where the Government still holds
sixty million acres. But from the Mississippi to
the JPacific, wheie railroads must bo made, the Gov-
ernment holds lands as follows:
A <; •«#.
1. Iowa, Missouri, and Aikansas* 16,000.000
2. Dakota and Wyoming 145,295.284
3. Montana  86,904,(505
4. Kansas  43.148,870
5. Nebraska  42.523 G27
0. Colorado and Idaho 117,800,000
7. New Mexico and Utah 124.140,000
8. Nevada and Arizona 1&>,000,000
9. Minnesota  3(5,776.170
10. California, Oregon, aud Washington 201,0u0,000
11. Indiana 44154.000
Aggregate west of the Mississippi.....993,742,062
"There are. in round numbers, one thousand mil-
lion acres of th« public domain between the Missis-
sippi and the Pacific. If the Government grant to
the Northern and Southern Pacific railroads (and to
the former its grant is made equitably, and it would
be a want ol good laith to refuse it) tor three thou-
sand miles, at twenty sections, twolve thousand eight
hundred acres per mile, the whole amount would bo
thirty-eight million four hundred thousand, a frac-
tiou over a thirtieth part. Double this and the Gov-
ernmentwill bo immensely tho gainer, and it is tho
only mode by which these lands can ever be seMlud.
"2. A very largo portion of these lands,especially
thopo on tho i on to of tho Northern Pacific, arc rich and
arable. In Minnesotaand Dakota there are nearly
two hundred million acres of pub!io lands, two thirds
of which lie on the direct line from Lake Superior
to tho Rocky mountains, in Montana. Hero it is
generally a high plain, fertile in soil, admirably
watered, and producing tho best oi grapes and small
grain. In Montana, also, thero arc many valuable
lands. I shall say nothing of that vast and fertile
tract which lies north of this in British America, and
•which is hereafter to be added to the United States.
Let that Question pass into the future; but it is evi-
dent to all observing minds that through that im-
xnenso and to a great extent arable country, there
must be railroads, which can only bo mado, for a
long time, by Government aid. Now, it will be ob-
served that the whole vast domain I havo described
is unsold and unappropriated.
"3. Let us now look at the manner in which the
public lands havo recently been distributed. It
happens unlortunately that our Government print-
ing is always so fur behind that it is impossible to
get the official reports till two years after they are
made; but I will take 18G6 and 18(37 as examples.
Tho Oommisdioner of the Land Office makes the fol-
lowing report of lands disposed of:

%"I presume tho lands taken for roads were only
those for which deeds were made at the time; not to
grants innde bylaw, to take place in future. The
above table presents some cuiious facts. First, wo
seethe actual settlement, of the land is rapidly in-
creasing, for the amount disposed of in 1867 was fifty

per cent, greater than in 1866. Next, we observe
that the largest quantity is taken under the home-
stead act. Is there not a good deal of speculation
under tbat? But, strange to say, the next largest
quantity is under the agricultural college scrip. I
regard that as one of the greatest humbugs I know
of. How can you make a Jarmer or a carpenter by a
college? West Point costs about two hundred thou-
sand dollars per annum, and turns out about forty
graduates each year, who are practically the best edu-
cated men in America. The agricu1 tural coll eges will
cost fivefold as much, and educate nobody. But let us
proceed. The public lands have been the greatout-
let for the overflowing population of the country
and the ambitious politicians. They have operated
as a national sewerage. What will happen when the
sewerage is gone? But, in the mean time, the public
lands have been tho inducement to the vast, flowing,
impulsive, aggregating people, from everyclimeand
nation, who have gone and are going west of the
Mississippi. I present below somo of the probable
results ot the census of 1870, compared with that of
1860 :
In 1860. In 1870.

Iowa  674,943 1,100.000

ton   429,122 1,000,000
Aggregate   3.197,562 5,530.000
"If this estimate be correct, the population west
of the Mississippi is now greater than that of the
whole United States in 1800, and is increasing at the
rate of seventy per cent, per annum. It isalso plain
that tho northern rim is increasing at the greatest
ratio. In tho vast country which lies between the
forty-second and forty-ninth degrees, there is a coun-
try very productive of grass and small grains, al-
though corn will never be very abundant there. The
center of the corn region will always be in tho Ohio
valley.
" In the brief tables above, the reader will get a
comprehensive view of the magnitude of our jpublic
domain and of tho true mode ot improving it. If
we suppose the grants made to all the Pacific and
other railroads to be one hundred and twenty million
acres, there will remain eight hundred and seventv-
threo million acres unsold and unappropriated. In
1867 we consumed seven millions,and at that rate it
will take ono hundred and twenty-five years to use
up all; or. taking out uncultivatabe lands, ono hun-
dred years. In the meanwhile wo shall annex half
of what remains in America, especially the wild
lands, so that wo need not be nlarmed for want of
land. No pent-up Utica confines us, no narrow
river limits our ambition, till the vast continent is
embraced by the Anglo-American."
The foregoing figures havo been changed by
recent dispositions of land by the Government,
yet the proportion remains materially the same.
And yet, sir, in the face of these facts and
figures, gentlemen tell us that all this public
domain should be reserved for the next gen-
eration, in order to make them rich and pros-
perous. Let us live poor, that posterity may
grow rich on the hidden treasures and great
resources of the nation, which the present age
has suffered to lie dormant for want of proper
legislation to develop them. Sir, it is a new
rule in the law of political economy, and reads
like modern Democracy, and I entertain fearful
apprehensions that we have a political party
averse to everything that tends to the promo
tion and prosperity of this nation, strictly a
party of negations, opposed to everything and
in favor of nothing practical, whose highest
ambition is to throw impediments in the way
of progressive legislation aud retard the public
improvements of the country. It crops out too
often to escape the attention of gentlemen on
this floor, and is fully evinced by the augry
retort which characterizes the discussion of all
political issues.
Sir, my earliest recollections of the political
agitations in this country are associated with
Democratic opposition to the liberal policy of
"internal improvements by the General Gov-
ernment" and the giving away of the public
domain. And although' that liberal policy
has been pursued by the Government toward
certain sections of the country, yet we have
increased in population rapidly and accommo-
dated an unparalleled influx of emigration; and
still we have a vast and almost unbounded terri-
H
tory, but recently explored, entirely worthless
in its present condition, but which contains
a vast portion of the hidden wealth of the
nation, and yet we are told that it should be
reserved for posterity.
Sir, the whole secret is- opposition to every-
thing that tends to promote the interest of the
country under the present Administration, and
at every point of progress we meet the special
plea of some self-constituted guardian ad litem
for posterity j and while they complain that the
present age refuse to award them a just meed
of praise, yet they may indulge the fond hope
that they may live to enjoy the day when pos-
terity will extol their many virtues. Yet we
may as well expect they will grow gray in
persistent opposition to progress and all that
is calculated to promote the interest of the
country.
Under the baneful influence of the destruc-
tive theories and corrupt practices of modern
Democracy all the material prosperity of a
once happy country has withered and died.
Now they attempt to wrest the reins of gov-
ernment from the Republican party, and prom-
ise to rebuild what they have destroyed. It
surpasses Satan for impudence, and bears off
the palm for stupidity. If you wait for them
to exhibit the first sign of political virtue you
will see the sun go down on the dial of Ahaz.
Pensions.
REMARKS OF HON. W. LAWRENCE,
of oiiio,
In the House of Representatives,
March 3, 1871,
On the bill (II. R. No. 2892) to provide a mode of
paying pensions.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, during
tbe last session of Congress I gave my opinions
at considerable length on several occasions on
the subject of the proper mode of paying pen-
sions. Congress did not pass the bill 1 intro-
duced, but some of the reforms I suggested
were incorporated in a bill which became a
law. The observations I have been able to
make since that time have more and more
confirmed me in the opinion that a radical
reform should be made in the mode of paying
pensions. I do not propose to discuss the
subject further now than to say I introduced a
bill in this House on the 30th of*January last
to provide a mode of paying pensions which I
believe would, if passed into a law, be benefi-
cial in its results. And I desire to place on
record this bill, which is as follows :
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives oj (he United States of America in Congress assem-
bled, That after tho — day of  , 1871, all pen-
sions shall be payable quarterly, commencing on the
— day of , 1871, or semi-annually to pension-
ers who may so elect, by a proper check, drawn and
signed by the Commissioner of Pensions, or a clerk
by him designated, on an Assistant Treasurer, or a
national bank designated as a public depositary,
and payable, in every case, to the order of the pen-
sioner entitled thereto, or to the guardian of any
pensioner under legal disability; but pensions to
persons in foreign countries may be paid according
to existing laws; and at or before the close of each
quarter such check for each pensioner or guardian
of a pensioner shall be transmitted to the postmas-
ter at tho post office nearest or most conveniently
accessible to said pensioner or guardian, accom-
panied with a proper voucher in brief form, with
instructions for the execution thereof. And it shall
be the duty of such postmaster or his special
deputy designated for the purpose to deliver such
check to the pensioner or guardian entitled thereto,
on the execution of such voucher, verified by
an oath ot identity, to be administered by such
postmaster or deputy, who shall certify the same,
and that ho is fully satisfied of the truth of the
statements contained, which vouchers shall be
transmitted to tho proper accounting officer of the
Treasury Department; and such postmaster or
deputy shall be authorized to administer all oaths,
and to examine such witnesses, and to do such
other acts as may be necessary for the carrying out
of said instructions. And in case of the death or re-
moval to parts unknown, or criminal or fraudulent
conduct, or change of condition of any pensioner or
