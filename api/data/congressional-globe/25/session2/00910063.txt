Mr HOWARD asked if he should tfe'-p-'bs be
jond the endurance ai d patience of the House, -f
} e were to say 4 few words more upon a subject of
which, he was aware, they were heartily tired He
had been dragged into the debate, which was, en-
tirely irregular Unwilling to gncroaeh upon the
rules of order, he felt himself continually fettered
m his lemarks, b> bew«- obliged to keep constantly
p-es ut to In-, mird ¡he conformity of what he
was about to say with the rules of tne House
But he was conutra ned to refer again to wnJ,
he had said, m prder that his exact position
might not- be mistaken The firs' debate oc-
curred in this House oh Monday, the eighteenth
instant, a summaiy of which was published
on the next morning, m one of the daily papers, of
this city, and commented coon on Wednesday the
aota In thecourse of thai week- he (Mr EL) had
sattsfed himself, -upon due inquiry, that no prop >-
sition of reference had been made r-y the Mexican
to the AmetícaajGroVcrnment, upr had, the deciee
of the Congress of the former been communi-
cated in any oÉcial shape whatever When
the debate was renewed on Tuesday, the 26th,
he had stated this tp the Blouse. But he
was afterwards informed that a commmuni-
catien from the Meilean Miaster-, dated on
the 23d, at Philadelphia, had been recetW
at the ftepartmenl of State, enclosing a copy
of the decree Without stopping to comment u* on
the expedition with \ihiCh this communication fol-

posMbiiit), that he should oi ih" 26ih oe acquaint-

paper, da«-d on the 23d, at Philadelphia He now
asserted that he was tota'ly ignorant of both But,
as soon as he wa^ informed thereof, he determined
to state what he knew to tne House, although he
was perfectly aware of the irregularity of such a
proceeding. He desired that ao person might
ever hare the slightest ground or pretext for saying
or thinking, that he tampered with a body which
he held in sueh enure respect, and therefore he had
felt it a duty to. fee House as well as himself,
to- pursue   the   only-   coarse   which  was  open

whether the power to make the pioposition of rt*

commuted to such a course by the repoit which he

ness with which the honorable gentleman seemed
inclined to examine it, he would have heea mere
careful 11 its prepaiation , for it was wiittei in one
evening, in the interval betwsen dark and bed time
But he was willing to stand upon it as it was, and
defied critici-.ni He knew that it expre s^d his
honest sentiments, and would abide by them He
had made up his mind to two propositions. The first
was, that peace was the settled policy of this nation,
for all ourmstuutions weie founded upon tins theory
War is an unnatural and forced position As long as
it was possible to preset ve peace, without sacrific-
ing the rights or honor of the nation, he would
struggle to niiimtdm it We held in our hands
the destinies of a great people, and must not rashly
or lightly put them in jeopardy This was hi 
fiist pioposition His oecondwas, that the Ame-
rican nation cherished a lofty sense of honor,
and. would  not only justify, but require their

by the injustice of any foreign power to seek
