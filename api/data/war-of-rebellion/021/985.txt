HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WESTERN LOUISIANA,Alexandria, February 19, 1863.

Major General J. B. MAGRUDER,

Commanding District of Texas, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Yours of the 5th ultimo has this moment reached me. Although I supposed you had detained Sibley's brigade, I did not speak or even think of your action harshly. Your glorious achievement at Galveston has found no admirer warmer than I.

You will be pleased to learn that we have captured the formidable ram which lately ran our batteries at Vicksburg. She will leave this to-day ready for action. She mounts seven guns, some heavy Parrots. She was taken great pleasure in forwarding the documents.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General, Commanding.
