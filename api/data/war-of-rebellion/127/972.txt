Third. It is impossible to state what arms "are in possession of the armies in the field and not in the hands of the soldiers. " The number varies every morning in every regiment, according to the discharges, furloughs, returns, and enlistments of men during the day.

At this moment especially would it be impracticable even to approximate the number, while men are leaving in large numbers on re-enlistment or furloughs, and others are returning in charge of the recruiting officers, scattered all over the country under the recent recruiting laws.

Chairman of the Senate, Virginia:

SIR: I have the honor to respond to the resolution of your committee as follows:
