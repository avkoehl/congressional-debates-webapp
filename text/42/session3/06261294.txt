THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 12,
Mr. CLAYTON. It will take but a minute.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion?
Mr. SPRAGUE. I object.
Mr, CLAYTON. I want to correct a mis-
statement.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Rhode Island objects.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. The Senator
from Arkansas wishes to correct a misstate-
ment of his own. I hope nobody will object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island withdraw his objec-
tion to the Senator from Arkansas correcting
a misstatement of his own 1
Mr. SPRAGUE. I withdraw the objection.
Mr. CLAYTON. While the question was
up as to the seal which was upon the certificate
from Arkansas I gave it as my opinion that
that was the seal of the State. I have since
examined the seal on the credentials of Mr.
Dorsey, and I find that I was mistaken ; that
this is the seal of the secretary of State, and
not the seal of the State.
Mr. SCOTT. I move that the House be
informed that the Senate have decided the
question.
The VICE PRESIDENT. As soon as the
, Chair announced the last vote, the Secretary
left the door of the Senate to go to the House to
communicate the action of the Senate.
A message was received from the House of
Representatives, by Mr. McPherson, its Clerk,
.announcing that the House had passed the
. following resolution:
Resolved, That the electoral vote of the State of
Arkansas as reported by the tellers be counted.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I move, if it be in order,
that the Senate take a recess for five minutes.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The rule pro-
videsâ€”
" Such joint meeting shall not bo dissolved until the
electoral votes aro all counted and the result de-
clared; and no recess shall be taken unless a ques-
, tion shall have arisen in regard to counting any of
suoh votes, in which case it shall bo competent for
either House, acting separately, in the manner
hereinbefore provided, to direct a recess not beyond
the next day at the hour of one o'clock p. m."
The Senator from Vermont moves that the
Senate takes a recess for five minutes.
Mr. CONKLING. Is it not by concurrent
resolution that that must be done 1
The VICE PRESIDENT. The rule is
specifically the other way. The Chair will
again read it:
" In which case it shall be competent for either
House, acting separately, in the manner hereinbefore
provided, to diireet a recess not beyond the next day
at the hour of one o'clock p. m."
The question is on the motion of the Sen-
ator from Vermont, that the Senate now take a
recess for five minutes.
_ The motion was agreed to; and at the ex-
piration of the recess the Senate resumed its
session, when the following message was re-
ceived from the House of Representatives by
Mr. McPherson, its Clerk:
Mr. President, the House of Represent-
atives have passed the following resolution:
Resolved, Thatin the judgment ofthe House, none
of the returns reported by the tellers as electoral
votes of the State of Louisiana should be counted.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the Senate
now return to the Hall of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
(at seven o'elock and forty-six minutes p. m.)
again proceeded to the Hall of the House of
Representatives.
The Senate returned to its Chamber at eight
o'clock ana five minutes p. m.

The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate re-
sumes its session. The naval appropriation
bill is before the Senate, but the Chair asks
consent to submit the Army appropriation bill
for reference.

3850) making appropriations for the support
oftheArmy for the yearending June 30,1874,
was read twice by its title, and referred to the
Committee on Appropriations.

Senate be appointed by this body to join a commit-
tee of two members of the House of Representa-
tives, to be appointed by that House, to wait on
Ulysses S. Grant, of Illinois, and to notify him
that he has been duly elected President of the Uni-
ted States for four years, commencing on the 4th
day of March, 1873; and also to notify Henry Wil-
son, of Massachusetts, that he has been duly elected
Vice President of the United States for four years,
commencing on the 4th day of March, 1873.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. How shall the
committee be appointed?
Mr. EDMUNDS. By the Chair.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, that will be regarded as the sense of
the Senate, and the Chair appoints the Sen-
ator from Ohio, [Mr. Sherman.]

do now adjourn.
