The general commanding directs that Captain Hagans shall send a reconnoitering party of one commissioned officer and twenty men, mounted, with three days' rations, toward Huttonsville, going to that place if practicable.

BALTIMORE, MD., January 20, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Wheeling, W. Va.:

The stables at Monrovia are now used by the artillery horses, and ought not to be destroyed. The quartermaster who informed you that there was no use for them was mistaken. One of the stables at Monocacy was destroyed before it was reported to me. I will take the lumber from your men and rebuilt at once. Respectfully request that you revoke the order to destroy the stables at Monrovia.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General of Volunteers.

BALTIMORE, MD., January 20, 1865.

Brigadier General E. B. TYLER,

Relay House, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad:

General Sheridan orders the destruction of the stables at Monocacy stopped; take the lumber and rebuild the one destroyed. He says that he ordered those at Monrovia destroyed, but do not permit it until further orders from here, as General Sheridan has been requested to revoke the order.
