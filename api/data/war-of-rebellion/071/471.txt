(Received 3 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Washington:

My iron-clads patrolled the railroad yesterday to within a few miles of Martinsburg. Road yet safe west of that point. If General Hunter is able to take the offensive, I can protect the road west of North Mountain. If not, my force is too small and scattered to resist any considerable movement of the enemy this way.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Cumberland, Md.:

With your railroad facilities you should be able to concentrate nearly all your force on any threatened point. You will be expected to make your arrangements to accomplish this object.
