CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tatoty and permanency m any system of govern- 1
mental po cy are, in all respects, eminently desi
lable, but more particularly is this rue in all that
affect  ttade md commerce, the operations of
wh ch depend mtch more on the eeitamty of their
returns, and calcaiations which embrace distant
periods of time, th«n on higa bounties, or duties,
which are liable to connant fluctuations.
At yojr late session, I invited ye ur attention to
the condition oí the currency and exchanges and
urged the neecessi y of adopting such measures a*
wsre consistent with the constitutional cornpe.ency
of the Government, in order to correct the un-
soundne.s of the one, andas far as practicable the
inequalities of the o her. No country can be in th*>
enjo} ment of ¡is full measure of prosperity, With-
out the presence of a medium of exchange ap
pioximating to uniformity of value What is ne-
cessary as between the different nations ot the
earth, is also important as between ihe inhabitants
of d'fferent parts of the same countrj;with the
first, the precious metals constitute the chief me
dium of ci'cu anon, and tuch also would be the
ca«e as to ¡he last, but for inventions compara-
tively modern, which have furnished, in place of
gold and silver, a paper Circulati >n. I do not
piopose to enter into a compara ive anahsis of
the merits of the two systems Such belonged
more preperly to 'he period of the introduction of
the paper system. The speculative philosopher
might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry,
but bis researches could only lead him to conclude
that the paper sjstem had probably better never
have been introduced, and that society might have
been much happier without it. The practical
statesman has a very different ta«k to perform.
He lias to look at things as taey are—to take
them as he f'nds them— o supply Deficiencies, and
to prune excesses as far as in him lies Tt-c task
of furnishing a eoiactive for derangements of the
paper medium with us, is almost inexpressibly
great. The power exerted by the States to charter
banking corporations, and which, having been ear-
ned to a great exceis, hrs filled the country with, in
mo3t of the States, an irredeemable paper medium,
is an an evil which, in some way or other, re-
quires a corrective. The rates at which bills of
exchange are negotiated between different parts of
the country, furnish an index of the value of the
local substitute (or gold and silvei, which is, in
many part , so tar depreciated as not to be re-
ceived, excep" at a large discount, m payment of
debt, or in the purchase of produce It could ear-
nestly be desired that every ban i, not possessing
the means oí resump'ion, should follow the exam-
ple of Ibe late Umtet' S'a rs B?nk of Pennsylvania,
and go into 1 quidauoB, ra her than by refusing to
do so, to continue embarrassments in the Wfcy of
solvent institution, ihe'eby augmenting the diffi-
culties incident to the present condi ion of things.
Whether this Government, with due rfgard to the
rights of the States, has any power to constrain the
banks, either to resume specie payments or to force
them into liquidation, is an inquiry which will not
fail to claim your consideration. In vie* of the
great advantages which are allon\J the corpora-
tors, no' aiiong the l°ast oí which is the authority
coot? ned in most of their coartéis, to make Joans
to three tirpes the p^iount ot their cap tal thereby
often deriving three times as much jti'e-est ob the
same amount <f noney as any individual is per-
mitted by law to receive, no si-fjicient apo'ogycdii
be ntged for a long coiumued suspens <n of specie
pavment* Such suspenuon is j reductive oí the
greatest detr nieit to the pab) •*, by exnellirg fom
circulation the precious metáis, and 'enou ly ha-
zarding the s jece«s of any effort that tl j« Gt vern-
ment can make, tómete st coi"rrtrcial facilities,
and to advance the pub ic interes's
This is the more to be r gre ted, and the mdis-
pensab'e necessity for a sound currency becomes
the more manifest, when ve reflect m the vast
amonnt of the m ernal cciui^rce of he country
Of this we hove no s'a'istics ror just ''ata for
forming adequate ommors. But tlw can be do
doutt but that the amount of t asportation coast,
wise by s a, and the 'r, nsportatio<i inland *-y raí 
roa'saiw canals and by *teatnUats and other
mocks of conveyance, over the surface of our vast
rivers and immense lakes, and tbe value of pro-
perty can ed and interchanged by the^e means,
form a general aggregate to which the foreign com-
merce of the country, large as it is, makes but a
distant approach.
In the absence of any controlling power over lav
subject, which by forcing a general resumption of
specie payments ivould at once have tbe effect of
restoring a sound medium of exchange, and would
leave to the country but little to desire, what mea-
sure of relief, falling within the limits of our con-
stitutional competency, does it become this Go
vernmeni to adopt' It was my painful duty at
your last session, under the weight of most solemn
obligations, 10 differ with Congress on the mea-
sures which it proposed for my approval, and
whuh it doubtless regarded as corrective of exist-
ing evils Subsequent reflection, and events since
occurring, have only served to confirm me in the
opinions then entertained, and frankly expressed
I must be permitted to add, that no scheme of
Governmental policy, unaided by individual exer-
tions, cail be available for ameliorating the present
condition of things Commercial modes of ex-
change ard a good currency, are but the necessary
medns of commerce and intercourse, not the direct
productive sourc-- of wealth Wealth can only
be accumula ed by the earnings of mdusry and
the savings of frugality, and nothing can be more
ü'-judged ihan to look to facilities in borrowing,
cr to a redundant circulation, for the power of dis-
charging pecuniary obligat ons The country is
full of resources and lh« people full of energy, and
the great and permanent remedy for present em-
barrassmen s must be sought in industry, eco-
nomy, the observance of good faitb, ?nd the favo-
rable influence of ume.
In pursuance ot a pledge givfn to you in my
last message to Congress, which pledge I urge as
an apology for adventuring to present you the de-
tails of any plan, the Secretary of the Treasury
will be ready to submit to you, should you require
it, a plan of finance which, while it throws around
the public treasure reasonable guards for its pro-
tec'ion, aid rects on powers acknowledged in prac-
tice to exist from the origin of the Government,
will, at the same time, furnish to the country a
sound paper medium, and afford all reasonable fa-
cilities for regulating the exchanges "When sub-
muted, you will perceive in it a plan amendatory
of the existing laws ra relation to the Treasury
Department—subordinate m all respects to the will
of Congress directly, and the will of the people in-
directly—self sustaining, should it be found mprac-
t re to realize i!s promises in theory, and repeala-
ble at the pleasure of Congress It proposes by
effectual restraints, and by invoking the true spirit
of our institutions, to separate the purse from the
sword, or more nroperiy to speak, denies any
other control to the President over the age it  who
may be selected to c^rry it into execution, but what
may be 'rjdisp nspbly necessary to secure the fide-
bty of such agents, and, b/ wise regulations, keeps
plainly apart from each other private and public
funds It c mtemplates the establishment of a
Board of Comioj at the seat of Government, wi h
agencies at pi or  ment commercial prints, or where-
ver else Congr  s sbaij direc', for the safekeeping

dition, that i s exercise shall not be prchibied by

In orair to cover the expenses incident U tae
plan, it will be authorized to receive moderate pre-
miums for certificates issued on deposites, and on
bills bought and 'old, and thus, as far a? its deal-
ings extend, to furnish facilities to commercial m-
ercourse at'the lowest possible rates, and to sub
duct from the earnings of industry the least possible
sum It uses the State banks at a distance from the
agencies as auxiliaries, without imparting any
po*er to trade in its name It is subjected to such
guards and restraints as have appeared to be neces
sary. It is the creature of law, ana exists only at
the pleasure of the legislature It is made to rest
on an actual specie basis, in order to redeem
the notes at the places of issue—produces no dan-
gerous redundancy of circulation—affords no
temptation to speculation—is attended by no infla-
tion of prices—is equable in its operation—makes
the Treasury notes, which it may tse along with
the certificates of deposite, and the notes of specie-
paying banks, convertible at the place ^here col-
lected, receivable in payment of Government dues,
and, without violating any principle of the Con-
stuution, affords the Government and the people
such facilities asare called for by the wants of
toib Such, it has appeared to me, are its recom-
mendations, and in view of them it will be submit-
ted, whenever j ou may require it, to >our conside-
ration
I am not able to perceive that any fair and can-
did objection can be urged against the plan, the
pnnc pal outlines of which 1 have thus presented.
I cannot doubt but that the notes which it proposes
to furnish, at the voluntary eption of the public
creditor, usued in lieu of tbe revenue and its certi-
ficates of deposite, will be maintained at an equa-
lity with gold and stiver every where They are
redeemable in gold ?n 1 silver on demand, at the
places of issue They are receivable every where
inpayment of Governmint due The Treasury
no'es are limited to an amount of one-fourth less
than tbe estimated annual receipts of the Treasury,
and in addition, they rest upon the faith of the Go-
vernment for their redemption If all these assu-
rances are not sufficient to make them available,
then the idea, as it seems to me, of furnishing a
sound paper medium of exchanges, may be entirely
abandoned.
If a fear be indulged that the Government may
be tempted to run into excess in its issues at any
future day, it seems to me that no such apprehen-
sion can reasonably be entertained, until a 1 confi-
dence in the representatives of the States and of
the people, as well as of the people themselves,
shall be lost. Trie weightiest considerations of po-
licy require that the restraints now proposed to be
thrown arouná the measure should not, for light
causes, be removed. To argue against any pro-
peed plan lis liability to possible aba«e, is to re-
ject every expedient, since every thing dep°ndent
on human act on u liable io abuse Fifteen mil-
lions of Treasury notes may be ssued as the max-
irnum, bur a discretionary power is to be given to
tbe Board of Control, under that sum, and every
consideration will unite in leading them to feel
their way with caution For the eight firs' years of
the existence of the late Bank of the United s ates,
its circulation barely exceeded $4 000,000, anr for
five of its most prosperous years, it was about equal
to $16,000,000. Furthermore, the authority given
to receive puvate deposites to a 1 mited amount,
and to issue certifica es m such sums ?s may be
called for by the dtpisitor , nuy so far fill up the
channels of circulali in as gr'atly to dimmish the
neceosity c£ any considerable is<u-- of Treasury
notes A restraint upon he amount of private de-
posites has seemed to be md'spen^aoly necessary,
from an ppprehension, though to be «eU founded,
that m ?ny emergency of trade, confidence m gbt
be so far shaken in the bank^ as to induce a with-
drawal from ibein of private deposites ¡with a vietv
to ensure their unquestionable, safety when dtpo
i ed with the Government, which might prove
eminently disastrous to the State banks Is it ob
jectej thaf it is p'opo d to authorise the agencies
to deal in bills of exchange' It is answered that
such dealings «re to be carr ed on at ihe lowest pos-
sible premium—are made to rest on au unquestion-
ably seund basis—are designed to reimburse merely
the expenses which w/mld otherwise devolve upon
the Treasury, and are in strict babordinatioa to the
