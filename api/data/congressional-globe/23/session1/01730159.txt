THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

a sense of duty, to oppose their claims to be put
on the pension list, for how much or how justly
their sympathies might be raised in their favor, he
must maintain that such feelngssliould not be per-
mitted to prevail or be exercised in legislation, un-
less in cases that were c'early on the s de of right
This House weie guardians of the public treasure,
and if they did not strictly regard the right of all
claims to i', they must be deemed faithless to their
trust if they did not, what security had the country
against that extravagance and prodigality whicn
would inevitably prevail, and which at once dis-
graced and corrupted theircitizens' He considered
that all claims of this nature ought to be viewed m
the nature of a contract made by the soldier wi'h
the Government, who, when he got what the Gov-
ernment undertook to give him for his services, he
could not reasonably complain, unless in peculiar
cases of disability, by wounds received whilst em-
ployed in the service So fai he would go, but
could not go beyond that If they did, they would
increase the present list, and thus waste the public
treasure Having these views, he could not even
vote for the resolution of inquiry, lest from so
voting it might be deemed an evidence of his mten
tion to vote for the extension of the system itself,
and thus he might be charged with raising expect-
ations which in all probability would not be real-
ized He could not see how it v/as possible for
them to ascertain the numbeis who could—taking
foi granted the justice of their claims to be placed
on the roll—be considered entitled to this He
could not understand the principle upon which it
could be maintained that Congresahad the light in
the case of those persons engaged in the Indian
warfare, although it was alleged that Congress,
having the right to declare war and raise armies,
the light to grant pensions was tobe implied But
this power extended only to those soldiers so I
engaged, in consequence of the terms upon which
they might be engaged in the service The
instance, then, of the pensions formerly granted
to the soldiers of the Revolution ought not to be
leferred to as a precedent to govern their decision
unon this question,but should rather opera e as a
beacon to warn them of its dangerous con«e
quences The persons engaged in those wars were
not engaged as the soldiers of the Resolution weie,
fighting on the side of principle, they fought not
for themselves alone, but to give libeity and inde-
pendence to every American citizen 1 hey fought
against a foteign Government which aspired to
govern this exclusively They fought, too, not
under leaders and banners of then own, but undei
the orders of an organized Government, under pri
vations of no common character, and received for
their services a depreciated curiency
The officeis and soldiers of the Revolution have
claims for services winch they had tendered with
out pay, they claimed thejus ice, not the bounty
of Congiess Gentlemen of legal abil ty, n both
Houses of Congress, advocate-t the bill gramil g
pension!  to tnose men, as a competían on for sei
vices, which compensation had been promised and
wi hheld The claim was both advocated and
allowed as a matter of right Not such was the
character of the claims now presented Mucn as
he íespected *he men who fought after the treaty
of peace, he must say that they did not present a
case which called foi the bounty of the Govern-
ment They were paid in good money, dollar
for dolku, the whole sum which the Government
promised them They fought, too, not foi the
independence of the country, for that was secured
It was certainly never apprehended that the In-
dians would reconquer America Where would
the system stop, ii we went to the extent pro
pos°d! Would not the officers and sok'iers who
were engaged in the late war v/i h Great Bi nam be
equally well enti'led to military reivaids Tney
rendered meritorious «ervices on-the land and on
the sea Why not go back to the Indian wiis
preceding the Revol uion,and pension tho«e who
vere engaged m them, or their surviving repre
sei tativet, ' Some of those wars were of ar exten-
sive lange, along the whole northern and western
frontieis He íeferred particulaily to the wars
grow n  out of the v/ai between Fiance and Eng-
land in llio Thepioneei settlers and the militia
who engiged m them, received no compensation
foi their services, thoj^h they suffered the greatest
pn/sHons in piotecurg the frontier settlements
But they participated in tne benefits resulting from
the contests, and were thus rewaided for their ser-
vices He could not see any reason why the sys
tem should be confined to military services If we
went on, we should find strong arguments in favor
of pensioning those who had rendered mpo tant
civil services But he was not in favor of extend
mg the system, on the cortrary, he thought that
this was the proper time for fixing its limits to
those engaged m the revolutionary contest Past
experience had shown that the estimates of the
expendituies under this system had always fallen
short of the íeal amount We were told, when
the present pension act was before the House,
that the number of applicants would not exceed
seven or eight thousand But it appears that the
number was 30,625 He went into some state
ments of the sums which the pension system had
cost us—amounting, altogether, to twenty six mil
lions of dollars
The state of the Treasui y would not wai rant an
extension of the system The present Admmis
tration came into power upon the principle of re-
trenchment, but it had gone on increasing the ex-
penses instead of reducing then The Secretary
of the Treasury now cautions us to be economical,
least we shou'd exceed the means of the Go vein
ment The revenue expected for the next year
would not exceed the necessary expenses of the
Government
Here Mr C was obliged to suspend his remarks
on account of the expiration of the hour
REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
motion to refer the report of the Secretary of the
fieasuryon the deposites to the Committee of
Ways and Means—the question being on the
amendment submitted by Mi Jones, asanamend-
ment to that pieviously submitted by Mr Mc
Duffie, viz to add to the motion for reference the
following mstiuclions to that committee "Inqui-e
' into the expediency of depositing the revenue
1 heieafter collected in the State banks m the dif-
1 ferent States where the same is collected, m pro
' portion to their respective capitals paid in, and to
' prescribe the terms on which the same shall be
' deposited, and to íeport by bill oi otherwise "
Mr PEYTON resumed his remaiks Every
one (he said) must be aware that the piesent ex
citement against the President did not grow out of
the removal of the deposites That act was seised
upon by the party leaders, to inflame the minds of
the people, and to promote their changes of success
in the deep game'they weie playing The party
was led by some of the lughe t older of talent,
who were united by the common tie of disappoint
ed ambition One obstacle stood in their way—a
man of stern integrity and inflDxib!e oatnotism
stood as \ pillar of the State That pillar was to
be overthrown, no' by the removal of the depos-
ites, but by a continued and organized system of
slander and abuse and agitation All efforts were
dnected to one object—to hold up the President as
a tyrant, to íesist whom wi'l be patriotism
Weaie taunted as a drilled majority When
gentlemen ta k of the exeicis o majority poweis j
they ceitainly forget examples which they left
behind them at home Where has the majority-
power fallen, m this country, wi h the heaviest
hand' Where have patrios of the Revolution, I
and thousands of woithy and estimable citizens,
been disfranchised and debarred from all the priv
lieges of cit zenship, for op'mon's sake' It was
in that State where the majority imposed upon
e\ery citizen the test oath A dark c'oud lowers
o%er our horizon, and we hear the muttennff of
d «taut tnuiidet Where was the bolt to fall ' He
would hi e to know one thing Ir, m the coming
storm, the Administration and its fnends should
be overwhelmed and destioyfd, into whose hands
would the G:>vernm nt fall We would be left
witnout one, he suppoted Upon which of the
ooposin  factions wou'd the powei fall' Which
wou'd say to the other, Be yours the profit, and
mine *he re\enge'
The gentleman fi om South Cirohna is disturbed
by fnghttu! images of treachery and murder
The idea of the President brings to his imagina
tian eveiytning fnghtful wh.cn he has lead of in
history He pictures the Presidentas a Richard,
murdering hi¡> helpieos and infant competitors
while they are psleep m the tower He says, too,
that the acts of the President would have caused
rebellion in the subjects of a King What waa
there of toi turmg jea ousy or mad ambition in the
bosom of the Piesident which would make the
allusion to Pochard applicable to him? What
more had the President to hope, wish, or expect,
from his country than he had already obtained >
What personal feeling or advantage was to accrue
to him from the removal of the deposites' By
that act Andrew Jackson had won for himself im-
mortal honor His open and manly features would
live in monumental marble long after the gentlemen
wno now assailed him should moulder in common
earth
The wit of th" gentleman from South Carolina
all runs along the Hudson, and hoveis about the
v cinity of Kindeihook It was useless to be so
much disturbed about the Dutchmen, for they
were too phlegmatic to be at all disturbed them-
selves But the gentleman's fancy has found a
new thing under the sun He has found a Dutch
nullifier—a being that was never before heard of
in the world Had the gentleman made the tickets
for the wheel scene in 1824, the Dutchman would,
not have got his prize Mr P went on to turn
the anecdote against its author, but his remarks
were indistinctly heard by the reporter.
Those who had been opposed to the bank on
constitutional grounds, had now got rid of their
const tutional objections The President, they
said, had done wrong, and this was a sufficient
reason for them to abandon their constitutional
objections to a bank But there was at least one
member f'om Georgia whose conscience could not
be quieted by this, panacea How could those
gentlemen drop so suddenly all then constitutional
principles, because one man in the nation had, in
tneir opinion, done wrong'
Mi P here adverted to the conduct of the bank
in withholding the pension fund. Was it a legis-
lative, judicial, or executive duty, he asked, to
collect money according to law, and to disburse it
according to law' But the bank says it will lock
in the iron jaws of its vaults the little pittance
granted by the Government for the war worn
veterans of the Revolution, and if either House
of Congress sustains the bank, the money must
remain forever in the vaults of the bank He
denounced this act of the bank as the greatest
outrage upon law and public opinion that was
ever heard of
But it was said that the Secretary of the Treas-
ury ought not to act upon his own reasons, but
upon those of his opponents, who think differently
from him This point Mr P remarked upon at
some length He eulogized the firmness and dis-
interestedness manifested in the course of Mr.
Taney on this subject, yet it was said that the
Secretary had nothing more to do with the act
than the iron pen wi'h which he signed theorder,
orthan the hangman has with an execution Why,
then, was Mr Taney abused for the act > What
was the Secretary to do' There were some
grounds necessary for themeasure Thedirectors
were appointed by the Piesident and Senate But
that guard had been broken down The Govern-
ment directois weie spurned as spies and inform-
ers The gentleman from South Carolina says
that the duty of tht Government directors was to
assist in increasing the profita of the bank, and
that ihere their duty was to stop They tell about
the deposites and the safety of the institution He
would rather that the whole public treasure weie
deposited in the ocean, than that the use made of
it by the bank should be tolerated Write me,
says the bank, one hundred thousand libels against
the Piesident, and we will pay you one hundred
thousand dollars Was the Secretary to asqui-
esce in such abuses '
He next referred to the singular restriction of
the administration of the bank affairs by its ex-
change commi'tee Mr Sergeant had only to
say, " Let 50,000 copies of such a work te
printed," and Mi Biddle, "Let all (as many as
sue required to forwaid our interest) be pub-
lished " And this is the very responsible way
by which the people's money goe«
In concluding Mr P referred to the threadbare
charge against the President, of his being a mili-
tary man "Ves, he is a military man, and thark
Heaven we have such a military man to stand at
