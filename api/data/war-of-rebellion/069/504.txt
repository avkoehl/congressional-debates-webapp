Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The enemy has moved a force, seemingly not more than a brigade, around my right, crossing the Totopotomoy. They are seemingly now lying in the woods in the rear of Washington Junes' house, feeling about with their skirmishers and scouts, apparently to ascertain the disposition of our force. I have a line of skirmishers north of the Totopotomoy, swinging around toward the Jones house. I can find nothing of the cavalry, but considerable distant firing has been heard to the right. My line of skirmishers is in the position of my main line last night. My command is in readiness to move at any time. The enemy are feeling my line of skirmishers a little now.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.
