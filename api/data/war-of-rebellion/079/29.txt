The general commanding directs that you reconnoiter roads, so as not to come in contact with other troops, and also to lay under bridge to use, if occasion requires. General Thomas's bridge is down.

General HOWARD:

Let Ransom come in slowly, and if the enemy approach sally out and attack him fiercely. General Davis will be in close support. I will throw General Stanley across the Chattahoochee and be prepared to put our whole force in motion to interpose between Hood who may attempt to mash our road about Marietta and his bridges at Campbellton. Be prepared to send in all your troops at Atlanta, and to follow General Stanley. I would attack this corps in position presume it is strongly intrenched.

W. T. SHERMAN,
