HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS, March 3, 1865. [Received 8.10 p.m]

General J. W. TURNER,Chief of Staff:

A messenger just in reports that three rebel boats came down-two stopping at our picket-line at the grave-yard, the other keeping on down. The musketry was occasioned by the rebel pickets opening on ours, and ours replying. My staff officer has not yet returned.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

KAUTZ'S HEADQUARTERS, March 3, 1865.

Brigadier-General TURNER:

The First Mounted Rifles, if Colonel Sumner could go with it, would answer the lieutenant-general's purpose better than any other that I have. If the expedition is not to go immediately he could be communicated with so as to go with it. The other officers that could be trusted for such work are brigade commanders. If there will be twenty-four or forty-eight hours' time his regiment would be the one I would designate. Colonel Sumner can be communicated with at the National Hotel, Norfolk.

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Major-General.
