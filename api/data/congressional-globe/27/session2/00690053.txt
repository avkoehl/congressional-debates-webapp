CONGRESSIONAL QhOBÉ.
whether the subject of the tariff, as referred to in
the President's message, «hould be committed to
the charge of the Committee on Manufactures or
to the Committee of Ways and Means, to which
committee the subject of the revenue, the receipts
and expenditures oí the Government, and the wa>s
and means to carry it on, properly belong Yet
he should not bave entered at all upon this subject
had it not been already introduced to the House
by other gentlemen during the course of the debate.
The gentleman from Virginia, formerly chairman
of the Committee of Way 5 and Means, [Mr. J.
W. J0ME3,] alluded to that potti n of the Presi-
dent's message m which he states that expenditures
for the present year at upwards of thirty-two
millions of dollars, ard remarked that here was
seen the vast difference which frequently exists
between profession and practice. In reply to
that remark, something was «aid about the neces-
sity of these expenditures, in consequence of the
twelve million debt which was bequeathed to this
administration by the last. It would be recollected
by all, that in the report of the late Secretary of the
Treasury, [Mr. Ewing,] a method the most
surprising was siez d upon to swell out the
amount of indebtedness, and that was by including
in his estimate, the expenses that were to be incur-
red, and aho including the balances that he pro-
posed to be kept on hand in the Treasury. Now
he could conceive of no other way of arn/ingat
the amount of that defet but b> counurg he out-
standing Treasury notes. Accirdmg to ¡us recol-
lection they were but a hule over five millions of
dollars when the last Admm.stration went out of
office. But had this debt been paid by the pie ent
Admmistratior,'? On the contrary, it appeared Dy
the return* made by the Secretary ot the Treasury
on the 1st of December, mat the amount of Trea-
sury notes then outstanding was seven millions and
upwards, and that an addition of two m 1 ions had
been made to thit portion Oi th" public debt ly this
reform Administration So far *roin having pa'd
off the small debt of five mulicn-, of ihe last Ad-
ministration, they hadmcresoed that deot to twelve
millions and a haif.
Something also had been said in the course of
this debate in re'atioa to the extendi lae of the
sum of thim-nme millions jear!} dnrng I'f Van
Buren's admmistrat'oi. Not , mere were docu-
ments which could be referred 10, and whica would
show the amount of expenditures proper of tr-SL

But to ccme mote nnmedia'ny to •' e s-bj ct be-
fore the House.
It seemed to him that if any thing was wanting
to prove the truth of the suggestion he made in in-
troducing his amendment referring this part of the
message to the Committee of Wajs and Means—
(which suggestion wa«, that it was a question be-
tween laying a tariff for protection and a tariff for
revenue)—that proof had been furnished by the
course which this debate bad taken. For, what
had they heard? The old arguments in favor of a
protective tariff. And al'hough some gentlemen
professed to wish only a tariff for revenue, still the
whole course and tenor of their argument went to
show that they were desirous to make the incident
greater than the principle.
The question (Mr. A. contended) in replying to
the arguments of some gentlemen, was not whether
the Committee on Manufactures ought to be abo-
lished, (although there had been an attempt to make
that the issue,) nor whether incidental protection
might or m>ght not, in any instance, be afforded.
But the sole question was, as he conceived, should
the object of a taiiff be to raise revenue, or to afford
protee'ion? That, he considered, was the only
question involved in the issue before the House.
And he mu*t be permitted to say, that those who
suggested that the doctrines of free trade were de-
signed for the exclusive benefit of the South, and
that those 'tho advocated then thereby protected
the South, or that tho'e doctrines were calculated
to subserve the inteiest of any part cular <eetion,
or class, or «pecics of industry, did injustice to
those expansive, enlarged, and liberal doctrines
Tnry made them«elves liable to tne very objection
which, m his opinion, those who favored the pro-
active tariff policy were liable. For his oun part,
he considered that these doctrines were well ca'cu-
lated to do justice to all port ens of the Onion; he
conceived them calculated, he would rot Fay to
pioteci—beeau.e that word had been «ornuch mis-
used—out to give free scope to industry,and to en-
courage every clas* of «ocicty. They were ciicu-
la'ed to prevent sp'Ciai Irgi-ialion f< r spec a! inte-
rest';, and for piriicular sections an Í this he re-
garded as their great merit.
Reference h?d been made to die State which he
m part represented—mad , too, in a somewhat un-
kind manner—by a gentleman from New York
pnd a gentietmn from Vermont. This re'erei-ce
he thcua it mcalled for. The Legiilatare of ine
Sta 0 of New Hampshire hid, on vauous- occa-
sion , p «sed resolutions exprrssive of the r opi-
n on bo'h as to the uncoustitut.onahiy and inexpe-
diency of a pro'ective tariff—re-olu'ions couche!

He teliP/ed ibit it wouli takealo^sume to CiQ
v c > the pcoí¿e of this connuv, that l°gi>'a on 11
ípvor oí any one t articular class, wa for 'ne be-
nefit of all the rest. What was it but a new ver-
sion of the old doctrine, let the Government take
care of the rich, and the rich will take care of the
poor? The gentleman from Massachusetts seemed
to think that those who were not willing to vote
for referring this subject to the Committee on Ma-
nufactures, were for turning all the mannfactnres
in the country; and this was always the way with,
those who claim special privileges. If you are
unwilling to grant them all th<-y ask by taxing the
rest of the community for their benefit, they make
a great outcry that you are oppressing them and
mining their business. Thus it was with the banks.
They must have the privilege of passing off fheif
worthless irredeemable paj,er, and by this means
deiraudmg and swindling the public, or else
they are grievously injured and oppressed.
But the argument of the gentleman from
New York was a little amusing He calls on us
to piotect American labor against the pauper labor
of Great Britain, and m another part of his re-
marks, he calls upon us to follow the example of
England, in leg slating for the protection of do-
mestic industry. Why, according to the gentle-
man, England has been taking the same means for
protecting her labor; and jet, to protect American
labor against the pauper iabor ef England, we are
called upon to introduce the same species of legis-
lation wtuca has red'iced the people of that country
to the coictinn of paupers. Did the gen'leman
want die free people of this country to be ground
down to the slate of wretchedness, destitution, and
vi e, that tho laboring Masses of Europe suffer un-
dei? Mr. A did not know what the gentleman
meant b/ protec icn of American laborers; but
he should 'hink, fiom hi  arguments, that it was the
same kind of protec ion that vulturesgave to lambs.
What was ih s boasted protection after all? Why,
it was nothing more nor less than taxation. And
did gentlemen think that the people c f this coun-
try could be broc¡£ht to believe that taxation was
a blessing' If our industr> depenaed on legisla-
tion such as tms, v. ny ret lav the taxes whether
the money was reeded or noil And, indeed, those
who went for this doctrine cf protection must bs
 .i l.ng no onty to increase ¡he expendi'ures of the
Gov-pjeP' fjr the s«k of la'jig taxes, bat to
