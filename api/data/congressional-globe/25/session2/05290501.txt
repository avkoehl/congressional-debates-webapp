How d d it happen ihat the harbor bi 1 had always been selected
as the special object at which these difficulties ind objections
were directed 7 Why had not this dtseietion been vested m the

of less public utility? He hadeverv proper confidi ice m the
Executne He had given sufficient proofs of this But he
would not sacrifice the great intereso his constituents to
