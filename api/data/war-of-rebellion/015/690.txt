FRONT ROYAL, June 9, 1862.

I am directed to inform you that it is the order of the President of the United States that Major-General Fremont shall hold the valley in connection with Major-General Banks, and that the forces belonging to the Department of the Rappahannock be immediately marched on Richmond to co-operate with Major-General McClellan.

It has been, and is still, no doubt much desired that Jackson shall be made to pay for his late dash down the valley, and if there is a reasonable expectation of his being caught no doubt the order for the advance on Richmond would be suspended. But it is not clear from your report what is the position of your command at this time, and it is inferred that the force at Port Republic is small, as well as the party expected to be at Waynesborough. If this is so, the general thinks you have forgotten your instructions not to move your force so that the several parts should not be in supporting distance of each other. If, however, you are in hot pursuit and about to fall on the enemy, and can do so with reasonable chance of success without relying on the troops at Front Royal, who are too far in rear to support you in your extended movements, the general is not disposed to recall you; but if you have only detachments thrown out in front your command should not be placed in such positions as to prevent compliance with the President's general plan of operations, and you should at once call in the advance parties and move upon Fredericksburg, there to be refitted for the march to Richmond.

The general desires an immediate reply.
