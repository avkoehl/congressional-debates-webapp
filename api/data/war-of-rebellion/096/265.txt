By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,January 25, 1865-10 a. m.

General STEVENSON:

What news have you? How is the brigade on the Shenandoah? Please answer at once.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., January 25, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

The rise in Shenandoah was from an ice gorge above, and went down as rapidly as it came up. It jammed the bridge badly, pushing it down stream about twenty yards on Loudoun end, and one boat stove in. We will have it all right as soon as the ice runs out. Potomac railroad bridge is all right; troops passing continually. Nothing further in way of news.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,January 25, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding, Harper's Ferry:

I want you to destroy al ferry-boats on the Shenandoah from Berry's Ferry down to Harper's Ferry. This must be done secretly, or the boats will be concealed or taken to the east side. Call on Reno to do this work.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,January 25, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

One of my scouts from Shepherdstown reports that forty rebels entered that place a few nights ago and robbed two stores. Have you any facts in the case, and is it best to allow stores to be opened there?

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
