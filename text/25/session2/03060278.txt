any other in the Umon,(though he was aware that a
contrary opinion prevailed among many in relation
to Missouri,) where a small man, for a supposed of-
fence, was cruelly lashed by a large one, the result of
which was a challenge on the part of fie small one
to fight, in which duel the large man w as, shot
twice, the last wound mortal The survivor was
found guilty under the laws of Missouri, when a
etition was gotten up, signed almost unanimously
y the people, and presented to the Legislature,
which body remitted the penalties almost by accla-
mation, and so Mr L said it would be in all like
cases, either the Legislature or Executive would
step In to counteract the law If sucha bill could
be introduced as would strike at the root of the
evil, it would cheerfully have his support He was
aware that duelling was not defensible on principle?
of Christianity, neither was national warlare, and
yet how frequently had it been engaged in, and
justly too, by Chiistian nations All the Legisla-
tures of the Union have concurred m denouncing
the practice of duelling as evil m itself, and jet
have we not seen them come m to stay the lavs
From what little he had seen, it appeared to him
that fighting was like marrying, the moie bainers
^that w re erected against it, the surer were they to
come together
Mr SMITH spoke long and vehemently in
favor of the bill, maintaining that all enacl
ments against crime had grown out of some p i t
act of villany that shocked the moral sense oí the
communitj The object of lhis law was not so
much to prevent those fond of duelling from en-
gaging in it, as to protect those coming from Slates
where the people were not fond of murder or kill-
ing in any shape For his own part he wa  not
afraid of any man with pistol or sword, but he ad-
vocated the bill to protect the representatives of
New England from those gentlemanly assassins m
banditti, who might seek to call them out for words
spoken in debate, and shoot them m a fair and
gentlemanly manner. Mr S alluded, in no measur-
ed terms, to the late ttansaction, m which a
representative had lost his life, and said, if the in-
stigator of that murdei had been in Connecticut,
he would no more have escaped than if he had
gone up and shot down his victim m the stieet
Mr S was for arresting this practice m its mcipi-
ency, by striking at once at the root of the evil, and
making all persons, however remotely comeincd,
punishable He thought the man tint advised 10
such a step was as bad as the ptmeipa.1, and would
treat him accordingly M1, S could not diaw am
distinction between a murder in a due!, aidontoi
it, and he maintained there was none, save that
which grew out of the morbid imagination of gen-
tlemen on such matters Was not the effect the
same to the bereaved wife—the children, made or-
phans? and was not the moral sense of the
commumumty alike shocked? These were ques-
tions for the advocates of dueling to an-
swer He thought the country bound to erect
some barrier against th s infamous system, or,
by-and-by, the people, who send their represa -
tatives to Congress, would nave to accompanj
them with a body guard, armed uilh swoids and
pistols for their protection If a man would, in
contravention of the laws of God and man, ^eek 10
Jight duels, he (Mr. S ) was clear for inflicting
upon him that punishment which sn¡ old be meted
to the criminal of the worst dye
Mr CLAYTON spoke some tunc in  fa\oi   of
an amendment which he offered, to wit   mio,c tm„
persons engaged ma  duel to lmpusonmenl tor a
term not exceeding two 5 ears, and a fine  n t ex-
ceeding two thousand dolían   and lo be ma ie Joi
ever after ineligible to any office with   the sift ut
the Government     Mr C dwelt on the emeu.) 0
such laws in his own State, where duelling  was
once quite common, but had now entnri\ ceased
Even the shooting of pistols, which had been prac-
tised as an amusement, had, since the pissw n<*
the law, gone entirely out of fashion
Mr. LINN repudiated the idea of denouncing
men as murderers and felons, because they had
fought duels. Some of the purest and best men on
efürth had been engaged in them, and should not be
so stigmatized That some duels bad taken place
from light and insufficient causes, was not to be
denied, and certainly was much to be regretted.
The question was, how is the practice to be pre-
vented' Mr L would answer, not from cruel and
sanguinary laws, which 111 all cases remained a
dead-letter on the statute books Where was there
an instance of the r being carried into effect? In
no case could a jury of twelve men be found to
give a decision that would doom a man to the gal-
lows, or the loathsome cells of a penitentiary, and
brand his name with the infamous epithets of mur-
deier or assassin, because he had killed another
fairly 111 a duel Mr L thought there weie cases
of deadly insult which few men would not be
read), at all nsls, to resent, and, if he could be
allowed to judse lioin the unusual warmth and the
temper displaced by the Senator from Connecticut
fMi Smith] in this matter, that he would be as
willing and ready as any man to come forward on
all piopti occasions
Mi GRUNDY lelt disposed to act 111 this mat-
te 1 without reference to any occurrences of recent
d Ue, lie had found it best 111 all subjects of legis-
tion, not to allude to topics calculated to e\cite In

visions, that it would have a powerful effect on
public opinion, and certainly 110 man that voted for
it, could ever fight a duel afteiwatds All the Se-
nate could do, was to provide such enactments as
weie deemed best calculated to puta steip to the
