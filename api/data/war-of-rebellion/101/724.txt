4. Colonel E. C. Catherwood, Thirteenth Missouri Veteran Volunteer Cavalry, is hereby relieved from the command of the post of Rolla, Mo., and will rejoin his regiment forthwith. On assuming command of his regiment Colonel Catherwood will at once take such measures as may be necessary for the proper protection and care of the horses of his command.

By order of Brigadier-General Brown:

J. H. STEGER,Assistant Adjutant-General.

ROLLA, MO., February 2, 1865.

Colonel E. C. CATHERWOOD,

Commanding Post of Rolla, Rolla, Mo.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that in obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 21, current series, from headquarters Post of Rolla, Mo., I proceeded to Little Piney River and Beaver Creek, scouting over that section of country, and found the body of the man Sallee, but no trace of those who murdered him. I am informed, however, that one John Brown, a noted guerrilla, was one of the murderers. I arrested his wife for harboring him. I arrested Mrs. Fore for harboring guerrillas and bushwhackers. I also arrested John Lester, Widows Wright and Coleman for the same reasons. I have the honor to report further that this section of country between the roads to Springfield and Houston is infested to a great extent with bushwhackers and guerrillas, and is, in my opinion, a general rendezvous for them during certain months in the year. My men were only partially supplied with rations for the time specified, and were compelled to live on what the country afforded.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. KELLEY,

Second Lieutenant Company G, Thirteenth Missouri Cavalry.
