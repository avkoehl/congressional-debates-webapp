the payment of public due;, The notes of banks
issuing small notes will either be taken by them, 01
they will not, if they do take them, they become as
current as their own, and have within them as
many principles ofcuireney If they do not re-
ceive them, they will still be current, and the more
so, as thp banks m league with the Government
will be removed from compet tion in the small
note circulation The argument of the Senator
from South Carolina who sits near me, was misun-
derstood by me, or it has been m sundcrstood by
others, with regard to the currency of bank notes
He has been supposed to have said, that bank notes
owe their whole currency to their being receivable in
debts to this Government I did not so understand
him, and I do not admit the truth of the position
They unquestionably owe tne larger portion of their
credit to this cause, but then they derive a good
poition of their credit from their being receivable
in debts to ¡he State Governments—to the confi-
dence which many will always have in the in-
stitutions which issue them—to the established
custom of the country which has rendered diem
currenl—and to the eagerness with which ever}
thing at all akin to mcney is laid hold of when
offered, lest nothing better may be pr sented,
and the chance of getting even that pas away
These considerations will continue long to sustain
the circuí tuon of small notes, and many banks
will find it too profitable to issue them to be tempt
ed by anv prospect of gam which you hold out to
them in the plan of the Senator from Virginia to
abandon it Add to this that while you continue
your connectirn wi h banks, >ou will never ac
comphsh one of the great purposes of 1 gislation—
public repose, and qui t What we now do, ousht,
if possible, to be well done, and it is far moreim
portant than that it shou'd be done hastdv In
your partneiship with (be banks they will aHv ys
find subjects of complaint agai"st vor, mal e tne
concession the gin.md of nghi to demand anolhei
and whenever refused raise a clamor w hich will
excite the elements sf polincal strife from one end
of the continent to the other
I have said that it does not belong to this Go-
vernment to regulate ciedit and piper currency,
and I insist further that if this were an absolute,
unlimited Government, it would be expedient for
it to interfere as little with such matters as possible
In the first place it is a subject to which nature
herself has furnished laws, a few of which are
simple and well understood, but man, of them
are very occult, and scaicely perceptible, and the
most sagacious mind is incapable oí íoreseemg the
result even of a few of their combinations, and
must therefore act with great rashness in med-
dling unnecessarily with matters in which great
evils may tie produced m the end, without
any well-founded confidence of advantages in an-
ticipation The most enhghtfi cd writers on poli-
tical economy, in modern times dene unce Ihe igno-
rant quackery which foimerly shackled Irac'e v\ ith
multifarious laws and regulations, -ml have disco-
vered that freedom is her element Every attempt to
control hei, diminishes her freedom, and those who
are now beseeching Congress to take her under its
special charge, would, if th°u prayer weie granted,
ere long discover, lhat when trade lavs herseK at
the footstool of powei for protection, she has de-
serted her native element has voluntarily torn
away the plumage which sustains ber in Lei pros-
perous flight, and having become faint and lan-
guishing, will sigh vainly for the leturn of her
health and buoyancy. We are told too of the value
of credit and its connection w ith freedom, and if
I may be allowed to refe, to a lettei made pub ic
some weeks ago commg ftom a high quartet, I
will take the liberty of saying lhataclmk of vvoids,
and apparent beauty of sentiment which it con-
tains, is calculated to bear away tne public rrmd
to wrong conclusions It is there said "that credit
distinguishes the free Government from the des-
potic," and the connection in which the expression
is used, would lead one to suppose that Ihe truth of
the sentiment implied that to keep a nation
free, you must maintain credit, whereas the
real beauty of the remark is found m the
trith being precisely the other way You can
not make  a nation nee,  by giving her credit,
but you can give her credit, by making her
free Let us not mistake the relationship
of freedom and credit, it is not collateral, but lineal,
and it is likewise important that we should not mis-
take the child for the parent Credit is the offspring
ol freede m, and not freedom the offspring of credit
God forbid lhat I should be an enemy to credit, but
I am desiious to see a natural, spontaneous credit,
resting upon a sound basis, not a spurious, facti
tiou« credit, swelling like a balloon, with nothing
but wind—as luoyant ard as frail You cannot
legislate credit into healthy existence, but in the
attempt to do so v ou may give it temporary ple-
thora, destined to end in apoplexy and death Cre-
dit is most delicate in its nature, and few hands are
gentle enough to touch it The slightest causes ele-
vate or depress it Its extreme sensibility is
strikingly illustrated by a passage in Roman his-
toiy, which now occurs to my mind It was during
what is called the piratical war, or the war against
the pirates Provisions at Rome and in the sur-
rounding country had become extiemely scarce,
and could only be had at enoimous puces The
supphes for the army and navy were nearly ex-
hausted, and there was but a cheerless prospect of
having them renewed At this crisis, the Senate
res dved to appoint Pompev the Great genera'is-
simo of the expedition against the pirates, merely
in reference to his military talents and suc-
cesses, but strange to tell, prices immediately
came down, and provisions were abundant
Here, then, was a cause instantly and power
fullv affecting- prices and credit, which no one
could have foieseen, and yet the uniers of the (hy
assure us it is so And is it possible, while this
Governm nt-emams so mtimatciv cennected with
the paper currency and credits of th  country, that
it can fail greatlv to affect them b) eveiy move-
ment? Lile a gi°at giant, it his on'v to mov<
one of its mign e^« or arm?, an 1 a'l he e errents
around it are imm^diate'v thrown mtocoav ulsions
This dangerous juxta-position, therefoie, ought to
cease—so embarra smg to the Government and
threatening to the paper currency and ciedit No
maifer how urgent the necessity may he in othei
respects, Government must mot e with causón, or
not move at all lest she may derange the cui-
rency, or, lfloo1 ng solely, oi even mainly, to the
constitutional ends ol ifs creation, it does act, the
air is immediatelv lent with cries of distress, and
the Government is told it has done the mischief
and must repair it that it must bind up the wounds
of a bleeding ccurtrv, nav, and poui into the-m o 1
and nine, too, frcm the Treasuiy Su< h was the
outcry on the removal of the deposi'es, such upon
the refusal to reeharter the United States Bank,
such upon the «sue of the Treasury circular, all
of them measures strictly political, and adopted
wi*h re'erence to the action of the Government is
such, but compl cated as it had become with tie
paper enrrenev and «edits el the coum y, nothing
s'ioul 1 have I pen done eveiy thug shou'd ha c
been leit undone, it is sai 1, which, m Ihe end hap-
pened to aflect them What lenedv is theie for
this evil but the d ^connection ) loposed?
But althc ugh the Government, vvhethei united 11
not to the banks mbei fiscal operations,ean dob it lit
tie legitimately towardsiegulatingth-ar oapei cuiren-
c\, she can, by that union, do much to inflame the
evils, and bv m doing, work much injustice She
can by that union greatly increase the credi' of
those institutions, and give a widei o ículation to
their pa) er issues, and m this way increas-e what
are called mercan*i'e facilities The Sena-
tor from South Carolina has lllustia ed this
matter by a figure so string and r re ble, that
it con d not fail, I think, to hate Drought convic-
tion to all who heard him Yes, s r, take ihe btg-
eai from the street, and stipulate v. ith him that no-
thing but go'el and silvei and h s notes will be ic-
ceived in payment of debts to hs Government |
and Crcesus himself was nevei nchei than he
would instantly become
But what right have the merchants or the b inks
to make a profit upon tne Gov eminent tunds, to the
exclusion, oi nearly to the exclusion, oí all other
classes' It is vain to set up the plea that tht bene-
fit of one class is the benefit of all, for the same
plea is equally applicable to anv acl of inequality
and injustice, however monstrous. Eveiy one
knows that bank stockholders are mainly confined
to a very few classes, and it is those who make the
profits upon the public funds while in the custody
0  banks Tell mc not that by expansion of the
currency, the faimei and the laborer obtain better
prices foi their pre duce and their labor Nominal-
ly it is so, but they must, in at least an equal pro-
portion, pay foi what thev consume, and of those
who are fortunate enough to lay aside any thing
above then actual expenses, the ordinary subjects
of then investments increase in nominal value with
the expansion of the cunency, and they hold them
liable to all the fluctuations of that uncertain ele-
ment, rendered so entirely tor the profit of others.
But leav mg, as time compels me to do, the ine-
quality of its operations upon individuals, how
much moie unequal is it is its local opera-
tions' Where aie the banks? In mercantile com-
munities Where are our mercantile communi-
ties'! With a very few exceptions, in our northeast-
ern country There, not only the bank stockholders
and merchants, but all who are near them and
around them, pai take of thebenefit in some degree, as
the plat of ground which lies near a stieara, al-
though the prolific showei mav not fall immediately
u pon it, is v et refreshed and fertilized by the moisture
diffuseei through the atmospheie Why is it that
p'enty and prospeuty rest on the bleak and barren
hills of the north, w hile the sunny and alluvial val-
leys of the South are dany becoming more and more
impoverished? What is it but the lesult of the
partial and unconstitutional system undei which
w e have been living? In v am does the Constitution
declare that taxation shall be equal, if, when col-
lected, some favoied reg ons are to be fosteied and
ennched by it while otheis aie left to struggle
on, worse than neglected with no other benn son
but ll a  of natnie
As a snrt rr' al m-p to ih s irgt ment the Sena-
tor from Indina, whe has just addressed you,
insists that the effect of collecting the Government
dues in gold an silver will be to d^am all the
spocie from the West, as little or none of the pub-
lic expenditures w ill be in that quartet Now, I
am at issue with that Senator, both as to the fact
aud the inference he draws from it I do not
agree that the pul'ic expenditures have not been
in greater propoitions on the Mi sissippt than on
the seaooard If I am conectlj informed, more
monev has been paid to the Imlians for extinguish-
ing ih r title to the hne's m that Senators own

that io longer ago than last winter, I my self rose in

pi lations in lhat direction Doubtless ample ex-
pendituies will be made in ihe West But whether
