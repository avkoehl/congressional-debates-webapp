by three French frigates, and you have on that
stuion, I believe, one frigate and (too sloops of
vvu' Yes, sir, I have all along thought that it
wis high time we were making preparation I
thought so for two reasons, I knew that we were
not upon a íespectable peace establishment, and
I thought what I think now, that war is not an
improbable thing, when General Jackson desires
it 1 therefore \ oted foi the $3,000,000, and more
than ever am I for making preparation, when I
feir that the question of peace or war depends
upon one man alone—he has enough to no his
bidding here and elsewhere—and when I look at
our strength compared with that of other nations
The naval forces of the United States, France,
and Great Britain, are-

Twenty million five hundred and fifty-two thou-
sand dolíais additional appropriation is required
to give us our relative naval strength, compared
with Fi-ince and Great Britain Five million five
hundred thousand dollars per annum required for
ten ye^rs, to attain and keep afloat such a force
I think, when we look upon this comparative
statement, we cannot say to France, as did the
wolf to the lamb in thef-vble, " Tis crime enough
that she cannot resist'"
4nd I think this will show us, sir, that, if war
*ai expected or intended, there was a strong ne-
cessity to commence preparations for war Our
own quarrel, our own weak state of preparation,
and our enemy's strength, should long ago, say I,
have admonished the watchful guardians of the
nation to be making ready They have been
furiously charging upon others, upon the Senate
of the last Congress, foi not putting the country
in a state of defense And now, sir, if it can bp
show n that they are themselves the guiltiest of
the guiltv in this high offense, what shall be done
with the culprits' Shall thtv not have the poi-
soned chalice returned to their own lips, which
thev have offered to others' Be it remembered,
sir, that the Executive conducts our foreign rela-
tions—he has known the chances and dangers of
war much bettei than we Ay, sir, some devel-
opments we know were withheld from us If the
country should have been preparing for war, then
should not the President have been making some
recommendation of the kind' Should he not have
been warning us to prepare' Where are the rec-
ommendations of the Executive, the estimate, the
messages, the communications of the Depart-
ments, up to this very week of this session '
None, no, not one ' Was the President for war
during the last session' When did he call, or in-
timate a call, for the defense of the country' Sir,
will it be believed that the Secretary of the Navy
has not this session, until this present week,fur-
nished your Committee on Naval Affairs with
the estimates, the ordinary estimates of appro-
priation '
And here, sir, I must be permitted to vindicate
the notable minority of eighteen' I intend to do
that now—to mark facts hereafter as we go along,
and note events as they occur; for I am now more
than sufficiently admonished never to leave the
defense of my acts in one Congress to any sub-
sequent Congress which may follow Yes, sir,
no estimates were furnished the committee to
which I belong by the Navy Department this
winter, until they were kicked out of it. If it
was so great a sin not to vote three millions addi-
tional for the increase of the Navy last winter, is
it no sin not to ask for one cent up to this time
this winter' Sir, it will be recollected that, on
the 11th of January, the honorable chairman of
the Committee on Naval Affairs [Mr Jarvis] in-
troduced a resolution "that the Committee on
Naval Affairs be instructed to inquire into the
expediency of increasing the naval force in com-
mission " Iopposedthatresolution.votedagamst
it, and was thrown by my good friends in this
House, into a notable minority of eighteen. To
vindicate that eighteen, and to exemplify fully
the exact maneuver of the three million antena .
ment last session, sir, I must detail to you a short
history of the facts of the case Sometime pre-
vious to the tim° when the resolution was offered
by the honorable chairman, [Mr. Jarvis,] he and
I were walking on that highway of the nation,
Pennsylvania Avenue We met, sir, a distin-
guished member of the board of Navy commis-
sioners—a commodore, who shared in the naval
fights and victories of the last war. We stopped
to hold a conversation, in which that officer of the
Navy Department frankly admitted that our Navy
required a large appropriation, much larger appro-
priation than had been called for by (he Secretary,
and said that "if we got into a war with France,
we would be whipped for the first three years "
" Well, sir," I replied, " if we are to be drubbed
for that length of time, I think we had better take
care not to get into the fight, or had better begin
to prepare for it as soon as possible." He said,
"After we were v/hipped for about that length of
time, we would begin to get ready," and begged
the honorable chairman and myself to have an
eye to the necessities and wants of the Navy
Sir, I am willing to take all responsibility which
belongs to me, and sometimes more than belongs
to me in case of emergency But I had begun to
suspect what I suspect still, that this French war
is but a mere key to unlock the Treasury, and
that Congress is to be made, through the cry of
national defense, to take the responsibility of
turning it, and opening the door for patronage
If the money should happen to be required, and
the appropriation be popular, the praises all would
be shouted to the Executive, who had not recom-
mended it; and if unnecessai y and unpopular, the
curses and the blame would be sure to fall on
Congress I therefoie was determined, so far as
I could, to block the game—to make those who
should take the responsibility I was willing, and
am still, to vote for any íeasonable appropriation
if called foi, but I wos determined to know what
additional appropriation would be "in accord-
ance with the views of the Executive" before the
election of the next Congress Accordingly, it
was proposed in the Committee on Naval Affairs
to inquire of the Secretary of the Navy whether
any additional appropriation for the increase of
the Navy was required The inquiry was directed
to be made by our honorable chairman, [Mr Jar-
vis,] some time before he offered his resolution
of the 11th instant, and was then pending. No
answer had been returned to the Committee on
Naval Affairs, though it seems now an answer I
had been given to the honorable chairman. Now,
sir, when the honorable chairman offered that
resolution, will I' be believed that he knew, by the
answer fi om the Secretary, that he (the Secretary)
had declined to answer the inquiry of the commit-
tee' When the honorable chairman offered that
resolution, he did not state that his committee
had already inquired and could get no answer I
did not know then, though á member of the com-
mittee, that our inquiry had been refused an an-
swer, and thought it was still pending. If still
pending, I thought the resolution supererogatory
To ascertain whether our inquiry had been an-
swered, it will be recollected that I attempted to
ask a question of the honorable chairman before
I opposed his resolution. That question was,
whether the inquiry ort the very same subject of
the resolution which we had already anticipated,
had been answered by the Department' and I hope
it is still remembered by the House how I was
prevented from obtaining the answer which I de-
sired from the honorable chairman. I asked the
question; the chairman was rising to answer When
the Speaker asked, " Does the gentleman from
Virginia yield the floor'" "Yes, to have his
question answered by the gentleman from Maine,''
[Mr. Jarvis ] The question was repeated, and
again and again interrupted by the Speaker m
the same way, until I gave up in despair the at-
tempt to obtain the answer which was so neces-
sary for the correct information of the House. It
was the first time since I have been a member
that ever I sair a gentleman thus interrupted, and
positively prevented from obtaining an answer to
an inquiry for information courteously put to a
member in his seat.                               .
But, sir, I can confirm a remark which was
made the other day, that the Speaker may if he
will, bj many (neks upon order and courtesy 
too, exercise undue powers over the proceedings
of this body. So it was an honest inquiry was,
it seemed to me designedly, stifled in the case
which I put The answer was not obtained,
which, if it had been obtained, I flatter myself
there would have been apparently either no ne
cessity for the resolution of the honorable chair-
man, or there would have been no minority of
eighteen. The resolution passed with a vote in the
affirmative of one hundred and sixty-four. And
what then did the Committee on Naval Affairs
do' How "inquire into the expediency of in-
creasing the naval force in commission," without
going right back to the Department, which had
already once refused to answer the very same
inquiry'
We did order a written inquiry to be imme-
diately directed to the Secretary, which is now
answered by a written communication, but which
also, I am told, would not have been answered,
but for a circumstance and an influence which I
am not authorized to name Yes, sir, the answer
has at last come, and what does it disclose'
Why, that the Department does want more than
six million for the Navy alone' The Department
of War also has, within this week, crept out of
its shell, and called for more than five million '
Eleven million now, instead of three, actually
wanted, and if wanted now, was wanting on the
3d of March, 1835, and no call, no recommenda-
tion, no estimates until almost this very moment'
Now, sir, does this need comment' Has there
not been clearly an attempt to shuffle off the re-
sponsibility on Congress' Is it not a plain case
that " the party" and its Departments have been
longing wishfully for a full sweep at the public
coffers, but they wanted you and I to take out
the money for them' If we refuse, the cry is
raised, " You are against defending the country;
the next step for you is to join the enemy '"
Sir, I will not put my hand into the Treasury
of the people until I know specifically for what
their money is to be expended Why, sir, even
after the House had adopted the resolution to in-
quire, and before an answer, by some new mode
of appropriating, the Committee of Ways and
Means, to insure relief to the Secretary, I sup-
pose, reported an increase of two millions to the
ordinary Navy bill, voluntarily, and without any
call or information from the Department, for aught
we know' Sir, this mode of voluntarily appro-
pi íatingenormous sums without mes sage, without
estimates, without recommendation, or informa-
tion, or responsibility, on the part of the Execu-
tive, other than in expending them, will soon
corrupt the Government, and make Congress but
the mere tool of the Executive' And now, sir,
what judgment shall be passed upon this same
Secretary of the Navy, who admits now, by his
own showing, that more than six millions addi-
tional are, and have been all the time, required
forthe "increase of the Navy,"and who yet has
never made any recommendation whatever, either
to this or the last Congi ess, except for twofngft tes,
three sloops-of-wai, and four steam vessel , vvhich
was meant as an increase to the peace establish-
ment only, up to this week of this session' Will
the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Hawes] now
embrace him in his mortification and regret, and
hand him over to the executioner for not defend-
ing the country'
Sir, my distinguished friend from South Car-
olina [Mr Thompson] told the gentleman from
New York, [Mr. Cammelenq,] the other day,
that " it is the fashion of * the party' not to
shrink from responsibility " My honorable fi lend
has convinced me that hewa mostexceHentjudge
of men and things, but he was mistaken that
time No, sir' General Jackson, in perfect ac-
cordance with his high-toned independence of
mind and action, asaumeflresponsibility, but "the
party" shrinks and skulks and dodges, in fear
and trembling.   When Jupiter shakes the em-
Jyrean heights, all the gods tremble I When
ackson frowns and stamps hrt foot, rises in his
majesty and says—" I take the responsibility '"
all the sycophants of " the party" quake with
fear ' Witness the deposit question. When the
President went forth in doubtful contest against
the bank, there was a "little man" who trembled
from his hair to his heels—[here some one said
he had no hair]—right, sir, his head is bald—from
