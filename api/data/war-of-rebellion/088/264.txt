HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-4 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The above [following], just received, was sent before the attack of which I have reported musketry and cannonading. No sounds now. As there appears to be a division of the enemy's cavalry on the railroad, I have ordered Kautz to draw in another of his regiments, leaving only one between the Blackwater Swamp and the James:
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-12.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My infantry has not yet succeeded in driving away the enemy from his point on the railroad but has forced him to draw back the artillery, from its first position. We have not engaged, but soon will be if the enemy's force does not retire. I think General Ayres in moving as well as he can. The enemy's cavalry are south of us on the railroad, and the main camps of the division were said by the prisoners to be about two or three miles west of the railroad. The position here is a large open, level field, about three-fourths of a mile through, and surrounded by woods.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

P. S.- I have just received the note brought by Captain Fisher about the cavalry. If any pickets were going to take their place, I would rather have them there than with me.

Just received and forwarded.*

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-5 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Just received and forwarded.+ This appears to have been an open fight, the enemy attacking, and Warren further reports them moving down on his left flank. He has two divisions beside those reported by him as engaged. I fancy he will not be able to do more than effect a lodgment on the road and that the enemy will vigorously dispute this.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

P. S. -There has been no firing since the fight here reported.
