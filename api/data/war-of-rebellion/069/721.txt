Parrott percussion, but the supply forwarded consists of the Schenkl of Hotchkiss, neither fit for my guns. If I am to use my guns upon the rebel fleet, I must have the proper percussion shells to be able to produce satisfactory results.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel 1st Conn. Artillery, and Chief of Artillery for Defenses.

JUNE 9, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

The enemy reply slowly. I have slackened our own fire and propose to make it still slower. I do not think it best to cease entirely yet. The enemy's fire is from their three or four guns in our front and one or two at Howlett's.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

Detained by break in wire.

PORTSMOUTH, June 9, 1864.

Captain JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Lieutenant-Colonel Evans and Major Preston have returned from their expedition without any casualty. They captured over 100 horses. A written report is expected to-morrow.

I. VOGDES,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, June 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General SHEPLEY,

Commanding:

Telegraph line between Gloucester Point and West Point has been down since 7 o'clock last evening. General Carr's assistant adjutant-general says he has no cavalry to escort our repairers, and considers it useless, to send infantry as they cannot go fast enough. There seems to be no prospect of repairing this line under these circumstances. Some arrangement is necessary at once, as all dispatches from the Army of the Potomac to Washington go over that line.

GEO. D. SHELDON,

Manager.

FLAG-SHIP AGAWAM,

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

A flag-of-truce tug came this afternoon to deliver a letter from Mr. Ould to Major Mulford. The army lookout on the hill near us has several times reported seeing the smoke stacks of the rebel steamers above Chaffin's Bluff.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
