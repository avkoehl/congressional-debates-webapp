COMMANDING OFFICER SIXTH CORPS:

Lieutenant-General Grant applies for the transfer of General Mackenzie to another command. What do you say? I have sent for Mackenzie to talk with him.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,March 13, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

I should much regret losing General Mackenzie, as I can't replace him by so good an officer. I hope, therefore, it will not be necessary to detach him from this corps, which has already lost many of its best officers by transfer to other commands.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
