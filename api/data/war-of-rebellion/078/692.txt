OFFICE COMMANDANT OF POST, Blue Mountain, July 7, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHANDLER,

Commanding Eighth Alabama Cavalry, near Blue Mountain, Ala.:

SIR: My orders from General Pillow were to establish a courier- line and keep General S. D. Lee posted as to movements of the enemy. General S. D. Lee, by special telegram, ordered me to do the same. I see all dispatches by courier go to you or Colonel Livingston. It cuts off my power of doing as Generals Lee and Pillow ordered, and besides, there may be information in the dispatches that General S. D. Lee prefers you not knowing.

Yours, respectfully,

GEO. GOLDTHWAITE,

Captain, Commanding Post.

P. S. -This courier-line is intended for General Lee. Send me all the dispatches received, or copies of them, so I can send them to General S. D. Lee.

Yours,

GEO. GOLDTHWAITE,

Captain, &amp;c.
