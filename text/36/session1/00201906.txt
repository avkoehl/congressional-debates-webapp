THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 2,
mnyhave made mistakes. From our stand-point,
it would aeem to me that It would have been
better to have provided in the Constitution for
the gradual abolition of slavery in all the States;
and f think, had tlio framers of the Constitution
foreseen what we now pee, they would have done
.so. The words of Pitt, on the East India hit!,
quoted approvingly by the gentleman from Al-
abama,were wise: "Good principles mis;ht sleep;
but bad ones never. It is the curse of society,
that when a bad principle is once established, bad
men will always be found to give it its full effect."
The spread and increase of slavery in this coun-
try, against the wish aud against ihc expectation
of the early fathers of the Republic, verify the
truth of the remark.
Now, Mr. Chairman, to the question, were our
fathers wrong, has the sentiment of Christendom
been wrong, and is the Republican party wrong',
in regarding slavery as an evil to be deplored and
a crime to be prohibited? I cannot take tunc to
define slavery, except that it reduces persons to
chattels to all intents, purposes, and constructions
whatever; ignores their rights to family, wife, or
children, except for the interest of others, and does
not rtcognizc the marriage iclation among slaves.
There are no laws in slave States regulating or
legalizing such relation among slaves. I under-
stood the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Simm*]
to say, in the debate on the polygamy bill, he did
not admit the legality of any such relation among
colored people. Tins is, necessarily, the law of
chattel slavery; for the legalization of that rela-
tion mterteres with the property character of
slaves, obstructs their unlimited transfer and sale,
and concedes to the slave rights inconsistent w.th
the rights uf the master. Now, to undertake to
prove that such an entne disregard, upon any pre-
text, of the rights of any class in society is w^ht,
is like arguing that two and two are four, orunder-
takmg to demonstrate a self-evident proposition.
1 understood the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr.
Lamar] to admit, in hts learned argument jr de-
fense of slavery, tiint the enslavement of the
Anglo-Saxon race would bo wrong, for they were
entitled to ireedom because they were capable of
governing themselves; but, at the same time, he
asserted that the enslavement of the African iace
wa^ right, because they weie incapable of gov-
erning themselves: in other woids, being an infe-
rior race, the superior race were justiJad m making
slaves of them. It is not within the ranw of what
I propose to say to leply to this diabolism. My
friend, Mr. Lovkjoy, made some remat ks upon
that which are worthy of consideration. {Jut \
would like to ask the'learned ,«,eiilleman a ques-
tion upon Ins governmental philosophy, jt is an
admitted fact that their is in the slave ttt.ues " a
visible admixtiuo"of Anf>Io-fc?ax. n with Altcan
blood, and (pule likely then, is as much Anglo-
Saxon as Afiican blood ensla\ed there. What
must be the proportion of admixture to make sla-
very rij ht ?
The advocates of sla very discard tlvoiies, spec-
ulations, and abstractions; they prefer aetual re-
sults. i am iilad of an opportunity to tost slavery
by the standard winch its advocates set up. Let
slavery and freedom be judged by their fruits. 1
will institute a comparison between freedom and
slavery from statistics—i'tom official document*
—about which there is no dispute. The statistics
which £ shall present are liom the Compendium of
the Census of l£JoU, by J. D. 13. De Bow, and flora
the Posfma,--iter General's report accompanying the
President's annual message, made at the com-
mencement of ihis Congress. These statistics will
show the "actual results" of ireedom and slavery,
respectively, upon the prosperity of the States;
then" material growth; their educational and moral
condition. I challenge gentlemen to show a sin-
gle fact incorrectly taken from the documents al-
luded to. I will first take the States of New
York and Viiginia. The former adopted the
" theories and abstractions" of the " able and dis-
tinguished men and patriots" of Virginia, aud
treated slavery, as they regarded it, " moie to be
deplored than to be fostered,'' and consequently
£otrid of it: while the latter repudiated these teach-
ings, and regarded African bondage " a blessing to j
both iacet ; one to be encouraged, cherished,and
foste)udand, consequently, has continued it to
the present time, and now defends it as a wise and
beneficent institution; and one of her Representa-
tives, [Mr. PiiYon,] upon thisfloor,atthis session,
declared it to be " the highest typo of civiliza-
tion."
New York contains an area of 47,000 square
miles, and Virginia 61,352 squaie miles. In soil,
climate, and natural advantages, Virginiais equal,
if not superior, to New York. At the taking
of the first census, 1770, the population of these
States was as follows: Virginia, 748,308; New
York, 340,320. In the year 1850 the population
was as follows: Virginia, 1,421,661; New York,
3,097,394. The value of real estate in those
[TABL
States in 1850 was: in Virginia, §252,105,824; in
New York, $564,649,649. The value of personal
and real estate was, in Virginia, $391,646,438; in
New York, $1,080,309*216. The value of church
property was, in Virginia, $2,902,220; in New
York, $21,539,561. Virginia had 2,930 public
schools, with 67,353 pupils; New York had 11,580
public schools, with 675,221 pupils. The annual
income of the school fund, in Virginia, was
$314,625; in New York, §1,479,657. The post
office statistics of any country afford good evidence
