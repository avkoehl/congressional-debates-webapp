or by the troops under General Foster, the Twentieth Corps can be spared, and will seal up that sides of the city and be in a position to shell every portion of it. I shall go no further than to send a brigade over to take the line marked 1 until I hear from you; but I have no fear of placing a corps on that side; and this done the fate of the city is sealed. I think Foster's command might be of use in the swamps on this side if placed behind the line already established. I think there are points on the left of my line form which the city can be shelled with those heavy fun to more advantage than on the right of the line. The point held by Carlin, where Mower was, d is within three miles and a half of the city, but there are points nearer the river quite as close, and from which the city can be seen. Please give me your views as to the propriety of attempting to throw one entire corps over. We can send supplies via Argyle Island, which is held by us. The enemy hold the lower part of Hutchinson's Island, and command the whole island, with their batteries on this side. They also send a small gun-boat up to a point between Cruger's Island and Hutchinson's at a point marked B. She has one heavy bun and gives us some annoyance. She is just out of range of our field guns.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
