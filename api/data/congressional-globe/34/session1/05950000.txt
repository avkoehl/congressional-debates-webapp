move that the House take from the Speaker's
table a joint resolution (H. R. No. 26) giving an
increased compensation to the laborers in the
employment of the executive and legislative
departments of the Government, in the city of
Washington, which has been returned from the
Senate with an amendment. The amendment of
the Senate makes the same provision for the
laborers, and also provides for equalizing the
salaries of messengers and assistant messengers.
The amendment in some cases provides for an
increase of salary from $840 to $900. The in-
crease is slight; and I trust the amendment will i
be agreed to. j
The motion was agreed to. j
The bill was taken from the Speaker's table; '
and the amendment of the Senate was reported, !
as follows: _ j

i Mr. FULLER, of Maine. TV ill the gentleman i
' from Virginia yield me the floor tor a moment? i
; Mr. McMULLfX. I yield the floor to hear
from some gentleman who can g<
tion.
Mr. FULLER. 1 -a .11 only say, that o.i a
foimer occasion, it became my duty to crive th>s
subject an investigation. I had a conference m
regard to it with i!k: Secretary of the Trea-smy.
Unless he has changed his opinion smc: thai
time, I know that ho is a\erse to tho pola-y of
building revenue steamers us the sailing revenue
; cutteis are amply sutlicient for all the purposes
, of sea police on our coast. I. therefore, iV one,
: am opposed to this lull.
j Mr. McMULLIX. 1 wiil yield the door to any
other gentleman who v.'di give m«* information.
• Mr/PELTCXe I w ill submit the report ac-
orma.-
compauymji
this bill: and after itshaU lmvc been
read, 1 will ask the po-vious question.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from "V ir-
|| cinia has th>' floor.
j> " Mr. McMULLLNT. I yield to the gent,eman
'' from New \ork tor informaTion.
j! Mr. WHEELER. 1 would like to ask a ones-
li tioi^of my colleague.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Vir-
ginia has the floor, and cannot yield it unless by
unanimous consent.
Mr. McMULLIN. The gentleman from Maine
has just informed the House, that on a former
occasion he investigated this subject, and the
Secretary of the Treasury informed him that it
was not necessary to establish this steam cutter
at the port of New York, as a different class of
vessel answered all the purposes. With that
statement of fact from the gentleman from Maine,
who has given the subject consideration, I appeal
to the sense of justice of this House, and ask
whether it is going to pass a bill of this sort at
this stage of the session ? If it were recommended
by any Department of the Government, and I
thought it were necessary, I would be the last
man to oppose it. I desire now to know of the
gentleman from New York, at whose instance this
bill has been introduced?
Mr. PELTON. Let the report be read.
The report was read, and is as follows:
The Committee on Commerce, to whom was referred the
menioiial of the underwriters, merchants, and ship-owners
of ihe pon of New York, praving that an efficient steamer
n.-3\ be substituted for the sailing leveuue-cutter now em-
ployed in that \ieiiiity, have hdd the same under consider-
ation, and thereupon report:
The mcihouuUbta setfortb that, as well rhe particular In-
tercfts of the revenue seiviee of the United States, as the
, general interests of commerce in the port of New York, re-
fjiuro thai there should he attached to the revenue service,
