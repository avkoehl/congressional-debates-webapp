CONGRESSIONAL GLOBS.
Post Office Department had repaid into the Trea-
sury a million of dol.ars, before advanced to it, this
grant must be assumed to be a repayment of a
Post Office su plus, lodged in the Treasury.
Mr. Wright read documentary evidence in sup-
port of his view of the subj 'c, and called for the
yens and nays on his amendment.
Mr. HENDERSON d J ro' consider it of much
consequence whether the motion prevailed or not.
He (nought, however, it was better to let the bill
staná as it was. He conceived there was j .it as
much right to assuve that ihere was a surp us from
the Post Office to draw upon, a-* ií an account had
been opened in the Treasury tor that Dcuartmcnt,
charging it with al1 advances, an.." spying it cndit,
not alone for the surplus paid in, but for ad the
service-s performed f« r the Government.
The question was then taken on ttie amendment,
and decided in the relative, as folio**.

The bill was then reported Iro n the committee
of the whole, and the question comiu,; up oa the
engrossment for the third reading—
Mr. WOODBURY said thita ¡-ingle fiet was
important to be no ic d before this question vas
pur. We proposed by this  bill to tinow near ba'f
a million of post olhce expenses on ¡he general
Treasury; 'his, too for the first time dur n¿ pear
half a cen'ury. But werj gentl mei a^a a nt ihj
fact, that by so doing we ¡nade the midd in  and

now to nuet ihe del  lene.}, or the lia i. ¡ e, incur-
red on their account, by in  rease 1 tarifl oi roeus
on the nece.ssar e¡, of lite. We impo*e, therefore,
nearly a per capita or poll tax—jiost pirtnl and
oppressive to numbei.s. We do it by an increased
tariff to defray expanses which the mercantile inte-
rest, the banking interest, and p.ofeosional men,
who me the mail most, and besufit by it most,
should ihemselve* defray.   This is unju't
Messrs BATE*, EVANS, and HUNTING-

I     Mr, CALHOUN remarked, that although the
bill was now brought to its passage, no case had
been made out to show that it ought to pass. Sure-
ly the Senate was entitled to far more information
tnan had been given before it oeght to be called
upon to sanction this approp'ia'ion. H- was not
a' ail surprise 1 a' the readiness of the gevleman
oi the other side to vote for any appropriation ashed
for wi houtauy rasons whatever bung furnished.
The one object of all sush apprcprta ions, was
enough for them, that of incieasing the buiden-of
the Treasury wth n view of creat.ng a nece s ty
for high duties. He did not blame them, wuh their
views; they we e quite consistent. Tney, no dotib ,
beloved that the more 'hey put upon the Treasury
the better. Tnis was the foundation of ail their
mesures and that upon wh ch they grounded their
hopes of being abte to wield a maehme tor kfepmg
them in power. They have the largest interest in
the coun ry in the frankmg privilege, and in
the exempt'on of the h ads of Departments
from postage ¡t is a branch oí the macunery by
wnich ihey mean to operate Their constituents,
the bankers and their dependants, have the same
inoie4 m the continuance of their prwi eges.
TJki gentlemen are quite, consistent to themselves
arvel their constitaen's in throwing the burden of
their coirejpcnt'ence upon the pjblw Treasury.
Tney are pursamg the proper line of duty for
iheir cms'ituency, while, at the same tim , they
are carry ng out tneir cvn grand destgn of burden-
ing th* rev nue cf the coun ry so as to render its
iner ase, by augmenta ion of du'^s, inevitable.
But he (rested there were some gentle i en among
them nt t so deeply > ledgid to that pol cj as to vole
tor this bill.
Mr. BENTON moved an amendment to restrict
t .e franking privilege to members of Congress to
tan ty days after tha adjournment of each ses ion,
and with regird to members going out of Co i-
gre*s, to thirty davs after they cea*e being siern-
b rs. Mr Bentun went at great length into
ti: subj ot, and showed tnat undtr ihe
present ar angemrmt the- fr?i,kmg privilege
dunng <-a h brig ieccss opera es so as to give
ntdinb r-, ro; n"g, the sime right f^r nine months
a'ter tie expiraton ot their te in, while, ..t ihe
satue tunc, their successors enj iy the same privi-
lege nine months in ad vanee oí th=ir first session
of service; thus creating a double privdege.and ope-
rating unequa'ly.
Mr, WRIGHT observed th^the would vote for
the amendment with great p casiire. He would
not now propose to amend it, thougb, m his mint),
it did not go far enough To sa'i&fy him fully, it
should go to ?n entire abrogation rf the frankiog
pnvi'cge. The Senator from K ntucky, m the
