scribe the general circulation of bank notes, and
prevent all plea of necessity for issuing smaller
notes Sliver, on the contrary, from Us incon-
venience of transportation, would favor the circu-
lation of bank  notes     Hence  the  birth  of the
I doctrine, that if a mistake was to be committed,
it should be on the side of silver1 Mr Secretary
Hamilton declares the existence of this feeling,
when, in his report upon the establishment of a
Mint, he says* " It is sometimes obseived, that silver
'ought to be encomaged, lathei than gold, as being
' more conducive to the extension of bank circulation,
'from the g> eater difficulty and inconvenience which.
' its greater bulk, compared with its value, occa
' sions m the transportation of it " This passage
in the Secretary's report proves the existence of
the feeling m favor of silver against gold, and the
cause of that feeling Quotations might be made
fiom the speeches of others, to show that they
acted upon that feeling, but it is due to General
Hamilton to say that he disclaimed such a motive
for himself, anci expressed a desire to retain both
metals in circulation, and even to have a gold
dollar
The proportion of 15 to 1 was established The
11th section of the act of April, 1792, enacted that
every fifteen pounds weight of pure silver should
be equal in value in all payments, with one pound
of pure gold, and so in proportiorrfor less quan-
I titles of the respective metals * This act was the
death warrant to the gold currency The dimin-
'shed circulation of that coin soon began to be ob-
servable, but it was not immediately extinguished.
Several circumstances delayed, but could not pre-
vent that catastrophe 1 The Bank of the Umt d
States then issued no note of less denomination
than ten dollars, and but few of them 2 There
were but three other banks in the United States,
and they issued but few small notes, so that a
small note currency did not come directly into
conflict with gold 3 The trade to the lower
Mississippi continued to bring up, from Natchiz
and New Orleans, for many years, a large supply
of doubloons, and long supplied a gold currency
to the new States in the West Thus, the ab-
sence of a small note currency, and the constant
arrivals of doubloons from the lower Mississippi,
deferred the fate of the gold currency, and it was
not until the lapse of near twenty years after the
adoption of the erroneous standard of 1792, that
the circulation of that metal, both foreign and
domestic, became completely and totally extin-
guished in the United States The extinction la
now complete, and must remain so, until the laws
are altered
In making this annunciation, and in thus stand-
ing forward to expose the error, and to demand
the reform of the gold currency, he (Mr B ) waa
not setting up for the honors of a first discoverer,
or first inventor. Far from it He was treading
in the steps of other, and abler men, who had
gone before him Pour Secretaries of the Treas-
ury—Gallatin, Dallas, Crawford, and Ingham—
had, each in their day, pointed outtheerrorin the
gold standard, and recommended its correction
Repeated reports of committees, in both Housea
of Congress had done the same thine Of these
reports, he would name those of the late Mr.
Lowndes, of South Carolina, of Mr Sanford,
late a Senatoi from New York, of Mr Campbell
P White, now a Representative from the city of
New York Mr B took pleasuie in recalling,
and presenting to public notice, the names of the
eminent men who had gone before him in the
exploration of this path It was due to them,
now that the good cause seemed to be in the road
to success, to yield to them all the honors of first
explorers, it waa due to the cause also, m this
hour of final trial, to give it the high sanction of
their names and labora.

' hundred francs, so that it is used almost exclu-
' aively for commercial transactions, and remit-

•dearer, but the only safe, circulating medium,
' and no country that will resort to other means,
' can expect to have a sound and uniform cur-
' rency "
Such (said Mr B ) is the currency of Trance,
a country whose taxes exceed athousand millions
of francs—whose public and private expenditures
require a circulation of three hundred and fifty
millions of dollars—and which possess that circu-
lation, every dollar of it, in gold and silver After
this example, can any one doubt the capacity of
the United States to supply itself with specie >
Reason and history forbid the doubt Reason in-
forms us that hard money flows into the vacuum
the instant that small bank rotes are driven out
France recovered a specie circulation within a
year after the* consular government refused to
recognise papei for money England recovered a
gold circulation of about one hundred millions of
dollars within four years after the one and two
pound notes were suppressed Our own country
filled up with Spanish milled dollars, French
crowns, doubloons, half joes, and guineas, as by
magic, at the conclusion of the revolutionary war,
and the suppression of the continental bills The
business of the United States would not require
above sixty or seventy millions of gold and silver
for the common currency of the people, and the
basis of large bank notes, and bills of exchange,
of that sum more than one-third is now in the
country, but not in circulation The Bank of the
United States hoards above ten millions At the
expiration of her charter, in 1836, that sum will {
be paid out, m redemption of Us notes—will go
into the hands of the people—and, of itself, will
nearly double the quantity of silver now in circu-
lation Our native mines will be yielding, annu-
ally, some millions of gold, foreign commerce will
be pouring in her accustomed, copious supply,
the correction of the erroneous value of gold, the
liberal admission of foreign coins, and the sup-
pression of small notes, will invite, and retain an
adequate metallic currency The present moment
la peculiarly favorable for these measures For-
eign exchanges aie now in our favor, silver is
coming here, although not current by our laws,
both gold and silver would flow in, and that im-
mediately, to an immense amount, if raised to
then proper value, and put on a proper footing,
by our laws Three days legislation, on these
subjects, would turn copious supplies of gold and
silver into the country, diffuse them through eveiy
neighboihood, and astonish gentlemen when they
got home at midsummer, at finding hard money,
where they had left paper Mi B was against
a small paper currency, not against large bank
notes, and expressed a concurrency in much that
was said on paper money by the Senator from
South Carolina, [Mr Calhoun,] though differing
so much on the subject of the national bank
III In the thud place, Mr B undertook to
affnm, as a proposition free from dispute or con-
testation, that the \alue now set upon gold by the
laws of the United States, was unjust and erro
neous, that these laws had expelled gold from
circulation, and that it was the bounden duty of
Congress to restoie that com to circulation, by
restoring it to its just value In this he had the
pleasure to concur heartily with the Senator from
South Carolina, [Mr Calhouv ]
That gold was undervalued by the laws of the
United States, and expelled from circulation, was
a fact (Mr B said) which everybody knew, but
there was something else which everybody did
not know, which few, in reality, had an oppor-
tunity of knowing, but which was necessary to be
known, to enable the friends of gold togo to woik
at the light place to effect the recovery of that
precious metal which theirfathersoncepossessed,
which the subjects of Euiopean kings now pos-
sess—which the citizens of the young republics
to the South, all possess—but which even the free
negroes of San Domingo possess—but which the
yeomanry of this America have been deprived of
for more than twenty years, and will be deprived
of forever, unless they discover the cause of the
evil, and aoply tfte remedy to its root
I have already shown (said Mr B ) that the plan
foi the support of public credit which General
Hamilton brought foi ward in 1791, was a plan for
the establishment of the paper system in our Amer-
ica We had at that time a gold currency which
was circulating freely and fully all over the coun-
try Gold is the antagonist of paper, and, with
fan play, will keep a paper currency within just
and proper limits It will keep down the small
notes, for no man will carry a five, a ten, or a
twenty dollar note in his pocket when he can get
guineas, eagles, half eagles, doubloons, ard half
joes to carry in their places The notes of the new
Bank of the United States, which bank formed the
leading feature in the plan for the support of public
credit, had already derived one undue advantage
over gold, on being put on a level with it m point
oflegal tender to the Federal Government, and uni-
versal receivability in all payments to that Govern-
ment They were now to derive another and a
still greater undue advantage over gold, in the law
for the establishment of the national Mint, an in
stitution which also formed a feature of the plan
for the support of public credit It is to that plan
that we trace the origin of the erroneous valuation
of gold which has banished *hat metal from the
country Mr Secretary Hamilton, in his propo-
sition for the establishment of a Mint, recommend-
ed that the relative value of gold to silvei should be
fixed at fifteen for one, and that recommendation
became the law of the land, and has remained so
ever since. At the same time, the relative value of
these metals in Spain and Portugal, and through
out their vast dommionsin the New World, wherce
our principal supplies of gold weie derived, was
at the rate of sixteen for one, thua making our
standard six per cent below the standard of the
countries which chiefly produced gold It was
also below the English standard, and the French
standard, and below the standard which prevailed
in these States before the adoption of this Consti-
tution, and which was actually prevailing in the
States at the time that this new proportion of
fifteen to one was established.
Mr B was ready to admit that there was some
nicety requisite in adjusting the relative value of
two diffeient kinds of money—gold and silver, for
example—so as to preserve an exact equipoise
between them, and to prevent either from expell-
ing the other There was some nicety, but no
insuperable, m even extraordinary difficulty, in
making the adjustment The nicety of the ques-
tion was aggravated in the year '92, by the diffi-
culty of obtaining exact knowledge of the relative
value of these metals, at that time, in France and
England, and Mr Gallatin has since shown that
the information which was then relied upon, was
clearly erroneous The consequence of any mis-
take in fixing our standard, was also well known
in the year '92 Mr Secretary Hamilton, in his
proposition for the establishment of a Mint, ex-
pressly declared that the consequence of a mistake
in the relative value of the two metals, would be
the expulsion of the one that was undervalued
Mr Jeffeison, then Secretary of State, in his co-
temporaneous report upon foreign coins, declaied
the same thing Mr Robert Morris, financier to
the revolutionary Government, in his proposal to
establish a Mint in 1782, was equally explicit to
the same effect The delicacy of the question,
and the consequence of a mistake, were, then, fully
understood forty years ago, when the relative
value of gold and silver was fixed at fifteen to one
But, at that time, it unfortunately happened that
the PAPER SYSTEM, then omnipotent in Eng-
land, was making its transit to our America, and
everything that would go to establish that system
—everything that would go to sustain the new-
born Bank of the United States—that eldest
daughter, and spem gregis, of the paper system m
America—fell in with the prevailing current, and
became meorpoiated in the Federal legislation of
the day
Gold, it was well known, was the antagonist
of paper, that from its intrinsic value, the natu-
ral predilection of all mankind for it, ita small
bulk, and the facility of carrying it about, would
be preferred to paper, either for traveling or keep-
ing in the house, and this would limit and circum-
*" The present rate was the result of informa-
tion clearly incorrect, respecting the then value of
gold and silver in Europe, which was represented
as being at the rate of less than 15 to 1, when
it was, m fact, from 15 5 to 15 6 1 It would be
better, at all events, to discontinue altogether the
coming of gold than to continue the present sys-
tem The average premium on the American
gold coins, for the last four and-a-half years, has
been about 5 1 6 on the nominal value "—Mr.
Gallatin's letter to Mr Ingham, Dec 31,1829
