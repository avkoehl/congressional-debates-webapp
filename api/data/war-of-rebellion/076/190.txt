The enemy opposed to me, prisoners state,is Gates' [Gist's] brigade, Walker's division, Hardee's corps. As near as I can learn Walker's division is now drawn up in line of battle on the Atlanta road, via Howell's Mill. Prisoners state that the whole of Hardee's corps is in this neighborhood.

HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Peach Tree Creek, Ga., July 19, 1864-6 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have given directions for the whole of Geary's division to cross Peach Tree Creek and establish themselves on the south side of it, and shall bring up Williams' division to support him Prisoners state that that the order was published last night relieving Johnston and putting Hood in command of their army. They do not know that any portion of their forces have been sent to our left. They say that Stewart's (Pold's) corps is on the left of Hardee's, which latter is in our front. They state further that their main line of defense is three miles from Atlanta in front of me, and about two and a half miles in the direction of the Chattahoochee. They state that the assignment of Hood gives great dissatisfaction in Hardee's corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
