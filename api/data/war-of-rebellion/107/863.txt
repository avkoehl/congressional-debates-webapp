Brevet Major General SUMNER,

U. S. Army, Harper's Ferry, Va.:

The commanding general has just returned from a visit to Maryland Heights. He directs me to say to you that he regrets that his time did not permit him to visit Harper's Ferry. He has determined to fortify Maryland Heights and wishes you to furnish such assistance to the engineer officer who will have charge of this work as may be necessary. He has requested the General-in-Chief to send contrabands to Harper's Ferry to perform the labor required, if there are any disposable in Washington. There is nothing new to-day, except that it is believed that the enemy is extending his line of pickets up the Potomac above Williamsport.
