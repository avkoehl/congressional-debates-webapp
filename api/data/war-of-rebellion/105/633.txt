horse equipments, as prescribed in General Orders, No. 15, of 1861, from this office, a copy of which is also herewith inclosed. * The colonel will be mustered in upon the receipt of this order, and is authorized to make all necessary requisitions upon any U. S. quartermaster or commissary for the supply and support of his command. The quartermaster and mustering officer hereby appointed is also authorized to contract for supplies for the regiment at the lowest market price, and to furnish them upon the requisition of the colonel as fast as the companies are mustered into service, provided the supplies cannot be obtained by requisitions upon the U. S. officers, as hereinbefore specified. In all accounts for such expenditures or contracts, the fact must be stated that the supplies could not otherwise be procured, and that the price paid was the lowest market price. The clothing, arms, and equipments, other than horse equipments, for the regiment will be procured by requisition upon the commanding officer of the District of Oregon or the Department of the Pacific. Owing to the great distance between Washington and Oregon these instructions must necessarily be general, but the Department, acting upon the strong recommendation of the Honorable E. D. Baker, Senator from Oregon, relies confidently upon the prudence, patriotism, and economy with which you will execute this trust. Unless otherwise ordered you will be governed by any directions sent to you by Colonel E. D. Baker, and will under all circumstances report your conduct in the premises to the War Department through the Adjutant-General of the Army.

I am, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
