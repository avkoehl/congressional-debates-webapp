A. C. McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Rome, Ga., November 1, 1864.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Send a strong force to Lithonia with orders to break up the Augusta road eastward, burning every tie and twisting every bar of iron around trees, or otherwise rendering them entirely useless. The same party might cover a forage expedition; it should not be out more than five days. Also make preliminary preparations for the absolute destruction in Atlanta of the railroad track depots, car and store houses, shops, and indeed everything that might be used to our disadvantage by an enemy. Five days are all I can allow for the removal of our own property or the accumulation of stores. At the end of that time I expect to run back to Chattanooga all railroad stock, and commence the movement of which you are advised.
