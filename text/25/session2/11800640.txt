But, sir, I hav extended thejse rernai ks already to a length for
which Ifind no justification butin my profound conviction of
theimportanceof thi crisis m ourna'ional affairs, We are, as
itseemsto me, about to rush madly from our proper spheres
We are to relinquish the performance ol our own incumbent
duties to abandon the exercise of essential powers, confided by
the Constitution to oui hands, foi the good ofthe country This
was my opinion m September, it is my opinion now W hat we
propose to do and what we omit to do, are, m myjudsment likely
to make a fearful, perhaps a fatal, inroad upon the unity of
ommerce between these ¡states, as well as to embarrass and
harass the employments ofthe people, and to prolong existing
evils
Sir, whatever we may think of it no v., the Constitution had
its immediate origin m the conviction of the necessity for this
uniformity or identity, in commeic al regulations
The whole histoiy of the country, of everv year and e\ciy
month, fiom the close of the war of the Revolution to 1769,
proves this Over whatever other inteiestsit wat made to ex
tend and whatever other blessings it now doe«, or hereafter
may, confer on the millions of free citizens who do or chalí
live nder its protection, even though, m tune to come, it
should iais<> a pyramid of power and grardeur whose apex
should look down on the loftiest political structuies of other
nations and other ages u will yet be tiue 'bat it was itself thf
CMld of piffs mg commercial necessity Untyand identiry of
commerce among a 1 the States was its seminal principle it
had been 'ound at solutely iraposs'ble to excite or foster enter
pribL in nade, under the influence of discordant and jarting
State regular ns The countiy was losing all the advan ages
of its position Th* Revolution itself was beginning to be ie
gaided as a doubtful blessing 1 he ocean before us was a bar
ren waste No Amencan canvass whitened its bo^om—no
keelsof ©urs ploughed its wateis The journals of the Con
gte^sof the Confederation show the most constant unceasing,
unwearied, but alwavts unsuccessful, appeals to the S ates and
the | eople to renovate the^yt-tem to infuse mío that Confede
ration at or^c aspint ofunion and a spirit of activity, by con
leiring on Congress the power ovei trade B> rothmg but the
perception of its independable necessity—by noth ng but then
cou^ciou res'* <rf suffering fiom its want were the States and
the peop e brought, and hi >ught by slow degree , to imest
this powei   in a permanent <md competent Govern men

In the sime spirit and for the «ame end, was that most im

gates of Virginia on the 21st, day of the following Jvouary Sir,
I read the resolution entne
" Resolzed, That Edward Randolph and otheis, be appoint
ed commissioners, who or any five of whom shall meet such
commissioners as may be appointed by the other States in the
Union, ata ttme and place to be agreed on, to take into con^de
ration the tiade ofthe United States to examine the relative
sitt ations and trade of the said States to consider how fai a

Here, sir, let us pause Let ushrsei at die wateisof the on

series of pioceedmgs so full of great e\ent* to u> and to the
world iSotwith-vtanding the cmbaira^srrent and disues«rf the

attempt tobrmffthe good sense and patriotism of the country
in o ac ion up«n the crisis A solemn assembly was theiefoie

And ow sir what was the exigency'* wim was the cusisT

Commeice ' commer e' is the leeinnms and end of it The
subject to be consHieied and examined was " he relative situ i

o¡ thise\ei memo able resdution the House of Delegates of
\irgima t n the 2lst day ol Tamiary 17^-6 performed the ^tst
act ui the tram of measures which resulted in that Con tituton
u ider the au hority of which you now bit in that cl air and I
have new the honor of addressing the membeisof this body
Mr Preidtnt I am a Northern man I am attached to one of
the States of the North by the ties of birth and pasentage edu
canon, and the associations of early hre, and bv sincere gratitude
for roofs ofpubl c confidence eaily bestowed I am bound o
anothei Tsoithern State by ^doptior, by lore íesiderce by Ml
tne cords of social and domestic life and bv an attachment and
regard springing from her manifestation of approbation and fa
voi, which grapple me to her w uh hooks of stee! And yet, sir,
with the same sincerity of respect, the «ame deep gratitude, the
game reverence, and hearty goed will, with which I would pay a
similat tribute t * cither of th *e States  d I here acknowledge
the Commonwealth of Virginia to be entitled to the honor of
commencing the work of establishing tins Constitution The
how r is hers, let her enjoy it, let her forever wear it proudlyr
there js not a brighter jewel m the tiara that adorns her &row
Let this resolution siandj illustrating her reco ds} and Hassonteg
ber name through al! time •
The meeting, sir, proposed by ¿lie resolution was balden    It
took placej as all know, in Annapolis, in May ofthe same year,
but it was thmiy attended, and its members very wisely adopted
measures to bring about a fuller and moie general convention
Their letter to the States on this occasion is full of instruction
It shows their sense ©f the unfortunate condition ofthe country
In their meditations on the subject, they saw the extent to which
the commercial power must necessarily extend    The sagacity
of Isew Jersey had led her, in agreeing to the original proposi
tion of Virginia, to enlarge the object of the appoiBtment of
commissioners, so as to embrace not only comrr-erciaj legula
tions, but other important matterb    Tnis suggestion the*coi&
missioners adopted, because they thought, as they mform u?t
1 that the power of regulating trade is of such comprehemivt
extent, and will enter so far into the general system of the Fede
ral Government, that to give it efiicacy, and to obviate questions
and doubts concerning its precise nature and limits, might re '
quire a correspondent adjustment oí other parts of the Federa
system "   Here yon see, sir, that other powers, such as are
now in the Constitution, were expected to branch out of the ne
cessary commercial power, and, therefore, the letter ofthe com
missioners concludes with recemmendmg a genet al convention
"to take into consideration the tchol^ situation of tfte United
ftlates, and to devise such further provisions asohouid appear
neceseai y to render the Constitution of the Federal Government
adequate to the exigencies of the "Union
Th"-1 result of the convention was the present Constitution
And yet, m the midst of all thi  flood oflight, respecting its on
gmal objects and purposes, and with all the adequate powers
which it confers, we abandon the commerce ofthe country, ws
betray its mteiests, we turn oui selves away from its most cry
mg necessities Sir it will be a fact, stamped in deep and dark
lines upon our annals, it will be a truth, which in alt time can
never be denied or evaded, that if this Constitution ¡-bafl not
now and hereafter, be so admimsteied as to maintain a uniform
system in all matters of trade, if it shall not protect and regulate
the commerce of the country, in all its great interests, m its fo
leign intercourse, in its domestic intercourse, ini*s navigation,
in us cunency, in every thing which fairly belongs to the
whole idea of commerce, either a& an end, an agent, or an in
strament, then that Constitution will have failed, utterly failed
to accomplish the 39reuse, distinct, original objec, m which
it had its being-
In matters of tiade, we were no longer to be Georgians, ^ ¡r
giiuans, Pennsylvanians, or Massachusetts men We were to
have but one commerce and that the commerce of ihe United
tetates There were not to be separate flags, waving1 o-,ei se
párate commercial systems There was to be one Sag; ihe
b PLuEiBts ukum, and toward that was to be that rally of huí
ted interests and affections, which our fathers had &o earnestly
invoked
Mr President, this unity of commercial legnlation iSjia my
opinion indispensable to the safety of the union ofthe State**
themselves In peace it is strongest tie I care not, sir, on
what side or in which of its blanches, it may be attacked
Every successful attack upon it, made anywhe e, weakens the
whole and rendéis the next assault easier ard more dangerous
\ny denial of its just power is an attack upon it We attack
H most fiercely attack it, whenever we say we will notexer
cise the powers which it enjoins If the court had yielded to
the pretentions of respectable States upon the subject of steam
navigation, and to the retaliatory proceedirgs of othei states,
if retreat and excuse, and disavowal of power had been pre
vailmg sentiments tl en, in what condition, at ihisn oment, k<
me ask, would the steam navigation ofthe country befouiKB
Tons sir to us, his countrymen, t  us, who feel so mueh ¿d
miration for hi*> genius, an ' so much grauu.de for Iti1? terviee=c.
Fulton would havehved almo ' in vam State grar ii>andS(ate
exclusions would have covered over a!l oui watti*
Sir, it is m the nature of «=uch hingi* that the first vioTation,
or the first departure from true principles draws more impor
tant violations or departures after it, and the first surrender of
lustau horny will be followed bv otiléis mo¡e tobe deplored
If commerce be a unit, to break it in one part is to decree its, n!
tímate dismemberment mall If there be made a Sist chasm
thoj^hitbe email, through that the whole wild ocean wil!
pour 111 and we may then throw up embankments m vain
Sn the -pint of union is particularly Uabie to temptation
and seduction, in moments of pea^e and prosperity In war,
thib it int lostrengethentd by a sense of common danger, and
bv a thousand recollections of ancient efforts and ancientglory
m a common cause In the calm*; of a Jong peace, ana the
absence of all apparent causea of alarm things near gam an
ascendency over thmffs leaiotc Ix>cal interests and feelings
overshadow nanonal sentiments Our attention, our regard,
and oui attachment, are every moment so' cited to what touches
Ub tlose*t, and we feel less and less the attraction of a distant
orb Such tendencies, weare bound by truepatnatif=mjandby
our love of union, to resist This is our duty ard the moment,
m my judgment, has arrived when that duty is summoned to
action We hear eruv day sentiments a* darguments, wMch
would hecon e a meeting of envoys, employed by separate
Governments more than they become the commoa Legislature
of a united countrv Constant appeals are made to local mte
terests 10 geographical distinctions and to the policy and the
r ride of particular States h would someumebappear ihat it
was or as if it were, a settled purpose to convince the people
thi our'Umon isi oihing but a jumble of difieientáud dibcor
dant mteiests which must ere Ions, bewail returned to their
original state of separate existence, as if, therefore, it was of no
gieat v alue wkile 11 should last, and was not like'v to last lone
The pioce6>-sof disintegration begins, by urging the fact oí dif
ieient interests
Sir it= not the end obvious, to which ail this leads Ub? Wi 0
does not see that if convictions of this kind take po<=ses?ian oí
the publu mind our Union can hereafter be nothing while it
remains but a connection without harmony, a bond witlnmt
affection a theatre for the angry contests of local feshngs, lo
ral objects, and loca1 jealousies? Even while it continues to
exist, in «ame, it may by these mean*, become nothing but the
mere form of a unitedGovernment My children, artd the chil
dren of those who sit aiound me, may meet, perhaps, m this
chamber, in the next generation but iftendenaeg, now butt©©
obvious, be not checked, they will meet as strangers and aliens.
They will feel no sense of common interest or common coaii
