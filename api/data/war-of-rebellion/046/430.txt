gare's Point. The enemy are threatening us in that direction, and a lodgment effected there in force will turn our present position behind the lines and necessitate the abandonment of the island, or putting its fate upon a battle in the open field, without the aid of entrenchments. To do this, I must have negro or other extra labor and an energetic engineer immediately. I cannot bring this matter too forcibly to the attention of the commanding general.

Very respectfully,

JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
