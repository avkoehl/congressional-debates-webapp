NEW MARKET, June 21, 1864-5.30 p. m.

(Via Chaffin's.)

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Army of Northern Virginia:

If the enemy intends to do more than cover the head of his bridge at Deep Bottom he will probably try to take possession of the hill at New Market. If local troops and reserves are not more than enough to hold Chaffin's Bluff and the left as far as New Market road Colonel Sanford's (Alabama) regiment, Hankins' battery, and a portion of Gary's cavalry may hold New Market for to-night if they can be got here in time. If it is desired to hold this position, if chambliss can be spared for the purpose, or some other brigade of cavalry or infantry, it would be well to send it.

G. W. C. LEE,

Brigadier-General.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, June 21, 1864-7 p. m.

General G. W. C. LEE:

Your dispatch of 5.30 p. m. received. You have been notified that General Heth with two brigades has been ordered north of James River. You must judge of the essential points to hold in order to thwart the enemy in his approach to Richmond. Whatever operations you may decide upon I should hope your force with Carter's artillery could drive the enemy back.

R. E. LEE.

[JUNE 21, 1864]

Major-General PICKETT:

Colonel Gary reports a pontoon bridge across the James River at upper edge of Curl's Neck, opposite Sweeney's just below mouth of Bailey's Creek. A small force of infantry and artillery was seen early this morning moving from the enemy's lines in front of your position near Howlett's toward Jones' farm.

G. W. C. LEE,

Brigadier-General.
