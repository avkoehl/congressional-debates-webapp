HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, July 4, 1863.-7.30 p. m.

GENERAL: The enemy have not yet renewed the attack of this morning. Their loss is much greater than represented in my previous dispatches. Their dead and wounded strewed the bluffs in every direction after the action. Our loss is, as near as can be ascertained, 40 killed and from 100 to 125 wounded.* We are ready for a renewed attack, should the enemy see fit to make it, and we shall do our best to hold him at bay in that event. Our men have done nobly to-day, and can be depended upon to the full extent of our abilities.

The gunboat Covington is here. With a few more troops we can hold the place against any force they may bring.

I am, general, very truly, yours,

B. M. PRENTISS,

Major-General.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps.

HELENA, ARK., July 5, 1863.

Via Cairo, Ill., July 10.

We encountered the enemy, 15,000 strong, under Generals Holmes, Price, Marmaduke, and others, on the morning of July 4, and whipped them handsomely. We have captured 1,000 prisoners, 1,200 stand of arms, and 2 colors. Our total loss will not exceed 250.* The enemy's loss is very heavy, not less than 2,500 in killed, wounded, and prisoners.

B. M. PRENTISS,

Major-General.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., July 5, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the enemy's forces, estimated at from 15,000 to 18,000 strong, under Lieutenant-General Holmes and Generals Price, Marmaduke, and others, attacked our lines heavily at 3 a. m. of July 4. The engagement lasted till 10.30 a. m., when the enemy retreated, having been repulsed at every point with severe loss, and leaving hundreds of his killed and wounded on the battle-field. Occasional skirmishing continued till or 2 p. m., but the attack in force has not been renewed.

We have taken 1,000 prisoners, about 1,200 stand of arms, and 2 colors. Our loss in killed and wounded is about 250.* The loss of the enemy in killed, wounded, and prisoners, as near as we can ascertain, is about 2,500.

The soldiers of my command, numbering about 4,000 effective men, are entitled to all credit for their determined and successful defense of this post. Their bravery and gallantry have not, I think, been surpassed in this war.

The gunboats Tyler rendered valuable assistance in this action. The Covington has since arrived, and I have applied to General Hurlbut for re-enforcements, as the enemy is still in superior force, and is still in the vicinity, supposed to be massing his troops for a renewed attack.
