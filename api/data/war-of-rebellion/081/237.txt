HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE, June 20, 1864 - 12.30 a. m.

General WEITZEL:

From my officers just returned I learn that you except to lay a bridge under fire, and wish it done as rapidly as possible, and that the banks are good. If so, I earnestly recommend my plan of simultaneous lays, but for which 100 men will not be sufficient, but 300 I shall except would lay it in much less than an hour. As I am authorized by General Meade to send what you call for, I will send you 300 men, if you ask for them. Please reply immediately.

General BENHAM:

The bridge will not be under fire, but ought to be laid quick. I think 100 men will do, but if you have them to spare it would help to have 200.
