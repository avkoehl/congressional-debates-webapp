MEMPHIS, Tennessee,

October 20, 1863.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN,

Fifteenth Army Corps:

I inclose you copy of General Grant's letter to me .* I have no doubt the order to Louisville foreshadows the assumption of command on the line of the Tennessee River.

I forward to-day, by telegraph, your requisition for a steam ferry-boat. I am informed that Admiral Porter is pushing one or more light-draught boats into the Tennessee River. From 30 inched to 3 feet may, I think, be counted on in that river, and as soon as the Ohio riser it will be accessible.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, Tennessee,

October 20, 1863.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN:

I know nothing further that in papers of 17th. Meade has fallen back north of Rappahannock. No serious engagement. Five guns and 300 prisoners captured by us. O do not believe any battle to be imminent there.

Grant has gone to Louisville; says there is no charge in orders as to this line or your movements. Direct me to cover all the road practicable. I have to Steele for a brigade; hope it will come soon. Chalmers and Richardson are reported re-enforced from Okolona. This is doubtful, but I shall know to-night.

Letters will come to you. Where shall they be forwarded?

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 20, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

All commissary stores that we have are loaded ready to go to you.

There are 30 cars on the track now; 7 loaded with hard bread. One train of commissary stores will be in to-night for us. We will take off little salt, and send the rest of the train through to you.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, October 20, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I know of no bad news; papers of 16th give none. We had small fight there with Warren's corps, but it was in our favor. Meade is evidently falling back and preparing for a fight. Warren took two batteries and prisoners.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
