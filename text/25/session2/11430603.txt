/¡¡dependent Treasury—Mr. Legare.
H. of Reps,
sis fot our circulation had provecí itself to our very senses to be
completely fallacious We all now see that not a dollar col
lected by the Government and disbursed by its creditors cireu
lates for one moment as money, but is carefully hoarded and
sold as merchandise, and that  will continue to be the case so
ljftg as> from any other causea whatevei, exchangee shall be un
favorable to the country, is equally evident
1 admit that 3ince the fall of the price of gu'd and silver to
five per cent Una objection loses somewhat oí its weight, but it
loses none of its trutn The same taw of currency now operates,
though in a mitigated degiee, to make it an objectionable mea
sure to repeal the act of 1816 aniso to discredit, pío tanto, all
bank notes in perpetuity Yes, sir, to organize panic and per
petuate distrust,so far as your example has any weight And
why do so? What apology have yon to make for an act that
certainly requires one? Whit public occasion, what pressing
exigency requires it? The Message puts the subject, 1 admit,
ma very frpecious and captivating form It suppose the case
of a war, and the Government to find its whole treasure suddenly
turned into bank, credits, and we are asked whethereuch a thing
could be borne But admit that, in the case of wai, the Govern
meat would h¿ driven to that and any other measure of equal,
or even of greater severity What then? Does it follow that
«uch a system should be unnecessarily adopted in tune of peace?
But the truth is that, even in tune of war, it would make less
difference to the Government than is generally &upposed Oi
tamly some of its operations, distant naval expedí none and the
like, would require gold and silver, and they must be had, at
whatever pile, from withm or from abroad, but, after all, with
such credit as that of the United States now is, it is impossible
to imagine that the nation Should be embarrassed even for a
single moment, by the failure1 of its hanks to pay some millions 
in üold aud silver Look at England in the eventful period be
tween the suspension of payment in '97 and the peace of 18X5
It is now universally confessed that that measure, and that nica
sure alone, boldly empn ical as it was once thought, enabled her
to sustain the burdens of that terrible conflict, and to achieve a
triumph worthy of her generous constancy under mi&fortune
I do not, therefoie, set how even the necessities of war would
compel Government, abounding m *uch resources of puolic
credit as no other Government ever enjoyed, to resort to a
measure so novel, so harsh so inconsistent with the esta
blished older of things in the countiy, and with all the habits of
the people
But the great objection with me h that which appeals fiom a
passage quoted by the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Garland j
to hare presented itself to Mr Dallas, m 1815 You will do
some harm by refusing bank paj t-r Considering how little
specie there hub ever been in t us cou itry, you miy, 1 y reqm
ring it to be pud to you in altrge amount annual >, make it
alwiys an article of merchandise, yon v. 11 thus permanently
discredi bank notes, and render impossible the restoration of
their convembiluy But that is not all even should this mi&
chief not ensue, >ou at least, by thus rejecting them to the whole
extent of your transactions, abandon the cuirency to its fate un
der the administration of the States You make no efforts, you
ejiert no influence to maintain us pmity and uniform!tv, hy
distinguishing; between corporations which redeem their notes
and those which are notoriously insolvent You proclaimyoui
distrust of all of them alike—you wnte it m your statute book
However disastious the condition of the monetary conreina of
the States may be, through want of skill or want of concei t, > ou
leave them to themselves, and that vhen, standing in the moot
intimate and die most commanding relation towar s them all,
yon might, if you gave yourselves the least trouble about the
mattet exercise a mo*t salutat y control over them, and lemedy
these great inconveniences for ihe benefit i fu&all For sii, it
is not enough today you have no;)mrPi striLtly so called, under
the Constitution, to regulate the ci rrency I admit that you
Imve none What then? Have you no influence—militen e of
example, influence of precept, influence oí authority, influence
ot patronage, influence of connection and custom in business, in
the u^e of these very deportes? Has not the Consutu ion pro
vided that all defects m our institutions shall be corrected by
amendments regularly recommended and introduced and is it
not one oí youi duties so to recommend and introduce themi
Why do you not urge upon the States any reform \oumiy
judge necessary m the mattei? 1 appeal toevery one that heais
me, what he should think of an individual, who possessing
immense influence in a community, with an income of m iny
m lliontsa year, should, in a time (f trouble coolly withdiaw
himself fiom society, and hoaid hie money, like an usurer in a
commercial panic, waiting u til the extreme necessities of his
neighbors ?hall throw them upon his mercy i Is this, the mo
rabty we are taught in our private relations'* Shall nothing he
expected Irom him *o whom so much ha  been given? Shall
he hide his light undei a bushelí tonall he bury his ten talents
in the earth, and escape ondemnation as an unprofitable ser
vant? And shall that be right m a Government, which, in a
pi irate person, shocks the tnoial sense of all mankind? In a
Govern nent standing towards the pe pie of this country in
lelauonsso very peculiar' Sir, what answer would you have
to give to the States, if, m a moment of public calamity like
that which is just passing awa), f elnag then distresses aggia
vated through your harsh exacttonsof what their people had not
to give, appealing in vain to you for succoi or for counsel, thoy
were to hold to you the language which indignation and asto
mshment would naturally inspire, under such extra rJmaiy en
comstancerf? If they wereto say toyou, ' We have done every
thing to exalt and to magnify yon p have clothed you with
authority and awe, we have aimcu \ m with mighty powei ,
with the axes and faeces of súpleme juusdiction we have sur
losnded you with all glorious equipage and pomp of eirpne,

times alleged that you are, a foreign Government m the midst
of oui country, and even wi'l a/aif yourselves of a moment of
cr lei revulsion and calamity, to make us feel that vou are so m

ought tibe as binding: upon com mum* es as upan the indivi

Agreeing, the , bir, with the Executive in the punciples laid
down in tl e Message, I diflei with it m the practical inference
deducted fiom them In the division of power between the
Government and the States, I think with it, that all that is
riquiicd to meet this emergency has not been given to the foi
nier But the inadequacy of our powers i> no excuse for not
exerting them to the uttermost lor the public good, especially

against which,accoiding to the course of modern lommene,
there can be no complete security, and that nothing can be

But we have been told, sir, that, far fiom being an innova
tion, this mode of collecting the public seventies was miner
sal from the earliest times until the beg3nn ng of the last cea
tury—that is to aay, un*il an age of ph loa (>hic light and di -
