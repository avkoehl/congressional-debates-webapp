Commodore Lanman, U. S. S. Minnesota, has requested me to send troops to aid in an expedition to Pagan Creek, near Smithfield. I sent General Vogdes to confer with him. General Vogdes has sent a small cavalry force to reconnoiter. At present the ice will prevent a boat expedition. In case that General Vogdes and Commodore Lanman should think the expedition advisable, shall I send a force?
