HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, July 6, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: General J. E. Johnston, who had authority to go to Canada with his family, declined going on account of the health of Mrs. Johnston forbidding her traveling so far, and because his authority to go prohibited his return to the United States without authority. He has made application for amnesty, and does not want to risk becoming an exile. He now asks to have his parole extended so as to authorize him to go to Maryland, where his wife's relations reside. I am in favor of so extending his parole, and with your authority will so extend it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

[Indorsement.

JULY 8, 1865.

Approved.
