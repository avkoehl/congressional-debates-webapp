HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 25, 1864.

Colonel JOSEPH DARR, Jr.,

Actg. Provost-Marshal-General, Dept. of the Mo., Saint Louis:

COLONEL: Yesterday I received the inclosed dispatch from Colonel Stone, General Pike's chief of staff, informing me that the bodies of Major Wilson and six men, who were captured at Ironton, Mo., were found fifteen miles southwest of Washington, Mo. To-day I received from Colonel Stone the accompanying books and papers, which were taken was Major Wilson's, Third Cavalry Missouri State Militia.

Captain Digner, Forty-seventh Missouri Volunteers, reports that he was paroled fifteen miles south of Washington and ten miles west of Union, and that Major Wilson was at the same time and place ordered by the filed officer of the day of the rebel army to be turned over by the guard to Tim. Reves, and when he last saw him he was waiting there under guard for Reves to come up.

The facts and papers conclusively establish to my mind the fact of his murder by order of the field officer of the day, and fully justify and call for retaliation.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

[Sub-inclosure.]

WASHINGTON, MO., October 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

The bodies of Major Wilson and six men, captured at Ironton, have been found about fifteen miles southwest from this place on the old State road, near Jeffrey's farm. Major Wilson was shot through the body several times. One of the bodies is supposed to be that of an artillery bugler, from the trimmings on his jacket.
