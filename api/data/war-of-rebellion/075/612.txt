According to Merrill's map, it is about ten miles. Nickajack the only stream to cross. Time for starting, day after to- morrow.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,June 27, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

What force do you think of moving with! If with the greater part of the army, I think it decidedly better than butting against breast- works twelve feet thick and strongly abatises.

Major- General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, June 27, 1864- 9.45 p. m.

General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

If we move on Fulton we must move with the whole army, leaving our railroad, on the chance of success. Go where we may we will find the breast- works and abatis, unless we move more rapidly than we have heretofore.

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Near Kenesaw Mountain, June 27, 1864- 2.40 p. m.

Major- General THOMAS, Commanding Department:

I do not know of any more favorable points of approach to the enemy's lines than those at which General Newton made the assault this morning. He (General Newton) says that the assault was vigorously made, Stanley's and Wood's troops following closely in support. The assault was stubbornly met at every point and was repulsed. General Harker, who was so severely wounded, has since died. Many field officers have been killed and wounded. The enemy's works in my front, so carefully prepared and flanked, can only be carried with great difficulty. I think batteries may be brought to bear upon the works in front of Colonel Grose with considerable effect. I have sent to each division commander for a report as you requested.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major- General.
