HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., December 31, 1862.

Brigadier General J. B. McPHERSON, Abbeville, Miss.:

At Memphis all reports confirm the taking of Vicksburg by Sherman, but no particulars can be obtained. General McClernand and 49 staff officers chartered the Tigress and started for Vicksburg yesterday. Hurlbut thinks the enemy have erected batteries on the river that will prevent him from getting down. Holmes is moving against Helena, but there is sufficient force there to protect the place. General Gorman is moving on Little Rock by steamers. No damage has been done rail road between La Fayette and Memphis.

There has been a great deal of cannonading to-day east of Henderson Station. Hope Sullivan has Forrest in a tight place.

I will try and get down to see you on the 2d.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
