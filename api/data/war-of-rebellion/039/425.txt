In forwarding this report, which I merely do as a matter of duty, it is incumbent on me to say that it is a complete romance from the beginning to the end. Colonel Collis has his attention called to these errors, but refused to correct them.

CHARLES K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIV., THIRD ARMY CORPS, May 17, 1863.

This paper is forwarded, with attention called to Brigadier-General Graham's indorsement. The officer is under arrest on charges of misbehavior before the enemy.+

HDQRS. 141ST Regiment PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS,May 12, 1863.

SIR: In compliance with a circular from brigade headquarters, to send in a detailed statement of the movements of the regiment during the last engagement, I have the honor to submit the following report:

We struck tents on Tuesday, April 28, at 4 p.m., and marched to a point near the river some 2 miles below Fredericksburg, near where this division crossed the river in the engagement of December 20 last, where we remained until the 30th, without anything happening worthy of note.

On Thursday, at 1 p.m., we started, for the United States Ford, and marched about 15 miles, and encamped for the night beyond the Telegraph road.
