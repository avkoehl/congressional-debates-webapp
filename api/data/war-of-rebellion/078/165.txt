Major- General WASHBURN:

I move out this morning with my whole force and send back all surplus stores to La Fayette, and would recommend they be ordered as far WEST as Germantown, if not to memphis.

Major-General WASHBURN, Memphis:

After sending back all the surplus stores from Saulsbury and this point there will be no force to guard the bridges this side of Moscow. I will see everything off before I leave. General Grierson is now delaying me.

Major- General WASHBURN, Memphis:

If, on arriving at Ripley, I find the road further south quite impracticable, and can accomplish as much by going direct to Tuscumbia, am I at liberty to do so!

Major- General.

LA GRANGE, July 5, 1864.

(Received 5 p. m.)

Major General C. C. WASHBURN, Memphis:

All have concluded, with your permission, to go to Tuscumbia and do all the mischief we can on the route, and from that point I can reach Columbus much easier than by the route proposed. From all accounts I can live on the country, avoid the crossing of Tombigbee, and draw Forrest out if he wants to fight. If our services are not immediately needed in other quarters I respectfully request you will approve my plan. I can get subsistence and coffee by the Tennessee, and that is all I want. I think this La Grange an important point, and Hatch can hold it and scout south. My command is all encamped on the road to Ripley to- night.

A. J. SMITH,

Major- General.

LA GRANGE, July 5, 1864- 5. 20 p. m.

major- General WASHBURN:

I send to- night twenty- nne men and forty- eight horses broken down. I will keep one regiment of cavalry here to- night and the construction train that will carry in everything in case you decide to abandon the place. I hope it may be held and a force sent out early in the morning to relieve my cavalry. I now start for camp, but keep the office open until 7 a. m. to- morrow.

A. J. SMITH,

Major- General.
