erals I respectfully request may be given as follows: Gray and King to date from the 8th of April, 1864. Waterhouse and Maclay to date from 30th of April, 1864, to command infantry brigades; Bagby and Gano to date from March 17, 1864; Debray to date from April 8, 1864, to command cavalry brigades.

I recommended the promotion of Colonel W. P. Hardeman, now commanding Third Texas Cavalry Brigade; it is deserved and will give satisfaction. I recommended the promotion of Colonel J. L. Brent, to command the Louisiana Cavalry Brigade, serving in District of Louisiana. It is merited and will advance the interests of the service. The two brigades of Louisiana cavalry, as reported on the return, have been ordered to be consolidated into one efficient brigade of cavalry, commanded by Colonel Brent, the surplus regiments to be dismounted and added to the Louisiana infantry brigades. There is not a colonel serving with the regiments of Louisiana cavalry in this department that I can recommend for promotion. Should the President disapprove my action, and decline to make the appointments requested above, I would respectfully present for his consideration and action the names of Colonel J. E. Harrison, Fifteenth Texas Infantry, and Colonel W. P. Lane, Texas cavalry, as best meriting promotion-the former for an infantry and the letter for a cavalry brigade. I respectfully request that Captain Meem and Major Cunningham may, under General Orders, Numbers 53, Richmond, June 17, 1864, receive the promotion to which as aides-de-camp they are entitled.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.
