Do you patrol the country well to your right? It will be well for you or General Hatch to do so, and to keep fully posted at all time as to Hood's movements. I have your dispatch of yesterday, 3 p. m. Hope most sincerely you may succeed.

JOHN T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SHOAL CREEK BRIDGE, ALA., November 3, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch of yesterday 3 p. m. received. I have just returned from reconnoitering and find the rebel line unchanged. They have a large force of infantry and very little cavalry. I think General Hatch should move at once to Bough's Factory, via Lexington. My force is scattered from the mouth of Elk River to this point, and thence to Bough's Factory, and is so scattered that a small cavalry force would make it necessary for me to concentrate, and thus abandon portion of the road I am watching. If you will send him drown I will report to him and let him take charge of the whole force. Have not heard from the expedition to cut their pontoon bridge.

Respectfully,

JOHN T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
