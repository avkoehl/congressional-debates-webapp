men. On the first page we have the contract
of D. Hudnell for laying pavement and setting
curbs o Pennsylvania avenue, $753 58. That
contract has been extended. Gentlemen may
think that I am making some mistake, that I
have not investigated sufficiently to inform
myself exactly what has been done, or that the
amontit added by these extensions is trivial, or
to be accounted for in some other way. But
they can judge by the result. November 21,
1871, this contract was extended " to embrace
foot pavements and curbs along Pennsylvania
avenue between Madison place and Eighteenth
street northwest," no sum, however, being
given for this addition. May 18, 1872, it was
" further extended to embrace the resetting
of curbs and relaying of foot pavements along
Pennsylvania avenue between Eighteenth street
northwest and Rock creek," no sum being set
over against this either. Now what are the
facts? The bill of D. Hudnell is annexed to
tHfe report, and we find them there. In state-
ment No. 21 of the cost of Pennsylvania ave-
nue from Fifteenth street to Rock creek, we
have the bills of D. Hudnell, given in detail
as audited and paid. This shows one amount
of $23,811 35, and another of $244 80, for
work which in the list of contracts is charged
at only $753 58; so that there is paid to him
really for the work under the contract the sum
of $24,056. In other words, a contract for
$753 58 is swollen to one for more than $24,000.
Here is a trifling discrepancy of thirty times
the pretended expense, and conclusive evi-
dence that the report of the Board of Works
is wholly unreliable.
This is not a solitary case. There are nearly
a hundred in a similar condition. Some are
so mixed up with other work that no estimate
can be made of their actual extent, and never
will be until the board is compelled to " show
its books." But I hold in my hand a list of
sixteen contracts worked out to their legiti-
mate results, but without any desire to ex-
aggerate. These are as follows:
