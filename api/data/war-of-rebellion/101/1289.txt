MEMPHIS, TENN., March 29, 1865.

Major-General GRIERSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

GENERAL: I arrived here last night and this morning called on General Washburn and made my business known to him, showing him at the same time my orders-yours and Colonel Christensen's letters. He told me at once that I could not get the cavalry I asked for. The says he thinks it is needed here more than below and that it cannot go. I told him that I should write to you and inform you of his reply. General Thomas left here only a day or two ago, so, I presume (though I did not feel at liberty to inquire). General Washburn, in his refusal to send this cavalry, was acting under General Thomas' orders. I shall leave here this morning, as I can accomplish nothing by remaining, and go at once to Louisville, where I expect to see General Thomas, when I will urge upon him the necessity of sending these regiments down. If I do not see him, I will at least communicate with him by telegraph and get his final orders.

I am, general, very respectfully,

C. J. WALKER,

Captain, 2nd Cav., and Special Inspector of Cav., Dept. of the Gulf.
