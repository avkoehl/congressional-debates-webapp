HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF TEXAS, &C.,Houston, March 23, 1864.

Brigadier General H. P. BEE,

En route to Louisiana:

I am instructed by the major-general commanding to inclose to you a copy of General Orders, No. 220,* from these headquarters, regulating the quantity of transportation for the army, for your information and guidance, and to say that you will rigidly adhere to the provisions of the order. The order allows, as you will perceive, fifteen wagons for a cavalry regiment, independent of the supply train. The major-general directs that you reduce your baggage as much as possible, and all excess of transportation which you quartermaster may have over and above what is allowed by inclosed order be turned over to the officer of field transportation whom Major Burke will send up to inspect the transportation of your command. The wagons belonging to the ordnance train of Major Fontaine, chief of ordnance, in the possession of your brigade quartermaster, will at once be turned over to the officer referred to above, and will not be taken from this district under any circumstances. There are certainly as many as seven of these wagons, and perhaps more of the ordnance transportation. All these, as well as any surplus transportation above the order, will be turned over as above indicated. Please answer this communication as early as possible.

Very respectfully,

E. P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
