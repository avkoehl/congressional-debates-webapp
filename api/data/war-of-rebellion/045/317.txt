HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 25, 1863-3. 45 p. m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

It seems to me that the best point for Lockwood to await orders is at the Monocacy railroad bridge. With regard to the batteries, I have this morning ordered into Washington fourteen, having more batteries than I have infantry to guard them. I have had artillery for 200, 000 men, and have but 75, 000 at all reliable. In my opinion, Milroy's men will fight better under a soldier. I have telegraphed General Halleck for men until I will do so no longer.

Major-General.

General ABERCROMBIE:

The major-general commanding directs that you leave your pickets on the Occoquan to-day, and withdraw them to-night in time to join the column at Gum Springs to-morrow morning.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 25, 1863-6. 30 p. m.

Major-General FRENCH, Harper's Ferry:

Please order your men to have three days' rations cooked and kept on hand for the present, supplied with ammunition, prepared to march at a moment's notice. I have not heard a word from your post to-day. If there should be and considerable force remaining there, I should like to make a dash at them. By feeling, if not without, can you find out if they are there, or that they continue to cross? I should like to learn this to-morrow. My headquarters will be at Poolesville 9 a. m. to-morrow.

HOOKER,

Major-General.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

I am here. The troops are on the march by the routes I telegraphed you. The trains are not all across the river yet. I don't think the troops can get farther than Barnesville and the mouth of the Monocacy to-night.
