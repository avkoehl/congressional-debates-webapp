JULY 10, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

What is the state of affairs this morning? Do you hear anything of Hobson or Judah? Has the battery arrived from here yet? Have the troops from below arrived, and where is Colonel Moore? Don't fail to send back the Seventy-first Indiana and the battery if you become satisfied that the rebels are moving north. Hobson must pursue rapidly and overtake Morgan. Report soon. Answer in cipher.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 10, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

If the 2,000 Indianians are all organized, and you are satisfied that they will in good faith pursue the enemy, you can, of course, issue them arms, taking receipts of the different commanders. You can also issue arms and ammunition to all the volunteer organizations in Louisville whenever you feel that the emergency requires it. Whatever you may do, you may be sure that I will sustain you. I know that your own good judgment and your faithful attention to the interests of the public service will prevent you from making an unnecessary and wasteful issue of public property. I am much pleased with your plan of organization of citizens in Louisville, and approve of all you have done.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 10, 1863.

General BOYLE:

It is reported that the enemy will try to cross at Westport or Grassy Flat. I have sent Sanders, with two cavalry regiments, to Eminence, on the Lexington and Louisville road, and will instruct him to obey your instruction. He has a battery. It is very important that two or three gunboats should keep plying between Madison and Louisville, to keep the enemy from crossing.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, July 10, 1863.

General HARTSUFF, Stanford:

Some 150 to 200 rebels, cut off by General Hobson, are near Bardstown. If General Judah would come to some point on the railroad, part of his command could move by rail, so as to be of great service. Morgan is on back track, and will strike river at Madison or between here and Madison. I will endeavor to intercept him.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, July 10, 1863.

General HARTSUFF:

Wires all cut in Indiana. Morgan's force reached the railroad. I cannot communicate with General Burnside. Can you inform me when
