HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, Jamumy 13, 1834
The petition of Noah Fletcher coming up in its
order—
Mr DAVIS, of Massachusetts, rose, and after
referring to the postponement of any action on the
petition when first piesented by him, said that,
although he did not agree that the rules of the
House under which it was postponed had been
always uniform, yet that he had acceded to it,
because he had every desire to accommodate the
House, and not entangle it with a contention about
the rules of their proceed nigs   He would not now
go into an elaborate view of the subject, and had
neaily closed what he had to say upon it, when
on thefoimei occasion the member fiom Alabama
[Mr Clay] had interposed by his objections, that,
undei the rule of the House, the subject could not
then be discussed, but he would merely remaik
now, as he did then, that the petitioner was a per-
son in an humb'e situation of life   he had been a
laborer in the service of the G-ovetnment for nearly
the whole of his life, and of which foarteen or fif-
teen years had been passed as a subordinate officer
of the House, that he had discharged his duty so
far, as he had reason to believe, in a satisfactory
rnanner.fomoconvplaint had been prefei led against
him    Under such circumstances it, howeter, ap-
peared that he had been removed from the office
■which he so filled by the fiat of power, he had been
removed by vutue of an mstiument with which
they had become latterly somewhat familiar—an
instrument m writing, a little paper, un"eremoni-
ously addressed to the object, beginning " I," not
the House, "have no fuiiher occasion for your
services "   This, then, being the mode m which
one of their agents foi  the transaction of their
business had been dism^ed, and without previous
admonition, he thought it was a duty incumbent
upon the human character, wherever an exercise
of power had been made in either an offensive
manner, or in a way to piove injurious to oui fel-
low creatures, that the party was called upon to
lay before the world some justification for such m
juhous or offensive exercise, some plausible apol-
ogy for the conduct puisued     But was such the
case here'   No, it was not pretended that there
was any charge against the petitioner, and nothing
but this brief notice of dismissal was sent to braf
being thus dismissed, his plans in life altogether
broken up, this act, too,, being done by an officer
whoholdsandexercises thatpowerfrom the House,
it became their duty to see by what authority the
act had been done   Whether the power was legally
or illegally exercised was not so material, it was
enough for them if the power was exercised un-
justly or improperly to entitle them to call upon
the individual thus exercising it    The House, he
contended, had this power in their hands, and they
could not go forth to their constituents and say
they witnessed such an exercise ot power as was
displayedm this instance withoutaffording ledress
No apology having been made feu it, the natural
inference was, that the power had been exercised
in a prescriptive manner    And here he was in-
duced to consider what was proscription'   It was
the power of a tyrant, it was the power which saia,
" Think as 1 think," " Do as 1 bid you "    Does
the Autocrat of all the Russias demand from his
humblest serf more than this'   What coald the
Sublime Porte itself require of the humblest slave
'within his realms than, Think as I think, act as
I wish '   Th.s was the very essence of tyranny
This  spirit  it  was which, with  powerful arm,
grapples and regulates and guides everytmng as it
pleased, which made the man foi the place, and
not the place foi theman    This was proscription,
this was the spirit which addressed itself to the
ambitious man, and says, Give ud your indepen-
dence or your place shall be forfeit, to the avari-
cious it says, You must barter vour conscience for
gold, and this it was which addressed itself to the
hungry and to the naked, saying, Be ye warm,be
ye fed, be ye clothed, but be ye also of my faith
Ihis was the true character of proscription, to
avoid which, it would seem, that eveiy man upon
entering into office, must ciaw! to the footstool of
its known disposer, and fiist undeisign and seal,
give bond by which he will engaged to become the
¡slave of that power    This was one effect of pro-
scription, but not the worst     If they wanted to
see its effect upon the proscribed, they need not
tiavel out of the present case, theeaseof an hum-
ble individual, who would not be peimitted to sit
in a private chambei of the Capitol, there to enjoy
even the puvilege of neutrality, but he must be
bound to bark and to hunt tor the power winch
employed him    There was another view of all
this, which seemed to him to be still more offensive
and more obnoxious to public justice    He was led
to consider who was this " I," who said " i have
no occasion for your services "   The gentleman
in the office of chief cleik need not suppose that
these remarks were intended to be personal, for
they were not so    Mr  D  would not apply them
so, as he now believed that this officer had acted
inconsiderately rather than from any other motive
in the matter     But, in considenng the effects of
the system, and who the personage was who thus
claimed this power, they would find that it was
one whom they bad elevated into an office, con-
nected with which was the powei to use all the
money of the House, and all the vast patronage
which that money couid give as a capital to trade
upon, and if this was so, m truth and in Tact, was
it not time that such a power was taken out of the
hands of their chief officer    The salaries at his
disposal amounted to some twelve or fifteen tbous
and dollars, and being so large it was in thepower
of any band of men to conspire together to elevate
whom they pleased to the office, and then have the
pptionage to trade upon, but he trusted that the
House would not tolerate such a system     He
knew the character of the petitioner to have been
without spot or blemish, and as he claimed it as a
right to have his petition presen'ed, he (Mr D )
had presented it as a duty due, rot only to him,
but, under the circumstances, to the whole country',
and in a manner as little offensive as possible
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, «aid he must claim the
attention of the House for a few moments on this
all important question, (as the gentleman from
Massachusetts seemed to considei it,) particulaily
as he had been íeferred to m the course of the le
marks which had just been made He ought to do
so, (Mr C said,) if it were only for the mere pul-
póse oí rendering some suitable apology for having
called the gentleman from Massachusetts to order
when he presented the memor al the other day
Mi C said the gentleman had not been satisfied
to accompany the presentment of the memorial
with "a bnef statement of the contents thereof "
as the iu'e of the House required, but was going
on to declaim at large upon the freedom of the
people, and the safety of the citizen He(Mr C)
had thought this course a depaiture from the rule
of practice in such cases, and an unnecessary con
sumption of time, and had, therefore, called upon
the Chair to inteipose To require a member to
conform to rules, adopted for our governmert and
the ordeily tiansaci'on of business, certainly de-
manded an apology'
I had supposed, Mr Speaker, the House had
sufficient business to occupy its time and aueition,
and sufhcient matter for excitement, too, at least
for the present, without the introduction of this
.most unnecessary, if not unprecedented question
It seems to me, sir, that any one will be satisfied,
on the least examination, or the slightest reflection
that the memorialist has no claim to the interposi-
tion of the House, founaed either upon it¡> practice
or the law of the country It may serte to occupy
the time of the House, which all must agree to be
so precious, and so much demanded by legitimate
subjects for its consideration, and it may serve to
produce some excitement, which may be desirable
in these calm and quiet times
But the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr
Davis ] who introduced the memoiial with so
much pure benevolence and deep pathos, disclaimed
any intention to excite the feelings of gentlemen by
any remaiks he had made Far from him ' He
J only wished to do justice to an injured individual,
an oppressed American citizen ' No, sir, it was
not his purpose
" To stir men's blood "
He only showed the supposed wrongs of Mr.
Fletchei—
poor, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them peak for him '
But, notwithstanding the gentleman's disclaimer,
if it had so happened that the eloquence of those
" dumb mouths" had roused a general feeling of
indignation, likely to overwhelm the object of his
assault, he would doubtless have been ready to
exclaim with his gieat prototype,
-----------__« >lischief, thou art afoot,
Take ihou what course thou wilt "
But, si>, what is the ground assumed and set
forth by the memorialist, upon which he claims
the interposition of this House > It consists in his
having been appointed about fourteen or fifteen
years ago, and having ever since quietly held the
office, and enjoyed its emoluments, ergo, he is en
titled to it the remainder of his life This, sir, is
the sum and substance of Mi Fletcher's claim,
he has held the office so long that he now believes
his title indefeasible The claimant, in this in-
stance, however, is not the only one who has ar-
rived at the conclusion that oncegetting into office
in this District gives & freehold tule That notion,
Mr C believed, prevailed extensively, not only
in reference to clerkships and other offices in the
House of Representatrv es, but to all the oncers in
the several Departments it remains to be seen
whether the House will give sanction to the claims
of such tenants.
The gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Da-
vis,] however, was not satisfied to rest the claim
of Mr Fletcher upon the ground set forth in his
petition He urges the additional consideration
utllu PetItloner'3 long residence here, duimg
which he has made investments in property in tms
District, and that he has here contracted the pri-
vate relations of husband and father For all this
good fortune, the gentleman would seem to con-
clude that the petmonei should hold his office for
life If a man has held an office many yeais, itis
a good claim, according to this, new doctrine but
if he shall have had the good foi tune, in the mean
time, to get married, and to get rich, forsooth, it
is much better—it is an indefeasible freehold, at
least Why, sir, acquiesce ir this doctrine for a
few years more, and we shall have office claimed
here by inheritance The son of Noah Fletcher,
or some one else, who has settled here, obtained
a good office, got married, been blessed with chil-
dren, and has realized a fortune, will come forward
and claim the place which was held by his father
And could he not sustain his claim ? Yes, sir,
with as much plausibility as the gentleman ñon
Massachubetts sustains that of the father He
would only have to add to the family history, with
which we have already been favored, by saying
he had been bom here, raised and ed icated here,
perhaps brought up m his father's office, and ac-
customed to its duties, unaccustomed to any other
business, and unacquainted with the manneis and
