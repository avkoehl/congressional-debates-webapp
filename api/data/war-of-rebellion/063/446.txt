Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE H. HOYT,

Olathe, Kans.:

Notify commander at Aubrey and have company at Shawnee Mission ready to re-enforce Oxford or Aubrey; if necessary, to send into Missouri. Major Anderson, Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, left here to take command at Aubrey to-day. Do you know how the troops are posted in Missouri?

Captain J. L. THOMPSON:

Co. B, 15th Kans. Vol. Cav., Coldwater Grove, Kans.:

CAPTAIN: You will probably receive orders from Colonel Moonlight soon to organize an expedition from your company and the company at Rockville to go into Missouri, between the Grand River and the Marais des Cygnes River, to the neighborhood of Hope's and Wilson's near the mouth of Elk Creek, south of Dayton.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

PAOLA, KANS., May 4, 1864

Colonel THOMAS MOONLIGHT,

Mound City, Kans.:

The troops should be sent from Rockville and Coldwater Grove, I think and go down between Grand River and the Marais des Cygnes. Elk Creek empties into Grand River nearly opposite Dayton. I would rather not send unless you could go to Rockville and see Captain Thompson first. Answer.

THOS. J. McKEAN,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.

PAOLA, KANS., May 4, 1864

Colonel THOMAS MOONLIGHT,

Mound City, Kans.:

Organize the expedition from Coldwater Grove and Rockville yourself. Captain Thompson had better probably take command.

Lieutenant Murphy is sick.

THOS. J. McKEAN,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.

Colonel THOMAS MOONLIGHT.

Mound City, Kans.:

On your suggestion, Captain Thompson will be instructed from here not to move on your order until he hears further from you.

THOS. J. McKEAN,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
