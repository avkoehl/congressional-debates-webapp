APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Ho. oe Reps.
Union Pacific Railroad—JReport.
42d Con*}....3bSess.
When you made, in behalf of the
Union Pacific Railroad Company, the contract with
Mr. Oakks Ames as contractor, you expected that the
transaction which you have now described would bo
the substance of the transaction that would take
place, did you not?
"Answer. Substantially."
This contract extended over one hundred
and thirty-eight mile3 of road completed and
accepted. No work was done under it until
after its assignment. That portion already
completed had cost not to exceed $27,500 per
mile, and by embracing this one hundred
and thirty-eight miles in it these trustees
derived a "profit," if such a term is admis-
sible in such a connection, which enabled
them to make a dividend among the stock-
holders in less than sixty days after the
assignment, namely, on the 12th of Decem-
ber, 1867, as follows: sixty per cent, in first
mortgage bonds of the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, $2,244,000; sixty per cent, in
stock of the Union Pacific Railroad Company,
$2,244,000.
This was mainly, if not entirely, derived from
the excess of the contract price over what the
one hundred and thirty-eight miles had cost.
The trustees proceeded to construct the road
under this contract, and from a balance-sheet
taken from the books it appears that the cost
to the
Railroad company was $57,140,102 74
And the cost to the contractors was  27,285,141 99
Profit $29,854,141 99
The nature of this profit, as in case of that
on the Hoxie contract, will appear' hereafter.
The next step in construction was under what
is known as the
davis contract.
This was a contract made with J. W. Davis
a man of but little, if any, pecuniary ability,
(and not expected to perform the contract) for
the construction of that part of the road begin-
ning at the western terminus of the "Ames
contract" and extending to the western ter-
minus of the road, a distance of one hundred
and twenty-five and twenty-three hundredths
miles. It was upon the same terms as the
Ames contract and was assigned to the same
board of trustees. Under it the residue of the
road was constructed, and from a balance-sheet
taken from the books of the railroad com-
pany it appears that it
Cost the Bailroad company $23,431,768 10
And from a balance-sheet taken from
the books of the trustees, that it cost
the contractors  15,629,633 62
Profit  $7,802,084 48
Your committee present the following sum-
mary of cost of this road to the railroad com-
pany and to the contractors, as appears by
the books:
Cost to railroad company.
Hoxie contract $12,974,416 24
Ames contract  57,140,102 94
Davis contract  23,431,768 10
Total  93,546,287 28
Cost to contractors.
Iloxie contract §7,806,183 33
Ames contract 27,285,141 99
Davis contract  15,629,633 62
  50,720,058 94
42,825,328 34
To this should be added amount paid
Credit Mobilier on account of fifty-
eight miles  1,104,000 00
Total profit on construction $43,925,328 34
The balance-sheets, from which the forego-
ing results have been obtained, were made out
by Mr. Crane and Mr. Ham, accountants
familiar with the books and with most of the
transactions. Your committee have earnestly
endeavored to get the exact cost of the road
to the company and to the contractors ; and if
they have failed, it is because those who should
know, and have had the opportunity to inform
the committee, have failed to give the inform-
ation. The books have been kept in such a
way, and the transactions have been of such a
character, as that their true nature has been
very much disguised.
It is a matter of no little importance to
know what the cash profits of this construction
have been, and in this connection the follow-
ing summary is presented on that subject.
The attention of Mr. Ham was called to the
fact that the balance-sheets above alluded to
showed an aggregate profit on the Ames and
Davis contracts of $37,657,095 43, and he was
asked the question how much of it was money,
how much bonds, and how much stock. His
answer gave the following exhibit:
$3,777,000 first mortgage bonds at ninety
cents  $3,399,300
$4,400,000 certificates for first mortgage
bonds, afterward converted into income
bonds at  4,425,000
$5,841,000 income bonds at sixty cents  3,486,600
$24,000,000 stock Union Pacific Railroad
Company   24,000,000
$2,346,195 cash   2,346,195
Total $37.657,095
Prom this it will appear that in making up
this profit all the securities are estimated at
their cash value, except the stock, which is
estimated at par.
This shows that the profits on these two contracts
are—
Bonds, (cash value) $11,310,900 00
Twenty-four million stock, at thirty
cents  7,200,000 00
Cash  2,346,000 00
™ 20,856,900 00
The profits on the Hoxie contract, as
before etated, were 86,272,232 71
Treating all of this as stock, except
$1,125,000 of first mortgage bonds,
divided as hereinafter stated, the
profits, cash values on this, would bo
as follows:
$l,125,OOOiirst mortgage bonds,at eighty -
five cents  965,250 00
$5,147,232 71 stock, at thirty cents  1,544,169 81
Total cash profit   $23,306,319 81
In making this calculation the stock is
placed at thirty cents, because that is the value
the parties have placed on it.
If all the profits made have been divided,
the dividend account should correspond with
the amount of profits above stated. But it
does not correspond, and whether the failure
to correspond is attributable to inaccuracy as to
the amount of profits or to disguises in making
divisions, the House can judge in some degree
from the facts hereinafter set forth.
The following are the dividends as appears
in the evidence. First, by Credit Mobilier,
results of Hoxie contract:
The Credit Mobilier on the day of Jan-
uary, 1867, increased its capital stock from
$2,500,000 to $3,750,000, and for each $1,000
of additional stock taken, there was distrib-
uted to the subscriber a first mortgage bond
of the Union Pacific Railroad Company,
of $1,000. In this way there was divided
$1,125,000 in first mortgage bonds.
Then on the  day of , 1867,
there was a dividend made of twelve per cent,
(six per cent, for each of the years, 1866, and
1867,) in stock of the Union Pacific Eailroad
Company, at thirty per cent, of its par
value. This would amount to $1,500,000
stock par value.
These two amounts aggregate $2,750,000.
But the balance-sheet shows a profit to the
Credit Mobilier—
On the Iloxie contract of $5,168,232 91
Add amount received on fifty-eight
miles  1,104,000 00
Total $6,272,232 91
This shows a discrepancy of $3,522,232 91.
But, that the above dividends are delusive, and
are not all that was divided is disclosed by the
testimony of Mr. Ham, pages 277-383, to
which attention is especially called.
Mr. Ham was asked what amount of profit
was made by the Credit Mobilier on the Hoxie
contract and what they had received on the
fifty-eight miles west of the one hundredth
meridian. ' ' *
"Answer. The amount of profit they have re-
ceived is $6,272,232 91."
After stating that of this amount $1,125,000
was divided in first mortgage bonds as above,
in his further examination as to the disposi-
tion of this profit (see pages 377-383) it ap-
pears that the whole of the profit above stated
was divided.
So it is apparent that much more has been
distributed on aecount of this Hoxie contract
among these stockholders than what the divi-
dend statements would indicate.
2. The following are the dividends, as ap-
pears from the books that were made out of
the proceeds of the Ames contract:
First dividend December 12,1867, of sixty per cent.,
in first mortgage bonds  $2,244,000
Sixty per cent, in stock Union Pacific
Bailroad Company  2,244,000
Second dividend January 3,1868, of twenty
per cent., in first mortgage bonds  748,000
Third dividend Juno 17,1868, of forty per
cent, stock Union Pacific Kailroad  1,500,000
Sixty per cent, cash  2,250,000
Fourth dividend July 3,1868, first mortgage
bonds  2,791,500
Fifth dividend July 8,1868, in cash  1,095,168
Sixth dividondDccomber29,1868, in stock, 7,599,000
Total .$20,471,668
Here, it will be observed, is another large
discrepancy between the dividend account and
the amount of profit made, as shown above.
Whether this difference has escaped under the
cover of some fog into the pockets of these
managers, as was obviously the case under the
Hoxie contract, or whether the books show
too large a profit, your committee will leave
the House to judge.
The Ames and Davis contracts having been
essentially the same, the accounts were so kept
that it was difficult to separate them and know
exactly the profit on either—this is the testi-
mony of Mr. Hatn and Mr. Crane—and a part
of the profit charged to this Ames contract
may have been divided under the Davis con-
tract, as it will hereafter be seen that under that
contract a division was made of largely more
than the profit par value of the stock divided.
next the divisions under the davis contract.
The mode of making divisions under this
contract was this:
-, 1869, thetrustees sold to the
Union Pacific Bailroad Com-
On the day of-
stockholders of the
pany—
2,750 first mortgage bonds for $275,000
2,750 land grant bonds for  275,000
Total $550,000
They distributed to the persons to whom these bonds
■were sold in stock two and one half times the
amount of bonds purchased, namely, stock Union
Pacific Railroad Company $1,375,000 00
2. The trustees sold stockholders 3,901
income bonds at eighty cents to the
dollar, amounting to $ , and divi-
ded stock Union Pacific Railroad
Company  7,802,000 00
3. The trustees sold stockholders 1,909
income bonds at eighty cents to the
dollar, and divided stock Union Pa-
cific Bailroad Company  3,818,000 00
Total stock $12,995,000 00
This is a division largely in excess of the
profit on this Davis contract in stock par
value, as shown above ; but as before indi-
cated, this excess may have been carried from
the Ames into the Davis contract.
This excess of profit over the dividends
appearing on the books in all probability was
disposed of in some such way as was used in
the disposition of the Hoxie profits.
Mr. Ham having given the amount of
bonds, stock, and money embraced in this
