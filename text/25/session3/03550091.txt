Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout—Mr.Fry.

months Mi Fleming, the Auditor, says there
were about ten thousand of these bonds, exceed-
ing $o 000,000 in amount, that the deficit in that
account commenced m 1837, and that no suspi-
cion existed with him that any portion of them
had been paid, and the money abstracted Now,
sir, I have nothing to say to gentlemen whose
votes extended, for nine months, the time of pay-
ment on these bonds But, sir, there can be no
doubt but that extension of credit upon these
bonds gave Swartwout the opportunity to double
the amount of his depredations, while the Aud-
itor supposed their payment was suspended At
page 26, we find mentioned that an item, under
tne name of "cash retained for refunding mei-
chants," amounting to $bO,7G9, was retained by
the collector, undei the act of Congress for the
relief of the suiTereis by the great fi e m New
York So that, by the acts of Congress, and not
by the negligence of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, was he enaoled to cany on his system of
plunder to its final consummation Sir, I op-
posed these extensions at the time, because, as I
then stated on this floor, I would make the mer
c lants pay their taxes when they were due, the
same as the farmer and mechanic aie made to
pay t'iens The money thus paid by merchants
is all levied upon the consumer and paid by the
consumer, and theie is no more reason for in
oulgence in that system of collecting taxes than
in any other Let the Government adopt an
entire system of cash duties, and it will not only
1 e relieved fiom much and frequent embanass
rnent, but will avoid many serious losses, and
what wid be of equal, if not greater, impoitance
to the country, it will put a check upon excessive
importations
Sir, the history of this stupendous defalcation
& not to be overlooked, its origin can very easily
be traced to the effects of a bloated circulation of
papei money, against which the untiring efforts
and united exeitions of the Democratic paity have
always been dnected Sir, the policy of tne Dem-
ociat c party has ever been, not to depress or de-
stroy paper money, but we always have seen and
felt the crying necessity for some limit to its cir
culation, so as to secure the people of the country
against those revulsions m tiade, in commerce,
and in all the fiscal concerns of the Government
and the country generally, which are the never
failing eílect of such a circulating medium
Mr Swartwout was a speculator Mr Ogden,
the cashier, in his examination, (p  20,) stated
' That Mi S had been a large speculator in
' stocks, that he had known his operations to have
' amounted to some hundred shares a day thatne
' had been 1 irgely a loser by the failure of the To
' sephs, that he knew he had loaned them ¿25 000
' a day or two before their failure, and that he had
* made immense purchases of land in Texas, ' ¡i>_
For aught that appears, Mr Swartwout came
into that office an honest man, but, living in a city
where speculations in stocks of every kind, m
lands of no value, in paper cities, and all that kind
of humbug, were carried on to an extent mciedi
lie—why, he, too, thought he m gnt be specula-
tor, and, for that purpose, might use tne public
money, and perhaps return it again
fair, 1 have thus shown that Mr Swartwout
was engaged lrispeculations I nave shown in what
manner he was enabled to abstract the money, and
keep his accounts apparently coirect with the
Tieasury, and the means employed, so as to pie
vent detection by the Secretary of the Treasury
and that the acts of Congress enabled him, as I
before state i, to double his depredations, (for his
deficit is stated to have been on the 31stof Decem-
ber, 1836, but $336 718,) and then I want the
House to point out, 1 wish gentlemen to lay a fin-
ger upon, any part of the transaction for which
the Secretary of the Treasury should be held re-
sponsible
Su, it is known here that there is a mucn larger
number of Opposition men in office, m the seveial
Denartments nt the Govemmert, than the people
have any id a of Cut what is to be di ne with
them  If von turn one out, why then the cry of
proscr p ion, proscnpt on foi opinion's sike is
raised, and we aie caded persecutes and the spoils
party, and this cry is leiterated by eve y Opposi-
tion paper in the country     W ell, sn, if you leave
them in, in many instances, the first opportunity
they get to lay hold of some of the public money,
they fill then pockets full, and then burst, and
come out public defaulters, and then the cry of
corruption and mismanagement is immediately
raised against the Executive, so that the Execu-
tive, do as he please, cannot avoid censuie
Sir, I do not concern myself much aboutit, who
is in office, or who is not, but, did it depend upon
I my wiH, I should make oreeffectual general sweep
fiom Dan to Beer^heba    Not because 1 do not
believe there may be Opposition men in office who
may be valuable in their stations, notfoi opinion's
sake, no, sir, but in self defense     If the Admin-
istration is to be censured for every Opposition
man who iuns away with the public money, then
1 hold no Opposition man should be continued m
offirte     I have no doubt theie are Opposition nen
enough who would purposely run away with the
public money if they thought they could injure or
break down the Administration by it, then, sir,
why should they be continued in office  
|     Sir, this defalcation in New York, it seems, is
to be the great center of action about wmch the
Opposition will gather all their force, and the great
lever by which they expect to move heaven and
I eaith     Sir, let me ask, is this Government to col
lect all  its money without losing any'   Let me
I look at home for a moment, sir     My district is
| composed of a single county  m that county, some
$40,000 or f.50 000 is annually collected and dis
bursed under the supervision of three commis- i
sioners     Nov , sir, our people are as honest and
industrious,and as able to pay their debts, as those
of any other district represented on this floor, yet
notwithstanding all that, and notwithstanding the
utmost vigilance on the part of oui  county com-
missioneis, money is frequently lost, either by de
faulting collectors or a defaulting treasuier, and I
have no doubt the same thing happens m other
counties     Well, sn, if, then, in a single county
in Pennsylvamawe have now and then a default in
the collection of our revenue, and if there it is im-
possible to get along without occasional losses,
I how much more impossible for this Government,
I with some twelve or fifteen thousand collectors oí
I public money, stretched over this vast country'
i I say, how much more impossible is it for this
Government to get along without frequent losses
| Sir, it is entirely out of the question, the Govern
ment  may take  every precaution, may use the
utmost vigilance, and still yearly, and every year,
theie will be losses
Mr  Speaker, although this money is lost to the
Government, 't i  not lost in such a «ay as to em
bairass the piesent operations of the Ireasury,
because it is money that n°ver came  into  the
Treasury, it was abs raet"d before it got theie
and,  consequently,  no   appiopnation,   nor  any
other expense, was based upon it     If it had been
m the  Treasury, and formed  a part of the esti
mated expenditures, its amount would necessarily
have to be replac°d     As it is, it need not   and it
is the same with the Government as with an indi-
vidual—it is nevei so hard to lose motley wh ch
you never had, as to lose it out of your pocket
I allude to this, however, more particularly, in
I ordei   to  call  the attention  of our Conservative
friends, who say they only differ from us so far as
I that the public money, after collection, should be
placed in banks, and not with officers appointed
| specially to take charge of it     Now, sir, in this
' case the public money was taken before it got to
i the bank, and how is your pet ban <  system to
I reach a ease of this kind >   Sir, it will not reach
such cases, and I think I have a ngnt, then, to
call upon our Conservative fnends to join with
us and pass the Sub Tieasuiy bill, and make it
a penitentiary offense for men to use the public
money, and then we shall be able to do the coun-
try some service, and effectually prevent these de-
falcations in our public officeis
Mi Speak i, it ti e gentlemen who are panting
for this investigation had at once taken a committee
and gone to work, they might probably have, by
this time, 1 een ab'e to r°-w but, for some cau«e
oi other, they aie not willing to take the comm't-
tee constituted in the usual manner and foi the
first time since £ have Leen a member here,aom
mittee is to be chosen by ballot Well, su, vvny
that'   Why, a geitlen.an from Vitgmia, [Mi
Roeektson,] gets up here and makes a most vio-
lent attack upon the Speaker for improper conduct
in the appointment of the land committee, raised
a few days since, and gave as a reason that bib
colleague, [My Baj-ks,] who was Speaker of the
Virginia House of Delegates for twenty-one years,
always gave a majority of a committee favorable
to the proposition submitted to them Why, sir,
is the Speaker of this House, before he appoints
a committee, to go about among membeis, and
ascertain their private opinions upon subjects 
S r, I should think not And who complains of
this land co nmittee, except the gentleman from.
Virginia' No one, that I have heard If the
Speaker has done injustice to any of the States in
the apDomtment of tnat committee, let the mem-
beis from such States use and declare it, it is not
competent for the gentleman fiom Virginia to ex-
cept for all Sir, I will not speak for more than
my own State, but in that I venture 1 have not a
colleague here who will not say that the interests
and feelings of Pennsylvania will be faithfully
rep-esented by my distinguished friend and col-
league [Mr Potter] on that committee Another
gentleman, over the way, seems to havean anxie
ty to relieve the Speaker from the responsibility of
appointing this eommittee I have no doubt of
the gentleman's kind intentions toward the Speak-
er, but it will be tine abundant to relieve the
Speakei from responsibility when he asks for it
But, sir, there may be something at the bottom
of this attack upon the Speaker which does not
at once appear Theie is an election to take place
next summer in Tennessee, and the Speaker is to
be a candiuate foi office Now, sir, the Repub-
lican party in Tennessee may be about to right
itself again, and the Speaker may be a formidable
candidate m the apprehensions of gentlemen, and
hence it maybe thougnt necessaiy indirectly to
hunt him down, by making an attack upon him
foi misconduct in the appointment of the land
committee, then to follow it up by taking out of
his nands the appointment of this committee of
investigation, and then cuculate it wide and far
in Tennessee that the House had lost its confi
dence in the Speaker, and had, therefore, to elect
their important committees Dy ballot Sir, the
official conduct of the Speaker in this House is
too far beyond the leach of repioach to need any
defense by me
Mr Speaker, some days ago, during this de
bate, my friend from Massachusetts, [Mr Cush-
ing,] in speaking of an executive's committee and
a people's committee, said, in very emphas zed
terms, " we will hate a people s committee " Well,
sir, the manner of my Inend's expression caused
me to tüíe some thought of what he said, and 1
came to the conclusion, then, that there had at
readv been a counti lg op noses between the Whigs
and C">n«n values,and that they had come to the
concl ision that the} could outvote us, and elect a
cunrmt'ee by ball it We", su, one thing, then,
is certain, and ih it is, the same power that can
mange the manner of laismg a committee can
e'ect tne membeis. of that committee, and i have
s nee had no doubt, it they elect, they will form a
ticket oi nearly all Ooposmon men, composed of
Whigs and Conservatives Should they do that,
Í have on y to say, " ike Loid help Mi Wood
buiy '" Such anothei beatmg as he will get from
that committee no man ever had and I can only
tell his friends and himself topiepare for u
Sn, the Opposition mus^t make something out
of this defalcation, it is their last hope, it does not
only involve their political prosperity, but their
political existence, it is a case of lite or death
with them The country has outlived their bank
panics,and their bank pressmes have fallen before
the energies of the nat on, and now, unless they
can effeU something out of this Swartwout busi
ne«s, their doom is sealed The late elections
show it the feelings of the people show it, their
own acts show it, and nowheie they have resolved
to make one other clesr erat°efTbit, a death stiusgle,
to hunt down ti j Admimstiahon, by hold ng up
to the view of the peiple this Svva-twout de'a ca-
t on, and all the def ' a ions hat have taken ¡.lace
since the Govern nent has nad existence Sir, it
is easily fjietoll to v hat lengths mem wil' go
when tnus situated In such case necessi y nil
be a virtue, and misrepiesentation no sin     But,
