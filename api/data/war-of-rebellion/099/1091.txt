Telegrams from Generals Hardee and McLaws report enemy crossed Broxton's and Rivers' Bridges over the Salkehatchie, forcing General McLaws back toward Branchville. He was flanked on both sides. Fighting was sharp at Rivers' Bridge. General Hardee has made dispositions to hold railroad as long as possible, but says will not be able to hold it much longer.
