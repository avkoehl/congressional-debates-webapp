GENERAL: General Torbert reports this a.m. that you are at Smithfield or Middleway. You report at 4 a.m. to-day that you will remain at Martinsburg and wait for the enemy, falling back, if necessary, to Williamsport, which is all right. Make frequent reports to the commanding officer at Harper's Ferry.

Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL,Commanding Cavalry Division, Martinsburg, Va.:

GENERAL: Two dispatches from you have been received to-day. All right. Follow the directions I have given heretofore. I do not consider it safe to notify you by telegraph of the position of the troops. Our cavalry is well out toward Winchester. Communicate with me by express and keep me advised of any movement of the enemy in your direction. Have you a cipher operator?

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling:

It is reported that Early has been largely re-enforced and is advancing again on Martinsburg, General Sheridan's force falling back toward Harper's Ferry. The term of service of most of my force has now expired, and the officers and men are determined to go home. Some active measures must be taken to have troops sent me or West Virginia will be overrun.

General KELLEY:

General Averell is going back by way of Williamsport. He is on Williamsport road. I have no news of the enemy's intentions or doings.
