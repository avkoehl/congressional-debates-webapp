The Attorney General placed in my hands $12,500
for the purpose of defraying the expenses of prose-
cuting the investigation within the late insurrec-
tionary States. Of this sum $10,000 have been ex-
pended as follows: $1,848 have been advanced to
members of the sub-committees on account. The
balance of the $10,000 has been disbursed for the
payment of witnesses and the expenses incurred m
procuring their attendance, the salaries and per-
sonal expenses of clerks, and the personal expenses
of the stenographers and the assistant sergcants-at
arms.
I have in my-hands $2,500 to be returned to the
Attorney General's office, with the$10,000 expended,
as soon as the appropriation asked for shall have
been made by Congress. In a foi rner statement, sub-
mitted to the Committee on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives, I informed them that the
Attorney Gener.il advanced the amount referred to,
out of the $50,000 appropriated for the prosecution of
crimes, as per act of March 3,1871, with the under-
standing that the amount should be returned to that
fund out of a future appropriation.
The $10,000 expended, the indebtedness incurred
by the two sub-committees of the joint committee,
while in the States of Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
and Mississippi, but not yet paid, and the estimated
cost of reporting testimony taken in said States, also
the expenses of the sub-committee which remained
in Washington, make the amount of $27,845 given
in my former statement as the unpaid liability of
the committee.
