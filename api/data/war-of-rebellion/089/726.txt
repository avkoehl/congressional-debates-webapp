This would give us the Second and Fifth for a movement, leaving the Ninth to hold the lines. The Second Corps has been so long in their present position it is entitled to be relieved, and the Ninth Corps is the one I should prefer having in a defensive position.

Major-General MEADE:

The movement which I spoke of for Thursday next will not take place, owing to the change of plan, which I will tell you of when we meet. It is advisable, however, that the Fifth Corps should be got out of the line ready for any emergency.

Major General W. S. HANCOCK:

The order for Colonel Morgan to report to you has not been issued, but his leave of absence has been extended ten days. You will have to procure an order from the Secretary of War transferring Colonel Morgan from the Second Army Corps, so as to leave his position in that corps vacant, that it may be filled by General Humphreys, otherwise he will have to remain with the corps.
