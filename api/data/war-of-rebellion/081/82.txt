Brigade and battery commanders will see that the troops are properly distributed throughout the breast-works on their immediate fronts, and will take every precaution to prevent surprise. The commanding officers of the One hundred and thirty-second, One hundred and thirty-third, and One hundred and forty-second Ohio National Guard will continue to make report through their regular brigade commanders, who will transmit them all orders. Colonel Abbott, Seventh New Hampshire Volunteers, will have charge of these regiments, so far as defending that part of General Kautz's line on which they now are, and in making all details for fatigue.
