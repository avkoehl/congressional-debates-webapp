From present appearances the end is drawing near. Banks' cavalry is almost destroyed. His troops are disheartened, sullen, and disinclined to fight. He is short of provisions and almost entirely without forage. All captured horses are like scarecrows and show want of forage. Sickness prevails to an unprecedented extent, and as he has no means of removing the sick or wounded much depression is caused among the well. The lower river is still falling slowly. I scarcely need repeat that it will be held to the last extremity against an attempt to open it.

Your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Colonel S. S. ANDERSON,

Asst. Adjt. General, Trans-Mississippi Department.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST LOUISIANA, In the Field, near Cheneyville, May 12, 1864.

COLONEL: Yesterday the enemy moved a heavy column of troops down the west bank of the river, and reached a point 14 miles below Alexandria, where they were attacked by Hardeman's brigade, of Major's division, and driven back 7 miles. No change on the Bayous Robert or Rapides, where some slight skirmishing has taken place. Two iron-clads are lying near Fort De Russy. Since yesterday morning our sharpshooters have been shooting every man that exposes himself on board, the gun-boats replying whit heavy shelling without danger to us. The Mississippi is rising very rapidly, and will soon overflow the country east of the Atchafalaya through the Morganza crevasse.

Your obedient servant,R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

COLONEL: The enemy left Alexandria after midday to-day, burning the place. Two houses only reported left between the ice-house and railroad. Heavy fighting all day with gun-boats and troops. Steele's division in their rear; Polignac, Major, and Bagby in front and on flank; Harrison, re-enforced by Likens' regiment, on north side of Red River. We have experienced some loss, but will continue to fight them to the bank of the Mississippi, and beyond, if possible.
