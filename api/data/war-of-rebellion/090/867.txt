HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,August 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILSON,

Commanding Third Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I had already sent to Harkins to send out a patrol and see if Merritt's brigades were on the Berryville and Winchester pike. The patrol reports quite a wagon train passing on the Berryville and Charlestown pike guarded by infantry. The scouts have been sent out toward the Martinsburg pike with directions to go to Martinsburg if possible.

Respectfully,

J. B. McINTOSH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,August 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHAPMAN,

Commanding Second Brigade:

Please take measures at once to ascertain the truth of the report sent in by Colonel Moore, sending out proper scouting parties toward the Martinsburg and Winchester pikes. If they cannot cross the Opequon directly, let them work in by Middleway or to the north of it. I want the whole line of the creek examined, the size, position, and movements of all rebel pickets reported. One good regiment should be sent. You must ascertain whether or not the enemy is using the Martinsburg pike, and by what forces.

Very respectfully

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF HARPER'S FERRY,Harper's Ferry, Va., August 20, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

GENERAL: I send you copy of report* of scout made by Loudoun County Rangers as far as Leesburg. By it it would seem that there is no movement of enemy in direction of Leesburg. I have ordered another scout for to-morrow as far as Aldie; shall promptly report result. A cavalry picket strong enough to make a scout through Keyes' Gap should be stationed at Keyes' Ford. You can find men in Cole's. (First Maryland) cavalry familiar with the country. Nothing from Averell.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Charlestown, August 20, 1864.

General AVERELL:

Your dispatch just received. There is no indication of movements on my front. The enemy appear to be at Winchester and this side.
