highly injurious to the public service to discharge here a regiment for the most part in a state of disaffection I have ordered the regiment to Albany, N. Y., there to await the arrival of an officer to be designated by you to muster it out, and I respectfully request that you will please detail an officer for the purpose.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

No. 126. Camp near Tunstall's Station, Va., May 20, 1862.

When forage is found in the vicinity of the line of march of this Army, brigade quartermasters, after leaving three months' supply for the subsistence of the owners and their families, including slaves, at the rate of a bushel and a half per month for each person, are authorized to take the remainder for the use of the Government animals.

An accurate account will be kept of all the forage thus taken and receipts given to the owners or their agents for the same, which accounts will be paid on presentation to the chief quartermaster of this army; provided the owner takes the oath of allegiance to the United States; if the oath is not taken, the accounts will be left for future settlement by the Government authorities. No other persons except those herein mentioned will be permitted to take property of any description from the people of the country without special authority from these headquarters.
