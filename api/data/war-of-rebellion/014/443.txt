HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PENINSULA,Lee's Farm, April 15, 1862.

Brigadier-General EARLY,

Commanding Third Division:

I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to inform you that as Major-General [D. H.] Hill has represented that the weak points near Redoubts Nos.4 and 5 may be pressed by the enemy, in that event you will call upon one of the brigades of Brigadier-General Toombs' division to re-enforce you. The position of this brigade will be in the rear of Colonel Winston's division.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. ALSTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PENINSULA,Lee's Farm, April 15, 1862.

General HILL,

Yorktown:

SIR: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to say that you can retain the negro force which you have. Major Ramseur will be ordered to take charge of the batteries of Redoubts Nos.4 and 5.

There has been no change except that a rifled piece of Captain Nelson has been ordered to Gloucester Point and a piece of Captain Page has been ordered to Yorktown.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. ALSTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PENINSULA,Lee's Farm, April 15, 1862.

Brigadier-General McLAWS,

Commanding Right Flank, Curtis' Farm:

SIR: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to acknowledge your letter of to-night,* and in reply to say that it was not intended that you should prepare to oppose the crossing of the enemy below Minor's. You acted rightly, therefore, in removing the guns from Minor's. The mistake arose from the use of "Brick House" for "Brick House Creek."

The commanding general directs that in erecting fortifications at Brick House Creek you cause the defensive works to be made on the left flank from Green's to the road, so as to force the enemy to pass under the heavy guns at Mulberry Point. These works he directs you to cause to be constructed as rapidly as possible.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. ALSTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE PENINSULA,Lee's Farm, April 16, 1862.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Williamsburg:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that General Johnston has telegraphed that some cavalry and artillery are marching down from Richmond
