APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[June 29,
24th Cong....1st Sess.
Cherokee Treaty—Mr. Haynes.
Ho. of Reps.
« reason of many purchases of land made of Indian |
•titles, without the preceding allowance or subse- i
"qnent approbation of this Assembly; which, to ,
' remove, // is hereby enacted and declared by this
• Assembly, and the authority thereof, that all lands
•in this Government are holdcn of the King of
' Great Britain as the lord of the fee, and that no
' title to any lands in this colony can accrue by
•any purchase made of Indians, on pretense of
'their being native proprietors thereof, without
' the alloirance and approbation of this Assembly."
Other acts were passed by the colonial Legisla-
ture of Connecticut, relative to Indians, in 1717,
1722,and 1750; but the foregoing will show most
clearly that the colony assumed unlimited con-
trol over them and their lands.
In the year 1700 the colony of Pennsylvania
is believed first to have exercised her jurisdiction
over the Indian lands; and her legal records show
tinder that date "An act against buying land of the
Indians," which contains the provision, " that if
' any person presume to buy any land of the na-
' lives within the limits of this province and ter-
• ritories, without   leave from   the  proprietors
• thereof, every such bargain of purchase shall
• be void, and of no effect." In 1721, she passed
"An act to prohibit the selling of rum and other
' strong liquors to Indians, and to prevent the
•abuses that may happen thereby,    reserving '
" that the Governor and council, or persons by
' them authorized and appointed to hold treaties
' with tiny nation of Indians, may, at such treat -
' ies, give any reasonable quantity of rum, as by
• them shall be thought necessary, anything hcre-
' in contained to the contrary notwithstanding." '
And I find that in the year 1744 colonial Penn-
sylvania assumed the jurisdiction for which Geor-
gia has within the last six or seven years been so
much derided by some, and passed "An act for
the speedy trial of capital offenses, committed by any
Indian or Indians in the remote parts of the province.''
In this act it is provided "that all murders,man-
' slaughters, homicides, felonies, and offenses
' whatsoever, and accessories of the same, which
' by the laws or acts of Assembly of this province
' are declared capital, or felonies, punishable by
• death, which already have been committed, perpe-
' trated, or done, or shall hereafter be committed,
' perpetrated, or done, by any Indian or Indians,
' within this province, in places remote from inhab-
itants, as aforesaid, all and every such offense
•and offenses, in whatsoever place and county the
• same hath happened or shall happen, shall hence-
' forth be inquired of, heard, adjudged, and deter-
' mined before the justices of the supreme court,
' or the justices of the courts of oyer and terminer
' and generalgaol delivery, to be held in the county
'of Philadelphia, by indictments, inquests, and
• verdicts to oe taken of good and lawful men,
' inhabitants of the same county, in like manner
' and form as if such capital offense or offenses
' had been committed, perpetrated, or done within
' the said county, any law or usage to the contra-
' ry thereof in anywise notwithstanding."
There is, in this last act of the colonial Legis-
lature of Pennsylvania, one feature which shows,
that however well the general doctrines of crimi-
nal law might have been understood in that day,
the injustice of passing ex post facto laws does not
seem to have been duly considered. New Jersey
entertained and exercised jurisdiction over Indian
lands so early as 1703, as appears by an act of
her Legislature, passed on the 13th of December
of that year, entitled "An act for regulating the
purchasing of land from the Indians;" by the
second section of which it is enacted, "That if
' any person or persons shall presume to buy,
' purchase, take gift, or mortgage, or lease, of any
' land contrary to this present act, he or they so
' offending, shall forfeit forty shillings, money of
' this province, for each acre of land so obtained,"
&c, &c. Maryland exercised jurisdiction over
the Indians within her limits,by legislative action,
at different times between the years 1704 and 1723,
inclusive; North Carolina, in 1715 and 1748;
and New Hampshire also in 1715. The latter
State, in the year 1715, passed " An act to prevent
and make void clandestine and illegal pxirchases of
lands from the Indians," by which it was enacted,
" that all deeds of bargain, sales, lease, release,
• or quit-claim titles, and conveyances whatso-
' ever, at any time or times since the year of our
' Lord one thousand seven hundred, without the
' license or approbation of the General Assembly
'of this province; and all deeds of bargain and
' sale, titles, and conveyances whatsoever, of any
' lands within this province, which hereafter shall
' be had, made, obtained, gotten, or procured,
' from any Indian or Indians, by any person or
' persons whatsoever, without the license, appro-
' bation, or allowance of the General Assembly
' of this province for the same, shall be judged
' in the law to be null, void, and of none effect, to
' all intents and purposes, as though they had
'never been made." South Carolina exercised
jurisdiction over the whole Indian country within
her limits as early as the year 1739, by enacting
that no purchase of lands from the Indians should
be made but by the King of Great Britain, or
the colonial Government, on the pain of forfeit-
ure. In 1786, that jurisdiction was inforced to-
wards the Cherokees, by assigning them, tem-
porarily, a tract of country for their occupancy;
and in 1808, entire sovereignty was exercised by
that State over the Catawba Indians.
Thus stood the jurisdiction of the colonies
which have been mentioned, in reference to the
Indians within their several limits, at the com-
mencement of the American Revolution. This
subject has not been passed in review before the
House in an unfriendly spirit, or for the purpose
of criminating any one of the States to the early
legislation of which I have thought it necessary
to advert; but to show, from the most unanswer-
able evidence, that the same jurisdiction, and in
some instances more than is exercised by Geor-
gia, was exercised and inforced by the early
legislation of a large number of the original col-
onies. I do not know, if the proper means had
been within my rea^h, that I might not have dis-
| covered similar evidence in the history of all. It
j cannot matter in what manner entire sovereignty
' and jurisdiction may have been exercised by any
\ one of the States in her colonial or present condi-
tion; the fact of its exercise is all, that is wanting
to justify Georgia in exercising her rightful juris-
diction by their example. It thus appears that
the American Revolution found the colonies in
unrestrained exercise of jurisdiction over the In-
dians within their respective limits. I will now
proceed to show that such jurisdiction has not
been limited or restrained in any manner, either
by the Articles of Confederation, or the present
Constitution, except in the single particular of
regulating commerce with the Indian tribes; and
that if the claim to exclusive legislation over them
is set up under that grant of power, it may with
equal propriety be set up as against the States of
this Union: andifitcanbesupportedagainst them,
this is indeed a Government without limitation
of powers.
It might be sufficient for my argument to show
that, although Indians have remained embodied in
most of the original thirteen States ever since the
Declaration of Independence, no authority has
been claimed for the General Government, either
under the Articles of Confederation or the present
Constitution,even for the exercise of the commer-
cial power over them, much less the odious usurp-
ation of exclusive legislation, as attempted to be
set up against the State of Georgia. It has been
already shown, that many of the colonies exer-
cised, under the authority of their charters, entire
powers of legislation over the whole extent of
their limits, long before the Declaration of Inde-
pendence; that they derived these powers over
the countries included in their charters from the
British Crown; and it is fearlessly asserted, that
the jurisdiction of Georgia, under her charter,
was as unlimited as the rest. To show this, it is
only necessary to refer to the proclamation of the
King of Great Britain, in 1763, wherein the coun-
tries in possession of Great Britain, within her
colonies, and occupied by Indians, were reserved
under " her sovereignty, protection, and domin-
ion." Itis true, that the "sovereignty, protection,
and dominion" claimed by the King of Great
Britain was said to be for the bencfi^of the In-
dians ; but it is not the mode of its assertion or exer-
cise that is at issue between Georgia and her ene-
mies, but the sovereignty actually asserted and
exercised by Great Britain throughout the whole
extent of her American colonics, and which
passed to each respectively, fully and completely
upon the establishment of their independence and
its acknowledgment by Great Britain, saving and
excepting as it had been curtailed and abridged
by the Articles of Confederation, and subsequent-
ly by the Constitution.
But how have the original powers of the re-
spective States been affected by the various acts
which, for all external and many internal pur-
poses, have made us one people? The first act
of union was the Declaration of Independence;
and as its acknowledgment by Great Britain
operates retroactively, it will be proper to in-
quire whether the Declaration of Independence
modified in any manner the power or authority
of the several colonies within their limits. It
bound the colonies to a common and the holiest
cause, the vindication of their liberties against
the odious oppression of the mother country.
But, except this pledge to fight out the battle of
liberty to the last, it is not perceived that tie Dec-
laration of Independence modified in the slightest
degree the internal jurisdiction of the several
States; nor do I believe that the contrary opinion
can be sustained foramoment. Then, agreeably
to what has already been shown, the potver and
jurisdiction of the several States, at the acknowl-
edgment of their independence by Great Britain,
was precisely what had been asserted and exer-
cised by her authority within their limits, except
so far as they had been limited and restrained by
the Articles of Confederation.
I will now endeavor to show how far the entire
sovereignty, conquered for the several States from
Great Britain, has been affected by the Articles
of Confederation, or the Constitution, which has
since been substituted for it. But as the subject
under consideration relates exclusively to the
jurisdiction rightfully belonging to the State and
Federal Governments with respect to Indians, I
shall confine my inquiries and illustrations to that
subject, adverting to other portions of our organic
law only so far as it may serve to throw light
upon this.
In illustration of my subject, I shall remind
this House that, by the second article of Con-
federation, " each State retains its sovereignty,
'freedom, and-independence, and every power,
'jurisdiction, and right which is not by this Con-
' federation expressly delegated to the United
'States in Congress assembled." In the distri-
bution of powers conferred by that instrument
upon the United States, it is further provided, in
the fourth paragraph of the ninth article, that
" the United States in Congress assembled shall
' also have the sole and exclusive right and
' power of regulating the trade and managing all
' affairs with the Indians not members of any of
'the States: Provided, That the legislative right
' of any State within its own limits be not ín-
' fringed or violated." Thus, in point of princi-
ple, was the power of the Confederation over the
Indian tribes, with respect to their government
within the States, left precisely as the parties
found it. Great Britain claimed, and for every
purpose of her interest or convenience, exercised
entire sovereignty over Indians within the limits
of her colonies; and most of the colonies, with
or without reference to her sovereignty, exercised
unlimited control over them; and the Declaration
of Independence and its acknowledgment by
Great Britain placed the respective States in pos-
session of all the power ever claimed and asked
by her; that power was entire sovereignty and
legislation over the Indians, which, within the
States, was not impaired or diminished by the
Articles of Confederation, but is expressly saved
by the proviso to the power conferred on the
| Union in respect to the Indians. The best expo-
sition of a law is to be found in the uniform and
long-continued mode of its inforcement. Apply-
ing this rule, there is no difficulty in determining
that the several States understood the Articles of
Confederation in the sense which I have given to
it, as they continued to exercise the same juris-
diction over Indians which they had exercised in
their colonial state, and that was, complete and
entire sovereignty. In addition to the numerous
i examples of colonial legislation already brought
to the  notice  of the House, it may be further
