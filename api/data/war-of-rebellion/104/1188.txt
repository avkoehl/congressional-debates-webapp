HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 1, 1865.

Brigadier-General COCKRELL,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General Liddell directs that you fill the whole line of skirmish pits with the men of your own brigade, as they are the only ones here that can be relied upon thoroughly, and in all probability the enemy will endeavor to take these works by storm, and therefore it is necessary to have the best men in those pits.

I am, general, very respectfully,

H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - General Liddell furthermore directs me to inform you that, in obedience to orders from General Maury, he will remove Ector's brigade from Spanish Fort to-night, in order that the brigade may rejoin you by daylight, if possible.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 1, 1865-9.50 p. m.

Brigadier-General COCKRELL,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General liddell directs me to say to you that if you ascertain that it is advisable to make a dash at the enemy to-night, he would be pleased to have you do so, as we might have to make the same move under worse circumstances, and suggests that you use for the purpose a rather small but reliable force. As you know where the subterra-shells are planted, you can caution the force moving out against them.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 1, 1865.

Brigadier-General THOMAS,

Commanding Brigade:

GENERAL: General Liddell directs me to inform you that the force of the enemy now in our front is composed principally of negroes, and will not spare any of our men should they gain possession of our works. In view of the above, he directs that you station your men in the rifle-pits, and impress upon their minds the importance of holding their position to the last, and with the determination never to surrender. General Cockrell is here and desires me to inform you that upon consulting with General Liddell he has decided not to place his men in your pits, deeming it best for your own men to occupy the pits in your front, placing six men in each pit.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
