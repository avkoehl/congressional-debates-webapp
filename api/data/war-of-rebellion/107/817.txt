HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

Camp near Rockville, September 11, 1862-12.05 p. M.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: General Franklin reports last night that the rebels, with a force of about a brigade of infantry and twleve pieces of artillery, resisted General Pleasonton's attempt to carry Sugar Loaf Mountain. He is to make a reconnaissance this morning, and to carry it if possible. It has been reported here that the mian rebel army extends from Frederick to Liberty. It will be necessary, therefore, in your movement of to-day to look out well for your right and rear, to move with great care, feeling your way cautiously, and being always ready to concentrate witih Sumner if it should become necessary. Pleaes inform the commanding general what you thinkof the propriety of moving Sumner on Urbana, as soon as you obtain the infromation requisite to enable you to judge. Report often to this place by telegraph, and also by special messengers to Middleburg and Clarksburg, as the commanding general may be at either one of the three places to-night. Also communicate with Sumner at Clarksburg, and Franklin at Barnesville, by telegraph (Franklin will forward dispatches to Sumner from Barnesville). In case you reach New Market inform them of the fact at once, when they will immediately move on Urbana, and Couch will move to Barnesville, and Williams to the same vicnity, but between Sumner and you. General White, at Martinsburg, reports to General Wool this mornign that 15,000 rebel cavalry, artillery, and infantry passed through Boonsborough last night in the direction of Hagerstown.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
