Interference Tn Elections—Mr. Preston.
Senate.
and a war was waged by means of these resolu-
tions against this Government and its office hold-
ers, on the part of the States and their office-hold-
ers, to prevent the interference and encroachments
of the general authorities. And yet the doctrines
of this report are laid down now to establish the
principle that this interference is praisewoithy,
that xt is the duty of the General Government to
make it, and that it is desirable in every respect
That is the principle, and it is attempted to be
established on the ground of our second bill of
rights — the resolutions of 1798 — because that
secured to all equal rights All this is the result
of the fundamental and irradicabie mistake that
the officers of this Government are the true peo-
ple. That radical mistake, owing to the school
in winch gentlemen have been nurtured, never
can be worn off, that the office holders and the
Government are the people, and in prescribing
the rights of the office-holders and the Govern-
ment, they have but to make a tianscuption of
the rights of the people.
But who aie theoffice-holdeis' Are theoffice-
holdeis the people' The report goes on the
giound of piotecting the guairantied lights of the
people But aie they the people, in any mean-
ing of the terms ' In all political meanings, the
Government and the people are disconnected and
divided. The Government is to be guarded and
limited, but is that tiue of the people' Aie not
the office holdeis pait and parcel of the Govern-
ment of the United States, and, in guaiding
ugainst them, do you not guaid against the Gov
ernment' These ofiiceis embiaccd by the bill
hold then office at the will of the Executive, and
are they not a poition of the Government' The
Government consists of thiee departments, one
of winch is the executive, and aie they not ex-
ecutive ollkcis' They, therefore, in a most ím-
poitant sense, are a pan of the Government, and
on this, from its very nature, you impose icstnc-
Uons
It has been repeated, till the woida aie almost
disgusting, that Executive power has incieased,
is niueasitig, and ought to be diminished And
are these officers not pait and paicel of the Ex-
ecutive- Gentlemen talk about putting fetters on
the people, but on whose hands do we propose
to put fetteis' It is on the Buarean hands of
power, winch the President has cm phaticallypio-
claimed to be his own hands, and in their official
functions and tenuie, as I said before, they aie
pait and parcel of the Executive—the meie min-
isters of ins will, and here, [on Mr P.'s desk,]
in a somewhat unwieldy shape, aie papers fiom
the celebiated Piesident Jackson, in which he
maintains the doctiino that they aie to repoit
every part of their doings to the Executive, that
they aie but an emanation fiom his center light,
exeieising ins functions, and that he is Piesident
in and over them all, and, annihilating time and
space, he, in cftect, is everywhere, and at eveiy
time present That is his language when he was
Piesident But I will not tiouble the Si nateany
further,lor they knowhisdoctmies on this point
This, then, is a portion of the Evcrutive, thiough
whom we propose to icstnct the Piesident him-
self, when acting in this way
Well, sir, will the gentleman go on to tin mon   !
stroua conclusion that in foiling fetteis for the |
Executive we aie forging fetters  for ouiseKos'i
That we aie not only not to be jealous of him, i
but that he is amalgamated with ouiselves' At d |
will he believe that when we put fetteis on the .
Executive, we in fact put them on the hands of
the people ' Sir, I know full well how much moie I
easil) a delusion of this kind may anse in our
Government than  m  the British or any  other
monarchical Government, and it is tiue that theie
is danger of aa impeiceptibleincieasing of Exec-
utive power unknown  to us fiom this cucum
stance, that the Executive is but an emanation
fiom the people,he is the individual, for the time
being, whom  the people delight to honor, and
thus, when fetteis aie imposed on tne Executive,
he and hi  supporter can all the more íeadily
peisuade us that they art imposed on the people
themselves     General Jackson took the giound
boldly that he was ihepeople, the very imperson-
ation of the Demoeiacy, that he repiesented the
JJemociacy, and he argued that all the powers of
the people were in las own person, that he was
to be looked to as a Bound impersonation of the
people,providirtgandeontrollmgeverythmg. Ay,
sir, and he did, he trampled down everything that
came in his way, even to the Capitol itself, at one
fearful blow he crushed us, and the record of our
shame is to be found in the proclamation and law
in regard to South Carolina The legitimate ef-
fects of his doctrine on this point were felt every-
where, and it was felt because General Jackson
was regarded as the impersonation of the Democ-
lacy of the whole country And he was so, and,
in consequence, the Government was turned top-
sy-turvy. But this was not our Government,
this was not a republican Government with dis-
tinct and different departments Sir, the very
object of your occupying that chau is to watch
the Executive. And are gentlemen to tell us that
to forge manacles for that power is to forge them
for the people' De Tocqueville speaks of the
danger of our Executive power as comparatively
imminent and alarming, foi in the contest between
the ciown and the people, at every doubtful or
suspicious movement of the Executive, many aie
alarmed foi their lights, and use up at once, but
in this countiy, where the people feel that the
Piesident is an emanation fiom themselves, they
aie liable to argue that when he augments his own
powei, it is foi the people, and thus every Exec-
utive may go on in the acquisition of the pioper
power of the Legislature and the Judiciary And
we have all been mutually wuging war against
each othei as diffeient branches of the Govern-
ment, but none for the people, yet it was a wat
of one branch against anothei. And we ha\e, in
fact, pumiued the power of one man to lule the
countiy, and now we have a proposition, staled,
as fru as the approbation of this Senate is con-
ct ined, that Executive office holders are the peo
pie Sn, it does not require to go one inch further
to jpiove that the President is the people
Befoie I pioceed to answei another branch of
the subject, I wish to advert to two alleged and
puncipal facts which seive as the foundation of
this repoit, and I will show that no such facts
exist On page 3 of the report, it is stated as a
fact, and an inceptive pnnciple on which the com-
mittee rested, that the State governments have
made no discrimination between the mass of their
citizens and the office holders of the General Gov
eminent Now, su, the fact is exactly the op-
posite, for such is the habitual jealousy of the
States, and their watchfulness of your power,
that, I believe, in eveiy State there is a funda-
mental law foibidding the officers of the United
States Government fiom holding any office of
piofit or tmst in the gift of the State The very
fact of holding office under tins Government is
legaided asa disfianchisement in all the States
of the Union But 1 beg leave to quote the lan-
guage of the report
" Happily our institutions, resting upon the just founda
tion oí populai lights in Hhf r demand nor will idmil ot the
niutilanon oí tin peison or lile puvileges of citutn-hip is
a picieqmsite for office Under the existing 1 uvs, a citizen
ot a st ue does not bv accepting any ot tho offices (<1( sig
nated in the lull) under the I ederal GoveinnK nt, forfeit
my ot Ule njils and pnvilegcs which belong to him as a
citizen ot a btatc "
Foi felts no right' Sn , he is disfranchised if
he holds office undei this Government And what
is the fact in legaid to the soldiery of the United
States' And on what pnnciple can you disfian
chise a soldiet any moie than an office-holder, if
these lights aie inheientin him as i citizen ' Un
questionably you have in that case no such i ight
Yet a United States soldiei does not vote, and
gentlemen fiom all parts of the House, una x,oce,
have declaied that the office holders aie the en-
listed soldieis of the Executive, thus identified
as the veiy peisons who aie disfranchised And
yet these peisons who are thus cbaiactenzed as
enlisted soldieis, it is now declined aie not to be
disfranchised, while the whole Army proper, of
eij-lit oi ten thousand, aie so in fact
Mr Piesident, the íepoit proceeds to make
another assertion winch is altogether at variance
with fact, and which is the tatal ¡>ouice of all the
evil pnnciples which flow out of it, and to that
I beg tho attention of the Senate It is the al-
leged fact that office holders aie appointed by the
people, that they arc emanations fiom the people,
and the agents of the people. But is that the
fa"t'   No, sn , they hold their offiee in spite of
the people, by Executive power, and for Execu-
tive purposes.
Mr. CLAY, of Kentucky. And often against
their wishes.
Mr. PRESTON. Notoriously so. The peo-
ple are flouted, and their opposition is a reason
why these men are appointed and retained in
office Sir, look at my own State, where four
fifths of its citizens aie on the other side What
is the case in respect to office-holders with us'
The very fact that the people wished certain of-
fice-holders- appointed was the very íeason why
they were not appointed They were appointed
against us, and over us, to control us in spite of
ourselves
Another alleged fact in the report is, that the
committee have not known this power to be
brought in conflict with the elections Let us
recapitulate a little In 1821 or 1822, by a dis-
tinguished Governor of a State, it was solemnly
declared to be a fact De Witt Clinton presented
it solemnly as an existing evil which required
correction.under the administration of Mr. Adams;
and it was proclaimed and blazoned forth in every
corner ot tíje country, that the office holders had
interfered with the freedom of elections,and Gen-
eral Jackson received a toi rent of applause in the
expectation that he would crush this mass of
evil, which put the country in a foam,and raved
round the land; and yet the gentleman never
heard of it' Mr Jefferson and General Jack-
son came in under the same conditions, denounc-
ing this as an existing evil, and promising to cor-
lectit And now, as I have adduced the testi-
mony of Jefferson, Jackson, and Clinton, what
is the testimony of this report' It contradicts
and denies the truth of their testimony. Even
if it were admitted to be in its nature a grievance,
the repoit and the committee deny the fact, and
they also íepudiate the principle; and gentlemen
have sent abioad ten thousand copies of a report
which says that they give Mr Jefferson the he,
and further, it declaies them guilty of the enor-
mous cume of giving General Jackson the he,
declaring that all which both these gentlemen as-
sei ted on this point, is a lie Mr President, this
is a very intrepid report It boldly marches up
to the face of Mr Jefferson, and denounces him
at the very moment when it professes to giound
its doctrines on his principles. Mr. Jefferson
said this was an evil, the report says it is none,
he says it existed, the repoit denies it, he said he
would conect it, the report says that it is uncon-
stitutional and tyrannical And this is not all,
but, bolder than this, though it might be sup-
posed that the bones of Jefferson weie not to be
desecrated or passed by with nreverence, the re-
port goes higher and further than this, it de-
nounces Jackson, and gives him the he in rela-
tion to a matter of fact It dares a conflict with
the power of his opinion
And with what face can gentlemen tell me that
the combined powei of this Government cannot
suppress a grievance which is acknowledged to
exist' What did Mi Jefferson propose to do by
his individual power' He pledged himself to
suppiess. this evil befoie he entered upon his office,
and he did suppiess it.
1 will not lead the report of the Senator from
Missouri [Mi Bentov] but refei to a passage or
two, and see how it squares with this report, in
which honoiable gentlemen say, in regard to these
ofhceis, that the people are delighted to trust them,
in blind confidence, with all their lights and func-
tions And what said theSenalor fiom Missouri,
when, in a different position fiom his present one,
he was a leader in the Opposition'
