commissariat has been a meager one, unavoidable so because of the distance from a base, the patients have done well, and a large number are now on duty, who, under other circumstances, would now be carried on the rolls of some rear hospital. The following consolidated summary of the three divisions from July 22 to September 30, inclusive, will, I think, demonstrate the advantage of retaining the sick and wounded with the command when the operation of the troops permit it:

Admitted:

Sick.........................................................2,935

Wounded...................................................... 480

-----

Total........................................................3,415

--------

Returned to duty.............................................1,010

Transferred to other hospitals...............................1,419

Discharged................................................... 4

Died......................................................... 173

Furloughed................................................... 1

Deserted..................................................... 2

------

Remaining:

Sick......................................................... 755

Wounded...................................................... 51

The patients transferred to the other hospitals were Confederates and members of other corps who were admitted to our hospitals after the main army had gone to the right, and after our occupancy of the city. One hundred and seventy-three deaths are reported, of which number more than 60 were mortal wounds.

The following casualties have occurred among the medical officers of the command since the commencement of the campaign: Asst. Surg. Taylor Elmore, One hundred and thirty-seventh New York Volunteers, died May 27, 1864; Surg. H. S. potter, One hundred and fifth Illinois Volunteers, killed June 2, 1864; Surg. William H. Heath, Second Massachusetts Volunteers, died August 28, 1864.

I regret my inability to furnish consolidated reports of wounds and operations from the commencement of the campaign, but the data furnished by my predecessor is so wanting in detail as to render it valueless for statistical purposes.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN W. FOYE,

Surg., U. S. Vols., Med. Director, Twentieth Army Corps.

Medical Director, Department of the Cumberland.
