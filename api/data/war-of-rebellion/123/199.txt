By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

The Governor desires to issue his proclamation to-day. Please notify him at Albany if you approve or disapprove of this assurance, and me at Parker House, Boston.

General BUCKINGHAM,

Parker House, Boston:

Your arrangement in respect to recruiting is approved. The Department will sanction and confirm whatever arrangement you deem expedient for the service.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

BOSTON, July 2, 1862-11 a.m.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I cordially respond to the President's call for troops. The bounty of $25 should be paid as fast a company (not a regiment) is mustered in. Then the first ten companies be massed into a regiment,and so on. No effort ever has been,nor ever will be, spared to meet or anticipate any wish expressed by your Department.

Always, faithfully,

JOHN A. ANDREW.

ALBANY, N. Y., July 2, 1862.

The PRESIDENT:

Is the call for 300,000 or for 200,000 volunteers? It appears in all the New York papers for 300,000.

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York.
