HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 30, 1864-7.40 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding desires to know whether you still hold the crater, and, if so, whether you will be able to withdraw your troops from it safely to-night, and also to bring off the wounded. The commanding general wishes to know how many wounded are probably lying there. It will be recollected that on a former occasion General Beauregard declined to enter into any arrangements for the succor of the wounded and the burial of the dead lying under both fires, hence the necessity of immediate and active efforts for their removal in the present case.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to call your attention to the fact that you have made no report to him upon the condition of affairs in your front since he left your headquarters yesterday, and that you have made no reply to the two special communications upon the subject sent you last night at 7.40 and at 10.40. I am also directed to inquire as to the cause of the omissions.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Your dispatch was received just as I was making out a report of our casualties. I have used every means to get something like accurate reports, but it has been difficult. The rumors are very numerous and
