SIR: I have the honor to report that on the 20th December I accredited Captain H. R. Selden, of the Fifth Infantry, as bearer of a flag of truce to the commanding officer of the Confederate forces in the Mesilla to negotiate an exchange of prisoners of war, proposing to exchange Lieutenant William Simmons, of the Confederate Army, for Lieutenant Pedro Losalla, of the Second New Mexican Volunteers, and Private James Wilson, captured with Lieutenant Simmons, for the release of the parole of Private William Leamy, of Company I, Mounted Riflemen. As Lieutenant Losalla had denied his official connection with the New Mexican volunteers, joined the Texans and declined to be exchanged Lieutenant Medina, captured by the Texans with Captain Minks, was sent to me in the place of Lieutenant Losalla and the parole of Private Leamy canceled.

Inclosed herewith are copies of the correspondence.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. S. ROBERTS,

Colonel of Volunteers, Commanding.

They are of the same rank, Lieutenant Pedro Losalla being a second lieutenant of a regularly constituted company of New Mexican volunteers in the service of the United States servng under my orders. After the surrender of Major Lynder to your forces on July 27, 1861, a private of Company I of the Mounted Riflemen was paroled by you, and I propose his exchange for Private James Wilson, captured with Lieutenant Simmons and now held by me. If you send by Captain Selden Lieutenant Pedro Losalla and the release of Private William Leamy, of Company I, Mounted Riflemen, from his parole and such escort as you deem sufficient for the safe return of
