HEADQUARTERS ARMIES CONFEDERATE STATES,Richmond, June 7, 1864.

His Excellency Governor WILLIAM SMITH,

Richmond:

SIR: Your communication of yesterday's date was referred, as I then had the honor to inform you, to His Excellency the President, who decides that it is not designed to keep reserves or local-defense men in the field beyond the necessity to meet which they are called out.

Up to this time our loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners does not exceed 18,000, while that of the enemy in similar respects is not less than 70,000. But both armies have been built up through re-enforcements to their original standard, and other battles have still to be fought equally bloody with the bloodiest.
