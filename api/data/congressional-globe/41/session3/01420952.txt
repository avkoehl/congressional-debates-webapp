THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 4,
stated to me that that conclusion had been
communicated to the Governor. Probably in
a few days a certificate will be furnished to
09e or other of these claimants, and if the
resolution is adopted there should be a pro-
viso added to the effect that nothing con-
tained in the resolution should prevent either
party from being sworn on regular credentials
as Representative of the district in question.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from
Wisconsin can move to amend the resolution
in that way. Bnt nothing in the resolution
could prevent what the gentleman wishes to
guard if a majority of the House so ordered it.
Mr. YOUNG. I desire to say that the time
which the Governor had to issue a certificate
has expired. He was required to issue the
certificate within thirty days. I have here the
law to that effect, which I shall have read at
the Clerk's desk if any gentleman desires it.
Mr. PAINE, of Wisconsin. I move to amend
the resolution by adding the following words:
Provided, That nothing herein contained shall
prevent either party from being sworn at any time
upon regular credentials a3 Representative of said
district.  
I desire to say just a word. \Ve have already
established a precedent in a case from Geor-
gia that we must admit the man who presents
the Governor's certificate, notwithstanding
that opposition is made. Now, I do not know
that this seat should be given to either claim-
ant in this case, nor do I know to which
claimant it should be given; bnt I do know
that if regular credentials should be furnished
by the Governor to either claimant it would
be our duty to allow him to take the oath of
office under his credentials. I want to so act
that that course shall be left open.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. There is nothing
inconsistent with that in the resolution offered
by the gentleman from Georgia, [Mr. Yooxg.]
Mr. YOUNG. Idonotobjecttotheamend-
ment of the gentleman from Wisconsin; but I
wish to say that this matter has been put off
day after day for abont a month, and now we
want to set the ball rolling. We are not afraid
of an investigation fay the committee, but we
want something to be done. No certificate
has been issued to anybody, and I have good
reason to believe that the Governor 01 the
State does not mean to issue any certificate.
Mr. PAINE, of Wisconsin. I am entirely
satisfied that the resolution shall pass with the
amendment I have offered.
Mr. YOUNG. I accept the amendment of
the gentleman from Wisconsin.
The resolution, as modified, was agreed to.

lain of the House of Representatives.
The Journal of yesterday's proceedings was
read and approved.
soldiers op t1ie war of 1812.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Before the Sec-
retary transmits to the House of Represent-
atives the amendments made by the Senate
yesterday afternoon to the bill (H. R. No.
1829) granting pensions to certain soldiers and
sailors of the war of 1812, and the widows of
deceased soldiers, the Chair desires to direct
the attention of the Senate to a discrepancy
in two amendments. In Committee of the
Whole an Amendment was agreed to, on the
motion pf the Senator from South Carolina,
[Mr. Sawter,] to insert after the word "dis-
charged," in the ninth line of the firstsection,
the following words:
And to suefa other officers aud soldiers may
have been personally named in any resolution of
Congress for any speeifie service in said war, although
their term of service may have been less than three
consecutive months.
But after the bill was reported to the Senate
the words ''three consecutive months" were
stricken oat of the bill and " sixty days" in-
serted. There is, therefore, this discrepancy.
If there be no objection, the Secretary will
be directed to correct the discrepancy, so that
this amendment shall correspond with the
other section's of the bill and read "sixty
days," Is there objection? The Chair bears
none; and, by unanimous consent, the amend-
ment will be made.
