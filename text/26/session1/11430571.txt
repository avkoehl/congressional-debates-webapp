435519,109 each year; thus proving, that in addi-
tion to the national debt incurred by the Govers-
B;nt during he war, the country in five years
alter had iticuned a debt ol auout one hundred
and eighty null on« for foreign merchandise.
I exhibit, Mr. Chairman, tables showing the
amount ot the «ales ot" tha public lands annually,
from 1815to 1824 inclusive; and also a table show-
ing the amount of experts and imports, and the
excess of imports over exports, from 1815 to
1819, inclusive.

The tables I have exhibited show that as soon
as the country began to feel ihe stimulus of the
canses which induce overaction, the effects were
visible in the rapid increase of the sales of the
public lands, and the great excess of imports over
exports. It is proper, however, to remark, that,
during the war, the commerce of the country
was nearly destroyed; the exports for 1814 being
but |6,927,753, and the imports #12,965,000.
The removal of the restraints of a belligerant
condition permitted the spirit of enterprise to roam
unfettered: and having long been pent up, it ran
into not and excess in the first years ot its re-
newed freedom.
A striking parallel to this period of our his-
tory, may be found in that^ieriod, dating at 1833,
and including the intermediate years to 1838,which
I shall endeavoi to exhibit. Then, Mr. Chairman,
followed the revulsion of 1819, the causes of
which were, 1st, a sudden and unparallelled con-
traction of the currency. The circulation, which
was #110,000,000 in 1816, was reduced to #45,-
000,000 in 1819, being nearly five-eighths of the
whole amount. This, sir, of itself, was a suffi-
cient cause for the tremendous fall m the prices
of all kinds of property which ensued, and the
startling and terrific pressure and distress which,
then swept over the country.
2.  A diminution of the demand in proportion to
the supply. The Government, from being the
great consumer of the produce of the country,
ceased comparatively to be a consumer. Its armies
were disbanded, and the soldier returned to the
fields of rural labor, and exerted the energies
he had devoted to the defence Of his country,
in the business of production.
3.  The cessation of high taxes, one of the ele-
ments of high prices, was another cause of the
reduction of prices. Superadded to these
causes was a depreciation of the currency, produced
by a suspension of specie payments by all the
banks south of New England, which also deranged,
as every suspension does, the exchanges of Ike
country.                                                                  •
The scenes, sir, which followed, are within the
recollection of all who lived at that period. The
mo^t astounding fall In the prices of real estate,
cattle, provisions, and properly of any kind, took
place. Thousands were otter! y and hopelessly
beggared and ruined; plunged, str, from affluence
to extreme poverty ir#* single day. A scene of
distress ahtt t>tferi«g ensued, wtch as this country
never before aor since witnessed.   I quote * few
passages from Mr. Crawford's excellent report,
which I have before referred to:
'In the latter part ol 1318, when the price of the principal
articles of American production had fallen nearly nfty per
cent in foreign markets; when the merchant needed the aid of
additional loans to sustain nun against the losses which ho had
incurred bv the «miden reduction in the price ol the commodi-
ties he had exported,he was called upon to discharge loans
previously contracted. The agriculturist, who sa* his income
reduced below his indispensable noceasmes; the manutactuter,
who was iot only struggling igairsl fort gn competition, but
who saw the sale of his minulactures i educed by the incapa-
city ot his customers to buv; in fact, all classes cf the commu-
nity, under cm umsiances so adveiseto ihe command ol funds,
were subiected to curtailments whnever they had obtained dis-
counts.
"All intelligent writers upon currency agree that where it is
decreasing in amount, poverty and miseiy must pievail    The
correctness of the opinion is too manifest to require proof The
united voice of the nation attests its accuracy.   As there is no
recorded example in the history of nations oía reduction of the
currency, -o rapid and so extensive, so but few examples have
oceurted of distress so general and so severe as that which has
been exhibited in the United States.   To the evils of a decreas-
ing currency are superadded those of a deficient currency.   But
notwithstanding it is deficient, it is still  depreciated    In seve
rat of the States the ereat mass ef the circulation is not even os-
tensibly convertible into specie at ihe will of the holder.   Dur-
ing the greater partoftha time that ha« elapsed since there-
sumption of specie payments, the convertibility of bank notes
into specie has been rather nominal than real in the largest por-
tion of the Union.   On the part of the banks, m tual weakness
had produced mutual forbearance.   The extensive diffusion of
bank stock among the great body of the citiaens in most of the
States, had produced the same forbearance among individuáis
To demand specie of the banks, when  it was known that they
were unable to pay, was to destroy their own interests, by de-
stroying the credit of the banks in which «he productive por-
tion of their property was invested.   In favor of forbearance,
was also added the influence of the great mass of bank debtors.
Every dollar in specie drawn out ot the banks  especially lor
exportation, induced the necessity of curtailment".   To this por-
tion of the community all other ev.ls wete light, when com-
pared with the imperious demands of banks    lt.ur exertions
to prevent the drain of spetie in the possession or tbo=e who
controlled their destiny, equalled the magnitude of the evils
which were to be avoided.
"As the currency is, at least m some parts ef the Union, do
predated, it must, in tho=e parts, suffer a further reduction be-
fore it becomes sound. The nation must continue to suffer un-
til this is effected After the cuirency shall be reduced to the
amount which, when the present quanti'y of the piecious me-
tals is distributed among the various nations of the world, in
proportion to their respective exchangeable values, shall be
assigned to the United States; when time shall have regulated
the price of labor, and of commodities, according to that
amount; and when pre-extstmg engagements shall have been
adjusted, ttiesuflferings from a depreciated, decreasing, and de-
ficient currency, will be terminated Individual and public
prosperity will sradually revive, and the productive energies
of the nation resume "their accustomed activity But Dew
changes in the currency, and circumstances adverse to the per-
petuity of the general prosperity, may icasonably be expected
to occur. So lar as these changes depend upo.i the currency,
their recurrence, to anextent sufficient to disturb the prosperi-
ty of the nation, would be effectually prevented, if it cou d be
rendered purely metallic. In that event, weshould always re-
tain that proportion of the precious metals wh ch- our exchange-
able commodities bear to those of other nations. Tne currency
would seldom be either redundant or deficient, to an extent that
would seriously affect the interests of society. But when the
currency is metallic, and paper convertible into specie, changes
to such an extent, it is believed, will frequently occur."
Mr. Crawford attributed th^ vast and appalling
amount of suffering, to the contraction and derange-
ment of the currency. This, sir, is what he says
on this point:
'That the establishment of banks, in agricultuial districts,
has greatly improved the general appearance of the country, is
not denied. Comfortable mansions and spacious bar* s have
been erected; lands have been cleared and reduced to cultiva-
tion; farms have been stocked, and rendered more productive,
by the aid of bank credits But these improvement* will even-
tually be found, m most cases, to effect the rum of the proprie-
tor, the farm, with us improvements, will frequently piove
unequal to the discharge of the debts incurred in its embellish
ment. Such, in fact, is the actual or apprehended state of
things wherever banks have been established in the small m-
land towns and villages. Poverty and distress are impending
over the heads of most of tho3e. who have attempted to improve
their farms by the aid of bank credits So general is this dis-
tress, that the principal attention of the Stale Legislatures,
where the evil exists, is, at this moment, duected to the adop
tion of measures calculated to .rescue then fellow-Citizens from
the inevitable effects of their own indiscretion If, in affording
a shield to the debtor, against the legal demand of his creditor,
the axe shall be applied to the root of the evil, by the annihila-
tion of banks where they ought never to have existed, the in-
terference, however doubtful in point of policy or principle,
mayeven'ually be productive of moiegondthan evil
"The general system of credit, which has bten introduced
through the asrency of banks, brought I o*ne to every m -n's
door, has produced a factitious state of things, cxtiemely ad-
verse in the sober, frugal, and industrious habits which ou^ht
to be cherished in a Republic. In the place of these virruí*,
extravagance, idleness, and the spirit of gambling adventure
have been engendered and fostered by our institutions.
'•The system, of credit, which, in the infancy of our com-
merce, was indispensable to its prosperity, it not to its exis-
tence, has been extended at a period when the dictates of sound
discretion seemed to require that it «hould be shortened. The
credit given upon the sale of the natioual domain has diffused
this spirit of speculation and of inordinate enterprise among
the great mass of oar citizen . The public lands are pur-
chased, and spleadid towns erected upon them, with bank
credits. Every thing is artificial. The rich inhabitant of the
commercial cities, and the tenant of the forests, differ only in
the object of tnefr pursuit.   Whether commerce, splendid rain-
sions, or public land , be the object of desire, the means by
which the giatitii.it,on is to be secured are bank credits.
4 This state of lui.c-is no less unlneidly to the duration of
our Renublnan institutions, than n 11 adverse to the develop
ment ol our na'ional energies, T\hen great emergencies shall
arise; for, upon such oct d-ions, the attention of the citizen will
be directed to th p seivmon of his prnpeity fiom the grasp
of lils c.e litor*, nis'ead of being devoted to t' e defence of his
country Instead o being able to pay with pinmptitude the
contriuutioiis uceo sary to the preservation of *he State, He will
be induced toclai i the interferenie of the Government to pro-
tect him against i íe afees of hi  folly and extravagance "
Such, Mr Chairman, were the phenomena ex-
hibited in that f >r'oa of our history, commencing in
1815, and ending; m 1819, the problem of which I
have attempted to -^oUe. How perfect is the re-
semblance between ihat period and the last two
years!
I shall now, sir, take ,i brief view of the parallel
of the period of our histe-y winch I have just been
c nsiderin£, which is to be 'ound in that period em-
bracing the years 1834 to 1839.
It will be been bv the tab't, of prices in the Bos-
ton markets, which I ba>/e already introduced,
that from 1819 to 1832, tu- pices of beef, pork,
flour, wool, and cottm, wtie comparatively low.
At that date they commenced rising untj most of
those articles attained the extraordinary prices of
1837 and 1838, the causes of which, I shall now
proceed to assign, and which will be found to be
ihe very same whieh led to the increase of
prices during the former period. They were —
1. An txpansion of the currency. This was com-
menced by the United States Batik, which bad then
embarked in its crusade against the Government to
force from it a re-ctíarter. It commenced the game
of expansion in 1832, after Gen. Jackson had
avowed his hostility to that institution. During the
first six months of that year, it increased its loans
from 51,43,000,000 to over $70.000 000. To verify
the predict] >n of its friends, that there would be
constant fluctuation and instability in the currency
and the ouune^s of the country, until a new bank
was thartere!, and to pave the way for the panic
which was to follow the removal of the deposites,
in August of 1833, it comtr.eaced its first system of
contraction, and, in less tlian one year, reducto" its
loans and discounts neany #17,000,000, and its
circulation about $3,000,000; at the same time in-
creasing the spec.e in its vaults about the same
amoun;, which vas abstracted from circulation,
and contributed its duo rroportion to the panic
which followed. 1' failed i" iis object. The depo-
sites were not leturned to ihat institution.
In 1834 the bank commenced its second grand
scheme of expansion, with the premeditated design
of coercing from the Government a new charter,
and which superinduced the revulsion and panic of
1837. On the 1st of September, 1834, the loans of
the United States Bank were $47,058,493; speeie,
$13,863,897; circulation, $10,298,577. On the l t
of June, 1335, a period of nine months only, it had
increased us loans to $68,642,646; its circulation to
$22 009,474; its specie remaining about the same
as in 1834. The small banks" followed the lead of
the mammoth institution. Onthe 1st of January,
1834, the whole number of banks in the United
States was 506; the aggregate amount of their loans,
$321,119 499; circulation, $94,833,580. Tney hi-
creased m number, amount of discounts, and circu-
lation, lo January 1,1837, when their number was
634; their loans and discounts $525,115,702; and
their circulation $149,185,840. Thus was ad-
ded, in the space cf three years, $200,996,203 to
the leans and discount.-., affecting individual'; and
$54,346,320 to the circulation, affecting Ihe cora-
munity generally; being an increase of the former
of r.rarly two-fifths, and of the biter, more than
one-ihirdj an-1 adding to the banking "aocommeda-
tions"- of the country, more than TWO HUN-
DRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLIONS, t will
here note ihe effects of this ^¡t  catj^e
wnich was su^iic ent of íHelf to accdOBfcffor the in-
flation of prrce^, ihe overtrading and general over-
acuon which ensued. The effects were immediately
visible m the excessive importations which were
made, and in the sales oTthe public lands. Refttw
1834 the excess of the imports over the exports was
not unreasonably great.
