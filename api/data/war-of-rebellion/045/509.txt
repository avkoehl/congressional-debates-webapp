HARRISBURG, PA., July 3, 1863. (Received 1. 45 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Have seen the telegram of General Meade to General Halleck. To-night or early to-morrow, General Smith moves from Carlisle, with force increased to 9, 000, toward Cashtown. General Wool continues to object to sending the two companies of artillery at Fort Hamilton. They would be very great service if here. Colonel Pierce's force, in Bedford County, of 2, 000, is on the march in the direction of Chambersburg, to harass the rear of the enemy. Captain Boyd pushed his small cavalry force to Fayetteville, and returned to Shippensburg with 42 prisoners. He and his command have done good service.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-general.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

General Smith telegraphs from Carlisle that Lee engaged Meade on the 1st at 11 a. m. Lee driven back 2 miles. Action continued on the 2nd until 9 a. m., when Lee, by flag of truce, asked to bury his dead. Firing ceased at that time.

The entire rebel baggage train, with stolen horses, at Cashtown; all the escort of it, even Daniel's brigade of raw troops, sent to the front.

This information from a contraband, recently belonging to General Olds, brought to Carlisle by a scout.

Dispatches from Captain Boyd, who is following the train the General Smith, corroborate what is said about the train. General Couch has ordered an advance up the Valley. Everything going on well here.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
