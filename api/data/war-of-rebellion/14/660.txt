GENERAL: The report* of Lieutenant-Colonel Young of the operations of his command at Haxall's Landing and Malvern Hill is received. I desire that you will express to Lieutenant-Colonel Young my sense of the courage and efficiency which marked the conduct of himself, his officers and men, and of the success which attended his efforts against a superior force of the enemy. Colonel Young has performed the duty assigned to him in a manner creditable to himself and his command.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant.

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: A letter from General McClellan informs me that our prisoners at Fort Warren to leave that place July 31 on the steamer Ocean Queen for James River; also that the prisoners from Fort Delaware were expected at Westover in a day or two. In firing on the enemy's fleet in the river caution will be necessary, so as not to inflict loss on the returning prisoners.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.

AUGUST 3, 1862

General S. G. FRENCH:

GENERAL: I think that one brigade would be sufficient below. The enemy has doubtless landed in force for permanent occupancy of the ground opposite his camp. We cannot drive him from there and can only check in from going too far into the country.

He may mean to advance upon this place, but I think not for some days; hence we need our strength employed on the fortifications. I would prefer, therefore, that one brigade be halted before it advance too far.

I am opposed to an engagement on an uncertainty in regard to the strength of our enemy.

Yours, truly,

D. H. HILL.

Major-General.
