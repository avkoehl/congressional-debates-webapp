MERIDIAN, December 31, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

I desire again to call your attention to my dispatch to the Secretary of War of the 28th, and to say that further information and reflection render it highly important for the efficiency and success of the administration of this department that the request contained in that dispatch should be granted. It is but the continuation of the arrangement with General Pillow under General Johnston, and as it sacrifices no principle, I earnestly request it may meet with your sanction and approval.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
