CUMBERLAND, January 6, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington:

The First Separate Brigade, General Averell, has been by my order named the Fourth Division of this department; this by reason of recent addition thereto, and to enable it to have an assistant commissary of musters. It has been found impracticable to muster properly and promptly veteran volunteers of the command, very many of whom are enlisting. To facilitate, I suggest the name of Captain Edwin Frey, Twenty-eighth Ohio, for assistant commissary of musters, Fourth Division.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 6, 1864-9 a. m.

Colonel MULLIGAN, New Creek:

Yours of last night just received. I had already ordered Sullivan and Averell to be on the alert and cut off Lee's return if possible. What was your information last night? Is the enemy at Romney or at Moorefield Junction, or on the Northwestern pike east of Romney? What is your information from Thoburn? Has the enemy all left his front? Please answer me fully. How long will it take you to get ready to move? Did the Fourth and Sixth arrive? If so, see that they are taken care of.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 6, 1864-9 p. m.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN, Harper's Ferry:

The troops (infantry) sent to Martinsburg will be under your command. I will be down to see you on this and other subjects as soon as possible. Thoburn reports the enemy all gone from his front. It is reported by scouts that Lee and Rosser passed through Blue's Gap yesterday afternoon. The railroad agent informs me to-night that 1,400 troops leave Harper's Ferry for the Ohio River. What troops are they?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
