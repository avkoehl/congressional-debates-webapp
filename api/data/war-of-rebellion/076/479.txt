HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 12, 1864-2 a.m.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to acknowledge receipt of your letter* of 11.30 p.m. [August 11], and to say, in reply, that General Cox's division will be substituted for your command, in the advance to-morrow.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,August 12, 1864-11.15 a.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Commanding Army of the Ohio:

Colonel Garrard reports to me that a dismounted force has been placed by the enemy in position across the Campbellton road, about half a mile west of here. Casement is feeling forward and to the right, and as soon as Reilly is in position I will have him support Garrard in a reconnaissance to the right to develop fully what there is on that flank. This has to be done, of course, before Casement can make much progress to the front, especially as he finds the detour to the right to avoid open country more considerable than we expected.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,August 12, 1864-11.40 a.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Commanding Army of the Ohio:

Lieutenant Reynolds, signal officer, reports rebels in line in upper part of open country in front of us, making earth-works, and others moving still farther toward our right, apparently extending the line. From the direction I should expect this to be seen from the point I left you in. Supposing you would wish to know this immediately I send the report, although so soon after my last dispatch. Nothing further from the right as yet.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,August 12, 1864-12.40 [p.] m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Commanding, &C.:

Casement is a mile west of where I left you, and has been obliged to keep on the north side of the Campbellton road all the way to avoid going into open ground. He then has to go around a large open field on the north side, which he is now doing, with some chance of finding cover to cross the road there. There is, however, so much open land
