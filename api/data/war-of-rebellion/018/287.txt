The relative proportion of each division in hospital was:

General Williams' division...................................61

General Shields' division...................................954

Total.....................................................1,015

During the two weeks following the number of the disabled was diminished by granting furloughs to some and discharges to others, and a large number were returned to their regiments via the Manassas Railroad in to two separate detachments; thus of General Shields' division there were:

Furloughed...................................................54

Discharged...................................................20

Returned to duty by hospital surgeon........................124

Returned to duty by provost-marshal..........................21

219

During the same time a number of men left hospital without

leave, and may be classed as deserters, about...............100

Total discharge from hospital grounds previous to May 25....319

During the fortnight between the 10th and 25th May there

were 50 deaths, and during the same period 34 new cases were

taken in from camps outside, leaving to be accounted for on

the morning of the 25th May as follows:

Of General Shields' command:

Received rations on that morning prior to being ordered to

leave hospital..............................................450

Removed in wagons to Winchester as being too sick to march...78

Left behind on grounds as too sick move, with the necessary attendants, but with hope removal in course of that day......65

593

The whole tabulated thus:

Received at Strasburg of General Shields' command...........954

Discharged...................................................20

Furloughed...................................................54

Returned to regiment........................................145

Died in hospital.............................................42

Removed in wagons............................................78

Left behind in hospital......................................65

Received rations and marched................................450

Deserted....................................................100

Total.......................................................954

These figures represent as near as possible the disposition of General Shields' men on the morning of the 25th May. Of the number who received rations and marched (450) any 180 are accounted for at this date; the rest may be classed as scattering.

I have the honor to be, yours, with respect,
