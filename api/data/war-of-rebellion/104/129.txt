SIR: I have the honor to inform you that I have just arrived with three schooner laden with an abundance of field artillery ammunition and small-arms, also with 30-pounder Parrotts and 20-pounder Parrotts. I am having them brought near the wharf to unload. Will you please give me orders?

Please send the 30-pounders forward at once. General Totten says there is no ammunition for the howitzers. They will therefore be retained for the present. Seventy-five wagons have been ordered to report to Captain Williamson to receive small-arms ammunition. Do not unload more than is actually called for.

By order, &c.:
