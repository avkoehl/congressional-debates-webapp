renc3 111 her favor, if thne be an), 01 impo-ts ai.d
exports, is more than made up by lie profit ,n 0or
favor on navigation. Will the i-hip cfi er- and na-
vigation interest go for ihib war of íeíaliation < n
France? Why thi? war on Fjance, cur ?ncicnt
ally and benef ictress—a nation wffith has 1  go^d
faith fettled with us and paid every claim either
upon her justice or her g^erosúy? Is it the o'd
war upon the 'red waii'coitls?"* How came ih-se
wines and sdks free? Was it our fati't, or thp fat.it
of art all-grasping protective parly, whose interest ¡t
'Mr Jefferson wore a red wais'coat, and was accused of being
a French politician,"
H. of Reps.
was to maUe all luxuries free, m order to raise all
the revenue from protecsdarticles? And now, since
Koumrrn commerie has found an cles of France
to exchange for Southern product, of coi on ana
obacco, ■qn'-e th; exchange of these for , Ks a-<d
wine  h?s becoorie f rcaiable to i< , aie we again 10
have a tax laid as directly upon our production as 1'
has he e'ofore been laid upon our co5tsu  piio)t?
That, Mr, wtll be the effect, i eutabJy, of a sax
upoi wi ,es ?"id silks—oí a war of countervail,ng
duties upon V anee. Separated as France is no v
from tcj Iloiy A.hance, weakened at.d threatened
as she has been ktely by the oih r gre^t European
Powers, 1 c ou'd sojner, sir, comm ace a war upon
any ciher bs'on than tmn her. &he nie's, e>,je-
cially at his tt-re, the coaaienanee of t'iat country
whto't owes its ¡ndip nderc and national exis ence
to her generou* ;id and ad a-.ce. So much for

the one does ¡lot follow the o'bri of conr ", n U by
?ny mean . A reduction of duty i> more frequent-

cause an increase of mpor aucrs. A medium
d,ity on imports is the beit duly ^1-rays to pirJuop

dcf. ct in the souices of reí eni.e, 01 from ea^stal ob-
structions to our res urces? Is ,t a pennane.it or a
re tpo'n>t/ deficiency? The genibman from Mame
(Mr, Evaks) asked what a permanent deficiency
is? Sir, it is capable oí definition and easily dis-
tinguishable from a temporary deficiency, and upon
this disiiectton the application of (he compromise
act in a measure depend . A permanent deficien-
cy is one which must cont.nue from defects in the
rtvenue laws, and m the source! of revenus; as
wi tre a duty is laid so high that imports are pro-
hibited and cannot come m, or where duties are so
low as to produce no customs though millions of
imports are entered, or where lands are sold in
sue. a way by law as to b.m  no spnce. But a
temporary deficiency is one which can continue no
longer han obstructions to the operation of laws
ar<3 re-noved; as where thet-iuties are all laid exact-
ly prop >rtioned to produce revenus, but extrinsic
causes prevent or interrupt trade and diminish im-
poriati in , where the duty is high enough and not
too high, but no imports are entered on which to
rtcetvedut.es owing to temporary obstructions of
eommerre. And this latter ca«e is precisely our
ens". We ha^e rot haretofoie—no Whigs have
here*orore—nerr b fore the election, complained of
r1 y iief c in the law,; but we have loudly complain-
eS ¿ml \, i'.i triurrinhint effect of the war of the
Ad nio.«.triitinn on ihe currency, on credit at home

debt : of the expeumen's of this Administration,
easing t/cestive speculations, a large foreign
í'í t eura 'a¿Mife at home, immense importations
ira few yea:-, and per'ectnon-imporrations nowr.
T'i • ll. c'L,it ons of trade have been immense, and
of cum 1,7 mor  e"ormt us still. The foreign
d<b two years ago was 2!)0 million^, and it c?n
bard'y have b°m leduced 25 miil.ons, it reduced
a' a,I Mure Tne^e and extravagance, and defal-
c 11 n, and political <rl ctioneermg in ihe (ffices of

il.e 'aiiu lav*., are no more ihe cau-e^ of this defi-
cency ilian anya'.'-.ci defecs in the laws orga-
niziig ineTii.asury Department were ihe causes of
tlV de'a'ctnon of S Ssva'twou ! Heretofore the
Admin -.tra'ion has been charging every cvü and
lo^s an I error lo ihe defects ot law*-; and we have
bi.en defeid ru, ihe laws and charg.ng every thing
to hen fa.11 ^ss and corrupt and negligent execu-
tion of me law t. And, sir, believing all I said be-
fóte the elecon, Í believe all Í «ay now, and will
not ching" my  tune wiih  mv change  of fortune.
0  it pf pow r .1 d in po*er, I declare that it 1?
offline; tj ro def-'ct tn iha 'a-iff lavvs that we have
n t retti up ent ugh to piy every dert we owe and
tot,nea lírg^ suitlus, b^>.idps. In 1839 the im-
portations were Cípossive and enormous—the fc-
rcign debt was incieased si much and the country
s i ov rs otAeJ witn goods t iat la-t vear the ímpor-
ta'K- s had to fall enormously, much of the foreign
debt was paid, the country is now bare, the de-
mand f r go ds i<- great and gronrg, large orders
aie .-ent out for goods to supply t-ie demand, many
goidwre sh'ppei to us by fmcigo merchants on
iheir own aevunt, thp ímsortati^ns must increase
aaain, and, wi h tie rest, ration if confidence, and
t-ade and credit and cj.renev, ¡he revenue must be

thp duties of course were to be diminished, and if
