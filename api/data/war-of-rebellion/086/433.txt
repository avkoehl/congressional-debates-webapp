Captain W. T. KITTREDGE:

The detachment I left on Parker's Creek last night was fired on this morning by 100 rebels at Osage Ford. Lieutenant Keeling and Captain Turner were close on them. Two hundred and fifty rebels crossed the road this side of Niangua to-day. I have not got over fifty serviceable horses now at the post.

Captain W. T. KITTREDGE:

The command I left on Parker's Creek fought the rebels this morning on Elk Creek, in Wright County, and got whipped, losing 2 killed and 16 prisoners. I would suggest that no troops be ordered from here, as the rebs are crossing at the rate of 200 per day between here and Niangua.

Price's forces attacked and shelled this place, but retreated at the approach of my command. Colonel Harrison reports his loss as trifling. Colonel Harrison will join me in pursuit, as you direct. The enemy lost several, including one officer. The enemy had divided, but seems to aim at a crossing of the Arkansas above Fort Smith.
