I have left a picket of a sergeant and 10 men at McKinney's Ford and one of the same size at Nance's Ferry, and will leave a picket of the same size here. I am moving the whole command to Massingill's Mill, 8 miles above here; from that point I will observe the other road at Rutledge. I inclose report of deserters who came in at Blain's Cross-Roads and whom I send to your headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Army of the Ohio;

Three deserters from the enemy came into our lines last evening, 1 lieutenant from the Second Kentucky Cavalry, of General John H. Morgan's brigade, now organizing at Decatur, Ala., 2 privates of Forty-seventh Alabama, Law's brigade, of Buckner's division (formerly Hood's division).

The lieutenant has no information from the enemy, having left his command several days before the retreat. The two privates left the enemy at New Market Tuesday morning. They report Longstreet's command ordered to march with five days' cooked rations, but were not able to get them and started with two days' bread rations and one of meat. All who were not able to march 20 miles a day were placed on the cars and shipped.

The current report among rebel officers and soldiers is that they were abandoning East Tennessee.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. 2nd DIV., CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE OHIO,Massingill's Mill, 6 Miles from Rutledge, February 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General POTTER

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The enemy's pickets left Dyer's Ferry and Ford about 12 o'clock (noon) yesterday. Camp-fires were seen last night in the vicinity of Mossy Creek, probably the fires of the cavalry rear guard.

I can hear of no rebel force on this side of the Holston, either at Rutledge or Bean's Station. I have now gone as far as I was ordered. I have found plenty of forage, and will rest here and feed my horses and await orders as to the direction in which I am to move.

In the morning I will have a report from scout sent to Rutledge and during the day will scout to Bean's Station, unless orders are received requiring me to move in a different direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding Division.
