HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Tullahoma, July 2, 1863 - 3.20 p. m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: A dispatch is just received from General Sheridan, dated 12.30 p. m. He found that the enemy had destroyed the railroad bridge across the Elk, and had crossed 1 1/2 miles above the ford, on the Winchester road. His mounted infantry had crossed the river, and were skirmishing with the enemy on the other side. General Davis' division is closed up behind Sheridan. Sheridan thinks he can cross with his infantry. Have you heard from General Stanley? We have had no intelligence from him since yesterday.

The general commanding desires to know whether you think it probable any part of the enemy's force will retreat across the mountains, in the direction of Pelham. General Wood's division is posted at Hillsborough. Has General Palmer come up with you? The telegraph line is now working between this place and Murfreesborough.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Jones' Ford, July 2, 1863 - 7.45 p. m.

Major-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to state, in reply to your letter of 3.20 p. m., that I forwarded all the information I had received of General Palmer's or Crittenden's corps, at 1.30 p. m. I have no information of General Stanley's whereabouts. I think it more than likely that some portion of the enemy will cross the mountains by way of Pelham. Is there any news from Vicksburg or Pennsylvania?

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Tullahoma, July 2, 1863.

General Morton will be at Elk River to-night, and is ordered to communicate with you, and render you any assistance in crossing that you may need. Give him orders directly, and inform us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
