Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout.

and as the inducements to enter the army are
much greater than hetetofore, and the bar to ad-
mission into the service without merit is, through
the action of the medical boards, complete, we
may reasonably caieu'ate on introducing mto the
army  m each succeeding year, a portion of the
veiy elite of the profession
It becomes my duty now to state to you, that
the clerical duties appertaining to the Surgeon
General's office cannot be performed by one indi-
vidual W hen th e office was first created, and one
clerk awarded to it, we had a small army, with the
ttoops more concentrated than now, a few medical
officers, and a still less number of hired physicians
Now, our army is larger, and the troops are much
raore dispersed over the country, a gi eat accession
has been made to the strength of the medical staif,
and from the necessities oí the service, growing
out of the state of war, a still greater increase of
hired physicians-is required Thecorrespondence,
simply, ot the Department with those numeious
physicians, and with the officers of the line of the
army, not to mention that on public business with
many persons in civil h*e, will give ample employ-
ment to the force now in the office And if we
take into consideration the various reports re
quired from the office, and also the numerous
returns, reports, &c , fiom the surgeons, assistant
surgeons, and other physicians employed at the
mihtaiy posts, arsenaU, recruiting rendezvous,
&e , extended all over the land, which have to be
examined and prepared for furthei action, and
supeiadd to these duties the laboi of scrutinizing,
adjusting, and finally settling the multiplicity of
complex and perplex accounts which are con-
stantly coming in upon the department, it will be
evident that, with the present force the business
of the office cannot be well done, if it is done at
all. 1 am willing, and so is the clerk, to do all
•bat other men can do I am ready to undeitake
whatever man can accomplish, but I cannot pei-
form impracticabilities, and one of these is, to keep
pace, with one clerk, with the continuously in-
creasing business, of the Medical Depaitment of
the Army

Sir: I consider it the duty of this Department
to present foi youi consideration a special repoit
upon the lecemly discovered default of Samuel
Swartwout, who had been collector of the customs
at the port of New York
The firstobject v. ill be to exhibit all the import-
ant facts connected with the case, so far as tncy
have been ascertained, then to explain the means
ior detecting such defaults which are provided by
the present laws, and, before closing, I shall take
the liberty respectfully to offer some suggestions
concerning the new legislation which ¡seems to be
required foi the public security against similar
defalcations
1st Mr Swartwout was originally appointed
collector on the 25Ji of April, 1829, during the
recess of Congress On the 29th day of March,
1830, he was reappointed for four years, by a
nomination to the Senate, which was confirmed
About the time his term expired, in 1834, he
was appointed again for a like term, which ended
on the 29th of March, 1838 and he was not re-
nominated, and has not since been in office.
Whilst Mr Swartwout remained collector sus-
picions do not seem to have been excited at the
Department that he was guilty of any default,
unless it may be that the balance of money m his
hands, when he was renominated to the Senate in
1834, appeared to be too large, and caused some
inquiry in relation to the subject
At that time, not having been myself connected
with this Department, and the present accounting
officers of the customs also, viz the First Comp-
troller and the First Auditor, not having been in
office, 1 am unable to state with accuracy what
then occurred, or what examinations were then
made, but it is represented that Mr Swartwout
and one of his clerks came to this city on that oc-
casion, and submitted explanations to a committee
of the Senate, which obviated any objections to
hifa leappomtment.
During his continuance in office, the statements
of his accounts, in a condensed form, ueie made
weekly to this Department, with punctuality, and
usually exhibited a balance in his hands, ranging
from a mere nominal sum, or nothing, to one hun-
dred thousand dollars The balance varied ac-
cording to the season of the year, and the circum-
stances, which might require laige drawbacks to
be paid, quaiterly settlements to be closed with
his suboi imates, or a great amount of duties íe-
ceived under protest to be refunded The e
elums have always been considered as constitut
mg an adequate reason for retaining on hand a
sufficient amount to discharge them promptly
The amount so required at the port of New Yoilr
is generally veiy heavy, being, on an average,
each quarter, over a thud of a mi'hon of dollars
The Inst return made beforeheleft office exhibited
^122,977 on hand, which was near $30,000 less
than the amount of hii> official bond X he return
eenu aftei hi  going out of office, which included
only the last thiee days of his teim, showed
§'ül 09G of money in h.s possession When
these leturns were received at the Department, it
was supposed that, the peuod of his service
having expned,he would have but asmall balance
of custom house expenses to defiay, no more de-
bentures to pay, and no gieat amount of duties to
refund, and he was forthwith requested by me to
deposit to the credit of the Tieasuier at least half
of the sum represented to be on hand
in reply, he claimed that certain cubtom-house
expenses remained to be discharged, and that suits
had been instituted against him foi return duties,
which, with numerous protests that had been filed
against payments, would be sufficient in amount
united with those expenses, to cover ti e whole
balance He therefoie insisted, as a right, on
being allowed to íetain money sufficient to satisfy
those liabilities unti1 the questions in controversy
received a judicial decision, and he professed to
iegaid that balance as not too large for the pur-
pose
Copies of the correspondence which took place
on the subject between him and the Department
are annexed
A fimher inquiiyinto the case was, however,
immediately instituted by rae, through the First
Comptrollei and the Solicitor of the Treasury It
terminated in an impression that the facts and the
law, as to s ii s and protests, might justify ashort
delay in the adjustment.
But the Comptioiler was, notwithstanding, di-
rected to bung Mr Swartwout's accounts to an
early settlement, and to have a prompt payment
made of whatever amount should appear to be not
in douot or controversy
Subsequent disclosures made to the Department
in November, excited suspicions not only as to
that balance, but a much larger indebtedness, and
measures were thereupon taken to have the whole
subject thoroughly investigated by the law officer
of the Department and the Comptroller, calling to
their aid, in the absence of Mr Swartwout abroad,
and under his neglect to offer voucheis for a final
settlement, all the lights and assistance which
could be obtained, not only here but at New York,
and from the books and papers of the collector's
office, as well as from those persons who had been
associated with him in it, and from his successor
The circumstances which led to most of those
disclosures transpired in the couise of preparing
the first quarterly accounts of that successor for
settlement, and the Department was first indebted
for them, in a great measure, to his care and vig-
ilance
After full investigation, the particulars of Mr
Swartwout's defalcation were ascertained, and a
report of the soi'e of his accounts was made by
the Comptroller to the Solictor of the Treasury,
and pioper legal proceedings instituted to collect
the balance appearing to be due The amount of
it as computed on the best data obtainable, was
$1,374,119 The legal proceedings were com-
menced against the principal on the account, and
against both the principal and sureties on the last
bond, the parties to which are also parties to the
formei one ior the poition of the outstanding
defalcation which an rued during the period em-
braced by the fust bond, but which is compara-
tively small, another fcuit will be brougnt as soon
as thp proper aer Hints can be adjusted Each
bond is for $150,000 Thesum of po.OOO in money
has been paid by his agents since the discovery of
the default, and large amounts of property have
been taken by the marshal, and likewise mort-
gaged, as collateral security How much this
balance will be reduced by vouchers hereafter
presented and allowed, and how far any final in-
debtedness may be considered secure, it is now
difficult, and indeed impossible, to compute with
any great degree ot accuracy
So far, however, as the facts could be ascer-
tained by the Solicitor and the accounting officers,
it is feaied that the whole amount of the defalca-
tion will not prove to have been less than a mil-
lion and a quarter of dollars The security of
different kinds which has been obtained is esti-
mated very highly by Mr Swartwout and some
otheis, so as to be consideied by them, with his
additional estate in other countries, an ample in-
demnity against any eventual loss by the Govern-
ment But they cannot be regarded by the Depart-
ment, with the limited information possessed at
this time concerning their situation, as equal in
value to more than half the claim of the United
States But even this is a mere estimate The
first misuse of the public money by Mr Swart-
wout, as collector, appears to have commenced in
1830 A series of defalcations, in various items
of his accounts, seem to have followed, and con-
tinued through each successive year, increasing
constantly in amount, till near the close of his
official term They consisted in withholding a
part of the tonnage duties, and a portion of the for-
feitures and fines, in not accounting for all the
bonds collected, nor all the moneys on hand, held
either for office expenses, return duties, or in ad-
vance of the adjustment of unascertained duties;
and in piocunng from the Treasury, under the
act of 1834, and similar ones, larger sums for the
balance of office salaries than the facts warranted
These results, so unexpected and painful, have
been reached by the Solicitor and accounting o  i-
ceis, only after the most careful examination that
was practicable, in the absence of Mr Swartwout,
and after full communication from several of his
former clerks, most intimately acquainted with the
official course of his business and the real condi-
tion of his accounts, and one of whom is under-
stood to be his attorney
Further paiticulais are forborne to be detailed,
as they are embodied in tne reports of theSolicitor
of the Treasury and the Comptroller, wmch were
made in the course of their íecent examination,
and are annexed It is true that this inquiry has,
from necessity, been in some degree ex parte in its
character, and that some of the results are liable
to be disproved or explained away hereafter
This Depaitment would be highly gratified if
Mr. Swartwout should, m the end, be able to
