HEADQUARTERS,Wheeling, Va., February 6, 1862-10 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Lander reports from Patterson's Creek, has Romney and is ten iles in advance; wants only two cavalry companies. Why should all the regiments be kept at New Creek? Stream south of Raleigh impracticable. The plan of breaking Southwest Virginia and Tennessee should take in west side of Sandy; the troops there and on my side will suffice; can do it soon. Floyd fortifying at Newberne.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Washington, D. C., [February 6,] 1862.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Wheeling, Va.:

Colonel Piatt telegraphs to Secretary of War from Cabell Court-House that rebels are coming with artillery, and asks for one regiment and one battery from Ohio. I think it a stampede; but if it is not, call on Ohio. I am anxious to send all Ohio troops just now to Buell to support attack on Fort Henry, so do not take troops if you can avoid it. Will send back your four Ohio regiments to-morrow from New Creek. Enemy have men from Romney. Write you to-morrow.

G. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.
