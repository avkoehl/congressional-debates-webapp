General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

My telegrams of 18th and 20th instant are still unanswered, asking authority to receive State volunteers and others in service for defense of Charleston and Savannah. Time for so doing all-important. More troops are absolutely required in this department or railroad to Savannah must be abandoned. I also make another appeal for two comment brigadier-generals to command troop under General Mercer; otherwise I must not be held responsibility for any disaster which may occur there. Please answer.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Accept any armed troops from the States and as may others as we can arm. Let me know what number of arms you will require, that I may inform to what extent we can supply them. The troops and men to be accepted should not be raised in derogation of the conscript law.
