CAMP CHASE, OHIO, December 22, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel A. H. POTEN, Commanding Prisons:

SIR: As per request I beg leave to report that I have under my care as surgeon, in prison No. 3, about 1,600 men. The sick during my attendance, two weeks, has averaged about 1 1/4 per cent. Their quarters are, by the aid of stoves, I think comfortable. They are well fed, some of them rather thinly clad, which I understand can be remedied on application to the proper authority. Their general health is good as could be expected under like circumstances.

Very respectfully submitted.

I. M. ABRAHAM,

Acting Assistant Surgeon.
