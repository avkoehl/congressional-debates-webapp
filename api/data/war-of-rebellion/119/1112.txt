HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WESTERN LOUISIANA,OFFICE OF INSPECTOR-GENERAL,

In the Field, March 29, 1864.

Colonel C. C. DWIGHT,

Com'r of Exchange on the part of Major General N. P. Banks:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th instant, assenting to the immediate delivery and exchange of prisoners held respectively by Major-General Banks and Taylor.

Major-General Taylor instructs me to inform you that steps have been taken to have the prisoners in his hands, including all those captured up to this date, brought from Shreveport, and the least possible delay will be had.

Red River being obstructed above Alexandria, its navigation is dangerous, but the prisoners will be brought on boat to as low point as possible and thence taken to your outposts and delivered.

I have to request that those prisoners who are in your hands may be delivered at once at our outpost, to be held under parole until the exchange is perfected.

I hope that the efforts to obtain the return of the Fort Butler prisoners will be continued.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILL M. LEVY,

Major, Asst. Adjt. and Insp. General and Commissioner, &c.
