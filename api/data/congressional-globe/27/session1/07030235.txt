27th Cons,— 1st
Loan Bill—Mr. Jones.
H. ot Reps.
hive been since much more clearly developed
Why, sir, urgent as was the alleged necessity
which brought us together, and large as was the
estimated deficiency in the resources of the Govern-
ment on the 1st of September next, during the tix
weeks we have been in session we have scarcely
heard of the Trea&ury—I mean in the form of a
bill calculated to relieve the wants and necessities
complained of And what must have been the as
tomshment ot the people when they came to be in-
formed that one of the first acts of this Admmis-
tration, which comes into power on its professions
of economy and retrenchment, was, not to re
plenish, but to take from the Treasury from three
to five millions of dollars annually, and give it
awaj,—yes, with an empty Treasury, >ou give
away million*, and thus produce the necessity for
a loan. You ihen borrow extravagantly, and rely
upon the debt of your own creation to produce a
like necessi y to impose additional taxes on the
people
It can now be no longer disguised, tnat all hands
have been busily enganeü m concocting a series of
measures to break do *n the great landmarks be-
tween the dd Democratic and Federal parties, by
the establishment of a Bank of the United Slate*,—
yes, of a Government Bank, which, I am pieased
to see, has been placed, ía the message of the Pre-
sident of the United States, on the ground that it
has been condemned by the people of this country,
by the eitablishment, too, of a tariff, which the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr Adams) but
the other day charged his party with dodging, a
measure which has once thaken this Union to its
foundations,and by the distribution of the proceeds
of the sales of the public land*, thus cutting off one
of the principal sources of the revenue of the Go-
vernment, and lhat the only one in which the peo-
ple bear equally the pu ilic burdens. Thes^ are the
great objects to b* accomplished, and under c r
cumstances which put it out ot the power of the
people of the States to act through their Legisla-
tures, should they be disposed to do so, and «hen
two of the States of this Union are without a repre-
sentative on tnis floor
I am admonished by the hand of the clock that
it is time I had commenced an examination of the
report of the Secretary of the Treasu y on the
state of the finances, foi that i  the foundation
on which this bill is mads to rest, a report, sir,
which I must charactenze as inaccurate, delusivi,
deceptive, and eminently calculated to mislead
ihe public mind, thou?h, probably, not so in-
tended. I do not charge that it was su mtended,
for I attribute improper motives to no one; but I
speak of the report as 1 find it And I am not at
all surprised that the honorable chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, in his opening
speech, should have handled it so delicately, he ap-
peared to me to be almost afraid to touch it, he
has, however, given to it a sort of half way en-
dorsement. In some of the statements he has ex-
pressed his concurrence, while he has passed over
others, equally important, wholly unnoticed. If
time would permit, it is my wish careiully to ex-
amine every statement which it contains. It
would, m my opinion, sir, be time well spent, it
could not fail to satisfy us that, upon the subject
of finance at least, there remains much yet to be
learned.
Sir, when I have charged that thi report is m
accurate, that it is delusive, deceptive, and calcula-
ted to mislead the public mmd, it will be expec -
that I shall furnish some evidence of the truth of
these charges. This I will now proceed to do. In
my opinion, there is no individual in this wide com-
munity who has more cause to complain of this
report than the President himself. Let it not be
understood that I make any charge against the
President I take it for granted that his communi-
cation i to Congress; upon this branch of the sub-
subject, are based upon statements furnished to
hira from the Treasury Department; and although
it is tobe supposed that the President should be
well acquainted with the financial affairs of the
country, yet he cannot be expected to understand
the details so well as the officer who has the espe-
cial charge of the Department
"Jhe first discrepancy, or error, which I propo&e
to notice, is to be found on page 2 of the report,
in a statement which purports to give the bal \nce
in the Treasury on the 4th of March, 1841,
it is there represented to be -           -        $572,718
On page 3 the Secreiary   sa>s the
available balance in the Treasury
on   the 4th  of  Ma^ch,   1841, is         546 830
Difference         -           -           -           74,085
The  President  represents  the   balance on  the
same day to be $645 000
We have here ttuee statements of the balance m
ihe Treasury on the 4ih of March, 1841, all differ-
ing in amount Certain it is, that all cannot be
right, and, if I have not .grossly deceived myself, I
shall have no difficulty m «aüsfvmg the commit-
tee that they are all wrong, and that the true
balance exceeds the largest sum by nearly one
million of dolíais
The President  says (page 6)   that
there  is   an «nis«ued balance of
Treasury notes aumonzej by the
act of 1841, amounting to -        -     $1,955,000
The  Secieiary (page   4) states the
Treasury   notes   authorized   by
the act of the 15th  of February,
1841, tobe

If it be said that thi  statement of
the Presidentas intended to cover
the whole of the alleged balance,
including Treasury notes redeema-
ble in 1842, then the Secretary
makes th  whok of what he calls
debt and deficit in this year and
next, including the redemption of
these Treasury notes (page 3)

An honorable member has informed us that
figures cannot he, if this be true, here are the
figures, taken from the message and report, with a
reference to the pages of eech. It there be doubt
still resting upon the mind of any gentleman, let
him examine for|himself, and his doubts will vanish
like mist before the morning sun
Sir, how are these things to be accounted for? They
are errors of vast magnitude, as all will agree; and
and if there be any rational solution of the diffi-
culties suggested, let some friend of the Secretary
stand forth here in his defence, and remove them.
It is due to the Secretary, it is due to the President,
and, above all, to the people, whose interests are
involved. Extra numbers of these documents
have been printed by thousands; tbey have been
circulated far and wide, borne on the fiery wings
of steam, they have reached the remotest corners
of our country, they have found their way across
the irackless ocean, and there, an here, handed
over  to the people through the columns of the
public press, and a'though I know that correction
follows but slowly m the path of error,-let the
effort be made, and, if possible, these conflicting
statements reconciled
Sir, the members upon this floor have been mis
led and deceived by this document Hew often has
it been repeated within this Hall, that there was
a debt of more thai thirty millions incurred by the
late Administration, and to be paid by this: and
this report of the Secretary referred to, to support
the charge? The editors of newspapers, too,
throuf bout the country, have been betrayed into
the same error No sooner was this document
printed and published, than the batteries of the
precs were opened—that press which is ¡«o power-
ful an engine to form and to control public opi-
nion The charge has been rung through ihe
length aud breadth of the country, that there was
thirty millions of public debt, "a Van Buren lega-
cy," which this Government had now to pay. Is
the charge true' For its refutation I might safely
rely upon this bill, which provides for all which the
Secretaiy can even render plausible, including mil-
lions of new appropriations proposed by this Admi-
nistration, and embraced by the Secretary in his
estimate of "tfe&i" and "defied "
I propose now very briefly to examine the state-
ments ot the Secretary, whi^n have contributed to
this result The first to which I shall call the at-
tention of the committee is that which shows the
outstanding balance of appropriations on the 4th
of March, 1841, amounting to $3i,429,616. Can
this be regarded as a debt') Possibly it may, and
hence the necessity ot some explanation. It con-
sists, first, of new and permanent appropriations
for the service of the current year, amounting to
$19,719 095, and, secondly, of the unexpended ba-
lances of former appropriations making the whole
charge, of every description, on the 4th of March,
1841, $33 429,616 About $18,000 000 of this
amount was c eated by bills which passed Con-
gress at the very heel of the last session, intended
to provide for the current service of the year; and
the ink is scarce dry upon the bills, before the
amouiit provided is converted into public debt'
Sir, I again ask, tan it be regarded as a debt1 With
equal propuety, and full as much justice, might ihe
appropriations  for  ihs current service ot   1837,
amounting to                   -           -   $37,755,606
And the balance of old appropriations
then outstanding -                              19,503,019
Making together - 57,258 625
Be churged to General Jackson's administration, as
a debt to be paid by Mr. Van Buren's, or those for
1828, amounting to -           -           -   $22 642,408
With the balance of old appropria-
tion,       ....       3,737,533
Making together            -     26,279,941
As a debt handed over from the administration of
Mr Aftamv, to be paid by that of Geeeral Jack-
son But who ever dreamed of making such a
charge? It has been left to thtse days of enhght
ened economy to make the d.scovery that this is a
debt
To meet this outstanding balaree of
aipropnationson the 4th of March,
1841, amounting to         -           -   $33,429,616
The late Secreiary of the Treasury
submitted the following estimate
of means for the year
