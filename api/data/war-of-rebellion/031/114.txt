[CHAP. XXXIII.

[Indorsements.]
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,December 22, 1862.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Birney, with request that he report on the within. Please return.

By command of Brigadier-General Stoneman, commanding corps:

A. J. ALEXANDER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, THIRD CORPS,Camp, December 22, 1862.

The major-general commanding center grand division was misinformed. My division did not lose the road. My orders were to follow Sickle's division. The artillery of that division being in its rear, and progressing slowly, delayed my command, but it bivouacked at the point ordered, and as soon as the road was clear of Sickle's artillery. My orders prevented me from passing or cutting Sickle's column.

Respectfully forwarded.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS CENTER GRAND DIVISION,Phillips House, December 13, 1862.

Brigadier General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Commanding Third Corps:

I am directed by the major-general commanding to instruct you to support Major-General Franklin, in case that officer should call on you for support. Until that time you will hold your command well in hand, in readiness to cross the river at a spring. The watch word for the day is "Scott." To prevent any collision of our own troops in the fog, it should be given to every company.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOS. DICKINSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CENTER GRAND DIVISION,Phillips House, December 13, 1862.

Brigadier General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Commanding Third Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you place your two divisions in position to cross at the lower ford, at a moment's notice, in support of Franklin, and Whipple's division ready to cross at the three upper bridges, in support of Sumner.

Very respectfully,

JOS. DICKINSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
