(Received 3 p. m.)

Major General JOHN POPE:

I have not had telegraph communication with plains for several days. High water in Platte and Loup Fork has washed out cable or torn down line at these crossings. Will send in lists of officers as soon as I can hear from them. Does it include brevet brigadier-generals? I desire to go forward on the record, when you take it up, with such indorsements as you can consistently give me.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Major General JOHN POPE:

Lieutenant-Colonel Davis reports by letter, dated Helena, Ark., May 20, that he has got through at Wittsburg, on Saint Francis River, and is on the way to Jacksonport. He paroled at Wittsburg 2,100 men and officers, and General Thompson says there will be three times as many at Jacksonport. Everything went off satisfactory. But little public property was turned over.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., June 1, 1865.

(Received 3 p. m.)

Major-General POPE:

The detachments sent out by General Ford to scout the Dry Fork, Walnut Creek, Smoky Hill Fork, and main Republican, all send in reports that they find no Indians between Arkansas and Platte River and no new signs. It is evident that the depredations on the southern route came from Indians far south, who send up small parties. The main expedition is after them.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
