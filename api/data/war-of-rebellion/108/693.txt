HEADQUARTERS,Near Suffolk, April 21, 1863.

Colonel W. H. STEVENS,

Chief Engineer, Department of Northern Virginia:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 17th instant, which has received the consideration of the commanding general. It is somewhat impracticable, at present, to decide upon the most advantageous points for the erection of defensive works, but it is thought that that suggested by Colonel Gwynn at the mouth of Potecasi Creek, near the junction of the Meherrin and Nottoway Rivers, officers inducements to fortify. The commanding general requests, therefore, that you will direct the construction at that point of such works as may be found necessary.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

[18.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Suffolk, April 22, 1863.

Major General J. B. HOOD,

Commanding Division:

If you have not already so directed, the commanding general desires you to order General Law to make an abatis in front of his line, say fifty yards in front, by cutting down pine saplings, with the branches cut and sharpened, about three feet long. He wishes it done at once, and in the best manner that you can devise.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

[18.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Suffolk, April 22, 1863.

Major General G. E. PICKETT,

Commanding Division:

The commanding general desires you to have a careful examination made of the swamp and its approaches by which the enemy may gain your rear. At all such points, or where is any possibility of his making a movement round you, you should have pickets to watch them and give prompt information of any movement. I am directed to caution you against any of the enemy's efforts to surprise. Extreme vigilance and energy are required, and it is expected that you will give the subject every attention.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

[18.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
