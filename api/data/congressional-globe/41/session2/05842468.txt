SAN DOMINGO TREATY.
The SPEAKER also, by unanimous consent,
laid beiore the House a message from the
President of the United States, in reply to a
resolution of the House of .Representatives of
March 28, 1870, in which the President was
requested, if not incompatible with the public
set \ ice, to " communicate to this House a copy
of the list of privileges in the olflce of the
Secretary of Slate accompanying or relating
to the San Domingo treaty; giving the names
of tho parties and companies to whom have
been granted lands, mines, franchises, and
privileges of all kinds by tho Dominican Gov-
ernment; also, the amount of money paid out
by our Government preliminary to and con-
cerning tho negotiation of said treaty, to whom
and for what purposes, and out of what fund
paid," transmitting a report from the Secre-
tary of State, in which it is stated not to be
compatible with the jiublic interest to com-
municate the information aslced for while the
subject is pending in executive session.
Mr, BROOKS, ofNewYork. I do not recol-
lect where that resolution came from.
The SPEAKER,. If there be no objection-
the message will be referred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. COX. The resolution was offered by
the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Mongex.]
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I wish to
make this remark, that it seems to mo on a
matter in reference to which we have large
appropriations to make it is quite as important
for us to know the amount of money to be
appropriated as for the Senate.
Mr. COX. With the permission of the Chair,
I would suggest that we ought to have this in-
formation before us as soon as possible after
tho matter has been disposed of by the Senate,
1 drew that resolution, but could not offer it
myself and my friend from Ohio [Mr. Muxgen]
offered it. If the country were in possession
of the information asked for this San Domingo
matter would stop, and the House would stop it.
Mr. BANKS. This subject does not require
discussion. The treaty is not before the House,
but before the Seuate, and the information has
been properly withhold.
Mr. COX. Tho gentleman from Massachu-
setts is mistaken; the subject has been attempted
to be brought before the House in the bill for
tlu: annexation of San Domingo brought in
yesterday.
Mr. BANKS. I demand the previous ques-
tion on the motion to refer the papers to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and ordering
them to be printed.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the operation
thereof tho motion was agreed to.

Mr. SCHENCK. Before moving to go into
committee I am willing to yield to my col-
league, [Mr. MtWGEtf.]
Mr. INGERSOLL. It is so important that
the tariff' bill should be considered, I object to
any irregularities. I demand the regular order.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move that the rules be
suspended, and the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole upon the special
order.
The motion was agreed to.
l'AJUFF BILL.
The House accordingly resolved itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, (Mr. Wheeler in tho chair,) and re-
sumed the consideration of the special order,
being the bill (II. 11. No. 1008) to amend exist-
ing laws relating to the duty on imports, and
for other purposes.
The CHAIRMAN. The CTltrk will report
the pending paragraph and the amendment
pending thereto.
The pending paragraph was the following:
On cordials, liqueurs, arrack, nbsintho, liirsch-
wasser, vermuth, ratalia, and other similar spiritu-
ous beverages, or bittors containing spirits, and not
otherwise provided for, §2 per proof gallon; Pro-
vided, That any brandy or other spirituous liquors
imported in cases of less than 14 gallons sliatl bo
forfaited to tho United States.
The pending amendment was to strike out
" 2 " and insert "21."
Mr. COBURN. I cannot understand why
the committee should propose to reduce from
$2 50 to $2 the duty on "cordials, liqueurs,
arrack, absinthe, kirscli-wasser, vermuth, rata-
fia, and other similar spirituous beverages, or
bitters containingspirits." These articles are
not in common use; they are not necessaries
of life. They are beverages, and purely mat-
ters of luxury. They tend to promote the
vicious habits of men. Tliey tend to breed
vice. They tend to destroy the health of those
who use them, and who, I am afraid, will use
them, no matter what duty you putupon them.
I think that these articles should bo put upon
the same basis as brandy, because they are
beverages in the same way as brandies aiid
other spirits manufactured or distilled are bev-
erages. If these are admitted at a lower rate
of duty brandy will be altered, and whisky
will be altered, so as to be brought in under
some of these names, as liqueurs, bitters, cor-
dials, or something of that kind.
[ say that no temptation should be held out
lo parties to make these alterations or perpe-
trate these frauds. It strikes me that when we
have changed the bill so as to provide a higher
rate of duty upon brandy or distilled spirits,
we should also have a higher rate of duty upon
articles of this kind. Indeed I do not know
bat it would be a public blessing if some of
these articles could be prevented entirely from
being imported. Some of them, as absinthe,
are terrible poisons, and a duty upon absinthe
is really a tax upon suicide; for it is about as
speedy and sure a way of committing suicide,
to drink absinthe, as any other way that could
be suggested. It is sure death taken in suf-
ficient quantity.
Mr. SCIIKNCK. The gentleman deserves
great credit for being a worthy advocate of the
great temperance cause; but 1 marvel not a
little that he should insist so strongly on put-
ting the duty on brandy at $3 while he is will-
