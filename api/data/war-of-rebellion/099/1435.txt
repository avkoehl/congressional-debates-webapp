Creek. I said "hearing that the infantry had crossed," &amp;c., and meant our infantry. The creek I have been skirmishing on to-day is three miles in front of Mingo. Finding this evening that the road from Stallings Bridge to Smithfield was open, I have sent a squadron to Draughan's Cross-Roads to picket that road. There is not other force on it. Colonel Dibrell did at one time cover this road, but it seems has moved farther to the left.

Very respectfully, &c.,

WM. W. ALLEN,
