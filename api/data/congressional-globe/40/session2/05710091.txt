importance. He has not the power to select
men of his own choice. Why, even for the
very highest offices in the land, although oppos-
ing Congress in its miscalled "reconstruction"
policy, the President, takes the elect of the
Radical party. Look at our foreign missions
where vacancies have occurred. Mr. Bancroft
was appointed to one, and Mr. Raymond to
another. Then Mr. Greeley, the very head and
front of the party, was nominated for one of the
first positions under the Government. It is
not true that the President, even where he has
had the power of appointment, has confined
himself to his own friends in making the selec-
tion. He hasbeen compelled, in all these reve-
nue cases, so far as my knowledge extends,
either to take men of the dominant party or
those with whom they were satisfied or leave
the offices unfilled. Andif, in selecting among
them, he finds one thief out of a dozen, I do
not think it is at all remarkable, and I am only
surprised that he has not been more unlucky
than he has in this particular.
We are alarmed, Mr. Speaker; and honor-
able gentlemen seem surprised at the cry of
distress that comes up to us from all parts of
the land. A once happy, free, and prosperous
people find themselves upon the very brink of
financial and commercial ruin, while trembling
between the Scylla of anarchy and the Cha-
rybdis of despotism that threaten to engulf
our brightest prospects and fondest hopes for-
ever. But why should we be surprised at our
present condition? The experience of all ages,
the lessons of all history would have warned
us of the rocks against which we were madly
dashing if we had but listened to their voices.
No people on earth could long exist without
utter ruin under the system of misrule, profli-
gacy, and debauchery inaugurated by the men
who now unhappily control the destinies of our
country. Even if the system of peculation and
robbery of which I have been speaking could
be stopped, the expenditures actuallv author-
ized by law would crush any people. The hard-
earned money of our people is recklessly voted
away and squandered as if our resources were
endless and the means and patience of the
masses inexhaustible.
Nearly three long years have passed since
the surrender of the last, army of the confed-
erates brought gladness and hope to the hearts
of our people. If the men who had control
of our Government had permitted the Consti-
tution of our fathers to extend its protection
and benign influences to every part of the land,
and had at the same time inaugurated a system
of strict economy in the administration of the
Government, we would to-day be the happiest
and most prosperous people on earth. But
this would not answer the ends or purposes
of the Radical faction. The founders of their
sect had denounced the Constitution as a
"covenant with death and an agreement, with
hell," and now, drunken and debauched with
their ill-gotten power, our rulers trampled that
sacred instrument under their feet and inaugu-
rated their most wretched and wicked system
of revolution and subversion. And this wicked
scheme naturally and inevitably led to the
adoption of measures that have quadrupled the
expenditure of the Government. A bureau,
at an enormous expense, to feed, clothe, and
proselyte to radicalism a horde of lazy, vaga-
bond negroes; a large standing army; an
expensive military despotism in the South,
extending its withering and blighting influences
to every part of the land; a horde of Federal
office-holders spread all over the land to spy
out and seize upon the substance of the peo-
ple; these were all appropriate sequences of
this wicked purpose to destroy the Constitution
and establish a Radical despotism in its stead.
We have had profound peace, Mr. Speaker,
for nearly three \ears. From the surrender
of the confederate armies in April, 18G';, to
the present time there has not been an arm
raised anywhere against the power of the Fed-
eral Government. Why, then, these enormous
expenditures, that are crushing the very life
out of the people ? Why should the ordinary
expenses of the Government now greatly ex-
ceed those of the years immediately preceding
the war. Mr. Buchanan's Administration has
always been characterized by the party now in
power as most reckless and extravagant. I
am not here now for the purpose of.defending
it. But let us compare for a moment the last
and most extravagant year of Buchanan's Ad-
ministration with the expenditures now inaug-
urated under Radical rule. Men may mislead
the ignorant by frothy declamation, but figures
are stubborn things, and when used fairly never
mislead. In the figures I now give I do not
include the public debt or the interest thereon,
nor the pensions and bounties to soldiers and
their families, all of which the people will
cheerfully pay.
The Secretary of the Treasury asks for ap-
propriations for this year as follows :
For the War Department, exclusive of bounties and
pensions   $05,000,000
For the Navy Department  36,000,000
For civil service  51,000,000
$182,000,000
There can be no doubt that the actual de-
mands and expenditures of the Government
under existing legislation will greatly exceed
even this enormous sum. For who ever heard
of a Congress in these days without a series
of deficiency bills ? The expenditures invari-
ably exceed greatly the estimates.
The whole expenditures of the Government
for the same service in 18C0 (the last year of
Mr. Buchanan's Administration) were;
For civil list S6,077,000
For the War Department  1(3,563,000
For the Navy Department 11,514,000
Total $31,154,000
Difference between tho estimates for 186S and actual
expenditures tor the same items iulS60...$147,847,000
Thus it is demonstated that the ordinary
expenditures of the Government under Radi-
cal rule is more than five times as great as it
was under the much-abused Administration of
Buchanan.
We have been accustomed to call ours a free
and happy and prosperous people. But, sir,
no people can be properly called free or pros-
perous, whatever may be the form of govern-
ment, whose daily earnings are wrung from
them by the tax-gatherer to feed a horde of
hungry vultures who are preying upon them.
We now pay in taxes nearly twice as much per
capita as any other people in the world. And
it will be seen from the foregoing figures that,
even if our national debt were wiped out as
with a sponge, we would still, under our pres-
ent rulers, be the worst taxed and worst gov-
erned people on earth. The people should in
thunder tones demand of this Congress—" Why
does this country, in time of peace, with no
prospect of war, requirefive times more expend-
itures, in proportion to its population, for the
Army or the Navy or the civil list, than it ever
required at any time before the Republican
party came into power?" Your wretched, un-
constitutional, and most wicked policy, your
negro bureaus, your largo standing army, your
military despotism, your hordes ot hungry vul-
tures sent nil over the land to devour the sub-
stance of the people, turnish the answer. Sir,
the Republican party has been trusted by the
people as no party was ever trusted before,
and their generous confidence has in every
respect been most shamefully abused. 1 know
it is easy to indulge in loose and idle declama-
tion and censure; and lest I might be accused
of sinning ill this direction I will furnish here
for the consideration of the House and of the
country some tables compiled from the ar-
chives of our Government, upon which 1 wish
to base a few additional remark?, and which
will demonstrate beyond all possibility ot con-
tradiction the folly, recklessness, and extrava-
gance of the party that now most unfortunately
controls the expenditures of our Government:

181 4  30,127,606 38
Total 8172,697,779 00
Thus it is seen that the entire expenditures of
our Government from the foundation thereof
to the 1st day of January, 1815, including the
expenses of the last British war, does not equal
by over eleven million dollars what is now re-
quired for the mere ordinary expenses of the
Government for the present year under Radical
rule. I say ordinary, as I do not in the estimates
given include the amount required for bounties,
pensions, and interest ou the public debt. Brit
these expenditures which I have given are, in
fact, most extraordinary, and enough to cause
the very clods of our mother earth to rise in
mutiny against the further rule of such a party.
It will be seen by looking at the foregoing
table that the whole aggregate expenditures of
the Government during the three years (1812,
1813, and 1814) of our last great struggle with
Great Britain, in which we met and grappled
in the death-struggle on land and sea with the
greatest Power on earth, amounted only to
§76,089,502, which is $105,960,498 less than
it now costs to run the Government in a time
of profound peace for one year under Radical
rule ; and that, too, without counting the frauds
and robberies perpetrated under our revenue
system, and which may be estimated at at least
fifty millions more, that never reaches the Treas-
ury, but every dollar of which is wrung from
the pockets of the toiling millions.
But it may be urged that these comparisons
are not fair, and are calculated to mislead, as
the population was much less in the early days
of the Republic than now, and the expendi-
tures necessarily less than now. Admit all
that can be fairly claimed from this fact, and
yet it does not weaken tlie startling character
of the facts I have given. Surely no one will
contend that it ought to cost more, or at least
much more, per capita to administer our Gov-
ernment as we increase in population than
it did during the caily and struggling days of
the Republic. If it does necessarily have this
result we should in self-defense immediately
put a stop to immigration, and go back as speed-
ily as possible to our original boundaries. But
it cannot possibly produce this result if the
Government were now administered on the
principles on which it was founded. Taking
this as indisputable, I will now furnish another
table that will place in a still stronger light
the enormities of our present, system :
