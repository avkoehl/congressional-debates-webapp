THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 25,
dollar? It is a fallacy to suppose that the de-
preciation of our currency is due solely to its
irredeemability, and not at all to its excess.
In this connection I will make use of a para-
graph from Perry's Political Economy as per-
tinent to this matter. Referring to the period
of suspension in England, ho says:
" 'Xhe earlier period of suspension proves this im-
portant point: that when a Government possesses
a monopoly of issuing paper money, and carefully
limits the quantity issued, and both receives it and
pays itoutas legal tender, it may keep an inconvert-
ible paper at par. and even by sufficiently limiting
its quantity carry it above par."
But it is said by some that the rate of inter-
est determines the amount of currency re-
quired, and that because a high rate of interest
wow prevails a larger volume of currency is
demanded. No reasoning could be more spe-
iious nor more unsound. Strange as it may
.seem, the history of the country more gen-
erally shows that the rate of interest is high-
est when the volume of circulation is largest,
and lowest when the volume of circulation is
smallest. In other words, though it appears
like a paradox, money is oftener cheap and
plenty when it is limited, and dear and scarce
when it is excessive. In 1836, just before the
great convulsion, and when the volume of cur-
rency was larger than it had ever been in our
country up to that time, the rate of interest
rose as high as thirty per cent. So in 1857,
when the circulation was again greatly ex-
panded, the rate of interest rose to even higher
figures. On the other hand, in 1840, when
after the panic the circulation had been greatly
reduced, interest was down to five percent.;
and in 1858, when the volume had again dimin-
ished, the rate was even less than five per
cent.
Undoubtedly other disturbing causes may
enter and affect the fluctuations, but the rec-
ords of our financial history for the past forty
years show a remarkable coincidence between
the volume of the currency and the rate of
interest. Nor need we search far to find the
philosophy of this law. When the currency is
expanded prices arc raised, speculation is in-
variably and inordinately stimulated, and there
is an unusual demand for money. When,
on the contrary, the currency is contained
within its natural and proper limits, specula-
tion is checked, money is not diverted from its
legitimate channels, and the "demand does not
exceed the supply. It is not surprising that
while an expanded currency is in process of
recession that the interest rate should be tem-
porarily increased, for men are compelled to
meet their indebtedness at a sacrifice, and a
new pressure is created. In our own case
there is another important element to be con-
sidered. The Government is paying a high
rate of interest upon its own loans, and indi-
vidual loans are largely regulated by it. From
these particular facts and general considera-
tions, it will be apparent that the prevailing
rate of interest is no evidence whatever of the
inadequacy of our circulation.
I shall make no attempt, as I have already
stated, to determine the exact amount of cur-
rency required by the country. Once started
upon the right basis, this problem will solve
itself. It is important, then, to ascertain if
we can, how we can make our paper currency
and gold equivalent; how we can secure the
necessary proportion between the amount of
gold we can command and the amount of
currency it is to make redeemable, and how
we shall hold the gold which is essential to the
maintenance of the specie basis. The bill
under consideration does not retard in any
material respect, and I regret to say does not
tend to advance this most desirable result.
The three per cents, are, indeed, equivalent to
so much currency; but it will be seen in practice
that while there has been simply an exchange
of one form for another, the $45,000,000 of
notes will be found far more difficult to get rid
of than the same amount of certificates.
There is no difficulty in the currency question
save that which grows out of its appreciation,
with the consequent decline of prices and in-
crease of nominal indebtedness. How does the
community, letmeinquire, feel an increase or
decrease of the currency? Simply in the depre-
ciation or appreciation of values; simply in the
rise or the decline of prices, and in the conse-
quences flowing from the one or the other.
Neither contraction nor inflation is felt in the
mere operation its elf. It is felt only in its effects;
and if those effects could be accomplished in any
other way the influences and results would be
precisely the same. During the past few years
our gold and gold bonds have been steadily
flowing abroad. In the last year alone over
thirty-seven millions of specie and bullion, in-
dependent of interest obligations, have been
exported, as shown by Commissioner Wells.
Could it be otherwise? Could the precious
metals possess a higher value elsewhere and
yet remain here ? We may we^ *u.rn 'h® sig-
nificant lessons of history upon this point.
In 1816, after the Bank of the United States
was rechartered, it rapidly and improvidently
expanded its circulation. In a single month
its discounts increased from three to twenty
millions. The result of this management
was that prices rose, speculation greatly in-
creased, and, in the language of the history
which describes the event, gold left the country
in ship-loads. We had cheapened gold, and
being the common standai'd of the world, tend-
ing to equalize itself everywhere, and passing
readily from one nation to another, it flowed,
by an irresistible law to lands where for the
time it possessed a higher value, and it kept
flowing until a change of condition arrested the
tide. The same fact has been repeated several
times within the recollection of many Senators
who honor me with their attention.
The history of other nations furnishes illus-
trations no less striking and suggestive. During
the prolonged suspension of specie payments
in England, at the beginning of the present
century, the paper currency was largely aug-
mented in volume. The country banks, which
numbered two hundred and ten in 1799 had
increased to nearly a thousand in 1814. The
Bank of England, also, had greatly enlarged
its own circulation. In 1816, however, many
of the banks failed, and the volume of cur-
rency was reduced to nearly half the amount
of 1814. Corresponding to this the premium
on gold declined from thirty per cent, to less
than two per cent., though it rose the next year
to full two and a half. What I desire to show,
Mr. President, is that even upon this small
premium, or, in other words, upon a slight
depreciation of the paper currency, the tend-
ency of gold was to flow away from the country,
and a transaction of that very year supplies a
most forcible illustration. _ In 1817 the bank,
though the suspension continued, paid out sev-
eral millions of gold upon voluntary obliga-
tions. But this gold had no effect whatever in
improving the general condition; on the con-
trary, it speedily departed from the country,
and Eobert Peel, in referring to the subject at
a late day, said :
" The issue of that treasure had not been attended
with any good to the nation, and he thought indeed
it might have been foreseen that unless this issue had
been accompanied by a simultaneous reduction of
bank notes the gold would find its way to those places
where there was a greater demand for it."
It seems to me that these words are strik-
ingly applicable to the situation in which our
nation is to-day.
It can hardly fail to be of interest and value
to trace the history of those times a little fur-
ther, since they bear an obvious analogy to
these in which we live. As before stated, there
was a large reduction of the circulation in 1816.
Thereafter its depreciation was exceedingly
small, averaging scarcely more than three per
cent. Yet, in order to overcome even thig
slight barrier without creating disturbances,
the great currency measure of 1819 allowed
three years for the resumption of specie pay-
ment. Between 1814 and 1822 $215,000,000
of currency (reduced to dollars) had been with-
drawn from circulation. The period of resump-
tion was signal of hardship, as was to be
expected, though the convulsion usually asso-
ciated with this event did not occur until 1825,
and may be traced to an entirely different cause.
The undue stringency and suffering of 1822 were
the result of a disproportionate and over-rapid
contraction.
I take the liberty to append a table showing
the circulation of the Bank of England from
1797 to 1823, inclusive, which sheds additional
light upon this branch of the discussion. It has
been made up from various sources, and in
one or two points is incomplete:

By a provision of the law, the effect of which
had not been clearly studied, all notes under
the denomination of five pounds were retired
from circulation. Now, in 1819, as will be seen,
when the law was passed, <£7,354,230, or nearly
a third of the entire circulation of the Bank of
England, which was then £25,126,700, con-
sisted of notes under the denomination of five
pounds. The proportion of small notes in the
circulation of the country banks was probably
still larger, though I have found no exact state-
ment of the case. Thus it is that in February,
1822, the aggregate circulation of the Bank of
England had fallen to £18,665,350, a reduction
of nearly seven million pounds, or $35,000,000.
The cancellations of the country banks were
no doubt in proportion.
I conclude, then, that the reduction, under
the constraint of the misjudged provisions to
which I have referred, was far greater than was
