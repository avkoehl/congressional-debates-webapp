The Union League Club is composed of over 500 of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of New York, whose sole bond of association is an unflinching determination to support the Government.

They have subscribed a large sum to be appropriated to the raising of a colored regiment, and will procure much more. They believe that by their exertions, and influence they can, with the permission of the Government, put in the field a regiment worthy to stand side by side with the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts.

If we are so fortunate as to receive your authorization, we shall take immediate steps to carry out our plan, and shall endeavor to present for approval able and experienced officers whose heart is in the work.

We are, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servants,

GEO. BLISS, JR.,

LE G. B. CANNON,

Committee.

I understand that permission has been given to persons in Brooklyn to raise such regiments, and I suppose, therefore, you can get a like authorization.

Yours, truly, &amp;c.,
