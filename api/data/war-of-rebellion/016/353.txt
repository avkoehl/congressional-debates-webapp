munition must be got ready for an immediate movement to the rear. Let me hear from you at once.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

(No record of General McDowell's answer to this.)

WARRENTON JUNCTION,

August 27, 1862-8.30 a.m.

Major-General McDOWELL:

Execute the movement you suggest, but you must be careful not to let the enemy know it until the last moment. Send the trains by this way, and call Banks to you. If the movement could be made by dark it would be better. I will open the road and join you as soon as I can. I do not know that it will be safe to wait, but you can tell better than I, as your scouts and lookouts can see the movements of the enemy. Order Banks to send his train off immediately, and also the trains you have. We must get to Gainesville to-night.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

WARRENTON, VA.,

August 27, 1862-8.45 a.m.

Major-General POPE:

I have just received your telegram of 8.30 a.m. I have ordered Sigel to send immediately a strong advance from his corps to seize the position of Buckland Mills, or Broad Run, and follow immediately with his corps.

Can you spare time, to come to the instrument and have a conversation with me?

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.

WARRENTON AND WARRENTON JUNCTION,

August 27, 1862.

I will be in the telegraphed office here the greater part of the day.

POPE.

McD:

Please let me know when the last of the wagons coming this way leave Warrenton. You had best load all the cars at Warrenton, and send back all the surplus stores fast as possible.

POPE,

REPLY. - I have given such orders.

I. McD.
