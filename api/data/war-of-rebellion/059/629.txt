Brigadier General M. J. WRIGHT,

Commanding at Atlanta:

SIR: It has been reported that there are upward of 300 prisoners confined at this post, against a large number of whom no charges have been preferred. Where it is impracticable to bring the parties to trial, by person of want of witnesses or other good cause, you are respectfully requested to send them to their commands; also, when the witnesses are with the commands of the accused, or when the interests of the service seem to demand their trial there; also in all cases in which charges have not been preferred, a sufficient time for this since the arrests having elapsed. Those intend for trial here ought to have their cases speedily disposed of. The object of all this is to have a general prison delivery.

It has been reported that the condition of the prisons allow communication between the Confederate and Federal prisoners. This ought to be corrected.

By command of General Johnston.
