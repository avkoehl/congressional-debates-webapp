Honorable E. M. STANTON:

There is very great trouble in many counties in Indiana in carrying out the enrollment, and the force under my command is constantly called upon to aid the enrolling officers, notwithstanding the representations made to you that the exercise of military authority by me was unnecessary. I am more than ever satisfied that it is out of the power of the civil authorities to maintain the peace by prompt arrests and punishment. Can I have the authority to declare martial law at such times as I shall think necessary? Depend upon it, I can restore the whole department to perfect quiet if my policy is adopted.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
