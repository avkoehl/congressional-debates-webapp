Telegraph to General Hatch, commanding cavalry of the Army of the Tennessee, now at Clifton, and inform of Lyon's movements, and say to him that I wish him to be on the lookout for Lyon and to try and head him off and catch him.

Colonel PACE,

Columbia:

Colonel Thompson reports that rebel General Lyon, with from 500 to 800 men, crossed the Northwestern railroad near Gillem's. It is possible that he may pass your way; perhaps is making for Florence. Send out scouts well toward river and keep close watch for him. Report all news of enemy promptly.

Major-General THOMAS:

The enemy picket the WEST bank of the Tennessee from Eastport to Perryville. About 4,000 rebels passed up from Corinth through Purdy toward Jackson on the 20th. Forrest was reported at Jackson on the 21st of this month; I am not sure. A column, with artillery, went north through Bolivar. I have not been able to ascertain its strength.
