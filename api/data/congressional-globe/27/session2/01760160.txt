UÚ   '                                      CONGRESSIONAL GLOSE*
the law goes into operation on the 1st of February,
a decree of bankruptcy would be maie in many
cases on that day, by wííich a great many bank-
rupts would be divested of their property, to be
subject to drv< wn amjng their creditors. And if
the law was repeated soon after the decree of b?nk-
rttptcy was made, the question would arise, m
whom was vested the right ot prooerty of which the
bankrupt was divested. He asked whether Con
grcsswonid undertake to reinvest the mht of pro-
perty in the bankrnp* if the law was reoea'ed be-
fore a consummation of the proceeding1! nndT the
decree He pointed out the difficulties sth ch Wculd
arise under the circumstances, and demonstrated
that speedy action was necessary if thsy intended
to act at all 'He suggested that by common con
sent the Senate would agree to take up th  bill on
Monday next The petition isas ref ried to the
Judiciary Committee.
Mr BENTON, ,n reply to Mr Walker, sp'1
the reason why ne hid rot asked the Senate to
consider ih  b'll introduced by bum to pos pone
« that law, was because of the arrival of the bul
f on the Htou«e to repeal that law He would
call for ths House bill the very moment the Frea j
sury Note bill was di*po ed of
Mr. HEiNDEriSON would inquire whether it
was no  m order to as'j for a secon 1 read ng of
the bill from the House to repeal the bill.
Mr SEVIER objected to a second leading of
the bill at this t.me.
Mr KINS said that, if th'bili sheula be real a
second time now, it would take p eotdesce of U e
Treasury Note bill
Mr. HENDERSON remarked that the bill might
be disposed of 10 a smg'e day, it gent emen v ould
now perm t it to be r ip a ^ecoid time Here the
matter was dropped, but

I   or ginated in  the Senile   ?rd passed     I v,isrp-
turned to the House     Ihat oodywoull n t con-
I   adent, on the ground tat lb* Senate had trac-*
scended its constitutional rights by originating such
a bill, which, as wa  then argued and decided, was
a revenue bill to all intents and purposes.
Mr. GRAHAM argued that the Senate could ori-
ginate a loan bill, which he maintained was not a
revenue bill.
Mr. CALHOUN replied that it was not contend-
ed that the bill itself was unconstitutional, but that
the mode of proceed ng was That the Senate had
by its act changed 'he character of the bi'l from a
mere substitute ft r a loan heretofore authorized,
into a revenue bill—which, if m itself did not lay
the tax to supply revenue, at 1'as.t incurred the tax
to supply it
Mr. RIVES argued that the identitv of the bill
was not affee ed by the amendment of the Senate,
by making achan e m the character of the bill it
did no1 des roy ib> tdTnty,
Mr WALKER, did rot conceive that a bill io
bonow money was a bill to raise revenue. A tax
m ght never be levied under i —d might not be
warted The bill to lay the t?x, if wantfd, would
be a bubse jueot and independent act of legislation.
He belie/ed the Sánate bad the rig it to originate a
lean bill, but not a tax bi'l to pay off the loan.
Saci, he confer. Vd, was uie c í-tmct on made by
Mr Jefferson. The time Kad passed at which the
po nt cf order could properly be made. It should
have been made on the q ie¡>t¡on of st iking out the
proviso
Mr CALHOUN withdrew his point of order, for
the purpose, mere'y, of preventing apro.rac ed dis-
cus ion
The question was then taken on the passage of
th  bill, and it was dfc 'ed in the affi ma'ive—Yeas
