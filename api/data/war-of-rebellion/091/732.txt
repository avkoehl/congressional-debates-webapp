HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 3, 1864.

Byt. Major-General MERRITT:

GENERAL: The chief of cavalry directs that you send a strong patrol daily up the Valley pike, as far as Cedar Creek, to obtain all the information possible. Send a report of this patrol every evening to these headquarters. He also desires me to say that you will be held responsible that the enemy does not come north of Cedar Creek in your front, without timely information being sent to these headquarters, and directs that you make such dispositions as will meet with the above. General Custer sends daily patrols up the Back and Middle roads, and is held responsible for his front. The commanding officer of the Second Cavalry Division sends daily patrols to the Shenandoah on the Front Royal pike and keeps the Millwood pike well watched.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. RUSSELL, JR.,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
