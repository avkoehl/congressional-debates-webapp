Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

City Point:

The battalion of the First New York Volunteer Engineers came with the Tenth Corps and I presumed went with it when relieve. I find, however, upon inquire that two companies remained with Captain Gillespie; by whose authority detained I don't know. I have ordered them to be at once sent to General Butler.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

September 26, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Fifth Alabama Battalion, provost guard of A. p. Hill's corps, came into the lines of Major-General Warren, west side of the Weldon railroad, early this a. m. He left his battalion last evening about half a mile above the Canal Basin, near the canal. This is the camp where conscripts are received for A. P. Hill's corps. Informant states that conscripts are arriving in small numbers; some days as many as fifteen or twenty and many days none at all. Those sent to the other corps are not received at this place; no signs of a move when informant left; no re-enforcements received of late. Conscript deserter from the Forty-eighth Georgia Regiment, Wright's brigade, came into the lines of the Ninth Army Corps this morning; has been with the army only a week; can give no information other than that no movements are going in his division, Mahone's.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
