citizens make this a means of escape from volunteer service, what may we expect from enforced service? I beg your consideration of this subject.

I have the honor to be, sir,

A. S. DIVEN,

Acting Assistant Provost-Marshal-General.

OFFICE ACTG. ASST. PROV. March General OF OHIO,

Columbus, Ohio, June 29, 1863.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

COLONEL: I have to call attention to the fact that persons who have been enrolled and who are liable to draft are leaving the country. From Toledo, Sandusky, and Cleveland the district marshals report persons going to Canada. While in Cleveland the other day I was informed by reliable persons that over 400 men had gone from that city since the enrollment was begun.

An authorized person there is employing teamsters for the Army of the Cumberland. He has already sent off about 100 and expects to get 400 more. As these men are not enlisted and can leave the Army at any time, they may evade the draft unless some special regulation be made.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

ED. A. PARROTT,

Colonel and Actg. Asst. Prov. March General for Ohio.

Washington City, June 29, 1863.

J. R. FRY,

Chairman Union League Committee, Philadelphia:

General Couch has no orders from this Department to stop three- months" enlistments. If he has issued such an order it has been through some Harrisburg influence. I will ascertain the facts and make such order as circumstances require.*

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
