seventy-eight of that regiment now in camp. I have parties now out afte those still absent, and hope to secure the return of most of them. Forage is scarce in this vicinity, and it will be necessary to change the location of camp frequently for that reason. The command can be moved in any direction which it may be ordered. There are a few men from nearly every regiment still absent.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH WHEELER,

Major-General.

NEAR GREENSBOROUGH, April 20, 1865.

Brigadier General BRADLEY T. JOHNSON,

General Johnston expects you to preserve the most perfect military order. Of course you can use your infantry in any way to secure this.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General PETTUS,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SALISBURY, N. C., April 20, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER CHARLOTTE, N. C.:

The train which was to have met me here this afternoon has not arrived. I presume it was seized by paroled prisoners and straggling soldiers to convey them to Charlotte. On its arrival there the ringleaders should be seized and severely punished. Send me a locomotive and one car, with a suitable guard, as soon as possible, and inform me when it will arrive.

JOHN C. BRECKINRDIGE,

Secretary of War.

CHARLOTTE, N. C., April 20, 1865.

Brigadier General S. W. FERGUSON,

Catawba Brigade:

Your dispatch of to-day received. General Echols is here, and will give you the needful instructions to secure the co-operation of all the cavalry in this section. When the flag of truce is answered it will be easier to decide what course to pursue.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

General S. W. FERGUSON,
