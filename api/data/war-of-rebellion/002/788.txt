Major A. LORING, Commanding Volunteers, Wheeling, Va.:

MAJOR: You will muster into the service of the State such volunteer companies as may offer themselves, in compliance with the call of the governor, take command of them, and direct the military operations for the protection of the terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on the Ohio River, and also that of the road. It is desirable that the business operations of the company and peaceful travel shall not be interrupted, but be afforded protection. Major F. M. Boykin, jr., has been directed to give protection to the road in the vicinity of Grafton. You will place yourself in communication with him, with the view to cooperate, if necessary. You are requested to report the number of companies you may muster into the service, the state of the arms, condition, and all the circumstances connected therewith.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN McCAUSLAND:

You will proceed tot he valley of the Kanawha, and muster into the service of the State such volunteer companies (not exceeding ten) as may offer their services, in compliance with the call of the governor; take the command of them, and direct the military operations for the protection of that section of country. Your policy will be strictly defensive, and you will endeavor to give quiet and assurance to the inhabitants. It has been reported that two companies are already found in Kanawha County, Captain Patten's and Captain Fife's. It is supposed that others will offer their services. The number of enlisted men to a company, fixed by the Convention, is eighty-two. You will report the condition of the arms, &c., of each company, and, to enable you to supply deficiencies, five hundred muskets, of the old pattern, will be sent. I regret to state that they are the only kind at present for issue. Four field pieces will also be sent you as soon as possible, for the service of which you are desired to organize a company of artillery. The position of the companies at present is left to your judgment, and you are desired to report what points below Charlestown will most effectually accomplish the objects in view.

I am, sir, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

ANDREW TALCOTT, Esq., Colonel, Engineers:

SIR: You will proceed up James River, to the vicinity of Burwell's Bay, and select the most suitable point which, in your judgment, should be fortified, in order to prevent the ascent of the river by the enemy.
