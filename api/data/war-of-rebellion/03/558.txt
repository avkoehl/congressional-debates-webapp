Major General D. HUNTER, U. S. A.,

Commanding First Division, U. S. Troops, en route:

GENERAL: Since forwarding the dispatch of last night, duplicate of which is herewith sent, the general commanding has received more positive information of the movements of the rebel army, which is now, or soon will be, but a day's march from this place. You will therefore see the imperative necessity of moving with the greatest celerity, even if your command has to live on beef alone.

Please acknowledge receipt instantly.

Very respectfully,

J. H. EATON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Same to Generals Pope, McKinstry, Sturgis, and Lane.]

SIR: The major-general commanding directs me to say that you will proceed to organize and prepare for the field the four regiments of your old brigade, now at Cairo or in that vicinity. The necessary orders will be given to move these regiments, to this city of Jefferson City whenever Captain McKeever, assistant adjutant-general, is officially informed that these four regiments can be relieved by four new regiments. The regiments of your former brigade at Paducah cannot be relieved at present.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM McMICHAEL,
