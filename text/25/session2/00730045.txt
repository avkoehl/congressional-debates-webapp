CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

for more than an hour in oppos lion to the post-
ponement He hal no disposition to oppress the
banks of this D strict, but he thought the\, in
common with others had forfeite-i tne  cHims to
public favor lie was in favor of an earl) action
by Congress, on account of the moral effect it
would have m setting a good example to the Staio
[As soon as this speech can be written from the
Reporter's notes it will be given ]
Mr TIPTON said that he would vote f >r th 
motion of the Senator from Kentucky (Mr Claj)
to postpone the consideration of the bih now before
the Senate to the second Monda) i f January next, to
afford time foi us to h^ar fro n the Legislatures of
the States now m session He was opposed to the
issue and ctrculatnn of the s.mall bills or notes, fa-
miliarly calle 1 " thin-plasters," aad w ould go for
freeing the people ot ihe District of Cj'utnbia from
that species of trash He also felt it to be
his dity, so far as Ins vote woulf go, to compel
the banks of the D etnet ti resume spec e pay-
ments at the due we exclnd  -hin pH«iers from
circulation here, but he would not now "ive a
vote to coerce the banks of this District to pay
specie at an earlier day than that at which the
banks of the different States should resume specie
payments It had been indicate! from different
quarters, tnat the first oí Ma) was the time that
would possibly be fixed on bv all solvent banks to
resume specie payments He hoped and believed
that the bank of his own State \iouI 1 not wish to
put off specie pa) ments to i later di) The Legis-
lature of Indiana was now in session, and would
certainly not adjourn witho it taking steps to pro-
duce a result -o desirable to every ono It was
due to the íeputation of the States, as well as to
the note holders an! to public justice, that all such
banks should be compelled if compulsion was
necessary to resume at a da\ not more distant
than th" ti st oi Ma\ S > far as the bank of In-
diana was concerned, no on neel 1 >ubt her incli-
nation, as well as her ability, to resume at an
early day
Mr T said, while on the subject of banks and
paoer currenc), he «ould take occasion to say that
he was m favor of a mixed ci rrency—paper, bot-
tomed ore a metallic basis, convertible at the pleasure of
the holder into gold and silver On such a currency
the State which he had m part the honor to repie-
sent heie had grown to its present important stand
ing among her sister S'ates She had established a
bank, uhich had b°en a 1, conduele 1 in t-n as
beyond doub , ia a wholesome con ' tun, b ih able
and willing tore lime specie o wmemsat any time
He was anxious to see ad binks resume specie
payments let tnose, if any there be, that are not
able to resume, be known He had bo doubt that
the banks of this District were read) to rtsume
and he thought the first ot May a su taole time to
force these small bills out of existence, and let
metal take their places to furnish change to the
people of the District tie coul I not doubt the
ability of the District banks to supply gold and si -
ver for change for the people of this -ueimty
Mr WRIGHT said h  felt himself bound to
call for the jeas and na^s on the mction to post
pone, when there appe ired tor the postponement,
