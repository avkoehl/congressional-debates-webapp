1838.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

of the most wealthy and independent separate
commumties„of the same extent in the world.
By the treaties made and ratified with the Mi
amies, the Chippewas, the Sioux, the Sacs and
Foxes, and the Wmnebagoes, during the last
year, the Indian title to eighteen million four hun-
dred and fifty-eight thousand acres hag been ex
tmguished These purchases have been much
moie extensive than those of any previous year,
and have, with other Indian expenses, borne very
heavily upon the Treasury They leave, how-
ever, but a small quantity of unbought Indian
lands within the States and Territories; and the
Legislature and Executive were equally sensible
of the propriety of a final and more speedy ex
tmction of Indian titles within those limits. The
treaties, which were, with a single exception,
made in pursuance of previous appropriations for
defraying the expenses, have subsequently been
ratified by the Senate, and íeceived the sanction
of Congress by the appropirations necessary to
carry them into effect Of the terms upon which
these important negotiations were concluded, I
can speak fiom direct knowledge, and I feel no
difficulty in affirming that the interest of the In-
dians in the extensive territory embraced by them,
is to be paid for at its fair value, and that no more
favorable teims have been granted to the United
States than would have been íeasonably expected
in a negotiation with civilized men, fully capable
of appreciating and protecting their own lights
For the Indian title of one hundred and sixteen
million three hundred and foity nine thousand
eight hundred and ninety seven acres acquired
since the 4th of March, 1829, the United fetales
have paid $72,560,0.%, m permanent annuities,
lands, reservations foi Indians, expenses of re
moval and subsistence, meieliandisc, mechanical
and agricultuial establishments, and implements
When the heavy expenses mcuned by t'te United
States, and the encumstance that so laige a por
tion of the entne teintoiy will be foicvei unsal-
able, aie consideied, and this price it. compared
with that for which the United Slates sell then
own lands, no one can doubt that justice has been
done to the Indians in these puichases also Cer-
tain it is that the transactions of the Federal Gov-
ernment with the Indians have been uniformly
characterized by a sinceie and paramount desiie
to promote then welfare, and it must be a souice
of the highest gratification to every fi lend to jus
tice and humanity to leain that, notwithstanding
the obstructions fiom time to time thrown m Us
way, and the difficulties which have arisen from
he pecuhai andimpiacticable nature of the Indian
chaiacter, the wise, humane, and undeviatmg
policy of the Government in tms, the most diífi- i
cult of all our lelations, foicign oi domestic, has
at length been justified lo the world in its near ,
approach to a happy and ceitdin consummation
The condition of the tribes which occupy the
country set apart foi them in the West is highly
prosperous, and encourages the hope of then caily
civilization They have,forthe most pait, aban-
doned the hunter state, and turned then attention
to agricultural pursuits \ II those who have been
established foi any length of time in that femle
region, maintain themselves by their own mdus-
tiy There an among them tiaders of no incon-
siderable capital, and plantéis exporting cotton to
some extent, but the greater numbei aie small
agriculturists, living in comfort upon the produce
of then (aims The íecent emigianls, although
Chey laye in some instances removed reluctantly,
have readily acquiesced m then unavoidable des
tiny. They have found at once aiccon pense for
past suffenngs, and an incentive to industttous
habits, in the abundance and comforts aiound
them There is leason to believe that all these
tubes aie faendly in then feelings towards the
United States, and it is to be hoped that 'he aoqm
sition of individual wealth, the pursuits of agu-
culture, and habits of mdustiy, will gradually
subdue their wailike pioptnsities, and incline
them to maintain peace among themselves To
effect this dtsirable object, the attention of Con-
gress is solicited to the measuics recommended
by the Secret try of War foi their future govern- !
mentand protection, as wed from each oihei as
fiom the hostility of the wailike tribes around
them, and the intrusion of the whites The policy ,
of the Government has given them a permanent
home, and guarantied to them us peaceful and I
undisturbed possession.   It only remains to give I
them a government and laws which will encourage
industry, and secure to them the rewards of their
exertions The importance of some form of gov-
ernment cannot be too much insisted upon The
earliest effects will be to dimmish the causes and
occasions for hostilities among the tribes, to in-
spire an interest in the observance of laws to
which they will have themselves assented, and to
multiply the securities of property, and the mo-
tives for self-improvement Intimately connected
with this subject is the establishment of the mil-
itary defenses recommended by the Secretary of
War, which have been already referred to. With-
out them, the Government will be powerless to
redeem its pledges of protection to the emigrating
Indians against the numerous warlike tribes that
surround them, and to provide for the safety of
the fiontier settlers of the bordering States.
The case of the Seminóles constitutes at pres-
ent the only exception to the successful efforts of
the Government to remove the Indians to the
homes assigned them west of the Mississippi.
Foui hundred of this tribe emigrated in 1836, and
fifteen hundied in 1837 and 1838, leaving in the
country, it is supposed, about two thousand In-
dians     The continued  treacherous conduct of
these people, the savage and unprovoked murdeis
they have lately committed, butchering whole
families of the settlers of the Territory, without
distinction of age oi s,ex, and making their way
into the veiy center and heart of the country, so
that no part of it is fiee from their ravages, then i
frequent attacks on the light houses along that j
dangerous coast, and the barbanty with which j
they have muidered the passengeis and ciewsof
such vesselsas have been wrecked upon the ¡eefs i
and K( ys which bolder the Gulf, leave the Gov- j
einmentno ikernativc but to c intinue tlu mili   [
taiy opeiations against them until they are totally
expilled from Florida
Flu if are othei motives which would uige the .
Government to pursu   this couise towards the '
Seminóles      The United Statts have fulfilled in
good fnth all then  tieaty stipulations with the
Indian tribes, and have, in cveij other instance,
insisted upon a like pertormanc  of then obliga-
tions     To lelctx from this salutary lule because
theStminolt s have in nntained tin msclves so long
in the terutoiy they had lelmquished, anl, in de
fiance of their frequent ixnd solemn engagements,
still continue to wage a íuthless war against the I
United States, wou'd not only evince a want of j
constancy on our part, but be of evil example m
our mteicouise with other  tribes     Experience I
has shown that but little is to be gained by the
maich of armies through a country so intersect- J
ed with inaccessible swamps and maishes, and I
which, fiom the fatal chaiactei of the climate,
must be abandoned at the end of the winter     I
recommend, thcretoio, to joui attention, the plan
submitted by the Secietaiy of Wai in the accom-
panying repoit, foi  the permanent occupation of i
thepoi tionof the terntoiy need fiom the Indians, '
and the more efficient protection of the pcopie of
Flondaftom then inhuman waifare                        ,
Fiom the lepoit of the Secietaiy of the Navy,
herewith transmitted, it will appear that a lar^e
poition of thedisposable nival foi ce lseitheract-
lvely employed, or in a state of pieparation foi
the purposes of f xperienceand discipline, and the
piotection ot our co nmerce So effectual has
been this protection, tint, so fir as the mfoima
Hon of Government extend-, not a single outiage
has been attempted on \ vessel cauying the fl ig
of the United States, within ihe pn sent year, in
any qu-n tei, howi vi i distant or exposed
The exploung expedition sai ed fiom ivoifolk
on tne 19th of August last, and mfoimation has
been leeelved of its safe arnval at the island of
Madeira The best spirit animates the ofiiceis
and ciews, ind there is every reason to antieipate
fiom ltstlfirts, results beneficial to commeiceand
honoiable to the nation
It will also  be seen that no leduction of the j
foice now in commission is contemplated     The ,
unsettled   state of a poiuon of South America I
lenders it indispensable that oin commerce should
receive piotection in that quarter, the vast and |
increasing inteiests embarked in the trade of the
Indian and China seas, in the whale fisheries of
the Pacific ocean, and in the Gulf of Mexico, re-
quire equal attention to their safety, and a small
squadron may be employed to great advantage on
our Atlantic coast, in meeting sudden demands 1
for the reinforcement of other stations, in aiding
merchant vessels in distress, in affording active
service to an additional number of officers, and m
visiting the different ports of the United States,
an accurate knowledge of which is obviously of
the highest importance
The attention of Congress is respectfully called
to that portion of the report recommending an in-
crease m the number of smaller vessels, and to
other suggestions contained in that document.
The rapid increase and wide expansion of our
commerce, which is every day seeking new ave-
nues of profitable adventure, the absolute neces-
sity of a naval force fonts protection precisely in
the degree of its extension, a due regard to the
national rights and honor, the recollection of its
former exploits, and the anticipation of its future
triumphs whenever opportunity presents itself,
which we may rightfully indulge from the expe-
rience of the past, all seem to point to the Navy
as a most efficient arm of our national defense
and a proper object of legislative encouragement.
The pi ogress and condition of the Post Office
Depaitment will be seen by reference to the re-
port of the Postmaster General The extent of
post roads, covered by mail contiacts, is stated
to be one hundred and thirty-four thousand eight
hundred and eighteen miles, and the annual trans-
portation upon them thirty-four millions five hun-
dred and eighty thousand two hundred and two
The numbei of post offices in the United States
is twelve thousand five hundied and fifty three,
and rapidly increasing The gross revenue for
the y< ar ending on the 30th da> of June last, was
$4,262.145 The accruing expenditures, if 4„680,-
068, excess of expendituies,$417,923 Thishas
been made up out of the surplus pioviously on
hand The cash on hand on the fust instant, was
#314,068 The revenue for the year ending June
30, 18,18, wis $161,540 moie than that for the
yeai ending June 30, 1837 The expenditures of
the Depaitment had been graduated upon the an-
ticipation of a largely nici eased revenue A mod-
élate cuitatlment ot mail service consequently
became necessary, and has been effected, to shield
the Department against the danger of embairass-
ment Its íevenue is now improving, and it will
soon icsume its onward course m the march of
improvement
Your particular attention is requested to so much
of the Postmaster General's leport as relates to
the transpoitation of the mails upon lailroads
The laws on that subject do not seem adequate to
secure that service, now become almost essential
to the public interests, and at the same time pio-
tect the Department fiom combinations and un-
reasonable demands
Nor can I too earnestly lequest your attention
to the necessity of pioviding a more secure build-
ing for this Department. The danger of destruc-
tion to which its important books and papers are
continually exposed, as well fiom the highly com-
bustible charactei of the building occupied as from
that of otheis in the vicinity, calls loudly for
prompt action
Your attention is again earnestly invited to the
suggestions and lecommendations submitted at
the last session in respect to the District of Co-
lumbia
1 feel it my duty, also, to bring to your notice
certain proceedings at law which have íecently
been prosecuted in this Distuct, in the name of
the United States, on the relation of Messrs
Stockton and Stokes, of the Slate of Maryland,
against the Postmaster General, and which have
resulted in the payment of money out of the na-
tional Treasury, for the fiist time since the estab-
lishment of the Government, by judicial compul-
sion exercised by the common law writ of man-
damus, issued by the cncuit couit of this District
The facta of the case, and the grounds of the
proceedings, will oe found fully stated m the re-
poit of the decision, and any additional informa-
tion which vou may desire will be supplied by
the propel Department. No interference m the
paiticular case is contemplated The money has
been paid, the claims of the prosecutors have been
satisfied, and the whole subject, so far as they
are concerned, is finally disposed of, but it is on
the supposition that the case may be regatded as
an authoritative exposition of the law as it now
stands that I have thought it necessary to present
it to your consideration
