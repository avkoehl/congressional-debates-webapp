HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, December 11, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,Commanding:

General Meady has just come in to report the result of an attempt to find out what troops are picketing on the left of the open space on the front about opposite Fort Gregg by exchange of a newspaper. It was well done by an intelligent young fellow, but failed completely. The paper was taken and some tobacco given in exchange, with the promise of a paper to-morrow, but the opposite picket would tell nothing as to his regiment. The prescribed garrisons and artillery are in all the rear forts, except Dushane and Davison, Gurely house. There is a battery of artillery and 200 men in Fort Dushane. Perhaps I had better add 200 men more. Shall I send any artillery to Fort Davison, Gurley house? There is some in reserve. The pickets on the rear and the commands in the rear works are cautioned to be on the alert.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 11, 1864-4.35 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have sent the household troops to Fort Davison, and I think it would be well to send a battery, a section of what you have in reserve. They can remain there during the emergency, and be withdrawn if wanted elsewhere. I don't think they need more to-night.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

General Macy has just sent me word that a deserter has come in, who states that he belongs to Rodes' division, which is on the enemy's right. The deserter is on the way here, and as soon as I see him I will send him up.
