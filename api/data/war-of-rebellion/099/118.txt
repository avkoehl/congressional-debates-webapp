HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Beaufort, S. C., January 23, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The Major-general commanding directs me to send you the inclosed copy of telegram from General Sherman to General Easton,* and to say that you will give orders to General Corse to move his division (entire) with the Left Wing of the Army, sending the remainder of your command to this point as rapidly as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. L. TAGGART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Beaufort, S. C., January 23, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Sherman says he cannot possibly spare the steamers from carrying supplies to Purysburg and Pocataligo, in order to transport General Corse's division. Please direct General Corse to move back over the route he came, between the Big and Little Ogeechee Rivers, keeping up as high as, or higher, than the Twenty-Mile Station. Perhaps it would be better to take General Blair's old route from Station Numbers 2 back to Guyton, or Numbers 3, and thence via Springfield to Sister's Ferry. He should proceed thence by some route parallel to Davis' line of march to Hickory Hill. At that point you will be able to unite your corps. This march General Corse can make easily in seven days, but he will have to be exceedingly careful of forage until he crossed the Savannah. If General Corse should happen to fall one or even two days in rear of your other divisions at Hickory Hill it will not matter.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S. - I do not make the order imperative as to the route, but rather suggestive.

O. O. H.,

Major-General.

Captain SAMUEL L. TAGGART,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department and Army of the Tennessee:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report my arrival at this point at 12 m. to-day. I left Savannah at 6 a.m. on the 19th instant, in compliance with orders from headquarters Fifteenth Army Corps (the Fourth Division and animals of Second Division were to follow). The road across Hutchinson's Island and the levees between the island and the Union Causeway, although badly cut up, were passable up to 12 m. of the 19th, when the rain and sudden rise of water made them impassable. I had gone forward to New River bridge, fourteen miles from Savannah, to see if it was in readiness to cross, but, finding it would
