Major-General McLAWS,

I have been cut off from Macon for thirty hours. It is reported to me that Macon will be evacuated by our troops, the enemy being too strong. I have, therefore, in council, decided to fall back to the Oconee, the now important point in this neighborhood. My force is 450, including sixty cavalry and four pieces of artillery. I report to you for orders.

HENRY C. WAYNE,

Major-General.
