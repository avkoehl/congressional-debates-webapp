Brigadier General HUMPHREY MARSHALL, via Bristol:

Lieutenant General K. Smith telegraphs me from Knoxville that General Baird left Nicholasville for Cumberland Gap with six regiments of infantry. The cavalry, under General Carter (1,500) after destroying bridges, were to co-operate on this side of the gap with Baird; that he (Smith) has about 2,000 effective men at the gap, and he wishes our cavalry to push Carter until he is driven across the mountain, and then wishes all my available troops to co-operate with the command at Cumberland Gap. I wish you to carry out the requests of General Smith, with the force under your command, as effectually as you can. Call on your quartermasters and commissaries for such transportation and supplies as you need. All that the department can supply is at your service. Communicate to me what you have done, and are doing. Bragg defeated Rosecrans on the 31st, and was in pursuit of him on the 1st.

Keep me informed of the latest new you have from Bragg's army; if he has defeated Rosecrans completely. I ought to have some information [of] the enemy's movements on Cumberland gap.
