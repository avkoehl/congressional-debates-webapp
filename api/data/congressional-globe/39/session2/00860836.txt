Mr. DAWES. Does the gentleman propose
to put the bill upon its passage to-day without
its being printed?
Mr. JENCKES. It has been printed two or
three times and is upon the files of members.
Mr. DAWES. We want to know if the gen-
tleman has kept it in the same shape in which
it was first printed. -
Mr. JENCKES. I do not wish to interfere
with the morning hour. If the Committee on
Military Affairs are desirous of reporting to-
day, and if, by unanimous consent, this bill
can be taken up after the morning hour I will
yield for that purpose.
Mr. KASSON. I desire to go into Com-
mittee of the Whole on a regular appropriation
bill after the morning hour.
Mr. DAWES. I suggest to the gentleman
that nobody will object to his recommitting his
bill and entering a motion to reconsider.
Mr. JENCKES. If I am entitled to the
floor now, unless I can yield it by unanimous
consent and resume it after the expiration of
the morning hour I prefer to proceed, as this
is a very important measure not second to any
now before Congress.
Mr. DAWES. I hope the gentleman will
submit the proposition to the House and see
if there will be objection to his recommitting
his bill and entering a motion to reconsider.
Mr. ALLISON. I object to that proposi-
tion.
Mr. JENCKES. _ If this bill is to be pre-
sented at all for action, it is full late to present
it now ; and as my proposition for postpone-
ment is objected to, I prefer to proceed now.
Mr. DAWES. Will the gentleman yield to
me to make a report from the Committee on
Elections upon a question of privilege?
Mr. JENCKES. I will yield willingly if I
do not by that means lose my right to the floor.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman can yield
for a question of privilege without losing his
right to resume the floor when the question of
privilege shall have been disposed of.
Mr. JENCKES. Then I will yield.
ELECTIONS IN MARYLAND.
Mr. DAWES. The Committee of Elections,
who were instructed by a resolution of the House
of the 21st instant to enter into a certain invest-
igation, have directed me to make a report,
and with the indulgence of the House for a few
moments I will submit the views of the com-
mittee. The resolution, with its preamble, is
as follows:
Whereas by the constitution and laws of the State
of Maryland persons who were disloyal to the Gov-
ernment of the United States, or save aid and encour-
agement to the recent rebellion are deprived of the
elective franchise; ami whereas it is alleged that at
the last election in the State of Maryland lar^e num-
bers of the persons disqualified as aforesaid did vote
for Representative in the Fortieth Congress and
other officers; and whereas it is further alleged '.hat
"armed forces of the United States were ordered by
Federal authority to, and did, cooperate with the
Executive of tho State of Maryland and others who
were engaged with him in overriding the constitution
and laws aforesaid, and in securing the votes of rebels
and persons disqualified as aforesaid, and whereby
loyal and qualified voters of Maryland were deterred
from the free exercise of the elective franchise and
from resisting and preventing the violation of the
constitution and laws aforesaid: Therefore,
Mesolved. Ihat the Committee of Elections shall
inquire into and report whether the constitution and
laws have been violated as aforesaid, and whether
the President or any one under his command has m
any manner interfered with the said election, or has
in any way used or threatened to use the military
power of the nation with reference to the said elec-
tion, and if so, whether it was upon the requisition
of the Governor of Maryland; and the commitee
shall have power to send for persons and papers.
The House will observe that the only matter
embraced in this proposed inquiry over which
this Congress can possibly have ,jQrisdiction
is the conduct of the President in reference
thereto. The Committee of Elections were of
opinion that inasmuch as the House had deemed
it proper to instruct the Committee on the Ju-
diciary to inquire into the official conduct of the
President of the United States, it would serve
only to distract and dissipate the investigation
of that matter to instruct another committee to
pursue the same inquiry. Therefore the Com-
mittee of Elections have instructed me to report
back this resolution, ask that the Committee
of Elections be discharged from its further
consideration, and that the same be referred to
the Committee oil the Judiciary : and on that
I call the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the motion of Mr. Dawes was
agreed to.
Mr. DAWES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the motion was agreed to ; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
Mr. FERRY, by unanimous* consent, pre-
sented communications from the Governor and
adjutant general of the State of Michigan, in
relation to the militia bills now pending before
the Committee on the Militia of the House of
Representatives; which were referred to the
Committee on the Militia, and ordered to be
printed.
BOUNTIES AND LOST DISCHARGES.
Mr. SCHENCK. With the permission of
the gentleman from Rhode Island, [Mr.
Jenckes,] I desire to remind the House that
while waiting for some disposition to be made
of the bill in charge of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Stevens,] and which yes-
terday was referred to the Committee on Re-
construction, I gave notice that as soon as
that bill was disposed of I would, having leave
to report at any time, report from the Military
Committee the bill in relation to bounties and
lost discharges. My friend from Rhode Island
[Mr. Jexckes] has anticipated me by report-
ing another bill, one in relation to the civil
service of the United States, with which Iliave
no disposition to interfere, because I recognize
its importance. But I desire very muchjx>
report the bill to which I have referred; and
I would inquire of the Speaker whether I can
now, the floor being yielded to me for that
purpose, report this bill, and let it coine up
the next thing after the bill introduced by the
gentleman from Rhode Island [Mr. Jexckes]
shall have been disposed of.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio,
[Mr. Schencic, ] with the consent of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island, [Mr. Jejtckes,] can
report the bill to which he refers, and it will
come up after the morning hour, whenever there
is a morning hour. The House granted per-
mission for the bill to be reported at anytime
upon giving one day's notice, the bill to be con-
sidered after the morning hour.
Mr. SCHENCK. I now report back from
the Committee on Military Affairs House bill
No. 83G, to equalize the bounties of soldiers,
sailors, and marines, who served in the late
