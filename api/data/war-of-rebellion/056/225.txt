CUMBERLAND GAP, November 22, 1863-2 p.m.

Captain W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following information just received: A reliable officer, Lieutenant Stanley, adjutant Twelfth Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry, who left Strawberry Plains on the 20th instant, brings hopeful news of the position in Knoxville. General Burnside still holds out, and had notified the citizens of Knoxville that he would hold the place. The rebel force opposing him is estimated by scouts who have been through the lines several times to be 36,000. The place is not closely invested. Brigadier-General Sanders was wounded, and has since died. Wolford is slightly wounded. The artillery fighting was very heavy on the 19th and 20th. The enemy admits heavy loss. They have withdrawn their force from south side of the river. We forage there.

Brigadier-General.

Major-General GRANT:

Firing was heard all day yesterday at Knoxville. No rebel troops had passed down through Morristown or Bean's Station up to noon yesterday,and none heard of advancing that way. Williams' force must therefore be still above me.
