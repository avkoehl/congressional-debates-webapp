Major General D. H. HILL,

Commanding at Petersburg, Va.

I reconnoitered Cobb's to-day; saw officer and troops there. Will order Johnson to capture some prisoners to-night, or make a forced reconnaissance to-morrow morning at daylight. Have authorized General Dearing to make expedition against enemy's transports.

Major-General HILL:

GENERAL: All quiet in our front. The enemy burned two houses in front of the center of Brigadier-General Ransom's brigade late last evening. The woods caught fire from the houses, which came near to our picket-lines.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. O. WATTS,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

The work is still going on under the direction of Major Bryan and Lieutenant Postell, Engineer Corps.

(Received 9.40 p. m.)

General B. BRAGG:

The following just received from Kinston:

Enemy's cavalry, 700 strong, were just below Trenton to-day at 12 o'clock. Scouts could not ascertain whether they were moving on railroad to Kinston or would take the Duplin road. Could not learn whether they had any infantry; two pieces of artillery were seen. Scouts from New Berne informed me just before this information reached me, that an expedition was on foot to destroy the gun-boat. Can you spare me troops? I think they are coming here.

G. N. FOLK,

Colonel, Commanding.

J. H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to the Adjutant and Inspector General.

I know of no troops except the reserves. This application should have been made to General Beauregard, commanding the department.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
