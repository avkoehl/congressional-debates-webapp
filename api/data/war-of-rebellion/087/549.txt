Third Division, commanded by General Ferrero, to connect on the right of the First Division, and to push forward and see what was in their front. This division advanced through a heavy growth of timber and underbrush to within 100 yards of the enemy's line of works, when their progress was arrested by slashed timber and abatis. I next took measures to form a connected line from our old works to our advanced position, and ordered the Second Division, under General Potter, to connect with the Third Division, and to prolong its line until its right should touch our old intrenched position and cover the ground between sand our old camp. My whole line being thus established, I gave orders that it should be intrenched, which was thoroughly done by the morning of the 28th. About 7 a. m. of the 28th. About 7 a. m. of the 28th I received orders to prepare to withdraw, in conjunction with the Fifth movement was commenced about 1 p. m. and was conducted with but slight interference form the enemy. General Willcox' division I ordered to bring up the rear, and this fell back in line of battle, gradually relieving the Third Division as it came in its rear. About one mile from our old works I ordered General Potter, commanding Second Division, to form in line of battle and to allow the First and Third Division to pass through. Our movement was successfully accomplished, and by 6 a. [p.] m. of the 28th I had all my command in its old position and my picket-line re-established.

I inclose copies of the reports of my division commanders, to which I refer you for further particulars.

A tabular report of casualties I have already sent in.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
