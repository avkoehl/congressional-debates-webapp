going to Vicksburg. No force at Raymond. My advance is now up with the rear guard of their cavalry. Citizens of Clinton inform me that they passed through there in double-quick and that they seemed to be very much frightened.

Reports of Brigadier General William H. Jackson, C. S. Army.

BROWNSVILLE, AND CLINTON ROAD, Six Miles from Brownsville, October 16, 1863-2 p. m.

GENERAL: Have been skirmishing with enemy's infantry all the morning. They have driven me 2 miles. I have now a strong position. Their cavalry, I have just learned from inclosed note, have gone in direction of Yazoo City. I have sent Logan's brigade in pursuit of that party. He crosses at Scott's Ferry. Enemy's force reported one division of infantry and one brigade of cavalry last night. I am inclined to think this move in my front is intended to conceal the movement toward Yazoo City and railroad. I think it would be well for you to guard the most important bridges. I wish that you had your brigade out here now. I will keep you advised.

Very respectfully,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.
