STRAWBERRY PLAINS, February 29, 1864

General GRANGER,

Loudon:

I cannot communicate with General Schofield at once; he is at the front. It is very important that a regiment and section of artillery should be sent to Hiwassee bridge to relieve the force now there, which General Thomas needs.

EDWARD E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff.

STRAWBERRY PLAINS, February 29, 1864.

Major-General GRANGER:

The commanding general directs that your order a regiment of infantry with a section of artillery to proceed to Hiwassee to relieve the force now guarding the railroad bridge over that river.

By command of Major-General Schofield:

EDWARD E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, February 29, 1864

Major-General THOMAS:

I have not heard from Schofield since the 26th. He was directed to relieve Granger as soon as it was known that Longstreet had gone beyond striking distance. Telegraph Schofield what orders to give Granger when relieved. McCook's cavalry I expect is now far up the Holston.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, February 29, 1864

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Chattanooga:

What is to prevent the troops commencing immediately the work of reconstruction on the railroad from Chattanooga toward Dalton? The Tenth Illinois veterans are now here on their way to the front. There has always been difficulty between this regiment and General Morgan since his promotion out of it. The good of the public service will be subserved by attaching this regiment to some other division than the one to which it now belongs.

General Morgan I always regarded as a superior officer whilst he was with me, but after an officer's promotion from a regiment it has been my policy to separate his command from that regiment. Upon promotions being made after the fall of Fort Donelson I adopted this rule and believe it is a good one. In the present case I know it will relieve feelings that have existed for more than a year.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
