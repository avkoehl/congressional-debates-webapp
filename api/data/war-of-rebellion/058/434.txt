NASHVILLE, February 20, 1864.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

General Thomas was expected to move toward Dalton one week ago on Monday last at farthest. Rains prevented him. He will certainly move to-morrow.

Bear this in mind in the influence it will have on the enemy. Watch him closely, and if you can take any advantage of his movements do it. I do not think Longstreet should be allowed to quietly withdraw from Knoxville, nor to come up and invest the place without opposition. Cause him all the annoyance you can, either by demonstration or actual attack.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, February 20, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Can you spare a pontoon bridge from Chattanooga to throw across the river at Decatur? If not, what objection to sending your arsenal bridge train from here to Decatur? If required at Chattanooga afterwards they can be towed up by our steamers or transported by rail as conveniently as from here. Answer.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, February 20, 1864.

Major-General GRANT:

I have no bridge here that I can spare at this time. The one you allude to can be spared for a short time. Please order it to be sent here as soon as it can be dispensed with.

GEO. H. THOMAS,Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, Tenn., February 20, 1864.

Colonel ELI LONG,

Commanding, Calhoun:

A reconnaissance in force is to be made from this point in the direction of Dalton on Monday morning next. Cannot you send a cavalry force out upon the Spring Place road to observe the enemy's movements
