HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE WEST,Iuka, Miss., September 19, 1862.

Major-General VAN DORN, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your couriers have both arrival, bringing your dispatches of the 16th instant.

I will move my army as quickly as I can in the direction proposed by you. I am, however, expecting an attack to-day, as it seems, from the most reliable information which I can procure, that they are concentrating their forces against me. Ross' division is said to have gotten here yesterday from Bolivar. General Ord, commanding the left wing of Grant's army, is in front of me. A demonstration by you upon Rienzi would greatly facilitate the execution of the movement which you suggest. I have ordered a cavalry regiment to keep our line of communication open. It left yesterday for Baldwyn.

I am, &c.,

STERLING PRICE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE WEST,Iuka, Miss., September 19, 1862.

Brigadier-General LITTLE:

GENERAL: The enemy are driving in our pickets upon the Iuka and Bay Springs road, the one by which the army approached Iuka. You will please order Brigadier-General Hebert to move forthwith upon that road with his brigade and to prevent their further advance. General Armstrong will detail two or three squadrons of cavalry to report to him. The order is inclosed.

I am, &c.,

THOS. L. SNEAD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
