the hands, and not allow small bands of robbers to drive off ten times their number of able-bodied men. This has been suggested to them but up this time I believe they have not deemed best to do it. It is evident that we cannot furnish troops to protect every workman on the road, strung along as they are for eighty miles, from strolling gangs of one or more robbers. I am confident that no other officer, under the circumstances, would have placed the large force in that part of the State that I have, when the calls upon me for troops are so urgent from other equally important points.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Governor FLETCHER,

Jefferson City:

I have thrown all the cavalry and infantry in North Missouri into the Central District. I now have twice as many troops in that sub-district as in any other. The citizen companies should organize and the railroad companies should arm their hands. All of Harding's Regiment is there. I have also sent two companies of cavalry from Fort Scott. Harding's headquarters are now at Lexington. General Fisk says the Regiment at Saint Joseph is not yet organized or fully officered. Will move in down as soon as possible. Please officer it.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
