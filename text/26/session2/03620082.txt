thereby settle definitively the multifarious and per-
plexing questions of controversy concerning them
which present themselves, and occupy our time and
attention, at each successive session of Congress.
I am aware that the discussion now belongs,
more especially, to the two proportions of the Sena-
tors from Ken'ucky and from Sooth Carolina;
thej have, however, intimate connection with the
original bill; and before I proceed farther, I must
submit a few remarks in reply to some of the ob-
jections which have been urged by i s opponents
The quarter from which this opposition comes,
Mr. President, may well exede the surprise of
some, and is not entirely unworihy of notice It is
from the opponents of this Admmmra i n, and the
friends of that whuh is srnrtly to take us place
Although in my opening rcnail s, it will be recol-
lected, I ex'ended to thov g ndeaien the courtesy
of supposing theymttrded tocurycut Ihurlate
professions in practice, I must confess my faith in
the sincerity of those prof «ions, d> well as in
many others made by 'h m in the late canva«s,
was not very r n ng I ha 1 too often w itnessed

humble inhabitants of log cabins, every where,
that lhe candidate of the Opposition and his sup-
porters, were their peculiar friends? To say
otherwise, would seem to m  to be barefaced
mockery—nay, sir, the violent opposition which
this bill has encountered, and that whi"h it is now
but too obvious the graduation bill and a'l kindred
measures are destined to encounter from those
same gentlemen, proves incontestably that all those
exhibi'ionsof kind feeling and generous sympathy
were but a cruel mock«ry '
Sir, as I remarked on a former occasion, 'his bul
is free from the objection of par'iality which has al
waysbeen urged against those here oforepasse-l, it is
no longer confined to the citizens of the new States,
nor to those already on the land The pre-emp-
tion bill, now before us, opens the door to every
individual of the old as well as the ne v State?, and
enables htm to obtain a freehold an 1 a home To
former pre emption bills our opponents raised the
objection of partiality, to this ihey raise the objec-
tion of its too great universale' if is ¿low too broad,
and admits too many to the enjoyment of its pnvi
leges.
Do you believe, Mp. President, it would be pos-
sible co to frame a bill as to obvi ne the d ffcultiss
of such objectors? No, sir, as fast ss we remove
one ground of objection, another ij taken They
comp'atned that former bills were too nanao, we
e-ctend'd the prousions of thic, and now, forsooih,
it is loo wide' Sir, were I to indulge a conj cture
1 shou'd say thnt no b !', narrower wide, won' 1
suit the palates of these fastidious g nileiien, so
long as it c mtained the pre-r-np ive ka'nre, ex
tending tne protecting shield over the humble culti-
vator of the soil ¿gainst the power of lh- h art'eis
speculator, and parcelling out fte pub ic domain,
in small tr?cis, to those who will improve and ren-
der it productive, instead of s°lung n m laigi bo-
dies to the nch monopolist, who will suffer it to lie
waste and unprofitable till the necessities of the cul-
tivator compel him to give the desired profit.
Mr- Pre" dent, the Senator from Kentucky far-
thest from me [Mr. Clai] on tin  occasion, as
heretofore, heads and leads on the opposing host
However versatile he may have proved himself on
o her great question', of which some prominent
instances mie;ht be given, he still remiins, as he
has always heretofore been, the immovable and in-
flexible opponent of this an! all othei measure  of
liberality to the people of the new States That
Senator has thought proper to reler to the incidents
of last year, to which I have just alluded, and
while, m one breath, he thinks proper to call us,
who have uniformly supported former pre-emption
and graduation bi'ls, "new converts" to log cib n
principle , in lh" next, he t„unts us wi'h
having failed, b/ our friendship, to conciliate
and secure the votes of moie thin fom out
of the nine new Stiles He cilled tho,e mea-
sure? "land traps to citch vote ," a d ex-
ulted that they had failed to accomplish the de-
sired object Sir, if they did fail, in th" *nse inti-
mated by the Senator, thev may have bad some
influence m the Western States, as Abobt on bad
in other quarters m deciding, at Hamsbuig, last
winter, who should be the standaid bearer of the
Ftderal par'y. And, *ir, this same Federal p^rty

General Harnson'  supposed popularity, by repre
sentmg him a  ' an older and better so'ditr" in the
cause of the pioneers of the West than the pres nt
incumbent L°t not that fnnorab'e Sonsfoi sup-
pose for a iromeit—let him not "lay th  flittering
unction to his soul"-~that he w 11 ever live to see
the day when Ihe honest, m tlbp nt, and hijh-
«oiilcd people of the West, will forset the wronss
they have buffered, in connection with this subject,
and reward tho e with their confidence by whom
they have been inflicted No, sir if the chivalrous
sons ot that region are to be conciliated, it trust
be by honorable atonement, not by continued and
persevering hostility.
Mr President, I cannot pass by, altogether un-
noticed, another topic, introduced by the Senator
from Kentucky, [Mr Clat,] though, to my nmd,
without any very natural arnnity to the subject un-
der consideration After denouncing the original
bill as "a fearful extension of the pre-emption sys-

Senate.
tern"—as "an untried and most hazardous expert"
ment," he appealed to ihe Administration Sena-
tors not to introduce pnd pass new and important
measures, "just as a dismissed minis ry were going
out." How magnanimous' and how meekly he
wefsrs his blushing honors' Bat the Senator must
have forgotten, at the moment, that Congress passes
law , and not any ministry, which may be going
out or coming in. He must have forgotten, too,
fiat his illustrious ' military chieftain" holds the
doctrine that the Executive is not a branch of the
law making power, and that he has said, in effect,
that he would veto no law which might be passed
by a majority of Congress, and be desired by a ma-
jority ot the penóle
Sir, the Sena'or fro n Kentucky [Mr Clay] has
followed this up, by furnishing another disclosure
of the difference in 'he corduct of aspirants, before
and after elections—another discrepancy between
promises and performance We all recollect the
denunciations a:am I the present Adm nistration
for its alleged ''pioscnpiiins fot opinion's sake."
The Opposition assuni'd, as one of i's various par-
ty cognomens, that of the "anti p-osenpuon party"
—no man was *o b  rem led from office for a
mere difference of pobtical opinion. Yet, «ir.what
dies the Senator—who speaks a% one having au-
thority—what does the Semtor now tell us on this
s-ubjec? In aUusfoi lo the appointments which
have feeen] or may be made by the preset Chief
Magistrate, he ^ ery clearly intimates, they are not
to be much in the way of hr successor. He tells
us significant y and emphatically, thit "General
Ilanison means to bePiesilentou the 4th of March
next" He «ys 'General Harrison, wnen he comes,
will look at tho>e whom h  finds in office, and, if
be (indi thit tbey ¡re honest and capable and faith-
ful, that they have rot b en noisy andforwaid po-
litic ars, nor brought the i effical influence in con-
fi c wuh the freedom of elections, if any such
there be"—(at Ihe «ame time making an emphatic
pause and shaking his head most incredulously,
and satisfying all who heard and saw him that he
meant to be understood that he believed there
would be none such) "he hopes he will let
them stand (though he feared there would be
but few) as monuc en's of the liberality of a
Whig Administration, acting on patriotic princi-
ples." Such, the Senator tells us, are the chañes of
Democrats, who may be found m office, to remain
as monuments of Whig magnanimity and forbear-
ance ' The Sena'or evidently mews to be under-
stood that there will benon* s'ich, and I submit the
question, whether a single one—whatever may
have been his cipac y, his purity, hi« fidelity, or
his discretion—will be able to p^ss the ordeal which
awaits him or run t'ie g?untlet unscathed, amongst
the thousands and tens of thousands of hungry ex-
pectants and greedy office seekers, who are said to
hive already visited North Bend in pursuit of the
spiib, and who will sbor'ly infest every avenue
leading to the Presidential mansion in greatly aug-
raen'ed numbers? Why, s r, before I left my r"s -
dence, I heard the name  of some twelve indivi-
dual mentioned, a« a?p ran's to the office of post-
master cf a town confining a population of only
some 3 000 ouls—yet, I never heard tre fiist im-
putation against the; capacity, integrity, or fidelity
of the incumbent And so it is,sir, Ihroughoutthe
country there is scarcely an rib"e of the most
hnmb'e grade, he'd by a Democrat, for which there
are no' many applicants to be found m the ranks of
this office-bating, and spoils party I have seen it
stated that but a few days ago, the Legislature of a
neighboring State, in wh ch the> Whigs have recent-
ly obta nid the as-cendeMw, turned out indiscrimi-
nately every Democrat, even down to the men who
swept the flwrs of tbe Cspitol Such, sir, are the
evidences of Whig sincerity, and such will be the
monuments of Whig magnanimity'
Another topic (said Mr C ) has been brought
into this discussion, and djelt upon at some lenaih
by several Senators who are opposed to the bill,
which has no sort of connection with the subject.
I allude, sir, to that of the naturalization of fo-
reigners, and whether a State is competent to ex-
tend the r ght of suffrage to a foreigner, not natu-
ralized. As it is a question not involved in the bills
nor in any other proposition under consideration, I
