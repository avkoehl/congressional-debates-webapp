FORT MONROE, VA., August 1, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES,

Commanding Military District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be very much as on Wednesday last. He has at times febrile symptoms which decrease and augment from time to time. He complains of a tendency to vertigo on rising from his bed in the morning, which passes away in the course of half an hour. He complains, too, of a severe pain in the small of the back accompanied with a grating sensation on moving. This grating sensation, too, he experiences at the base of the skull. His appetite is about as usual, and I see no increase or diminution of muscular strength.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
