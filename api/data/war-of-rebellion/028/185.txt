off their ammunition, passed here en route to Frederick. They report that pickets of an Ohio regiment at the ferry retreated without firing a gun. The river is easily fordable at that point. I can see about 2,000 of the enemy upon this side, scattered along from the aqueduct no Noland's Ferry; judge they are cavalry. Can see two guns in position upon opposite side of the river. Cannot discover the enemy in force at that point, nor near Leesburg, though such reports are current.

General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Just arrived, having explored the river road thoroughly. It is picketed some 4 miles out with infantry, and no attempt will be made to cross below Seneca. The main part of my force and a battery came to this place by the way of Rockville. I could not find Buford's cavalry at Chair Bridge. The Massachusetts regiment is now picketing all the fords. Longstreet crossed over last night with cavalry, and attacked the First Massachusetts Cavalry (one company) at Monocacy Ford. They attempted to make a bridge, to cross artillery, but gave it up. From what I see of this country, I do not think they will cross the Potomac in large force below Harper's Ferry. The Massachusetts regiment report 4 or 5 killed and some 10 or 15 prisoners. Longstreet has returned to the other side, and the enemy has been shelling Edwards Ferry to-day. Colonel Carter, Third Indiana Cavalry, has reported with a battery. I shall send, for the present, one squadron to Poolesville, to examine and report affairs there.

General R. B. MARCY:

My pickets at Poolesville report 3,000 infantry on that side of the river, and that the enemy seems to be massing his troops in the vicinity of Ball's Bluff and Edwards Ferry, where he thinks they will cross. They have taken two or three canal-boats and have blown up the aqueduct.

General R. B. MARCY:

Banks' corps has not made its appearance to-day. I suppose it had taken the river road, which is a very long one. Should it take post at Darnestown, I can open the communication to Rockville, but I do not think the corps can maintain itself at Darnestown, One of Banks' staff officers told me to-day that his corps is not over 5,000 strong.
