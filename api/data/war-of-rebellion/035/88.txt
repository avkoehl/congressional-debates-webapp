movement of this army when ready, because his paymasters are inexperienced, and cases of refusal to pay arising therefrom are so frequent that, without his presence, payments would be very greatly obstructed; besides, nearly half his corps are sick. The only paymaster he could leave in charge is among the sick. I have ordered the major not to leave until the orders of the General-in-Chief on the subject can be known. If the general could only have this paymaster business regulated more in accordance with the interests of the service, it would be a great thing.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

I left Lexington last night. All quiet in that vicinity, a mounted force of about 1,500 men being on the heels of the rebels at Mount Sterling, their force not exceeding 700. Have just received dispatch from Gillmore that rebels are advancing in force on Richmond road. Don't credit the report fully, but there may be something in it. Shall make the best disposition possible of my small force, which may be sufficient; but if it is not, you must supply any troops you can spare.

The enemy are advancing in force toward the Kentucky River, through Richmond, said to be commanded by Breckinridge and Pegram. Colonel Minner has fallen back to the Kentucky River, toward Nicholasville. Firing was heard on the Tait's Creek road, south of the river, this morning. Enemy reported to be advancing through Mount Vernon, to intercept Miner, and I have ordered Colonel Gilbert to get ready to fall back to Hickman Bridge with his sick and stores. Can you send me any more men? The five companies you have sent to Cynthiana I have ordered here, and have also ordered the balance at Frankfort here. I
