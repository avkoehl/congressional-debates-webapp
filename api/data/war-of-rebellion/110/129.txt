he was by your Department referred, I have consented for him to go to Virginia for the purpose of adjusting them. He is all ready for the field, with the exception of arms, and has a fine regiment under his command. He entertains the hope, too, that he might be able to find arms enough for his regiment among those taken at Manassas. If they could be spared, it would be of great consequence to us, as we are wanting his regiment immediately. In my late communications I urged the increase of my force for operations in Missouri and to strengthen our position on the rivers and the frontier of Kentucky. I am satisfied there is to be a strong movement made to overrun Missouri, as all indications testify. He is reported to have concentrated at Cairo 20,000 men and a considerable force at Girardeau. I can get the force I want around me with the necessary authority, and I will arms them with the arms of the country until our own armories I am now inaugurating turn out arms. I beg to press upon the Department the indispensable necessity of increasing our force. To place the arming of the force here and in the commands drawing their supplies from us on a proper footing, we must have an ordnance force. I beg leave to submit to the Department and to urge upon its adoption the ordnance organization of the Army of Tennessee as it stands, with his exception, that M. H. Wright should be placed at its head with the rank he now of captain, and the other officers transferred as they stand. This is of great importance to the efficiency of that department with us here. The parties who compose it are all highly intelligent and active, and I know not how, with the armies of Tennessee and Arkansas, and now occasionally Missouri and perhaps Kentucky, drawing upon us, we can keep up our supplies. We shall be able to get all the lead we want from Arkansas, and will in a few days more have two powder factories going near Memphis with large capacity of production. Our cap factory will in a few days turn out over day. We are also collecting and adopting arms, but not as rapidly as we might if our powers were enlarged.

I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

LEONIDAS POLK,
