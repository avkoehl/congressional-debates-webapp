Ard gentlemen had taken on thenstlves the re
tmnsibility   ct   makug   a   departuie   from   ■'-
r«les as thty s ood Why did they not orga-
n ¿e the K -use under the rules of the last Con-
g tssi They bad tne majority, and they could
hdve dore it—an I the , ard they alone, were
responsible to ihe country for the state of things
w-icli now existed The gentleman from
Virg a a uow asked the Hon e to cosne up to the
previous qaesiiun alter his fuend had forced it into
us pres< n ituation Was it right that the previous
qu s'ion should be su'tamed tinder such circum-
s'ances' If tne Hous  should lefuse to sustain it,
hen the resolution wou <1 be open to t,uch amend-
ment as might be feasible One of these was to
resol/e toat tne p oceedngs rf the House should
be governed by ihe parliamentary Jaw instead of
a system of writ en rules H s hfe on if, a mea-
sare like that would redeem the House from the
miserable confusion which had prevailed Mr P.
snould vo'" aganut he previous question, beeause
h'   pre'erred
parliamentary   iaw  of   Great
Bri'ain H^ had no wish to thwart the orgamza-
*ion of th  House, but under the circumstances
w n Ji bad been thrust upon him by ne gentleman
'rom Massachusetts and his associates, he dare not
iccede it v.oulJ ce treason in him to do so, and
as o the impaction «rich nad beea cast upoa
him, he tbre ' u back witn 'corn
Mr. HA8ER8HAM of Geoigia said that he was
opposed .0 the prev ous question, but m s'ating the
reastns of that opposition he did not pfopose to
occupy the time ot the House, and were he even
nu med to do so, h s strength was not such as to
admi 0 it HJ h d now beenm Congress during
thripse=sitn He had been an attentive hslener
to a 1 ne dt.batei wh c\ dunn  that period, had
ocurredon the Abjlit ou qu stion, but had never
befure e i>>ed an oppo 'unit) of offering a few
worlsn explanation or tne opinions and views he
enie'ttned micgaid to it Ard hou d he, in the
eourso ot t e bnet re^narus h  was now about to
mate, nrdverten ly deviate from the direct ques-
tion beio e th H u e, he hope i they tsould treat
him t Uh indts, e! ce
Mr. H w¿-> opposed to th" prev ous question
ma n y b cause i e preferred the resolution which
had been read by the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia over the way [iVfr C Brown] to that which
n?d been moved by the gentle «an from Virginia
[Mr SraART ] Tne former re obition was m en-

and had aiijs he'd, in reference to the course
proper to be pursued   with lh°se Aboltt on peti-
