Major-General McCOOK,Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

Your dispatch of 1.30 is received. The general commanding directs you to move Generals Negley and Sheridan this way. Send a brigade to relieve Crittenden, and hold Gordon's Mills. Perhaps Sheridan may be spared to move up that way and be ready for emergencies. Send the forces that you are to spare to General Thomas at once.

Very respectfully,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

The tide of battle sweeps to the right. The general commanding thinks you can now move the two brigades of Sheridan to this place. Leave the one brigade posted at Gordon's Mills, to be used there or this way, as circumstances may require. If the right is secure, some forward and directed your forces now fighting.
