Indian Hostilities—Mr. Benton.

only fault of our officers is, that they did not hang

Arbuthnot and Ambristef tt as due to him a thou-
sand times over
i have now answered {he accusation of the
Senator from New Je^ey, [Mr. Southard] I
have shown the origin of this war Í have shown
that it originated in no fraud, no injustice, no vio-
lence, on the part of this Government, but m the
'hirst for blood and rapine on the part of these In-
dians, and in their confident belief that their
swamps would be their protection against th  pur-
part of the whiter and that, emerging from thee
fostni"sses to commit robbery and murde , and
retiring to them to enjoy the ffmls of their ma-
rauding expeditions, they had before them a long
perspective of impumtv in the enjoyment o1" their
favorite occupation This I have shown to be the
cause of the wai, and having vindicated the Admi-
nistration and the country from the injustice of the
imputation fast upon them, I proceed to answer
some things said by a Senator from South Caro-
lina, [Mr Presión,] which tended to disparage
the (roops generally which have been employed in
Florida, to disparage a particular generil officer,
 nJ also to accuse that general ofhepr of a pirticu-
iar and specified offence That Senator has decried
our troops in Florida fo? the general inefficiency of
th?ir operations, he has decned General Jesup for
the general imbecililv of his operations, and he has
charged this Geneial with the violation of a flag,
and the eomm ssion of a perfidious act, in detaining
and imprisoning the Indian Powell who came into
his ramp Í think there is great error and great
injustice m all these imputations, and mat it is
right foi some Senator on this floor to a iswe"
them My position, as chairman of the Commit-
tee on Military Affiirs, would «cm to a sign thit
duty to me, and it niaj be the reason why oihers w ho
have sptíken have omitted all reply on these points
Be that as it may, I feel impelled to say some-
thing in behalf oí those who are absent, and cannot
speak for themselves—those who must always feel
the wound of unmerited censure, and must feel it
more keenly when the blow that inflicts the wound
falls from the elevated theatre of the American
Senat  So far as the army, generallj, is con-
cerned in this censure, I might leave them where
they have been placed by tne Senator from South
Carolina, and others on that side of the House, if I
could limit myself to acting a pMitical part here
The army, as a body, is no friend of the political
parly to which I belong Individuals among
them are friendly to the Administration, but, as a
body, they go for the Oppo  uon, and would
terminate our political existence, and put our
opponents m our place, at (he first general
election that jn ervenes As a poli ician, then,
I might abandon them to the care of their political
friends, but, as an American, as a Senator, and as
having had some connection wi h the military pro-
fession, 1 feel myself ca'led upon to dissent from
the opinion which has been expressed, -md to gwe
my reasons for believing that the army has not
suffered, er ought not to suffer, by the events m
Florida True, our officers and soldiers have not
performed the same feats there which they performed
in Canada, and elsew here Bgt why' Certa nly be-
cause they have not got the same or an equiva-
lent, theatre to act upon, nor an enemy to cope
with over whom hiílliant victories can be obtain-
ed The peninsula of Florida, where this war
rages, is sprinkled all over with suampo, ham-
mocks, and lagoons, believed for three hundred
years to be impervious to the white man's tread
The theatre of war is of great extent, stretching
over six parallels of latitude, all of >t in the sultry
reg'on below thirty-one degrees of north latitude
The extremity of this peninsula approaches the
iropicof capncoin, and at this moment, while we
speak here, the soldier under arms at midday there
will cast no shadow a \ertical sun darts its fiery
ravs direct upon the erown ot his head Suffo-
cating heat oppresses the fraore, annoying insects
sting the bodj, burning sands, a spongy morass,
and the sharp cutting saw grass, receive the feet
and legs, disease follows the summers etertion,
and a dense foliage covers the foe Eight months
in the year military exertions are impossible, during
fou r months only can any thing be done The Indians
well understand this, and, during these four months,
either give, or receive an attack as they please, or
endeavor to consume the season in wiley parleys
The possibility of splendid military exploits does
not exist in such a country, and against such a
foe' but there is room there, and ample room
there, for the exhibition of the highest qualities of
the sold er There is room there for patience, and
for fortitude, under every variety of suffering, and
under every form of privation There is room
there for courage and discipline to exhibit itself
against perils and trials which subject courage and
discipline to the s verest tesis And has there been
anj f?ilure ot patience, fortitude, courage, disci-
p'me,and subordination in all this wai? Where is
the instance in which the men have revolted against
their officers or in which the officer has deserted
bis men' Where is the instance of a flight m bat-
tle'J Where the instance of orders disobeyed, ranks
broken, or confusion of corps'*   On the cortrary,
e hive constantly seen the steadiness, and tne
disc plirn-, of the parade maintained under every
Janger, and in the presence of massacre itself
Officers and men have fought it out where they
were told to fight, they have been killed in the
tracks m which they were told to stand None of
those pitiable scenes of which all eur Indian wars
have shown some—those harrowing sce"es in which
the helpless prisoner, or the hapless fugitive, is
massacred without pity, and without resistance,
none of these have been seen Many have pe-
aished, but it was the death of the combatant in.
arms, and not of the captive or the fugitive In
no one of our savage wars have our troops so stood
together, ana conquered togelher, and died to-
gether, as they hie done m this one, and this
standing og°ther is th  test of the soldier's charac-
ter Steadiness, suboidination, courage, disci-
pline, the«e are the test of the soldier, and in no
instance have our troops, or any troops, ever
evinced the possession of these qualit es in a higher
degree than during the campaigns in F nrida
Wh. e, hen, brilliant viclrr.es may not have been
seen, and m fact were impossible, yet the highest
qualities of good soldiership have been eminently
displayed throughout th's war. Courage and dis-
cipline have show n themselves, throughout all its
stages, in then noblest forms
From the general imputation of inefficiency m
our operations m Florida, the Semtor from South
Carolina [Mr Preston] comes to a particular com-
mander, and charges inefficiency specifically upon
him This commander is General Jesup The
Senator from South Caronna has been lavish, and
even profuse, m his denunciation of that General,
and has gone so far as to talk about military courts
of inquiry Leaving the General open to all such
inquiry, and thoroughly convinced that the Sena-
tor f-om South Carol na has no idea of moving
such inquiry, and intends to rest the effect of his
denunciat on upon its delivery here, I shall pro-
ceed to answer him here—giving speech forspepch
on this floor, and leaving the General himself to
reply when it comes to that threatened inquiry,
which I undertake to affirm will never be moved
General Jesup is charged with lmbrcihty and
inefficiency, the continuance of the war is imputed
to his incapacity, and he is held up here, on the
floor of the Senate, to public reprehension for the^e
imputed delinquencies This is the accusation,
and now let us see w ith how much truth and justice
it is made Happily tor General Jesup, this hap-
pens to be a case in which we have data to go up-
on , and in w h.ch there are authentic materials for
comparing the operations of himself w uh those of
other Generals—his predecessors in the same field
—with whose success the Senator from South Ca-
rolina is entirely satisfied Datts and figmes fnr-
nisn this data and these materials, and after re-
freshing the memory of the Senate with a few
diles, I wi'l proceed to the answ ers which the facts
of the case supply Thefi st date is, as to the
line of the commencement of this wai, the second,
as to the time that General Jesup assumed the
command, the third, as to the time when he was
relieved from the command On the first point, it
will be recollected that the war broke out upon the
assassination of General Thompson, the  agent,
Lieut Smith, who was with him, the suttler and
his clerks, the murder of the two expresses, and
the ma sacre of Major Dade's command, events
which came together in point of time, and com-
peted an immediate resort to war by the United
States These assassinations, these murders, and.
this massacre, took place on the 28th day of De-
cember, 1835 The commencement of the war
then dates from that day Tfee next po,nt is, the
time of General Jesup's appointment to the com-
mand This occurred in December, 1836 The
th rd point is, the date of General Jesup's relief
fiom the command, and this took place in May, of
the present year, 1838 The war has then con-
tinued, counting to the present time, two years and
a half, and of that period, General Jesup has had
command something less than one year and a half.
Oiher Generals had command for a year before he
was appointed in that quarter Now, how much
had those other Generals done' All put together,
how much had they done' And I ask this question
not to disparage their meritorious, exertions, but to
obtain data for the vindication of the officer now
assailed Tne Senator from South Carolina is
satisfied with the operations of the previous com-
manders, now let him see how the operations of
the officer whom he assails will compare with the
operations of those who are honored with his appro-
bation
The Senate will recollect that, early m the pre-
sent session, a Senator from Massachusetts [Mr
Davis] made a very detailed call upon the Secre-
tary at War, for information upon all the events
of the Florida war, and that an answer, fully com-
mensurate with the call, was duly returned That
answer was prm'ed by the order of the Senate, and
const tutes No 226 of our Executive documents
One of the inquiries contained in the call was, as
to the numbei of the killed, wounded, and prison
ers by our arms during this war' To that call I
find this response in. the answer of the Secretary
Fro~n the commencement of lidian hosti ities m Florida
zn December 183^ inclusive nf November 1S36 it is seen
l lal the number of Indians reported to have beenkiled is
]31 the number of Indian , women children ard negroes
taken prisoners withm the same period 15 '
This statement, it will be perceived, comes down
to the exact period at which General Jesup took the
command, namely, December, 1836, the totality of
the killed to that day was 131, the totality of
the prisoners 15, making an aggregate of 146
Now we will see the result of General Jesup's ope-
rations These amount to two thousand two hun-
dred prisoners' and the killed may amount to se-
venty or eighty Such are the comparative results
In prisoners, 2,200 against 15, in killed, about half
as many under General Jesup as undei his prede-
cessors Putting the totals of killed and prisoners
together, and it will be 2 270 against 146, a differ-
ence of fifteen to one in favor of General Jesup'
Sir, I disparage nobody I make no exhibit of
comparative results to undervalue the operations
ot the previous commanders in Florida I know
the difliculty of miliary operations (here and the
ease of criticism here I never assailed those pre
vious commanders, on the contrary, often pointed
out the nature oí the theatre on which they ope-
rated as a cause for the miscarriage of expeditions,
and for the want of brilliant and decisne results
Now for the frst time I refer to the point, and,
not to disparage otheis, but to vindicate the officer
assailed His \ nidi-ation is found m the compari-
son of results between himself and his predeces-
sors, and in the approbation of the Senator front
South Ca olma ci the results under the predeces-
sor  of Geneiai J sup Satisfied with them, he must
be satisfied w ith him, for the difference is as fif
teen to one in favor of th" decned Genera!
Be^ des the general denunciation for inefficiency,
wh ch the Senator from South Cirolma ms la-
vished upon General Jesup, and which denun-
lation has so completely received it-answer in
his comparative statement, besides this general
enunciation, the Senator from South Carol na
brought forwaid a specific accusation against the
honor of the same officer—an accusal on ui p-t
fidy, and of a violatien of flag of truce, m the
seizure and detsntion of the Indian Powell, «ho
had come into his camp On the part of General
Jesup, I repel this accusation, and declare n.j
