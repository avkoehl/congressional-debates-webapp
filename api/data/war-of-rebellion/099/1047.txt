AUGUSTA, GA., January 26, 1865.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: It seems to me that the orders to Iverson to re-enforce Ferguson in case of an advance upon Southwest Georgia leave us here in a very exposed position. There is nothing else upon the line of Brier Creek but Iverson's command. Should it be moved entirely or in part Augusta is uncovered. I hope that his orders will be modified until the arrival of re-enforcements and the sending of infantry down.

Very respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The order to Iverson to re-enforce Fergugon in cas of an advance upon the latter would, if executed, uncover Augusta. I have no other troops that Iverson's upon Brier Creek. I hope that the order will be modified until re-enforcements arrive and I can get infantry upon Brier Creek.

Respectfully and truly,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry

GENERAL: Troops are reaching Augusta from Hood's army. It is of infinite importance that you should delay them by fighting them vigorously. The whole of Georgia is full of bitter complaints of Wheeler's cavalry. I hope that your stout and gallant resistance will redeem the odium cast upon the command. I learned to-day, to my great surprise, that there were no fortifications at Brannon's Bridge. I have
