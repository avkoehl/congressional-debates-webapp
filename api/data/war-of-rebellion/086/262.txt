is inexplicable. Lest it may have altogether miscarried, a copy* is herewith inclosed. The necessity of reducing the number of animals to be wintered at the post under your command to the lowest practicable limit you will perceive was anticipated in that dispatch, as well as in that directed to Colonel Thomas, 24th ultimo, which failed to reach him at Wadsworth. An order was issued on 22nd instant directing the march from Fort Ridgely to Fort Wadsworth of Company F, First U. S. Volunteers. It was the intention to station an additional company of that regiment and four companies of Second Cavalry at that post, but other arrangements have been made with regard to the former, but General Sibley trusts that you have not dispatched more than one company of the cavalry with the horses, although your last dispatch indicates an intention to send two of the five companies for that purpose. There should be not less than five companies at Fort Wadsworth during the winter. It is to be hoped that the men's quarters will be completed before the setting in of the cold weather. You will please report to these headquarters the number and condition of the animals retained at Fort Wadsworth as soon as practicable.

By command of Brigadier-General Sibley:

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DIST. OF MINNESOTA, DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,Saint Paul, Minn., October 26, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM PFAENDER,

Commanding Second Sub-District, Fort Ridgely, Minn.:

COLONEL: You are respectfully informed that Brackett's battalion was under orders to leave Sioux City on the 25th instant, and is probably on its way to this district. It is the intention of General Sibley to post the greater part, if not all, of the battalion at Fort Ridgely, or points convenient thereto, so as to have it in an available position for an early spring movement, and you are instructed to make arrangements accordingly. The orders for the movements of the companies of the U. S. Volunteers and of the Second Cavalry have probably reached you, or will reach you in a day or two, and will so much diminish the force at Ridgely as to enable you to quarter the greater part, at least, of the battalion at that post. You will report without delay to these headquarters what number of men can be comfortably provided for after the march of the several companies ordered to other points. It is desirable, also, that an early report be received of the number of animals now at Fort Ridgely, whether serviceable or unserviceable, and how many can be provided with stabling there.

By command of Brigadier-General Sibley:

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.- General Sibley also desires to be informed whether more transportation will be needed in your sub-district in addition to the teams already furnished you; and, if so, what amount.

Respectfully,

R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
