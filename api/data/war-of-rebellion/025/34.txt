CORINTH, VIA CAIRO, June 26, 1862-7.40 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

When I took command of this department the gun and mortar boats were placed under my orders. I am led to infer from one of your telegrams that a charge has been made. If so, I have never been notified of it. I received no information of the whereabouts or movements of gunboats. Under such circumstances it is impossible to co-operate. I have no official information of any of our gunboats an Arkansas, and General Curtis telegraphed yesterday that he could hear nothing of them, while a rebel gunboat is destroying large amounts of cotton on White River.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
