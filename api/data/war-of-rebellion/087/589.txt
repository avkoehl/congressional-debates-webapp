Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Numbers 214. Reports of Brigadier General Orlando B. Willcox, U. S. Army, commanding Third Division, of operations August 19 - 21 and August 25 - 26.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, Va., August 31, 1864.

I at once ordered the First Brigade (1,100 strong) of my division, commanded by Brigadier-General Hartranft, to proceed to the support of Crawford. The move was made in the direction of the enemy's main attack, handsomely checking his advance, and eventually compelling him to retire to the cover of the wood in which were Crawford's rifle-pits. From this cover he soon, however, again advanced to within about seventy-five yards of the First Brigade, and his charge was again successfully repulsed by it, with a loss
