CONGRESSIONAL feLQBB.________________________399
toll by the honorable Senator from Missouri, [Mr
Benton ] The amendment of that Senator ex-
tended the charters of the bank  of the District
iwo years, on the condition that they should re-
deem their five dollar bills, from and after the first
of August, with gold or silver, and thwr bills of all
denominations from the first of January next
Now, he was very willing, and indeed anxious, to
extend the charters or these banks agreeably to
their existing provisions By these provisions the
banks were required at all times to redeem then
notes with specie, and were forbidden to issue
notes under the denomination of five dollars la
oonsequence of the suspension of specie payments
by the banks m the different State*, the District
banks, from what appeared to be an unavddable
necessity, Were also compelled to suspend He
was very willing, tacitly, to acquiesce a while lon-
gCT in this necessity, and to ren w the charters of
all these banks, without any express reference, in
the renewal, to their departure lrom the specie
standard But, when brought to vote duectly on
the question, whethei their suspension of specie
payments shall receive the formal sanction of this
body, as it would, if the amendment of the Senator
from Missouri should be adopted, he must vote
against it He could never consent to give bis
sanction, by a format vote, to a coarse of this kind,
however much he mjgfet be disposed to aeaaiesce in
it. He vvoaMf'noi Ihyidéíhe principle of specie
payments into parts, as the amendment proposed,
ant vote to sanction their failure for a time, on the
condition that the banks shottld resume at a future
distant day He asked how Senators on this side
offlle, Sail, who had, during the whole of the extra
and this session, spoken and voted against the banks
for suspending specie payments, could now turn
round and give their direct sanction to this suspen-
sion' He would cheerfully go with them m re
newing the charters of the District banks, without
.aying any thing about their suspension, but he
^ould not vote for the amendment of the Senator
from Missouri He would, thciefore, move to
amend that amendment so that the charléis ot these
banks should be extended as proposed, piovided
they ^redeemed their bills, of all denominations,
with gold or silver, from and after the day on which
the act is to take effect, and provided further that
their charters should be null and void, if they failed
so to redeem their bills He submitted this mo
tion with reluctance, and solely m consequence of
(he amendment proposed by the Senator from Mis-
souri He would preter the extension of the char-
ters according to their existing provisions, which
required all that could or need be required m rela-
tion to specie payments
Mr KING said it was uttetly impossible tor
them to do so at present If it was the intention
of his friend from Michigan to destroy these insti-
tutions, it was well He certainly hid taken a
most effectual mole, but as he presumed that was
not the motive of the honoiab'e Senator, nor to
prolong a discussion already too piotracted, he
hoped the amendment w ould be w ithdrawn
Mr BUCHANAN hoped the Senaioi from
Michigan would not persist m his amendment, as
it would be ruinous to the banks oí the District
Mr NORVELL repealed the consider? lions
which had induced his molion So far from de-
siring to injure the District banks, he wished to see
their charters renew ed, and would cheerfully vole
for the bill with one or two modifications, by no
means unfavorable to them, reported by the Com-
mittee on the District of Columbia He would,
however, as his friends from Alabama and Penn-
sylvania had requested it, withdraw hv¡ amend-
ment and content himself with voting against the
amendment proposed by the Senator from Mis-
souri
Mr HUBB ARD moved to = nke out the four
clauses in the proviso of Mr Benton's amendment,
and insert a provision that the present charters
should be extended during the pleasure of Con-
gress, being m the mean time subject to any modi-
fications Congress might think proper to make,
and subject also to a repeal, at the discretion of
Congress.
Mr. BUCHANAN would not go for the propo-
sition of the Senator, it would amount to a per-
petual charter He was not for destroying these
banks, on the contrary, he was for sustaining them
so long as they adhered to what was right and
correct
Mr KING expressed an earnest desire to bring this
matter to a close The bill before them was vastly
superior, because it contained many salutary pro-
visions. If gentlemen were so desirous to narrow
down the time, why not take the bill as it was,
and limit the duration to a shorter period While
up, he would lake occasion to vindicate the banks
from aspersions which had been thro  n upon them
at different times during the discussion If gentle
men would look to New York, Bosten, and Phila-
delphia, where banks with immense capital avere
forced to yield to the pressure, how could corpora-
tions like them, with small capital, hold out 1 he
fact was, to the last moment, they did their best,
asd should not now be lorced mio measures which
would be oppressive to them, and distressing to the
citizens of the District He would vote for the
amendment of the Senator from Missouri with
great reluctance, and he did sow-ii'i a view of giv-
ing time, under the hope that a better temper and
spirit would prevail in relation to the matter
Mr BAYARD ihought a limited period would
be better than an indefinite one
Mr STRANGE thousrlu, of all the dangerous
propositions ever enteitiuned, tint suggested by the
Senator from New Hampshire [Mi HxnmiiD]
was the most so Was not every member of Con-
gress exposed to the temptations of these banks—
nay, the very President himself might be amena-
ble to corruption, through the veto lie did
not pretend to say that such things would be, suf-
ficient for him was the opinion that they might be
He did not believe with the Senator from Ktn-
tuck" tint the Bank ol the United States had never
íatcrfeied m the elections, on the contrarj, he be-
lieved that it hid exercised a very dangerous in-
fluence He agreed with the Senator from Michi-
gan, (hat we sht aid not countenance institutions
that were duly flying in the fue ol law and rij;ht
He would volt lor the amendment ot the Senatoi
from Missouu is Lest cak ulated to place them in
a position to sieure the interests of the community,
without viol itmg their ch irtered privileges
Mi BENION w is cenain tint, if the amend-
ment ol theStinloi lrom New II imp hire prei ail
ed, the bank? would run on until they stttkd down,
as the pleasure ol Congress would be the pleasure
or memliirt ot Coiiffrtss Suppose i member of
Congitss wanted a disccunt, while an industrious
mechanic or men hant of the District required or 
at the same time—tlie bankcouldnot accommohte
both, and what then would be the result The
direotois would saj if we do not oblige the member
we shall lose the bank Do not gentlemen see
that the bank could not be a fice agenl The banks
themselves and the people o£ the District ought to
be opposed to it I look upon it, said Mr B as one
of the most objectionable measures evei presented
to Congiess
Mr HUBBARD said, as his amendment seemed
to find no f ivor in tne ejes of either the fnentls or
enemy ■< oí ihc bill, he would withdraw it, but he
slill believsd it the most w Ik leiome and proper that
coal! be adopted
The question now lecuinng on Mr Hiatos, s
amendmi nt,
Mr   tUOHAJNKN moved to modify it by r*.

er than the 1st of Janimy, 1839, if the pnneipal
banks in Baltimore and Richmond  should soonei
