GENERAL: The cavalry under my command are picketing at Owen's Ford and all the roads west and south from Temperance Chapel. My left connects with the Sixth Corps at Anderson's crossing on Little River. Nothing but cavalry appears in my front across the river.

Very respectfully,

Lieutenant-Colonel Fifth New York Cavalry.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 25, 1864.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: My picket-line covers General Cutler's front almost entirely. I have asked him to relieve it, but he does not do it. I hope you will order it as my men are exhausted with the constant duty they have been on. I connect with General Griffin.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

The enemy made an attempt yesterday to reach the river. He advanced and intrenched on our right, and it is at the point where he is closest that the firing is going on.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, May 25, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I am connected with Griffin [right of Fifth Corps] and am forming my lines nearly parallel to road lying south of and nearly parallel to railroad. Nothing of enemy discovered so far except cavalry, and Colonel Hammond's force of cavalry now here has seen nothing more. I have requested him to send a squadron back to watch the ford over Little River on the road which crosses the railroad nearly in front of the right of General Warren's position of yesterday.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding.
