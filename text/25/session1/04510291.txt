Postponeme?it ofjourth instalment—Mr, Menefee.
H. of Reps,
were, as such, substantially converted, by that act, into so
many agents and instruments of the Federal Treasury Under
this pretension, the use of the money, by the ¡states, es en for
the shortest penods, orto the least extent, was wholly forbid
den For if Congress could authorize the u^e of it by th«
States, without interest or equivalent, for an mdefm te arm
they might, upon the same punciple, and with equal propriety
wholly relinquish it to the i-states the constitutional p nver to
do which the ad* ocateá of his con^ ruction den>
The idea of the General Government collecting its va-¿ isve
nue, from its mnumeiableeomce^ all over the Union, villi its
multitude of collecting officers Immsj our seaboard   and of
receivers of public money scatteied over the whole W ^st and
all the expense and machmei/ belonging to so extended a
eystem, to divide out amongst the twenty si< State*  to i(, held
without use by them, or interest to the Government, for the
purpose of being returned when tlemanded, fc> utter y madmis
sible as a measure of finance purely    But a small advance
would be needed under a sjstem like tnie, to require the reve
nue, after its collection, to be returncu to the indivjd at- from
whom collected, to be by then held as agents of the Ireasui)
and repaid when wanted for the immediate use ot Govern
ment    Its clumsiness, and utter imbecilit}   as a system oí
finance, would justly fix reproach on any nation tint should
adopt it
But, sir, the error of this construction is still more manifest,
when it is remembeiedthat Con°ress, in the antecedent pait
of the same act, formally and minutely provide^ for the depo
site of the public monej in the State banks, anothtr addition
to the deformed ind unr atunl system attempted to be lound
in that act As a system of finance, who, with a proper respect
for his reputation will coi eit to «taud forth is its champion/
Who will encime the paternity of "uch a financial mons ei?
Who so reckless of the > j m n s of the world as publicly, m
his plac here, to hold fellow hip with lú I di3iiusb this view
of the question Gravel) to re,lute &udi a constiuetion, would
be an act of violence to the wiadom of Pongiess and the
national character
No, sir, (said he,) the act. of the 23a of June was no financial
expedient If is more imposing It is the offspring of consi
derations tenderly affecting the Federal Constitution and the
purity of itsadmmi*-t<'ation
By acou^Boi fedetal lbgi-datiou, whether bon-Jiitutiopal 01
unconsti utionaí wise oi unwise, is of no moment here, i large
revenue had accumulated beyond the wants ot the Ti**asurj
La ee howtvei as this surplus was, it cannot be pretended
that its mpip cu tody by tht Government was impiacticable,
or even elili i It 1 o full competency to this end was never
questioned Vet, íro n die eaihest period of this accumulation,
it was unnei^all/ r aaided with an eye not only of drnrut
and appreieisioi b tot absolute abhorrence It was \iewul
as the cheadfojn am fiom which were destined to flow cxtrava
¿anee n the ^ede al expenditures, augmenta ion of Executive
power, anda1! else that was hobtile to the Constitution and
danfeerou  to public liberty Soi, sir was it viewed many

warrant The wors pred c ion? ol its pernicious influences

e\panled (o it*  fullest constitutional dimension , seated on ih s
samp surplus, itiJ wie'd^d by a popular hand, wrenched from
ltg co ordinate departments every check, and demolished every
balance designed for its restraint Under an abused, if not un
constitutional power of removal from office, the indep°ndence
ot public officers, so necessary to a pure administration, broken
down to the basest, servility and the whole corps tiansformed
fio n servants of t * people and officers of the law into an
aimy of mercenaries obe hent to Executive comniiní no mat
tei what commanding The Senate—piostiattd ut > rlv The
Judiciary, contemned, defied, and principle** advanced operly
by the Executive, abolishing every vestige of restraint through
that department Congr 33—a seducing patronage perpeti ally
playing upin it—the veto lightly and capnciousivhurled at u
—the practice of withholding bill1*, insulting and demanding it
—the puise violently wtested Horn it—th„ n^u'itiou of the
cuire.icy nsuiped—<t& smt moken—and at last uhjurafed
and outs ti e tched ^t the feet of the Executive The people-
deceived, despised, most grievously distressed Their most
highly favored measareb—the bank bill, the ¡and bill the cur
íency bill, successively perishing under the veto, 01 that other
more terrible power Their currency, m rass tora asui der
by the hand that had snatched it from fongi ess
I do not insist sir, that all these evils, or the mo*it ol them
even, flowed from the Miiplus But I do insist that the ten
deicy of that surplus, whenever ard however it operated—and
in some form or o the 1 it incessantly opeiated— was pernicious
m every aspect, indm the extreme
Was it, then, in the least surmising, that the statesmen oí the
Limed otates should hive stii/en to lelieve the Govenmient
of this sin plus? The subject oí its deposition aecorlmetv be
came, at, earl} as 1829 suffic eptlv important to find a plate in
the annual message of tiiePiesident
" A  then said he, " the period approaches when the apj. h
cation ot the, revenue to tlie payment of the public debt will
cease, th°disposition 0/ the surplus will present a subject ior
the serious consideration of Congress "
Ihat this íecommendation may be dulv. estimated it is of
importance to lcmembei that it was contained m hi-, first
3VW-.ige, whilst ffammg with ardoi to sisnabzn his administra
tion by a radical refoimationof the Government then supposed
to tejm with abu°e Itwa> meint as a mea&uit, of puritica

mg increase of the suiplus sub«tqi eith, if disposition never
afWrwa ds attracted his attention, it a emplov ment fen evil
hivmg unfoitunatelj entered into the plan of his \dm n  .
tration
The notice of Congress and the American People hav mg
been thus formally and officially diawn to a d ^po=íition of'he
surplus, it fonnedj up to thf present year, a ynomuient --uhieet
of their consideration In condemning the surplu as a lamen
table evil, and m the piopneiy of some effectual eh po-aticm of
it there was but one opinion The divisions found to prevail
related only to the mode of disposition The Me^saae of 1829
had distinct y announced the mode then most acceptable t> the
Executive
" To avoid these ev lis,5  said he,   f it appear? to me that the

those who oppose the bill un lei ronsiderino 1, to maintain the
