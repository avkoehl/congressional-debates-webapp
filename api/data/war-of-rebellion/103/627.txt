HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST FLORIDA,Barrancas, February 1, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans, La.:

COLONEL: Since my communication of the 26th ultimo there have been some changes in the enemy's forces between Mobile and Pollard. The force at the latter place was considerably increased a few days since; by some reports put as high as 15,000, but I have no satisfactory account at this time. Shall probably get reliable information in the course of a day or two. My impression is that some part of the force at Pollard has gone to Montgomery. The railroad was again opened from Blakely to Pollard about the 24th ultimo.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THO. J. MCKEAN,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

A telegram just received from General Allen, Louisville, states that your order to me, of the 26th of January, means 5,000 cavalry instead of five divisions, as I was informed. Which is correct - 5,000 or five divisions? Are they and A. J. Smith's command to take their transportation with them?

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
