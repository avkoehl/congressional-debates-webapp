Mr COOPBIt Yes, air, every schoolboy knows that The
President and the Senate must make peace, and if I drd not say
so, I exposed myseif very imperfectly I know I used the
word Senate Now, as to the question whether we were at
war with the Seminóles or not What was Wdi? It v^as wlfn
men met by international law to kill one another in a legitímate
way, where guns were Ubed, and horses and camp equipage
This was war, and we were getting out of it most ridiculously
All our eflbits had been to get out of it ever since it was com
menced, and yet, after spending twenty millions of money we
■Were not out of it yet For the satisfaction of the gentleman
from New Yoik, [Mr Morgan ] who said that by purs img a
pacific policy and leítir g the Indians know that ihey were no
more to be molested, the war coi Id be ended m four weeks let
me (said Mr C) state a few facts These experiments had
been made without success by every general who had gone mto
the field General Clncn, Geaeial Games Gereval ^cott, and
down to Colonels Harney and Woith, had all tried this picific
policy—had all proclaimed that the war was ended And we
were as far from ending it as ever Why, he would a«k,
cease from ho=tiii ie=, if there is no war? Whereiore the
declaration ol he co one) in conmund, of ace^satnn of hostil
ities, if there is no wart Mr C then took a ha&ty view
of the opera ions oí Generals Gáines and Scott against the
Seminóles, and showed how these expenmen <j of a pacific na
ture had always failed and how the Indians unifoimly got the
advantage He then noticed another remaik of the gentleman
from New York which was—that this war was begun by the
Government of fr'e United S ates, and was founded ir cruelty
He would not go through the details of the his ory of this war,
to show how much the gentleman wis in error, but would con
tent himself with remin ling him of afew i romment facts Did
the gentleman overlook all the considerations of feeling and
humanity for the whites—the women and children who were
murdered by these savages 1 Did he forest th<- treacherous as
sassmauonoi the agent Thompson, by O ceoía'í Did he foi
get, while th& veiy pioposition of Colonel Worth to eus
pendal host hues was before the President that they passed
by his lines and went into the State of Georsia where they
cut  the  throats  of men,   women,   and   chil icn **
Mr C tiienreferied to thecoittoversv between the Governor
of Georgia and the Secretary of VVai, in relation to the
operations of the United States troops in his folate and
the request of the former to I ave them removed About
* twelve montl sago, in reply to the earnest solicitations of the
Governor, the Secrc ai y promised that a certain desmp ion of
forces [mill ia] should be ernnl ved for the pioteetion of the
people«f the State It wa^ not, perhaps more than three month*
before that he had give i or lera to th*1 comman ling officer to
disband the militia ihen in ^1*1 e and is &ooms that was done,
the Indians came aeio=s t ie Gnoi"ia lne and murdered whole
families On be ng addre^ed on the subject, by the Go\ ernor
and earnestly solicited to do so, two comnaniesof mihfia wcie
called i ito service, but m a short time in order to get rid of the
expense, these companies were di nis^ed, and immedia e > the
Indians besan again to cío s the line an 1 commit üVir depreda
lions and muiders Cxp stuk'ion after expostulation was
made by the Governoi, both to the pr sent Secretary and to his
predecessor, [Mr Bell,l but still the War Department continues
to pursue the same policy The Indians pass by t! e sta'ion
of Colonel Worth, wuhsn a mile or a mile and a half of him,
and go m'o the adjoin re country oí Geoi-na committing
the greatest enormities The lcsult of all thr- was, that the
Governor wiote to the Secretan asking him to remove the
United State*, troops and «tatm* that he would defend the S ate
by means of her own militia He would «¡ate the reason why
the Go\ernor pieferred militia to the regular troops It was
not because Colonel Worth was nota good officer, not because
the United States troops weie not good soldiers but it was be
cause the Indian* feared the militia whose feelings were excit
ed by the murders they had committed on their defenceless
■women ani1 children and would not daie to face them They
knew that the Georgia rni'itia were burning to averge these
enormities, and would hunt them out and ca ch or kill them
while, on the other hand, the sympathies of the Um td "tat s
sildiei*— moa ly foieigners and some Northern men—weie in
their favoi They knew that if they encounteied the la t the
worst that could happen to them would be to- e taken andfea&t
ed awhile on beef and ciacktfrs and then shipped ofl to the west
There wasanothei thing I e wished to bring t the consideia ion

Mr O would ask the House to scan that !et'er¿ and mark the

Mr FILLMORE here stated that the Committee of Confer

Mr F1LLMOJSD then moved the previous question, which

Mr I FVY appealed to Mr F to withdraw the motion, to en

Oi motion of Mr FÍLI VORC theHon«ere->oUeditsclfinto
Committee of the W utile on the e aieof the l non The un
finished busines  of Friday w as the bill making appropriations
for the navy for the ye\r 1842 ■The pending motion was that
made by Mr MeriwetAer of Georgia, to strike out m the first
item 83,195,432, and inseVj. S2,835,0G0
Mi J I MAkON was\erimled to the floor He saidhe
should have f referred that a^diffeient motion fiom that now un-
der consider ltion had oeen made He himself wished a partial
and temporary appropriation, to supply the pressing demands
of the service until the House coulo obtamstifliaent information
to enab'e it to act under&taibnety up m the more important
items m the bill He wished th s for two reasons fist, because
of the exhausted condition of our Treasury, and, secondly, be-
cause the appropnations now askad for by the Navy Depart*
ment exceeded by near S3 Otü 000 the amount which Was called
profligate and extrxvagant during the admmistrauon of Mr.
Van Buren Before C ui^ress app opriated a large amount
toward the navy he wished to know wheie it was to come
from, what were the resources upon which we had to depend,
and what was to become of the land bi'l He was aware that
many prom itions had been made m the service , still, he was
not yet satisfied that theie was íeasoft for such a large appro-
priation as was a«ked Jor There weie many items in the bill
to which he objtcted—ho^efor coui s menial which had be-
come so common m the coun ry, andw'nch were the subject of
«■o much abute He alluded particularly to the court martial
lectntly ne d in Baltimore—a court martial which had been sit
ting for three months when it should have discharged its duties
m as many weeks He should call the attention ol the House,
at the proper time, 11 the extrav   anee attending it
Mr M then read the amendment v hicn lie proposed to of-
fer to the bill Its effect was tostr ke out a 1 after tho enact-
ing clause, and introduce a sec ion appioinatig #1,000,000
to meet the actual and pressing demands of the Navy Depart-
ment—the sum of $1,000 000 to be considered as a part of the an-
nual appioprtation hereafter to be made.
The CHAIRMAN (Mr Cure ro of Mame) decided the
amendment to be out of 01 det at thtbtime
