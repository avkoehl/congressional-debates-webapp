Colonel T. J. JACKSON,

Commanding Virginia Volunteers, Harper's Ferry, Va.:

COLONEL: The letter addressed to you, of this day's date, was erroneous. You will therefore destroy it, and, instead of extending your call for volunteers to the counties of Page, Pendleton, and Warren, as therein directed, extend it to the counties of Shenandoah, Page, Warren, and Rockingam, limiting the number to troops to that specified in letter of the 1st instant.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major A. LORING, Wheeling, Va.:

MAJOR: The authority given you to call out volunteers in the service of the State, by me letter of the 29th ultimo, has, by the proclamation of the governor, of the 3rd instant, been confined to the counties of Tyler, Wetzel, Marshall, Ohio, Brooke, and Hancock, and you will act accordingly.

Colonel GEORGE A. PORTERFIELD, Harper's Ferry, Va.:

It is desired to hold both branches of the railroad to the Ohio River, to prevent its being used to the injury of the State. You must, therefore, choose your position with this view, that you may readily re-enforce troops on either branch. Major A. Loring, at Wheeling, has been directed, with the volunteer force under his command, to give protection to the terminus of the main road at the Ohio River, with whom you will communicate and co-operate. You will also place a force on the Parkersburg Branch, at such point as you may select, under a suitable officer, with necessary orders for his guidance. Major F. M Boykin, jr., of the Virginia volunteers, who will act under your orders, has been previously authorized to call out volunteers from that section of country, and you are authorized, under the proclamation of the governor, of the 3rd instant, to extend the call to the counties of Wood, Wirt, Roane, Calhoun, Gilmer, Ritchie, Pleasant, and Dodridge, to rendezvous at Parkersburg, and to the counties of Braxton, Lewis, Harrison, Monongalia, Taylor, Barbour, Upshur, Tucker, Marion, Randolph, and Preston, to rendezvous at Grafton.
