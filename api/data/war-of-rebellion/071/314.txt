HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,July 14, 1864. (Received 4. 10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

My command moved from Offutt's Cross-Roads at 4. 30 o'clock this morning, and advanced to near Seneca Creek, when, learning nothing from the cavalry on the Rockville road, and getting intelligence through a small party, which had been sent from the cavalry in my immediate front, which had been driven in, that the enemy was in full force at Darnestown, I have halted until I can ascertain the truth of the report by an infantry reconnaissance now out. I believe that the bulk of the enemy's force has already crossed the river at Edwards Ferry. This fact will shortly be developed, and, if they have left Darnestown, I shall continue the march to Edwards Ferry. I send three prisoners, one an officer, who says that the bulk of their command has already crossed the river. One of his men also reports that General Franklin escaped Tuesday, about nine miles from Baltimore. Is positive of this. The march is rather a severe one, the men straggling badly. The teams are green, and the trains consequently move much less rapidly than the infantry. At last accounts none of the Nineteenth Corps had joined. General Gillmore sprained his foot seriously last night, and has probably returned to the city.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

My cavalry is in the immediate vicinity of Poolesville, and finds the enemy in some force. He has opened upon the cavalry with two guns. What the force is not yet developed, but will be determined as soon as the infantry column (the head of which is about half an hour in rear) comes up.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,Poolesville, Md., June 14, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report my arrival at this point, and that most of the infantry of this corps and a part of the artillery have come up. The train is stretched along the road for a great distance, and will not be all up by midnight, if so soon. Judging from last reports the troops of the Nineteenth Corps will not reach this place by ten miles to-night.

The cavalry overtook the rear guard of the enemy's cavalry at this point, which fell back after a slight skirmish, taking the road to White's Ford, where the main body of the enemy, with his trains,
