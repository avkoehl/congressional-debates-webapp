tain, an immense national debt on which the in-
terest is to be paid, and an army of favorites of
Congress and the Administration who are per-
mitted to plunder the Treasury in the shapeof
contracts and largesses, and not a few who steal
from it directly. During the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1809, the receipts of our Government
amounted to $370,943,747, and its expenditures
to $321,-490,597. And in addition to that sum
our people have to bear the expense of State
and municipal governments, amounting prob-
ably to $150,000,000, support their voluntary
church establishments, and pay the rents re-
quired of them for their homes and places of
business. Putting all together, the people of
the United States are now taxed higher than
any other people; and in this is to b5 found the
cause of the decrease in the purchasing power
of wages and the gradual impoverishment of
the laboring classes. In this country the com-
pensation of labor is not adequate to meet the
burdens imposed upon the workingman; and
hence the diminution in his means of living and
enjoyment.
To show at a glance the great and alarming
increase of receipts, expenditures, and taxa-
tion since 1SG0 I present the following table:
18G0. 1869.
Population (in round
number?)  31,500,003 40,000,000
Revenue (exclusive of
loitns, ami including
sales of public lands). £51,982,803 00 $370,943,747 00
Expenditures (exclud-
ing payment of the
princioal of thepubiic
debt)  63,155,728 00 321.J90.597 00
Taxation (per capita)... 171 9 27
Kxpenditure (per cap-
ita)  2 CO 8 03
Thus it will be seen that the ratio of taxa-
tion per capita in the years J 8G0 and 1809 is
as $1 74 to $9 27, or more than six times as
much in 1869 ; and the ratio of expenditures
as $2 is to $8 03, or more than four times as
much.
In this connection I propose to show how
the expenditures of the Federal Government
can be reduced:
The total amount of cxpendiiurcs under !Mr. Bu-
chanan's administration in 186i), which I am will-
ing to adopt as a standard ot frugality and econ-
omy, was  $63,155,728
Deduct interest on tbo public debt  3,144,620
Total of ordinary expenditures  860,011,108
During the first, financial year of General Grant's ad-
ministration, ending June 30,1869, the whole amount
of expenditures was $321,490,597
Deduct interest on the public debt  130,094,242
Total ordinary expenditures $190,796,355
Expenditures under Mr. Buchanan  $60,011,103
Add to this one third, being m the ratio
of the increase of population  20,003.702
Showing what General Grant's ordinary
expenditures should be  &S0 014,810
What General Grant's ordinaly expenditures actu-
ally are $190,796,355
Deduct what they should be  80,014,310
Excess over what they shoiild be S110.7S1.515
I!overmes collccted in 1868-63 $370,043,747
Deduct interest on the pub-
lic debt $130,694,597
And the sum thatshould now
be expended for ordinary
purposes  80,014.810
    210,709,407
Leaving the sum of. §160,234,340
which should be saved andleftin the pockets of
the people or applied to the payment of the na-
tional debt. Of that sum $100,000,000 should
be left in the pockets of the people by reducing
taxation, and the remainder applied to the pay-
ment of the public debt. That would bo the
policy of the true statesman.
Another consideration should have weight
with the advocates of the "protective" system
to induce them to modify their immoderate
demands. Until the late unfortunate civil war
the revenues of the Government had been
raised mainly by duties on importations, by a
tariff tax. Those taxes have been shaped and
imposed to promote the interests of the manu-
facturing or " protected " classes; and under
their operation the manufacturing classes and
the States in which they reside have grown
wealthy far more rapidly than the agricultural
classes and States. The effect of the tariff
system has been to abstract the wealth from
the agricultural States—the West and South—
and transfer it to the East or to New England,
Pennsylvania grabbing her share in this transit
of wealth. Hence the system has tended to
impoverish the West and South and to enrich
the East.
Until the late war the friends of "protec-
tion" sedulously inculcated the doctrine that
the tariff system was the only system by which
the required revenue could be obtained; that
the people would tolerate no other system ;
that they would not submit to direct and in-
ternal taxation, but if it were attempted would
resort even to arms to resist it. The war has
taught us a different lesson, and that is that
the people will bear direct taxation most pa-
tiently ; that it is the most prolific source of
revenue, and when wisely imposed bears less
heavily than the tariff mode of taxation upon
the industries of the country. And every legis-
lator knows that dircct and internal revenues
may be so imposed as to bear heavily on capi-
tal and lightly on labor and the agricultural
interests. Such a policy would reverse the
present order of things. It would or could be
made to transfer the capital of the East to the
pockcts of the farmers and planters of the
West and South. It would thus accomplish a
sort of poetical justice. Long years of wrong
and injustice could be thus avenged. This
idea may take root and fructify. The farmers
and planters of the West and South, and the
merchants, another great interest whose capi-
tal and labor add to the value of commodities
in transit from the producer to the consumer,
are growing exceedingly restive nnder the
onerous burdens which the protectionists im-
pose upon them; and they may raise the
ominous cry of "Down with the tariff! Up
with free trade!"
The advocates of a high tariff should take
warning from the signsof the times, and prepare
themselves for that catastrophe to their system
which is so imminent.
I am happy to observe that the restless con-
dition of the people under the operation of the
heavy taxation imposed upon them, especially
by the tariff, is beginning to manifest itself
even in this Hall. I am glad to see gentlemen
of the Republican party representing agricul-
tural constituencies of the West giving their
support to the great cause of free trade. I
wish 1 could believe it was the result of con-
viction instead of party necessity to save them-
selves from political ostracism by their con-
stituents. If the gentlemen to whom I allude
were sincere they would join the Democratic
party. That is the only party which can inau-
gurate and carry out the policy of free trade.
That policy has ever been a doctrine of the
Democratic party. That party represents the
interests and the classes which are in favor of free
trade—the merchant, the planter, the farmer,
the workingman—while the Republican party
represents the classes in favor of high taxation
and extravagant expenditures; the moneyed
and the privileged classes ; the owners of Gov-
ernment bonds; the owners of national banks ;
the manufacturer, and the iron-master. These
great, and I admit formidable interests lie at
the foundation of the Republican party, and
constitute its bone and gristle, and contribute
to it its very life-blood. Therefore the Repub-
lican party cannot act adverse to those great
interests. If it taxes bonds, the bondholders
and bankers will desert it. If it fails to "pro-
tect" cotton and woolen mauufactux-es and
pig iron, this army of the privileged classes
turn against it. Without their support it can-
not live. Therefore it is impossible for the
Republican party in this House to tax the Gov-
ernment bonds or to repeal the "protective
system" and adopt free trade. Gentlemen
here representing agricultural constituencies
may talk free trade, but they cannot act it in
good faith and successfully until they join the
Democratic party. To that, complexion must
every true and sincere free-trader come at last.
The policy of the Democratic party is low tax-
ation, economical expenditure, and the eman-
cipation of industry by the policy of free trade.
In conclusion I will say that I have made this
speech in the interest of the merchant, the farm-
er, the mechanic, and the laborer, the four great
classes to whom our country owes so much of
its greatness, its strength, and its grandeur.
Those great classes have reclaimed the forests
and prairies, and converted them into farms and
plantations, teaming with fertility and abund-
ance. They have built our splendid and mag-
nificent cities, our railroads, and our ships of
commerce. All these grand achievements have
sprung from the brain and the muscle of labor,
and in that word I include him who works with
his mind as well as him who toils with his
hands. To these great classes I dedicate this
my humble effort, hoping that they will yet see
that their true interests and the interest of their
country lie in the emancipation of industry from
the trammels, restraints, and fetters throwr.
about it by a selfish and hostile legislation.
