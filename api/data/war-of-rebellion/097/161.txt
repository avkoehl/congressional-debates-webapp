road, by a member of Gregg's (Texas) brigade. Says Pickett was encamped between Field's division and the intermediate line. Guide told him last night after 9 o'clock that both Pickett and Field were under orders to march this morning. He said furthermore that it might amount to nothing, for they had had several such orders lately. Rumors in Richmond were that Sherman had been defeated after a hard battle, but it was not generally believed. The armory is being moved. The naval works are all packed up. Boxes are being sent by the Danville road. All the men who are not engaged in boxing up are making spikes, the men think for the purpose of spiking guns. People in Richmond are discouraged. Many supposed three weeks ago it would be evacuated before this time. Very few believe it will hold out three weeks longer. Provisions are scarce. Flour is $1,500 per barrel since Sheridan cut the canal.
