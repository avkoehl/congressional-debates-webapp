Major-General PARKE:

GENERAL: I desire to know, in case of a movement and the leaving the present lines to be held by the redoubts and pickets, what number of men and guns it would require to hold the redoubts and inclosed batteries now held by you around to the Clements house work? The picket-line in front should be taken from the garrison of the works as far as practicable. Having ascertained the number of men and guns to hold these works and picket in front, I wish to know what force is left in men and guns for operations elsewhere?

Respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
