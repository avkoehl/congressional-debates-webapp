Lieutenant Colonel SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: No train arriving yesterday, and receiving intelligence last night at 10 o'clock from Lieutenant-Colonel Studley that New Berne was attacked, I went up on hand-car after midnight to Newport Barracks, thinking there might be trouble there. Found everything all right. No signs of the enemy in that vicinity. About 5 miles above, at the signal station, a single rail was removed from the track by a small party of rebel cavalry, 12 or 15 in number. The number is verified by different persons. I traced them several miles from the railroad. They passed down last night within 2 miles of the track about 5 p. m. and returned at 8 p. m. Our cavalry companies have been scouting, and no enemy is in that vicinity. Are on the alert all along the line.

Yours, truly,

[A. B. R.] SPRAGUE,

Colonel Fifty-first Massachusetts.

Major-General DIX:
