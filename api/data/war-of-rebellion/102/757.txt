Major J. W. BARNES,

What is the condition of General Spalding's brigade now? What part is equipped and mounted? What portion has been sent men? Where is the rest of it? Where is Cole's regiment, that will be ready by the 9th, stationed? Has Morrill started the rest of Thirteenth Missouri Cavalry for Forts Riley and Larned?

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, June 3, 1865-8 p. m.

Major-General DODGE,Fort Leavenworth:

The brigade organization of General Spalding's brigade is broken up. Twelfth Missouri and Twelfth Tennessee are on their way to Leavenworth. Eleventh Indiana is marching to Rolla. Morrill has not yet sent Thirteenth Missouri to Fort Riley. I instructed him to send them upon arrival of the Eleventh Indiana. Could probably start at once before the Eleventh arrives. Third Illinois is ordered to Saint Paul by General Pope. Colonel Cole's regiment is at Franklin. How do the fish bite?
