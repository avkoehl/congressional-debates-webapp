General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Columbia, S. C.:

GENERAL: I inclose you telegram from General Taylor as to the enemy's movements in his department. All is quiet in our immediate front, no enemy being reported within twenty miles of Aiken. We have no advices from the east, as to the condition of affairs in front of Columbia. Storrs' battalion of artillery has arrived; Johnston's is daily expected. General Young will move this evening toward Orangeburg, and endeavor to feel the enemy's rear. Headquarters were removed yesterday from Montgomery to Macon. Nearly all of General Hood's staff have reached here. I have placed allthe inspectors on duty, having need for them, also the chief quartermaster and assistant commissary. The remainder will remain here for further orders, except Major Moore, chief commissary. He desires a leave of absence to visit Richmond, which I declined granting him, and directed him to report to yu as soon as practicable. He is a most valuable and efficient officer. I do not think he had equal, and as I do not know your wishes, I have directed him to you.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
