APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
475
41st Cong....2d Sess.
Harbor and River Appropriations—Mr. Ganger,
Ho. of Reps.
why not have one short, simple, within your
clear powers, and withal as little as possible
in conflict with the ideas and traditions of the
people ? Such alaw would have met slightorno
opposition here. It would enforce itself, without
your unheard-of apparatus of pains and pen-
alties—your Army and Navy at every polling
place. Why will you insist on an act which in
its largest operations is clearly unconstitu-
tional under the Constitution as you yourselves
have made it by amendment? Ts your habit of
breaking the Constitution so fixed that at, the
first opportunity you hasten to lay violent hands
upon your own amendment? Like Saturn of
old you are hungry to devour your own chil-
dren as soon as they are born.
I shall not say a word in reply to the speecli
of the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Stewart]
on the Chinese question in California, made
by him after I arose, when I yielded to him
to say a word in reply to the Senator from
Oregon, [Mr. Williams.] That is a question
of considerable dimensions, which, as even he
seems to be conscious, is by no means an easy
one to deal with. I trust that the Senate will
at this time confine itself to the subject which
it has before it—the consideration of the bills
to enforce the fifteenth amendment. If there
is to be a law for that purpose, then it is very
clear that the first section of the House bill so
amended as to provide for the case of registra-
tion and the listing upon tax and poll lists pre-
vious to the election, covers everything you
have any right or color of right to deal with
under the fifteenth amendment or the Consti-
tution; and all and more than is required to
enforce the amendment in its letter and spirit.
Harbor and Biver Appropriations.
SPEECH OF HON. 0. D. CONGER,
OF MICHIGAN,
In the House of Representatives,
June 13, 1870,
On the bill (ii. 11. No. 2092) making appropriations
for the repair, preservation, and completion of
certain public works on rivers and harbors, and for
other purposes, for the year ending June SO, 1871.
Mr. CONGER. Mr. Speaker, the bill for the
improvement of the rivers and harbors of the
United States, and for the examination and
purvey of new routes of commerce and har-
borsof lefuge, now under consideration, appro-
priates from the Treasury §3,518,000, distrib-
uted among thirty-two States, and embracing
one hundred and thirty public works for either
improvement or survey, all of which are be-
lieved by the Committee on Commerce to be
of sufficient local or national importance to
justify the expenditure and commend the bill
to the favorable consideration of Congress and
the approval of the country.
Thecommittee during this entire session of
Congress has devoted its time almost daily to
the careful consideration of the innumerable
interests involved in this subject committed to
its care. They have examined the elaborate
reports of the engineer department, the res
olutions of State Legislatures, the recommend-
ations of commercial conventions, the sug-
gestions of boards of trade, the memorials
and petitions of thousands of citizens, the mul-
titude of bills and resolutions referred to them
by the House, and have received deputations
and beard the suggestions of citizens from all
parts of the country; and if I maybe permit-
ted t,o mention as an additional evidence of
their fidelity and the trial of their patience,
they have been subiected from day to day to
the" urgency of zealous Senators and watchful
Representatives, whose patriotic vision, like
•'the eye of one who slumbers notnorsleeps,"
have watched with commendable keenness over
the interests of their 1 rusting constituencies.
I will not presume to say, Mr. Speaker, that
the committee has made the best or most ad-
vantageous distribution of the limited amount
of moneys which the present financial condition
of" the country will suffer to be appropriated
at this time from the Treasury for the protec-
tion and extension of ourvast ocean and inland
commerce and navigation; but I will say that
whatever information and knowledge could he
acquired by zeal, industry, and patience to
assist in forming the judgment and arriving
at conclusions the committee have conscien-
tiously endeavored to secure ; and they submit
the result of their best endeavor to the House
and the country.
The commerce of a nation has in all ages of
history been the measure of its civilization,
progress, and power. The distribution of the
producrs and industries of the world by land
and sea, at home and abroad, being within
the control of any nation, is the sure indica-
tion of empire and the unerring precursor of
supremacy.
Our locality, the genius of our people, the
expansive character of our institutions, the
universality of our freedom, the traditions of
our ancestry, the unreluctant homage yielded
to labor and industry and enterprise, the keen
inquisitiveness and acquisitiveness of a people
combined of the best elements aud the accumu-
lated energies of all the civilized nations of
the earth, the discoveries and appliances of
the age, and the triumphant progress of a re-
united people all uuitein heralding the approach
of American supremacy over the American
continent, and a controlling influence over the
destinies of the world.
The restless energies that lately shook the
foundations of civilized Governments and mar-
shaled the giant strength of American man-
hood in the struggle of conflicting opinions
shall henceforth unite in the more glorious
emulation of constructing an empire of civil-
ization, fraternity, and humanity; of extend-
ing commerce, of ennobling industry, of ad-
vancing science, of equalizing the advantages
of wealth, of rendering our vast territory
accessible to the settlement of our own people
and to the immigration of the oppressed and
liberty-loving wanderer from every land and
from every clime.
Sir, I cannot doubt the teachings of all past
history, that commerce, in its more enlarged
sense, controls the world ; nor will I permit
myself to doubt that the wisdom of our legis-
lation, the advantages of our locality, and the
genius of our people will secure to this nation
that controlling commerec, and that this cen
tury will realize American supremacy. 1 find
sotpe remarks in a new weekly paper, whose
motto is " Upward and Onward," so much in
harmony with my views on this subject, and so
tersely and happily expressed, that I shall give
pleasure to the House by a quotation :
" England can scarccly hope to ever become tho
supreme Power of tho*eastern continent. Prussia,
perhaps, does consider herself in the proper position
to ultimately absorb Africa and the remainder of
Jiuropc and Asia. Every movement indicates a gen-
eral purpose in that direction. No desperate ven-
tures are made, still no opportunities are lost, and
tioui these we judge what her policy is. _ Russian
supreiuaev would be a consistent conclusion could
the fact of the rapid diffusion of principles, antag-
onistic to monarchical, bo left out of the question.
Considered as it necessarily must ho, the legitimate
conclusion is entirely (liflerent. England is diffus- j
ing her influence in eveiy possible direction, but is 1
not gaining home strength thereby. Russia is grad-
ually absorbing the countries adjoining her, while
all other European countries are cither decaying or
approaching a popular form oi government. The
United States alone, of all countries of the world,
has continuous streams of strength flowing to her
heart, which streams are tho contributions of nearly
every other countiy of the world to her present
inherent <=tren?th, and which arc their involuntary
recognitions ol supremacy."
Mr. Speaker, the policy of making appro-
priations from the Treasury for improving the
rivers and harbors of the United States has
been adopted so long, aud continued so per-
sistently with the sanction of Congress and the
approval of the people, that the few excep-
tions may be said to prove the rule. This sys-
tem of national improvement was beguu in
1824, and continued under every administia-
tion, with the exception of the term of Penns\ 1
vania's favorite son, until the present time;
although in justice to the record I should st.ite
that Polk's administration, by a slight apjco
priation, barely escaped dividing the honors
with President Buchanan.
The whole amount of money thus appiopr.
ated, as near as I have been able to ascertain,
up to and including, for my purposes, the
amount in the bill now before the House, is
about twenty-seven million eight hundred and
eighty-six thousand and sixteen dollars and
(hirty-one cents, distributed among thirty-three
States and allotted for survey or improve
rnents, or both, to over one hundred and fifty
different rivers, harbors, and public works of
that description.
Mr. Speaker, in the following table, which
I have prepared for the information of the
House with as much accuracy as the material
at my disposal would permit, it will be seen
that very large expenditures were mado within
the limits of particular States for public works
equally as beneficial to otlier States as to the
State charged with the expenditure. Among
these are the Delaware breakwater, the St.
Clair flats, the Sault Ste. Marie Falls canal,
the Des Moines rapids the mouth of the Mis-
sissippi river, Hell Gate, and the Illinois and
Wisconsin rivers. Aud with this explanation
I ask the attention of tho House to the fol-
lowing statement of expenditure of public
money in the several States on rivers, harbors,
&c., from 1824 to 1870, inclusive:
