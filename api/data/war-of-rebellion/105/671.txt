Adjutant-General THOMAS, U. S. Army,

Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: There has been established a new camp, garrisoned by four companies of First Infantry California Volunteers, near Warner's ranch, on the road hence to Fort Yuma, Cal. It is called Camp Wright and is commanded by Major Edwin A. Rigg, First Infantry California Volunteers. The companies are Company D, Captain Hugh A. Gorley; Company E, Captain Thomas L. Roberts; Company F, Captain Washington L. Parvin; Company H, Captain Henry A. Greene, First Infantry California Volunteers. Please send to that camp and those companies blank post returns, blank company returns, and such other blank rolls, returns, books, orders, &amp;c., as are necessary. The nearest post-office is San Diego, Cal.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First California Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,Los Angeles, Cal., October 22, 1861.

Major RICHARD C. DRUM, U. S. Army,

Assistant Adjutant-General, San Francisco, Cal.:

MAJOR: I last evening received a telegram from you in these words: "The troops at Fort Yuma will sail from San Diego as directed on the 1st of November. By order," &c. The commander of the department, General Wright, is aware that it will be impossible for the troops at Yuma to be relieved and reach San Diego by the 1st proximo, so I conclude the telegram is incorrectly reported here; that the original reads "as directed on the 1st of October. " I have reprots of great scarcity of water on the desert. I have sent an express to Colonel West and to Colonel Andrews, with letters in relation to the passage of the desert, copies of which I herewith inclose. Would it not be well to send down, say, ten more teams? This would save the necessity of hiring transportation in all ordinary movements of troops, or for post purposes. The mules could be kept as cheaply here, perhaps, as above, and if they are on hand, and not required in the upper country, I would like to have them, but not if they have to be purchased.

Respectfully, &c.,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First California Volunteers, Commanding.
