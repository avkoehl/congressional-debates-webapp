HEADQUARTERS AQUIA DISTRICT,.

Fredericksburg, March 14, 1862.

General R. E. LEE, Commanding Army:.

GENERAL: Since the withdrawal of Generals Whiting and French from Evansport and its vicinity the enemy have crossed the river in large force, and have also advanced from the direction of Manassas as far as Brentsville. This would seem to indicate that their efforts against Richmond will be via Fredericksburg. Last night I called Generals Whiting and French and Colonels Hampton and Pettigrew in consultation. These gentlemen had served all the fall and winter between Aquia and the Occoquan, and were thus perfectly conversant with the country and everything belonging to its defense. The unanimous result of the conference was-

1st. Fredericksburg per se is untenable; it can only be defended by a force strong enough to attack the enemy's advance north of the Rappahannock..

2nd. The present disposition of the enemy's forces would seem to indicate that his advance will be in three columns, i. e., from Manassas, Evansport, and from below Potomac Creek. The two first are most serious, and if they move simultaneously absolutely necessitates the assistance of our main body to the force now about Fredericksburg; and this assistance should be given as soon as it is ascertain there is no mistake in this programme. You are aware that the Fredericksburg there is a large depot, well supplied with everything necessary for troops, which, independently of the interests of its noble, zealous, and true hearted people, makes its preservation and defense a matter of much importance, and which can only be effected by winning a battle before the enemy arrive, the town being perfectly commanded by the heights on the opposite bank of the river..

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,.

PREFACE.

By an act approved June 23, 1874, Congress made an appropriation "to enable the Secretary of War to begin the publication of the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, both of the Union and Confederate Armies," and directed him "to have copied for the Public Printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order."

Appropriation for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16, 1880, has provided "for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10,000 copies of a compilation of the Official Records (Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year"; and that "of said number, 7,000 copies shall be for the use of the House of Representatives, 2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, and 1,000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments."

This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.

The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:

The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence, orders, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed, is to be accompanied by an Atlas.

In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &amp;c., not embraced in the "reports" proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate) in chronological order.

The 2nd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners.

The 3rd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specially to the subjects of the first and second series. It will set forth the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in-Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities..

The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and Confederate authorities given in that series.
