APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[April 30,
Ho. of Reps.
The Tariff—Mr. Roberts.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
Charcoal represents unskilled industry, so
does the ore in its digging and separating
and casting. The gentleman from Missouri
would include as labor only the hammering of
the iron. But repairs and carting and freight
to market are labor. So in a different place
the oil is the product of labor. In this calcu-
lation nothing is put down for the use of capi-
tal. The labor in the iron aggregates $81 18 a
ton, and it has sold at from $80 to $83 per ton.
Such facts show why great reductions in duties
must affect labor seriously; and they appeal
to prudent men, regardless of theories, to make
haste slowly in reductions upon the manufac-
tures which are the life-blood of our prosperity.
duties and prices.
The remarks of the gentleman from Illinois
[Mr. Bup.chard] lead to another suggestion.
All money taken by the Government from the
people is a burden. Internal taxes are paid
directly, and always add to the cost of the
article taxed. The tax on tobacco works this
result. The person-who pays the tax charges
for interest, for risk, for profit, and so the
consumer must pay more than the Government
receives. The gentleman from Virginia [Mr.
PiAtt] argued before the committee that the
consumers pay in the aggregate twice the
nominal rate of the tax.
With duties on articles which we cannot
produce, the case is substantially the same.
All that the Government, levies must come
out of our own people.
Upon articles which we can and do produce
the effect varies. Sometimes the competition
is so sharp that all the dnty is paid by the for-
eign producer, who puts down his charges in
order to rule the market. Sometimes it will
answer his purpose to yield only a part of the
duty, leaving the consumer to undergo the
remainder. In other cases all the duty is
charged upon the consumer. The more nearly
our manufacturers attain to an equality of pro-
duction with those of other lands, the larger
is the share of the duty accepted by our for-
eign rivals as one of the elements of cost in
their exportations to this country. When all
the duty is charged upon the consumer, and
articles of the same class are manufactured
in this country, it does not always follow
that the price of the latter is advanced by
the duty. Take woolen fabrics for exam-
ple. Foreign goods rule at a higher price
than Apierican. The price of the latter is
affected somewhat by foreign competition, but
more by competition of our own producers.
Some consumers will buy foreign cloths at
any price. You may purchase a suit of Amer-
ican goods for twenty-five to thirty dollars;
made of foreign fabrics a like suit will cost
fifty to seventy-five dollars. Then the price
of the former is not increased by the duty.
Take, again, Bessemer steel rails, so clear an
example that it cannot be too often cited. The
price of the foreign article in 1864 was $102
in gold per ton. Americans began to make
the rails, and the price of llie British product
fell to $120, then to $110, and for awhile to
$80 per ton. The purpose, of course, was in
accord with Lord Brougham's teachings, "by
the glut to stifle the rising manufacture."
Only the duty prevented that result, but it has
given us the rails at $105 a ton instead of
$162.
So a gentleman from Brooklyn, New York,
testified before our committee that he makes
jute thread and the foundation for oil-cloths.
As soon as he put his articles on the mar-
ket in 1869 the foreign manufacturers carried
their prices here down one or two per cent.; and
he exhibited a circular showing that the for-
eign dealers make a standing offer to sell
below his list of prices.
Such cases, in glass and other manufactures,
are too numerous to mention.
Mr. Edward Atkinson, in a paper submitted
to the committee, at the request of Edward
Harris, admits that the effect has been the
same upon the duties on wool and woolens.
His words are :
"It may be that both wool and cloth may be abso-
lutely lower in price than before the enactment of
the tariff, as some kinds have lately been." Page 9.
"Hence, it has happened that under the highest
tariff ever enacted we have had the largest import-
ation of woolen goods ever known, coupled for a
time with lower prices for wool than have prevailed
for many years."—Page 10.
"Instead of preventing a decline in the price
of home-grown wool, this tariff actually caused
one."—Page 10.
Yet gentlemen urge, as an axiom, that a
tariff increases the cost of all dutiable articles
by the full amount of the duty, and adds a like
sum to the cost of all articles of the same
class produced and consumed in this country;
it is an absurdity none the less because it is
the foundation of the theories of the advocates
of British policy. Let me burrow the illustra-
tion, which is so complete, of the honorable
gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kelley.]
If the pretense is true of all dutiable arti-
cles, it is true of grains. Adopting the lan-
guage of the doctrinaires, the duty on grains
puts $1,055,295 80 into the Treasury, and
$179,336,851 37 into the pockets of " monop-
olists," (in this case the farmers,) taken from
the_ pockets of consumers in added cost of
grains. Here is the calculation:

Mr. Chairman, this pretense is the sort of
stuff which is put into school-books and passes
for science. The facts make it ridiculous.
Put a little sturdy thought in the place of
mere theory, look facts in the face, and it
will be clear that aduty is an element of added
cost, chargeable on the article alone into
which it enters and circumstances will determ-
ine whether it shall come, in whole or in
part, from the profits of the producer, or fall in
whole or in part on the consnmer. When the
supply greatly exceeds the demand the duty
will all fall on the producer. When the de-
mand is greater than the supply the duty is
cast upon the purchaser. As a law of trade,
if production be increased by a tariff or other
means, other things remaining equal, the price
must fall. Duties wisely adjusted will bring
production to the maximum, and will therefore
always tend to bring down the prices of the
protected article. Hence we hear the plea of
the consumer against prostrating our manu-
facturers by slashing reductions of the tariff
which can redound only to the advantage of
their foreign rivals.
protests against warfare oh manufactures.
While, therefore, we should lift the burdens
of internal taxation, and should do all we can
to cheapen the comforts of life, many voices
unite to protest against legislative warfare
against American manufactures. The oldest
nations teach us to foster home production
if we would secure long national life. The
example of Britain warns us to beware of a
merely commercial policy. Our own prosper-
ity appeals to us to adhere to the path in which
it has been secured. The gifts of nature plead
for development. Agriculture asserts itself
against the weakness inherent in any exclusive
pursuit and demands the alliance of manufac-
tures on the soil. The consumer refuses tc
be placed naked at the mercy of the foreigner.
Capital protests against invasion of vested
rights. Above and beyond all, American
labor, fairly paid, thrifty, intelligent, and so
far as is given to mortals contented and happy
in its achievements, stands for its rights. Chal-
lenging competition on equal grounds, it asks
legislators not to degrade it, and to think twice
before enacting statutes to cripple its strength
or to diminish its glories.
seduction for intkrn'al taxes repealed.
The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Fixk-
elxbuiig] justifies the standard of reduction
proposed by the fact that on certain articles
the duty was increased by ten per cent, to
counterbalance the internal taxes. He argues
that the repeal of those taxes should be fol-
lowed by reduction of duties. Concede every-
thing else to be equal, and this follows. But
the reduction must not exceed the increase on
this account, and that was ten per cent.
This is the reduction on manufactured arti-
cles, which, where it has not already been
made, or where exceptional circumstances do
not exist, the committee and the House should
concede. We should stop at that figure on
manufactures and make greater modifications
elsewhere.
a question of practical sagacity.
How to perfect this bill is a question of
practical sagacity, and not of mere theory.
No partisan can deny the rapid growth of our
industries, nor for many years will he dare to
sweep away altogether the duties which gen-
erations have enacted into a system. That
rapid growth contributes to our financial inde-
pendence. The friends of an American tariff
can afford to take the lead in true revenue
reform. They will secure permanence of
duties by gradual moderation of duties. This
country is to-day the first producer of wool
on earth, and our increase of production is to
Continue. We can in our acquired strength
yield something for our own advantage. In
iron, and especially in steel, we are beginning
to achieve a portion of the benefits which
nature designed for us. In cotton our progress
is cheering in all parts of the country. Amer-
ican mechanism is keen-eyed, quick fingered,
apt at using every power of nature and of ma-
chinery. It gains year by year in the sharp
fight of competition.
Our munificent revenues permit reduction;
it should be made in the interest of our own
people, and especially of the producing classes.
Our tariff covers eight hundred and seventy-
three enumerated articles; a hundred and
