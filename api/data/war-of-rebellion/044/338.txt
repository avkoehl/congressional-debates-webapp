Return of Casualties in the Army of Northern Virginia, at the battle of Gettysburg, July 1-3.

[Where the sum of the regimental losses does not tally with the brigade"totals, " the discrepancy is due to disagreements between the detailed statement furnished by Surg. L. Guild, medical director of the army, and the numbers reported by brigade and other superior commanders. Owing to the absence of subordinate reports, such disagreements cannot be explained. In computing the "grand total, " the figures supplied by brigade, division, and corps commanders have generally been adopted; but, whether taken in detail or as a whole, the compilation can only be regarded as approximative. Several of the reports indicate that many of the "missing" were killed or wounded . Especially is this the case with Pickett's division of Longstreet's corps.
