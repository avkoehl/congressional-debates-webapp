APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1844.
88th Cong.. ..1st Sess.
Appropriation Hill—Mr. Peyton.
H. of Reps.
New York, [Mr. Davis,] by the member from New Hamp
shire, [Mr. Burke,] and, at the commencement of this ses-
sion, by my colleague, [Mr. Reynolds ] Coming thus from
members ofthat party from every quarter of the Union, and
from every section of the party, the country has much rea-
son to apprehend that this will be another of the experi-
ments of that party upon the institutions and established
usages of the country."
The gentleman from Louisiana, [Mr. Sudf.ll,] in his
speech on the tariff, told us how superior this system of di-
rect taxation was to all other systems, but concluded that it
was unpopular now, and, of course, "out of the question."
Hear what he said on this subject:
"Of all the modes of raising revenue, direct taxation, in
the shape of a uniform per centage upon every species of
property, real and personal, or upon income, is probably the
most equitable that could be devised. It is the only means
by which the ricl^ can be made to pay their fair quota
for the support of the government which protects them in
the enjoyment of their property. It is certainly the system
'which would,ensure the most economical administration;
tor all experience shows that a heavy indirect taxation is
jnore cheerfully submitted to than a more moderate direct
one. The same person who cheerfully, because uncon-
sciously, pays dollars, injhe shape of the -enhanced price
caused by imposts on articles of daily necessary consump-
tion, would receive most ungraciously the visit of the na-
tional tax-gatherer for a much smaller sum; and in propor-
tion to the grudging reluctance with which he paid the tax
wou)d be the watchlu^ scrutiny with which would criticise
its expenditure.
"But, superior as the system may be in theory, there are
many and fatal objections to it in practice. It would in-
crease ten-told the already dangerous and enormous patron-
age of the federal government; it would, indeed, render its
influence all-pervading and |irresistibie. It would interfere
"with the peculiar sources of revenue of the States. It is op-
posed to the opinions, feelings, and prejudices of the people;
and I am one of those who think that even their prejudices
should be respected by a sage legislator. There is, how-
ever, one conclusive answer to the suggestion of direct tax-
ation; if the alternative were presented to the people, cer-
tainly there is no State, probably not a district, in the Union,
where amajority could be found in its favor. Whatever ad-
vance may hereafter be made in public opinion on this sub-
ject, direct taxation is, for the present, out of the question "
His colleague had approached this subject very cautious-
ly} said he was no advocate for direct taxation, but he argu-
ed for,it very strongly—a little stronger, no doubt, than his
co-laborers m this deep, subtle game, thought was altogeth-
er prudent. But this was perhaps attributable to the warmth
and excitement of debate, and an absence of that control
over himself which a few years here might give him, and
which might teach him a practical application of Talley-
rand's definition of language: that it was designed to con-
ceal men's thoughts. How can be fail to be an advocate
of a policy that, he says, will save the country millions,
and Tennessee several hundred thousands of dollars: which
will prevent wild and corrupt expenditures of the pub-
lic treasure, and which is to prevent ruinous, in-
iquitous, and oppressive taxation upon the mechanics and
laboring classes of society? What! (he observed) are we
to.be taught a system that will spread far and wide such in-
valuable blessings as these, and yet our teachers shrink
back, and tell us that they are no advocates of such a sys-
tem? There is something secret, hidden, mysterious, in this
—"something rotten in Denmark." The pear is not yet ripe;
the democracy have never yet been sufficiently firm set in
power to venture upon this odious system oi direct taxa-
tion, or we should have had the practice as well as the theo-
ry long since. Mr P. said his colleague had attempted to
show, by a calculation, that Tennessee contributes $1,700,-
000 to the national treasury. He would say, for the sake of
the argument, that it was one million. That State already
paid three direct taxes—the State tax, of about $100,000:
the county tax, and a corporation tax. In the name of all
that's charitable, (said Mr. P.,) was this not direct taxation
enough? Would the people of that State submit to an addi-
tional direct tax of $1,000,000? How was Tennessee to pay
this immense sum? Mr. P. said he would give the plan as
proposed by two of Governor Polk's organs in Tennessee.
Here is that of the Jackson Republican:
Jtevenue from mules and horses ♦ ♦ ♦ $2,000,000
Do neat cattle - 1,000,000
Do sheep   500,000
Do swine .... 200,000
Do land ♦ 1:2,000,000
Do slaves t - • r 4,000,000
Total
• 20,200,000
The Governor's organ, (Columbia Democi'at,) in his
own town, had said: "Our interest is the same, wheth-
er the revenue is raised by direct taxes upon our prop-
erty, or by import duties upon the goods we consume." By
this system, it was clear that the tax would fall principally
upon the farmer, whilst the rich capitalist, who Jives upon
his money, "clothes in ihie linen and purple," and drinks his
foreign wines, was not taxed at all Mr. P. said the aystum
of indirect taxation, or the tariff system, was the lightest,'
th-2 most equal and just, that the wit of man had ever con-
ceived of. By it, none paid the tax but those who consumed
the goods. This was voluntary; the other (direct taxation)
was involuntary. The tax must be paid by the farmer,
whether he consumed foreign goods or not; and the plain
cottager, who dressed in the "homespun," made by the
hands of his thrifty wile, was doomed to pay a tax for the
support of the general government, upon his land, negroes,
cattle, &c., while the man of money, who has no ostensible
taxable property, goes freo.
Mr. P continued. The system we now had was given to
us l v our forefathers, and he trusted in God that it would
ji -ver be changed. Sir, said he, let any administration at-
t .jjpt to saddle a system of direct taxation upon the people
ol this country in a time of profound peace, and you will
bee such a commotion as no man ever beheld in this land
before. It would shake the continent to its centre, and
would probably end in revolution, anarchy, and civil war.
Jie did not recollect any attempt to levy a direst tax for thv
support of the general government in fime-of peace, since
that which produced the rebellion in Pennsylvania. All,
no doubt, recollected the whiskey tax, which was so stout-
ly resisted by the honest Dutch of the Keystone State. They
resisted until the government arrayed itself in arms against
them; the militia were called out, and they were con-
pelled to yield to the superior forces of the federal govern-
ment. Yes, sir, (said Mr. P.,) and whenever it was attempt-
ed to collect the vast revenues of this great nation by direct
taxation upon the people, you will find that not only the
Dutch of Pennsylvania, but the Irish, Scotch, French, and
natives, every man that had an American heart in his breast,
w«u Id resist it, and resist it to the knife, and the "knife to the
hilt," • - - ~
He asked, why were we called on to change our present
admirable system for this odious mode of direct taxation?
We now collect the taxes which support this government
by duties on foreign goods, imported into this country, prin-
cipally from England, France, and Germany. And who is
benefited, if we give up the tariff and adopt direct taxation?
These foreign nations, of course. They flood our land with
their goods free, break down all our domestic manufactures
and our mechanics, charge us what they please for their
goods, and the prosperity of our farmers and mechanics will
be banished by the onerous direct taxation necessary for the
support of their government. This would be the result of
the free trade, direct taxation policy to which the argu-
ments of his colleague would lead. Free trade, Indeed!
Where is it to be found7 No where, but in the distempered
imaginations of some wild, visionary theorist. It would be
free to foreigners, but how would it be to us? They would
have all the benefit of the trade, while a mere abstraction of
freedom would be left to us, without any of its realities. Do
they give us free trade? Look at their tax upon our staple
agricultural productions; it amounts almost to prohibition.
They tax our tobacco 1,000 per cent; England levies a duty
of more than "$20,000,000 on our tobacco. Yes, sir, if a
farmer from this country sends $100 worth of tobacco to
England, the tax on it is $1,000. And yet we are
called upon to open our ports to England and all the
world—to invite them to come—come one, come all, and
fill our land with foreign goods, and you shall not be
charged one cent for the privilege Sir, (said Mr. P.,) this
would look like there was springing up among us a foreign
party, in favor of foreign governments, and opposed to our
own. It would seem to him that they could not have
American hearts in their breasts, and advocate such doc-
trines. They had been "misborn," and ought to be trans-
ported be) ond the Atlantic, to more congenial climes and
governments, among kings and queens and princes and
potentates, where aprivileged class "are born booted and
spurred, ready to ride the people legitimately by the grace
of God."
His colleague had said that no nation could prosper with
the balancc of trade against it. Let us see how this free-
trade system, or that which had approached more nearly to
it than anything we have had in the last quarter of a cen-
tury, had operated. The compromise act brought the du-
ties down to a horizontal rate of 20 per cent. And wheti we
were rapidly approaching that low rate of duty, what did
Mr. Woodbury, Mr. Van Buren's great State financier, say
in his report of 1840? Here it is:
"The difference between our exports arid imports has
usually been in favor of the latter. Several years ago it
ranged that way about seven millions of dollars annually;
but, of late, the average has risen to near twenty millions
annually; the excess of imports having been, in 1836 even,
$61,316,995, and in 1839, $41,063,716."
By this statement, it appeared that in 1836 the balance of
trade against us was upwards of $61,000,000, and in 1839
upwards of $41,000,000. Was there any wonder that we
had been involved in a debt of $200,000,000 to foreign coun-
tries? In the short space of two years, our imports ex-
ceeded our exports by $102,000,000. Sir, Said Mr. P., this
•was the result of a two-fold cause—the low tariff, inviting
the goods of all foreign governments to our shores: and
the "pet bank svstem," which stimulated credit to the high-
est possible pitch, and literally set the country on ftre with
the spirit of speculation. Who was responsible for this
tremendous expansion of the credit system? The self-styled
democratic party. For ten years preceding their war upon
the United States Bank there had been only twenty-two
State banks chartered in the United States, with a capital of
about $8,000,000. In 1S30, the banking capital of the whole
country was only $110,000,000, and the number of banks
was about threo hundred. In 1837, the number .of banks
had increased to 677, with an aggregate capital of $378,-
000,000.
Here Mr. P. exhibited the political complexion of the legis-
latures which had chartered those hanks, by 'the following
• table: [Se€ next column.']
And by whose counsel and advice were the legislatures
of the States stimulated, encouragcd, and almost com-
manded, to engage in the race of competition which could
charter the most banks and issue the largest quantity of
bank paper? Let this cncular of Mr. Taney, General Jack-
son's Secretary of the Treasury, and tlu-se extracts from
the Globe, the organ of the then administration, answer the
question:
Circular of the Secretary of the Treasury to the De-
posite Banks.
"Tri. v^cry Dh.pari.mf.si, Sept. 26, 1833
"Sir: The Girard Bank has been selected by this depart-
ment as the depository of the public money collected in
Philadelphia and its vicinity.
"The deposites of the public money will enable yon to
afford increased, facilities to commerce, and to extend j our
accommodations to individuals; and, as the duties which are
payable to the Gu\eminent itnse from the business and en-
terprise of tlie merr-hants engaged m foreign trade, it is but
reasonable that they should be preferred m the additional
accommodations which the public deposites will enable
your institutions to give, whenever it can be done w itliout
injustice to the claims of other classes of the community.
"I am, &.c.
"R. B. TANEY,
"Secretary of the Treasury.
"The President of the Girard Bank,
"Philadelphia,"
the Globe of December 21,1832.
"The intelligent people of the West know how to main-
tain their rights ana independence, and to repel oppression.
Although foiled in the beginning, every western State is
about to establish a State bank institution. They are resolv-
ed to avail themselves of their own State credit, as well as
of the national credit, to maintain a currency independent
of foreign control."
And again:
"So Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kentucky, are
resolved to take care of themselves."
And yet again, in connexion with the" debts and expendi-
tures of Pennsylvania, the Globe says:
"Why should not she establish a bank of a large capital,
in which she should be interested as the principal stock-
holder? Such a bank, especially if the faith of the State
were pledged for the redemption of its paper, would com-
mand universal confidence, and would doubtless become the
depository of the public funds accumulated in Philadel-
phia."
Now (said Mr. P.,) we can clearly see how it was that the
country has been involved in a debt to foreigners of $200,-
000,000. It has been by the double stimulus of a low tariff
and a flood of bank paper. If an individual buys more than
he sells, he becomes involved in debt and embarrassment.
It is so with a nation. If more goods are brought into the
country than are sent out, the balance must be paid in spe-
cie, or its equivalent in the staple products of tne country.
Fortunately for our country, by the beneficial operation of
the present tariff, the trade has been turned in our favor;
and, instead of an annual balance against uss of $40,000,000,
or $60,000,000, the commercial document, which will soon
be published, will exhibit about $26,000,000 in our favor,
and $20,000,000 "of that in specie. Official document's show
that the importations-of specie for the last year were $23,-
000,000, and the exports-$3,000,000—a clear balance in ourfa-
vor.in specie, ol $20,000,000. Mr P. said he called upon eveiy
farmer and mechanic and professional man throughout the
-whole land to bear witness to this happy result of. the tariff.
And this, said he, is the system that the democratic party,
as they call themselves, with Japnes K. Polk at their head,
would break down, and let in a ficod of trash from foreign
countries, in the shape of goods, ruin our domestic manu-
factures, and involve the country again in debt and irretriev-
able embarrassment. Governor Polk is opposed torfhe pro-
tective tariff. He is for reducing it to what it was when
the whigs came in power—to a horizontal ad valorem duty
of20 per cent. This was the gentleman who did vote a
tax on tea and coffee in 1832, when the treasury was over-
flowing with an annual surplus of $6,000,000, yet, when the
revenue was reduced to about one-half of the annual expen-
diture, under the compromise act, he was opposed to in-
creasing the tariff', and is now bitterly opposed to the tariff'of
1842, as is every organ in his interest m Tennessee. They
denounce it as the "black tariff," as a system of plunder,
by which the poor are robbed for the benefit of the rich
manufacturer and capitalist. The country will judge be-
tween the two systems of policy. Under the one, we have
passed through a terrible ordeal of many years of suffering,
of deep, universal distress. Under the other the country
has risen up, refreshed and vigorous, like a strong man
from sleep; every interest, every branch of industry, is re-
viving and prospering beyond .anything that we have wit-
nessed for many long years; and, with steadiness in the pre-
sent tariff policy, and the re-establishment of a sound na-
