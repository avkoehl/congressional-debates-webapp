CAIRO, April 23, 1864-noon.

Colonel ANSON STAGER,

Captain Bush, commanding at Smithland, Ky., reports rebels commenced crossing Tennessee River at Birmingham and above at 8 p.m. yesterday, and were still crossing when his informant left Chandet's early this morning. Wire is cut between Smithland and Fort Donelson.

W. J. MASON,

Have you received the information and taken measures to attend to them?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, April 25, 1864.

(Received at Washington 9.50 p.m.)

General GRANT,

Culpeper:

I have no account of any force crossing the Tennessee. The officer commanding at Fort Donelson reports about 100 men committing depredations between the Cumberland and Tennessee. Boats are constantly ascending and descending, and the Tennessee is closely watched.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CULPEPER, April 25, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Will your veterans be back to enable you to start on the 2nd of May? I do not want to delay later.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., April 25, 1864-11.30 a.m.

(Received 12.40 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

All unassigned troops in Illinois and the Northwest should at once be sent to Cairo in reserve, for they will be needed down the Mississippi or up the Tennessee when, by an advance, we weaken our lines of communication. At Cairo they could be consolidated and organized.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
