I expect you at Varnell's Station to-morrow night. This will be given you by an officer of General McCook's division, who will at the same time uniform you of the results of to-morrow's battle. If you do not hear from me again, act according to the information you can obtain to-morrow night, or on your arrival. Time may by very important in your movements. I will write you again to-morrow if possible.

Brigadier-General McCook, Commanding Cavalry Division:

I inclose a dispatch* for General Stoneman, who is at Charleston to-night and is expected at Varnell's Station to-morrow afternoon. Please send and officer to meet him in the morning and give him information of our present position and the state of affairs generally, and arrange a concert of action with him on his arrival, if I am not able to send him orders after to-morrow's battle. General Sherman expects an attack from Johnston to-morrow, probably on my left flank. I desire you to make a demonstration on the Dalton road at dawn of day in the morning and gain the earliest possible information of any movement of the enemy on my left flank, both at that time and during the day. This is of vital importance.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
