submitted 'o The attempt <-honld not be nude to
ia.>pa&s it, and if passed, it shou'd be repea'ed.
The game is too unequal ior us to submit. We
conquer many times in open contest, and it only
secures us for one Congress. We are conquered
ornee, in a contest without point or principle, and,
immediately, we are to be fettered with the Bank,
and bemad down for twenty years. There is no
fairness'—no equality—in this. We carry the
elections many tunes, and secure no hmg; we
fail once, and lose all. This will never do Nothing
but the repeal remedy will put us on an equality
„withrotir adversaries. If they take advantage of
their accidental victory to bind us down with their
Bank, we must avail ourselves of our first triumph
to repeal their act.
It has been asserted that in electing General
Harrison the people voted for a Bank; that he was
the Bank candidate, lhat in electing him the Bank
was called for, and that we have nothing to do now
but to carry out the popular wish, and establish
the institution. This is what is said by the friends
of the Bank; but it is most untruly and most erro-
neously said, and the fact is incontestable iha', so
far as General Harrison was presented on this
point at all, he was presented as the enem, to the
Bank. This is the fact, and the proof is at hand
It is to be rccollecied that his nominators at Har-
risburg made no professions of principles for him,
and that he himself, in authentic publicaiions, re-
fused to answer any ques ions, or to make any de-
clarations for the publie eye, in!, while doing this,
he referred the public to ins past conduit, and past pro-
fissions, for alt the information which Ahey required.
This was the course which he followed, and, in
pursuing the line which he indica'ed, his confiden-
tial friends made many publications lo apprize the
people ot hi* p lmcal p'inoiples as demonstra'ed
in the previous professions and p'actice of h>s life.
Among the most elaborate and authentic ot these
was the volume of ihe sketches of his life, published
by Mei rs Todd and Drake, his intimate friends,
and selected for that purpose by the Harrison exe-
cutive committee of the county in which the Gene-
ral lived It was published in Ohio, m the pre-
sence oí General Harrison, and was intended to be
the standard publication on which his election
should be s ood. In this work was republished,
the answer of General Harrison to the questions
ot Mr Sherrod Williams, in the summer of 1836,
and which answer was ihus made the en enon of
his piinciples in 1840 I hold lhat volume m my
hand, and shall read from it what relates to a Na-
lional Bank for the purpose of showing, first, that
General Harrison was. opposed to a Nationa' Bank,
secondly, that he repulsed as an injurious imputa-
tion, the suggestion that he was ihe Bank and Fe-
deral candidate, thirdly, lhat he was in fa i or of
giving a fair trial to the experiment of carrying on
ihe financial operations ot the Government without
a National Bank, fourthly, that he was not com-
mitted to any course in relation to chanermg such
a Bank, andfijMy, that he would only aeree to
f>>gn a charter on the happening ot two conditions,
nenber of which have yet occurred.
Mr. B. then read from page 146, and the subse-
quent pages, as follows

evidence at least, that the opposition which I gave to their insti

those of the fourteenth Congress, willehow mat my votes are

of Ohio, to procure a ref eal of the law which had imposed an
enormous tax upon the branches which had been loc ued in its
boundaries at the request of the citizens Thegiound of those
exertions was nut the interest of the Btnk but to save what I
considered the honor oí the State, md to prever t a controversy

said, this was notthe purpose for which the meeting was called,

to give an opinion, but in the event of an equal divison of the
votes

"I have this statement to show you that I am. not committed
to any other course m relation to th* chartering of a Bank
of the United States, and that 1 might, if so disposed join in
the popular cry of denunciation against the old institution, and
upon its misconduct, predicate an opposition to the chartering
ol another
' I shall not, however, take th s course, so opposite to that
which I hope I have followed through life but «ill give you
my sentiments clearly and fully, not only with regard to th- fu
tuie conduct ol the Government on the subject of a National
Bank but in relation to the operation of that which isnowde
funct
"I was not in Congiess when the late Bank was chartered,
but was a member of the thirteenth Congress, aftei ltsfirstses
sion, when the conduct ofthe Bank, in its incipient measures,
was examined into, and believing, from the result ofthe investí
gation, that the charter had been violated I voted for the judi
cial investigation, with a view of annulling its charter The
resolution loi that purpose¡ however failed, and shortly after
the management of its aflans was committed to the talents and
integrity ol Mr Cheves Fiom that period to its final dissolu
tion, (although I must confess I am not a very competent judge
of such matters,) I have no idea that an institution could have
been conducted with more ability, integnty, and public advan
tage than it has been
"Under these impicssions, I agree with general Jackson m
the opinion expiessed m one of his messages to Congress, from
which I mak the lollowing extiact That a Bank ofthe
United Slates, competent to alt the duties which inay I e re
quired by the Gooei nment, misht be so organized as not to
infringe on our delegated poweis or the reserved rights oj
the States Ido not entei tain a doubt' But the petiud foi
rechailering the old institution has passed, as Pennsylvania
has wisely taken cam to appropttate to herself the benefits of
its Urge capital
"The question, then, for me to answer, is whether under the
eticumstances you state, ii elected to the office of Piesident, I
would sign an act to chaiteranother Bank I answer Iicoutd,
if it wei p clearly ascertained that the public interest m rela
tionto the collection and disbuisement of the j evenue would
mateiially suffer without one, and there were uneqiucocal
manifestations of public opinion mils j~aooi I think, how
evci, the experiment should be fairly tried, to ascertain
whether the financial operations of the Government cannot
be as well carried on without the aid of a Natioinal Bank
If it is not necessaty foi that purpose, it does not aj ^r to me
that one can be constitution illy charteied There is 10 con
strut Hon which I can give the Constitution which would au
thonze It on the ground of all >rding/csci/i/tts to commerce

giound fox justifying a. recojrseto it
"1 he excitement which has been produced by the Bank ques
tion, the numbei and ? e^peclabihhj of those who deny the
rtghtto Congress to chartei cne, stiongly recommended the
course above su0gested '
This extract is explicit on the five points which
I have mentioned—too explicit to require com-
ment—md all that I have to say upou them, is,
first, That General Harrison mighi have presented
himself still more strongly against the late Bank;
for, he not only voted, as he says, for the judicial
investigation in 1819, to annul lU charter, but also
for the bill to repeal it without judicial inquiry,
Secondly, That no fair expenment has yet been
made to carry on the Government without the aid
of a National Bank, the Sub Treasury ha mg yet
beei in force but about one year, Thirdly, That th s
experiment has woikcd well, and is now working
well, and f let alone for two or ihree years will
explode th  argument for i Nan mal Bank, and
Fourthly, That neither of ihe contingencies have
yet occurred on which, and which alone, the Gene-
ral agreed to sign a charter, namely, the CLEAR
ascertainment (hat the public interest in relation to
the collec ion and disbursement of the revenue
would MATERIALLY SUFFER without the
Bank; and the uneiíoivocal man fesUtions of
public opinion in favor of one.
UpoE this exhibition of General Hanison,
speaking for himself, and to the American people
in h s character of candidate for ihe Presidency, I
submit, that his election was no lest of the Bank
question: that it is a FRAUD upon the people to
treat it as such: and that it ts a CALUMNY upon
his memory to consider the chartering of a Bank to
have been among the unnamed objects for which
Senate.
he called this extraordinary session of Concuss.
And now, if any one wants any thing fur her to con-
firm what is here presented, and to negitive still
further General Harrison'  imputed inclination for
a Bank, I must give it to them m the words ot the
gentleman who spoke for him in North Carolina
pre ¡rious to the election of last fall, and of whose
speech many ten thousand copies were published
by 'he Harrison Committee of Ihe State, and
which gentleman was selected by the General for
the place of Secretary of the Navy, and now fills
that office His a.tswer to Ine imputation that
©eneral Harrison was in favor of a National
Bank, was in these words:
"IT IS FALSE"'
So much for General Harrison's election as the
kst of this question, and, as for the gentleman
elected on the same ticket with him, and now 1m
successor in the Presidential chair, it is slill worse
for the Bank advocates There lives not a man
on earih, so long and so deeply commuted against
a National Bank as Mr. Tylei1 not even General
Jackson, or Thomas H. Benton' Mr. Tyler be-
gan the war before I was in the Senate, and before
General Jackson was President. He voted for the
judicial process to annul the charter Lit 1819. He
supported the veto of 1832. He has delivered in-
numerable speeches against it, as unconstitutional,
inexpedient, unnecessary, corrupt in us prac'ice,
demoral zing in its tendency, and political m its
tharacter; and a!l this since the signature of the
charter ot 1819 by Mr. Madison. The election of
Mr. Tyler, no more than that of General Harn-on,
can be claimed as a Bsnk triumph. Just the
conirary They stood before the country, b6th of
them, so far as their Bank opinions were visible,
as and Bank candidates What a fraud, then, to
claim tho e elections now as Bank tuumphs.
I have given reasons enough for the postponement
of this bill; reasons enouga to show that the rules
of fair legislation, and the principles of republican
representative Government, require th s bill to be
deferred until the new representation under the
census of 1840 shall be in these legislative seats
I have given reasons enough to show this, but I
have another behind, going to the same effect, a i 1
which it is my duty to present I speak of the
growing intelligence of the people on the subject of
banking—their rapid learning at this tim —and the
speeoy completion of their education. Since 18"i2,
since the veto message of that year—the Amenran
population has been at school—at the Bank se'.ool
—studying hard—learning fast—paying their Bank
masters frightful sums for their tuition—but still
teceiving mslruc ion enough ta compensate for the
enormity i f the price. The people have made an
immense progress in this learning, the ploughman,
knows more about banking now than ihe professed
politician did ten years ago. They have learnt an
immensity, but not all. Further schooling is ne-
cessary, and three years is my estimate of the
lime that is yet necessary to complete the Bank
education of the American people. In that time,
I am of opinion, their education will be complete,
the nation vill graduite, and then wc shall be able
to work at a charter like masier workmen, and
not, as we now do, like half-learnt appren'ioes I
litnit myself to three years, and urderlake to s3y
that, by the end of that time, the m^s enes,
dogmas aicana, tneks, juggles, frauds, aid enmes
of banking will be thoroughly understt od, and
hear ¿ly scorned, as much so as the eratt and mys-
tery of the conjurers, augurers, sooth sayeis, and
oracles, and juggle s of old, now ar-\ fn three
years, such a charter as the ore we are now grant-
ing, will be a sco-n m the public eje, and a s'emh
in the public nostrils I's ptstilent and ant qua ed
enactments; its monopolies, exclusive privileges,
State corjunclions exemp'ion from private liabnty,
exemption from bankrupicy, exemption from taxa-
tion, its trade in com, trade in foreign bills of cx-
ehasge, secret proceedings, privilege to owe mire
than it can pay, its war upon the gold currency,
its fabrication of small no e-, its cheatery of the
Constitution and mockery tf the State;,, its pay-
ment of the public revenues in paper money, its
circulation of irresponsible paper as a national
currency, its juggling " compromise" amendment,
its novel function of National Treasury; these, all
