"Nett proceeds of sales not known.
This is not all:
To this sum of $85,974,052 84,1 add, accord-
ing to a statement which I have received from the
General Land Office, showing the amount of the
two and three per cent, funds reserved oat of the
sales of the public lands, for the nse of the new
States, accord i o? to their charters, a farther sum
of $4,410,479 22.
Tnis last statemtnt is represented to be a correct
account of the sums accruing to the several Slates,
from the earliest period to the 30th < f Sept. 1839.
If, then, I am correct, the charge npon the Bab-
Ik Treasury for the purchase.ol the public lands, and
for their management under the operations of the
land system, may be stated as follows:
The costs in the acquisition and
management of   the   public
lands to the 30th September,
1838
For the extinguishment of the
Indian title   ...
For the fund reserved ont of the
proceeds of the sales for the

Making in all   -          -          -   $192,604,636 09
It is true that this entire sum has not yet beea
drawn from from theTieasury; but portions of it
are hereafter to be disbursed in accordance with
Indian treaties.     It nevertheless is a subsisting
charge upon  the Treasury; and unless it shall be
shown  that the receipts have been equal to that
amount, the injustice of diverting that .'ource of
revenue,  the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands, to other purposes, would manifesily appear.
It will be observed that I have not included any
portion of the costs and expenses of the Indian wars,
which have grown out  of  negotiations fur the ex-
tinguishment of Indian titles; but nothing could be
more just, in my judgment, than to charge the pub-
lie lands wiih the cost of the Indian wars, since the
1st of January, 1836, as they were  unavoidable
charges upon the Treatnry, occasioned by the pur-
chase of these Indian titles.
I am not disposed to make any wrong impres-
sions upon this subject; but when a disltibution of
the revenue arising from, the sales of the public
lands is contemplated, it strikes me that the Ame-
rican people ought to know how stands the ac-
count between the public lands and the public
Treasury. They ought to have presented before
them the balance sheet. They ought to know
whether we have not already made very liberal ad-
vances from the public Treasury en account of the
public lands, and whether millions upon millions
have not been drawn fiom the pockets of the peo-
ple to carry on our land operations. If so, it
wou'd be monstrous to abstract from the Treasury
the proceeds of the land sales, for distribution
among the Stales—to keep up unnecessary in-
direct taxation—to impose and continue un-
necessary burdens upon the people. And for whail
To supply the Treasury with the means of paying
Indian annuities. And whenever an Indian tract
of land shall have been sold, instead of putting the
money into the Treasury for public use, it is pro-
posed to scatter and distribute the avails to the four
winds of Heaven. This is the object contempla-
ted. Is it wise—can it be just—to make such a
disposition of the public revenues? I answer, no.
The people will answer, no. It is our bounden duty
10 husband all our resources—to have this Govern-
ment administered with economy—to avoid ail un-
aecessary taxation, no matter «hat may be its
form—take from the people all that shall be
wanted for a faithful, just, and responsi-
ble discharge of onr trusts, and take no more.
Then will the people repose confidence in their
rulers—then will they cling with steadfast hope
to the Government of their choice.
I ooght not, however, to argue the affect of this
distribution, until I shall have made a full state-
ment of both sides of the account. I have endea-
vored to state the costs of the public lands; but it
has necessarily fallen far short of the reality.
Not an Indian treaty is made without its contain-
ing specific obligations on the part of the Go-
vernment for the erection of mills, mechanic shops,
the supply of provisions and of artificers. These
items of charge are necessarily excluded, and the
expenses incurred in carrying on negolia'ions with
the Indian communities have not been, and could
not be, taken into the account. He, who is con-
versant with the history of our public expenditures,
will know that these items have imposed a severe
charge upon the Treasury. But I trust that I shall
have shown enough to satisfy every man in the
community how stands this account between ihe
lands and the Treasury, and I will now proceed to
state what have been, from the commencement of
our land system, the receipts ito the Treasury from
the sales of the public lands.
The following resolution passed the House of
Representatives on the 11th of January, 1838:
li'solved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed
to communicate to this House—
The whole amount of public lands belonging to the United
States, so'd since they were ceded to tiie United States; distin-
guishing the amount of sales in each year, exhibiting the nett
proceeds, and distinguishing between those which have been
sold within the limits or the different States and Territories.
In answer to this resolution, the Secretary of the
Treasury communicated to the House of Reresen-
talives a report from the Commissioner of the Ge-
neral Land Office, containing the information called
for. From that report it app°ars that ft\m 1796
to Ihe 30th September, 1837, ths quantity of land
sold was 75,025,055 50 acres, and that the actu-
al amount paid by ih? purchasers was $106,245,656
88, and that during that period there was received
into the Treasury for the land thus sold $94,037,946
81. This statement cxhibi's the amount of all
the public land sold from the commencement of
the sales in 1796 to the terminaticn of the credit
system, 30th Jane, 1820, and also including the
amount received under the cash syvtem from 1st
July, 1820, to 30th September, 1837, which makes
the aggregate of sales and receipts as above stated.
The following (able exhibiis ihe same general re-
sults; but contains a particular exhibit of the lands
sold in each of the States and Territories within the
same periods of time, and the amount paid by the
purchasers, and the actual sum paid into the Trea-
sury; and it is thus made manifest, that from the
earliest periods of ihe sales to ihe 30th September,
1837, the whole amount actually paid into ihe Trea-
sury in cash, and in evidences of public debt, as the
avai's of the sales of the public lands, amount to
$98,376,532 38.

In addition to the amount paid into the Treasury, there has
been received by Government, in payment of the public lands,
as follows, to wit:
Certificates of public debt and army land war-
rants      ......       «984,189 91

Military lana scrip          ....      1,678,992 33
86,037,378 01
It will be seen that I have not included in the
estimate of receipts the sum of $2,448,789 44, the
amount of the Mississippi stock received by the
Government for the public lands—as I have not
charged the public lands with a like amount of
Mississippi stock issued in payment for lands pur-
chased by the United States of ihe State of Georgia.
To ihis aggregate of receipts into the Treasury
from the sales of the public land*, should be added
what has been realized since the 30th of Septem-
ber, 1837; and from the documentjnow upon our
tables, this may be put down at $10,214,154, mak-
ing the amount received into the Treasury Iron 
the avails of the sales of the public lands, up lo
31st December, 1839, including the evidences of
public debt taken in payment, the sum of $10P,590,-
686 38. This turn, then, of over one hundred and
eightv million of dollar , consumes the aggregate
which the Government has received, either in cash
or in the extinguishment of its outstanding liabili-
ties, from the sales of the public domain up to the
elose of the year 1839.
The whole costs of the public lands, including
existing liabilit.es of the Government, on account
of Indian treaties, if any reliance can be placed
upon the official commit nica'ions made from the
public departments of our Government, may be .

And tne whole receipts into the Trea-
sury, from the sales, amount anly
to                                              108,590,688 38

hnds'of        -          .           -     $54,913,949 71
It will be at once seen that I have not credited
the publ.c lands with the special grants which have,
from time to time, been made to States,to corpora-
ttoi s, and to individuals, for various objects. Nor
have I credited the public lands with the grants
made as donations to the officers and soldiers of the
Revolution, or 11 the soldiers of the last war, for
the reas in that the Treasury has not been en-
riched a dollar by these donations and grants.
And it will be seen that I have not, in the estimate
of costs, included any thing for the expenses of
the land department, since the 30lh September, •
1838.
But my purprs  has been attained. My ob-
ject has b*en to go so far into ihis examination, as
to ascertain, witn sufficient certainty, the state of
ihe account between the lands and the Treasury. I
conld not regard the proposition submitted by the
Senator from Kentucky with any favor, inde-
pendent  of    all   constitutional   scruples,  if it
