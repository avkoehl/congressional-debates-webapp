HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 25, 1865-8.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch of 5.50 p. m. was delayed two hours-the wire was down. The last deserter from Hill's came from Mahone's division and reported at 10 a. m., and reports no movement. From Ninth Corps front, as result of artillery fire, I have from Tidball:

The enemy's reply to our fire indicated no change whatever in their artillery-they fired from mortars and guns as usual.

I cannot yet find out that any of Hill's corps has moved.
