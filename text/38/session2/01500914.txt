THANKS TO GENERAL THOMAS.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there is a joint
resolution on the table which has been passed by
the House of Representatives and favorably re-
ported from the Military Committee of the Sen-
ate, tendering the thanks of Congress to Major
General Thomas and the gallant officers and men
under his command, for late brilliant operations
in Tennessee. I propose to cull up this resolu-
tion with a view to its passage at as early a mo-
ment as practicable, as a tribute most deservedly
due to those who have evinced such skill and
courage in the defense of our country, crowned
as that skill and courage was with so much suc-
cess. But in doing so, I desire that equal justice
shall be done to others who have participated in
the same operations, and contributed largely by
their valor and endurance and promptness to the
utter rout and demoralization of the rebel army
under General Hood. I allude to the Navy co-
operating with GeneralThomas, under command
of Acting Rear Admiral S. P. Lee. i have had
in my drawer for some time an amendment tend-
ering the thanks of Congress also to Acting Rear
Admiral Lee and the officers, petty officers, sea-
men, and marines under his command, ami ask
j leave to presentthe sameand have it printed, that
it may come up with the original resolution of
the House of Representatives.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
will be recpived informally, and the Chair will
put the question on the motion to print it.
The motion was agreed to.

ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. CONNESS. I move to postpone all prior
orders and take up Senate bill No. 3S0. I wish
to say to the Senate that it is a bill reported on
favorably by the Committee on Public Lands,

who reported it it will in my opinion excite no
discussion; and yet U is of gieat consequence to
us that it be acted on promptly here and sent to
the other House, It is an amendment to an act
of last year which provided for the sale of town

great consequence to us, and I do not think it
