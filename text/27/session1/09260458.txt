I was nota memberof Congress at the time the coinpromise
act Was passed, butt have been informed by those who were that
it was understood as a part of that compiomise that, inregu
lating the tanff at the revenue standard, the proceeds of the
public landa were not to be considered as a part of that it¡ venue,
but that the revenue was to be exclusively raised from im posts
and, indeed, the fact that the land distribution bill passed the
Senate on the 25th of January, 1833, and the compromise act
not until the 28th of February, 1833 is pretty conclusive that
the compromise act stood upon grounds exclusive of the land
fund, and that the latter was yielded as a source of revenue
That was certainly the idea of President Jackson and of both
the tommiUees that reported on the subject at that session of
Congress It is a remarkable fact that while theae committees
differed widely m their political composition, as well as in their
recommendation of the disposition of the proceeds of these
lande,fhey fully concurred with thePresident that the public lands
should no longei.be looked to as a source of national le venue
The Senator from N<-w York, [Mr Wr ght ] in his veiy
able speech dihvered on the subject at the last se smn, assu
med the position that theie wa.s o deficit on the pan of the
lands, upon an accojnt stated between them and the Govern
ment 1 have endeavored to show how that matter a and«
The same Senator, in K-Iation (o the opinion of the late Pre&i
dent Jackson, stated in his speech, which has been extensively
circulated and generally read
' The late President Jackson has also been repeatedly quoted
as a friend to this distribution policy, and quotations from se
veral of his early messages has been read to ihe Senate to show
his views This was fair as to him, and fair as to tne question,
but what were his views as thus siven by himsefi To disburse
the íevenue when the Treasury was in want? So far from that,
they were to relieve the Treasury from a surplus "
1 his view of the Senator is perfectly correct, so far as ge
neral revenue was concerned I desire to do both the late Pre-
sident Jackson and the Senator from New York justice in that
particular But it i<i to be legmtei that tij(¿£efid.tor had not
turned his attention to the message of 4829, wheietbe Presi
dent refers to the lands, and disposes of them IS o leference is
there made to a surplus The l<xnd fund was not eons deied
by him as general revenue but subject to ched spoaition of
Congress, in the exeicise of i sound discretion Thy extiacts
from the mepsage v*i!l clearly sustain this [ osition, and show
conclusively that the Senator from N York begged theque^tion
upon which he gave the opinion of the late President Jackson
It is there fore submitted that these lands should no longer be
relied upon as a source of national revenue, but that the taiiff
should beplaced at the revenue standard, as is coi templa ed
by the Secretary of the Tieasury, by subjecting to a duty those
articles of luxury and extravagance which are consumed by
the rich alone, and only by such oí them as choose to purchase
and use them It is said that this will be a tax on those am
cles, which will be paid by the consumer Thic is the usual
argument, but it is not always true, as much of the increase uf
duty on an article is quite as frequently borre by the producer
or manufacturer in a foieign country, as by the consumer in
this The duty where the article is consumed, in some cases
produces a coirebpondmg ^eduction in *he price of the fo eign
article at home, and the consumeL here pays little more for it
than if no such duty existed But suppose the consumer here
paid al!, His a voluntary pry merit by those who purchase the
foreign article, while the distribution will extend its vmiymg
influence to those who do not as well as to tho^e who do
consume |the European article 1 oi the purpose of
showing that the views which I entertain of the impolicy
ofiookmg to the lands as a source of national revenue
are not. new, or confined to myself alone I will read to the Se
nate theopwioiv* of others to which I have alluded, an <1 which
will have more we ght with Senates ovei the way, as well as
with a large portion of the Ameiican people, than any thing
that cotilleóme from this paitofthe Senate I refer to the
opinions of Piesi unt Jack^n andMr King—those oí the for
meras contained in ¡us annual messages, and thote of the lat
teras decían d in anu her part of the repoi t from winch I have
already read copious extracts Mi n h<*ie read the fol owing
extracts, to which he had referred, from the mes^a^eo
President Jackson, in his fi stmessase, 1829, says
"1 o avoid the<=eevilo, it appear^ to that the mist safe, just,
and federal disposition which could be made of thi* sin plus
revenue would be its apportionment among the several States
according to their ratio of representation And should this
measure not be found warranted by the Constitution, that it
would be expedient to propose to the Stated an amendment au
thonzingtt"
He does not say that it would be unconstitutional to diitn
bute surplus revenue generally, but he thinks it so impoitant
asto jusnfy an ameodment to the Constitution, should doubts
on tha' point exist But hear him on the lands, which he placed
on en irely difFei ent grounds from general revenue
In President Jackaon's fourth message, 1832, he says
"\mong the interests which meut the consideration of Con-
gress after the paymentof the public debt, oneof the raoit im-
portant in my view is that of the public land* Pievious to the
formation oi our present Consti utiun, it was ucotnmerged by
Congress that a portion of the waste lands owned by the S ates
should be ceded to the United States foi purposes of general
harmony, and asa fund to meet the expenses of the war The
tecomoiendauon was adopted, and at different periods of time
the States oí Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, North and
South Carolina, and Georgia, gianted then vacant soil for the
uses for which it had been asked As the lands may now be
tCnsi¿sr& das reheve^i.om this pledge, the object lor which
tsj&y were ceded having been accomplished, it la in the discre
tion of Congress to dispose of them in such way as best to con-
duce to the quiet, haimony, and general interest of the Amen
can people in examining this question, all local and sectional
feelings should be discarded, and the whole United States re
gaided as one people, interested alike in theprospeuty of their
common, country "
A^am "It epems to me to be our true policy that the pubhc
lands shall cease as soon aapiacticable, to be a source of re-
venue, and that they be sold to settlers, in. limited parcels, at a
puce baiely sufficient to reimburse to the United States the ex
pense of the present system and the cost arising under our In
dian compacts "
It has been urged that General Jackson was only speaking of
surplus revenue, and therefore his remarks were not applica-
ble to the present state of the question I answer that he ex-
pressly says, that,
"As the lands may now (1832) be considered as relieved from
this pledge, the object for which they were ceded having been
accomplished," (i e the paymentof the debtof the Revolu
tion,andnot the accruing debts of the Government,) "it ism
the discietion of Congress to dispose of them m such way as
bebt to conduce to the quiet, harmony, and general interest of
the American people "
The report of Mr King, to which I have so often referred,
assumes the same ground it declares, after an elaborate exa
mmation of the subject ' This committee turn with confidence
from land offices to the custom houses, and say here are the
true source** of Fedeial revenue give land to the culuvatoi—
tell him to keep hibmoney, andlay ltoutin their cultivation '
1 will not pursue this pail of the argument further, enough has
been shown, I tiust, to establish the position that the proceeds
of the sales of the public lands, after the payment of the pub
lie debt, were not considered by anv political paity asordioaiy
revenue, and subject to the same lules that govern duties col
lected upon imports
It has been urged m (he debate on other subjects, when the
distubution question, orín o hei words the land bdl, has been
adverted to, "that this is an unpropmous time to act upon any
of these great m^aouies, because the people are rot represent-
ed under the last census That argument would certainly
have much force if the proposed measures weie not m accor-
dance with the known will oí a lavge majority of the people
But letSenatois satisfy themselves on this point, am1 th~y vnV
see, upon a fair b isis of calculation, being governed by the late
census as to numbers, and by the last Presidential election as
to po itiol opinions that the vote on this bill in the Senate
would be 38 to 14, if the States were fairly íepresented, and in
the House the majority would be still more overwhelming I
therefore submit it to those Senators who are daily harpmgon
this position whether the argument growing out of a true state
of the facts of the cásele not directly against 'hem LetSena
tois look d.t this table, and then make thui calculations

\nothei a-Efume it wh ch gen^emea havp been i i the habit of
rtsotting daily to n this body, ¡s the charge that the distnbu
tion is to favor British st ckjobbers, by enabling the States to
pay their debt upon their foreign bonds This argument must
be predicated upon the hypothesis that the States will prove
faithless to their engagements unless this bill becomes a law, and
faithful if it shall pass, for if the States now intend to pay their
debts in eond faith, which no one can doubt whatever aid they
may receive from the passage of this bill will mure exclusively
to their own benefit, and not to the benefit of their creditors If
they do not so mtenl, would the small sum they wou'd receive
under this bill change a determination formed, by which they
had resolved to appropriate the amount they have received to
their own use, in violation of their solemn contracts, to their
own dishonor?   Will such a position be for a moment insisted

upon by any one! If not, then the distribution will be for the
benefit of thf States, and not the BntiBh stockjobbers, as some
contend
I am awaie that an objection to this measure is urged, that it
amounts to an assumption of the debts of the States, and there
fore it is an improvident measure This argument will only
apply to States that are indebted, if at all, and as the other
States received an equal propoi tion, m the ratio, it cannot apply
specially to any That tin  measure stands upon its own me-
nts, independently of the debts of the States, is conclusively
proved by the fact that the bill of 1832, which passed bath
Houses of Congreis, pieceded the debts of the States, and there-
fore could have no connection with, or reference to them But
suppose that this measuie shall come m aid of tfle States m the
payment of then debts ar d the maintenance of then public faith
—suppose it should lighten the burdens of the people of the
indebted States, and diminish the direct taxes they now have to
pay to meet the interest of their debts—is that an object so re.
pugnant to the feelings of Senators that they will oppose the
measure on Aatgiound1 Do Senators desire to see the people
of the debtor States crushed to the eaithl Or do they wish to
see these States violate their engagements, and cover themselves
with dishonor"1 Can it be possible that such feelings animate
the bosoms of high minded and honorable men? Can a single
State be disgraced without affecting her sisters, more or lessl
Time was when there was not so miKh repugnance to the idea
of even a direct assumption of the debts of the Slates
The State debts of the Revolution were assumed directly by
the General Government, and if some Senators will look to
the amount assumed for their own States, and paid for their
din ct benefit, I am much mistaken if they do not find that it is
toolatetobehomfied at the bare mention of the possibility
that this bill mav, by indirection, pay a part of the debts of the
States which they are bound to pay whether the bill becomes
a law or not Í woutd especially refer the Senator from South
Caiolma, [Mr Cai/boun,] who opposes this bill on that, among
other "rounds, as I understand, to the amount paid for his State
It may be said that those were debts incurred by the States in
the war of the Revolution, atid that these were created in time
of peace To this it may be answered that these debtor States
contributed to the last war mote than any of the States did to
the Revolutionaiy wai, they had no other means ot raising
levenuethan that of direct taxation, while the States of the
Kevo'ution levied their own imposts, and had the whole pro-
ceeds of the sales of the public lands within their limits I
am notpiessmgthe argument in favor of assumption, butl
am meeting the position which would deny to the debtor States
thejustice of the provi«'ons of this bill, lest it might indirectly
opeiate a¡¡ an abruption of a part of thfir debts, or, in other
words enable them to pay a part of then debts I believe it
to be due to the States that the distribution should be made,
and it is ceitamly no objection to me that it will be a relief
measure, to some extent, to the people of the deb or States
The Government was formed for the benefit of the people, and
it should be so administered as not to defeat the purposes of its
creafon "While this measine is just to the old ¡states, it is
liberal to the new, and it ought to satisfy all The table which
I will now read to theSenate will give the data for al] the cal-
dilations under the bill
