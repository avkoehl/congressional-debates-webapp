General R. E. LEE,

Commanding.

Your letter* of to-day is just received. I think that a division from the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Corps each have gone off with General Butler, but that the balance of the two corps are here, and the Eighth Corps with them. The objection to a move by us against any force on this side is that the enemy can re-enforce largely against us, unless you could co-operate so as to prevent the enemy from making such re-enforcements. If I could get a reliable division, such as Pickett's, to assist me in any operations on this side I could move out with safety and ascertain whether we could break through the enemy's line, but with the forces that I now have, I think to attempt it would be a little hazardous.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 30, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER GARY'S BRIGADE:

Send out special scouts to ascertain position of Gregg's cavalry, and to watch him.

O. LATROBE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant General.
