July 26, 1863.

Major-General MEADE,

Warrenton, Va:

It is impossible to promote General Warren at present. There is no vacancy. I have recommended the discharge of certain useless major-generals, but it has not been acted on. The delay in sending back detachments of cavalry results from want of horse equipments, all on hand having been sent to your army and to General Couch. Others are expected daily.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

How far from Alexandria can the troops from Washington guard the Orange and Alexandria Railroad? I ask, that I may direct my troops to connect with them. Do you desire or expect I should take any steps for the reoccupation of the Shenandoah Valley, now abandoned by the enemy? GEO. G. MEADE, Major-General. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 27, 1863. Major-General MEADE, Army of the Potomac: I see no advantage in the reoccupation of the Shenandoah Valley. Lee's army is the objective point. General Heintzelman will reply in regard to his guarding the railroad.
