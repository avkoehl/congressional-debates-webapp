that, if this couioe weie peisisted m, it would stnkea fatal

did so, he said, that the P esident aid the Se re ary of the

a proper position
Mr CAMBEELENG eaw no necessity for euch a round
arout course, since all that was necessary was to camply
with the President's request He theh mads a motion to that
effect
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio wascteai^y ol opinion that that
was the bettei course The President had done all that could
be expected of him—sent an explanation that must besatisfac
toiy, and requested the wuhdtawad of the papers
Mr DROMGOOLE having made some suggestions,
The SPEAKER said the parliamentary iorm would be to
move to disch ¡rge the committee to wh >m the papers had been
íefened therefrom, and that they be returned to the President
Mi C\MBRELE:v(? modified his motion pursuant to the
¡SpEiKE'i's suggestion.
Mr RU33J3LL said it was with a similar object he had in-
tended to make the motion indicated by him
Mr McKENNVN moved le postpone the further considera-
tion of the subject till to morrow
Mr ADAM  said, as the President and the Secretary of the
Treasuiyhad both stated that these objectionable papéis had
been sent to the House bj inadvertence and umntentiunaUy, he
would not wish to hold either of those highofhceis responsible,
but he Would say, that if they hadbeen sent intentionally it woul 1
have been the gieatestbi each of privilege he had ever known,and
though he didnotwuh to apply mysevonty,itwasapparent,that
the p ipers having been sent (noted an 1 sent forth to the world,
as much mjuiy would be dom to the persons calumniated, to
the may oi and highly lespettille individuals of New Yoik, as
if the) had been sent in emionallv View it as a question of
pnvi ege, he wa**opposed to any postponement, but as the gen
tleman liom the city of New \ork was not in hi^ seat, he
would be willing it should be postponed till he came in
Mi MeKENNANsaid he would modify his motion so as to
postpone the cons deration of the message for two hours
The SPEAKER suggested that the calling on committees for

Mr McKEiSNAN acquiesced in that suggestion, and the sub

Mi HARPER, onka\e, hid on the table an amendment he
proposed, hereafter, to submit to some bill, but (he title of it
was not disclosed
Mr BOULDIN fmm the Committee for the Distnctof Co
lumbia, i(,port*d, without amendment, Senate bill to extend the
ehaitei of the Bank of Alexandua in the city ei Mexandna,
[to enable it to wind up its affair",] which wis postponed till
^atiud iy, 1th of June on motion of Mi  PETRlKiN
Mi H also repm ted, without amendment Senate bill to ton
tmue the corporate existence oí the banks in tho District of Co
lumbia
The bdlhavmg been read through, Mi B moved that it be
put onus thud leading, and made an eainest appeal m behalf
o! that motion
Mi PLTRIKIX moved to postpone the bill till Monday
week, and gave his reasons therelor He wanted the House
to have time to liokinto the subject, and he wis opposed to
this mole of legislating by piecemeal
Mr BOUIDl'V remarked that iilthe charters of these han k=¡
would expire on the 4th of July next and unless the House did
not act upon this bill soon, it would be of no use
Mr THOMAS added fuither ¡hat there wis no tune now to
go into a more full examination of the bank question gtneially
Moreover, the reductions of this bill as toa resumption of
specie payments, would tnable the ÍIou¡-e hen after to di=?tin
guish between the solvent banka tnd the rotten, it theie wete
any of the latter The bill wa*-  a somewhu hard one, but as
the banks weie willing toreri ive ii he hope lit would be passed
without delay If tlipy attempted to ft ame a measure for a
rechauei of these banks for twenty yeirs they might send a
bill to the Senate wh  h would be rejec en, and thus leave the
I>is*uct with nit banking ficihne
Mi MI ROER an 1 Mr HAMPER commented upon the very
haid feature^ of ti i bil more so, the latur insisted, than an\
State in the T ih n had dt vised and that he should move to
strike out one o! the restrictions m it
Mi PETRIKIX addiessed the House for some time in op
position to the bill md complained of the hurried manner m
which it was at temp ed to be crammed down their ihroats,with
out deliberation oi consideration
Mr BOULDIXsaid he would do what he believed he had
never done befóte demand the previous question and having
done ft a the House rpcon^idered it—ayes 74 noesbO
Mr DROMGOOLE called for the yeas and nays on ordering
the mam question butthev weie refused, and the mam question
was decided to be putwithou* a division
The main question was on ordering the bill to a third reading,
and thereupon—
Mi YELL a^k" 1 for the yeas and nays, which were ordered,
and weie yeas 131 naye-il
So die bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third leading to
day and the question being on its passage, (the House having
voted down apropos ion to postpone it til! Monr'ay next )
Mi ADAMS moved to recommit the bill to the Committee
foi the District of Columbia, with instructions so to amend the
same a<* to provide that no dividends or profit? should be paid
to the stockho'ders oi these banks a' any time when they have
suspended «peci*1 rayments
Mr riLEVORE remarked that it required amendment m
anothei particular The bill contained no provision for the
assent of the banks, and in case, therefore, of any suit being
brought against either of them, under the restrictions of the bill
the plaintiff would be unable to pro^e the bank or banks had
censented thereto.
Mr BOÜEDIN had not ibe'shghtest objection to either of the
amendments, bu>he dreaded hazarding the passage oí the bill,
which would be periled if the bill was recommutedj and thereby
iurthei delayed
The CHAIE now announced that the morning hour had
expired                                                                                     , ,
Mr iiOULDIN hoped they would finish this bill, and he
would move a suspension of the rule lor the purpose
Mi ADAMb suggested to the gentleman not to press the mo-
tion, but suffer the bilí to he over for a single day
Mr BOULDIN persisted id his motion, but it was rejected,
and the bill lies ovet for to ¡morrow
The House then took up the President's mcesage, as girfifl
above
Mr HOFFMAN reminded the House that, yesterday, he had
expressed his belief that the President had no knowledge of
the&e papers, and it gave him pleasure to find that the President
had piomptly and fuily and completely exonerated himself It
had arisen iron* his too great confidence in the head of the
Tieasury Oepaitment, bin Mr H m&isted that that gentleman
had not purged himsell, for he had no right to have ordered
such libels to be placed on the files among the archives of the
country, and his stating that he had not given them a critical
examination, was no excuse He íejoiced, however, that the
Pre&identhad exonerated himself, and ihat he had himseli pio-
posedwhatMr H'sresolutiott contemplated He hoped they
would be withdiawn, and that the ait uf withdrawal would
lead such aleston as would prevent a similar lecunence heie
alter
Mr DROMGOOLE suggested whether it would not be bet-
ter first to lay the President's second message on thetabl"
The CHAIR replied that that could be done aftei wards
Mr WHITTTESEY.ofOhio, inquired if the former docu-
ment would go among the documents of the Hout-e
The CHAIR said tnat ordinarily they would, but undei this
expie&sion oí the House they would not The Chair would
direct the document to be reprinted, omitting the papers refer-
red to
Mr ATHER10N remarked thathe regretted to hear thecen
sures cast by the gentleman from New York upon the Secreta-
ry oí the Tieasury He did not tee why any imputation should
lest upon the Secretaiy for truotmg a clerk, more than upon
the President for trusting the Secretary The Secretary was
distinguished for his untning assiduity in the discharge of his
duties, and he trusted that the gentleman fiom New York would
take back what he had said of censure of the Secretary
Mr BR1GGS read from the letter of the Secretaiy oí the Trea-
sury, and s lid that it contained no Word of condemnation, or of
disapproval upon the extiacts3orupon the personal attacks con
tamed m them
Mr CUaHMAN inquired of the gentleman from New York
[Mr Russei t] if he did not know, at the time he moved his re
solution, that the papera complained of were on file m the office
of the Serietiiy ol the Treasury?
Mr RUbSELI íepíiedthat his ongmal call, moved by him,
was upon the ¡secretary of State, who íesponded that the inior
mat ion could not be iurmshed by him unless by order ol the
President Mr R then introduced another call upon the Pre
sidentfor it, the substance of which he stated and Mr R had
no possible means of knowing any thing oí these exceptionable
papéis
Mi OUSIIMAN then went onto lead the resolution, which
catli d foi all information in possession of the President upon
the subject oí the introduction of loieign papers, either irom
thecoirebpomlen.ee of a_,ents or other bourees, and he com
mented upon thr press oí business imposed upon the heads of
dipartments during a session of Congress, and it was impossi
ble that the Secretary could attend to ail his business personal
ly, and was obliged to tiust to clerks, for tl is reason, evtry m
dulgence ought to be extended to him
Mr HOFI MAN, aftei stating that the word if, was a veiy
meaning word, admitted, that if the Secretaiy of the Treasury
was distinguished for any thing, it was for his untiring indus
tiy, and then he went on to show the dibimction between the
Piesidentand the teecrtiary oí the Treasury These obnoxious
papers, he said, were sent to the Treasury singly, and not in
connection with a mass of papéis, and he wished to know,
whethei such papers should be filed without r ading and ex
animation by the Secretary It was well known that it was not
customary for the President to examine the documents pre
scribed with icpoitb of the heads of departments, though he
miidit think it expedient to du so heieafter He considered it
the duty of the Secretary to examine such papers connected
with the duties of his office, and hnd not applied any epithet
not strictly in accordance with the subject of inquiry
Mr CALHOUN would inquire how u happened that, if the
Secretary was a man of such untiring industry tnat these pa
pers had escaped his observation? And he wished to be informed
by the committee to whom the message had been reiened, whe
ther the obnoxious papers had comp m rnanuscí pt, and had
been regulaily copied by a clerk, or whether they were slips
cut out fiom a newspaper"?
Mr RUSSELL produced the newspaper from which one of
the offensive articles was taken, which was the New York
Iiuth Teller The other was a slip, apparently from the same
pjper    Neither oí them was transcribed
Mr CALHOUN then expressed his regiet that such a papei,
in any manner, whether through negligence or otherwise,
should have been communicated to the House lie thought it
disgraceful to iheSetretaiy that such a fact should exist, and
should be published to the country, and he did not see how that
oiheer could come out of the oideal unscathed
Mr MENErEL commented on the doctrine maintained by
the last Administration that the President was responsible for
the acts of his Secretaries and said that he must, upon that
doctune, be held re&ponsible iur this transaction He was op.
posed to having the ¡apera withdrawn from therecoids Be
wished to have them stand They would not go against the
President, for it appeared that as soon as the President became
aware of then character, he took the earliest opportunity to
disapprove ol them, and to a k leave to wuhdiaw them The
Secre ary he would neithei excuse nor condemn at present, but
he would desire that the record should stand comp'e'e, as m
one íoim f r anothet it furnished pioper ground foi examina
lion, if not for censure
Mr SIBLEY stated that he was about to move an amend
inent, and expressed his willingness to allow the President to
withdraw that part of his message which charged certain cm.
zens of the State of New York with corruption, and was going
on to comment upon the remark in the President's message,
