Washington City, November 21, 1861.

Governor CURTIN, Harrisburg:

I understood from your messages that all your regiments that went South were well armed. Did any of them go without arms, and if so, what was the cause?

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

HARRISBURG, November 21, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

All the regiments sent from Camp Curtin are fully armed with arms collected in the State and repaired. Coulter starts to-day fully armed in the same way. The independent regiments all expect to be armed by the Government and did not apply to me. My stock is exhausted. Power, McCarter, and Howell go without arms. If you will order the U. S. arms here repaired I can have 1,000 per week repaired as ours are at same prices. I wish no action taken in the consolidation of Rippey's regiment and Second Reserve Regiment until I get to Washington, or send some one, to-morrow. Please answer me immediately. I regret that my dispatch was misunderstood.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.
