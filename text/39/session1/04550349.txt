1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
the samef< further proceedings shall bo suspended until
the final judgment of such matter.
I offer this amendment upon the idea that the
powers to be executed by this bureau are plainly
and simply judicial powers. They are nothing-
else. They are the decisions of suits between
different parties. If T be right in this opinion,
as I feel assured that I am, it will present this
state of case: that in every question arising and
decided under this act there will be no remedy
whatever by a supervisory tribunal. The hon-
orable chairman of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary disclaims that there is any judicial power
vested in these officers. I shall test that point
with the honorable Senator either now or when
the bill shall come into the Senate. I shall pro-
pose to add an amendment in the form of a pro-
viso declaring that neither the Commissioner nor
the assistant commissioners, nor the agents ofthe
bureau, shall exercise any judicial power what-
ever under the bill. If a provision of that kind
were added I would not offer this section.
Mr. TllUMBULL. The Senator misunder-
stood me if he understood me to say that no
judicial power was conferred by this bill. I did
not intend to say that.
Mr. DAVIS. I withdraw the amendment
now pending for the present, for the purpose of
offering the one which I have just suggested, to
come in as a proviso to section eight:
Provided, That neither tlie Commissioner, assistant
commissioners, agents, or any officer under this bill,
shall exercise anyjudicial power whatever.
I ask for the yeas and nays upon the amend-
ment.
Several Senators. Oh, no; take them in
the Senate.
Mr. DAVIS. I withdraw the call for the yeas
and nays for the purpose of saving time; but I
shall offer the amendment again in the Senate,
and ask for the yeas and nays upon it then.
The amendment was rejected.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended.
Mr. MORRILL. 1 desire to move an exec-
utive session; T suppose it is not expected that
we can finish this bill this evening.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Will the Senator allow
me before I forget it to insert a couple of words
to which I presume there will be no objection,
before a vote is taken on the amendments made
in committee?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. _ Perhaps the
Senator will indulge the Chair in taking the j
Tote on the question of concurring in the amend- ]
ments made as in Committee of the Whole. j
Mr. TRUMBLTLL. Before that is done, I :
wish to amend one of the amendments made in j
committee.
Mr. CLAUK. IsuggesttotheChairtliatthe '
Senator from Kentucky, and some other Sena-
tors. propose to amend those amendments be-
fore they are concurred in. j
Mr. SUMNER. There is one of the amend- !
ments to which I wish to move an amendment
in the Senate. i
Mr. TRUMBULL. In the fifth line of the :
fourth section, as amended in committee, after
the word " Mississippi." T move to insert the
words "Alabama. Louisiana,1' so that it will
read, "unoccupied public lands in Florida.
Mississippi. Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkan-
sas.'' The effect of the amendment is simply
this : the fourth section, as amended, provides
for reserving public lands for the benefit of
freedmen and refugees in the States of Florida,
Mississippi, and Aikansas, and I propose to add
Alabama and Louisiana, having ascertained
since the amendment was offered in Commit-
tee ofthe Whole that there are public lands in
Alabama and Louisiana as well as the other
States named.
The amendment to the amendment was
agreed to.
EXEOUTITF. SESSION.
Mr. MORRILL. I now move that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of executive
busine.-s.
The motion was agreed to ; and after some
time spent in executive session, the doors were
reopened, and the Senate adjourned.
