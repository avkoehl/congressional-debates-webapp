to the House, or to violate its constitutional privileges In-
tention is the essence of crime Heedless and unregard-
ful of them he has been, but free in every sense, it is confi-
dently believed, of any delibérate design to violate the immum-
tiesofthe House, he isasmucli a victimas the member who
fell by his hand It cannot be forgotten, too, that in the action
of this House aie combined all the functions which in other cases
are divided between thecouus, which try and sentence, and the
Executive, in whom, when the sterner rules of law must con-
demn, is vested the benign power to mitigate the punishment,
or even to pardon it, wnere the conduct of the criminal or con
alterations of public policy authorized But, m this proceed-
ing, the House is the law maker, accuser, witness, and judee in
its own case, nsd should it pionounce a sentenceof expulsion,
that sentence can neither be mitigated nor reversed; it is the
final doom; and, before H is pronounced, should be weighed
most carefully, and found absolutely and indispensably-neces-
sary to maintain its privileges and assert its dignity "
