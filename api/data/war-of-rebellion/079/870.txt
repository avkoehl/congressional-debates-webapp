TUSCUMBIA, October 31, 1864.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond:

To prevent confusion, please inform me whether my presence with any army in the field imposes on the necessity of assuming command, and whether in that case it relieves from duty the immediate commander. Should not my orders pass merely through that officer, without destroying the existing system of organization?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

TUSCUMBIA, October 31, 1864.

(Via Mobile November 1.)

General S. COOPER:

Army arrived here yesterday preparatory to crossing Tennessee, which will be done soon as bridge is laid and necessary supplies obtained. General Hood found it impracticable to cross more to eastward without serious loss of time and life, moreover he is nearer here to his new base of operations.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

Have General Hood's telegrams to Secretary of War and General Bragg relative to his operations of 12th instant about Dalton been received? It is feared they may have miscarried.
