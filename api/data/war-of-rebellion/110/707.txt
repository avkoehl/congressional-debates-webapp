MACON, MISS., July -, 1864.

(Via Mobile July 15. Received Richmond 16th.)

JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President:

I concur in the request of General Brandon that the present organizations of the reserve companies be retained. Change will cause confusion and delay, and they are needed now. I have full confidence in the ability of General S. D. Lee to repel the enemy in North Mississippi. The fight yesterday not decisive, but position [and] performance all that can be desired.

CHAS. CLARK,

Governor of Mississippi.

(Received Richmond 15th.)

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Governor Brown's proclamation calls all exempts and details of the Confederate Government not in actual military service to report as part of militia. I ask that the Department will lay down a rule in the premises that Confederate officers in Georgia may know how far this remarkable proclamation is to be obeyed; before deciding, you should read the proclamation, the main purpose of which is to make issues with the President.

HOWELL COBB,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, July 15, 1864.

His Excellency President DAVIS:

I am decidedly opposed, as it would perpetuate the past and present policy which he had advised and now sustains. Any change will be attended with some objections. This one could produce no good.
