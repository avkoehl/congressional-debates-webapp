mand. I have no doubt but that Mosby will surrender his whole command on the terms given to General Lee. Arrangements have been made for a meeting at Millwood on Tuesday noon, when I expect to received the surrender. Meanwhile Mosby agrees to refrain from any operations whatever, and I have directed no offensive operations against his command to be made. They are aware of the death of the President.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Winchester, Va.:

Lieutenant-General Grant authorizes you to give to Colonel Mosby and his command the same terms as those agreed upon with General Lee. It, however, is to be understood that permission to return to their homes does not include former homes in loyal States or the District of Columbia. Persons from these places must take the oath of allegiance and get special permits from the War Department before they can return.
