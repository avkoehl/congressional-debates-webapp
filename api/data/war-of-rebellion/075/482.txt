Major-General SCHOFIELD:

General Howard is a mile and half south of Pine Mountain and pushing forward. General Hooker is on immediate left, pushing forward, converging toward Howard. General Sherman is very anxious we shall get possession of the Dallas and Marietta road to-night if possible. I shall push on until night-fall, and hope you will support my right.

THOMAS,

General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, June 15, 1864 - 6.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

I have developed the main line of the enemy's works; my skirmishers about seventy-five yards this side. They were pushed back a little by the enemy coming out of their works, but were immediately re-enforced, and now hold a crest in advance of the one where Captain Willard, of your staff, found me. My main line is upon the latter, from which we drove the enemy.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to say if your cannot get any farther to fortify yourself where you are. As far as he can see from where he is, General Hooker appears to have turned the enemy's left and is pressing them back onto your front. General Schofield reports having taken their first line in his front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. WILLARD,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
