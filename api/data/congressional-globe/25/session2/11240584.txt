the people aie called upon by the President to furnish ex íaoi
dmaiy supplies in the form otTreaomy noie^
\ir C was nut prepated to say, as it had been argued by
some, that Congress had not tiiepoioet to authorise the is^ue of
Treasury not^s But it wab a powet osuscenttbleof themost
dangerous abuse, tliat it could scarcely bo exeicised too watily,
or watched with too much j< alonsy
Our Governments surrounded by motives and temptations
to extravagance in the use of the public money Ihe veiy h i
bit oi voting and expending nece^aiy millions begets a Ui&ie
rard of public money, without taking into account the multi
tude of othet cau=es, honest and dibhouest, that feid to pio li
"ality Against this evil tendency theie i no othei sale check
or security but m t e people whobe ntetest muí evei be op
posed to it, ai d in tl e íebpoasiuili y ol their imeis to them
But, to appy t e conee'ive it is uete ->aiy that the people
should know and/e^ die existence ot thu evil, and the moie
sensibly and immediately they are made to feel it, the more
ctitamly wi 1 they icdress it If waslefuines- on the patt oi

as it weie, from tne people and tiie public &ci utmy I s extra

done to awaken the people to their true Mtuauun ¡Sonewiaxa

heaping up the materials of a n-itionai aebt in the fuin of

quences The ^ i lea^ury notes seem to descend upon t! em a&
the mere emanations of i benefieent Gnveinmeni-as the mi
puichased and fruitful showers of Heaven, that ome withe n
money and without price
But this delusion cannot labt always, and after it comes the
end—the bittei end, when all di suite must cea&et when the
people must find themselves saddled with burdens that they

The  pnmary and proper mode of supplying  the public
Treasury was bv taxation an 1 when that was inadequate to the
public necessities the usual alternative was to boirow money on

because they were generally the cheapest, because they weie
optn and undisguised, and because they weie understood by
the people, and would be ceitam to excite then jealous andvi

if they had been econu nieally applied to the public service It
rrmy he w nth while to state, m general terms the amount of

about twen y milhois nf dollars annually, and, m addition to
this, Congiess, wnhin the lost eight months, has granted to the
Adtmoiatiation ten millions of lieasury notes, and the fouitli
instalment of the moneys that were to have been deposited with,
the States, bung upwaidts of nine million  moie, making to 
geihei, ol extraordimry supplies, a sum exceeding nineteen
millions of dollars, sunjt-ct, however, toaue^u or deduction of

balanceo! twelve imhions of ex raordinary supply And be-

authorizing the^ale of the bond-* given u  the Government by
