had not been in such condition that the work
could not proceed. I do not suppose that a single
dollar of the $90,000 is intended to cover any
repairs of the canal.
The PRESIDENT. The hour for the special
ordefc having arrived, this subject will have to be
passed over.
Mr. PUGH. I trust that, if not inconvenient,
the Senate may take a vote on my proposition at
once.
The PRESIDENT. As the Senator from Ohio
desires a vote-on the resolution, if there be no
objection the Chair will submit the question.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. I should prefer to con-
sider the resolution a little more attentively. It
is in such general terms, that upon its face I could
have no objection to it; for, of course, I desire to
have removed all obstructions in the navigation
oftfhe Ohio river; but if the object specially an-
nounced is to make another canal 1 do not think
it necessary; and I should prefer that the subject
should go to the general committee, instead of a
select committee organized with a view to the
particular object.
The PRESIDENT. As the Senator from
Kentucky objects, the resolution will be passed
over, and the Senate will proceed with the special
order.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Tuesday, Jlpril 1, 1856.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
The SPEAKER stated that the first business
in order was the call of committees for reports.
Mr. DAVIS, of Massachusetts. I ask leave
to introduce abill to regulate coastwise shipments
between Atlantic and Pacific ports, of which pre-
vious notice has been given.
Mr. LETCHER. I object; and I give notice
that I will object to everything out of the regular
order of business.
CLOSE OF DEBATE ON THE OREGON BILL.
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. I move the usual
resolution to close debate, in the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, on the bill
makingappropriations to restore and maintain the
peaceable disposition of the Indian tribes on the
Pacific,and for other purposes,within five minutes
after its consideration shall be again resumed.
The motion was agreed to.
INDIAN HOSTILITIES IN OREGON, ETC.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I now move that the rules
be suspended, and that the House resolve itself
into the Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, (Mr. Giddings in the chair.)
The CHAIRMAN stated that the pending
question before the committee was on the sub-
stitute reported by the Committee of Ways and
Means for the bill making appropriations to re-
store and maintain the peaceable disposition of
the Indian tribes on the Pacific, and for other
purposes. The question was taken, and the sub-
stitute was agreed to.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. Chairman,! move
that the bill and substitute be laid aside to be
reported to the House; and that the committee
proceed to the consideration of the bill making ap-
propriations for invalid and other pensions.
The CHAIRMAN. If the bill and substitute
be laid aside, the business then before the com-
mittee will be the consideration of the President's
annual message, on which the gentleman from
Georgia [Mr. Warner] is entitled to the floor.
Mr. LANE. I hope the committee will rise
and report the bill in reference to Indian hostili-
ties to the House, so that it may at once be put
on its passage.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I would inquire whether
the gentleman from Georgia is anxious to speak
this morning.
Mr, COBB, of Georgia. If it be proposed that
the committee rise and report the Oregon and
Washington bill to the House, I have no doubt
that my colleague will yield for that purpose.
Mr. HOUSTON. I understand it to have been
uniformly ruled that, when debate has been closed
on a bill in the Committee of the Whole, and the
committee have acted on all amendments, and are
ready to report it to the House, they have no
discretion left to lay the bill aside, but must rise
and immediately reportit to the House.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules the
question of order.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I move that the com-
mittee rise, and that the bill and substitute in
reference to Indian hostilities in Oregon and
Washington be reported to the House, with the
recommendation that the substitute be agreed to.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, the Chairman reported that
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had had the Union generally under consid-
eration, and particularly House bill (No. '203) to
suppress Indian hostilities in Oregon and Wash-
ington, and had directed him to report the same
back with an amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I propose that the bill be
now put on its passage.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is informed that
the bill is not at the Clerk's desk.
Mr. HAVEN. Then I move that the bill be
recommitted; and that the rules be suspended, and
the House resolve itself the into Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union.
Mr. LETCHER. Where is the bill ?
Mr. MORGAN. I suppose that it is evident
that the bill is lost. [A laugh.]
Mr. CAMPBELL. I will state the facts in
reference to the disappearance of the bill, for the
benefit of my friend from New York. A col-
league of his, who has been very much interested
on the subject, procured the bill a few minutes
ago. He has not returned it to the Clerk. He
is absent from his seat, and we do not know
where he is.
Mr. HAVEN. If my motion is agreed to we
can go into committee, and, when the bill is re-
turned, come back into the House and pass it.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I desire to know where
the bill is ? [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. The Chair has no further
information on the subject than what he has
given to the House, that the bill is not on the
Clerk's desk.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I would inquire of the
gentleman from Ohio if he knows where the
bill is ?
Mr. CAMPBELL. I do not. I knew where
it was a few moments ago. It was then taken
away by a gentleman from New York.
Mr. COBB, of Georgia. Instead of adopting
the motion of the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Haven] to recommit and go into committee, I
suggest, inasmuch as the bill will be in the posses-
sion of the House in a few moments, that its fur-
ther consideration be postponed until one o'clock.
We shall have the bill then, in all probability, and
can go on with its consideration.
Mr. HAVEN. I have no objection to with-
draw my motion in favor of that suggested by
the gentleman from Georgia. My only object is
to further the business of the House.
The question was taken on Mr. Cobb's mo-
tion; and it was agreed to.
So the further consideration of the subject was
postponed until one o'clock.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama. I call for the regular
order of business.
Mr. ALLISON. I move that the rules be sus-
pended, and that the House resolve itself into th 
Committee of the Whole on the (state of thft
Union.
Mr. PRINGLE called for tellers.
Tellers were ordered.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania that he withdraw his motion,
and allow the committees to be called until one
o'clock.
Mr. ALLISON. I withdraw it.
