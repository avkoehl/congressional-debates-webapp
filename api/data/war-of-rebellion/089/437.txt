HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 30, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

General HUMPHRYES:

Just after I returned this evening I learned that the enemy captured a few of General Miles' picket-line between Forts Davis and Alexander Hays about 9 p. m. How many were captured I cannot say. General Mott is re-establishing the line. He was about relieving General Miles. It is said the pickets understood the enemy to be our own relief, and so did not fire a shot. I have manned the rifle-pits up to Battery 24. Perhaps General Crawford had better do the same beyond, though I anticipate no further advance unless because the enemy effected such easy capture. I know very little of the actual truth of the affair. It is said some of the vedettes remained in front after the posts had been captured, ignorant of the whole affair. The captain who brought in the report and who escaped has been in service only two weeks.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
