tain the amount of <x icnditure on any one object,
and 11 would have bren wonderful indeed if great
■waste and extravagance bad not been found to
prevail in too macy instances And to show the
the extent to winch tt bad been carried, he begged
leave to refer to a series of articles published over
the signature of Harry Blufi, in one of the be'st
literary papers in Virginia—with which, doubtle-s,
many gentlemen present were familiar Among
the instances of was e and extravagance brought to
notice in these papers, it was & ated that the repairs
oí tbe friga'e United Slates, afier a cruise of three
ypars, had amounted to $125 000 and upwards;
and again, this ssme frigate was placed under re-
pairs, a short time afterwards, at a co->t of $75,( 00
more
Mr. K referred to the following extract from tne
"Lucky Bog," by ' Harry Bluff:"
"Tt has been said thaL ships are ret aired at more than their
ouginal tost I have it lion good auit on y that one four
bloopsofwai which cost originally $85 000 was ie| nud ua
co-jt of <6I20 000 An 1, after all this expense, she would hat l!y
be woith, for the puiposes of wai, the salt contained in the
water which she displaces Dull beyond measuie, '-he could
neither come up with an infeiior, nor esrape from a snpenor
torce The onginal cost of the s hooner Shark was S22 000,
and, when last repaned, her lepairs alone cost ©46000 In
pi wing that the system is a luuious turo, 1 am willing tint the
ibuvt picts may be set aside as heal say' evidence, and that the
proofshou'd rest upon the testimony of the txpenditure hooka
them elvts—a veiy lew extraéis fiom which have found then
way into the Lucky Big ' By such testimony, then pama! as
it is, let the system be tried I challenge contradiction to the

These and other items, which Mr. K -would not
troub e tne committee to refer io, were sufficient to
s'-ow that no body rf mm wou d be pr<s_m d to
trake such iiwfol the public mon-y, if heie
b  1 bet u any acoountabd ty or respor^ibi ity in ihe
exj eiidiiurei.
Then there were various i eras of expendí
ture, with which he wou'd not trouble the Hous ,
but it was. suffio °nt to sho« t-iat no bod)
ot men would h?"e eummit'td Mich a va le
ot the pnbl r money, if tleie b°<\ be-a any
acco'iniabiiii', or aty ns ous bd iv, lor trie ex
pendnurc. Mr K i ext refened to the co t < f
c n true u g our pubhi -hips, an i drew a p-ialM
be *reo Le - xpet di u es f ir that pnroo e in Eng
land and m th s country,    ho  , by tin regula ioi -
of Great Britain, the cost of building their 74 sun
ships was fixed at §348 495, while the vary us
statements before him went to show that none oí
our ships of the line had ever been built for any-
thing like tbat sum. The cost of constructing our
public vessels had bertn vastly grea'er than that fixed
by the regu'ations of Great Britain, but the princi-
pal waste of the public money in. the naval service
had been in the frequent and unnecessary repairs
of our ships of war Fcr instance: when a hip re-
turns from a cruiie, she is dismant'ed and placed
in dotk, where she is allowed 10 go to decay, so
that, m the course of thrte or four year°, it costs
more to repair her than to build = new «hip. A
different course was pursued in the B itish navy:
there, when a ship returned home, *be was imme-
diately examined by the naval((instructor, aniLall
the repairs necessary to mffe^heSbíaworthy^wfe
plated on her at once It she wa net intended for
sea-service, she was dismantled, and all her arma-
men , rigging, and stores of evry description,
placd in tin public s'ores for preserva mn In
addititn to this, an offi er, with a suiiu ent num.
ber ol men, w« placed on b< i.rd ot htr to pre-
serve her from decay. Oar course was ihe. revtrs 
ot all thi ; for, a( er our ships rumned from a
cruise, they weie placed in dock, wiihout any
means being lain n for their preservation Mr K
next went on to refer to the creanon ol the Navy
Board in 1815, on whom all the ministerial dut e^
of the department were imposed Dy ihe act creating
it That boaid was requned to puichase a'l the
provisi >ns and stores, all the materials for the con-
struction, equipment, and repairs of the public ves-
sels, 'o suienmend ihtn titling out, and then sail
ing And to conduct all these vanous branch's of
the naval service, th y weie allowed the ser
vices of only some half a de/en clerks They,
however, in consequence of havn g ihe mode
of expenditure without system or a- oun'abihty,
to which he had relened, were tnablcd to carry
on the business of the department up to this
time, though they never could have shown, at any
one time, a correct account of the amount expend-
ed under any one head of expenditure, S range as
it might appear to be, it wab not in the power of
this Navy Board to give a correct account of the
cost of building, equ'pti ent, or sailu g of any one
of our shios of war; so en irely mixed up had the
difieren' appropriations been, in censequenoe of the
practice of transferring them horn one head (f i x-
pendnure to an ther To show how this s s em
had worked, Mr K rcfrircd lo a case at tie navj-
yard at Br< oklyn, Ntw York, in tv ut h, f r art¡< lei
purihistd by the navy ascnt at a (ost to ib< G iv-
ernment cf $29,000, it was a^ci r a tied, upi n in-
vestigation, 'hat only $14 'iflO had been expi ne'ed
He did not say the navy asent, bul io i ebody had
by this affair pmkete I ¿15 000 of ihe public mon
ey. Another ease of the same kind had occurred
at Norf 'k, upon whieh an investiga k n uas I ad
and it was ascerlamed that tbe navy agent bad
emb-7zled $60 000 of the pub) c me i ey
Mr MALLOftY thought ¡he gmt'eman was
m slaken He prcsum-d ih"t be re eired io the
case f Mi'es King, whos" accounts w re siil un-
settled, and who contended th.t there was but a
small amount due ihe Government.
Mr ICING sai* tha* he only re-f<rred to the
statements he hat rec iveel from the Navy De-
partment, at d he h?d rren n ned tbe c cps^s sim-
ply for the purpose of showing that the mode of con-
ducing the exreneliture (f lies rvit e   as =urh,
that undtr it any man o dispo e", oould emoez-
zle the publie money intrusie 1 to him.
He did not m'end to hit 1 ca e ihe n^'y agents,
but be would ob erve that th-y wo e nu ''or ¿ d to
make open conliacts for supplies, or to allow other
persors to do it for them, by which mtans the
grossest pbu'es may te prScn ed

Mr KING s >id that this fact had b-en s ated 'o

authority which he could no' doubt Mr K gjve
way to
Mr ADAMS, who called for the reading f he
fct, aMho]'zn<* tran'feis of >pprrpn-t oí s from
rne head of expenJitutc to anothe', and  that  pr >
vi«ion ot the act was read  by the  C erk as fol-
io* *
' Sec 5 And be it further enacted, That whenever, in tha
opmionofihe ¡secretary of the Navy,usliall be conducive to the
public interest to use any article of prot isi ns, materials, or
olhei stores, fori different appropriation from that under which
they may have been purchased for the aval seivice, it shall be
lawful for him to authoiizesuch use and it shall be his duty to
ceitily to the secretary of the Tteasury the value oi cost ot the
articles thus used and the Secretaiy ol the Treasmy is hereby
authorized and required to cause the proper ofhceis of the
Treasuiy to tiansfei the amount of such co&t or value upon the
books of tin Treasuiy fiom the appropuation for wh ctl the ar
tides may have been used to the appropuation from which
Uh y may have been or m ty be taken, s i that the actual expen-
dituie under each may be accurately shown "
Mr. KING observed that the general law upon
that ¡.ubject, applied to all the depar men.s of the
Government, as did al o ihe law of 1808, to which
I ¿e would refer the gentleman. He attributed most
|-^* the wasie and extravagance that had been prac-
tised in the expenditure of the public moi ey to
this mode ( f disbursi mem by appropriations, and
thr fact that the transfer of apptupna ions from
one head of expenditure to another was author-
ized by law In this way, the appropriations
became so amalgamated togciher, that no one
could tdl how the money was appl ed. There
migbt be no blame attached to any person, if you
have the mo^t correct and faiihful set of officers
on earth, yet, under the pre ent system, it would he
impossible to practise economy, and impi ssible tor
the Secrteary of the Navy o gt t proper returns
ot the moneys expended Impressed with the dis-
advantages attendthg tbe present system, ¡secretary
Southard, the prrsei t Secretary, and the late Sco-
Maiy (Mr Badger) had all recommended to Con-
gress therrorgamza ion of th department, in older
to obtain a proper accountab li tv in the expendi-
ture of the public money, whith it vas íound to
be utterly impossible to arrive at by any other
m ans.
In  order to show how reasonable had been the
complaints of the Secretaries of the Navy, of the
want of a proper organization of the depar ment,
and how necessary   were the measures proposed
by them fir that object, and what would be the
effect of such a reorgan'zation, he would refer the
Hou e to the results produced in ihe army, by a re-
oiganizalion of the W?r Depar tnent   Up tr 1819,
the disbursements  were made  for  th"  arrrj,   as
ihei bad been for the navy, by appropria ions     In
1817, Mr. Calhoun   went  into  the   War Depart
mint, and, soon   discovering the wistefiil mode of
d aiming the public m< ney, pr< posed se/eral laws,
which were parsed   di eeiing the reo gaimation of
the  dep rtm nt     Tne  reoiganizati n commenced
in 1819, and was fuhy effected m  1823     In   ihe
year  1822  Mr   Calhiun   made  a  re,oit,  which
wculd  be  ftund  in H   drcs   18>2 and 1825, at
page 25, in which were to be fomd dr ailtd state-
ment , showing tf-e s tvmg thai h^d been tifected
in  the  various blanches of ihe ilefartmeit     By
this statement, it appeared thM in the a i unes a
MVBg   had been  made of §1 25, on   the eo t of
each musk t  marulactured  durug ihe   a lifar;
and upon the asg ega eamou t of  that arm, there

In   the   meoieal   department, ihe   Sur«ion   Gen-
