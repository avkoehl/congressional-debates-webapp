I have been waiting patiently for several days to get the tools ordered by the general to make boats and get out timber for platform. Have finally telegraphed and received the following reply:

NASHVILLE.

P. H. SHERIDAN:

the articles were ready to ship on the 17th transportation asked for. They have not left the store-house owing to want of transportation,there having been a peremptory order not to ship this kind of goods without an order. To get these shipped immediately,you will have to get an order from chief quartermaster, Colonel Taylor.

Please get me the order.
