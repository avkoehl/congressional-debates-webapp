departments to join their proper commands. At the same time I notified Brigadier-General Patrick, provost-marshal-general of the Army of the Potomac, of the presence at Camp Parole of about 1,500 exchanged troops belonging to the Army of the Potomac and to day an officer has reported to me by his order to take charge of them and conduct them to the army. The within report of the number of men at Camp Chase and Benton Barracks is based on the number sent to those stations from Camp Parole and includes the officers recently ordered West. It is probable there are many absentees.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., May 10, 1863.

Brigadier General A. SCHOEPF,

Commanding Fort Delaware, Del.

GENERAL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 5th and 6th instant with estimate for new barracks, and your letter of the 7th reporting changes in the old barracks. Orders have already been given by the Quartermaster-General to Colonel Crosman, assistant quartermaster-general at Philadelphia, in relation to the erection of the barracks. If the changes you are making in the old barracks are only in raising the floors and repairing the bunks and windows it is not necessary to refer the matter to the Quartermaster-General; but if you propose to open the square by cutting through the barracks on two sides of the square and to run a cross-line of barracks as was proposed it will be necessary to submit the plan for the approval of the Quartermaster-General. I will ask authority for the construction of a hospital on your estimate. Your letter of the 8th instant is received and your recommendation will be attended to.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Washington, D. C., May 10, 1863.

Colonel T. P. ANDREWS,

Paymaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

COLONEL: By direction of the Secretary of War please give the necessary orders to enable officers who have recently been exchanged and who are now in Annapolis and Baltimore to receive the pay that is due them or so much of it as may be necessary to meet their present wants. Most of these officers are in Baltimore, being the officers mentioned in my note of last evening, and it is desirable if possible that they should be paid in that city. I inclose herewith a list* of the officers referred to, many of whom have already gone West and will not apply for pay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
