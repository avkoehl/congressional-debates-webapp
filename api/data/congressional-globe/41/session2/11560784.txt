THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26,
to specie payments at once. It is a proposi-
tion to extend the national bank circulation
$200,000,000, and in order to prevent an infla-
tion of the currency to retire an equal amount
of greenbacks. Now, these greenbacks can
only be retired by payment in gold, or at the
option of the holder by funding them in some
Government security; but in whichever way
they be retired they pass out of circulation,
and thus at one swoop you take more than
half, nearly two thirds, of the legal-tenders of
the country out of circulation, and to that
extent you lessen the ability of the people to
pay their debts in what is now the currency in
which debts are contracted and in which they
are ordinarily paid.
If, then, there is to be an indication of relief
to the people in the way of equalizing currency
the proposition of the Senator from Massachu-
setts makes that dependent upon another propo-
sition which will inflict a hundredfold more
injury upon the people than any increase or
equalization of the currency can do good. I
am no enemy to a resumption of specie pay-
ments at the proper time. I was educated in
a hard money school. I believe in hard money,
and dislike paper money; but I do not believe
in an instant resumption of specie payments,
or any such monstrous "Stride toward it as is
contemplated by the amendment of the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. So much for that.
Aud now, sir, a few words upon the bill itself.
I do not propose to go into any general discus-
sion of financial questions; I propose to con-
fine myself to this bill; and indeed, after the
remarks that I have heard from my colleague
to-day, I almost concluded to forego saying
anything at all, for he spoke with so much
spirit and with so much justice, I think, in the
mass of what he said as to leave very little to
say.
This bill, as has been said, is twofold. The
first two sections profess to attempt an equal-
ization of the currency ; the remaining three
sections authorize free banks limited only by
two things: limited first by the extent of the
bonded debt of the United States, and second
by the ability of the banks to maintain specie
payments. It is perfectly obvious, therefore,
that whenever we arrive at specie payments, if
this bill shall become a law, you may have just
as many banks in this country as can get cur-
rency by deposit of the bonds of the Govern-
ment. The first limit is the bonds of the Gov-
ernment, $2,000,000,000 or more. The second
limit is their ability to maintain specie pay-
ments. I will not say how many banks would
be organized under th'13 hill when wc return to
specie payments; but it is easy to see that
they would be everywhere ; and it is as easy to
see that the amount of their circulation no man
can foretell, for I wish the Senate to mark that
there is no limit whatever to the circulation of
the banks that may be organized underthe third
section of this bill except the two I have men-
tioned. Their circulation cannot extend be-
yondeighty percent, of the Government bonds
they may deposit; and in practice it would not
extend beyond their ability to maintain specie
payments. With these two limitations upon
it they may add $500,000,000 or more to the
circulation of the country if they can main-
tain specie payments on such an issue as that.
Now, sir, it does seem to me that this part
of the bill has not attracted the attention that
it deserves. It does seem to me that it is one
of the most important measures in a financial
point of view ever presented to the Senate ;
that it is a measure of immense magnitude
whether or not you shall inaugurate a free bank-
ing system upon public stocks that shall per-
meate everyneighborhoOll of the United States.
I do not intend at this time to express my
views upon that point further than to intimate
that, I do not like such a system. I do not
like it because of its political effects ; I do not
like it because it is one of the most powerful
of all the agencies that can be employed to
consolidate a'l the powers of Government in the
hands of Congress. I do not like it for another
reason, because the directand inevitable tend-
ency of such a system is to perpetuate the
public debt, to make it the interest of every
banker in the country who holds stock in these
banks to perpetuate the public debt in order
that he may enjoy his banking privileges.
But I do not propose to go into that. I think
these three sections of the bill ought not to be
in the bill. I think there is no necessary con-
nection between them and the first two sections
of the bill. The first two seetions.of the bill
are for the purpose of equalizing the currency.
What necessary connection is there between
them and a measure to authorize free banking
in the country? I can see none, or at least
none so close as to incorporate these two sub-
jects in the same bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. Will my colleague allow
me to answer that point?
Mr. THURMAN. With great pleasure.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is proper that it should
be put and proper that it should be answered.
It is very manifest that if these coin notes are
to be authorized to be issued and such bauks
authorized to be organized in California, to
the extent that they are organized they will
relieve the necessity of the distribution of cur-
rency to California and the other Pacific States.
That was the view taken by the representa-
tives of the Pacific coast, and also in the city of
New York, and Charleston, and New Orleans,
that it would be just the same as if we raised
the amount of increased bank circulation to
$60,000,000, allowing$ 15,000,OOOforthesecoin
note banks. We estimate that $15,000,000 will
fill the channels of circulation in certain parts
of the country and you thus make the $45,000,-
000 provided for in the bill go further. It was
not expected that during the suspension of
specie payments these coin banks would be
organized to an amount probably exceeding
fifteen millions, depending on how far the peo-
ple of California should choose to adopt that
system, aud beyond question they will be organ-
ized in New York. That is the answer.
Mr. THURMAN. If that were all right, still,
it seems to me, these three sections ought to
have no place in this bill, but ought to be the
subject of a separate bill. But really this is
the first time I have known that anybody in the
gold States—in Nevada, in California, or in
Oregon—wanted any ofyour banking privileges
at all. They are not the people who are com-
plaining of the unequal distribution of the cur-
rency. They want nothing to do with your
currency. T'liey have a far better currency than
yours ; and if they want gold notes they can
have gold notes easily enough. Their banks
which they have there already can issue gold
notes, or certificates of deposit payable in gold,
which would pass as a currency; but they want
none of your paper money. They have the best
of all possible money; they have the real gold,
and they want nothing else, at least so far as
my observations go. I had the pleasure of
being in California last summer and of talking
there with many business men who were
extremely polite to all visitors there, and I
never heard one man suggest for a moment that
he wanted any of your national bank currency.
But if it were so now would it justify you in
saying that for the temporary purpose of equal-
izing the currency a little you should put into
this bill a proposition to authorize for all time
to come free and unlimited banking in the
United States under an act of Congress? It
seems to me that these three sections have 110
place in the bill, and I hope they will be
stricken out.
Now, sir, as to the first part of the bill, that
portion of it which proposes to equalize the
currency, I think the Senator from Massachu-
setts has most properly characterized that as an
ineffectual measure. The simplest statement
in the world will show how ineffectual it is.
New England, with less than one tenth of the
population of the Union, has more than one
third of the circulation. Now, sir, if you add
$45,000,000 to the circulation it will then be
$345,000,000; call it in round numbers $350,-
000,000, and what then will be the proportion
of New England? You do not talcea dollar from
her, and she will still have more than two sev-
enths of the circulation, nearly one third of it.
She now has a little over one third ; add your
$45,000,000, and she still, with less than one
tenth the population of the country, will have
nearly one third of the circulation of the coun-
try, not by the operation of the laws of trade,
but that one third obtained under an act of
Congress and under what my colleague most
conclusively demonstrated the other day was
an illegal administration of an act of .Congress.
You do nothing in the world to rectify that
evil. Under laws that were unjust because of
their unequal distribution, and under an illegal
administration of those laws that doubled the
injustice, you permit that injustice to remain
and you offer some sort of a douceur to the
western and the southern States not to com-
plain of it. That is the whole of the first part
of this bill. Instead of being a bill to equalize
the currency it is a bill to prevent its equali-
zation; it is a bill to make it more difficult in
the future to equalize it.
My friend and colleague in the opening
speech that he made on this bill, with singular
felicity, with remarkable brevity and perspicu-
ity, showed how unequal this distribution of
the currency is, and how- it has resulted in
great part from an illegal administration of the
law. Let me, however, add a little to what he
said on that subject. I will do it in a very
few minutes. The basis of what I shall say is
in a table which I have compiled with very
great care and circumspection :
