HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 27, 1864-8.25 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER, Commanding:

In the present reduced force under my command, and the amount of work yet to be done on the main line, I suggest that work on the redoubt near Curtis' house be suspended for the present. I do not see any use of the redoubt, for if the main line is ever carried this redoubt will not stop and enemy's pursuit.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
