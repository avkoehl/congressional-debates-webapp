(Received 4 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

When deemed necessary by the Governor and General Couch the Governor will call such troops as they may think sufficient to serve in Pennsylvania and Maryland under the command of General Couch for a term not extending 100 days. These troops shall be mustered into the service of the United States. The Governor and General Couch may alter this clause by substituting the service of the State, if they shall deem it expedient. The troops thus called shall be transported, armed, clothed, equipped, subsisted, and paid directly by the United States, and the quartermasters, commissaries, paymasters, and other officers of the United States will be instructed accordingly. The above plan has been settled by us, subject to the approval of the War Department.

A. G. CURTIN and

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The join dispatch forward you by Governor Curtin and myself has been agreed upon by us as well as by the members of his council, Honorable William Meredith, Colonel Wright, &amp;c. In case many troops are to be raised in this State for its defense I believe that the plan proposed to you is the best one that can be devised. I do not deem it necessary to enter into a lengthy explanation, believing that you, from your knowledge of the State, are much better acquainted with the sentiment of the people than I am myself. It is just reported that our pickets reach from Hagerstown to the river crossing.
