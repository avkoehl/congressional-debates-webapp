Wednesday night, the further management of the case was left in my hands. The solicitor-general of Canada came to Windsor on Thursday, and in a conversation between him, the county attorney at Windsor, Mr. Emmons, and myself, we were assured taht the Canadian government would spare no pains in arresting the men, and it was even hinted that a reward would be offered for their apprehension. In connection with this, I inclose a copy of a letter* received from Mr. Macdonell, the county attorney of Essex County.

On consultation with Colonel Hill, the assistant provost-marshal-general of this State, it was determined that as soon as the Philo Parsons, which had resumed her regular trips, returned from Sandusky, two of their crew, with the constable at Windsor and a detective from Detroit, should be sent to Toronto, where it is suspected that most of the party are still remaining. The Philo Parsons returned on Thursday night, and the men were dispatched on Friday. Nothing, however, has been heard from them as yet. I will here remark that I have been informed that at the time the Philo Parsons was moored to the dock at Sandwich two men, who were seen staving a hole in her cabin and taking out a piano and other furniture, were arrested by the custom-house officer at that place for importing goods without a permit. This furniture, the property of the owners of the boat, has been guarded by the custom-house authorities with scrupulous fidelity, while the pirates were released without delay, although the evidence against them must have been overwhelming. I inclose herewith copied of the affidavits+ of James Denison, engineer, and Michael Campbell, wheelman of the Philo Parsons.

Besides the warrant for piracy already spoken of, I have prepared others for robbery and assault with intent to murder, for use in case the complaint for piracy cannot be sustained.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

H. B. BROWN,

For ALFRED RUSSELL,

U. S. District Attorney.
