transports, not containing, however, many troops. They had some long boats or lanches; but, so far as observed, amide no preparation for landing. The fire on both sides was skillfully directed, and continued up to about 1 p. m., when the steamers hauled off, and, it is supposed, in a partially disabled condition. I took all the available forces, comprising the four companies of infantry and one of cavalry, from this vicinity, and Colonel Bate's Tennessee (Walker) Legion with me, reaching the Potomac soon after the firing ceased. The conduct of the troops in the batteries-that of Captain Walker, with his 6-pounder rifle-guns, having been brought early into the action-is represented as having been admirable, including the covering and protecting force on the field. I have transferred the Tennessee (Walker) Legion to Brooke's Station, where I have re-established Camp Jackson. From that point lateral movements may be easily made to cross the coasts, and forward movements to cover the batteries, with great facility.

The ladies are now making tents, cartridges, and belts, and I hope so to have our forces sheltered and better equipped. I left Aquia Creek late last evening, and return there this morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIR: I have the honor to state, for the information of the commanding general, that four of the enemy's armed steamers commenced firing on our batteries at Aquia Creek yesterday morning, at about 9 o'clock, and continued until about 4 p. m. On our side nobody was hurt and no material damage was done to our batteries. The enemy gave no indications of an intention to land, but hauled off to the Maryland shore at the close of the action. This demonstration, thus persevered in, is made, I doubt not, in view of collateral action and movements. I arrived on the field about midday, and returned to this place at night. The batteries were commanded by Captain Lynch and other naval officers. The conduct of my entire, force under the command of Colonel Bate, of the Walker Legion, until my arrival on the field, was admirable throughout the day. The enemy is represented to have thrown five hundred and ninety-seven shots and shells and our battery, under Captain Lynch, seventy-five.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Colonel, Provisional Army, Commanding Forces.

Colonel R. S. GARNETT, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces.

P. S.- The colors were cut away from one of the enemy's ships by a shot from our battery.
