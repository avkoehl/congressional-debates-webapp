INDIANAPOLIS, August 12, 1863.

Major-General BURDSIDE:

Your dispatch received. Just returned from Cincinnati,where I hoped to see you on several points. The Michigan sharpshooters,you will remember,are in Michigan for some purpose. In regard to Seventy-first Indiana, I will make as speedy arrangements as possible to hold them at your service,but I have 3,200 prisoners to guard, and the provost-marshal is constantly demanding troops. Nearly 200 now out of the Seventy-firs on their duty. The regiment is also making arrangements to get mounted. The carbines,&amp;c.,have been shipped and are now on the way for them. General Ammen calls to -day for 150 men in Illinois. I cannot send at present. Would not the Seventy-first answer your purpose better after it is mounted?I will make every arrangement for emergencies and get along here with as little as possible. Please answer with regard to Seventy-first.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
