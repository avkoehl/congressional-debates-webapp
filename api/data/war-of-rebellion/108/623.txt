QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, VIRGINIA FORCES,

Lynchburg, Va., September 17, 1862.

His Excellency JOHN LETCHER,

Governor of Virginia:

GOVERNOR: Referring to my letter of this date inclosing summary statements from this office showing the receipts and expenditures of money and property on account of the State troops under Major-General Floyd, I have now to inclose a statement showing the purchases of property on same account by Captain J. B. Goodloe, acting assistant quartermaster and commissary of subsistence at Wytheville. By reference to statement B from this office, it will be seen that I have advanced this officer the sum, of $174,900. He reports expenditures, on all accounts, to 15th instant, at $92,062.78. A large portion of the residue is doubtless in the hands of his agents, expended or to be expended by them in the purchase of necessary supplies for the State troops- the accounts not being yet reported to Captain G [oddloe] the amount thus used and to be used appears as in his hands. On the 16th instant, at the request of Major-General Floyd, I appointed Captain J. F. Alvey, an acting assistant quartermaster and commissary to accompany the command. Having executed a bond and taken the oaths of office, as required by law, I placed in his hands, as requested by General F[loyd], the sum of $13,000, applicable to the payment of expenses growing out of the movement of the troops.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. R. SMOOT,

Major and Quartermaster in Charge.
