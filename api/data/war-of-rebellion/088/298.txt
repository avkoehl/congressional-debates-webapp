GENERAL: My lookout at the plank road station reports that at 5 p. m. a battalion of infantry came into view to the left of the leadworks and halted, the rear being still covered. Four mounted men, apparently officers, were at the head and moved on to our left. Owing to the rain further observations could not be made. The lookout was of the opinion that it was the head of a column of troops.
