On leave given, Mr FILLMORE from the Committee of
Ways and Mean's reported a bill makiii"r appropriations for
certain fortifi \ ions of the Unite i tetates for the yeai 1842
which «aid bill was read twice, and referred to the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr FILLMORE, from the same committee, íeported the fol
lowing resolution
Resolved, That the Committee of Ways and Meant* be dis
charged from the further consideration of so much of (he esti
mate of af piopuations for the year 1842 for fortifications and

Mr PENDLETON submitted an inquiry to Mr Fill-more
which the Repr iter could not hear but the pjrportof which
may be inferred fnm the answer of
Mr FILLMORE which was that the Commi tee of Ways
and Means hid not felt authorized to act on these matters of
appropriation until the Committee on Mihtaty Vffairs (which
was the appropriate committee of refeience) ha Ifust examined
and approved them
Mi PENDLETON was understood tn qav that the worsts

pairs
Mr FILLMORE admittel fully the importance of the*e

that he might have  n opportunity simply of presenting three
or four propo Uiona m writing, having reference to this eub«
ject He deemed it due to the subject, and due to the Con^ti-
tu ion todo rhi% and it was not 111 defence of the gentleman
from Massachusetts
5Vi B01 fa was undeistoodtoi Himatethathe wo ildrheer-
fully accede to this request, (as the gentleman merely denned
to read his pi opo HionSj) if objection should be made m no
othtr quaiter
Mr MERIWETHER said something, (not cistinc'ly heard
by the Reponer ) but amounting 11 an objection
So Mr BOTTS declined to withdnw themmon
[ The following are the pi opositons wh cli Mi BAR^AR0^3 *
euedtt read as *he result and t onclu^ior of hi& views on
the&ubject befóte the House, he having had no opportunity to
expieos his views to-the House in any other way
I   That thp pennon in th a case is nothing more than the
hasty and ill considered expression of opinion on the part of
thesigneia that the Union, as at pie°ent composed, cannot be
kept together, and that measures ought therelore to be taken
immediately lor a peaceable separation instead of waiting for
the day of violence an 1 civil war
II   That the petitíoneis had a pel feet constitutional right to
send su h a j em on to Congress, and any m mber of this
House had a perfect constitutional right to ofier that petition
to the House, md to advocate ihe views and sutemems of fha
petitioners t n this flooi if he should see fit to do eo The
Ho ise, in thQ mean time, had a periect constitutional right
toieceiveand entertain the petition, or to reiu«etoeutertain
it
III    That in presenting tms petition to the House, the mover
hasdore r o more than if, without any petition he had offered
to thei ouse a resolution of his own t© the effect of the instruc-
tion otíeied by him on piesenung the petition viz thatase
lect com nittee be appointed to diaw >ip and ieport to th©
House and through the Hou^e to state to ihe country, reasons
why measures ought not to be taken for the dissolution of the
Urn tn   this he had a perfect ught to do
IV   That the a'tempt to convert this petition and ihe expres-
sion oí opinions contained m it, into a high political offen^
and to make that offence triable before any tribunal and eepa-
ciaHy to makeit triable before this body, sets the Constitution
of the count' y and ever; known principle of law and liberty ai
utter dehance ard is deeply offensive to the understanding of
the Hondean íthe country It is, moreover, an attempt to set
up the Repiesontative body above the constitueit body, and
nuke the firmer the self constituted censois of the political
conduct and opinions 01 the latter, with power to punish for
such conduct and opinions atdi^cieiion
\ That the attempt to involve and mdentify a member of this
House presenting a petition, with the \ etitioneis and their pe-
culm sciitnncii t, an I views no witl s anding his most explicit
disavowals and to lull 1 mi amenable fo the letubUivejus
tice d pov,et of ti e House on 111 pie ended ground of con
tempt, is a hi«h handed and danr¿ attempt—agioss hi each of
the pnvi eg * an 1 ndt| endence of tnat men bet—a leep in
