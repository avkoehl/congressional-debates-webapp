SAINT JOSEPH, October 18, 1864--12.30 p. m.

Captain FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

Captain Holloway's colored servant just arrived here from Glasgow; says that Price attacked that place on the morning of the 15th instant at 5 o'clock. Our forces were about 600 strong, without artillery. By 11 a. m. the place was completely surrounded and full of rebels, and he thinks our forces surrendered, as the fighting ceased about that time.

A. J. HARDING,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

(Same to Lieutenant-Colonel Stark.)

SAINT JOSEPH, October 18, 1864--4.13 p. m.

Captain FRANK ENO, Saint Louis:

Your dispatch of 14th instant just received. The forces at this post consist of four companies Forty-fourth Missouri Infantry and about 500 irregular militia. Stragglers from Glasgow report that Colonel Harding and command fought desperately, but were overpowered and compelled to surrender after severe loss.

A. J. HARDING,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

SAINT JOSEPH, October 18, 1864.

Captain FRANK ENO, Saint Louis:

Ridgeley, Platte County, Mo., was captured and plundered by guerrillas on the night of the 16th instant. Smithville, Clay County, was burned last night by same band--Chiles'. Soldiers, just arrived at Weston from Liberty, report 500 rebels at Missouri City yesterday.

A. J. HARDING,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 18, 1864--5.55 p. m.

Lieutenant A. J. HARDING, Saint Joseph:

The major-general commanding says he don't believe the story about Missouri City. General Curtis telegraphs from Kansas City to-day and don't mention it. It is Jackman's force that it over the river, and they are not more than half armed. All you have to do is to fight hard and don't be afraid. Let enemy come close and shoot low. No surrender.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

SAINT JOSEPH, October 18, 1864.

Major CHARLOT:

Colonel Shanklin reports rebels evacuated Carrollton to-day, 400 marching on Richmond, Ray County, and 400 eastward. Have you any information of any of Mower's command being on this side of the river?

A. J. HARDING,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
