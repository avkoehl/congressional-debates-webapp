THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 15,
have shown a deficiency of §55,918,460, whilst
the public debt has increased but $37,000,000,1
answer that on the 30th of June, 1857, there wag
a balance in the Treasury of $17,710,000, which,
spreading itself through the four years, has been
exhausted; and in consequence, the public debtis
so much less than the aggregate of the deficiencies
I present.
So much, Mr. President, for the years 1858,
1859, and 1860. If there be in these tables any
error, I should like exceedingly to have it pointed
out. It is divested of all the complications, and
we start for the year 1861 with only $485,000 in
the Treasury. For 1861 I think the estimates of
the Secretary quite too sanguine. As for the bal-
ance in the Treasury, I have shown that it has
been exhausted. The Secretary estimates the cus-
toms at $60,000,000, the public lands at $4,000,000,
and miscellaneous ^purees at $,2,225,000—a total
of $66,925,000. For the year just closed, we have
seen that the same sources yielded as follows:
customs, $53,946,000; public lands, $1,861,000;
miscellaneous, $1,102,000—making a total of
$56,910,000. The Secretary estimates for an in-
crease of $9,315,000 for the coming year. Is this
reasonable ? Can we depend upon it with safety ;
Certainly we cannot. What is there to warrant
the conclusion that we shall have $60,000,000 from
customs? Theindicationsfavora reduction,rather
than an increase. I have a statement from the
Treasury showing that the receipts for 1859 ex-
ceed those of 1860 over forty-seven thousand dol-
lars, indicating that wc aie actually running back
instead of getting an increase of $9,000,000. I
think it would be the utmost point that we dare
to venture if we put the receipts from customs for
the coming year at $56,500,000, the public lands
at $2,250,000, and the miscellaneous sources at
$] ,500,000—making a total of $60,250,000. This
would be a handsome increase on the preceding
years. For instance: these same sources, in 1858,
yielded $46,557,000; in 1859,$52,886,000; in 1860,
$56,560,000; and then my estimate for 1861 is
$60,250,000. That is a gradual increase, and a
reasonable one; but lean see no reliable basis on
which we arc to estimate the vast increase which
it is necessary to have in order to sustain the
position taken by my friend from Virginia.
In order to avoid all complication as to the state
of the finances at the close of the year 1861,1 do
not propose to strike a balance; but I shall sim-
ply present the estimates of the Secretary of the
.Treasury, •and what we have voted on in addi-
tion, and other demands which we know must
necessarily come upon the Treasury. The Sec-
retary estimates for permanent payments, such
as the interest on the public debt, the collection
of customs, &c., $8,173,582. Then there are ap-
propriations made by law prior to the meeting of
the present Congress, say $12,262,452, and he
estimates for new appropriations $46,278,893,
making an aggregate ot $66,714,928; exhausting
at once the whole probable income for the year,
and $6,000,000 m addition.
Now, Mr. President, what have we done above
and beyond that estimate? There are some things
which I am about to present here that may not
turn out to ho entirely accurate, but they are tho
best approximation that can be made:
Jfcxiraordinetry eiul not estimated for, but which have passed
one branch or the other of Cong) ess.
Wundiy pilvate and public claims .$1,200,000
For the completion of water works  000,000

Purchase of public grounds    168,000

District ot Columbia jail, See  300,000
Pail of the light-house appropriation  350^000
Widows* pension bill from the IIou«e  1,200,000
This is no fancy sketch. These sums have
Eassed one or both branches of Congress. It may
c said that it is not certain that they will all
finally pass. What has that to do with settling
this financial question? If they do not pass tins
session, they will the next, and are all expendi-
tures that must be met; and we may as well look
our liabilities square in the face.
But that is not all. The estimates presented
by the Secretary of the Treasury are §9,600,000
less than the total estimatesof all the Departments,
and of that sum only $4,550,000 is included in the
extraordinary appropriations which havepassed
one branch of Congress or the other. The re-
mainder will be coming along in due time. Only
the other day, alaw which was passed some three
or four years since, authorizing the purchase of
a location for a post office at New York, was
cxccuted, and under that you will have to pay
$500,000; and you will find all these claims com-
ing along in an equal ratio with the increase of
revenue upon which my friend from Virginia re-
lies.
But, sir, there are still other things. There is
a vast amount in the background that has been
pressed, and in reference to which, Senators have
taken their position. There is $1,600,000due to
the States, which has twice passed this body with
the approbation of the chairman of the Committee
on Finance. Then there is the Florida claim for
$1,500,000, which the Senator from Georgia thinks
just, and will no doubt have to be paid. Then
comes the Indian department, and my friend from
Arkansas, with his Choctaw claim of $>2,300,000,
and which wanted but two votes of getting on one
of your appropriation bills. But that is not all
that belongs to the Indian department, if you are
going to calculate for the future. There still re-
mains, as you will sec on page 312of your Finance
Report, over thirteen million dollars which you
have to pay under Indian treaties in the future,
fulling due at different dates. Then there is a
claim above any I have mentioned, which my
venerable friend from Kentucky [Mr. Critten-
den,] thinks is right, amounting to some five
million dollars. I believe it passed oncc since I
have been a member of this body. Indeed, I
think nearly all tho older statesmen regard it as
a claim that is right and ought to be paid. I have
reference to the claim for French spoliations.
Here are demands that must come upon your
Treasury, to .say nothing of the Pacific railroad,
which the Senators from California and Oregon,
and myself, would he very willing to fasten upon
the Treasury for a few millions—say about iifty
or sixty—as an advance on mail service.
But this picture would not be complete, if wc
did not stop to look at the $20,000,000 of public
debt now floating through the country. I say
$20,000,000 m round numbers, because there are
but $31.'*,000 in the Treasury of the Treasury
notes—not equal to the interest that has accrued
on the outstanding notes. That is the condition
wc are in. Now, sir, I have no vanity about this
matter. If I have committed an error in this ac-
count, I did not intend to do it, and I do not see
how 1 could. I get all my information from the
Department; I take it from the*official records;
and yet the contrast is so striking between the
picture which I present and that of my friend from
Virginia, that it seems to be almost incompre-
hensible that sensible men should separate so
widely.
The Senator from Virginia estimates a possible
excess in the Treasury, at the close of the coming
year, of twelve or sixteen million dollars. Now,
I do not care, as I said the other day, to consider
thft particular time of payment. That would only
complicate my exhibition. It is only when you
take the entire incomc from permanent and relia-
ble sources, and deduct from that ordinary and
unavoidable expenditures, that you find out ex-
actly what the Treasury is doing. I know the
Senator from Georgia would say that that would
bung us very near right; that it would seem to
show some hope of escape; but then that word
tc oidinaryought to be converted into extraor-
dinary;" it becomes more extraordinary every
year, and the extraordinary expenses which do
not belong to the ordinary operations of the De-
partment we may as well make up our minds to
look at, and be prepared for, as not. It is the
experience of all civilized nations—it will be the
experience of this country—as we grow larger and
the population moie numeious, our expenditures
will be greater; and I am mistaken if ours, counted
upon the basis of population, is not the cheapest
Government in the world.
Now, sir, I have gone through with this pic-
ture of the finances. Next, as to the public debt,
which we have made m time of peace, and which
we universally agree, is bad policy; which the Sec-
retary ofthcTveasury condemns, and says should ;
not be entertained for one moment. We have jj
$65,000,000 of public debt. The interest on that n
annually is no inconsiderable sum. Now, I sug-
gest whether the case I have stated is not a war-
rant to any Senator, who is unwilling to make a
public debt in time of peace, to vote against the
motion of the Senator from Virginia. I address
myself now to that class of Senators who hold as
a principle, and a right principle, that dutiesmust
be assessed for the purpose of revenue alone;
who would, at the same time, say a public debt
must not be created in time of peace. I say they
will violate that principle; they will not have as-
sessed the necessary duties to meet the necessary
expenses of the Government, and they will vio-
late the other great principle by making a public
debt in time of peace. It was violated in 1858,
1859, and 1860; and I fear it will be in 1861.
I shall not attempt to follow the Senator from
Virginia through his argument as to the details of
the bill. I hardly expected he would go int© such
an elaborate view of them on the motion to post*
pone. There is one thing that he did most un-
questionably establish, and that is, that he never
could be better prepared for the examination of
the bill than now; he never could have more ma-
terial before him; and so far as the information,
the statistics, the calculations made by the im-
porters of New York, and the facts and figures
from the Treasury are concerned, they only go
to show that the Senator from Virginia is ready
to act now. I say there is no escape from imme-
diate action, unless he shows that the revenue is
not required for the purposes of the Government.
He flatters himself into the belief that additional
revenue is not required. Every Senator here
knows that I express a difference of opinion with
that Senator with the utmost diffidence and reluc-
tance; for no man in this land has a larger share
of my confidence and respect; but, for tne life of
me, I cannot understand how he and the Secre-
tary of the Treasury arrive at the conclusion to
which they seem to adhere with so much tenacity.
As I said the other day, I do not care to take ex-
ception to the estimates, and say they are not
skillful. It docs not belong to human foresight
to understand the operations of 'commerce and
trade; they arc controlled by impulse that no man
can foresee. I may remark further, that the esti-
mates for the last year fall off*, as has been stated
by the Senator from Virginia, about three and a
half million. That is bad enough; but the other
side of the picture is worse; the one of which my
friend from Georgia speaks so much—that is, tho
expenditures. It is there that the Senator from
Virginia will fail in his expectations.
_ Mr. President, I have manifestly placed the es-
timate for customs at the highest point it will bear,
say $56,500,000, and the total revenues of the next
year at $60,000,000; but I am not satisfied, nor do
I think Congress ought to be satisiied, with simply
meeting the cm rent demands on the Treasury and
arresting the increase of debt. If wc have erred
in allowing the creation of a public debt in time
of peace—and I do not know that I should say
"erred," because every intelligent man knows
that this debt was brought upon us by a sudden
revulsion in commercial affairs—it was unavoid-
able,as our revenueswere suddenly cut down by
that revulsion of trade and business; but the fact
exists, and, as it does exist, it is for us to find a
remedy. I therefore go beyond this question of
meeting the current expenses and arresting the
creation of public debt, which 1 have shown will
not be arrested under the present rates, of duties,
and look for means to pay the debt already cre-
ated. T undertake to say, sir, that with a rate of
duty but a fraction over fourteen per cent, upon
the aggregate imports into the country, you can-
not raise, for any considerable term of years, the
means of meeting the ordinary expenses of the
Government. It requires an importation above
what the country is able to take. If the Sec-
retary's estimate for the coming year be real-
ized, you will hare an aggregate importation of
$420,000,000, whilst that of the year 1859 was but
$338,000,000. I have regarded the capacity of
the country to consume and pay for foreign goods
as a fundamental principle in this theory. On
that subject wc have the experience of thirty-nine
years, which shows that the average consumption
of foreign goods per cupita'm thaVmtcdSiaics dur-
ing that time was §6 72, ranging from $4 50 up to
$11—being the highest in 1836, and again in 1857,
1858, and 1859. Any man who will take the tables
and take the time to examine them, will see this
