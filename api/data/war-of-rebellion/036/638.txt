small-arms.

Marched on the 13th, at 6 a. m., for Jackson, via Clinton Crocker in the advance. Major-General Sherman's command arriving before mine had left the town, was ordered to take the direct road to Jackson. Moved on cautiously toward Clinton, my cavalry being ordered to keep well out on my left flank, and entered the town at 2 p. m. without opposition. A regiment of infantry, under the immediate supervision of Captain A. Hickenlooper, FIFTH Ohio Battery, chief engineer of the corps, was set to work to destroy the railroad as far WEST of Clinton as possible that night, and to proceed along the line of it the next day during our march toward Jackson, tearing in up wherever practicable, burning the ties, bending the iron, destroying bridges, culverts,&amp;c.

On the 14th, Crocker in the advance, marched toward Jackson at 5 a. m., major-General Sherman moving on his route at about the same time. Engaged the enemy's pickets about 5 miles from Jackson, and drove them in about 9 a. m., and pushed on until within 2 1/2 miles from the city, where the enemy was found posted in strong force, under the command of General W. H. T. Walker. Some of the troops consisted of South Carolina and Georgia regiments, which had only arrived the evening before, and had been immediately marched out and placed in position at the point where the battle took place. The position of the enemy was carefully reconnoitered, and Lieutenant J. W. MacMurray's battery (M), First Missouri, of Parrot guns, brought up to reply to their artillery, which had already opened on our lines. While the dispositions for the attack were being made, a very heavy shower set in, which delayed the attack for an hour and a half, the rain coming down in such torrents that there was great danger of the ammunition being spoiled if the men opened their cartridge-boxes.

The time, however, was well employed in putting the troops in position and bringing up Logan's DIVISION as a reserve. The enemy occupied a semicircular ridge stretching across the main road, his right holding a piece of woods, and his center and left commanding rolling ground in his front, over which it would be necessary to pass to attack him. Two batteries were in position, one covering the road and the other near his left, having a good range across the open field.

The disposition of my troops was as follows: Boomer; s brigade on the left of the road, in the timber; Holmes' brigade on his right, in the open fields; Sanborn's brigade on the right of Holmes', with skirmishers well out on his flank; John E. Smith's brigade, Logan's DIVISION, in the woods in rear of Boomer about 400 yards, in column of regiments, as a reserve; Stevenson's brigade was thrown across a ravine on Boomer's left, with directions to advance and gain a road which entered the city form the northwest; Dennis' brigade remained a short distance in rear, to guard the trains.

The rain having partially ceased, at 11 o'clock the advance was ordered, preceded by a heavy line of skirmishers. In a short time they were warmly engaged; drove back the enemy's skirmishers toward their main line and into a ravine filled with willows. Here the skirmishers halted for a few moments, and the enemy's fire becoming so heavy they could not advance any farther, they were recalled to their heavy they could not advance any farther, they were recalled to their regiments and a charge ordered. It was responded to with cheers and determination. Not a man faltered. The whole line swept forward in most perfect order, drove the enemy out of the ravine at the point of
