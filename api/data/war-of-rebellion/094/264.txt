HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, December 18, 1864.

Commander FORREST,Commanding U. S. Naval Forces, Bridgeport:

Major-General Thomas has ordered General Granger to occupy Decatur and the Decatur road. This is to prevent any attempt on the part of Hood to cross at that point. Your fleet will be most effective in preventing any crossing at that point. I therefor, in the name of General Thomas, beg your earnest co-operation with General Granger.

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, December 18, 1864.

(Received 19th.)

Brigadier General S. MEREDITH:

Yours of this day received.* The major-general commanding thinks it too late now for you to attempt to prevent Lyon crossing the Cumberland. McCook's division of cavalry is after him, and will be sufficient. Send the infantry up the Cumberland River to Nashville as quickly as possible.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General S. MEREDITH,

LEXINGTON, KY., December 18, 1864.

Brigadier General H. EWING,

Louisville, Ky.:

General Meredith telegraphs he is about to assume the offensive against Lyon with troops furnished him by Major-General Thomas. He reports Lyon's headquarters at Princeton, and his men scattered over the country in that vicinity.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 19, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

On reflection, I think it would have a good effect to allow Sherman's letter to General Halleck,+ except such facts as refer to future movements, to be published. It is refreshing to see a commander after a campaign of more than seven months' duration ready for still further operations, and without wanting any outfit or rest.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
