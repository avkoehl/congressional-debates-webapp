Fifth. It will be the duty of each division ordnance officer to know the particular kind and caliber of ammunition in each wagon of his train, so that there may be no delay when called on to issue.

In pursuance of these instructions you will immediately ascertain the quantity of ammunition required in your respective divisions to supply each man with 100 rounds (40 rounds in cartridge-boxes and 60 in wagons), and will at once make requisition for the quantity deficient.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. MORROW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, April 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper:

In view of the fact that I will have to make the initiative with 20,000 less men in McPherson's army than I estimated, I intend to order all McPherson's disposable force (20,000) and Garrard's cavalry (5,000) to Chattanooga, to start from a common center. I go forward to-morrow.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, April 27, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Chattanooga:

It will be impossible to get up McPherson's two veteran divisions in time, and instead of putting his force (20,000) with Garrard's cavalry, by way of Lebanon and Summerville, I will order all to Chattanooga, so we may start from a common center.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
