aing duties, ought to encourage the trade with
Prance, rather than with England.
Id the fourth place: articles the consumption of
•which among the people sound policy requires you
to diseourage, ought to be subjected to heavier du-
nes than those imposed upon articles the use of
which ought to be encouraged Who, for example,
would think of imposing the same ad valorem rate
«/duty upon French brandy and upon coffee?
la the fifth place: articles of verysmall bulk and
very great value—such as jewellery, diamonds, and
other precious stones—must be charged with a low
rate of duty, otherwise they will all be smuggled
into the country on the persons of individuals;
whilst, on the contrary, articles of great and
ponderous bulk, the original cost of which is
rifling, and whose chief value consists m the ex-
pense of transporting them to .your markets, ought
to be charged with a high rate of ad valorem
duty—otherwise they will produce little or'no reve-
nue. Coal is an example of such aa article. The
20 per cent, duty which it now pays, under the
compromise act, amounts only to about 40 cents
per ton, or less than one cent and a half per bushel,
although, under the act of 1816, it was subjected to
a revenue duty of five cents per bushel. Such are
the effects of a horizontal tariff.
Again, m imposing duties with a view to inci-
dental protection, discriminations ought to be made
in favor of manufactures, the raw material oí which
is a production of your own country, and more es-
peeially it it be an agricultural production. For
thii reason, the cotton, woollen, iron, and hemp
manufacture ought to be encouraged in preference
io manufactures the materials of which are derived
from foreign countries. You ought to discriminate
in favor of the manufacture of such articles as will
render yon independent in war Indeed, 1 might
state a thousand reasons for discrimination, which
prove conclusively that the Procrustean rule of a
uniform horizontal ad valoiem tariff of duties can
never be applied in adju.ting the revenue laws of
a great nation It is for such reasons that I voted
against the amendment of my friend from Arkan-
sas [Mr. Sevier] proposing a horizontal du'y of
25 per cent ; although I firmly believe that a tariff
might be easily adjusted, with proper discrimina-
tions, which would yield sufficient revenue to the
treasury, and afford sufficient incidental protection
to manufactures, without pxceedmg that average
rate.
But I am not only opposed to any uniform scale
of ad valorem dalles, but to any and all ad va-
lorem duties whatever, except in cases where, from
tfce nature of the article imported, it is not possible
to subject it to a specific duty. Our own severe
experience has taught us a lesson on this subject,
which we oogbt not soon to forget. I cannot re-
frain from briefly adverting to some of my rea-
sons for this opinion.
Our ad valorem system has produced great frauds
upon the revenue, whilst it has driven the regular
American merchant from the business of import-
ing, and placed it almost exclusively in the hands
of the agents of British manufacturers. The Amer-
ican importer produces his invoice to the collector,
containing the actual price at which his imports
were purchased abroad, and he pays ihe fair and
regular duty upon this invoice. Not so the British
agent. The foreign manufacturer, in his invoice,
reduces the price ot the articles which he intends
to import into oar country to the lowest possible
standard which he thinks will enable them to pass
through the custom-house without being seized for
fraud: and the business has been huheito managed
with so much ingenuity as generally to escape de
tection. The consequence is, that the British agent
passei the goods of his employer through the custom-
house on the payment of a much lower duty than
the far American merchant is compelled to pay
In this manner he is nndersold in ihp market by
ihe foreigner, and thus is driven from the a mpeti-
tioD, whjls' ihe public revenue is fraudulently re-
duced
A- ain- a i valorem  duties deprive ihe Ajericen
manuthc ur<r of nearly all the benefits ot irridei
tal pr< t eti n  when it is most required.    When
the bu íre^s of the country is de r"-"nd, as it i  it
piesent, and when the pnce of  fue'gn  artciet
sinks to far less than their cosí, your duty sinks in
the same proportion, and you are also deprived of
revenue at the time when it is most needed.
Our own experience, therefore, ought to have
convinced us that, whenever it is possible, from the
nature of the article, we ought to substitute speci-
fic for ad valorem duties These continue to be
the same npon the same articles, notwithftanding
the constant fluctuations in prices. They afford a
steady revenue to the country, and an equally
steady incidental protection. When commodities
are usually sold by weight or by measure, you
may always subject them to a specific duty; and
this ought always to be done
Let us, then, abandon the idea of a uniform hori.
zontal scale of ad valorem duties; and whether the
duties be high or low, let us return to the ancient
practice of the Government. Let us adopt wise
discriminations; and, whenever this can be done, im-
pose specific duties.
Then, sir, after maturely weighing all the argu-
ments both for and against the pre<ent bill;—after,
on the one side, considering the strong obj 'ctions to
it, and, on the other, contemplating the miserable,
the distressed, and the hopeless condition of the
people of this country, and the still more misera-
ble, distressed, and hopeless condition of the public
credit, in case this bill shou'd notpis«,—I have de-
termined that my vote shall not pievent it frcm be-
coming a law.
Mr SMITH of Connecticut observed that,   this
bill had for its object to promote the advantage of
any great portion of the community, without op-
pressirg or detracting from the best merest? of the
remainder, it shou'd have his vote. But that it
would have a directly contrary effect, would be sui
fieient excuse for his opposition to its pas age—
much as he deplored the condition of the Govern-
ment, and the discredit and dishonor of the coun-
try, brought about by the majority now in power
If due inquiry were made, it would be found that it
was in those^ectiors of ihe country whirebanUs,banl<
currency, and fictitious capital trust prevailed, that
publn* liberty was lowering in deca); and thst in
those --ections where they least prevailed, the true
pnnciples <f republicanism were man tamed in
their greatest puntj In those bank currency,
paper-money, fictitious capital sections, a'onewere
to be found misery, pauperism, destitu'ion, and
p ostration of ihe mee free and independent Amer-
ican population. Ihere alone would be found thp
sickly plants of hot-bed manufactories, incapable of
existing independently in the free and open air,
and ready to pen h if not fostered by the shelter
and artificial stimulants of a protecting Govern-
ment
Whence came the outcries about the distresses
of the country, and famishing laboiers? Was it
from the agriculturists of the country? Was it the
hatdy yeomanry who depended on their own
hands, their own unaided energies, and, in their
indomitable love of independence, dudam*d 'o
cringe and sopplcate for support at the expense
ot others? No, such men appreciated the true
American character too well to become suppli-
ants to power The^e outcries and complamu
came from a widely different, a degenerate, a
hot-bed clas=; or rather, from speculators and ma-
nopolists, who, for their own selfhh ends, raised up
th'se hot-beds, and fattened anu grew rich bpon
the labors wh ch wasted the energies ard destroy-
ed the true American ^\nt of their dependents
Por  the further ,-ggrandizement of such mo-
nopolists, he was now called upon to vote for this
bill     And what was its proposition! for ,t  ctuld
not be denied—indeed, it was now openly avowed—
that it was a measure for protection.    It is p prop
osition to tax  the  hardy freemen of this  Union,
who trust to their own industry alone for their sur
pert, and  make ihem   pay nearly double  prcefcr
every imported   arii-le  lhat   e ters  into  the dailv
eoii'iimption cf lh ir  faoiihes,  that ihe rich mo
popolists ma*  grow n her, a d  the r d per Vnu

Whe'e upssoch a system  to end  but ir, ¡h" d s
c a agement diminution, and des n r m   of  hat
hard  raee, best calclateJ to iiphi'd  rue repub
hcan institution! , and the mui ¡plication of diisto-
cratic   distinctions between wealthy monopolists
and pauperized dependents, which must soener or
later, if such a system is promoted by the General
Government, lead to the gradual decay and final
dissolution of public liberty. Could he then be
expected to vote for a measure which was calcu-
lated to foster and protect monopoly and depend-
ence, and to break down and oppress equality and
independence' No measure should receive bis
support, the result of which would be to build up
an aristocracy of monopolists, under the pretext
of protecting the laborers, whom they had re-
duced to the s at? of paupers Ii w?s not these
laborers who were to receive the benefits of this
protection, but their task-masters. This would be
but the building up of a power to sap the very foun-
dation oí the free institutions of the country It
was to stimulate a contest between those who live
upon their own labor, and those who live upon the
labor of others, with this difference—that the latter
were to have the bounty of the Government, and
the former were to stand the contest on their own
resources, under fearful odds.
Mr SIMMONS did not expect to hear any New Englander
traducing his own constituents Such, he endeavored at some
length to show, was the effect of the i crnarlrs made by the Sen-
ator from Connecticut He contended lhat the manufacturing
laborers of New England were as free, independent, intelligent*
and happy a race of citizens, as any in the world, and requneá
no fui ther protection from power than that which every Gov
ernment was bound to give to itb own citizens, so as lo place
Ihem in a condition to compele with the rival interests of
other couotiies That they were now in a state of destitution,
was tiie consequence of inadequate protection He depicted
the condition to which they would be reduced by a suspension:
of at! thur labors, shou'd Congress tail to pass some measure
of adequate revenue It was well known that he did not agree
widi all the friends of this bill m many particulars He was.
not as hostile to the ad valorem principle as the Senator from
Pennsylvania He believed lhat if it could be guarded against
fraud, it would, as a general principle, work advantageously
Tkeie should undoubtedly, he many exceptions to the general
principle He admitted that this was not a bill the best that
could be framed but he believed it would now be allowed that
it was ihe only measuie which, at this late period of the ses-
sion, would be likely to accomplish the mam object of provi-
ding revenue He objected to the seveial propositions of pro
vidwg for the piesent exigency by temporaiy measures He
considered fluctuating and unstable legislation destiuctive to the
industrial interests of the countiy Fn his opinion, there was
not time within the lew days winch Congiess had yet to remain
m session, to adjust the fai'fl m such a mannei as to give the
greatest possible satisfaction to the several interests concerned
iltit no one would contend that the courtry should be left with
out some revenue measure, the effect of which would be, that
there would be an inundalion ol foreign nnpoits to the detri-
ment of Ihe manufac urors of tl is countiy for yeais to come
Mi toMini 01 Connect cut made a few lemarks in reply tos
the teenatoi from Rhode 1=1 md to the effect lhat it would be a
pel version of h s meanii g to a-^ert that he disparaged the arti-
sans or mechanics of New E gland He appreciated themso-
highly, that he wi hed to see each a manufacturer himself, re
lying on his own industry and energy—and not ihe hot bed
dependent of astoveimnei t footeied monopolist
Mr HUNTINGTON observed that he felt sailed upon to say
something in relation to his constituents in consequence ot
what had fallen from his colleague, [Mi Smith] Mr H ar-
gue 1 at some length that the maoulacturing laborers of Con
necticut weie entitled to all the constitutional protection which
the General Government could extend to them Tt was the
want of this protection—to which they wcie entitled as Amen
can citi7ens—which alone could reduce them to that state of
pa J pei ism alluded to by his colleague
The fact that there was now no law either for protection or
leveiue, was sufficient to account for the destitution and mise-
ry of the industrial cías es of New England He referred to
instructions from bis colleague's constituents m favoi of protec-
tion, and asked how he could now stand up and say these man-
ufacturers were hot beds lhat shoul 1 be left to themselves, and
should not be fostered by the General Government He could
not agiee with «omt of his inends who seemed to 1 e opposed to
the pa=sagt of this bi ', he hoped upon leflection they would,
one and all, concentrate and suppoit it
Mr H made a brief review of the efforts of the Whig party,
since it came mio power, to benefit the countiy by great and
wholesome measures, and concluded by attributing the deplora-
ble condition of the country and the Government to the vetoes
of the Executive
Mi S\IITH of Connecticut observed that his colleague had,
no doubt, expressed what he believed to be the sentiments of
his coi stituenls He himself believed he did the same He
had no intention to oppose manufactmes He was friendly to
them But he was decidedly opposed to hot bed manufactures,
fo-teied by the General Givernment, in opposition to those
whose hands are tied by legislative action He believed that
the action of the Government ojght tobe such as to dispense
equal justice and equal lmmumtits to eveiy member of the
community anl not to one class, to (he piejudice of another
As to the ¡senator s allusion to his obedience to the instruction
of the State, he wou] 1 only say lhat he had acled in conformity
to that principle which tol 1 him it was his duty, as a represent-
ative, to obey the instructions of his state His colleague had,
in lee 1 shown that he was not governed by the same principle
i tie broad foundation on which he stood was equal rights—po-
ll ral civil, and serial He conceived it to be the true policy
of any fnc government to I reak down, and not to build up,
^r stceratioal d sime ions Tie was opposed to hotbed monop-
olies because they nourished socal t isuncuons which were in-
compatible with the republican institutions of the country
(sufficient manifestations had been shown, during the progress
of this measuie, to satisfy every true patriot that it was time to
assert the independence of legislation against the dictation of
monopolist manufacturers Great complaint had been made of
ExecuUve dictation, but the Executive had not gone beyond
