HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE:

SIR: I have the honor to call the attention of the major-general commanding the corps to the following facts in relation to the Fourth Division, which it is proposed to disband or incorporate with some others. That division, with the exception of three small battalion, was a portion of the old First Corps (First Division). At the commencement of the campaign they, with the brigade transferred to General Griffin in the early part of June, composed the division; that brigade was also a part of the First Corps. It was provided in the order of reorganization that the First Corps should be organized into two divisions and retain their badges and to a certain extent their identity.
