General GRIMES:

This dispatch has just been received. You can move back to your camp, but keep your commanding ready; have your wagons so that they can be moved at any time.

Yours, &amp;c.,

J. B. GORDON,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., March 13, 1865.

General ROBERT E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

The Secretary of War has just informed me that General Johnston has directed the removal of supplies from Raleigh as necessary to their safety. If this indicates a purpose to retire behind the railroad line from Goldsborough to Raleigh, and thence to Greensborough, the region of supplies will be lost and we cannot maintain our position in Virginia and North Carolina. I hope you will be able by specific instructions to avert so great a calamity.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., March 13, 1865.

General ROBERT E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your favor in regard to the bill for putting negroes in the army. The bill was received from the Congress to-day and was immediately signed. I shall be pleased to receive such suggestions from you as will aid me in carrying out the law, and I trust you will endeavor in every available mode to give promptitude to the requisite action.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFF'N DAVIS.
HEADQUARTERS,March 13, 1865-12.45 a. m.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War:

Lonstreet will start early in the morning with Pickett's division and some artillery to intercept the enemy and prevent his destruction of property, as far as practicable. Fitz Lee has been notified of enemy's movements and directed to co-operate with Longstreet and lend such assistance as may be in his power to render. I fear, however, he may not be up in time. I will submit your telegram to General Lee in the morning, when he will respond to the latter portion of it.

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
