ficit, to be piovidet! for in this and

This esiim te is founded on the as-
sumption that all moneys in the
public depositor es can be at orce
made available, and that anv and
all of the demands upon the Trea-
sury can be satisfied, so long as
monev to a sufficient amount re-
miins in any or a'l the deposito-
ries But that is by no means the
cas , while the power to issue Trea-
sury tinted exists, thtra should be
at itll time?, for the einvemence
of the Treasury, a sum equal to
$1,000,000 in the various deposi-
tories sjbjfet to diaft When that
power is expended the sum should
be increased to not less than        - 4 000,000 00
Which sorr, aided to the above,
makes h esi'maed deficit         #16 088 215 18
But the unders gned feels it his duty to call the
attention of Congress to the mote immediate de-
mands of the public s-er/ice, ard the means by
which those demands are to be supplied
The sums which will be required from the 1st of
June to the 31st of August next are estimated as
follows, viz
Foi the payment ot Treasury notes
which will fall due within that
time,  and   the   interest th.reon,

The ways and means m the power
of the Treasury, and which will pro-
bably accrue under existing laws, are
as follows:

And leaving a deficit of                       5,251,388 30
To which add the sum recommended
to be kept m the Treasury to meet
any emeigencies of the public ser-
vice, viz  -           -           -           - 4,000,000 00
Making an. aggregate of              9,251,388 30
In another part of this paper the views of the
Department as to the mode of providing for the
above deficit, together with the residue of the ex-
isting public debt, will be presented.
From the year 1816 to 1837, a period
of twenty-one years, t^e revenues
Constantly  exceeded the expendi-
tures    The average annual sur-
plus during that tun  was #11,-
464 226 87, (see tables 1 ?nd 2,)
making   an   aggregate   excess  of
#240,748 764  27     Of  this   there
was applied to the extinction of the
national   debt   #208 792 127   44,
and ihere was   under the provi-
sions of the act of the 23d of June,
1836,   deposited wi'n the States
$28 101 644 91, and there re-
mained  on  the   1st  of  January,
1837, m the Treasury of the Un -
ted States, including the foorth in-
stalment due to the States, a sur-
plus of    -           -           -           -17,109,473 26
There were, also, outstanding debts.
due and falling due to the Treasu-
ry, arising from other souices than
those of the ordinary revenue, and
wlvch were paid between the first
of January,   1837,   and   4 h   of
March,  1841, the amount of (see
statement D)       -           -           --9,124,747 00
There were, also, issued within that
period, and outstanding on the 4th
of March,  1841, Treasury notes
to the amount of -           -           - 5,648,512 40
Making    the   aggregate   available
means 'fthieh w re- m the Trea-
sury on the 1st of January, 1837,
and which came into it prior to the
4th of  March,  1841,  over   and
above the current revenue             31,882,732 66
From which deduct the amount (less
the trust funds) remaining in  the
Treasury  on  the  4th of March,

penditure over the current revenue
of
