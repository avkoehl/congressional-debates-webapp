General S. COOPER:

Ten transports, laden with white troops from Morganza, passed Fort Adams, Wilkinson County, last evening, coming up. Expedition from Vicksburg freely spoken of to start as soon as re-enforcements from below arrive. Troops already reported to have arrived form below, said to be from Donaldsonville.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

MERIDIAN, June 23, 1864. (Received 26th.)

General S. COOPER:

A raid in force is threatened from Vicksburg. My scouts report 2,000 re-enlisted troops as having arrived at Vicksburg from above and five white regiments and 2,000 negroes from below. The arrival of troops at Vicksburg and Memphis can only be accounted for by the arrival of the ninety days' men. Should these be intended to operate in Mississippi, my present force is inadequate. The best arrangements are being made to meet the force from Memphis and Vicksburg.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF ALA., MISS., AND EAST LA., Meridian, Miss., June 23, 1864.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose a communication to you from Major-General Buckner, as he was crossing the MISSISSIPPI River. Lieutenant Ruggles, with a signal detachment, was ordered to Colonel Scott a short time since. We are deficient in rifle guns in this department; am expecting six or eighth which have been promised for the last four months. Should these guns arrive Colonel Scott can then be supplied. The suggestions of General Buckner are good and will be perfected.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
