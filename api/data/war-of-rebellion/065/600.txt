CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864-11 a.m.

Brigadier General JOSEPH FINEGAN,

Commanding East Florida, Lake City, Fla.:

Do not fight when expecting re-enforcements unless compelled or certain of success. In such case maneuver to delay enemy. You can expect no more re-enforcements at present from Georgia than those already announced you.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864-12 m.

Major General J. F. Gilmer,

Savannah, Ga.:

Let troops of Colquitt's brigade which have reached you and Harrison's regiment be sent on at once by shortest route to aid Finegan, with five days' subsistence and 100 rounds of ammunition.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864-12.30 p.m.

His Excellency JOHN MILTON,

Governor of Florida, Tallahassee, Fla.:

Recent developments induce me to add to force already sent to General Finegan, and all shall be done possible in the exigency.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major General J. F. Gilmer,

Savannah, Ga.:

Enemy's present movements indicate efforts to concentrate from both sides of peninsula of Florida at Tallahassee; therefore, concentration and movement on our side from Trader's Hill. I do not approve pressing to concentrate at point in rear of Finegan to prevent junction and maneuvers to strike blow on either fragment.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major General J. F. Gilmer,

Savannah, Ga.:

Send Wheaton's battery of Florida with suitable ammunition for field service. Quartermaster and commissary must have supplies collected at suitable points in advance to secure celerity of their movements. Answer.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
