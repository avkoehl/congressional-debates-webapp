THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 14,
ing a measure applicable only to the State of
Louisiana, and in the shape in which that bill
wag passed by the House it applies only to the
State of Louisiana. 1 agree with the Senator
from Illinois that that bill is defective in one
or two particulars, but I will not discuss that
question. At any rate it is narrow in its appli-
cation, and it is a matter of serious doubt
whether if passed it should go beyond the
State of Louisiana. It was not so intended
■when it was proposed; it was not so decided
by the House, but was rather regarded as in
the nature of an experiment than otherwise.
If we adopt it in that shape, it is but a local
measure, having a comparatively narrow appli-
cation. On the contrary, this bill proposed by
the Committee on Reconstruction applies to
all the States which were in rebellion, and I
believe it is as reasonable and perfect as any
bill of the kind can be made. I think, how-
ever, that, the amendment proposed by one of
my colleagues in the House, and which was
voted for by a majority of our friends there,
when it comes to be read and considered by
Senators will commend itself to their minds.
I think that is as complete and makes as com-
plete a system, when taken in connection with
the bill, as could possibly be offered now.
At this late period of the session the ques-
tion arises which of these bills is it best to
take lip first? It makes no difference which
was first_ presented here. The question is,
which is it advisable for us to consider first,
the one which lias the general application to
all these States or the one that, haa merely a
local application. I have no doubt upon that
subject, and therefore I suggested to my friend
from Ohio, and he seems in what he has stated
to have come to the same conclusion, that the
serious important, question was to pass one,
and he has intimated that lie would not antag-
onize the Louisiana bill with the bill reported
from the Committee 011 Reconstruction. I am
in favor of both bills, but 1 should be very glad
to see an amendment made to each. I have
no doubt but that if we amend cither of the
bills, when it goes back to the House it can be
passed there instanter, because the majority in
that body have the power, if they choose to
excrcise it, to pass a lull of this description at
once, and I have 110 doubt it can be passed.
At any rate what opposition will bo made to
the one would be made to the other. It is im-
portant .that, the bill of the honorable Senator
from Oregon should have its second reading
to-day, in order to save one day of time at least,
and I hope it will be taken up for that pur-
pose.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I did not anticipate any
objection to tho second reading of this bill;
and if there bo any question of precedence
between the two bills, it appears to ine that,
according to nil usage, the bill to which I have
called attention should be first considered.
Mr. WADE. Will the Senator give way to
me for a moment?
Mr. WILLIAMS. Certainly.
Mr. WADE. I find there is doubt in the
minds of our friends about the priority of these
bills. I have 110 anxiety on that point. My
only desire is to have one of them considered
and proceeded with. To accommodate all I
will move now that the bill which was taken up
on my motion be postponed until to-morrow.
Mr. SHERMAN. It will be postponed until
to-morrow by the other motion.
_ The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the motion of the Senator from Ohio,
[Mr. Sherman.]
Mr. SHERM AN. I withdraw that motion
to enable the Senator from Oregon to get a
formal second reading of his bill. I suppose
it will be done without debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion
of the Senator from Ohio is withdrawn.
GOVERNMENT OF SOUTHERN STATES.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Then I move that the
Senate now proceed to the consideration of
House bill No. 1143.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (H.
R. No. 1143) to provide for the more efficient
government of the insurrectionary States was
read the second time by its title.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I now move to offer an
amendment which I propose to offer to the
bill, which I ask to have printed, that it may
be laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No objec-
tion being made, the order to print will be en-
tered.
ORDER Or BUSINESS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I now move to take up
Senate bill No. 594.
Mr. CHANDLER. I hope that motion will
not prevail. I have been trying for several
weeks to get up House bill No. 344, to incor-
porate tho Niagara Ship-Canal Company. I
gave notice that I should antagonize it against
any bills except appropriation bills, and I wish
to have it taken up now.
Mr. SHERMAN. This bill is from the
Committee on Finance, and ought to be actcd
on promptly. I do not think it will excite
discussion; hut if it does it ought to be passed
at any rate.
Mr. CHANDLER. I shall ask for a vote
on taking up House bill No. 344. I therefore
move to lay on the table the motion of the Sen-
ator from Ohio, for the purpose of taking up
that bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is not in order to lay
mv motion 011 the table; it must be put.
'The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is 011 tho motion of the Senator from Ohio
to postpone tho bill now before the Senate and
take up tho bill mentioned by him.
Mr. CHANDLER. I hope the Senate will
not do it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Before we act upon that
motion I should like to understand whether tho
two bills which have had their second reading
have been printed as they passed the House.
I should like to know, because I perceive that
some gentlemen have raised that objection.
If they aro not, they ought to be.
Tho PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
is informed that both bills have been printed
since they came to the Senate as passed by the
IIousc. The question is now on the motion
of the Senator from Ohio.
C 0 .M PO UN D-IN TE It EST NOTES.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S.
No. 604) to provide for the payment of com-
pound-interest notes was read the second time,
and considered us in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes to authorize the Secretary of
the Treasury, for the purpose of redeeming
and retiring any compound-interest notes out-
standing, to issue temporary loan certificates
in the manner prescribed by section four of
the act entitled "An act to authorize the issue
of United States notes and for the redemption
or funding thereof, and for funding the float-
ing debt of tho United States," approved
February 25, 1802, bearing interest at a rate
not exceeding three per cent, per annum,
principal and interest payable in lawful money
on demand. These certificates of temporary
loan may constitute and be held by any national
bank holding or owning them, as a part of the
reserve provided for in sections thirty-one and
thirty-two of the act entitled "An act to pro-
vide a national currency secured by a pledge
of United States bonds, and to provide for the
circulation and redemption thereof," approved
June 3, 1S64 ; but not less than two lii'ths of
the entire reserve of such bank shall consist
of lawful money of the United States, and the
amount of such temporary certificates at any
time outstanding is not to exceed $80,000,000.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the
Committee on Finance to move to amend the
billinlinetwenty-fourbystrikingout " eighty"
and inserting "one hundred," so as to make it
read, "that tho amount of such temporary cer-
tificates at amy time outstanding shall not ex-
ceed $100,000,000."
Mr. TRUMBULL. I did not know that
this bill was to come np to-day, and did not
anticipate its being called up at this hour. I
wanted to propose an amendment, which I
have not now prepared, that instead of issuing
other indebtedness for these compound-interest
notes as they fall due, provision should be made
to take them up by paying for them out of the
Treasury of the United States. I do notbelieve
we should continue to keep in the Treasury one
hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty
million dollars, and that is what we have
been doing. * We had that question up the
other day, and now here is a bill continuing
that state of things. When the question was
under consideration some days ago we were
told by Senators of the Finance Committee
that there was no way of relieving the Treas-
ury of this large amount of money which had
been kept in its vaults because our indebted-
ness was not due. Now, some indebtedness is
about to fall due, and provision is being made
by the bill to issue other indebtedness in place
of it, instead of paying it off as it becomes due.
I did hope the Finance Committee would have
devised some way by which the amount in the
Treasury should be reduced; but it seems they
arc not disposed to do so, but introduce a bill
to issue $80,000,000 of indebtedness in lieu of
that which is to come in ; and now they propose
in the Senate to increase it to §100,000,000. I
am not prepared at this time to propose an
amendment. I was not aware that this subject
would come up to-day. I hope the bill may go
over and not be acted upon at this time.
Mr. SHERMAN. The purpose of this bill
is to provide in part for the payment of the
compound-interest notes. I have an official
statement of them, from which it appears that
the total amount of principal is $143,004,040,
and of tho interest on maturity is $27,701,921
—in all $170,826,501. Tho statement is as
follows:

It thus appears that prior to January next
provision must be made for 8119,000,000 for
these notes. Several modes have been sug-
gested : first, by the application of the gold and
currency on hand; second, by accruing receipts
from the revenue; third, by the sale of bonds;
fourth, by issuing more legal tenders or stop-
ping the payment of the $4,000,000 a month of
legal tenders now authorised by law; or fifth,
by a temporary arrangement with the national
banks, such as is proposed by this bill. A few
remarks on each of these will explain the action
of the Committee on Finance.
I have before me an official statement of the
currency and gold on hand on the 8th of Feb-
ruary. It as follows:
