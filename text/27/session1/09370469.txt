State in the Union These exemptions do not impair the ob-
ligation 01 contracts, which the States cannotdo under the Con-
stitution They only go to the remedy, which is within the
coniiol of tlie ¡state Legislatures They can, therefore, not

this bill become a law, and I will vcntuie to predict that, altei
it has been proved and improved by years ol expeuence, we
shall look back with perfect astonishment to tins enl glneaed

oí b nbarism, the bondage of the debtor, could have so long
existed and beentoleiated in a country claiming pre eminence
01 er all others for the liberality ami freedom of its institutions
SPEECH OF MR  FESSENDEN,
OF MAINE,
In Hi" House of Representatives, Atiqust 11, l&ll — On the
bill to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy thioughout
the United States.
The House being in Committee of the Whole on the state ot
the Union, and a motion having been made to strike out the en-
acting clause of the bill—
Mr I DSSüNDEN said Mi Cliauman, the bill now under
consideiation 11 one in which many of my constituents ftel <t
veiydeep interest, more, perhaps, than in any other measine
which has come befoie us rlujmg the pie«ent session This
fact 1 piesiime would of it&eTl be suthcient to excuse 11 e if

Mr I 1 unís] ui on tlie coi siltuiltinality of the measuie, and I
11 pethai my aiguinent, it I may dignify inj íeinaiks will the
name of argument, may rendet the ijuestion as clem to the
minds of other gentlemen us it stems now to my own
I came heie, Mi Chauman, with my 11 ml made up w.th ro
cud to this measure I believed that not only the power of
Cou i ess, but its duty, to pass a general bankrupt law, was un
questionable It is a power, sir, whirii ought nut, in my jtulg-
meit to have lam dormant so lonp -situated asthib countiy is,
ol a highly tomnienlal rhiractcr, andrequning that the laws
of crtditoi and debtor should be uniform andcltaily aefined,
there should have been no considei able period amce oui Consti
tu 101 w is foi med in which this power of the General G >vet n
ment was not in ac ive and efficient operation
A^ain sir, I believe tint tin peculiar cucumstances of this

II sn wi can by legislation lessen these evils, if we can lift
the burden pressi g so heavily upon the community, it is om
