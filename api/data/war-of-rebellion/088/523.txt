HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPARTMENT,August 26, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following dispatch should have been received some time since, but just came from plank road station:

At 4.40 p. m. a squadron of cavalry and brigade of infantry came from the left on line of the Weldon railroad and disappeared near lead-works, moving toward Petersburg. Immediately after another column of infantry and one of cavalry appeared coming from the left on line of Weldon railroad, and took the roads running westward parallel with each other from southeast corner of large fort. The infantry occupied thirteen minutes in passing, and the cavalry eleven minutes. The presence of a large force in the vicinity of the fort is supposed from seeing many men in scattered parties through the day, lounging about.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.

At 5.30 a column of infantry, about a mile in length, came from our left on line of Weldon railroad and disappeared near lead-works, moving in direction of Petersburg.
