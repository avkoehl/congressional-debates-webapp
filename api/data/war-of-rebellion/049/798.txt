I have telegraphed Herbert to send flag. The refugees are mostly women and children.

Just received from General Barton:

Scouts from within enemy's lines report that Foster's expedition has gone to Mobile.

From Colonel Griffin:

Enemy carried off from Perquimans and Chowan Counties during the late raid between 400 and 500 negroes, mostly women and children. They have returned to New Berne. All quiet to-day.

GEO. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS PICKETT'S DIVISION,October 21, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Adjt. and Insp. General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose return of division for the month of September.* Numbers of applications for the return of detailed men on work in Navy Department, &amp;c., have been sent back disapproved. I have received every encouragement in believing that many of, if not all, these men should be sent back. The division has not increased as rapidly as it would have done had the exchanges been accomplished and detailed men returned to their regiments.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. PICKETT,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsements.]

OCTOBER 23, 1863.

Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War.

By last return, September 30, the Strength of this division is as follows:

Effective total............................................ 4,764

Total present.............................................. 5,610

Aggregate present.......................................... 6,022

Present and absent, total..................................11,192

Present and absent, aggregate..............................11,989

When filled according to organization, the strength of the division should be about 24,000 - more than twice its present strength. I recommend that all detailed men now absent from the command be returned to it.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

OCTOBER 24, 1863.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

I am endeavoring to return detailed men as far as the interests of the general service will possibly allow.

J. A. S. [SEDDON,]

Secretary.
