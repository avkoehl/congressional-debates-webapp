These officers (paper Q*) were selected by you with great care and accurate discrimination and appointed or assigned to enrolling service. With few exceptions, all other officers in that service were assigned by accident or by reason of unfituties; and from this cause, when I came to the Bureau, I found the service confused and languid, and the administration of the conscript laws necessarily unsatisfactory. Chiefly by the zealous and intelligent aid of these seventy officers thus selected, the system was organized and the administration became fruitful, not only in men for the field, but in managing the external police of the armies, and also in furnishing a large amount of information on which to base the military policy of the country. These officers were the chief who controlled, informed, and energized the ungenial agencies filtered into the conscript from the debris of the general service. They were the practiced and trained soldiers and judges on whom I relied to sustain me in my hard duty of wringing from the wasted population the scanty remnant of men, and at the same time to preserve, as far as our military need would permit, the enfeebled productive energies of the country. These officers have been discharged by the operation of a law which does not provide adequate compensation to the public service.

In the States of Virginia, north Carolina, and South Carolina these officers were the principal agents of conscription, and in these States conscription has been eminently successful. In Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida the officers were altogether casual, and from these States came all the complaints of the evils and failures of conscription.

The Invalid-Corps bill has furnished no substitutes for these officers, and I have no authority to ask or receive officers from any other source except such as may be sent by the casualties of the field, or on declarations of incompetence. I cannot too strongly express my dismay at the almost certain prospect of the utter failure of the conscription service during the coming vital campaign if it is made dependent on the accidental officers who are fitfully and irregularly assigned to its duties. On the 1st day of April no branch of the public service was working with more order and efficiency than that under the control of this Bureau. All obstacles and impediments- and they were of the gravest character- were yielding to the intelligence, the indomitable zeal and devotion of the officers. On the 1st day of May over a large portion of the Confederacy the service will be paralyzed. Leaving out the plea of harsh and cruel dealing with these officers, a large majority of whom are disabled by wounds and disease, and have resigned higher to take inferior commissions, I regard this statement I have made as sufficient warrant for me to suggest a recommendation that Congress make some provision for reinstating these officers in the enrolling service with their proper commissions.

VI. Another grave interruption has come of the occasional, but too frequent, assignment of officers commanding in the field to the duty of conscription and recruiting in particular localities. In every instance this has unduly disturbed the production of the country-has violated legal rights-has failed to send men into the field-and has been unjust to the general service. In no instance has an officer commanding in the field, charged with local conscription, sent a conscript out of his department. The assumption by local authorities to determine liability to service has uniformly been detrimental, keep-
