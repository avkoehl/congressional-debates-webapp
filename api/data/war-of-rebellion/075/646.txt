Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch is received. General Hascall will be at his headquarters at the time you indicate this morning, ready to make the contemplated change. General Cox has on brigade on this side of Olley's Cree, in rear of Hascall's right, picketing across the valley to Colonel Byrd's position, where we were yesterday. If practicable, I would like to have that brigade relieved also. I think one of General Hooker's divisions can do it all.
