Honorable ANDREW JOHNSON,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Several members of the Cabinet, with myself, considered the question to day as to the time of your coming on here. While we fully appreciate your wish to remain in Tennessee until her State government shall be completely reinaugurated, it is our unanimous conclusion that it is unsafe for you not to be here on the 4th of March. Be sure to reach here by that time.

A. LINCOLN.
