troops at that point, and not, in the general's opinion, as favorably posted as might be. We have good reason to suppose that the enemy is moving to our right. Please advance your pickets for purpose of observation as far as may be safe, in order to obtain timely information of their approach.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.

FALMOUTH, May 2, 1863-5 p.m.

General SEDGWICK:

Just received from General Hooker, dated 1.55 a.m., May 2, Chancellorsville:

Direct all bridges to be taken up at Franklin's crossing and below before daylight, and for Reynolds' corps to march at once, with pack train, to report to headquarters.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

MAY 2, 1863-6 a.m.

General SEDGWICK:

There is no visible change since last evening, only the withdrawal of the battery on the hill which Colonel Tompkins differed with you as to the kind. I think they are only drawn under cover. I see one caisson in the ravine to the rear of their last night's position. No change as to numbers in the rifle-pits nor in range of our vision.

JAS. S. HALL,

Captain and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 2, 1863-7.30 a.m.

General SEDGWICK:

The following has just been received, addressed to General Butterfield:

I have just obtained a tolerable good view of all the main roads beyond the heights, and toward Chancellorsville, but could see no troops or wagon trains on them. The enemy opposite remain in the same position, apparently, without any increase.

Very respectfully,T. S. C. LOWE.

JAS. S. HALL.

SIGNAL STATION, May 2, 1863-8.40 a.m.

General SEDGWICK:

There is much less display of force in front of General Brooks this morning. Flags which were there yesterday have disappeared, but the position enables them to conceal troops by sitting or lying down.

KENDAL AND BABCOCK,

Signal Officers.
