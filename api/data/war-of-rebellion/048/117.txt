On reaching the open country I established a line of skirmishers in advance of the wood, with supports, leaving the First Massachusetts in reserve. Having advanced my skirmishers as far as I might without exposing my supports, I reported the result of my observations and requested orders. Being ordered to press forward and compel the enemy to develop whatever he might have on the opposite side, I threw forward dismounted skirmishers, engaging them with the enemy at 500 yards distance, and about 800 yards from the river, under the support of mounted skirmishers, and squadrons in line of battle within long supporting distance. A severe shell fire from seven pieces concentrically placed on both sides of the river was developed, and sharp skirmishing ensued.

A cavalry force, apparently of two squadrons, appeared on this side in front, with two guns appearing and disappearing near them, and commanding the road with the enemy evidently expected me to sue. Two full batteries, not opened on the right and left, but harnessed up, a large number of men on foot (said by my officers to be infantry), a large wagon train stationary, one cavalry camp (from which men had been seen moving, leaving horses saddled), and rifle-pits, with a dense smoke behind the hills on the other side, were distinctly seen; movements of the enemy indicated a large force ready to repel and inviting attack, but apparently moving away from river.

During the last hour before sunset two cavalry charges were made upon our skirmishers, and handsomely repelled by short charges up to the edges of deep water-courses which separated the parties and made pursuit dangerous. The position was difficult for cavalry, involving either the abandonment of skirmishers, the exposure of supporting squadrons, or the failure of the reconnaissance. Every change of position at once changed the range of the enemy's artillery, and by retiring at a gallop a portion of our cavalry in the woods, and instantly debouching to another position, a dangerous shell fire was diverted from the deployed squadrons to the empty woods, with marked relief.

About nightfall I was withdrawing my line toward the woods. The First Maryland was ordered to relieve the Sixth Ohio, and while the change was making a sharp shell fire opened, and the enemy charged, driving in the skirmishers. The charge was repelled by the First Maryland and the prompt appearance of the squadron of the First Rhode Island and the First Massachusetts at various points, and a line of pickets was strongly established, and held firmly until I was relieved this morning. The casualties are reported as follows:* Killed, 3; wounded, 22; missing, 4. I think the casualties in the First Maryland Cavalry were occasioned in a large degree by charging beyond the skirmish line over bad ground and not hearing recall of bugle. The charge was very gallantly entered on, and opportune. We took 3 prisoners; several rebels wounded are reported. I have the honor to inclose the reports of the officers commanding, and to mention with great praise the perfect gallantry and steadiness of the command under a destructive fire, constantly increasing in severity as the skirmish line was advanced.

Lieutenant-Colonel Stedman, Captain Northway, and Lieutenant Austin, of the Sixth Ohio, handled their skirmish line with great coolness and efficiency.
