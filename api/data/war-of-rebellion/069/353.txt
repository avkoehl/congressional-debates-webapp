HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General CUTLER:

Do not press your men forward after finding the enemy's skirmishers unless the connection on your right and left is made. I do not care to crowd them much to-day, but hold on to all we get. I shall send an officer to reconnoiter the picket-line by and by.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 10.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

After joining my advanced force on what is called the main road to Richmond, I halted and sent out on that road and found it crossed the railroad at Peake's Turnout, about a mile from where I intersected it, the road running nearly west. About one-half a mile short of the railroad is another road running to Mechanicsville, which I have had followed about 3 miles, where the party ran into the skirmishers of Hill's corps, who is represented to be intrenched about half a mile farther back and crossing the road last referred to. I have not yet been able to get hold of the right of the Second Corps, and believe I am in advance of it, but hope to know shortly. I am issuing rations as fast as they can be got up to the troops, who are generally quite out. There ought to be some cavalry force to watch the river road from Mr. Hundley's to Hanover Court-House to cover our right and rear, the few cavalry on these roads having been taken by me to aid in the reconnaissances I have been making.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The major-general commanding has misunderstood my dispatch if he supposes I halted a single moment to issue rations. I halted to find by whereabouts, and used all possible diligence in so doing. Rations were all issued before I was ready to start. My column is now on the road moving with all practicable dispatch to connect with Hancock's right. I am mortified to learn from your note* that the major-general commanding should suppose that anything short of impossibility should delay me in taking position.

Major-General, Commanding.
