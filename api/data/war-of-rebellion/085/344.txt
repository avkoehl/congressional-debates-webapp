Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

My scouts sent out ont he 16th have just come in. They did not get into Arkansas, or indeed accomplish much worthy of note. They report that Shelby was in Lawrence County, Ark., on the 19th instant, but do not locate Price. They report that Price is to bring arms for Coleman's and Freedman's bands. Coleman is to come in between Salem and Potosi in the direction of Steelville. Freeman is to attack Salem; he has about 500 men. These parties were also to operate against the railroad from Rolla to Saint Louis, Mo.
