Major General FRANK. GARDNER,Commanding, &amp;c., Jackson, Miss.:

GENERAL: General Smith directs me to inclose herewith copies of communications with reference to the enemy's movements and to say that he thinks the concentration of the enemy indicates a movement against Mobile and Texas coast. He thinks, however, that it will be against Mobile.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

We have transportation for 2,000 men per day here. So far the arrivals average only 400 men. Cannot the number be increased? If they arrive at Meridian would it not be well to send part via Mobile? Officer at Selma complains of conduct of officers and men there and asks that a general officer be sent there to control them.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., January 27, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

Orders assigning staff of General Hood to other commands designed only temporary. It is not intended to interfere with their permanent assignment under Special Orders, Numbers 302, Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, paragraph 27, 1863. They will be regarded as still on the staff of the Army of Tennessee.
