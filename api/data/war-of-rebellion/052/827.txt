HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 24, 1863-4.45 p.m.

Brigadier General W. C. WHITAKER:

Your report of the recapture of the ferry-boat is received. The general commanding directs you to take a sufficient force down to protect the crossing at all hazards. I do not understand from your letter whether you wish spades sent to you, or whether you can procure them on your side of the river. If you cannot get them there, send a detail here to carry them, and they can be borrowed from some other command. The rifle-pits should be constructed at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., FIRST DIV., RESERVE CORPS, Near Chattanooga, September 24, 1863.

[Captain S. B. MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:]

SIR: I have the honor to report that a body of rebels, clothed in Federal uniforms, approached the river this morning at the crossing near the base of Lookout Mountain, and succeeded in capturing the boat which was being moved to a better position by a squad of 34 men, but the regiment which I had stationed on this side at that point opened fire upon the rebels, and made it so hot as to compel them to leave the boat, which I now have in my possession.
