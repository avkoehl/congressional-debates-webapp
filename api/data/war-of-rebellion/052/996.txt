Brigadier-General WOOD,

Commanding First Division:

SIR: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of this 2 p.m., and to state that you did right in pursuing your line of march. The information you sent had been received here early this morning, and was imparted to the general commanding the department.

Respectfully, yours,

SEPTEMBER 10, 1863.

Captain P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: As the order to march was not received till near 6 o'clock, and some preparations in the way of rations has to be made, it will be impossible to march, but it will be done as soon thereafter as practicable. Don't reply. I will be on Palmer's and Van Cleve's heels very soon. I presume the remainder of the train will stay here.

Do we get our supplies from Bridgeport? I wish to send back a train, so let me know.

Respectfully,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,September 10, 1863-2 p.m. (Received 3.30 p.m.)

Captain P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have just learned that there is some force of the enemy at Gordon's Mills, on the Chattanooga and La Fayette road, with wagons, beef cattle, &amp;c., probably the rear of the corps that retreated by that road. It is 8 miles across the country to my right, and too far for me to pay attention to what is there, even if my orders permitted me to leave my present line of march. Would it not be well to push some force from Chattanooga to look after the matter?

Respectfully, &c.,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
