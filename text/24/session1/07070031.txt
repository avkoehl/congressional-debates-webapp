I havp s-ud, Mr President, that I would do
this undtr anv circumstance s—so I would But
alter the message of the President upon the sub-
ject of our relations with France, which was
communicated to this Senate very recently, (Mon-
div,) I should consider further delay as fraught
w ith imminent danger I heard that communi-
cation with every feeling of pride and of pa-
triotism It was well worthy of its author, and
of the occasion, and I was surprised to hear
that any Senator could have heard it with " pro-
tound regret "
In pursuance, then, of the recommendation
contained in that message, I would promptly put
our w hole country in a state of defense—the exi-
gency of the times demands it—our relations
w ith Prance demand it—a proper respect to
ourselves demands it. I was utteily astonished
to hear it asserted on this floor, that, under
exis'ing circumstances, to arm would be equiva-
lent to a declaration of war. Can it be, that, to
prepare for the controversy, if controversy must
come between us and our ancient ally, to put our
beloved country in a state of safety, to arm our
fortifications, to equip our public ships, would
be regarded by her as the commencement of hos-
tilities on our part'
Such may be the sentiments of some of the
members of this Senate. They are not the sen-
timents of my mind, and I cannot yield my
assent to them.
Whether w ar or peace is to be the fate of this
land, my voice is be ready—be prepared—be well
prepared for any and for every possible exigency.
What' shall we, the freest nation on the globe,
unembarrassed with debt—rich in resources—
powerful in means—shall we, for fear of giving
offense to his Majesty, fold our arms, and sub-
mit to every exaction which he may see fit to
impose' Shall we hesitate to prepare to assert
our rights—to maintain our honor' Shall we
stand still, let patience have her perfect work,
and whenever it shall be the gracious pleasure of
His Most Christian Majesty " Louis Philippe"
to pay us the debt Prance so justly owes us, to
receive it with a submissive thankfulness, to
bring it home, and to distribute it among the
claimants' God save us from such a scene of
humiliation ' I say, then, Mr President, let us,
regardless of consequences, fearlessly do our
duty, and all will be well                                          j
My mam purpose in addressing the Senate at I
this time, was to answer some remarks which i
fell from the Senator from Massachusetts, in re- j
lation to the proceeding of the two Houses of
Congress at the last session upon the appropna- !
Hon bills.  In the commencement of his remarks,
the Senator passed a high encomium, well mer-
ited, I presume, upon the industry and punctu-
ality of the Senate at the last session; and I
cannot suppose that the gentleman intended, in
doing this, to make any insinuations or cast any ¡
reproach upon the industry and punctuality of
the last House of Representatives, if he does, he |
certainly does that House great injustice.   I was
a member of that House, and by its Presiding
Officer was placed on the Committee of Ways
and Means, as well as upon the committee of
conference which has attracted so much notice,
and  called   forth  so  much  seventy of remark
during the present discussion, and all I have to
say in defense of the industry and punctuality
of that body is, that the Journals will show the
mass of public and of private business which
was originated in that body during the last ses-
sion—the disposition which was made of it—the
number of bills which passed that body, and
were sent to the Senate, in addition to their pro-
ceedings upon the bills which came from the Sen-
ate     A reference to the Journals of the House
will satisfy the public mind on this point.   I will
only add, that for habits of industry, for punctu-
ality and promptness, sure I am that it cannot
suffer when put in comparison with the Senate
Itself
The Senator proceeds, and notices what he
regards as a somewhat unparliamentary proceed-
ing, an unusual course, at least, on the part of the
House, in failing to give the Senate any informa-
tion in reference to certain bills which had origin-
ated in the Senate, and which had passed that
body, and been sent to the House for their con-
currence. It so happened that I remained in
this city nearly a Week alter the last session of
Congress, and I then felt a deep mortification in
reading from one of the newspapers of this city
the following editorial article, under the date of
the 5th of March. It contains the same senti-
ments which the Senator fiom Massachusetts
has seen fit to present to the Senate in reference
to this matter.    I subjoin the extract
" Last Day oj the Session— Unfinished Business— West
Point academy -Loss of the Fortification Bill —The two
Hoiues of Congre * adjourned tile m^ht before list, their
functions then ceasing, and what a wreck of public busi
ness endued'
"In our two or three last papers we expressed our
opinion respecting the state °t the public business m the
House oí Representatives It would have brtcn as just,
hid our intimation re p^cted the stafc of the House
\V ith a great deal of talent, and, we Inve no doubt,
too a ¡rr'-at drta! of pitnoti in, the late House ot Repre-
sentatives had b°en brou^ut into a condition, by various
causes, in which it seemed ncipablo of getting on with the
busm" s ot tie coimtrv A teniiv- ob irvers had noticed
a tendenej of this kind, from the earlv part of the «es«ion ,
but its last clays forced the truth On the minds of all Long
debites, the endless p rplexitv of the rules, contests
ever) moment ibout priority ot business, and an eiger
ne>s of discus ion which seemed entirely to di regard the
compirative importance of subjects, were imong these
causes There were others, oi which we could speak—of
Wnich. indeed, we shall teel tt our duty to speak, and to
sp'ik treelv, hereafter—but which we at present forbear to
nr-ntion
"The melancholv result of the whole is, that Congress
has broken up, leaving almost every great measure ot the
session unfinished, and, therefore, totally null and void
The following bills, originating in the Senate, most of thtm
passing that body by large majorities, and some of them
quite unanimous!}, have shared the great wreck and rum
' The Post Office reform bill, (passed unanimously in
the Senate )
" The custom-houseregulations bill, (passed nearly unan-
imously m the Senate )
"The important judiciary but, (passed by a vote of thir-
ty one to five in the Senate )
" The bill regulating the deposit of the public moneys in
the deposit banÍKS
" The bill respecting the tenure of office and removals
from office, (a most important bill, supported in the Senate
by men of all parties )
" The bill indemnifying claimants far French spoliations
before 1800
" These half dozen (not to speak of the bill for the re-
lief of the cities of the District of Columbia, the bill pro
vidmg for the increase of the corps of engineers, the bill
to carry into effect the convention between the United
States and Spun, and the bill to improve the navigation
of the Mississippi m the vicinity of St Louis) are among
the bills which were sent from the Senate to the House of
Representauves,' and never heard of more '"
The fate of two of the appropriation bills,
however, originating, as such bills always do, m
the House of Representatives, is still more re-
markable.
Hitherto it has been usual te make the appro-
priations for the Military Academy at West Point
in the same bill which contains the general appro-
priations for the Army This year, an innovation
was indulged. The Army appropriation bill was
sent to the Senate with no appropriation whatever
for West Point. This circumstance was noticed,
at the time, in the Senate, and its attention called
to it as an extraordinary omission:
" A separate bill, however, containing the asnal appro
pnations for the Academy, was brought forward in the
House, but suffered to sleep Up to the last day for sending
bills from one House to the other, it had not passed The
House took no step whatever to pass the bill, by suspending
the operation of the rule as to sending bills from House to
House, or in any other way In this predicament, individ-
uals of the House brought the committee of die Senate to
interfere, and, in some extraordinary way, help to pass the
ordinary appropnation through Congress The Senate,
accordingly, attached the whole Military Academy appro-
priation bill to the bill making provision for the civil and
diplomatic expenditures of the year, and in this form it
passed into a law, and but for the adoption of this mode,
there could have been no appropriation at all, and the school
would have been broken up We may add, that when this
bill for covenng civil and diplomatic expenses went back to
the House, with amendments, the occasion was eagerly
seized to add to the Senate's amendment other amendments
respecting totally different matters—thus giving the bill a tad
as long as that of a comet
" Thus the bill pending in the House making provision
for the repairs of the Capitol and President's House, im-
proving the public grounds, paying the President's gardener,
&c , &c , was tacked on the bill, as being among the civil
and diplomatic expenses of the Government This bill,
however, (and we rejoice at it,) hid the goodness to pass
with all its length of tail, and (th inks to the Senate, and
no thanks to the House of Representatives) the West
Point Academy, therefore, was kept alive "
The gentleman expressed surprise that the
House should not have given to the Senate in-
formation about the bills enumerated in the pre-
ceding extract. The reason is that there had
been no final action of the House upon these
bills; they had been received from the Senate, it
is true, but such was the mass of public as well
as private business, upon its own Calendar, that
it was next to an impossibility for the House to
have acted upon these particular bills, they had
come to the House at too late a period of the
session for that branch to have definitively acted
upon them. Most, if not all of them, were not
reported to the House until after the 10th of Feb-
ruary, and the only bill of the number which was
ever taken up, and considered to any great ex-
tent, was the one in relation to the General Post
Office—certain the fact is that there was no final
action upon them, they were neither rejected, laid
upon the table, or indefinitely postponed, and
hence no information became necessary to be
communicated to the Senate in relation to them.
What possible benefit could result for the House
to inform the Senate, by message, that they had
received various bills, but had come to no decis-
ion upon them? Such a communication would
seem to me to be in itself, not only unparliament-
ary, but altogether unprofitable and unnecessary.
Certain the fact is, that such has not been the
usual practice of the two branches of the Govern-
ment. I therefore say, sir, that the House is not
obnoxious to any charge of neglect, to any omis-
sion of duty on this account.
The Senator from Massachusetts has rebuked
the House for its course of proceeding with ref-
erence to the general appropriation bill, and par-
ticularly with reference to its course upon the
bill making appropriations for the support of the
West Point Academy. The article which I have
just presented to the Senate, contains similar
charges against the House, for the same pre-
tended omissions of duty. How is this matter'
Is it true, that the last House of Representatives
stands properly charged for any omissions of
duty' What are the facts in relation to the ap-
propriation bill for the civil and diplomatic ex-
penses of the Government' It was a leading
object with the Committee of Ways and Means,
in repotting that bill, to introduce into it no ap-
propriation, except it had the warrant of some
existing law. It was distinctly remembered how
and for what reasons the general appropriation bill
of the first session of the last Congress was op-
posed It was kept in the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union for more than a month;
it was most violently attacked, and most reso-
lutely and perseveringly opposed. The Com-
mittee of Ways and Means of the last session
intended to prevent, if possible, the recurrence
of any such scene. The bill was reported,
speedily acted on in the House, and on the sec-
ond day of February, it was sent to the Senate
for their concurrence, and on the second day of
March, it passed the Senate with a little less than
half a hundred amendments. In this form that
bill for the support of the Government came
from the Senate to the House of Representatives.
Among the amendments agreed to by the Senate,
was a Senate bill, " confirming claims to lands in
the Sute of Missouri, and for other purposes;
a Senate bill " for completing: the road from Ian«
creek to the Chattahoochee, and for the erection
of bridges on the same;" a Senate bill "for
granting six hundred and fifty thousand acres of
land, m addition to former appropriations, for
the satisfaction of revolutionary bounty land
warrants;" together with various other amend-
ments of less importance, but containing entirely
new appropriations, as foreign from the title an
well as the intent and purport of the bill. When
,t passed the House, its title was, «An act
making appropriations for the civd and diplo-
matic expenses of the Government for the year
1835 " And after it had been amended in tne
wav and m the manner it was—after the Senate
had attached to it bills entirely incongruous,
originating ui their body-after incorporating in
