1859.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1379
gentlemen named i% a resolution and have the
Sergeant-at-Arms sent for them. It seems to me
that it is a contempt of the House for any one to
leave under these circumstances.
Mr. NICHOLS. I so regard it. It becomes
necessary, in order to transact the public busi-
ness, to act in this way. I want these men
brought back, as well as the absentees.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest
that there seems to be some imperfection in the
rules of the House with regard to this matter.
Under the rules, the Speaker has no authority to
order the doors to be closed till after the roll has
been called through the second time.
Mr. NICHOLS. I make the motion to sus-
pend the proceedings under this call, intimating
that I desire to move a new call, to catch the gen-
tlemen who have done this thing.
Mr. McQ,UEEN. I have staid here all the day
with as much anxiety as anyone to discharge our
public duties; but it is a perfect farce to be calling
the roll and doing nothing. I am unwilling that
gentlemen should leave their public business with
the object of forcing an extra session. I hope the
course indicated by the gentleman from Ohio will
.be carried out.
Mr. NICHOLS. I hope so, too.
Mr. SEWARD. I have been here all day, too,
and have tried to save the House all this trouble.
I move that the House do now [six o'clock and
eighteen minutes, p. m.] adjourn.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. JONES, of Pennsylvania. Is it in order
to move that the entire roll be now called over,
and have absentees sent for?
The SPEAKER. The result can only be ob-
tained m the way indicated by the gentleman from
Ohio.
Mr, NICHOLS. Then I move that all further
proceedings under this call be dispensed with.
The motion was agreed to; so all farther pro-
ceedings under the call were dispensed with, and
the Doorkeeper was ordered to open the doors.
Mr. NICHOLS. I now move that there be a
call of the House.
The motion was agreed to.
The roll was called, and the following members

cused .
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I hope no gentle-'
man will be excused for his absence in conse-

excused.
