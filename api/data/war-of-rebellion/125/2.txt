THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, January 1, 1864.

FRANKFORT, January 1, 1864.

Hon. E. M. STANTON:

The act raising 20,000 for Kentucky defense reserved to the President alone the power to remove them beyond Kentucky. You will remember the agreement that the regiments, then nearly filled, to the number of 7,500, were to be mounted, and with them and the State militia, I understood, to defend the State against guerrilla and other raids, and give up all other recruiting to fill the old regiments with three-years" men and such three- years" regiment as might be authorized. If these troops are taken from Kentucky we will be defenseless. If to be done I wish to know it, that I may prepare other means of defense and not rely on the act of Congress.

THOS. E. BRAMLETTE,

Governor of Kentucky.
