Lieutenant BURROUGHS:

General McCook directs that you make all necessary preparations as speedily as possible and throw the pontoon bridges across the river at early dawn this morning. Colonel Heg's brigade will cross first, as directed yesterday, and occupy the crest of the mountains beyond. If you have not the pioneers that should throw the bridge over already with the bridges, order them there as early as possible. Another brigade has been ordered to the ferry to protect the bridge. Throw the bridge across and in the manner indicated yesterday.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

General J. C. DAVIS:

Colonel Heg's brigade is all on the other side of the river and the bridge is being laid. We are anxious to have your Second Brigade here as soon as possible to support Colonel Heg, if necessary.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

STEVENSON, August 29, 1863-6.30.

General J. C. DAVIS:

The general commanding the corps directs that you move the First Brigade of your division at an early hour to-morrow morning to a position near the pontoon bridge at Caperton's Ferry. He wishes the brigade encamped on this side of the river until we have more definite information of the condition of affairs in the front. He also wishes you to have the main road running south from the bridge repaired, and put in order for the trains, &c., to pass over with all the expedition possible. Send up to the Pioneer Brigade and get five sledge hammers which are there, and which will be of much service in repairing the roads. It is very necessary that before crossing the river with your division you should have it supplied with axes, spades, and picks in accordance with the late order from department headquarters. The greater part of them can be carried in a wagon at division headquarters or in the ammunition wagon, to be distributed to the troops for special service.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
