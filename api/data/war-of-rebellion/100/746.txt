the use by the enemy of the Wilmington railroad. You are therefore desired to place yourself in position to strike that road and keep it in observation, preventing its use by the enemy for any practical purpose. By rapid movements, too, on isolated points, you ought to be able to destroy their detachments stationed along the road as gurds, and break up camps said to be formed for collecting supplies and negroes. But one report has been received since you were negroes.

But one report has been received since you were detached. They should be made more frequently and in detail.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

BRAXTON BRAGG.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

Enemy still reported west of Yadkin River. I have not sufficient force to guard well at same time this place, Salisbury, and Danville. Want of cavalry and slowness of transportation may prevent me from sending timely re-enforcements to Danville. Who is General Roberts, ordered yesterday, with General Martin, to report to me?
