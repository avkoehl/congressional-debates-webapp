dismounted, with such recklessness that some were drowned, drove back the two regiments posted on the bank and effected a lodgment on our side. At this juncture the two remaining battalions of the First Maine and the Thirteenth Ohio were ordered to dismount and deploy, the First Maine on the left of the road in the open field, the Thirteenth Ohio on the right of the road in the woods. As the line advanced the two regiments that had been driven back rallied, and the whole brigade charged, broke the enemy and drove him in confusion and with considerable loss across the stream. In this charge my leg was struck with a bullet, passing through my horse, proving death to the horse but safety to me. The gallant conduct of the First Maine Cavalry in this charge is deserving especial mention.

The entire brigade was then put in position along the bank of the creek dismounted, where it constructed a slight breast work with rails and such other material as was at its command. At 5.30 p.m. the enemy opened briskly with four pieces of artillery, and the brigade suddenly discovered that it was confronted by Pickett's division of infantry. The brigade maintained its ground under the hottest fire of which the enemy was capable, losing heavily all the while, till nearly dark, when it ran entirely out of ammunition, in consequence of the train being delayed by the bad roads, and was forced to fall back to the main road leading from Dinwiddie Court-House to Five Forks, where it reformed and intimidated the advance of the enemy by presenting a good front, without a cartridge. Had a less determined resistance been made on the bank of the creek, and the strong force of the enemy been allowed to gain possession of the main road above referred to, the result must have proved quite disastrous to our cause that day.

The following is a list of the casualties for the day: Captain Benjamin F. Metcalf, Thirteenth Ohio; Captain Eli Morse, Second New York Mounted Rifles; and Lieutenant James E. Stayner, First Maine Cavalry, killed. Major Paul Chadbourne, Captain H. C. Hall, Lieutenant L. M. Comins, and Lieutenant H. D. Fuller, First Maine Cavalry; Lieutenant C. W. Flagler and Lieutenant W. A. Crapser, Second New York Mounted Rifles; Captain B. F. Kling, Adjt. H. G. Brown, and Lieutenant J. W. Emmick, Thirteenth Ohio Cavalry; and Captain Shattuck, Sixth Ohio Cavalry, wounded; 18 enlisted men killed, 123 wounded. The First Maine alone lost in this engagement 88 killed and wounded.

The enemy was severely punished during the engagement. Colonel McNeil, Fifth North Carolina, was killed; Colonel Cheek,* First North Carolina, and Colonel Savage, of the Fifteenth Virginia, were wounded, besides many commissioned officers of lower grades. Many prisoners were captured, including 1 major and 2 captains.

In the evening the brigade was remounted and moved back to Cat-Tail Creek and bivouacked.

April 1, it relieved the Reserve Brigade in guarding the train and picketing the rear of the army. April 2, conducted train to Dinwiddie Court-House and marched to Hatcher's Run in the direction of Sutherland's Station. April 3, moved at daylight, crossed the South Side Railroad at Sutherland's Station, and later in the day resumed the march westward toward the Danville railroad till 1 a.m. the 4th instant. Bivouacked a few hours, and started at 4 a.m. the morning of the 4th instant. Marched rapidly via Dennisville to a point on the Danville railroad a few miles east of Burkeville Junction. By order of the major-general commanding the division a detachment of the First Maine was sent to cap the railroad. Toward evening marched to Jeter's Station, dismounted, threw up a breast-work of rails and
