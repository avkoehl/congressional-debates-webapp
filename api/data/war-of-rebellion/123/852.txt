Owing to the sudden vast increase of our military establishment, the demand for arms and other ordnance stores to be supplied with dispatch was far in excess of the greatest possible productive capacity of our public arsenals and private manufacturing establishments fitted for such work. Resort was therefore had to purchases in foreign countries in order to meet immediate requirements, and to increasing the manufacturing capacity of our arsenals and the development of private sources of supply, in order to have within ourselves the means of meeting future wants and they might occur. By the former was have been enabled to arm, equip, and otherwise supply the large bodies of troops which have been called into the service; not always, however, with first- class arms, such as this department turns out from its armories and secures from our own private factories by its system of inspection, but still with such as were serviceable and of the best kind and quality which it was possible under the circumstances to procure. The distribution of the arms, classified according to their degrees of excellence and quality, has been regulated by the fair principle of supplying the troops from each State with arms of the respective classes proportional to the number of troops from that State. By the latter we have advanced our productive capacity from 22,000 stand of arms, the annual production of both national armories before that of Harper's Ferry was destroyed, to at least 200,000, and from the 1st of January next probably 24,000 per annum from the single armory at Springfield, in the State of Massachusetts, making a product of one month at that armory equal to the former product of both armories for a whole year. Besides this source of supply, there are now in operation and engaged in furnishing the Government private manufactories of arms which will probably turn out in the next six months 220,440 stand of small-arms of the different kinds requisite for cavalry and foot troops, and with a present capacity equal to supplying thereafter at the rate of 350,000 muskets and rifles and 115,000 other small-arms per annum, making a total productive capacity of upward of 700,000 small-arms annually. The measures which have been adopted by and through this department will enable it in a short time to replace every arm in service not of the first class by one of the best quality and kind, and to place in store enough arms of the same description to meet the probable losses and damages from all causes. They have already resulted in restricting our purchases of foreign arms to those of the first class, and enabling us to fix far limits to prices and effectually suppress all attempts at speculation and extortion.

The resources of our own country are ample to supply for an indefinite period all our possible wants for such munitions of was as are provided through the Ordnance Department, and the longer the
