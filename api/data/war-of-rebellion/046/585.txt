brigade, together with the Tenth Connecticut, Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, and Second South Carolina, which were assigned to my column, by the causeway and foot-bridges which lead across the swamp to Cole's Island. I caused the brigdes to be destroyed behind me, and thus prevented pursuit. I arrived at the mouth of Stono the morning of the 17th, about sunrise.

It affords me pleasure to bear testimony to the good conduct of the officers and men of my command, both while under fire and enduring the fatigue and hardships incident to the operations.

I remain, yours, respectfully,

W. W. H. DAVIS,

Colonel 104th Pennsylvania Vols., Commanding Brigade.

Captain ADRIAN TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, TERRY'S DIVISION,Folly Island, S. C., July 18, 1863.

CAPTAIN: In answer to your favor of the 17th instant, directing me to send in to your headquarters, as soon as possible, a list of the killed, wounded, as missing in my command in the action of James Island, July 16, I have the honor to state tht there were no casualties in my brigade upon that occasion, with the exception of a wound received by Private Thomas Dorr Knight, First Massachusetts Cavalry, one f my mounted orderlies. I had occasion to send him to the front, when he received a volley of musketry from the rebel infantry, which wounded both himself and horse. He was shot in the right leg below the knee, but the wound is not dangerous.

It affords me pleasure to call the attention of the brigadier-general commanding to the good conduct of the officers and men of my command. The right of my line was under a heavy fire of artillery, and it seems providential that my men escaped unhurt.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. H. DAVIS,

Colonel 104th Pennsylvania Vols., Commanding Brigade.

Captain ADRIAN TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
