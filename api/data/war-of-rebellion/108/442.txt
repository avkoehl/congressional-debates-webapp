HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Goldsborough, January 16, 1862.

His Excellency H. T. CLARK,

Governor of North Carolina:

GOVERNOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant. No arms have yet arrived here for Leventhorpe's or Lee's regiments, or saers for Sprnill's. When they do I will attend to your request. I am fearful that the arms to be sent from Richmond will be too late to meet the fleet should it land upon our coast. A reply to an inquiry as to when I might expect them says they will be forwarded as soon as possible. These repeated delays and failures to fill requisitions must prove fatal to us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General L. O'B. BRANCH,

Commanding, &amp;c., New Berne:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant. The columbiads for Fort Macon have not yet arrived, nor can I learn anything about them further than that they are said to have left Richmond. If we are ruined it will be by the negligence of our agents. They are essential to the defense of Fort Macon, and should have been there with four others three weeks ago. They cannot be spared from the fort, otherwise it would give me pleasure to order them to stop at New Berne. A dispatch from General Cooper says that nine transports headed for the capes this morning, loaded with troops. Keep up a daily communication with Cedar Point. Let me know of the first appearance of the fleet should it make an appearance on your part of the coast. I hope Hall's spies are faithful and have not ben entrapped.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.
