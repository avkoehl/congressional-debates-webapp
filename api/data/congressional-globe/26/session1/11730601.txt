Independent Treasury—Mr. Patriith:
H. of Reps.
Thirdly, by rec-mn* gold and sitter only, 'it is
ttót yon can effectually preVeát orle cns<?, iké
bankers in this country, from using for their own
ihiHridofcl sain the public Money collected from
alf «ther class -s. Hence the arfinisfion of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Cusmwo] tint it
was not so material where the money was kept, as
the kind in wbich it Wiis received- All perceive
and aimi', that if the pub'ic- money is deposited
with banks, bankers can, and do, calculate now
jauci jiaper they can fcsne,'^redicated on those de-
posites, bstnjr Itab'e, however, so far as iheir> re-
sponsibility is worth any thin?, for the amount de-
posited. Banks never issue, of circulated, one dol-
lar of their paper, whether they have suspended or
not, wfibout receiving interest for it, at ndt less
(b^n six per cent.'per ahntrm. Wow if the Govern-
ment receives their paper, the b^riSs-get 'heir inte-
rest from some qusrer, on die amount used by tne
OnvernmtHtjBod have to 'Xir extent a greyer cir-
culation, and thetefoVe tHfe tntjre gaio; End they
h'av« the credit which tijii (Soveniment, in reaeivin?
their paper, givts to t ie% institution?, lo still far*
th«r increase their circulation. In addition tofheie
advantage?, and peihap 3 greater than all, banker?
can ca'cula e, wuh ihs ^ame certainty, the «mount
of their paper which «-til be u«ed by the Govern-
ment, in any given pe-iod, as the Government can,
howgtuch it mil receive, and forth* amount used
by Tie Government, \\\ey knosv they will
íot jbe tun upon; therefore the amount used
by "the Go tern meó t becomes to the banks a
predicate or basis on wbich they can increase
their issues, precisely ps they con Id upon the same
amount actua'ly depo-ited; With ihi* add tional
advantage, that there is no liability for dfpovites.
Here you have at once "the reason why the whole
banking "interest of the country, is oppt s«d to the
Sub Treasury. AH the banks, whether yáu have
a^great Nu'jorial Bank br hot, are alike iot?rested
and affected  by having the revenue received in
bank paper instead of gold and silver. Andjt'is
e'qna'fy cfeatibatjbu cannot effectujrily prevent
banks from reaping private advantage from the
publicmoney,wiihoutreceiv nggOFdaodslveronly.
íiíihly, it, leaves the Government io the same
sítnaáon as the eitizeti, in not being compelled to
receive any kind ot money, which may be ofTeréJ,
or which those wiih whom it1 tran?ac*s business
■ may choose to put upon it. Trtfauld any ¡nrjan ?gree,
that the ctnst tu'ional provision which make*
nothing but gold and silver a legal fender, shotdd
be taken away end leave h'mat the mercy ofthoe
trith whom he deals^to be compelled'o receive
jlfSt such rroney as might be offered, without any
power tr discretion to refuse or to demand a dif-
ferent ©c better kLid? No one would; and the tb-
senc&of this provisioh* and of the discretion with
which it In vests one man as well as another, would
bt the end of all credit aud internal commerce in
this country. This right can be regarded or not
by the citizen in each particular case, in his deal-
ings; be may or may or may not demand gold and
silver; (and he may of may not receive such money
asjs offered ,himj but he cannot be compelled to
receive bad inoneyA such as counterfeit paper or
coinf nor notes of ^"broken or worthless banks.
Not so with the Go^er,nment; it mast act by uni-
versal rule or Jaw, ajict waaHt receives from one
it must receive^frolin all. f Itjcannot dt termine in
each particufa/ case,,to ,'accept or refuse, at dis-
cretion, what is offered,' .as the citizen can.
therefore, whtn yiu c&njipel 'he Government
Ú receive paper for its du|s, ybu leave it
wuhout that power which the citizen possesses..
And whilst it is compelled to receive paper, which
may and does become worthless to it >etit is com-
pelled^ by the Constitution, if demandléd^ (and
every person drawing money „from the Treasury
may require if,) top3y.out gold and silver only.
Now,l ask, is there any man who has so litle re 
gard for his country, ¡a? to desire to see ltsXJovern-
ment in a worse condition, as to its contracts and
financial concerns, th%n he Would b1 himself ?t To
obvjate this difficulty, as far as possible, when Con-
gr^auljiorizerfybé tgcejpt pTpaper forjmblic,dues,
ítírrvestecl the President and^dfficeispfGcfveMment
with power_over. the súhjeát, as well whilbt the
^^i#M^^.*ft^^' ■« waer the,
a
S>ve bank depose system, and to that ext nt r -
moved the cowtrol of the Treasury from the Go 
vertfment. For the truth of this, see the resolution
ot 1816.
Sixthly, it takes *Way all discretion froth the
President atfd hw officers in regard to ihe Treasury
of the United States, ami cufts off this source of
Executive patronage. ' They can neither alter the
kind of money to be received, the place «here it is
to be kept, nor the class of officers of Government
who are lo be charged with its custody. It leaves
the whole matter exclusively tinder the control of
Congres*, which has not been the case since the
Goveinment ¡became connected with the first
United States 'Baulk in it  fiscal operations.
Seventhly, it leaves the Government in complete
possession and coStrolof its own means, in war and in
peace, without being liable to have its funds influ-
enced hy the "hanks, or tendered unavailable by
suspension, ás it1 has heretofore been, and as it was
more especially by the suspensión of 1837.
Eighthly, it prevents lo-ses te the Government
by depreciated bank paper, which, heretofore, by
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, docu-
ment No. 10, to this session, has amoun'ed to
$34,974,722, ah amount greater than from any
other source, as appears from the statements of
Government losses hereafter exhibited.
Ninthly, it will, in connection with the compro-
mise act which, after"1842, takes away credit from
importers, mrre effectual y th^n any other means
protect manufacturers and the coun'ry against ex-
cess' ve importations of foreign merchandise, by
requirins trie ¡mpot<ers to provide for paying their
dunes before they dispose of their goo1«; and, also,
prevent losses to the Government on duty bond*,
which has, by the estímate of the President, in bis
last message, already been greater lhan from any
other source except on bank paper Next, as
to the kind of money to be p*id out by the Govern-
ment; this is defined Uyihe 20tband 21st sections
of the hill. This is ii new feature, not contained
it any law ór regulation for disbnrsihg the public
money,'that'has Tieretofori  existed, and must pre-
vent Govern tnent offi-vrs, agents, and others, from
speculating on the Governn ent fund?, at the ex-
pense of the Government cred tor. It enforces
now, as a duty-, on the G iverntnent and its officer-*,
in all cases of paying out money, that which be-
fore has only been done when imrwat'vely demand-
ed. It returns to the people a-a n for crcu'ation
the* same kind of currency whi-b Has been c< fleeted
from Ihefh; anrf as eVery dorifiacfor or officer of
the Governmtmtecefves his' ddes in gold and sil-
v«r, every dlher"Citizen dealing With them w'iltbáVe
a right to expect and receive" the sam> kindof pay*
in return; and thus it s*ends back- into circulation,
amongst the people^ the same kind of currency
which rias^ been collected from therri. Why this
should b° án obj-ction, it s^ems? hard tó"perceive.
1 proceed now to examine the third prioéipíe of
ft* h'll—the places or locations Where ihe p'ubltc
monev shall be deposited, anU utidef whose imme-
diate control.
First, th* places of deposite*; They afe flifed bf
the 1st, 21, 3d, and 4'ft seclffliH of the bill at
Boston, New York, Phi'adelphia, Charleston, and
New Orleans, the greatest commercial points in the
Union, where the greatest amirunt Of motey is re-
ceived into the Treasury from duties; and at St.
L"uis—the central and mo^t convenient point to all
the S'ates, where money is" received, from 'piihiic
lands, together with Washington City, the seat of
Government.
These places are most convenient for receiving
and paying out for every section of the country.
By thii arrangement of location, it can never be-
come necessary to transfer very large sums of the
public money from one section of the Union to the
other. To illustrate this, all the money received
from public lands will beneeded an! paid out is
the Western ,Stítes; an-1 hence St. Louis, for the
convenience of all tho<e States, is the most central
and proper; and so of alt the other points or places
fixed by thehilU
Secondly, the' persons under whos« frcniediate
control the public money shall he kept. These ar#
pointed out by the <th, 8th,.KHh, and 11th, sections
of the bill; and they make every officer receiving
pu blic money, w hether one do! lar or milhonst the mo-
ment it comes in his possession, •chatgeable
with it a> public funds alone, distinct and
sf párate from his own private means, and as such,
whiM v remains in his custody, to be reiatntd by
him «s public money only. It makes another set
of officers, «even in numbfr, (three of whom already
exiit, and four to be aop unted,) th kfepers of the
mone\ at the Treasury of the United States, (and
each of the ether roi  ts or loca'ii ns fixed by the
bill.) from the t ns it v recuved, ctntil it i> paid
out. It would be difficult it we were disposed
to look at these provisions, tiee irom partitan feel-
ings, to disco.er objections to then; and yet in
nothing have the leaders (f theOpp s tion labored
so haul, and perhips with letter succe s, than in
striving to abme the public mind on this point, and
thereby prejudice the whole measure I am ready
to admit that under all Govemmmts, aud aKo,
under our own, froai i s commencement to the pre-
sent time, los^e^ ha v.* bem su^taintd by public
officers. But v hat kind of officer* were thofcl
They have be"n, pi d a~c the officers who receive,
and the officers who pay out the public rponey, and
not the officers who merely kee u? Can, or does
any Government on earth manase its pubic mo-
ney, without receiving and disbursing ofhrer ; and
can ours? Certainly jk>i ' England and France,
which have been he'd up by the Opposition as
pittews in financial matters, have thess officer-,
although they have their Government banks. And
could, ( r did this Government, dispense with those
officer  [to reentre, and piy out thf publ c money,]
when it bad a National Bank? It could not and
it did not. Nei.her of ihp Unitpd States Banks in
thi- counfy, ever receive 1 (r paid out the public
money. N r do, or can the Givernrnent banks of
other cr uuines. This Government from its com 
menerment has always employrd its rfficer«, pnd
thrtujh them, lo^sos have ireen sus ained, whither
a National Bnnk or a State bank or nei her, kept
th? public iro ey. To s.how this, I have prepared
the following table from  he report of the Secretary
A TABl E *hnwin the amount of money received and.paid
out during each Pfesid.enti.il term, ar d including three years
olMi Van Buieii's administra ion, exciii-iveol public debt,
