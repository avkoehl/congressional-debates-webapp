THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

such an appropriation as this. The paragraph
is ruled out.
The Clerk read as follows :
To provide for the payment of horses and other
property lectin the military service of the United
States, SSTjO.O^O.
Mr. CULLOM. I make the point of order
that there is no law providing for the appro-
priation in this paragraph. If there were any
law I suppose it has been, repealed.
The SPEAKER. The point of order is
stronger in this case than the other, and the
Chair rules the paragraph out.
Mr. MAYNAKD. Has not this been esti-
mated for?
Mr. DAWES. This is precisely upon the
same ground as the other case. The law is
upon the statute-book ; but the appropriation
to pay it has been repealed by the law of last
session.
Mr. MAYNARD. This is to carry out the
law. There is a law, and this appropriation
is to enable the Department to execute it.
Mr. PAINE, of Wisconsin. I do not think
the gentleman understands this correctly.
There is a law providing for the payment of
horses of officers lost in battle; but appro-
priation under that law, I presume, is made
in the regular Army appropriation bill.
The SPEAKER. _ The Chair fee Is com-
pelled to rule that it is not in order.
The Clerk read as follows:
For continuing the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf
coast of the United States, and Lake Champlain, in-
cluding compensation of civilians engaged m the
Hvoik, and excluding pay and cinolumentsof officers
of the Army and Navy and potty officers and 111011
of the Navy employed in the work, $3U1,OO0.
Mr. DAWES. I offer the following amend-
ment:
At the end of the paragraph add tho following:
Together with a.ny unexpended balances of former
appropriations which would be otherwiso covered
into the Treasury by existing law.
Mr. MAYNAllD. Does the gentleman from
Massachusetts wish to say something in refer-
ence to that amendment?
Mr. DAWES. Not at present.
Mr. MAYNARD. I desire, then, to say a
word in that connection. The Coast Survey
began under the act of the 10th of February,
1807, between sixty and seventy years ago. I
will read the first section of the act, which
gives the substance of what was contemplated
bj it :
"That the "President of the United States shall bo,
and he is hereby, authorized and requested to ca,use
a survey to be taken of the coasts of the United
States, in which shall be designated the islands and
shoals, with the roads or places of anchorage, within
twenty leagues of any part ot the shores of the Uni-
ted States; as also the rcspcctivo courses and dis-
tances between tho principal eapes or headlands,
together with such other matters as ho may deem
proper for completing an accurate chart of every
part of tho coasts within the extent aforesaid."
That is the origin of the Coast Survey. This
continued until the year 1818, when Congress
made the further provision—
"That so much of the third section of tho act
passed tho lOih day of February, 1807, entitled "An
act to provide for surveying the coasts of the United
States," as authorizes the employment of other per-
sons m the execution of said act than the persons
belonging to the Army and Navy be, and the same
is hereby, repealed"—
confining the work of the Coast Survey to the
Anny and Navy. That continued from 1818
up to the year 1832, when an act was passed
which provides:
" That the President of tho United States be, and
he is hereby, authorized, in and about theexecution
of thesaid act, to useallmaps,charts, books, instru-
ments, and apparatus which now or hereafter may
belong to the United States, and employ ail persons
in the land or naval servico of the United States,
and such astronomers and other persons as he shall
deem pioper."
Urder those words,'" such astronomers and
other persons as he shall deem proper," the
whole of this vast establishment has sprung
up. The first superintendent of the Coast Sur-
vey was Mr. Hassler. He was succeeded by
the late superintendent,, Mr. Bache. And the
law was amended as follows :
"The salary of tho superintendent of the Coast
Survey shall be $6,000per annum; and it shall be the
duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, annually, to
report to Congress, during the first month of each
regular session, the number and names of tho per-
sons employed during the last preceding liscal.year
upon the Coast Survey and business connected there-
with ; the amount of compensUtion of every kind
respectively paid them, for what purpose, and the
length of time employed; and further, to report a
full statement of all other expenditures made under
the direction of the superintendent of tho Coast
Survey."
I have several of the reports made by the
late superintendent, and to one of them I wish
especially to call the attention of the House;
"The organization of the Coast Survey, under
the act of Congress of 1832 has so repeatedly been
explained and its advantages enforced that it is
unnecessary to dwell upon it now further than to
remark that it continues to eommend itself by cBi-
ciency and economy, and by its peculiar adaptation
to thescientific and practical character of the work.
The principle that the work is temporary, to be urged
onward to completion as fast as tho moans ea.n be
obtained, and not tho work of a permanent corps,
is a cardinal ono. Tho power of the Treasury De-
partment, under the law, to regulate tho compen-
sations of tho civilians thus temporarily employed
is one great source of the success of tho work, giving
it vitality by recognizing tho principle of promotion
by merit."
It was stated the other day by the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania [Mr. Dickky] that this
work must be permanent. That was not the
opinion of the former superintendent, as will
be seen by the paragraph I have just quoted
from his report. He declares that " the prin-
ciple that the work is temporary is a cardinal
one."
Mr. DAWES. The amendment has been
opposed. I ask for a vote upon it.
Mr. KERR. I desire to move to amend the
amendments. 1 propose to substitute " two "
for "three " in line seven hundred and seventy-
eight ; and I do it for the purpose of asking
the gentleman from Massachusetts what the
amount is that lie desires to add to this appro-
priation by this amendment. He gives the
House no information upon the subject. IIo
simply proposes to embrace certain previous
appropriations that have beeu covered into the
Treasury. I desire to know what the amount
of them is.
Mr. DAWES. Under the act of last year,
when the-1st of July comes, all of the appro-
priations for the last year that have not"been
expended on this work will go into the Treas-
ury. The object of this amendment is to con-
tinue them along for this purpose. How much
they will be of course it is impossible for me
to state now. It will be only what is left of
last year's appropriations aiid is notexpended
on the 1st of July. The section of last year
providing for the covering of unexpeuded bal-
ances into tho Treasury was not intended to
reach such objects as public works that must
go on continuously and canuut be stopped at
any particular time. Sometimes the object for
which an appropriation is made cannot be fin-
ished within the year—it takes a little longer
time; and if the appropriation drops into the
Treasury, on a given day it embarrasses the
public works.
Mr. KERR. But the report ought to show
what tho amount is which has been dropped
into the Treasury.
Mr. DAWES. Nothing has gone into the
Treasury yet.
Mr. KERR. But the gentleman ought to
know what the amount of it is.
Mr. DAWES. Nothing has been brought
back into the Treasury as yet. It is only such
unexpended balances of the present year as
may happen to be left when the 1st of July
comes that are to be carried along for the next
year. That is the object of the amendment.
Whether there will be a dollar of unexpended
balance or not depends upon how the expend-
itures will go on.
Mr. MAYNARD. I move to strike out the
last word of the amendment, for the purpose
of saying that I hare found it somewhat diffi-
cult to find out the state of this fund. The
law which I have read required the Secretary
of the Treasury to make an annual report dur-
ing the first mouth of each session of Con-
gress. I applied at the document-room for
the reports for the last two years, but was
unable to find them. I addressed a note to
the Secretary of the Treasury, and received a
reply that he referred it to the Coast Survey,
and the response from that office is the manu-
script which I hold in my hand, giving the
expense up to the 1st of June, 18(39, but no
later. Now, I find that for the year 18G7-68
we appropriated $150,000; next year we
appropriated $025,000; for the current year
$643,000, and this bill proposes to appropriate
5600,000. And not only that; but this amend-
ment proposes that we shall give in addition
to the $000,000 unexpended balances amount-
ing to a considerable sum. I ask the attention
of the House to the following list of the offi-
cers employed in that Department, with their

Sir, this is a matter that the House ought to
look into. It is a matter that requires exam-
ination. It is one of those things which has
been growing up •without the knowledge and
observation of Congress. If you wiJi look at
the report of the Secretary of the Interior for
this year you will find that the report of the
superintendent of this bureau covers just two
pages, and if you can make anything out of ifc
you will do more, I imagine, than the author
of the report intended you should do. I trust
that before any further appropriations are made
for this work the House will understand how
it is that these appropriations have fteen con-
tinually increasing. I am prepared to show,
and will do so before we get through with this
discussion, l'f I have an opportunity, that we
had a promise as early as 1857 that the work
should be done in at least ten or twelve years.
