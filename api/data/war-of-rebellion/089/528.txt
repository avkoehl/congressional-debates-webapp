CITY POINT, VA., November 6, 1864-2 p. m.

(Received 3.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Last night a little after 11 o'clock, the enemy attacked the picket line in front of Gibbon's and Mott's divisions, of Second Corps, and, carried about forty of the pits occupied by pickets. Stubborn fighting was kept up from that time until near daylight, resulting in the enemy being driven to their own lines with considerable slaughter. Besides the dead and wounded carried back by the enemy, quite a number are still left in the picket trenches and vicinity. Forty-two prisoners were also captured and some entrenching tools. General Gibbon's loss is estimated at fifteen or twenty captured. General Mott says his loss will be small, but does not yet give numbers.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Hancock reports that a few minutes before 12 a sharp musketry fire broke out near Fort Morton, and that the firing is apparently picket-firing, accompanied by the opening of the mortar batteries. The firing has now nearly ceased.

General HUMPHREYS:

One of my staff returned from Fort Haskell. As near as he could ascertain the enemy advanced a strong skirmish line in front of that fort, but they did not accomplish anything. I know of no damage done thus far.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Major-General Hancock reports his picket-line was attacked last night at 11.40 both in Gibbon's and Mott's fronts. On the former, some eight men were captured, and on Mott's line the enemy succeeded in capturing some twenty posts and about 100 yards of the line which he held till just before daylight, when he was repulsed with heavy loss in killed and wounded, leaving one officer and forty men of the Holcombe Legion in our hands. The rest of the lines were quiet during the day and night.

Major-General.
