HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 15, 1864-3.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch received. There are no indications at present that the enemy are crossing the Ny. We will probably be able to hold our own. General Birney's right strikes the Ny River at a point opposite the deserted house on the other side of the river, which house is about or nearly on a line from your headquarters to Landrum's house. If that point can be occupied by a brigade and a battery, it would be of great service to us in case of an attack. I mean the point on which the deserted house stands.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 15, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I am inclined to think that the point designated as the deserted house in my last dispatch should be occupied as soon as possible. It is reported that the enemy are passing to our right and aiming for that place. There is supposed to be about a brigade passing.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,In the Field, May 15, 1864-4.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General Grant refers the within dispatch of General Burnside to General Meade, with the suggestion, that it might be well to watch from the deserted house with cavalry, and if a brigade moves on that point, to attack it with a division.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

Major-General Hancock will occupy the deserted house with such force as he may deem necessary to comply with the within suggestion of the general commanding.

MEADE.

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 15, 1864.

The Army of the Potomac, except Birney's division, which is with you have all been notified to advance and attack the enemy in case you are attacked by him.

Lieutenant-General.
