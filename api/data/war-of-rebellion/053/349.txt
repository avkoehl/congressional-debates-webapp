Respectfully forwarded.

I don't know how dependent the army at Chattanooga is upon the present line for supply, but I think the railroad might be extended so as to save wagon transportation for at least 6 miles with very little expense. I forward the quartermaster's report for the general's information.

(Received 3.40 a.m., 14th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

There are over 4,000 troops without arms. The troops are unsafe in camp, and will be dispersed or captured by guerrilla bands. Troops are needed for defense. Cannot these troops be armed as soon as enlisted and enrolled? Will your order the ordnance officer here to furnish arms on requisition of the officers, approved by General Boyle? Will you have ordnance officer here supplied with proper arms, or will you give authority for State to purchase arms?

By order of the Governor:

S. G. SUDDARTH,

Quartermaster-General.

RHEATOWN, TENN., October 13, 1863.

(Received 1.10 a.m., 14th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-chief:

We now occupy the country again up to near Carter's Station, and can in all likelihood hold it that far if no necessity exists to send forces to Rosecrans. We cannot hold this section of the country if any considerable portion of our force goes to Rosecrans. The necessity therefore exists for the retention of our whole force, or for the evacuation of East Tennessee in order to join Rosecrans with our whole force. The movements of the troops up here at this time halve already attracted a considerable portion of the enemy's force at Athens.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
