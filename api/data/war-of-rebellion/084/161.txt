Brigadier-General FISK, Glasgow, Mo.:

GENERAL: Your request will be met promptly. Movements will commence from Kansas and Saint Joe to-night, if possible, My force at Weston is ready. A full regiment should be sent from below. You have not at this writing a soldier of your department in Platte or Clay, the worst part of the country. What you had have run away or joined the traitors. My troops must not go far, as the rebels will seek the occasion to strike Kansas.

Major-General CURTIS:

I thank you for your hearty co-operation in the combined movement against the Confederates and Paw Paws, who hold Platte City in the name of Jeff. Davis. I trust that there will be no prisoners taken by our boys, and that a lesson will be taught Platte County that will be wholesome and admonitory to other localities where the Paw Paw tribes to congregate. I am hard at work organizing the militia. Oh, for troops! reliable troops!! troops!!! I shall visit Saint Louis before I return to Saint Joseph, unless the rebels become strong and capture me. I have been bushwhacked once only, as yet.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your telegram of last evening is received. My fears have been realized. I hope that both the State and national authorities will no longer consider me too credulous and distrustful. I have again a similar application from Hannibal and other cities and towns. The demand for arms for the 107 organization will exceed our supply, I fear. I have asked General Rosecrans for an abundance of arms and ammunition and shall probably go and see him before I return to Saint Joseph. consult freely with General Craig, but the governed by what you know to be my views. Colonel Draper ought not to have accompanied the railway expedition. Is hall hurry him and his men to your support. It rust the Platte County officers are not as bad ad they appear. I have done all I could with the means in my hand to prevent the calamities now upon us. I am now working day and night to get the Enrolled Missouri Militia in this region into active service.
