Assistant Adjutant-General, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

COLONEL: I inclose you the correspondence of Lieutenant-General Smith with Brigadier-General Helm,* the commander of my depot at Chattanooga. A short time since the chief quartermaster and chief commissary of General Smith's department gave orders for the breaking up of my depot of supplies at Chattanooga, and the transportation of my stores to Knoxville.
