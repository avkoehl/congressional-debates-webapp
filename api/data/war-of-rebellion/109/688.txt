his reponsible duties with ability and faithfulness, and the system he has introduced into his office has been of the greatest service to the department. Paragraphs III and IV, and paragraph V, except sections 1 and 4, and also paragraphs VII and VIII oif General Orders, Numbers 39, and the forms accompanying the order, do not come under the scope of my duties. I, however, transmit herewith the reports of my depot officers, showing the amount of material and supplies received and issued during the year at the depot of Nashville, marked, respectively, Exhibits Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.* The officers of the department have performed their duties during the year in a creditable manner; some cases of malfeasance in office have occurred, which have been punished by court-martial and dismissal, but, as a general rule, when the magnitude of operations and the large amount of public money and material handled are considered, it must be acknowledged that the quartermaster's department in the Department of the Cumberland has been as faithfully administered as any other department in the vast area of operations. It only remains to mention the officers who have served under my immediate orders, and whom I deem worthy of notice: Colonel A. J. Mackay, chief quartermaster, Army of the Cumberland, served with the army through all its brilliant operations, from the march to Atlanta to the battle before Nashville, witnessing its gradual and fianl dissolution as an army. During this time he perfomred his complicated duites to the entire satisfaction of Major General George H. Thomas, commanding, and I need hardly say of mine, and I cannot speak too highly of his ability, faithfulness, and devotion to duty. Captain James F. Rusling, assistant quartermaster, was my chief assistant quartermaster from 1st of July, 1864, to 7th of May, 1865, when he received his appointment as inpsector Quartermaster's Department. During the Atlanta campaign and afterward he was of great assistance to me in the work of supplying the army, and I witnessed his well-earned promotion with pleasure. Captain F. J. Crilly, assistant quartermaster, U. S. Army, was under my orders as disbursing officer U. S. Military Railroads, Military Division of the Mississippi. He performed these responsible duties satisfactorily, disbursing a vast amount of public money with discretion and dispatch, bringing his office down to an admirable system, and displaying large administrative abilities, abilities which were invaluable in his position, as it was a new field, and he could have easily saved or squandered a million and no one be the wiser. I earnestly recommend him for the brevet of lieutenant-colonel. Captain M. D. Wickersham, assistant quartermaster, served on the staff of Major General George H. Thomas, commanding Army of the Cumberland, from July 1 to September 15, 1864, as inspecting quartermaster, ARmy of the Cumberland, from September 15, to May 18, 1865, and from May 18 to June 30, 1865, in my office as chief assitant quartermaster, Department of the Cumberland. In these several positions he has displayed industry and ability, and no young officer of his rade has a handsomer or more creditable record of services. Bvt. Colonel Charles H. Irvin, assistant quartermaster, and Captain Charles T. Wing, assistant quartermaster, have already been noticed in this report; both have been invaluable in their positions. Captain C. K. Smith, Jr., assistant quartermaster, was in charge of the depot of Cahttanooga from July 1, 1864, to June 30, 1865. During all this time, and particularly during the Atlanta campaign, he performed his duties with ability and dispatch. Captain S. B. Brown,
