section of the act approved April 20, 1871.
Mr* BLAlK. addressed the Senate at length.
[His speech will be found in the Appendix.]
Mr. SCO'IT. From the number of Sena-
tors who have signified a desire to speak on
this bill, I am Satisfied that in order to give
them an opportunity, a recess should be taken.
I therefore move that at half past four o'cloek
to-day the Senate take a recess until half
past seven o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Ferry,
of Michigan, in the chair.) If no amendment
be offered, the bill will be reported to the
Senate.
Mr, GASSERLY. Let it be read for inform-
ation.
Mr. BLAIK. My colleague on the com-
mittee, the Senator from Delaware, [Mr. Bay-
ard,] desires to be heard on the bill.
The Chief Clerk read the bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No amend-
ment being offered, the bill will be reported to
the Senate without amendment.
Mr. THURMAN. The Senator from Del-
aware and other Senators propose to speak on
the bill, aad I think it might as well be kept in
committee.
Mr. CONKLING. It is immaterial.
Mr. CASSERLY. I beg the Senator's pat-
don ; I do not think it is.
Mr. SPENCER. I was out of my seat
when the Senator from Missouri referred to
my State, and I should like him to repeat his
stateajeat of the indebtedness of the State of
Alabama, if he has no objection. I under-
stand that he placed it at a much larger amount
than it really is.
Mr. BLAIR. About thirty-eight million
dollars,
Mr. SPENCER. Mr. President, the in-
debtedness of the State of Alabama in July,
18G0, according to the authentic reports of
officials, wits $5,939,654 87. In M.iy, 1865,
according to the comptroller'sreport, this debt
had swelled to $19,315,918 40, of which $13,-
094,731 95 was the Siate rebel war debt, sub-
sequently repudiated by authority of Congress.
Certainly the gentleman does not desire to
charge this war debt upon the "inexperienced
and, in many instances, corrupt adventurers"
of whom he has spoken so ofien.
I desire to call the Senator's attention to the
following official statement, of Hon. R. M.
Reynolds, State auditor ot'Alabama:

On page 90 of auditor's report (30th September,
1871,) you will lind a full statement of the debt on
September 30,1871.
Bonds of the State to the amount ef $1,000,000'
Were issued in January last under an act ofCeneral
Assembly, These bonds are now on the market.
As it has been repeatedly charged that the debt
was' largely increased during the Republican
Making a total of $466,336 46
which had to be provided for at once, and before
tho revenue for the yeaf 1868 could be collected.
The rate of taxation for that year was three tenths
Of otie per cent., and the revenue derived theretrom
was not sufficient to meet the actual expenses of the
State government and interest on the public debt.
You will see by this that the actual increase of the
debt was small indeed, being $113,277 37.
In regard to the contingent liabilities of the State
for indorsement of railroad bonds, you will recol-
lect that the system of indorsement was inaugu-
rated by authority of an act of the General Assem-
bly, approved February 19. 1867, giving $12,000 per
mile indorsement, and an additional allowance lor
bridges, making an amount equal to $14,000 per mile.
XJnder an act of the General Assembly, approved
September 22,1868, the amount was fixed at $16,000
per mile with no extra indorsement for bridges, &c.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
U. M. REYNOLDS, Audilor.
Hon. Geo. E, Spencer, _ ,. _ _
United States Senator, Washington, D. C.
From this official statement, all of which
will be found published in the State Docu-
ments of Alabama for 1871 and 1872, pages
90 and 91, it will be observed that the total
increase in the State indebtedness from July,
1868, the date of the inauguration of the free-
State government, to January, 1871, was the
sum of $579,613 83; and of this amount
$354,761 46 was actually due at the time for
the debts of the previous government, the pro-
visional government of Andrew Johnson, and
not wjiat is known as the "Republican gov-
ernment" of Alabama, the actual increase
being only $113,277 37.
If Democratic authority will have more
weight than Republican with the distinguished
Senator from .Missouri, I respectfully call his
attention to the message of the present Gov-
ernor, Hon. R. B. Lindsay, transmitted to the
Legislature of Alabama, November 21,1871,
which will be found on page 22 of the same
volume of State Documents:
"The public debt is not $8,761,917 37; it is only
$5,442,300 according to his own tabular statement.
Tne university and other funds, what is known as
the Patloii certificates, and accounts unsettled or
auditor's warrants unp.iid, which he uses tu make
up the other $3,913,617, do not constitute, in any ac-
cepted signification of the term, public debt, and
their inclusion as such, unwarranted and unex-
plained, greatly tends to damage the value of the
State securities. This error on the part ot the aud-
itor was adverted to by my predecessor in his an-
nual me>sage to the General Assembly on the 15th day
of November, 1869, m the following comprehensive
paragraph: „ „ „
"'The auditor is a faithful and efheient officer;
but I am constrained to express inv dissent from the
views embodied m his reportin regard to the school
fund. He says, in effecr, that the fund has been lost
or misapplied by the State. It rs perfectly clear to
ray mind that his reasoning and conclusion arc based
upon a misapprehension of the laws ot Congress
under which the fund was created, and the constitu-
tion and laws of the Srate under wnich it is con-
trolled."'
If the statement of the Democratic Gover-
nor of Alabama be not sufficient to convince
the gentleman from Missouri of his error in
reference to our State indebtedness, I beg
leave to invite his attention to the following
editorial from the Montgomery Advertiser
and Mail, of date April 10, I872y in which it
will be observed this Democratic organ dis-
poses summarily of the debt question, and
asks, u Why such statements? Cui bono?'*
Will the distinguished Senator from Missouri
inform Colonel Robert Tyler, the editor of
tins journal, why he has made such statements
and cui bono:
" Whi/ such statements? Cut t><>no ?—"We observe
that our young friend of the Marion Commonweal th
has published a statement calculated at this time to
do gieati injury fo the people of the.State, We be-
lieve, of course, that he had no such intention, but
the mischievous effect of his publication is the
same, whether his intentions be good or bad, atd
bad we know they are not.. The following is an ex-
tract from the article to which we refer;
" 4Thisis the nice little bill made by carpet-baggers
and scalawags, afid the people are now asked to
foot it:
Overissue of Alabama and Chattanooga indorsed
. bonds ..       $500,000
Alabama and Chattanooga road, straight
bonds ,  2,000,000
Alabama and Chattanooga road, indotsed
bonds    1,920.000
South and North road, indorsed bonds  600,000
Montgomery and Eufaula road, straight
bonds    300,000
Mobile and Montgomery road, indorsed

East Alabama and Cincinnati road, indorsed
bonds        80,000
Selma, Marion, and Memphis road, indorsed
bonds    80,000
Total fraudulent debt   $7,980,000
" Interest to be paid annually $638,400; more than
half the total revenue of the State; but the "inno-
cent bondholders must be protected. Alas 1 for the
poor guilty people.
"Now, really, there are but two items among
those mentioned on which the State has ever paid
or is likely to pay a dollar of interest. These are
the two items relating to the Alabama and Chatta-
nooga railroad. This railroad is now in the bank-
rupt court with the liens of the State all carefully,
protected, and unless there be some untimely and
unpatriotic interruption of the proceedings in the
bankrupt court, it is to be hoped that the State will
be reimbursed her entire expenditure in full, made
in behalf of her engagements in connection with
the Alabama and Chattanooga road. If so, she will
have saved her good faith and her money both. Sbe
has never taxed a man in the State yet for a dollar
of interest, and no citizen of this generation will
ever have to pay a dollar of tax on account of this
road. No interest has ever been paid for the South
and North road, the Mobile and Montgomery road,
nor any other road mentioned, unless it may bo
about thirty thousand dollars for the Montgomery
and Eufaula road. Why, then, such unfounded
statements?
"We have no wish or intention to mitigate the in-
dignation felt by our people .in regard to the charac-
ter of the Radical railroad legislation in certairf
respects. But it is impossible not to feel, as impol-
itic, profligate, and injurious as that legislation may
have been, that it was but little less mischievous to
the credit and true interests of the State than such
statements as those we are now commenting on. It
is in point of fact all thissenselessclamor, construed
into adisposition to repudiate the State's obligations
and to destroy the rail roads now in the process of
construction, that has so deplorably affected tbesale
of the State bonds of Alabama in New Yoik and
other markets. It is this and nothing else.
"With a small debt of not more than nine mil-
lion dollars; with comparatively hght taxes; with
a financial recoid unstained by a single act of repu-
diation or refusal to pay a just debtwith an im-
mense wealth to be easily developed in the future,
an unthinking, and for all practical purposes, un-
meaning clamor, has been raised and persistently
kept up, so that capitalists actually shrink from
investing their money in Alabama eight per cent.
State bonds, being lightened by the terrible bug-
aboo conjured up and shaken in their faces by
some irrepressible financiers and tender lovers of the
4 dear people'among us. The extreme tolly ot the
business is that the clamor would seem to be only
political; for not a man in the State expect.- to see
on? dollar of the Alabama and Chattanooga rail-
road bonds repudiated by the people or the Legisla-
ture, They know well that it cannot be done.
"The State is now engaged in an effort to sesl
$l,00U,UU0m bonds, a sum necessary tor her current
expenses. All such statements, and the suggestions
accompanying such statements, are seriously cal-
culated to impair hercredir and to compel her to sell
her obligations atalowand mortifying figure.'
There is still another circumstance to which
I call the attention of the Senator from Mis-
souri The State auditor, the only Republican
officer in the State government of Alabama,
reports the State debt in November, 1871. at
$8,701,917 37. The now Democratic Gov-
ernor insists that the Republican auditor has
overstated the debt to the amount of $3,319,017,
and that in truth and in fact thp debt is only
$-3,442,300, some three hundred thousand dul-
ars less than it was in 1860.
So much for the absolute debt of the State
of Alabama. The contingent debt, or liabili-
ties, as reported by the auditor, amounts to rho
sum of $15,420,000, of which $13,120,000 is for
indurserntnt of railroad bonds, and $2,300,000
issued bonds for railroad purposes,_ for which
the State is amply secured by first lien on the
roads. Not a dollar of tax has been levied
on account of this contingent debt, nor was a
dollar of this contingent liability incurred for
