It is now and ever has been my object to assist in every possible manner within my authority any portion of the army that requires my duty.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. COX,

Lieutenant Colonel, and Chief Commissary of Subsistence, 17th A. C.

OFFICE DEPOT COMMISSARY,

Vicksburg, Miss., January 18, 1864.

Colonel [COX]:

I had placed to the of Colonel Beckwith about 250,000 pounds pilot bread. I have had no order to ship it, however, and now our corps is living on the stock in hand, as per statement now furnished you.

I have sent to New Orleans as follows: Two steamboat-loads of pilot bread and meat. Captain [Richard E.] Davies has all the papers relating to said shipment, and I cannot give you the amount.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. GILPIN,

Captain, and Commissary of Subsistence.
