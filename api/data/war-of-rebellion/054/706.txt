MUNFORDVILLE, October 22, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Louisville:

Your dispatch received. Messenger just in from Greensburg. Rebels left there last night; at 12 o'clock returned south; they are by this time on the Cumberland. Robbed bank, stores, &amp;c.; they made no distinction. Part of the force went in direction of New Haven. It is supposed that only 50 or 100 left in that direction. The force sent from this place last night will pursue them. It embraces part of Thirty-third Kentucky, Captain Baker's company, Thirty-fifth Kentucky, and all the available mounted force at Glasgow. I have instructed Colonel Strickland to mount all the force he could at Glasgow, and look out for the party in every direction. I have used every saddle at this post to mount men last night. No horses here, no saddles at Glasgow. Is it necessary to pursue on foot? If you wish, as soon as I can get detachment will go to Greensburg and arrest all persons giving aid and comfort. Answer.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 22, 1863.

Captain SEMPLE, Louisville:

Say to Colonel Weatherford that all my force is out. They are either in pursuit of rebels going south from Greensburg or followed those going toward New Haven. Special messenger left with instructions for Captain Hare to move his mounted force in direction of Lebanon Branch. The remaining force left at Glasgow are without horses or equipments. If they will mount 100 men at Lebanon there will be no difficulty in driving the rebels from the road.

Brigadier-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

My cavalry and mounted infantry, 200 strong, left here last night, with instructions to get on track of rebels and follow them. I have sent special messenger to Captain Hare, at Nolin, to intercept them, if possible.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Have just arrived. I will write tomorrow. Please approve order placing General Sherman in command of Department and Army of the Tennessee, with headquarters in the field. I think it much preferable to leave departments as they are to consolidating the three into one.

U. S. GRANT.

Major-General, Commanding.
