I leave the consul to the Government at Washington. I will take care sufficiently to punish the other alien enemies and domestic traitors concerned in this business whom I have here.

Upon examination of the parties I found that a box containing all the papers relating to the transactions which were not kept with the commercial papers of the house of Gautherin &amp; Co. was usually deposited with the French consul. I wrote to him very politely to

have it delivered to me for the purpose of justice. I have again written him, more peremptorily, and he has refused to do so, still

concealing the proof of guilt. If produced, I believe it will show him to be one of the five parties concerned in this illegal traffic mentioned in the account of expenses. However that may be, he now covers the criminal, as he lately concealed the booty which he, his wife, and clerk have so largely shared.

I beg leave here to call the attention of the Department to these transactions as showing I was clearly right when I ordered the specie deposits in the hands of Count Mejan to be sequestered. His flag has been made the cover of all manner of illegal and hostile transactions and the booty arising therefrom. I am glad that my action here has thus been vindicated to the world, and that the Government of the United States will be able to demand of the French Government a recall of its treacherous and hostile agent.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
