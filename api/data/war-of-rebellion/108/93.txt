quartermaster's deaprtment, that under directions or advice from Richmond, he had directed the force fromt wo or threeof theese coutnies to be sent to the northwest. This will prevent me for some time, probably, from raising as large a force as two regiments, but I shall endeavor to raise as many as possible. I have herenow two rifle companeis and an infantry compay, which I will send on to Harper's Ferry as soon as they can possibly be equipped, which will be intwo or rthree days. There are also two cavalry companies here, called out a day or two before I reached here by major Harman, who intended them for the northwest. I shall, however, in compliance with your order of the 15th instant, this evening received, send at least one of the se companies to Harper; 's Ferry. The infantry and rifle companies I shall, unless otherwise directed by you, arm with the flint- lock muskets now here.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

John ECHOLS,

Lieutenant- Colonel of Volunteers.
