ularly commend the conduct of Colonel Kammerling, Ninth Ohio; Colonel Robinson, Seventy-fifth Indiana; Colonel Gleason, Eighty-seventh Indiana; Lieutenant-Colonel Tolles, One hundred and fifth Ohio; Lieutenant-Colonel Doan, One hundred and first Indiana; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishop, Second Minnesota, and Lieutenant-Colonel Boyton, Thirty-fifth Ohio. These officers discharged their duties coolly and ably.

Lieutenant-Colonel Boynton was severely wounded early in the engagement, when the command of his regiment devolved upon Major Buddy, who is entitled to much praise for the energy and skill he exhibited in leading his men up the ridge.

Especial credit is due Lieutenant-Colonel Bishop for the management of his regiment when skirmishing in front of the brigade, and the gallant manner in which his command carried the rifle-pits at the foot of the ridge. There are many line officers and enlisted men who deserve commendation for their gallantry. For their names I respectfully refer you to the reports of regimental commanders.

The members of my staff present with me on the field were Captain J. R. Beatty, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain C. A. Cilley, brigade inspector; Captain W. R. Tuttle, brigade engineer; First Lieutenant S. Fortner, provost-marshal; First Lieutenant S. D. Parsons, acting assistant quartermaster, and First Lieutenant C. B. Williams, aide-de-camp. They rendered me great service, and are entitled to praise for their gallant conduct.

I am, captain very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FERDINAND VAN DERVEER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
