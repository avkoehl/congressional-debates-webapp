OFFICE COMMANDANT OF CONSCRIPTS,

Montgomery, Ala., March 25, 1864.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding Department of Mississippi, &amp;c., Demopolis, Ala.:

GENERAL: I have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your communication of the 24th instant,* but regret that I cannot fully agree with you in regard to my duties relative to the supporting force placed under my control by the superintendent of conscription. Though I have perfect confidence in your disposition to advance the wishes of the Government in its every effort to support and recruit our armies, yet I cannot but think that the withdrawal from the immediate control of the Bureau of Conscription of a force which has been found so indispensable for the past six or eight months in the enforcement of the conscription laws will prove most detrimental to the service. As commandant of conscripts for this State I am charged not only with the enforcement of the conscript laws, but with the duty of arresting and returning to their commands all stragglers and deserters. A large portion of this State is in such a condition that the constant presence of an armed force is absolutely necessary to secure even respect. In some portions, even with the force at present engaged in this service, I am unable to overcome the armed resistance presented. In view of these facts, I feel confident it would be imposing a tax a heavier than you contemplate to render me the assistance necessary for this service.
