Lowell's brigade on the line so that the balance of your command can be used elsewhere. General Wilson is ordered to move in front of General Wright. There is an attack on Wilson's right. Lieutenant Goldsmith will give you more particulars.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,August 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General MERRITT,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The main body of the infantry is passing now. The infantry picket-line will be withdrawn shortly. Send for Colonel Lowell to keep himself posted as to the movements of the infantry in his rear, and have him withdraw to a point near the town, covering the roads on that side. Send a staff officer to report for further instructions.

Very respectfully,

M. A. RENO,

Captain and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Summit Point, August 21, 1864-11.10 a.m.

Brigadier-General MERRITT,

Berryville:

My outposts on the Winchester and Summit roads and at Middleway have been attacked by strong forces of cavalry. A part of the force between here and the Opequon has taken the road running toward Berryville. There seems to be a strong reconnaissance all along the line of the Opequon.

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Cross-Roads, One mile and a half East of Summit Point,

August 21, 1864-2.25 p.m.

General MERRITT:

Your dispatch* by my messenger just received. I'll hold on on this road till you come in. Have received orders to that effect from headquarters cavalry forces. About noon, my advanced parties having been driven from the Opequon, I was attacked by a division of infantry [and] one regiment of cavalry. At the same moment orders came directing me to fall back from Summit and attack the enemy in Wright's front. My artillery fire has checked the enemy, but he is reports as moving toward Berryville. Move, therefore, as rapidly as possible till we can form a junction. Your train is all right. You had better not stop on the Bullskin, but move till we meet. The enemy may catch you on the flank by some of the cross-roads.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
