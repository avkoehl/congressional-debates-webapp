Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

I have to request that you will, as soon as possible, in accordance with General Orders, Numbers 251, War Department, designate as separate brigades, in orders, the posts of Natchez and Vicksburg, and the District of Vicksburg. This is necessary to legalize the action of courts now in session, and I am constrained to make the request owing to the inconvenience of communication with the headquarters of Department and Army of the Tennessee.

Very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,
