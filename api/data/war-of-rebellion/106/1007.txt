in the rebel army; and as I wished to increase the force on the island, I sent Captain Black with his company of the Ninth Infantry, as Captain Black ranked Captain Winder. I did this with a view of quieting the public mind. In all the communications I ever received from Captain Winder, as well as frequent conversations with him, I was fully convinced of his perfect reliability and loyalty to the Government. At the frequent inspections I made of Alcatraz Island during his command I alvays found everyithing in the most satisfactory condition. His system of alarm signals to prevent surprise and general preparations to meet any emergency evinced a thorough knowledge of his duty and responsibility as commander of the most important defense of the harbor of San Francisco.
