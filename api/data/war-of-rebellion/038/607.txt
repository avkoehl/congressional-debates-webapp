Vicksburg, January 26, 1863.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

DEAR SIR: I am informed that Major Theodore Johnston, commissary of subsistence of the Department of Jackson, and M. N. Yocum, Government contract butcher, say that there are only about 3,000 Government cattle in the department. There are about 1,100 at Woodville, on the east side of the Mississippi River, which Major Johnston has ordered [or will order] to be bought. I am expecting 500 beeves here this evening and 600 more have been started for this place from Rodney some two days since.

Very respectfully,

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.

JACKSON, January 27, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON,

Vicksburg:

All troops arriving here to-night will go forward at once. Four engines in readiness to move.

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Vicksburg, January 27, 1863.

Major THEO Johnston, Chief Commissary, Jackson, MISS.:

There must be rations kept here all the time for 25,000 men. The men have no meat at all to-day.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, January 27, 1863.

Major General MARTIN L. SMITH, Vicksburg:

DEAR SIR: In answer to your note of this date, I have ample arrangements made to grind corn for 25,000 men per day. I have four pairs of stones at the Government mill in running order, three pairs of which are kept constantly at work, and they can grind about 400 bushels every ten hours. By running day and night, I can very easily turn out 800 bushels every twenty-four hours, and when the corn is dry and in good order can supply from 30,000 to 36,000 men per day.

Very respectfully,

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.

Vicksburg, January 27, 1863.

Major THEO. Johnston, Commissary of Subsistence, Jackson:

Not one beef here. Big Black up, and cannot tell when cattle can cross. When will the lot from Rodney arrive? Send us some by some means, as troops are suffering.

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.
