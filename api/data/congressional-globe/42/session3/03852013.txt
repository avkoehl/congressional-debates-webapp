Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to present a
paper in the nature of a memorial, which is
sent to me as chairman of the Committee on
Finance, which I deem it my official duty to
present. It is a special finding of the grand
jury of the circuit court of the United States
for the southern district of New York. The
special finding sets out alleged neglects of
duty by the late Comptroller of the Currency,
Mr. Hurlburd, and also memorializes in favor
of certain amendments to the banking act. It
is not addressed to the Senate formally, but is
addressed to me as chairman of the Commit-
tee ot^ Finance, and I deem it my duty to pre-
sent it for what it is worth. I do not know
what disposition ought to be made of it. It is
not an indictment, but the finding of the grand
jury in the nature of a memorial. As it is
addressed to me officially, I deem it my duty
to present it to the Senate for any reference
they may choose to make of it. Probably the
proper reference would be to the Committee
ou Finance.
Mr. FENTON. I suggest that it lie on the
table a short time. I should be glad to have
an opportunity to examine it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Ax-
thoky in the chair.) The paper will lie on
the table, if there be no objection.
Mr. FENTON subsequently said: I move
that the special finding, in the nature of a
memorial, of the grand jury of the southern
district of' New York, relative to the officers
of the Walkill National Bank and the Comp-
troller of the Currency, be referred to the
Committee on Finance.
