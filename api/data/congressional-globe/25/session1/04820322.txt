Making public officers depositories—Mr. Wise.
H. of Reps.
offer a safa ami convenient investment ofsmall sums to persons
whose situations and pursuits disable them from employing the
money profitably m any othermode It 13 not inore halne to be
lest when vested «1 the stock of a bank, thctn when it is loaned
to individuáis The interest on it is paid with mme punctuality,
' nd it can be sold and converted into cash, whenever the ownei
desires to employ it in some other way And if a larger poi
lion oí the metals 13 infused into the circulation, the business of
banking w ill become more sound and wholesome, and less liable
to the disasters from which it has suffered, under oui extrava
gantand ill organized system of paper issues It will íemhr
mve&taients m banking companies entirely safe and secure to
the holders, and afford them the almost absolute certainty of a
íeasonable profit, without endangering the capital invested
in it.
" For these reasons, it is neither practicable not desirable to
discountenance the continuance of the State banks They aie
convenient and useful also for the purposes of commerce í*o
commercial or manufacturing community could conduct its
business to any advantage, without a liberal system of credits,
and a facility oí obtaining money on loan when the exigencies
of their business may require it This cannot be obtained
without the aid of a paper circulation founded on credit It is,
therefore, not the interest of this country to put down the papea
cmroncy altogethei The great object should be to give it a
foundation on which it will safely ¡stand A cuculatmg medium
composed of paper, and gold, and silver, in just proportions
would not be liable to be constantly disordered by the acci ten
tal embmrassments or imprudences of tiade, noi by a coinhi
nation 01 the moneyed interest for political puiposet. The
value of the metals in circulation would remain the Bimo
whether there was a panic or not- and the pioportion of papei
being le <>, the credit of tha banks could not be &o readily in
paired 01 endangered "
What said Mr Woodbury m Becemhei of the yeai ? (See
the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury " On the piesuit
ayst* n of keeping and disbursing the public money > Decern
bei 12, 1S34 )
" With the causes of these last and most important faihncs
happening from time to time, as the table shows, to the veiy
Idtot year, this branch of our inquiry has no pa uculai concei n
except to discriminate them from others, and from any speci íl
connection with the system that prevailed fiom l&ll to 1810
Whether they arose Uom an unsound policy pursued by the
United Sutes líank, 01 from circumstances which, undei the
paper system, neither legislation nor caution can il ways av*. 11,
01 horn loss justifiable reasons, and m spite ol all the valutai>
influence the National Bank could exercise, it is a singular lac
in praise of this description of public debtois, the selected ban 1 ■ ,

which have ever stopped payment, fiom the establishment of
the Constitution to the piesent moment, a sum mm h bey >i d

that stopped payment m 1825 or 1826, and 01 whom ample
security was íequired and supposed to be taken undei the
responsibility of an oath

b)th dunna the existence of oui two national bank and whilt
neither of them existed have been almost entirely overioukid,

a hope that it will, in some degree, not only vindicate them horn
much unmerited censure, but justify this Department (or the
confidence it fonnerly, and, mtht git it imp tvement of then

lecently reposed in them "Under those encumstancts so vuy
