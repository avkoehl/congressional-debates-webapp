I have resided the past year at Alton, Ill., and I know the prisoners there were well treated, and I have no doubt they were at Rock Island. This article and comments are intended to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the Government, and I felt you would be glad to know of the same.

I am, respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,
