OFFICE OF THE SIGNAL OFFICER,

Washington, November 10, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The order of the Secretary of War requiring the annual report of the signal officer was received by me a few days since, on resuming the charge of my office in Washington, after some months" service in the field with the Army of the Potomac.

The period within which the report must be rendered will permit of a summary only. A report in detail will be prepared at this office, and, with accompanying documents, will be laid before the Secretary of War as soon as it can be completed.

The total number of officers detailed and under instructions as acting signal officers in the different military departments of the United States since the date of my last annual report (November 30, 1861) has been 199.

Department of South Carolina.............................. 15

Fortress Monroe, Va....................................... 10

Department of the Gulf.................................... 9

Yorktown, Va.............................................. 2

On special service, or awaiting orders.................... 16

REPORTS FROM DETACHMENTS.

The detachments of the corps with the armies in Virginia and Maryland, in North Carolina,in South Carolina, and in the Department of the Gulf have had the fortune to be with armies which have changed but little in organization. The reports from these detachments have been steadily favorable.

The detachments serving in the Valley of the Mississippi and in the departments west of the Alleghanies have kept their organization, and rendered such service as they could under great difficulties.

The forming and control of these parties was, of necessity, given to young officers of volunteers, themselves hurriedly instructed and
