long will it take to repair it? Lose no time in building stockades at every bridge. A stockade 30 feet square will hold about 30 men, which will be a sufficient guard for the less important bridges.

COLUMBIA, July 18, 1862.

General D. C. BUELL:

Trestle work at Duck River washed away; it is also reported that Franklin Bridge is gone. One of my citizens, come from Hickman, just in. Reports the arrival at Lick Creek of a considerable force of rebel cavalry from across Tennessee River; that they intend attacking this point. They obtained a supply of ammunition near New Spring Hill last night. Will send you further particulars.

Major General D. C. BUELL:

Upon personal examination I find railroad bridge less injured than represented by superintendent. One span perhaps beyond recovery. I shall keep a force at word all night removing the drift which the guards carelessly allowed to accumulate without notice until the span gave way. The Kentucky troops fight well, but cannot be depended upon for such duty if the bridges are to be guarded by them. You may expect surprise, &amp;c. I respectfully repeat the information sent some days since that if the bridges, road, &c., are not carefully and strongly guarded they will be destroyed.

General.

COLUMBIA, July 18, 1962.

Major-General BUELL:

No orders to build stockades on this line have been received. A determined effort to destroy bridges between this and Franklin last night. Success was prevented by a sudden change and re-enforcement of the guard at every bridge. Last evening the telegraph was cut, and parties of my men encountered about 30, who fled through a corn field. They are being purposed now. My scouts attacked beyond Mount Vernon yesterday 8 in number; returned to ---, and contended with enemy (40 strong) with heroic valor; required to surrender to a force of 12, and held their position until re-enforcement arrived. Three were slightly wounded.

Major-General BUELL:

Two cars of train from Reynolds' ran off the track 12 miles east, owing to the spikes being removed from a short piece of rail. One car had General Mitchel's and Captain Slocum's family in; the ladies slightly injured; Captain Slocum a serious scalp wound; 3 soldiers killed, 22 wounded; cars broken to pieces; road badly torn up for some distance.
