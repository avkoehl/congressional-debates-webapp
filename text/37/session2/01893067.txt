THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

and the confirmation of the Senate, he largely in-
creased the number of the several grades of officers,
and the result was that Congress passed an act in
1842 limiting' the number of the several grades.
The pay then of a captain, the highest pay in the
Navy, was raised from $1,920 to $3,572. The thing
wen ton in that way, until this complaint, of which
I speak, that the junior officers who did the work
and were really the right arm of the service, were
not paid enough, was brought before the attention
of Congress; and about two years ago the Naval
Committee took up the whole subject, prepared a
bill, and reported it to the Senate, raising the pay
of the junior officers, but leaving the captains as
they then were, on a very liberal pay. What took
placc? Just exactly what always will take place.
The Naval Committee were besieged; the wives
of the captains came to the Senate; they called
upon the members of the Naval Committee; they
addressed themselves and brought all the con-
siderations they could urge to the committee; and
finally the committee got the bill recommitted,
and then reported it back again, raising the pay
of captains from what it then was, up to what it
now is, to wit: that of senior flag officer, to $4,500,
and of captains, when commanding squadrons at
sea, to $5,000, and when on other service, §4,200.
In that way, the argument which had been used
to induce Congress to pass the bill, to wit: that
the junior officers were not well enough paid, had
the effect to raise the pay of captains, contrary to
the first opinion of the committee, up to what it
subsequently became and as it now stands, so that
the senior flag officer receives §4,500, and a captain
when commanding a squadron at sea receives
$5,000 a year.
Now, sir, in my humble judgment, when the
country is suffering as it is, and we are put to
such straits to raise money as we are, it is a bad
time to create at once, as you do by this bill, two
higher grades than that of captain, and rai.se the
pay of the highest officer, who is now a captain,
from $5,000, which is the highest sea pay that he
gets, to §5,718. I think that the best course for
the Navy is at this time not to ask for additional
pay for these high officers.
It may be said, and I have no doubt the Sen-
ator from Iowa will soy, for he lets nothing escape
his astute observation which he thinks he can
bring to bear on his propositions, that the aggre-
gate pay is not increased by his amendment; but
let me ask him, if it be so, is it wise to take away
from the junior officers of the Navy the pay which
they now receive for the purpose of swelling the
'amount which is to be paid to admirals? This
office of admiral, you may make more or less of
it, as you please, is really nothing but a title, a
title of honor, a title of distinction; and 1 am per-
fectly willing to confer it, if it will gratify the men
who have so nobly sustained the honor of the flag
and the interests of the country in the proud bot-
, ties in which they have illustrated their valor. I
am willing to give it, but let mc ask you, sir, in
your judgment, in the judgment of every observ-
ing mind, will it not detract something from the
value of the compliment that we are to bestow
upon these officers by the creation of the rank of
admiral, if we arc to couple with it additional pay?
I do not believe these gentlemen themselves ask
it; I do not believe they want it. I believe they
will be satisfied if you give them that which is
now the^highest pay that is allowed to any officer
in the Navy. The pay that the Senator proposes
to give to these admirals that you are going to
create, or to rear admirals as he would have them,
is a higher compensation than is paid to-day to
the rear admirals of the British navy. It is pro-
posed here at this time to create these officers, and
to confer upon them a higher salary than is paid
to officers of a like grade m the British navy, the
rear admirals, their pay being <£1,095, which be-
ing reduced to dollars and cents, is a very small
fraction over §5,300 per annum. You propose
now to put our admirals up above the commo-
dores of the first class, captains of the fleet, and
rear admirals, to bestow upon them at this time a
higher salary than is paid to either of these grades
in the British navy. I think it unwise and in-
judicious to make such an advance m their pay
at this time. If the amendment which I now pro-
pose shall be adopted, reducing the admirals from
05,718 to $5,000, I shall then offer some amend-
ments that will apportion the pay of the other
officers to correspond with that.
I hear it frequently said thatwc have done noth-
ing for the Navy. Sir, we have done something;
we have done a good deal; and we have done a
good deal to satisfy this demand for promotion.
What have we done ? A few years ago we created
by law a retiring board; they retired a great many
officers. Not satisfied with that,at the beginning
of this session of Congress we passed a retiring
bill which by one fell swoop cut off everybody
that had been forty-five years on the Register or
was sixty-two years old; and what do you sup-
pose the effect of it was ? Of a list of sixty-eight
captains it took forty-nine and put them on the re-
tired list. You have now to pay on yourretired
list, by the law of this session, about fifty captains,
which is considerably more than the whole num-
ber of captains we had no longer ago than 1830,
when we had but thirty-seven. Now we have
fifty on the retired list 
Mr. GRIMES. That is a mistake.
Mr. HALE. I have the Register here marked,
as I got it from the Department.
Mr. GRIMES. A great many of those fellows
have deserted the service.
Mr. HALE. That may be; but I understand
that there are forty-four captains'places to be filled
in consequence of that law.
Mr. GRIMES. Yes; buta great many ofthem
arc to supply desertions from the public service.
Mr. HALE. If they had not deserted they
would have been retired. The Register that I
have got from the Navy Department has a large
mark drawn against those to be retired for having
been forty-five years in the service. At any rate,
I think it did not leave twenty on the list of cap-
tains.
I know there is a great pressure to get this bill
passed, and to have a pay bill passed like that
proposed by the Senator from Iowa. The retiring
bill to which I have alluded was passed last De-
cember, and by it the Secretary of the Navy was
to fill the vacancies thereby created; but there has
not been a single appointment made. Not one of
the gentlemen who, under that law, passed six
months ago, was entitled to promotion has re-
ceived it; and what is the reason they have not
received it? Because the Navy Department have
withheld these promotions which ought to have
been made, and which the law six months ago
required to be made, for the pin pose of biinging
that state of things to bear on Congress to induce
us to pass this grade bill. I am willing to pass
the bill; I am willing to give these officers the
honors which they ask; but it will be seen that
by this bill we propose not only to create nine
admirals, (although they have only got twenty-
one admirals,in the whole British service on the
active list,) but we propose to create nine more
admirals and eighteen commodores to go on the
retired list. I think this unwise and injudicious.
I hope that the amendment which I have proposed
will prevail.
Mr. GRIMES, The Senator from New Hamp-
shire was very correct in saying that the gentle-
men who were connected with the Navy, or those
whom he supposes would be made admirals have
no expectation or desire, so far as I know, or at
any rate, have used no influence to secure an in-
crease of pay. He has made a good many state-
ments, however, inthecoursc ofhisargumentthat
are quite erroneous. In the first place, in regard
to admirals in the British service, the Senator will
permit me to say that there are exactly one hun-
dred admirals in the British service on the active
list, as will be seen by their Naval Register in my
hand. There is one admiral of the fleet; there are
twenty-one full admirals; there arc twenty-seven
vice admirals; seventeen lear admirals of the red;
seventeen rear admirals of the white, and seven-
teen rear admirals of the blue; making one hun-
dred, besides those on the reserve list.
Mr. HALE. I said twenty-one admirals.
Mr. GRIMES. But there arc one hundred ad-
mirals.
Mr. HALE. I do not see but twenty-one on
my book.
Mr. GRIMES. There are one hundred admi-
rals, graded as rear admirals, vice admirals, admi-
rals of the fleet, and these subdivided into admi-
rals of the blue, red, and white.
If the Senator had looked into the amendment a
little more closely, he would have discovered that
it diminishes the pay of the Navy, rather than in-
creases it. The aggregate saving to the Govern-
ment, if it should be adopted, would be $174,047
a year. That is shown by the following tables:

I will state very briefly how this amendment
was got up. In the first place we took the pay of
an ensign who under the bill has the relative rank
and position of a sccond lieutenant in the Army,
Now, take the Register, published annually by
order of the Government, and you will find that
the largest pay allowed to any second lieutenant
in the Army is $3,890; the lowest amount is
$1,448. We took the moan of these amounts and
tiie mean was $1,669. We had to take some posi-
tive absolute sum to start with in tlu> Navy, and
we fixed it at #1,200, instead of taking the amount
of $1,669, which is the pay of the Army. Then,
as we ascended in rank, we added twenty-five per
cent, to that. Thatis the sea pay. Then we deduct
twentypercent.ineach grade for the " other duty"
pay, and twenty per cent, from that for the leave
of absence pay, making it stand thus:
Sea pay. Other duty. &eave or
1 J J waiting oraeis.
Ensign $1,200 $930 $768
Master  1,500 1,200 960
Lieutenant  1,875 1,500 1,200
Lieutenant command-
in?  0.343 1,875 1,500
Commander  0,928 2,343 1,875

Commodore  4.575 3.660 2,928
Admiral  5,718 4,575 3,660
The officer in tiie Navy who corresponds with
a first lieutenant in the Army, under this bill, is
a master. The highest pay allowed to a first lieu-
tenant m the Army is $0,410, the lowest $1,448,
and the mean pay $1,929. The sum allowed un-
der this amendment would be, for sea pay $1,500,
for other duty pay $1,200; for leave of absence
pay $9G0, making the mean pay $1,220. Now
look at it. The mean pay of the officer of the
Army with a corresponding rank witli master is
$1,929, whereas we propose to give the Navy offi-
cer only $1,220. It will be understood that I show
now the comparison between the Army pay and
this proposed measure, and then I will ahow what
it is between the present pay bill of the Navy and
the amendment I have proposed, in a few mo-
ments.
The next rank is that of a captain. In my list
I did not include his commutation for fuel or quar-
ters or lights of any Army officer, which a Navy
officer does not get. The highestpay of acaptain
in the Army is $2,865; his lowest pay $1,622; and
the mean pay therefore is $2,244. The rank cor-
responding to that of captain in the Army is lieu-
tenant in the Navy. Under my proposition alieu-
tenant in the Navy, for sea duty, would get $1,875,
for other duty $1,500, for leave-of-absence pay
$1,200, making a mean of $1,525, instead of $2,244,
*Tlie numbei of " passed midshipman" or 44 ensigns" (as
now pioposed) varies, but as the number must always be
small, the slight mean average increase of their pay can-
not affect the aggregate pay materially.
