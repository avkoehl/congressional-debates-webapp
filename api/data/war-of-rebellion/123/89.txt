Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Last night I sent following telegram to Adjutant-General Thomas. Have received no answer:

General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington:

Regiments at Philadelphia ready to move under the late requisition of the President are not up to standard required by War Department, but are full under the militia law of Pennsylvania, in accordance with which our organizations of militia must be made. Let me you to recognize the organizations as they are.

A. G. CURTIN.

These regiments referred to consist of 2,000 men in four regiments. They refuse to consolidate, having always had a separate and distinct organization. They are uniformed and drilled and will prove effective soldiers. Will you accept them? They are ready to go. Do you require that all companies or regiments shall be to minimum standard of the United States, unless special authority is obtained for individual cases? I request an immediate answer, that the men may be informed of your conclusion.

A. G. CURTIN.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, May 27,1 862.

Your dispatch respecting raising volunteers according to the organization of the militia prescribed by the laws of Pennsylvania was duly received.
