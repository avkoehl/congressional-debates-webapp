HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,April 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General GREGG,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division, Warrenton, Va.:

The general commanding directs that you station a regiment from your command at Morrisville, to replace the regiment of General Kilpatrick's now there and which has been ordered to the vicinity of Grove Church. Direct the commanding officer to send out frequent scouts in the direction of Tackett's Mills.

There are numerous rebel scouts in the vicinity of Grove Church, United States Ford, Stafford Court-House, and Tackett's Mills. Major-General Meade is exceedingly anxious to have them driven from the country, killed, or captured, and directs the officer in command to be very vigilant, and to collect as much information as possible of the enemy. The regiment may be alternated at your pleasure, and will be supplied from depot.

C. ROSS SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,April 9, 1864.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:

COLONEL: To comply with the order to send a regiment to Morrisville will make it difficult to maintain the picket-line necessary to protect the camps of this division, separated as the brigades are. There are but four regiments in the brigade at Warrenton, not more than enough to hold the position if attacked. The other brigade camped between Warrenton and the Junction, but four regiments present. Can I not have relieved the detail of 100 men at Bealeton, as they will not be required when a regiment is at Morrisville?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.
