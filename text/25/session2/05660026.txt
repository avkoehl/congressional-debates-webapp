Mr. Calhoun's Resolutions—t¡r. Hubbard.
Senate,
paper cod pared Pith these resolution-, Why at-
tempt thus to m enee speech and the press without
the passage of a .aw? Let the same thing be done
by law, and then see whethei the people had be-
come so base as to permit these privileges to be
taken fiora them All the world could given as
less than chaff compared with the liberty of
speech
In this contest, Mr. M Knew well with whom
he h"11 to engage, he linen tin prejudices that weie
aga nst him, and that his best frunds would dmcr
lion him He had fully counted the cost, a d
had made up his mind to miel th s difficulties,
which c\ei urged him to etprtss hi   opinion'.
He desired the Señale to meet lus amendment
boldly and manfully, and it it «as wrong, íeject
it, but, n i was right, sustain it No objection
had been made to tne doctunes of the amendment,
but it was to be put down hy thi" imputation that it
was mterded to embairass The truth often em-
barrassed those who were in trroi, but this was
their misfortune, Ml M had no such design, but
it was tus endeator always faithiully to peiloim
his duty here and everywhere
Mr. M called foi the \eis <nd na}s on his
amendment, which weteordeied
Mr. HUBBARD remarked that he w.is not pie
paied to say that the adoption of these i< sul ttions
would have suth i diiect effect in ti mquili/iiii, the
public mind as was anticipated TIt would not
bay that any tim-i whim muid be doas heie, or
which could be done at the other end of this Capi-

whose leading paper declares that the Ab^luionists

not presume to uige the passage of these resolu-
tions on the ground tint an immediate favorable
effect will thereby be produced upon the master-
spirits of the Abolition party He could not eieu
hope fot such a consequence He too «ill knew me

solntums merely asserted ¿íeU and abstiai t tiuihs,
without proposing any practical and remedial mi i-
sure= He looked upon the resolutions with pecu-
liar favor from that very consideration It was
the general principles, the imp irtant abstractions,
embodied m the resolutions, which recommended
them to his favor The resolutions themselves,
and the vote of this Senate upon them, could not
fail to produce a powt rful influence in eventually
cor ecting, and in maintaining ecuect, popul ir opi-
nion upon th s agitauii-i sub, >o The public mind
w,ll be di etel to, aiilvill ittnti i! cumni,
the fundaren nial truths contained m 0 se ies< la-
tions, and n these political texts a.c four ded on the
Constitution—if they can be sustained by that-
•solemn compact, the Magna Charla of Ame-
rican liberty, then will public opinion be guid
ed and controlled Dy then benign influence,
then will error yield to the force oí truth, and pas-
s on be subdued by the power of reason Believ-
ing, as he most conscientiously did, that these re-
solutions were strictly compatible with the doc-
trines of the Constitution, and believing that now
was the fit, the accepted lime, to put forth these ab-
stract truths, to enlighten the public mind, and to
correct, and maintain correct, the public sentiment,
he anxiously wished then adoption He was well
aware, as he had before observed, that this battle
was to be fought m the non-slaveholdmg States
He therefore desired to keep the resolutions clear
of all objectionable matter, to have them assert
plainly and distinctly the truths which the mover
of the resolutions has so repeatedly declared it was
his object to promulgate And he, with the Sena-
tor from South Carolina, (Mr Calhoun,) deeply re-
gretted that the Senator from Indiana had presented
any proposition tending to embarrass the progress
of the oiigmal resolutions The proposition, of the
Senator from Indiana had no necessary connection
with thp resohitions, and yet he was not disposed,
here or elsewhere, to controvert thp positions
which he had asserted No man here, friendly to
the resolutions of the Senator ftom South Carolina,
would deny the tutth of those maxims selected
from the Declaration of American Independence,
and embodied in the amendment which had been
propesed. 1 ley \ieie familial to all, assented to
by all, and u the Senatoi from Indiana desired a
vote of the Senate upon bis íesolution, let him
bring it forwaul as an i i lep-ndenl proposition,
and he should have his vote tor it
He was as much in fa\ oi ol the fieedom of opi-
nion and ot speech, and oí the hbeity of the press
and ot the light of petition, as any raan on this
floor, and ue would go as ¡ ai a the Senatoi ftom
Indiana, or as any othei Senator, to maintain invi-
olate those rights 1 Ie was ready now, and at all
times b} his vote, to dtclaie 11 the fullest manner
his faith in the abstractions contained m the reso-
lution tf the Senatoi Irom Indian i He could not
but  „iet, also, that the Senator fiom Ohio
had censideied it neoissaiy t > bi ng forward his
pioposmoii tlu\> all s fined to lum to be out of
pi tie He was aw ue that the proposition of his
'ai nd lio u Ohio (Mi Allen) had been offered as
.in «unendnicn to the resolution of the Senator from
In liana, and would not h<\e been presented
to the Senate but a  an mde lendent proposition,
had not the Senator from Indiana urged upon
the Senate his pioposition for amendment. He
legrrtted the couise He Mas ready to meet
the resolutions of the Senator from South
Carolina, <n d to g ve i direct vote on each.
They had been brought foiwaid as independent
and as impiitant propositions, and they ought to
be me freely and fearlessly, and the vole oí the
Senate given unembarrassed by any extraneous
matter But the couise proposed by the Senator
from Indiana, and by the ¡senator fiom Ohio, (Mi
Moms,) was not new TI ey were both, he pie-
sumed, decidedly hostile to the measure, and this
was i hgitimile mode to <1< feat it When the re-
solutions which In had a few d iys since read to the
Senile wcie pendinf oeloie tin New Hampshire

ments Whin thi Niw Hiimpinne lesolutions to
which I have referred were undei consideration,
"Mr Easimav, of Conway, offered the follow-
ing as an amendment
"llesoljed, That eiror of opinion may be safely
tolerated so long as n ason is left fitc to combat it.
" Resolved, That th" dem ind m ide by the slave-
holding States upon the non slaveholdmg States of
this Union, for the latter 'to adopt penal enactments
foi the purpose ol suppressing any associations
\ iihm thi ii hmi's purpomv t0 ')(>> or having the
chn ile of, A ohiion sock íes,' is an unwar-
rantable inkrfciencc with the constitutional rights
of the citi/ens of said non-slaveholding States, and
cannot, therefore, be complied with
" Resolved, That any attempt to prevent free dis-
cussion on the subject ol slaver), by making use of
legal process, or by means of vio'ence, is not only
an abuse and contempt of law, but tyrannical and
unjust, and ought, therefore to be discountenanced
and rebuked by every Iricnd of our free institu-
tions "
" Mr Edwards offered the following resolutions,
to be added as an amendment
"Resolved, That the hbeity of speech and the
freedom of the press, rights secured by the Consti-
tution to citizens of this State, cannot be abridged
or restrained by penal enactments, on the request or
demand of any other State
" Resolved, That the claim of the Executive of
a slaveholdmg State on the Executive of a non-
slaveholdmg State, for the surrender of a free citi-
zen to be removed to such slaveholdmg State for
punishment undei laws to which he is not amena-
ble, for acts sanctioned by the laws of the State of
which he is a citizen, is an unwarrantable interfe-
rence with the rights of the free citizensof the a«w
slaveholdmg States."
Such were the amendments offered to the reso-
lutions which he had read in hi  place a few days
since, as having been adopted by the Legislature of
his State. They were offered to embarrass and to
defeat the original resolutions.
The fate of the proposed amendments is matter
of history. The Legislature, by a very decided
majority, passed the original resolutions; and yet
every member was ready to declare his belief m
most of the positions embraced m the amendments.
Such was the coursg ot proceeding there. The
propositions submitted by the Senator from In-
diana, and by the Senator from Ohio, (Mr Morns,)
had not then, to his mmd, even the merit of
novelty to recommend them But, as he had be-
fore said, it was a legitimate mode of attack; but
still he regretted that it had been re .orted to He
was, for one, ready and desirous to give a direct
vote on the resolutions of the Senator from South
Carolina, and he would assure the Senator from
Indiana that he would willingly give a vote in
favor of his resolution, if introduced a«¡ an inde-
pendent measure.
The Senatoi from Ohio expresses a deep solici-
tude for the preservation of this liberty of opinion
and of speech, tor the freedom of the piess, the
fieedom of publishing our opinions to the wotld,
unrestrained by any influence. He agreed to all
this, and he had yet to learn that any individual
member of the Senate was disposed, in any way or
in any manner, to infringe the liberty of speech,
or the freedom of the press. Certain he was, that
the Abolitionists themselves had no cause of com-
plaint. They had enjoyed, to their hearts'content,
the liberty of publishing to the world their opinions
and their doctrines He had that very morning
seen a paper, two or three columns of which were
occupied m giving the mere titles of the books and
pamphlets on the subject of slavery and Abolition-
ism, for sale at the office of the Anti-Slavery So-
ciety in New York He had looked over the list,
and to satisfy the honoiable Senatoi from Ohio that
there was no cause for hi* apprehension, that the
liberty ol the press was in no danger, he would, on
this occasion, give the titles of some ot the nume-
rous publications "Bound Volumes," "Anti-
Slavery Manual," "Ann-Slavery Record," " Ap-
peal," "Anhy Moore, the Slave, a spirited deli-
neation of the state of society m the slave States,"
" Biographical Sketches," " Baurnes';  Picture of
Slavery m the United States," " Cabinet of Free-
dom," "Channing on Slavery," "Charles Ball,
a story told by himself of a man who lived forty
years in Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia,
as a slave under various masters," " Dissertation
on Seivitude," " Enemies of the Constitution Dis-
covered," "George Thompson in America," "God-
win on SI ivery," " Granville Sharpe," " Gusta vus
Vasa, written by himself," " The Life of a Native
African, who was stolen out of his own land,"
"James Jackson," "L" ters on A menean Slavery,"
" Memoir of Lemuel Haynes," " Menoir of Phil-
lis Wheatley," " Negro Pew," " An inquiry con-
cerning the propriety of distinctions in the House
of God, on account of color," " Practical Treatise
on the Law of Slavery," " Slave's Friend," "Tes-
timony of God against Slavery," "Pamphlets,"
"Appeal to the Christian women of the South,"
" Appeal to the women of the nominally fiep
States, by the Anti-Slavery Convention .of Ameri-
can women," " Bible against Slavery "
lie would go no farther He would, however,
assure the Senate that he had read the titles of
but a very small portion of the publications now
for sale at the office of the American Anti-slavery
Societ) in New York He would venture to state
that, within the great republic of letters, there
could not be found so many publications upon any
other one subject as upon this agitating subject of
slavery He had merely adverted to the fact to
show to the honorable Senator from Ohio (Mr.
Morris) that there was no ground for his apprehen-
sions that the liberty of speech, and of the press,
were in no jeopardy.
He regretted to tee any movement m the free
States calculated to produce any agitatioia here up-
on this subject. If the men and women, whjo $e¿jl
