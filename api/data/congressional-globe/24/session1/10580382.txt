Defense of the Administration—Mr. French.
Ho. of Reps.
prepared to sav, that we ought to cast our censures
upon anybody, but rather to express our gratitude
for the blessings we enjoy. Sir, to show how
the trade and commerce of the United States have
flourished under General Jackson's administra-
tion, I beg leave to read a statement of the amonnt
of our imports and exports :

Mr. Chairman, my colleague attributes the
number of State banks and banking companies
to the influence of the General Government, or
rather to the opposition of the President to the
recharter of the Bank of the United States, and
indulges in the most gloomy anticipations of the
fatal effects of the paper system. 1 find, sir, up
to the first of January, 1835, there were five hun-
dred and fifty-eight banks, and one hundred and
forty-six branches, with a capital of $231,250,337.
"When we reflect upon the vast amount of capital
in the United States, the pervading wealth arising
from the agricultural, manufacturing, and com-
mercial prosperity of this whole country, I think
there is but little danger of the anticipated shock.
But, sir, ought the Executive to be censured for
the existing number of State banks? And does
not the censure of the Chief Magistrate equally
fall upon the people of the States, who, through
their Legislatures, have made the banks ? What,
«ir, is the fact? The President vetoed the bill to
recharter the Bank of the United States prior to
his reelection. The recharter of that institution
was made the great question before the people.
They decided at the polls against the bank, by
electing the President by a large majority. It
was literally a war between the Government of
the people and the bank. They wisely preferred
their Government. Had they desired it, they
could have procured its recharter by electing a
bank President and a bank Congress. The great
principle at the foundation of this Government is
that the people govern; as, then, the governing
power (the people) put down the bank, the cen-
sure cast upon the President falls equally upon
them in their sovereign capacity. I know my
colleague did not intend to censure the people;
but such is the effect of his argument. For one,
Mr. Chairman, I neither censure the President
nor the people. He has done his duty in having
faithfully executed the will of his constituents,
and the people of the States have a right to do
their own business in their own way and in their
own time. They have exercised that right; and
if they have made more local banks than in the
opinion of some they ought, it is not my prov-
ince to complain. But, sir, I must be allowed to
say, that the cause of civil liberty has much less
to apprehend from State banks than from the
Bank of the United States, had itbeenrechartered.
An effort is made on this floor, Mr. Chairman,
I will not say to get up another panic, but to
alarm the people with the idea that the public
money is unsafe in the deposit banks. 1 will
read to the committee an extract from a report of
the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress,
April 23,1816.    Speaking of the banks, he say s:
" Their whole liabilities and means, whether immediate or
otherwise, as compared with those a month previous, and
recently communicated to the Senate, appear in proportions
equally commendable and safe. Their means of all kinds
to meet their liabilities to the Treasury are over four dollars
to one; and to meet their liabilities of all kinds, except to
their stockholders, about one and a half dollars to one."
Sir, the Secretary, in exhibiting the ability of
the banks to meet all their liabilities, did right to
except the stockholders. They have in the de-
posit banks $43,690,980 28 of capital stock; and
the universal rule of law is, that all corporations,
or partners, have first to pay all debts owed by
the corporation, or partners, before they can get
their stock returned to themselves. If necessary
to pay their debts, the stock itself has to go; and!,
in «uch case, the loss (alls upon the partners.
From this report, there are $33,294,024 08 of the
public money deposited in them; $152,849,346 79
of means to pay that and all other debts of the
banks. The whole amount of liabilities upon
the banks, if you deduct, as I have already shown
ought to be, the capital of the stockholders, is
$109,158,366 51; and when the unexampled pros-
perity of the whole country is considered, every
branch of business flourishing, and the vast
amount of capital seeking its investment every-
where, I cannot bring myself to doubt about the
safety of the public Treasury, so far as the ability
of the banks are concerned. The fact of there
being in those banks but $10,885,996 92 of specie,
when the other means of the banks are taken into
the estimate, is not enough to spread the alarm.
The President is not only blamed for the number
of State banks now in being, but his laudable
efforts to introduce as far as practicable a metallic
currency are overlooked by those making the
complaint.. Sir, I present to the committee a
table from the mint of the United States, showing
the total coinage at (he mint from the year 1795
to the year 1835, inclusive. I find the whole sum
to be $61,816,658 48, of which $29,609,823 50
were coined during the seven years of General
Jackson's administration, and tnus lacking only
$2,597,003 08 of being as much as was coined
during the previous thirty-three years.    In the
Íears 1834 and 1835, including the months of
anuary, February, and March of the present
year, there were coined at the mint $5,967,525 of
gold.
Another of the censures cast upon the Admin-
istration is, that there is no law securing the
deposit of the public revenue, and rendering it
legally accountable to the Government. It is true,
sir, there is no such law; and why is it that there
is none? I answer, because Congress has not
passed it. I find, Mr. Chairman, that at the first
session of the Twenty-Third Congress, (the panic
session,) the majority of the Committee of Ways
and Means, to whom the subject had been referred
by their chairman, [Mr. Polk,] on the 4th of
March, 1834, reported several resolutions to the
House, viz:
1.  "Resolved, That the Bank of the United States ought
not to be rechartered.
2.  " Resolved, That the public deposits ought not to be
restored to the Bank of the United States.
3.  " Resolted, Thatthe Statebanks oughttobe continued
as the places of deposit of the public money, ai.d that it is
expedient for Congre-s to make further provision by law,
prescribing the mode of selection, the securities to be taken,
and the manner and terms on which they are to be em-
ployed ; and a fourth, recommending the appointment of a
select committee, to examine into the state and condition
of the banks of the United States."
These resolutions were all adopted by the
House, upon separate votes taken on each. The
minority of the same committee, by Mr. BinnBt,
on the same day, (4th of March, 1834,) made
their report to the House, which closes in the fol-
lowing words: "The minority are, upon the
' whole, of opinion, that none of the reasons as-
• signed by the Secretary in his communication to
' Congress are sufficient to justify the removal of
' the deposits. They are also of opinion, that it
' is-due to the bank to return them, without regard
• to the sentiment of the House upon the subject
' of recharter.    They are further of opinion, that
• the situation of the country requires immediate
' action by Congress, to restore public confidence,
' and to prevent a derangement of the currency.
' And they express to the House their settled con-
' viction, that these objects will not be attained if
' the pxtblic deposits are left in the State banks. They
• think, besides, that the universal voice of the
' country requires thaf something shall be imme-
«diately done for public relief, and that the reso-
• lutions proposed by the committee will only
' aggravate the existing evils, instead of producing
« a remedy." In pursuance of the third resolution,
a bill was reported to the House on the 22d of
April, 1834, by Mr. Polk, from the Committee
of Ways and Means, "regulating the deposit
of the money of the United States in certain local
banks," which finally passed the House on the
24th of June, and went to the Senate, from whence
it never returned. It is scarcely necessary to add,
that the friends of the Administration were for
the bill, and those in the Opposition against it.
The President, in his annual message delivered
to Congress at ths commencement of the last ses-
sion, recommended the regulation of the deposits
in the following words:
"The attention of Congress is earnestlv muted to the
regulation ot the deposit- in the State bank- by l,i\\. although
the power now excreted bv the executive" department in
thH behalf is only such as, was unitomily exerted through
every Administration, from the ongin ot the Govt rnnieut
up to the establishment of the prest nt bank ; jet it i  one
which is susceptible of regulation bv law, and therefore
ought so to be regulated. The power of Congress to direct
in what places the Treasurer shall keep the money- in the
Treasuiy, and to impose reductions upon the executive
autliontv in relation to their custody and removal, ¡- unlim-
ited, and its exercise will rather be courted than di-eour-
aged by those public officers and agents on whom rests the
responsibility lor their safety. It l- de-irable that as little
power as possible should be left to the President or Secre-
tary of the Treasury over those institution-, which, being
thus freed from executive influence, and without a common
head to direct their operations, would have neither the
temptation nor the ability to interfere in the political con-
flicts of the country. Not deriving their chaiters from the
national authorities, they would never have those induce-
ments to meddle m general elections which have led the
Bank of the United States to agitate and convulse the
country for upwards of two years."
The Committee of Ways and Means to whom
the subject had been referred, in conformity to
the recommendation of the President's message,
on the 16th of December, 1834, reported by Mr.
Polk, their chairman, another bill to the House,
" regulating the deposit of the money of the Uni-
ted States in certain local banks." This bill, it
being a short session, after much struggling by
the friends of the Administration to pass it, was
left with the unfinished business of the session.
And, sir, what the course of the Senate was, (a
majority of whom were opposed to the Admin-
istration on this subject,) I refer to the history of
the times to prove. It will be found, sir, on ex-
amination, that the party in that body in oppo-
sition to the Administration, as long as any rea-
sonable hope was entertained of rechartering the
Bank of the United States, kept that object
steadily in view, and labored to make the de-
posit question the instrument of its accomplish-
ment, whilst the friends of the Administration
were opposed to that course of policy. I have
given this brief account of the matter, Mr. Chair-
man, to show where the responsibility of a failure
to regulate the safe-keeping of the deposits by
law ought in justice to fall, and to vindicate the
Administration from the unwarranted imputation
of neglect on this important subject.
Mr. Chairman, my colleague, in addressing the
House, asked the question, " Can a single in-
stance be found where any one received an office
who did not belong to the party?" I will re-
mind him, sir, of the appointment of two post-
masters under this Administration in his own
county; and that he may know to whom I allude,
I will give their names, viz: Colonel Colby H.
Taylor and Captain James Pace.
Sir, it has ever been considered an act of justice
to select from the different States a due propor-
tion, at least, of the important appointments
within the gift of the Chief Magistrate. No
State, perhaps, in the Union—none, certainly,
considering its Federal numbers—has received at
the hands of this Administration a more liberal
observance of the rule than has the State of Ken-
tucky. I appeal in vain to previous Administra-
tions for an example of liberality comparable, in
point of numbers, to what is exhibited in the fol-
lowing list, viz:
1.  Thomas P. Moore, Minister to Colombia, commis-
sioned 13th March, 1829.
