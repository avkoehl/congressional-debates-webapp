25th Cong....3d Sess.
Party Politics—Mr. Pope.
Ho. of Reps.
tice, while eulogizing General Jackson and nul
Iification, might have bestowed on a distinguished
citizen of our State some little praise for it
Much is said about the increase and extrava-
gance of our public expenditures, but to what
extent this Administration is responsible I am
unable to form a clear and satisfactory opinion
That there have been m-^ny ímpiovidentexpend-
ltures is certain, and that many of these have
been voted for by a portion of both parties is
equally tiue During the present Congress at
least two million dollars have been appropriated
against my will and vote, and earned by a com-
bination of a pai t of the Whigs with a portion
of the friends of the Administration, and I there-
fore hesitate to rely on this as a substantial ground
of objection to the men in power My objections
are not so much to the amount of expenditure
as the manner of expenditme Has the money
collected from the people been fairly and care-
fully expended for their benefit' Public money,
honestly and fanly disoursed for necessary and
beneficial purposes, geneially benefits the poor
and laboring classes That there have been
many instances of improper expenditure, I have
no doubt, but so many have participated in them,
that I find it difficult to fix the blame exclusively
anywhere My impression is strong that the
Indian war might have been avoided, and the
sum of $10,000,000 saved to this Government, if
the advice of General Eaton, when Governor,
and others, had been followed The wai was
badly managed The expenses were increased
by drawing volunteers from the distant parts of
Missouri, and employing the northern Indians at
much expense, and without the least utility I
confess that I am not surprised at a consideiable
increase of our expenses They have grown,
and will grow, with the growth and wealth of
the country and the extension of our settlements
I repeat that my objections are to the manner of
expenditure I fear that we are plundered to a
great extent, from want of vigilance in the selec-
tion of officers and agents The good and suc-
cess of the party enter too much into the consid-
eration of the appointing power
"With regard to Executive patronage, about
which we have heard much, I have little to say,
because it must continue, to a great extent, so
long as the Consti'ution remains unaltered To
the Piesident the Constitution has assigned the
power of appointing all officers except s.uch of a
subordinate character as Congress may think
proper to confide to the heads of the Departments
How far the abuse of this power can be restrained
or regulated by law, I have not time to examine
The officers of the Treasury Department ought,
I think, to be rendered more independent of Ex-
ecutive dictation in the performance of official
duty, and the power of removals may possibly
be subjected by law to some salutary checks
The general power of appointment, the founders
of our Republic deemed it most wise and safe to
place where it is To remove a man fit and faith-
ful, without other cause than a difference of polit-
ical opinion, seems to be tyrannical, and good
behavior and fitness ought to be the guarantee for
his continuance in office. Whether this power
can be controlled by law or public opinion, is
matter of grave consideration When a new Pres-
ident is elected, and enters upon the duties of his
office, there would seem to be some strong polit-
ical consideiations in favor of the right of the
President to select the prominent executive offi-
cers, not only of the Cabinet, but throughout the
Union, on -whose fidelity and ability he must rely
for the execution of the laws, and the executive
administration of public affairs But, after he
has made his selection, and they have proved fit
and faithful, I would deem it an impeachable
offense to remove for expression of opinion Such
tyranny tends to make slaves and hypocrites, and
to break down that spirit of independence and
freedom of thought and action which belong to
the genius of our system The public officers and
the people should be told by the Chief Magistrate
that moral worth and fitness are paramount to
party merit This course is essentially necessary
to preserve that moral force in the nation, upon
which the durability of this Republic depends
I am satisfied that many defalcations and offi-
cial abuses have occurred, because the selections
have been made more with reference to the good
of the party than the good of the public Party
efficiency is estimated higher than integrity or
qualifications, and here I must be permitted to
say that I cannot admit the excuse for bad ap
pointments usually offered—that the President
and other executive officers have been deceived
He who is determined not to be imposed on, and
will be honest and vigilant in his inquiries, will
not be mistaken once in a thousand times Sn,
they are in most instances willing to be deceived,
if the good of the party is to be advanced lam
aware that theie are many useless offices and
agencies, adding to the pationage and influence
of the President, which ought to be abolished
There are, I am convinced, at least forty land
offices which might be dispensed with, forty re-
gisters and as many receivers, making eighty or
ninety in the whole, leceiving snlanes, besides
the contingent expenses of these forty offices, and,
if I should be honoied again with a seat heie, I
will avail myself of the fir t opportunity, when
there is the least prospect of success, to prune, if
possible, this branch of Executive patronage
There are, no doubt, othei offices and agencies
which ought to be piuned off
Mr   Chan man, the disposition  of the public
lands is another subject of deep interest lo the
people of the United States, to which the atten-
tion of this House and the nation has beencalltd
during the piesent session, on which the pames j
seem to be divided  here     The leading question
appears to be whether the proceeds shall be di
vided among the States, or brought into the na   I
tional Tieasuiy as part of our perrrnnent annual
levenue     1 he President and most of his fuends '
are against the dislnbution among the Slates  and
I mfei that my colleague goes with the Piesident
If I am  mistaken in regaid to the views of the |
Piesident on the questions to which I have nd
vei ted, and more especial! y about the public lands,
of such cardinal importance, I wish to be coi
rected    I desne to know whether his fuends in-
dorse his views     I can assure gentlemen that I
neither wish to misunderstand him or them, but
design to place the Adm initiation fanly befoie
the people     lie and his friends, with my eol
league, aie opposed to distribution
On this question I would, if piaeticable, tiead
in the footsteps of my old fi lend, President Jack-
son In one of his messages to Congress, he says
that after the payment of the public debt, we
ought no longer to look to the public lands as a
source of revenue, but to sell them to actual set-
tlers at a moderate price With this statesman-
like view I entirely concur, but the plan is not
practicable, neither my State, nor any of the old
States, will consent to it The next best plan is
that presented by Mr Clay's land bill, with a
little alteration I am for allowing a pieemption
to actual bona fiit settlers, at the Government
price, the pioceeds of the lands to be divided
among the States, to be applied, at least one half
to common schools, and the residue to internal
improvements, under the direction of the Legis-
latures of the States, the distribution to be made
according to the apportionment under the next
census The West will then have more than one
third of the Representatives of the nation, and
instead of the whole land fund being drawn from
the West, to be expended in other sections of the
Union, more than one thud will be retained m
that section to be expended there My colleague's
course is strange, passing strange, on this sub-
ject He complains that no public money is ex-
pended in Kentucky, while large expenditures are
made in other States, and yet supports the Pres-
ident in draining the West of $5,000,000 every
yeai, to be expended in other parts of the Union,
without giving Kentucky any poition of it The
estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury of the
annual proceeds of the public lands is $5,000,000,
the proportion to be received by Kentucky, Ten-
nessee, and Indiana, after the next census, will
be about the same, probably near two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars each, annually, Ohio
nearly double that sum, Illinois and Missouri
about one hundred and fifty or one hundred and
sixty thousand dollars each I do not pretend to
strict accuracy, but I feel assured that my calcu-
lation is substantially correct, so far as concerns
the argument in favor <rf distribution.    By this
airangement, the States will be enabled to diffuse
common schools for the benefit of the poor classes,
and improve loads, rivers, haibors, and other
works of internal improvement, without calling
on the General Government for aid And why
shall not this fund be divided in this way, by
which the expenditure in the interior will be equal-
ized ' Because the President, my colleague, and
others, say if you withhold the land fund, the
tariff may be raised My colleague admits that
Kentucky pays her full share of the tariff, with-
out any expenditure; and yet he is willing to
taiiffy the West by a dram of $5,000,000, without
retaining any portion foi the use of his own State.
While Mr Clay is fora general tariff, opeiating
on the whole, he is for dividing this fund so as
to give his own State $250,000 a year
I will beg leave to present the views of a con-
stituent of mine, a zealous fncnd of President
Jackson, and well known to my colleague,* a
man of strong undeistanding, bold and independ-
ent in the expression of his opinions, when wrong
he can never be put right, and when light can
never be changed On a public occasion he con-
tended that public land belonged to the people as
tenants in common, and if divided, a poor man
| would be entitled to as much as a rich man; that
if the pioceeds of the lands were applied to the
payment of revenue, oi to relieve the wealthy
from the payment of their shaie of the revenue,
it was a íobbery of the poor for the benefit of the
lich ile contended tint if a wealthy man paid
a tax of $100, and a poor man only five dolíais,
and the land fund was applied to pay or lessen
the taxes, then theiich man paying $100 would re-
ceive twenty times as mueh land as the poor man
who paid five dollars He insisted that the rev-
enue, accoidmg to the pnnciple and spiut of the
Constitution, oujit to be paid in proportion to
the pioperty or ability of each individual, and
that to make the land fund revenue was unequal
and unjust In this view there is much plausi-
bility and foice, and it is in conformity to the
plan adopted by the State of Georgia for the di-
vibion of their vacant lands 1 he President and
his fuends are for taking the fund belonging in
common to all, to relieve the consuméis of foreign
luxuries and finery fiom any additional burdens
The di bts charged on our public lands are paid,
and I concur with President Jackson that we
ought no longer to look to that source for revenue.
Accoidmg to my plan, the benefits of this fund
will be as nearly equalized as practicable, but
may be improved aftei further examination and
reflection
I cannot resume my seat, Mr Chairman, with-
out a slight notice of remaiks made on this floor
and elsewhere by gentlemen from the Old Domin-
ion Thev seem to make a national bank a test
question How long, I ask, has this been the
doctrine of Virginia' Many of the members from
Vugmiavoted for the bank in 1816, and weiere-
elected, and some were elected by the Legislature
to the Senate of the United States, after voting
foi the bank, unless I am very much mistaken
William H Crawford was chairman of the com
mittee in the Senate, m 1811, who reported a bill
to recharter the first bank, and made a very able
speech in support of the constitutionality and ex-
pediency of such an institution Yet Virginia
supported Mr Crawford for the Presidency, with
great zeal, against General Jackson, and Mr Van
Buren, the President, notwithstanding his uncom
promising hostility to the bank, was the right
bower of Mr Crawford in opposition to the Gen-
eral The course of Virginia towards Kentucky,
her first born, seems to be unnatural and ungrate-
ful Kentucky followed m the wake of Virginia
for thirty or forty years, supported all her dis-
tinguished men for the Presidency, and now,
when she presents for that office a man of the first
order, born and raised m the Old Dominion, they
turn their back on him because he entertains the
same opinion now which Mr Madison and many
other Virginians did m 1816, and tiansfer then
influence and votes to a citizen of New York I
could haidly consider a man's opinion about a
national bank, whether for or against it, an in-
vincible objection, provided he would follow the
advice of Mr Jefferson, that the President in a
