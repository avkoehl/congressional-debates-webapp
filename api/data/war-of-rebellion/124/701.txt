the district could be obtained in this way when it is taken consideration that the bulk of the people residing in this district do business in the city of New Your, and that their names were enrolled at their domiciles. The fallacy of the argument that many names are repeatedly enrolled must be apparent as regards the district of which I have charge.

That there are persons enrolled who are not liable to military duty there is no doubt; but before any specific instructions were received I adopted the principle that no injustice could be done to any person who was not liable, while if one person who was liable should escape that a great injustice would be suffered by every other person who was liable, my judgment being that those only who are liable are most interested in the faithful and impartial execution of the law.

The enrollment being thus completed, the next step was to consolidate the lists. This has been done according to the instructions laid down by the regulations of your department. These lists show the names of persons enrolled in each month (May and June), and after their completion they were careful compared with the original enrollment; then they were compared with each other, so that no duplications should occur; then, after the necessary alternations had been made, each name commencing with the same initial letter was compared with the same initial of every other sub-district, and I have the honor to state that with this test not a single name was found duplicated out of the ward in which the person had his residence.

After these lists had been thus perfected the slips containing the names of persons enrolled were prepared, and as each name was written it was checked upon the list containing it, and so in till all were written. The slips were prepared by sub-districts, and have been kept separate. After a sub-district was completed the names were again compared and counted, after which they were sealed up, and are now in readiness to be used. They have not, however, been enrolled, for the reason that some necessity may arise for their further verification.

Thus the business intrusted to my supervision has been accomplished, and I am confident that the enrollment is as complete as it is possible to make it, and that every precaution against error has been taken which was possible to devise.

I also submit the following as the complete and corrected number of persons enrolled of class 1 by sub-districts:

Sixth Ward............................................... 3,314

Eighth Ward.............................................. 908

Ninth Ward............................................... 2,600

Tenth Ward............................................... 3,373
