HEADQUARTERS SIXTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Pulaski, Tenn., January 29, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel R. W. SMITH:

COLONEL: General Johnson desires you to have a party of twenty men from your regiment made ready to go on a three days' scout, starting late in the afternoon on Monday. They will be placed in charge of an officer or non-commissioned officer of energy, vigilance, and first-rate capacity generally. As an officer is to go in command of a party from the Eighth Michigan, which will co-operate with them, it is not very important that you should place an officer in command, though it is desirable, if you have a first-rate one. Let the officer or non-commissioned officer who goes report here at 9 a. m. to-morrow for instructions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
