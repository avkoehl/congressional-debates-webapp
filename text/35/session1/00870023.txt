question to be put, the cffect will be to bring up
tills question to-morrow as the unfinished busi-
ness of the morning hour.
The SPEAKER. That is the understanding
of the Chair.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I will inquire
whether it has not been the practice of the House,
when the main question is not ordered to be put,
to proceed with the disposal of that question ?
The SPEAKER. The Chair is not aware of
such a practice.
Mr. CLINGMAN. Under our practice, the
refusal to order the main question brings up the
matter before the House next morning, when the
question again recurs, " Shall the mam question
be now put
Mr. STANTON. If the main question be not
ordered, will not the House be in a condition to
proceed to discuss or vote upon the propositions
before it?
TheSPEAKER. In that case, the proposition,
by the usages of parliamentary law, passes from
the House to again come up to-morrow morning.
Mr. STANTON. "Will it not he in order to
disruss it ^
The SPEAKER. It-will not. The previous
question has been seconded.

House, whether, if the proposition of my col-
league be voted down, the House will not be
brought at once to a vote upon the resolutions

j So the resolutions were agreed to.
j Pending the call of the roll—
| Mr. AVERY said: I was not -within the bar
i when my name was callcd, and I am not certain
| whether I came in before the next name was
: called. I ask the privilege of recording my vote.
Mr. RITCHIE. I must object. I objected
this morning to the same privilege being accorded
to one of my colleagues.
Mr. CURTIS. I was not within the bar when
; my name was called, but I ask permission to
vote.
Several Members objected.
Mr. CCJRTIS. I should have voted in the neg-
ative.
Mr. HATCH. I was not within the bar when
my name was called, but I desire to say that if I
had been, I should have voted in the affirmative.
Mr. HOUSTON moved to reconsider the vote
by which the resolutions were adopted; and also
moved to lay the motion to reconsider upon the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. EOCOCK. I nominate for Printer of the
House, James R Steadman, of the State of Ohio.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I nominate
George M. "Weston, of the District of Columbia.
The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Boco£k,
"Washburnt of Maine, Zollicoffer, and Huy-
ler, tellers to count the votes.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I believe that in
elections of this kind members can vote at any
time before Lite result is announced. They differ
from votes by yeas and nays m this respect.
The SPEAKER. That has been the practice
of the House.
The House, in the execution of its order, then

sary to a choice, 108; of which—
