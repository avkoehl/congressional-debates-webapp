JUNE 17, 1864.

General MEADE:

Major Roebling communicated to General Humphreys all the results of his examinations. He was across the railroad at the bridge over the Blackwater River, and there was no enemy south of it. There is nothing visible along the railroad for a mile northwest of the bridge. Here the road curves and farther view is obstructed. It is impossible to tell what force the enemy is in, but he presents a continual line all the way to the Blackwater Swamp. Roebling will go on a further reconnaissance with my cavalry escort.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 17, 1864.

Some prisoners just sent in say that General Burnside's troops are over the works. They say that we can easily capture Petersburg if we push right ahead.

General WARREN:

If Burnside has gained any great success which can be followed up I desire you to move forward with your whole corps. I have no report from Burnside, but only a message from Lieutenant-Colonel Locke, your assistant adjutant-general.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
