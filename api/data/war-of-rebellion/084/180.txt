There is some danger of a force of rebels being pursued in Missouri, trying to escape by crossing the river, possibly, at Atchison; see that you have the ferry-boat prepared against surprise. Let it be on the west side of the river at night and well guarded by day. The rebs were at Camden Point to-day.
