FORT SCOTT, KANS., May 8, 1865.

Major General J. G. BLUNT,

Fort Smith:

Your headquarters started from here the 3rd instant. Captain Hampton is at the court-martial at Leavenworth. Governor Crawford is expected here daily, and is said to be going down to you. Have not heard myself from him. Have heard nothing of your family. Is the Fourteenth ordered to your command?

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.

FORT SMITH, May 8, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General C. W. BLAIR:

Order Companies M and L, Fifth Kansas, to report to me at Fort Gibson immediately.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., May 8, 1865.

Captain JOHN PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Leavenworth:

General Blunt orders me by telegraph to send the Fifteenth Kansas Cavalry, Companies M and L, Fifth Kansas Cavalry, and the First Colorado Battery to Fort Gibson without delay to report to him. As I suppose the order directing me to report to Brigadier-General Mitchell detaches me from Major-General Blunt's command, I await General Mitchell's instructions on the subject. I would like also to know the exact status of my command. If the old District of South Kansas is taken from General Blunt's command, is its official designation abolished; and what is the official designation of my command?

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 8, 1865.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR:

You will not send the troops mentioned to Fort Gibson without orders from these or department headquarters. The order assigning you to the command is not very explicit as to geographical limits. The country comprised in the District of South Kansas still retains its former designation and is under your command, excepting Lawrence. Efforts are being made for the issuing of orders that will prevent confusion in this matter.

By order of General Mitchell:

JOHN PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
