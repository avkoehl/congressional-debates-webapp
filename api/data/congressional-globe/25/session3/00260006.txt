THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

of their occasional mismanagement, I have yet

nel, the othei mteiests of the community To the
Geneial Goveimnent they piesent themselves
meiely as, State institutions, having no necessary
connection with its legislation or its administra-
tion Like other State establishments, they may
be used 01 not in conducting the affairs of the
Government, as public policy and the general in-
terests o*" the Union may seem to require The
only safe or piopei principle upon which their
mtei course with the Government can be regulated,
is that which regulates their intercourse with the
private citizt n—theconfemng of mutual benefits
When the Government can accomplish a financial
opaiation better with tlit aid of the banks thin
without, it should be at hbtity to seik that aid
as it would the seivices of a private bank( r, 01
othf i capitalists or igents, giving the picfeience

Our expt nenoo tinder tht ai t passed at the last
session, to gi mt pn etnption lights (osetthis on
the public land' , has as yet bet n too limited to
enable us to piotiounee Willi safttj upon the ef-
ficacy of it  provisions to eany out the wise and
liberal policy of the Oovtuimi nt in that ¡espi ct
Theie is, howiver, the bes' it asm to mti ipate

mendations foi mtrly submitted to you,in i esprit
to a giaduation of the pnee of tin public I mils,
remain to be finally acted upon Having found
no reason to change the views then expressed,
your attention to them is again respectfully le
quested
Eveiy piopei exeition his been made,and will
be continued, to eairy out the wishes of Congress
jn i elation ti tin tobacco tiade, as indicated in the
several lesolutions of the House of Representa
Uves and the legislation of the two blanches A
favorable impieoSion has, I trust, been mede in
the diffeientfoieign countiies to which pirticulai
attention has been directed, and although we i an-
not hope foi an early change ¡n their policy, as m
many uf them a convenient and large revenue is
derived from monopolies in the fabrication and
sale of this article, yet as these monopolies are
really mjui ions to the people where they are estab-
lished, and the revenue derived fiom them may
be less injuriously and with equal facility obtained
from another and a hbeial system of admimstia-
tion, we cannotdoubtthat our efforts will beevent-
ually crowned with success, if persisted in with
temperate firmness, and sustained by piudent
legislation
In recommending to Congress the adoption of
the necessary provisions at this session for taking
the next census, or enumeration of the inhabitants
of the United States, the suggestion piesents itself
whether the scope of the measure might not be
usefully extended, by causing it to embrace au-
thentic statistical returns of the great interests
specially intuisted to, 01 necessarily affected by,
the legislation of Congrtss
The aeeompinytng repoit of the Secretary of
War piesents a satisfactoiy account of the state
of the Army, and of the several blanches of the
public si iviee confided to the superintendence of
thit officer

it aft nds mi smci re pleasuie to be able to ap-
piise you of the r-n'iri lemoval of the Cherokee
nation of Indians to then new homes west of the
Mississippi The measures autbonzed by Con-
gii ss at Us last session, with a view to the long
standing controversy with them, have had the
happiest efficts Byanagieementconcluded with
then) by the commandinggeneial m thitcountry,
vv ho has peifoimed the duties assigned to him on
the o_e«tsion with commendable eneigyand hu
inanity, their it movil has bien pi moip illy under
the conduct of then own chiefs, and they have
i mi'iattd without any apparent íeluctance
Th successful accomplishment of thisimpoit-
ant object, the lemoval, also, of the entile Cieek
nation, with the exception of a snull number of
fugitives amongst the Seminole  in Florida, the
piogiess aheadymade towauls a speedy comple-
tion of the removal of the Chickas iv/s, the Choc
taws, the Pottawatonnes, the Ottawas, and the
Cluppewis, with the extensive puichases of In-
di m linds duung the prebcnt yeai, have ren
dei ed the speedy and successful result of the long
estaobshed policy of the Government upon the
subject of Indian affaus entirely certain The oc-
casion is, therefoie, deemed a pioperone to place
this policy in such a point of view as will exon-
erate the Government of the United States fiom
the undeserved reproach which has been cast
upon it through several successive Administra
tions. That a mixed occupancy of the same ter-
ritory by the white and red man is incompatible
with the safety 01 happiness of either, is a posi-
tion in respect to which there has long since
ceased to be room for a difference of opinion
Reason and expenence have alike demonstrated
its impiacticability The btttei fiuits of eveiy
attempt heietofore to oveicome the barriers inter-
posed by nature have only been destruction, both
physical and moial, to the Indian, dangerous
conflicts of authority between the Federal and
State Goveinments, and detnmental to the indi-
vidual piospenty of the citizen, as well as to the
gieat improvement of the country The reme-
dial policy, the pnnciples of which were settled
more than thirty years ago, under the adminis-
tration of Mr Jefferson, consists m an extinc-
tion,for a fairconsideration, of the title to all the
lands still occupied by the Indians within the
States and Territories of the United States, their
removal to a country west of tjie Mississippi,
much more extensive, and betteradapted to their
condition, than that on which they then resided;
the guarantee to them, by the United States, of
their exclusive possession of that country forever,
exempt fiom all intiusions by white men, with
ample provisions foi their security against exter-
nal violence and internal dissensions, and the
extension to them of suitable facilities for their
advancement in civilization This has not been
the policy of pai ticular Admmisti ations only, but
of each in sueiession since the fiist attempt to
carry it out undei that of Mi Monroe Allinve
laboitd foi its accomplishment, only with differ-
ent degrees of success The manner of its exe-
cution has, it is true, from timé to time, given use
to conflicts of opinion and unjust imputations,
but in lespect to the wisdom and necessity of the
policy itself, thete has not, fiom the bpginiimg,
existed a doubt m the mind of any calm, judi-
cious, dismteiestpd f'lend of the Indian íace,
accustomed to reflection and enlightened by expe-
nence
Occupying the double character of contractor
on its own account, and guaidian for the paities
contiacted with, it was hardly to be expected that
the dealings of the Federal Government with the
Indisn tribes would eseajie misiepiesentation
I bal theieoccuncd,in the eaily settlement of this
conntty, as in all others where the civilized íace
has succf eded to the possessions of tne savage,
i istames of oppression and tiaud on the part of
the foimer, there is too much reason to believe
No such offenses can, however, be justly charged
upon this Government since it became free to
puisne its own course its dealings with the
Indian tubes hue beenjustand fnendly through-
out, its efforts foi their civilization constant, and
directed by the best feelings of humanity, its
watchfulness m pioteeting them from individual
fiauds min muting, its foibeaiance undei the
keenest piovocations, the deepest mjuties, and
the most ilagrantoutiages, may challenge, at le ist,
a companson with any nation,ancient oi modem,
in similai cucumstancps and if in future times
a poweiful, civilized, and happy nation of Indians
shall be found to exist within the limns of this
noithein continent, it will be owing to the con-
summation of that policy which has been so un-
justly assailed Only a veiy brief reference to
facts in cunfiimation of this assertion can in this
form be given, and you aie, theiefore,necessan'y
| refened to the lepoit of the Secretaiy of Wir
, foi furthei details To the Cherokee , whose
case has, peihaps, excited the gieattst shaie of
attention and sympathy, the United States have

| elusive and peaceable possession, thirteen million
five hundred and fifty four thousand onehunditd
and thnty five acres of land, on the west side of
the Mississippi, eligibly situated, in a healthy
climate, and in all respects better suited to then
condition than the country they have left, in ex-
change for only nine million four handled and
ninety two thousand one hundred and ¡sixty acies
on the east side of the same river The United
States have, m addition, stipulated to pay them
$5,600,000 for their mtei est in and impiovements
