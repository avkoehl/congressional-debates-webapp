Brigadier-General FISK:

Colonel Howland, of Sixty-ninth Enrolled Missouri Militia, is here to-day, having failed to receive Colonel Hayward's orders of the 10th to hurry forward men to Macon. He returned at once. Colonel Graham telegraphs he will have sixty mounted men at Macon do-day. Several scouting parties out after straggling guerrillas. Captain Thatcher killed the leader of one band, Jack Young, and we have one of his men here, who has confessed. Are after the balance of the gang. No news of importance.
