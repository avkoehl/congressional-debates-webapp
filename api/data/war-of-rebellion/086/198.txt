creek called Palo Duro, some 200 miles in a northeasterly direction from the mouth of Ute Creek, on the Canadian or Colorado River, east of Fort Union, N. Mex. This would make them about,say, 200 miles south of Fort Larned or southwardly from that post. I shall, within ten days, send a force of 300 volunteer troops, 200 mounted and 100 on foot, with two mountain howitzers, and, say, 100 Ute Apache Indians, i. e., 400 in all, under Colonel Christopher Carson, to attack the Kiowas and Comanches. This force will move down the Colorado to within northwest toward the States, which road is said to come into the Arkansas from the southwest near the mouth of Walnut Creek. I hope you may be able to time your movements so as to reach the Indians on the Palo Duro, or near there, at the same moment with Colonel Carson, so that a blow may be struck which those two treacherous tribes will remember. I will send a copy of this latter to Colonel Carson.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

NOTE.-I inclose herewith a copy of General Orders, Numbers 32, current series, from these headquarters.
