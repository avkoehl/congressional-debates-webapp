Pulaski:

Have you any scouts toward Lawrenceburg? I wish you to look well in that direction also with cavalry. Keep Hood at Florence until Sunday and you will be all right, as Schofield's corps will be up at that time. I have heard from Croxton up to yesterday p. m. He reports the enemy still at Florence fortifying.

Colonel Sipes, from Columbia, reports the rebels picketing the roads about Lawrenceburg, and citizens report to Hatch's scouts that the advance of Forrest's force is at that point. I have just sent one of Hatch's regiment to ascertain the facts. Whitaker arrived with two brigades this morning. The boats I sent for are much needed. I will report further this evening.
