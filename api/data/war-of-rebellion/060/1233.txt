HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, March 19, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. IMBODEN, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The man Langley mentioned in your letter of the 11th instant came to me recommended by Major Gilmor, but I do not know how far he deserves confidence. I understood that he had a permit to go in and out of the lines of the enemy as agent of a Northern newspaper to obtain copies of our papers. He is not employed by General Hill or General Stuart, but was directed to communicate any intelligence he might have to the latter in writing. While General Early was in the valley I directed that Langley should not be permitted to leave the lower end of it to come within our lines, and that he should be arrested if he did so. I desire that you will observe the same directions. It will not prevent him from being useful if he wishes, and will prevent him from doing us harm. Of Manzy I know nothing, and you will deal with him as prudence may dictate.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
