(Received a.m. 20th.)

Brigadier General WILLIAM W. AVERELL,Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that if you can that you employ loyal citizens of Williamsport and vicinity to give you information in the case of an advance or attempt on the part of the enemy to cross the Potomac.
