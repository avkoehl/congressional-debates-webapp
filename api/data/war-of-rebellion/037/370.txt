Number 85. Report of Brigadier General Louis. Hebert, c. S. Army, commanding Brigade. HEADQUARTERS HEBERTS' BRIGADE. May 21, 1863.

MAJOR: I have the honor to report, as far as can be ascertained, the effect of top-days' engagement on the line of my brigade. Soon after daylight, the enemy opened their batteries and line of sharpshooters, and kept up their fire with rapidity and serous effect during the day, to dark, even since an occasional shot is fired from one of their batteries. Besides undergoing the fire on my brigade front, one of extreme NIGHT HAS SUFFERED FROM THE sharpshooters on the left of Brigadier-General Moore, and very severely from a battery in front of Brigadier-General Moore. This battery has been very effective against my headquarters.

The enemy's sharpshooters are in close proximity, and the batteries have injured much of our parapets. The two 20-pounder Parrots remaining on my line have bee dismounted, and are unserviceable. One
