26th Cong.-.-.2nd Sess.                                   Treasu y Note Bill—Mr. Davis.                                                       H- of Reps.
appropriations exceed the published estímale',
but these private, informal ones induce the addi
Uonal supply, and thus the whole responsibility of
it is thrown upon CoDgreas, wben th« larger thaie
ought to res' upon the Executive I have no
doubt that this deceptive, stealthy mode of obtain-
ing appropriations has been often adopted to heave
the responsibility from tne shoulders of the Presi-
dent. Besides, such, communications evading this
House through the medium of tne Speaker, ¿nd
seeking the chairman ot the Comm ties cf Ways
and Means directly, seem to claim a confidential,
semi-official relationship between him and the
Executive branch of the Government, aga nst
which 1 make my solemn protest He is not, nor
is the chairman of any of tne committees of this
House, an Executive functionary or sgent All
are the organs ot this Hou e, belong absolutely
and exclusively to it,and are subject whelly to its
expressed «ill, and any formal and official com-
munications between the Executive D^partmert
and these chairmen are innovationary and impro-
per. Information omc ally communicated, and
designed to infiasnce our action, ougnt to reach
us through the Speaker. I trust, whenever O neial
Harrison's administration maj desire money to be
voted for any purpose c f Government, that <i
frank, honest, old fashioned communication, ex-
press ng precisely its object, will be addre«s d to
the Speaker of ihe Hou e cf Represent ilives, =o
that the nation mzy know and understand it But
this eitimate of appiijirntions f r the Florida war
is to ftay and supply tro ps th-u have been already
mustered into the service of the United States by
the President for terms uf three months The
Secretaiy of War informs us that one of thu. terms
has expired, and that tbry have been, sometime
since, enrol'ed for another, and he proposes to
enlarge their number fiom 1,5' 0 to 2 000 From
his statemen', more than a million ot this money
must now be due, ind by the t nnination of this
Administration halt m much moit must become
payable
Is it not, then, a bold and lecKless disregard of
duty for the Secretary to neglect, and the chairman
of the Commmee of Wayv and Means to reiu-e, to
provide any supplies to meet these Florida e tí-
males? It is ttue that these expcnditurei have
grown out ot the employment ot what the h°ad of
the War Depirtmeni caiK tlw "sedentary militia,"
and that, by the terms of their emolment, they a e
not to be embodied, but by general order are
directed to pursue actively their ordinary business,
anl have exprcsly ^ipuhtcd ih t they a <t, under
no circumstances, to be mart bed twenty m lea horn
their residence This foro has been cr>ated by
the extraordinary power of ihs President, and his
war Store taiy witnout due:nin¿t> consult C In-
gres , but bican e they abused, < i were unequal to
their official discretion, an I have co istttuted a I uge
corps in a fot in not only inefficient, but ludierous
and ndiculous, still the cost is a debt, aid as
such, good faith and the public credit rcquue it to
be met
But there will be still other large claims upon
the Treasury above and without the estimates of
the Secretary      He (omputes that ti e sum ne-
cessary for pensions will be something upwards of
half a million of dolíais lc>,s thin was n quired for
tne past year, to produce  when, result  the poor I
persionets would have to die at a late exeee nig

Evans] has shown that  10 per cuit  pir annum I

p'lgbted filth of me Government to tatse re-ipients

Neither has the Sccctary estimated  ore f?rtt ng
to  satisfy  the  claim     ot  ti-e Slates against ihe
General Government, or o , a/ private claims, or
to cover objects which, amidst such a va t van *y,
might eicape  bis  -mention,   oi   lha  neceas ty for
which might vis>e  diirin   'h' s ;, i ,n      Mai"e ha^
claims, ouginatmg nut ri h r mnntey movements
to repel  Bnti'h   a gression   uion   her  territory,
amounting to between two and three nundred thou-
san I dollars,  and New Hamoshire and Geoigia
both have their claims    A bill providing for the
payment of those oí New Hampshire has passed
the Senate, and the House Committee on Military
Affairs are prepared to r port unsn mously m favor
of those of Mame Now I demand to know of
the gentleman representing those two Sla'es, how
they can urge or vote for the payment of the claims
of then respective S at<-s, whilst they stand opposed
to rai°e enough oí supplies to meet them, and to
pay for the other necessary public service? It is
neither just, patno'ic, n"r decorous I have not
been so much surprised at the coid neglect with
wh eh the private claimants have been ireated
Durirg the last «e^sion all their demands, just or
unjust, were sjstemattcaily and peis vcrmgly op-
pjscd by this Administration and us majority in
both Houses of Coiures , and so successfully has
this hostility b>en followe ! u?, tbat I do not be-
lieve a dozen private bills will have passed by the
4th of March M=ny of th^m are cf the most ju-4
and meritorious character, and some of the indivi-
dual  o whom tbfy 're dje have been hang ng
around tins Hall until tney hs>ve grown old From
year to yeat, they have been sustained by the
crnsciousnesi of ihe justice of then e'emands, and
by th  bright and glorious but receding illusions of
an American Congress, impres ed upon tl em by
the lessons ot their jouth. They have been
taught to connect it with the loftiest concepmn^ ot
ability, intelligence, virtue, justice, decorum,
dignity, and business aptitudes But they have
seen it gradually linking into degei eracy, rent
anl lorn by contending parties passively register-
ing Executive edicts abandi mi g ils constitutional
and appropriate d tic-,, and gu in r it elf up whollv
to cabals io control a Ph s (teriini ele< tiun, trirn-
plmg upon the Ccnitituue n discarding the pub-
lic good, ind con em rung the claims of priva e
justice. When these individual have seen our
debates running into niterminaele vegan's on
every swbject but th  one btfore the Hou<.e, and
the days allotted by our rules to an adjnd.catton of
Iheirrights hlcned from them b> an unsciupulous
and tyrannical majonty ind that ture and money
which justly belongs to iheii given up to fac'ioa
and profi gacy, who could be surprised that they
s íould inter against us cur cs deep and bitter,
that, smar'ing under a sense ot slight and wrong,
they should invoke -eome Cromwell to drive us
from the  eats we dishonor?
I submit it to the mtell gence and candor of the
honorable chairman whether fot 'be ap r< prialions
to cover ihe e el'ims of the States, the demands
ot individuals that ought reascnably to be pressed,
and subjects that miy have escaped the attentnn
of the Si denary of the Treasury, or that may be
provided í >r by the independent action of Congress,
tne sum ot one million of dollars would be too
large? Why, sir, it there should be an ord nary
degree of vigilance and fidelity in supermten lin.*
the piib'ie, crvice, that amount nould be greatly
iusifficient In 1838 the ej.pendit.res exceeded
the e^mndte-, nure than four mil ions of do lar«, in
1839 ihi* evrc s was fc>l 360,578, and m 1840 it
w^a ¡J2 7,23 349, and in each year th excess w?s
composed principally of items that had been
omitted by th" Secretary in his estimates These
facts, wnh a great rnpny others, piove how prone
to error i> ihe head of the Treasury Department,
and adiiomsh my honorable friend to abate some
tbmg ot th  high confidence which be is disposed
to sivc to hi  es mi! e-, for the pre-ent year. But
conoid ng fi r tne nre-ent th-?t they ave accurate so
fjr as they go—and sti 1 it i  dernoishattil t ■■at
they are minus by mil'inns, cfrtam'y rot less than
by the difference b twecn hs e t ma'e-d surplus
and the eg rega'e ot he several ltem^ which Í hrve
I ere pte nteil, Mil this diffc ence cannot possibly
be less tnai ^4 564 31 b—now can the (barman
of the Committee of Ways it i Means e r Lon-
aiess evade the duty to raise the requisite supplies
to meet n?
But 1 t us examine very cursorily the adequacy
of the rrovision which ihe minister of finance pro
j oses ( r the jear's sei\ e< He estimates a ¡ess
expe ill lire for ihis >ea i an whit was actu?lly
incurred duntg the last bv §3 33J 349, and if tre
items connected with th Florida war, which had
actually accrued, and w re then in arrears, be, as
they ought to be, computed, this excels of expendi-
tures for last year would be more than $4,000,000
Tne diffhence between the expenses of the short
and long sessions of Coogifs, and the diminished
sums neces ary for the public bnildino«, and to ex-
ecute Indian tieaties, madr in the aggregate, m
fa-e or of this year, about §500,000, but m addition
to tne $250 000 which mil te requned for the pay-
ment ef pension , there are other large amounts
which the Secretary has cut down m his estimate*,
and, as it seems tome, to the prtjudice of the pub-
lic interest Last ye-ar tbere was appropriated for
the Ordnance Department $963,000, this year but
$766,000 In 1840, the appropriations for fortifi-
ciuons were $878,198, whilst for 1841 the Secre-
tary e tima es $415,500 for the «ame woilcs As
they are al1 in in unfinished state, and more money
must be experded on each befire they are ecrn-
p'e ed, ihe rep^o lable presumption is, that as large
expenditures v ou d have bpen required upon them
in this, as during ihe past yerr But then the
S cret^rv of Wai informs us that, m consequence
of these appropnatu ns for the past year having;
been postponed by the President, little or nothing
of them bad been expended, there is an apparent
necessity for enlarged operations, and sums ex-
ceeding tho e which were voted at the last session.
This difererce beiween tfre appropriations of
tne past, and the estimates of the present year,
m ght be tiaced, but in a less striking degree, in a
great many other items Bat let me pursue, for a
moment, this suspension or postponement (if the
term suits better) by the President of certain appro-
priations made at the last sess on In bis annual
'nessr-ge h* u^ea this larguag;- "Nor has it been
f und necessary, in order to pioduce tlvs result,
to resort to the power conferred bv Congress, of
pistponing certain clashes of the public works, ex-
cept by deferring expendí ures for a short period,
upon a limned portion of them, and which post-
ponement terminated some time smce," &c. From
ne President's statement, every person would infer
that this po tponement had produced but an incon-
siderable interruption to operations on these work ,
and which slight as it was, had long since wholly
ce?s d But wha' is the information given us by
the Secretary of War upon this subject? In his
.jnnual report he savs, "In conscqaenca of the sus-
pension of the application of funds appropriated
f r the prosecution of the works under the supervi-
sion of the (Quartermaster General's office, during
the season for active operations, little progress has
been made in them *ince my last report " The
difference of statement between the two high
lunc'ionanes m relation to the same matter pro-
duced some ambigú tj, and to clear it up, this
Hoise called up n the Pres di"nt for the true sta'e
of the case Well, Mr. Van Buren sends us his
message, m which he admits that he hfd suspended
tbe who e of the appropriations- fe r for'ificafons,
and l"rge sums f r other objec's, amounting in the
aggiegate to #1 638 317, and this su*pension con-
tinued at le^st as late as tbe 8th day of November.
emigres was shortly to assemble, &ni might be a
little curious about this matter, it was therefore
deemed advisable that Mr Secretary Woodbury
should on that day send a communication to the
President, informing him that the Treasury wes
in such condition that this suspension or postpone-
ment might be terminated, and we learn of no fur-
ther ofiicial action upon the snbjec> The Presi-
e'ent had direc <*d the suspension of these appropri-
ation , and were the officers ard agents charged
w th their di bsrsement, or any person out of his
pr \y council duly advertised that it had ceased?
Vh° *¡emb°r from Ohn ["Vfr. Doncín] on yester-
day read us a l"tter fr m tne S cretaiy of War, m
*.i ch he ci ncedes that the contractors upon the
wo'hs at Old Point Comfort had not been paid for
heir labor, and that they could not receive pay-
men' un'il the 1st of April, m consequence of the
P esu'ent having postponed the appropriation for
that ior.ihcation. Mr Pomse't pushes the Presi
dent still deeper into the motass. But this is onlv
one of the insianccs of duplicity, concealment, and
p.e/ar cation, w h wh ch the Pre ident's annual
messa r te?rrs Honever, itis characteristic, for
if ever he has written a single sentence that earned
an honest purpose and meaning in plain straight-
forward language, I do not recollect to have read
it.   Among the refoi ms which I expect to see ia>
