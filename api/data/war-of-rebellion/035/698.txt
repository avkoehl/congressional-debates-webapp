GENERAL: All quiet in our front to-day. The scout under Major Bacot has returned.

Citizens report that General Granger's command arrived at Versailles at 3 o'clock yesterday evening; also that General Jefferson [C.] Davis' command arrived there about dark. The scout captured two stragglers from General Davis' command, who reported that their command had gone on to Versailles. Citizens report that they are building a bridge across Harpeth River, and that they intend to go on to College Grove.
