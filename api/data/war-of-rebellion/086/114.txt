yet. My forces should be increased. It will not do to abandon the country north of this to a merciless rebel raid if it can be avoided. Not knowing the condition of affairs east of me I cannot form much idea of the force the enemy can bring to bear against my position. I repeat the desire to hold this post at all hazards, and request that you will strengthen so I can do so.

CHILLICOTHE, October 19, 1864.

General CRAIG:

Scout arrived from Carroll County line since my last dispatch. No force discovered. This scout camped a part of last night at or near where road from Utica to Carrollton crossed the Carroll County line. Nothing new from any other direction. General I regard this point as the key to m ore loyal territory than any point on the railroad. The loyal men north of this must not be abandoned if it can be avoided. I repeat my request of several days since that you send some artillery to this post if practicable.

Colonel, Commanding.

CHILLICOTHE, October 19, 1864.

General CRAIG:

My dispatch concerning rebel scout within my lines this evening is explained. It seemed so well authenticated I could but believe it. I will some day explain the matter to you, when you will see my action was dictated by prudence. I have returned my men to quarters. Will keep out a strong picket and be on the alert.

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier-General CRAIG:

Macon, October 19, 1864-6.23 p. m.

Captain FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

Colonel Hayward reports a force of bushwhackers southwest of Hannibal. I also have information of Colonel Perkins being in Fayette, camped in Fair-Grounds. Have sent a proposition to General Douglass to clean him out. If he answers favorable shall start to-night. One of my scouting parties had just got in from Randolph and Chariton Counties. They ran into a part of Anderson's, Pitney's, and bill Stephens' commands; killed 14 and wounded 3; captured 20 horses. So you see they are leaving this country.

WM. FORBES,

Colonel.
