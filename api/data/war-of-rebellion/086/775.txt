MILITARY COMMANDER FORT TUBAC;

SENOR COMMANDING OFFICER: I regret exceedingly to find myself compelled to return to Sonora to report to my govrnment your not having permitted me to pass to present to you the communications that I bore from it for you and for the Governor of Arizona, since, according to your second note of to- day's date, you tell me to leave my communication in Calabazas, and that it is altogether impossible that I, the bearer, should deliver them into you own hands as Governor Pesqueira ordered me to do. I am told, furthermore, that you cannot permit a personal interview, notwithstanding my having sent a passport sufficiently accrediting me as an official envoy of the government of the State of Sonora, and as such deserving to have been received by you I now retire, I repeat, to report to my government, and I shall wait in Yuma only long enough for you to have the goodness to send to me at that place the said passport that I sent you by my dragoons for your inspection, and which I believe was handed to you, to return to me. I have the satisfaction of repeating myself your attentive, faithful servant,

FRED A. ROMSTEDT.
