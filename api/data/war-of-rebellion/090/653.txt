greater portion of the rebels made good their escape. Their force consisted of about 100; was that recently commanded by McNeill, now commanded by Woodson. We captured eight of them, wounding one, all of whom were brought in. We suffered no loss. We captured and brought in the horses of the above-named prisoners and a few others, together with 46 cattle (beef) and 460 head of sheep. A portion of this stock had been driven into the country by the rebel son their raiding expeditions, and the balance belonged to the citizens who are rebel sympathizers. There is yet a considerable amount of stock suitable for army use, and a very large amount of forage in the vicinity of Moorefield, which is being collected and sent off the rebel army. The rebel force at Moorefield was preparing for a raid upon our lines when we reached the place. We returned to this place at 5 p. m. on the 8th.

The conduct of the troops on the expedition was all that could have been desired.

I will forward a complete report or list of our captures, with descriptions, &amp;c.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. R. LATHAM,

Colonel Fifth West Virginia Cavalry.
