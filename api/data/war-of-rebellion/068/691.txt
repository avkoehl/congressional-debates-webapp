HEADQUARTERS,In the Field, May 12, 1864.

Major-General SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

A courier from General Beauregard has just been captured with dispatches for General Hoke, whom he was to find on the Drewry's Bluff road. He came out from Petersburg on the turnpike, and states that he met about a regiment of cavalry going toward Petersburg this morning. He further states that there are but few troops now in Petersburg, but that many have passed through there within the past few days.

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 12, 1864.

General BUTLER:

General Turner will have to march back across the creek to get to General Gillmore and then march around to him. His men are very much fatigued. Under these circumstances do you think he can make the march to-night to be of any assistance?

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 1.30 a. m.

Major-General SMITH:

In compliance with orders from General Gillmore, I have the honor to report to you for instructions. My division will be ready to move at daylight. I would suggest that I have a company of cavalry assigned to my division; it will expedite my march under any circumstances one-half.

Respectfully,

JNO. W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General W. F. SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have sent back one battery, but have retained my horse artillery on the plain, where I can use it to good advantage. Two or three regiments were seen about two hours ago in the direction of the enemy's lines moving from Drewry's Bluff toward the pike.

Respectfully, your obedient servant.

JNO. W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
