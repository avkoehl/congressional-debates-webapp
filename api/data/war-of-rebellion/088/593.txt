By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 30, 1864. (Received 9.30 a. m.)

General HUMPHREYS:

I do not think the large works on the plank road nearest the Chimneys are as safe as they should be. The enemy's pickets, being so very close there, afford unusual facilities to the enemy for attack. It seems to me a part of the reserves ought to be near these works.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 30, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:

I have to report that there has been no change in my command of importance during the last twenty-four hours. I have this morning 1,100 men on fatigue, of whom 500 are at work on the new redoubt at the Strong house. The picket-line near the Strong house was advanced about 400 yards to cover the working party, as the redoubt is being erected outside the present line of intrenchments.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 30, 1864 - 10.15 a. m.

General HANCOCK:

Your dispatch of this morning received. The commanding general directs me to say that the division near the Williams house may be established in the vicinity of the Jones house, or anywhere else on the plank road that will make it most available as a reserve in that part of the line. The division near the Avery house is required as support for the Tenth Corps as well as for the front of Mott's division or part of it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 30, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

A deserter from Finegan's brigade came in to-night and reports all quiet in the enemy's lines. He says his brigade, of Mahone's division, were in the fight August 25.

WINF'S S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
