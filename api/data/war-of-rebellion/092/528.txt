HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Milledgeville, GA., November 23, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

By instructions of the General-in-chief, I give you the following directions: Continue to destroy the railroad eastward to the Oconee in the most complete and thorough manner, burning and twisting every rail, and the same for a distance to the west toward Macon; also, destroy the Oconee bridge. You may lay your pontoon over the Oconee, but do not cross any of your command until further orders. Hardee has probably swung around via Albany for Savannah, which the general says is all right, and he don't care particularly. Kilpatrick will be moved here, or in this vicinity, for the present. The probability is we will concentrate at or near Sandersville. Prosecute the railroad destruction in the most thorough manner, and communicate with the General-in-chief frequently.

I am, General, respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Milledgeville, November 23, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: I am directed by the General-in-chief to acknowledge the receipt of your detailed and interesting report* of the operations of the Army of the Tennessee since its departure from Atlanta, and, further, to says he is well pleased with the promptness of its movements and efficiency of its service. Special Field Orders, Numbers 127, containing the instructions for the next movement, were dispatched you to-day, and, as promised, I inclose another copy in this. Major-General Slocum's column entered this city yesterday, and the Fourteenth Corps came in about noon to-day; everything with these two columns has been eminently successful. At this place quite extensive magazines and arsenals have been found, besides large quantities of arms in the State Capitol itself, which will be appropriated or destroyed. The enemy will be minus a large and valuable quantity of property by our possession of the place. The railroad also has been most thoroughly destroyed. This wing will move early in the morning by two columns, the Twentieth Corps now being east of the river. The General-in-chief would write you did not his arm trouble him so much as to prevent him.

I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
