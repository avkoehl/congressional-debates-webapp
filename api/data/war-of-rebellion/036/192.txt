SHELBYVILLE, TENN., May 23, 1863.

JEFFERSON DAVIS, President:

Sent 3,500 with the general; three batteries of artillery and 2,000 cavalry since. Will dispatch 6,000 more immediately. Have no orders. The General did not consider it safe to weaken this point.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

RICHMOND, VA., May 23, 1863.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding, &amp;c., Shelbyville, Tenn.:

Your answer is in the spirit of patriotism heretofore manifested by you. The need is sore, but you must not forget your own necessities.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., May 23, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Via Canton, MISS.:

Your first dispatch was so changed as to present the names of W. H. Taliaferro and Wilson, both supposed to be errors. Bowen was ap pointed, supposing him to be with Loring. Since your dispatch received to-day, gave order to appoint Walker major-general. Am making every effort to aid you, and hopeful of junction of your forces and defeat of the enemy.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JACKSON, MISS., May 23, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Troops are coming very slowly. The last of Bragg's arrived on Tuesday. Since then but 300 have arrived and 1,300 are reported this side of Meridian. An officer who left Vicksburg on Tuesday reports that an assault near the Yazoo road had been repelled this time. It is said here to-day that another was made near the Jackson road and also repulsed. This gives me confidence in Pemberton's tenacity. If army can be organized and well commanded, we shall win.

Major-generals in proportion to the number of brigades are necessary. Is Major-General Ewell assigned? I have great confidence in him, and should be glad to have him.

J. E. Johnston.

JACKSON, MISS., May 23, 1863.

The PRESIDENT:

The number of troops I expect to concentrate now in Mississippi is 19,000, exclusive of the garrisons of Vicksburg and Port Hudson. The latter I have ordered to join me. Vicksburg is invested. Number, 16,000 or 18,000. Grant's force is estimated at 60,000.

J. E. Johnston.
