HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 28, 1863.

D. B. HARRIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief Engineer:

COLONEL: The commanding general desires the empty gun chambers and passages at Battery Gregg to be converted into bomb-proofs.

Filled sand-bags must likewise be held in readiness there, and in Batteries Wagner and Simkins, for repairs.

The slopes at Battery Simkins will be sodded as soon as possible, as a preservation against the effects of the wind.

The channel at the west end of Sullivan's Island must be obstructed, as far as practicable, with the old boom and torpedoes, to prevent monitors from taking position, in that quarter, whence to take in reverse or enfilade Battery Bee.

Boats and flats should be collected in safest place in the creek in the rear of Sullivan's Island, to establish communication with Christ Church Parish, in case the bridge should be destroyed.

Lookouts or observatories should be erected in Batteries Cheves, Haskell, and Ryan, to watch effect of practice.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
