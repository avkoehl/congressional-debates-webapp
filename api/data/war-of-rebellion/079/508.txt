I would respectfully call your attention to the above, which shows that it will be impossible to continue to operate this road, if the workmen cannot be kept on the road. I trust that you soon will be able to take measures to clear out this robber band, which seems to be confined to the part of the road from Mitchellville to the tunnel. The other parts of the road are comparatively secure.

Very respectfully, yours,

JAMES GUTHRIE,

President Louisville and Nashville Railroad.

Will your order a detachment of the THIRD Illinois Cavalry, now of Paducah, of 177 men, to report to me by rail at Stevenson, Ala.?
