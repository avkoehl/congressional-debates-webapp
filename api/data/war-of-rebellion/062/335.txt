Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Thirteenth Corps:

Orders are received here to send to Louisiana all of the Fourth Division and all that portion of the Third Division now here. This evacuates this point, as there are no other troops here. I have not received any orders to abandon any other position now occupied by me, although I shall have left only 4,000 effective men, black and white, and, under such restrictions as have heretofore been placed on me, I do not conceive that I have the authority to act in that matter without orders.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
