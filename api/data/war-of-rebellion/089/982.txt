This is all of interest to-day's papers. Two deserters in to-day, one of whom thinks some troops moved toward the river yesterday. This not reliable, as the man was on picket. He says the rumor was that it was Kershaw's division.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Butler left orders for an expedition to the country between the Piankatank and Potomac, to burn and break up sundry places. The officer going proposes to take the companies of cavalry at Harrison's Landing and one from Williamsburg, with a force of infantry. As part of this cavalry was posted by your order, I ask if it can be now removed.

General GRANT,

City Point:

General Ferrero telegraphs* movements within the enemy's lines on his front, which he is inclined to think indicate an attack. I think it more probable the enemy are detaching a portion of his forces.
