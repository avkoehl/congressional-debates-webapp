HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

Brigadier-General TURNER:

General Harris has reported to me. He tells me that the two brigades which are to come here have not yet arrived at Bermuda. He does not expect them till to-morrow morning. I will have transportation ready for them. I suggest that if the draught of water of their vessels will permit they should come in there to Jones' Landing. You say that General Ord directs that one brigade shall be encamped on the right of Camp Holly. Does he wish them to go outside of the line connecting that work with the Deep Bottom line? The ground there is either a quite steep hillside or low, and, I think, rather damp.

Brevet Major-General.
