CAMP TENTH OHIO VOLUNTEER CAVALRY,

Greensborough, N. C. May 7, 1865.

CHIEF OF POLICE:

SIR: On the 4th of May, 1865, Companies B and K, of the Tenth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, at the railroad company's shops of the North Carolina Railroad, between Hillsborough and Greensborough, N. C. found between $80,000 and $1,000,000 in gold buried in boxes and sacks, and marked Commercial Bank of New Berne, N. C. The money has been divided amongst the finders and officers of the command. There is to be an investigation of the matter by division officers but of course that will not amount to anything. I understand some of the officers concerned are about resigning with their booty in their pockets. I should have sent information through the proper military channel, but have no idea that such a communication would reach the proper source. If any action is taken in the matter it should be at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY BROWN,

Captain Company H, 10th Ohio Vol. Cav., 2nd Brigadier 3rd Cav. Div.

Respectfully returned.

My attention was called to this matter some two weeks ago and steps were immediately taken to recover the money. Several thousand dollars have been recovered and I hope to get much more, but it will take time, as the most of it was secreted by the men who found it. I will make a full report as soon as practicable.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Colonel OWEN STAR,

Commanding Second Kentucky Cavalry, Durham, N. C.:

You will move at once to this point. You will find forage at Hillsborough and Company's Shops.

THOS. J. JORDAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding.
