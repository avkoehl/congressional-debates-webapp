Major-General HANCOCK:

Whilst at City Point a telegram was received from the Secretary of War saying the President had suspended the order for the reorganization of a veteran corps, but that in a few days action would be taken and the order issued. My visit was satisfactory.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 16, 1864-8.40 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I am glad that you have arranged your matters satisfactorily. I believed it would be so, knowing the merits of the case.

I am, sir, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 16, 1864-8.50 p. m.

Major General G. G. MEADE:

I know the Secretary of War has always been well disposed toward me. If the interests of the service are such that a delay here is necessary, in connection with the veteran corps or otherwise, well; but I have been constantly engaged during this war, when not on my back from wounds, and for the last three years I have entirely ignored my personal interests when the public service was concerned. I have not much faith that my services will be required in connection with the veteran corps, since the matter has assumed so much importance that the President has thought proper to suspend the order of the Secretary of War for its organization. I suppose that other persons have desired the position, or the matter would not have been brought to his attention.
