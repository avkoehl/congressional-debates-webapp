General CORSE,

After consultation with General Grant it is determined not to make the march from Grenada. Smith's forces will therefore come up the Mississippi to Cairo, and thence up the Tennessee, there to join McPherson. I have sent orders to that effect. After Smith is out of Red River you may therefore rejoin me, wherever I may be, via Nashville.
