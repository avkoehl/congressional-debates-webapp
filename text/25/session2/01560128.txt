CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
because he had every reason to believe that the
House and the country would be peifectly satisfied
with the response of the Secretary of War to Mr
E's resolution on the topics adverted to in this dis-
cussion. This was in relation to the captuie of
Oceola.
Another subject upon w hich he w ished to make
a remark or two was a more painful one, viz m
leference to the capture of Sam Jones and his
companions Mr E had eveiy ie?son to know
that these men came in under the most sacred
pledges, and that it was with the greatest difficulty
the Cheiokee delegation could induce them to come
m And when they did, what was Gen Jesup s first
proposition'' Why, as preliminary to any nego-
tiation, that those people snould bring in their
wii es and children, and what was Sam Jones's an-
swei1 Why, that he never heaid of such a pieh-
minary to a treaty as that oi suirendeung the chil-
dren and arms, and that he could not absent to it
After some further remarks, Mr E avowed
himself unwilling to cairy on this war any longei,
though he Mas not for yielding He wished a pa-
cificatory course to be tried Ho would arm the
t\ecuiive with atthorit/ and appropn-tions to
enable him to adopt a course wmch should teimi
nate it pacifically
Mr HAYNES said, without intending to an-
swet, or attempting fo reeont Me ihe mistaken
opinions ha had heaid, and many of which h- had
regretted to hear, he had risen so'ely for the
purpose of bunging back the committee to
the question before it Some weeks ago
the Committee of Wa\s and Means re-
ported a bill to covci tne whole sum ne-
cessaiy for ihe current year Since thai bill was
íepoited, the committee had been called nnon or
notified by the War Department that drafts were
1} ing over lor services already performed, and sup-
plies already furnished, and there was no money
to meet them Upen tniy representation the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means had come to the
House and asked a suspens on of as rules,
foi the purpose of considering the propriety
of making a partial appiopnation for the suppres-
sion of Indian hostilities Now, neittier the com-
mittee, nor, as Mi H believed, had any other
fi end of the Admim>Uation, who pioposed to sup-
port this bill, designed taking the House by sur-
prise The very document read at the Cieik's
table gave to the House the information that
this partial appropriation was a ked toi under
extraordmaiy cucumstances, and it wa^ equal'y
well known that the bill covering the «hole sum
estimated for the service by the Secietaiy of War
then lemamed untouched, foi as general, hbeial,
violent discussion as gentlemen pleased Wh\, then,
should so many irrelevant topics be brought in now,
oi national honor, the validity of the treity, the con-
duct of the wat, the tieatmeiu of the Indians the
conduct of the Cherokee delegation, 01 any ihmg
else' Tbe state of the ease cilled upon thun to
act promptly, it asked them foi an appio-
pnation under circumstancts of great stiess
upon the Department oi War, and ne did
hope, under thes^ considerations, and with ( ehngs
as strong upon some of the topics introduced to-day
as any othei man, and as w tiling, n not as able, to
discuss them , he imp ored the committee to re-
port this bill, and taiee a futu-e occasion, «hen the
geneial bill was brought up, to enter upon the
genei tl debatp
Mr BELL adverted to the icmaiks made by
him this morning in favoi < f ll   bill, and wished
the House to bear them in mind, for he was op-
posed to the course oi his friend fiom Vig-nta
He then made some stuctures upon a iett i Irom
the Washington ««respondent oi 'he Richmord
Enquir r, which be pronounced to be an u liounl-
cd, false, and malicious slander

the following remarks
Mr Prfsident Having íeceived, some days
asio, unquestionable information of the payment of
fishing bounties and pensions in Massachusetts,
in bills of the Commonwealth Bank of the city of
Boston, by which payment heavy losses had been
sustained by meritorious and well-deserving per-
sons, I felt it my duly to call the attention of the
Senate to the subject, and to move an inquiry, for
the purpose of obtaining information respecting
the circumstances fiom the proper ejuarter
In consequence of this public proceeding, dic-
tated, on my part, by nothing but a sense of obli-
gation, the official paper of the Administration m
this city, on Saturday last, published the following
paragraph
" DEETOrs   TO    THE    COMTONWFALTH    BaNK    OF
Massaciiuslits—The names of five or six gen-
tlemen, friends of the Administration, are given
as debtors to the exploded bank at Boston, and its
bankiuptcy isheld up as the consequence of loans to
them The truth is, the only real Democrats whose
names are paraded as bonowers, owe it only a few
thousand dollars, which they are able to pay thrice
o\er It all its loans were as safe as those thus
exhibited to shovi the reason of its insolvency, the
bank would be the soundest in the Union, tor it
w ould be without a bad debt The Coniervahve
loans ruined it We understand that Mr Web-
ster nas had his bills protested m this bank for
$10,000 at a time
"In his resolution of mquny into the state of tie
b nk, therefore, we find no demand made as to the
amount of bills protested in it any time, nor for
the n">mesof the drawers "
Now sir, if I owe the Commonwealth Bank a
dollar, I am not conscious of it If I ei er did owe
it a dollar, I do not lemember it, nor do I recol-
lect, or believe, that any note signed by me, or any
1 ill accepted bj me, or by any agent, or cleik of
mine, m my behalf, was ever protested at that
bank, or delated m payment
Having said this, sir, I ma} be relieved fiom
making any remarks of rny ow n on the character
of this publication I will only read a remark of
the Fditor himself, in the same column, which
contains the publication, and which remaik is in
the following words
" Those attacks upon the private concerns of
public men, for paity purposes, are exceedingly
despicable "
So thinks the Editor, and I, for one, concur with
him in opinion

Public Lands, to which had been referred the me-

from fh e hundred to one thousand persons, and
some of these w idows To make them m any w ay
