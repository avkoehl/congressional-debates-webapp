is in preparation, and Decatur probably the point of attack I think their patrols are watching their own deserters more than anything else. One came over yesterday, and I have made arrangements a man on the other side to send them over as fast as they come. He says the woods are full of them, but they are afraid to venture. I learn that there are some boats and a flat-boat on the other side in some of the inlets. I have directed Mr. Harris to ascertain and get the deserters to bail them out and bring them over if possible; also to learn where Jackson is encamped. If practicable, I intend visiting him some night. The neighborhood has sent a delegation to wait upon in relation to the protection of their property. I find many of them in rather a destitute condition, some of them quite so. I think our men have not used proper discrimination in their levies. The officers are not sufficiently explicit in their instructions to the men, or the men are not sufficiently careful to follow the instructions received. I think generally the greatest evils arise from the latter cause. Since my arrival I have returned a number of animals taken by my men before I came, and a number of others I would return if they had not been sent off. I will see you further in relation to this expedition when I return.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

W. D. HAMILTON,

Colonel, Commanding Ninth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry.

DECATUR, April 17, 1864.

Major-General McPHERSON,

Huntsville:

Unless I relieve Sweeny's forces by forces from here he could not take over four regiments and what artillery he wants. The Seventh Illinois, mounted, could be added if you think his move would make the right secure.

Send scouting parties to Brown's Ferry, direct to Elk River, and Lamb's Ferry, and have them to watch the river closely.

Brigadier General J. C. VEATCH,

Decatur:

That ammunition left here at midnight on trains. Do you consider it reliable that Roddey is in the valley? He is reported to be in front of Dalton. A few men sent to the rear of Flint River would settle the question.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
