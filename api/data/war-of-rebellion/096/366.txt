CITY POINT, VA., February 4, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Two or three miles each week scouts are sent from here into Richmond. The only funds the provost-marshal has for defraying their expenses is U. S. currency. These funds naturally would attract suspicion, and have therefore to be converted for their use. If, therefore, you have any rebel currency, I would respectfully request that from $20,000 to $50,000 be sent to Colonel George H. Sharpe, assistant provost-marshal-general, at City Point.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 4, 1865-10 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have ordered the cavalry to move down the Weldon road to-morrow for the purpose of breaking up the enemy's wagon train as far as they can, which is being used to draw supplies from Belfield to Petersburg. A corps of infantry goes as far as Stony Creek in support. I telegraph this so that you may know the object of the movement when you hear of it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 4, 1865-3 p. m.

(Received 6 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

I respectfully request that General Ord may be named as permanent commander of the Department of Virginia. If Hancock is to be returned to the field I would name him for the Department of the South, otherwise I would have my recommendation of General Terry made to the Secretary of War in a dispatch of yesterday.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 4, 1865-5 p. m.

(Received 7.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

If General Washburn is not placed in command of West Tennessee I want him to come on the command at Norfolk. He is one of the best administrative officers we have, and will effectually stop supplies being sent through our lines to the enemy wherever he is. We want such a man at each of the above places.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
