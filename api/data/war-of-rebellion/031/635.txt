to the same source of information for the names of many officers who distinguished themselves in this battle, and by their good conduct specially merit the approbation of the Government and of the country.

I herewith forward to you a list of the casualties of this corps on December 13, from which it will appear that 26 officers were killed and 195 wounded; 318 enlisted men killed and 2,350 wounded; 18 officers and 508 enlisted men missing, making a total loss in this corps of 3,415. Nearly all who are reported as missing were taken prisoners in the fight.

By the official report of Major Bridgford, provost-marshal of the corps, herewith submitted, it appears that we captured 521 prisoners, of whom 11 were officers. The report of Major Bridgford exhibits a gratifying statement of the small number who straggled from the ranks during the last action, and affords further evidence of the improving discipline and spirit of the army.

The report* of Major Bier, my chief of ordnance, shows that we captured 4,446 small-arms.

My medical director, Dr. Hunter McGuire, gave special and skillful attention to the wounded.

Major J. A. Harman, chief quartermaster; Major W. J. Hawks, chief commissary, and Major G. H. Bier, chief of ordnance, discharged their respective duties well.

During the action I received valuable assistance in transmitting orders and discharging other duties from the following members of my staff: Colonel S. Crutchfield, chief of artillery; Colonel A. Smead, inspector-general; Captain A. S. Pendleton, assistant adjutant-general; Captain J. K. Boswell; chief engineer; First Lieuts. J. G. Morrison and J. P. Smith, aides-de-camp, and Second Lieutenant W. G. Williamson, engineer department.

I trust that the victory of Fredericksburg, with which god had blessed our cause, will continue to be gratefully remembered.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Lieutenant-General.

Brigadier General R. H. CHILTON,

Asst. Adjt.and Insp. General, Army of Northern Virginia.
