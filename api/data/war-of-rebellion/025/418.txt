Major-General GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Army at La Grange:

G. W. Tatum, G. W. Clay, W. E. Ballard were part of escort of flag of truce with dispatch of 26th instant, proposing exchange of Thomas Boyle, J. H. Sinon, and Thomas Sinon for James F. Bell, E. W. Matthews, and Dr. Theodore Wilkenson.

The prisoners were left under flag of truce in custody of Tatum, Clay, and Ballard near Somerville, while Captain Bell proceeded to your headquarters with dispatches. Major Mudd captured Tatum, Clay, and Ballard, horses and equipments, besides three horses and a buggy used to convey the prisoners, Boyle and two Sinons.

This is a violation of the flag of truce, which is only necessary to bring to your notice to have corrected. Captain W. Bell and J. E. Raney are bearers of flag of truce and this dispatch.

Very Respectfully,

R. V. RICHARDSON,

Colonel, Commanding Regiment Partisan Rangers, C. S. Army.
