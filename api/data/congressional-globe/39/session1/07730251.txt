which are apparent from year to year, it is
apparent that we can place no reliance upon
England as a steady and regular market. She
will buy of us when we can undersell others,
and only then:

Examination will show that while for twelve
years, between 1848 and 1860, our exports to
Great Britain of our cereals was reduced
twenty-seven percent., the amount imported
by her from all countries increased over nine-
teen per cent.
How insignificant is such a market for the
sale of the vast cereal production for which
the agriculturists of the West seek a sale. In
1860 the western States produced in corn alone
470,190,097 bushels, and of wheat 102,251,127
bushels; while New England, which itself
raised but 10,175,856 bushels of corn and
1,090,894 of wheat, furnished, with the other
eastern States, a market for the sale of more
than six times the quantity of grain exported
to all Europe.
The western farmer who looks abroad for a
permanent and regular market for his products,
and demands free trade that he may buy the
manufactures and productions of England un-
taxed, should be treated at once for ophthalmia
or strabismus.
Our total agricultural production of 1860 is
returned at $1,856,000,000; our total exports
were $272,282,873, of which amount there was
in cotton $191,806,555, showing export of
other commodities to be $80,476,318, and
proving that we consumed at home and inter-
changed $1,583,717,127.
I am aware that since 1860 our exports of
breadstuffs to Europe and to Great Britain has
increased, but this is a circumstance which by no
means indicates that we can continue to export.
The wheat-bearing regions of Russia, espe-
cially of her Polish dominions, are unlimited,
affording a more ready supply, and the act of
emancipation of the Czar is likely to a great
extent to increase the cereal production of the
empire.
Speculate ,as we will, we shall find that
America lias always furnished and will con-
tinue to furnish the largest and most reliable
market for American productions.
Let me allude now to the mutual relations
of the American farmer and the American
manufacturer, to show the folly of a free-trade
remedy for a dull market of our products, by
citing statistics which are reliable:

ployed in manufactures in the several States named in

Wisconsin  14,641 775,881
Ohio  65,749 2,339,o02
An analysis of this table will show the im-
mense disparity in the percentage of popula
tion employed in manufactures between the
eastern and the western States, and that while
in three manufacturing States of New England
the number of males employed was equal to
almost eight per cent, of the whole population,
while New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylva-
nia had nearly six per cent, of their population
thus employed, Iowa had not one per cent.,
Illinois and Indiana less than one and a half
per cent., and Ohio a fraction over two per
cent.
Deny to the manufacturers of the East the
protection which will maintain their labor as
manufacturers, and they and the millions who
are dependent on them for support cease to
be consumers of what others raise, but they
must become producers in the broad West in
competition with those who now complain of
an inadequate market for their present product.
Will it help the farmer of Ohio, of Indiana,
of Illinois, or of Iowa to increase the number
of producers and diminish at the same time
the number of consumers? The practical ap-
plication of such a doctrine will produce deso-
lation throughout that portion of our country
which bore up under the burdens of the war
without complaint, and which is ready to sub-
mit to any but unnecessary sacrifices for the
good of the Republic.
I am not here as the advocate of the manu-
facturing interests of New England or New
York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, as a mat-
ter of local or sectional consideration. New
England is rich and powerful. She is able to
take care of her own interests, and I fear she
is selfish enough to do it, no matter who may
suffer. She has grown rich by protected indus-
try, until her enormous wealth constitutes pro-
tection to her great manufactures, and perhaps
suggests indifference to protective legislation.
Her patriotism has uniformly, I believe, been
colored by her supposed interest, and perhaps
till human nature is modified and reconstruct-
ed, the same phase will be exhibited before the
country.
I quarrel not with New England, unless she
force the contest. I drew my first breath in
the pure atmosphere of her mountains, and
slept in childhood beneath the shadow of her
pines. Her laughing rills, her rocks, and glens
are photographed upon the recollections of my
youth. I love her noble charities, her art, and
her enterprise. Yet I speak not for her. I
speak for labor, American labor, wherever
within the limits of my country it requires or
seeks protection.
I demand this now, because the time is now,
and the place is here, when and where we must
determine the policy of the Government in
reference to the great subject of its finances
and its productions.
A debt of more than three thousand millions
will rest upon the industry of the country when
all the liabilities incurred during the rebellion
shall be aggregated and funded. That debt
and its interest must be paid, without a mur-
mur, to the last dime. It is sanctified by the
cause for which it was created and by the pur-
poses it accomplished. But it must be paid,
not from invested capital, but from its income
and from the profits of labor, and, so far as
practicable, by indirect taxation imposed for
the protection of labor as well as for revenue.
It is doubtless necessary, under the exigencies
of the day, to continue for the present all of
the modes of raising revenue which have been
adopted in order to insure the maintenance of
the public credit. But the experience of civ-
ilized nations suggests the avoidance of direct
taxation whenever practicable, and the supply
of revenue by customs upon imports.
Mr. McCulloch, iu his elaborate Descriptive
and Statistical Account of the British Empire,
(volume two, page 402.) in speaking of reve-
nue and expenditure, says:
"Direct taxes on property have been the curse of
which they have been introduced.

poverty; some of the most powerful incentives to in-
dustry and economy are in consequence destroyed,
at the sa,me time that inferior stock, machinery, &c.,
are made use of." * * * * "Though
theoretically equal, a tax either on property or in-
come, or both, is practically most unequal, we may
get a pretty accurate notion of the income derived
from land, houses, funded property, and mortgages,
but all beyond this is mere guess-work. There are
no means by which to ascertain the value of farming,
capital stock in trade, the profits derived from them,
or the incomes of professional men. No inquisition
into the affairs of private individuals can ever dis-
cover these particulars, and we need not dwell upon
the impolicy of any system of finance that sets the
duty and the interest of contributors into opposition,
and makes the profit by concealing or perverting tho
truth." 1 * 4 * "Speaking generally,
an income on property should not be introduced ex-
cept under very peculiar circumstances, and should,
if possible, be reserved for a dernier ressort when the
other or more legitimate sources of revenue may
be insufficient, or when money must be had at all
hazards."
A reference to the sources of revenue in
England will show that she has constantly and
successfully relied on customs as the principal
means of filling her Treasury, and she has
never yet adopted a system of duties which
has not augmented her receipts.
While, therefore, I believe it would be un-
wise to dispense with our excise and income
taxes at the present time, I believe that our
duty consists in seeking a liberal revenue from
imports, and that such imports should be so
adjusted as to encourage our own industry, and
thus increase our internal revenue from the
profits or income of production.
Nature with munificent profusion has show-
ered the elements of wealth over slope and
mountain, valley and. plain, from the shores of
the Atlantic to the golden gates of the Pacific.
All that our country now requires is peace,
followed or accompanied by the developments
of remunerated labor.
English statesmen long since based their
claims to commercial supremacy on the coals
and machinery of the kingdom, and on the con-
trol of the manufactures of cotton and of iron.
" Iron and coal, the sinews of manufacture,"
said Sir Robert Peel, " give us advantages over
every rival in the great competition of indus-
try. Our capital far exceeds that others can
command. In ingenuity, in skill, in energy,
we are inferior to none." "The large capitals
of this country," said a commission reporting
to Parliament in 1854, "are the great instru-
ments of warfare against the competing capital
of foreign countries, and are the most essential
instruments now remaining by which our man-
ufacturing supremacy can be maintained, the
other elements, cheap labor, abundance of raw
material, means of communication, and skilled
labor being rapidly equalized."
What element of wealth has England that we
have not? How many elements have we of
which she is denied? Her coal-fields arc rich
and so are ours. Hers are limited, ours are in-
exhaustible. Tomlinson. in his Encyclopedia
of Science in 1852, estimates the principal
coal-fields in the United Kingdom available for
working at about ten thousand square miles.
The coal-fields of Iowa and Illinois alone ex-
ceed fifty thousand square miles, while Ohio,
Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Tennessee, North Carolina, Michi-
gan, Georgia, Alabama, Indiana, and Arkansas
make a coal-field as great in area as all Eng-
land. The vast beds of ores of iron located in
every part of the country, and in association
with tho coal, far exceed in extent and rich-
ness the ores of England.
The two cardinal elements of power are ours;
and beyond the iron, the coal, the gold, and
silver regions of the West, the copper mines
of the. North, the lead of Illinois, Missouri,
New Jersey, and other metalliferous forma-
tions. show an extent of variety of raw mate-
rial for the employment of labor with which
England furnishes no comparison.
The cotton plant is ours; not imported, but
the product of our fields. By the application
of free labor, and under a svstem well organ-
ized tho product of five million bales may be
