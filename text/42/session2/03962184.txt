Mr. ALCORN. I present a memorial of
the Legislature of Mississippi, praying the res-

the road, but by reason of the revolution the

now ask Congress to extend the period for the
construction of the road and to restore the
grant. I move its reference to the Committee

true history of their case. I move the refer-

The motion was agreed to.
Mr. COLE. 1 present a memorial, or rather
resolutions, of the Chamber of Commerce of
the eity ot San Francisco, relating to com-
merce on the Pacific ocean.
Mr. POMEROY. They cannot telegraph a
memorial.
Mr. COLE. I ask that these resolutions be
printed in the Globe.
The VICE PRESIDENT. They are reso-
lutions affecting a public matter, apparently,
and if there be no objection they will be
ordered to be printed in the Globe.
The resolutions are as follows:
San Francisco, April 4,1872.
The Chamber of Commerce held ameeting to-day,
at which the following was adopted unanimously:
The increasing claims of commerceupon the Pacific
ocean, the opening of more friendly intercourse with
tho countries bordering thereon, and larger facili-
ties for the transportation of passengers and freight
to the Atlantic sea-board, require permanent lines
of first-elaps steamships, under more liberal patron-
age of the Government, from San Francisco to China
and Japan; as also to tho British colonies of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand; thatthe encouragement of
those two lines of steamers by Congress,semi-monthly
to China and Japan and monthly to the Australian
and New Zealand colonies, is a matter of vital im-
portance to the people of tho United States, inas-
much as it would undoubtedly result in diverting a.
large portion of the trade and intercourse with most
of the countries and productive islands of the Pacific
ocean from the time-worn routes, via the Capo of
Good Hope or the Isthmus of Suez, to the American
continent.
That in tho opinion of this chamber it should bÂ«
equally the policy of the Government to foster inter-
course by sea as well as by land, and to grant reason-
able subsidies to the lines of mail steamers, for the
purpose of securing foreign commerce to our own
shores, as well as to extend assistance to lines of
railroad for the purpose ot facilitating and develop-
ing internal communication. That it is the earnest
prayer of this chamber that Congress should extend
such assistance to steamers plying between this port
and Japan as will enable them to secure permanently
the vast advantages of trade between those coun-
tries by the establishment of a semi-monthly line;
and also by such othor assistance to steamers plying
between this port and Australia and New Zealand
as will promote the important and increasing inter-
course with these rich and rapidly developing coun-
tries.
The following also passed the senate and assembly
of California April 1:
tiesolved, We do hereby earnestly solicit Congress
to grant a semi-monthly service and an annual
subsidy of Sl.OOO.OOu in aid thereof, and do hereby
instruct our Senators and request our Representa-
tives in the "United States Congress to use their best
endeavors to procure the passage of a Federal statute
effecting these objects.
Mr. SRENCER presented the petition of
Littleton Crabtree, of Mobile, Alabama, pray-*
ing the removal of his political disabilities;
which was referred to the select Committee
on the Removal of Political Disabilities.
Mr. CORBETT presented a petition of citi-
zens of Oregon, praying that any law repealing
the duties upon tea and colfee may not take
effect until at least ninety days after its enact-
ment; which was referred to the Committee
on Finance.
Mr. SCOTT presented a memorial of citi-
zens of the United States, engaged in the man-
ufacture of earthenware, stoneware, &c., re-
monstrating against the proposed reduction
of the duty on earthenware and stoneware ;
also praying the enactment of a law imposing
a specific duty of seven dollars per ton on all
foreign earthenware, stoneware, clay drain or
sewer-pipes, and chimney-flues, and a duty of
nine dollars per ton on the bends, branches,
and other fittings of such pipes and flues, and
a duty of ten dollars per ton on all foreign
clay chimney-tops ; which was referred to the
Committee on Finance.
He also presented a petition of citizens of
Pennsylvania, late soldiers of the Army of
the United States, praying legislation to give
all soldiers, sailors, and marines who served
honorably and were discharged after such
service, and their heirs, if deceased, $8
per month for the time served, deducting Gov-
ernment bounty heretofore paid ; which was
referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.
Mr. CALDWELL presented three memo-
rials of citizens of the United States, remon-
strating against the extension of patents of
Allen B. Wilson for improvements m sewing-
machines ; which were referred to the Com-
mittee on Patents.
Mr. CLAYTON presented a memorial of
the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Com-
pany and the Little Rock and Fort Smith

ing the construction of a bridge across the

SETTLERS IN IOWA.
Mr. POMEROY. The Committee on Public
Lands, to whom was referred the bill (II. R.
No. 590) for the relief of certain settlers ou
the public lands in Iowa under the provisions
of (he homestead laws, have had the same
under consideration, and have directed me
to report it back without amendment, and to
recommend its passage.
Mr. WRIGHT. For the first time, I be-
lieve, since I have had a seat in this body, I
ask that that bill be pat on its passage at this
time. It was reported upon favorably in the
Ilouse of Representatives, and passed that
body, was referred to the Committee on Pub-
lic Lands here, aud has now been reported
favorably by that committee.
Mr. POMEROY. I would have asked for
its present consideration at the request of the
Senator, but for the fact that it contains a long
list of names of the parties benefited by it,
which it would take some time to read.
Mr. HABLAN. They can be omitted it!
the reading.
Mr. POMEROY. If the names are omitted
it will occupy but a few moments ; but if the
names are read, it will take some time.
Mr. WRIGHT. There is 110 necessity for
reading those names at all.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
Iowa asks that the bill just reported by the
Senator from Kansas favorably from the Com-
mittee on Public Lands may tee considered at
the present time. Is there objection ? It will
be taken up subject to a demand for the reg-
ular order if it should give rise to debate or
occupy too much time.
Mr. WRIGHT. I ask that the names be
omitted in the reading. There is no necessity
for reading them.
The VICE PRESIDENT. _ There appears
to be no particular legislation in the bill omit-
ting the names, excepting the concluding para-
graph of the bill.
Mr. POMEROY. The concluding paragraph
contains ail the legislation that there is iu the
bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the list of names will be omitted in
the reading, and only the first and the con-
cluding portions of the bill wdl be read.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (H. R. No. 590)
for the relief of certain settlers on the public
lands in Iowa under the provisions of the
homestead laws.
Mr. POMEROY. Thesesettlers settled npon
land that was supposed to be within the limits
of a railroad grant, and the lauds were with-
drawn from market; but when the road came
to be actually located, these lands were found
to be outside the limits of the grant, and.
therefore, although their entries havo been
canceled, in equity they ought to have them,
for they are equitably entitled to them. There
were thirty days allowed for these lands to be
restored, and, technically speaking, they had
their entry within the thirty days, which was
thirty days sooner than they ought to have
done it, so that the relief they asked for must
be given by Congress.
Mr. W1NDOM. They have been on the
land all the time.
The-VICE PRESIDENT. The last para-
graph of the bill will be reported, which con-
tains the legislation.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
lie it enacted, &e.. That the homestead applica-
tions of the following persons, made at tlia land
