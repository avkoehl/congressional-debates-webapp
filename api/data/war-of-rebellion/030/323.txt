MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., January 13, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

There is no longer any doubt that Joe Johnston stopped Bragg's retreat, and that Longstreet is expected from Virginia. Their large cavalry force is constantly annoying me. They are now on their way to attack our river transportation with Forrest's and Wheeler's cavalry.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

NAVY DEPARTMENT, January 13, 1863.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

The western gunboats are under command of acting Rear-Admiral D. D. Porter, who is now at Vicksburg. You had better communicate with Captain A. M. Pennock, senior naval officer at Cairo, Ill., who will co-operate, under general instructions from Department.

GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., January 13, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The provost-marshal-general's report shows, to date, 3,197 prisoners, representing one hundred and twenty-two infantry regiments, eighteen cavalry regiments, seven sharpshooters, nineteen batteries of artillery. Total, one hundred and forty-seven regiments, nineteen batteries. We shall probably have about 3,800 prisoners. The enemy have retraced their steps to the line of Duck River, from Shelbyville to Wartrace. Their numerous cavalry goads and worries me, but I will try and be equal to them. Look out for re-enforcements.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

GALLATIN, January 13, 1863.

The following just received from Stanley:

ON HILLSBOROUGH PIKE, Eleven miles from Nashville-10.30 a. m.

Nothing but stragglers found. Forrest and Wheeler passed over to Hardin pike. They had eight pieces of artillery; were passing all night. Heard four reports of cannon in the direction of Harpeth Shoals. Harlan will come out the Hillsborough pike.
