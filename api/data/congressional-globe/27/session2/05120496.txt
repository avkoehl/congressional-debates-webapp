Mr SMITH chairman of the Committee on Public lands,
who reported the bill explained that tour special bills similar
to ithadbetnrepoited favorably upon by that committee The
land on which to locate bounty grants had beenexhaus ed and
the law au honzing the is&ue of warrants for the giantmg of
land had aiso expned therefore, this bill was made nece<-saiy
Mr ¡? said, the committee besides those four cases, had also
repotted a general bill to coverall cases of a like character
The committee believed it would be better to pa&s the four «pe
cial cases, as there was no question of their justness, and leave
the geneial bill to cover future cases, of which there wtieprob
ably some hundreds
Mr McROBERTS made some remarks m favor of author
izmg strip to be issued to the individual, to the amount of the
land, in hen of the land
Mr SMITH thought the bill authorized such i«sup
Mr KING remarked that tms was a noveleare He believed,
if the principle was adopted, m this and >ther bills of like char
actei,of issuing scrip, it would open tho- door to speculation
He wou d coi fine the individual to ti e land He feared the
same system of frauds and speculation which existed under a
former bill would spring up, if bcrip was author ¿cd to be is
sued m ' en of the lands
Mi SMiTH remaiked that two of those feilU had been re
ported, and authorized the isc=ue of senp in lieu oí the land*
and the other two ni-idc the grant in land, on tht, rcq icst of
the petitioners It made no difference to the Government
whether the scrip was lbsued or not the land was given m
either case but it would make great difference to thc^old sol
dier to whom the grant wis proposed to be made if scrip
wa icaued to him instead of the land, and it was his wi°h to
sell, he could get more f>r the scrip than he could for the land
Thus wmle it male no difference to the Government, it m ght
occasion a loss to the md<vidual
Mr KING moved to strike out the portion of the bill authei
izing the issuing of scrip, so as o compel the ber ennary to take
land
Mr SMITH of Tndiani said, as tn s ^em*1' to be teat <j ie^
