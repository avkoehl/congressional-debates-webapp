joyed Whatevei might be the diversity of
opinions with regaid to the comparative advan-
tages of the several States, he gloried in beholding
no single feature upon the broad face of our coun-
try without charms to allure, and bounties to re-
ward, the honest labor of man with plenty, secunty
and happiness He should not, at this time, depart
from the order of business to delineate the beauties
or disc-lose the resources ol the young, powerful,
and rragnificent State ft om whjch he came, nor
should he now attempt to measure the waaei-
power, bo'b natural and aitifical, which streams
along bet iiuitful Mutae , 01 he cunnstless m le
lals that lie beneath it These ih rigs aie, to some
extent, known to all the Western S natois, as also
to some others, «he ha/e traveised that region
The resolutions were then read
Mr KING could not but admne the great for-
beaiance of the Senator from Missouri, [Mr Linn]
who forbore to urge the claims of hi  State, because
he was satisfied that, when an examination was
made, she would have the preference Now, as
it seemed to be the fashion ot the day foi gentle-
men to make a display of the advantages possessed
by the States the\ lepresented, he would merely
advert to one cucumslance 10 show that ihe claims
of his State were not behind thos.p of ¡Vissomi, or
any other. A distinguished gem'eman, whom 'he
Senator Irom Missouri would at once acknow ledge
tobe one oí the most intelligent obveivants and
judicious men m the countty, [Gen Jackson,] was
ol the opinion that this establishment should be
located m the State ol Alabama, at the loot of the
Muscle shoals, where mmetals, watei power, and
facility ot tiansportation, existed to the gieatcsl
degree He hoped that the Senator from Missouri
would alloiv some weigit to the opinions ol the
distinguished gentleman who sloou so high in his
estimation, and that h* \ ould abate some h tie ot
his confidence in the superioi ad\an'a¿es ol Mis-
soun over the other Wesie n States ile further
indulged the hope that thepiesent President would
not, aftei the examination was made, overlook the
claims of Alabama
Mi LINN laughingly observed, thit he had
gieat respect kr the opinions of Gen Jackson in
biiJa maiteis, but that distinguished individual
certainly could not have leiieiled that tlicie
was such a place as Missouri at the time, ol he
never could have made the icmaik He would
maintain, there was not such a spot in any S ite,
[Mr BtNio-v, in an uiu'er tone "Siy 11 the
world "J jes, he would say not in the whole woi d
He knew of one twenty miles «quaie in that
State which would include two iron mountains,
which possessed nearly all, if not all, the íequisites
for armories and foundries Iron oies ot every
quality, lead, coppei, ¿me, sulphur, alum, cmeiy,
plumbago, sal mtie, grindstones, and water power
to an unlimited extent Arms could be thence
transported by the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mex-
ico, to the western frontier by the Missouri, Ar-
kansas, and Red nversand then tributrues, and to
the northern lakes bj the 11 nois, Wisconsin, and
Ohio livers LI" said he f d c mfidetil that when
he capacities of Missomi lorsic'i a wet were
examined into, the claims ol me other Wtslern
States would vmk into insignificance
Mr ALLEN asked the Senatoi from Missoun

The bill for the prevention and punishment of
duelling in the District of Columbia was taken
up, Ihe question being on the amendments ol the
Committee on the Judiciary.
[The following brief synopsis of the debate is
given, until the speeches on the occasion can be
written out ]
Mr. CLAYTON expressed his objections to
duelling in a very pointed manner, and his sincere
desire to do all in his power to suppress it. He-
very much doubted, however, the eflicacy of ihe
bill before them. Such was the severity of some
of its provisions that it would be next to impossible
to procure convictions under it. And there were
oiher objections wheh he could not reconcile to his
mind. One of the provisions sought to make the
sending of a challenge felony, which was only a
misdemeanor m the eye of the common law. Mi.
Clayton argaed the subject at considerable length,
lated to subsarve the purposes for which they were
intended While he admitted the practice of duel-
ling to be both illegal and immoral, yet he said it
was not of that class of dimes which should subject
offenders to the cells of a penitentiary, and make
them the associates of thewilest felons. There
has nothing in the offence that was ether base,
mean, oi sordid, neither were those likely to be en-
gaged m it, persons who we would dare to send to
a penitentiary to be classed with thieves and vaga-
bonds. The moral sense of the community would
be shocked at such a measure, and such a law
would be rendered a mere nullity, from the inter-
ference of the Executive perogttive He depre-
cated duelling as much as any man could do, and
was disposed to go all reasonable lengths to prevent
it On the whole, he believed some legal provision
necessary. If he could get the modification he de-
sired, he would vote for the bill as amended by
the Judiciary Committee, although he sincerely be-
lieved it would not have the good effect its friend
designed
Mr PRENTISS replied at some length, con-
tending that the practice of duelling was condemned
by all laws, human and divine, that it was regarded
as a crime by every Government in Christendom,
was subversive of the gieat principles of the Chris-
tian religion, and ought not to be tolerated by any
Christian people Mr P looked as much to the
moral power that this law would have, as to its
penal enactments He asked if any man of honor
could allow himself to fight a duel after the pas-
sage of such a law? The subject w as, in his opi-
nion, a momentoas one. We were acting not
for the present time, but the passage of this bill
would have its due weight on all after generations
The people of this country expect, nay demand of
us, some enactment bv which this odious and sinful
practice may be discontinued and for ever prevented
Mr LINN was of opinion that the Senator from
Delaware had treated the subjpet with so much
sound practical sen«e,that little sise could be left to
be said on the subject What community (said
Mi L ) could be found that would pronounce a
man eithei a murderer or felon, who might have
chanced to kill anotier m fair and equal combat?
No man, he was persuaded, that came to act on his
responsibility as a juror would be prepared to ten-
der such a verdict Many of the States had passed
severe penal enactments in re'ation to th s matter,
and yet where w as the State where such laws, had
been carried into effect* Othei legislatures again
had sought milder remedies, such as punishing du-
elling by disfranchising their citizens, rcnoenug
them forevei after in&>pable of holding ofhois oí
profit or trust, honor or emolument, snch laws, he
maintained, had a more wholesome action thin
those severe, unjust and cruel enactments, becau p
the one was generally earned into effect, whilt the
other was little bet cr than a cWd letter To ihuv-
tra,te the effect of public opinion on tl is subjeet,
Mr. L instanced a case m his own State, where the
people were as much adverse to fighting as those ol
