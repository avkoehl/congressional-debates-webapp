NATCHEZ, MISS., June 22, 1864.

Statement of Mr. George Edwards, who got to our line three days ago: He is a cripple, and for that reason was permitted to come through their lines. He was detained by sickness near Winnsborough, La., four or five days, and while there he saw a good many of Harrison's men. Their camp was 10 miles east of Winnsborough, on Bayou Macon, on a man's place by the name of Osborn. There were about 1,000 of them, and Harrison's headquarters were at that place. There were about 400 more at Sicily Island, and three companies at Trinity. He says that a lieutenant that he was acquainted with told him that they were expecting General Taylor's force to come there and General Polignac's force, and as soon as they get there that they were going to cross a force over the river above Rodney and attack Natchez in the rear, and that part of their force was going to attack Vidalia at the same time. He says that their mail crosses close to Rodney.
