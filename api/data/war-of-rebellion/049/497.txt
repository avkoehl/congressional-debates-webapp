I do not know whether or not to use this route would take Generals French's and Sedgwick's batteries out of the way. I think not, if they moved by daylight, so as not to get lost.

No other news. Lieutenant Matthews brings this and awaits orders.

Yours, &amp;c.,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

But one battery has come in; the others are on the road. They have been working twenty-four hours and have had no feed. Captain Randolph reports the horses fagged out. One battery goes with my head of column.

[P. S.]-General Prince reports seeing troops moving over a ridge toward Verdierville during the night. He watched them passing an hour a half.
