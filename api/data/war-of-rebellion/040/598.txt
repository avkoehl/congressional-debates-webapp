I have read General Burnside's address to his army, in the Philadelphia Inquirer of the 23rd (before it was put in motion), and a general movement was announced in the same paper. The late storm has probably retarded the accomplishment of their plans.

Under the circumstances, I am more than usually anxious about the supplies of the army, as it will be impossible to keep it together with-out food.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, January 27, 1863.

Brigadier General W. E. JONES,Commanding Valley District:

GENERAL: The question of provisioning this army is becoming one of much difficulty. I have thought that the present might be a favorable time for you to send into the counties of Hampshire, Tucker, Randolph, Pendleton, and Highland, and any others that you may find convenient or useful, with a view of collecting cattle or salt meat for our use. I have heard that in the counties named cattle may be procured by judicious and energetic men acquainted with the country and the inhabitants; and a necessity exists for employing every meats to supply our wants. It is not my intention that you should interfere with or interrupt any agent of the Government engaged in collecting supplies, but request, on the contrary, that you give them any aid in your power. Should there be any region unoccupied in which provisions can be secured, I hope you will lose no time in endeavoring to collect them.

I am glad to learn, by your recent report, that you have a body of cavalry in the lower part of the Valley, to restrain the operations of General Milroy. By having movable camps, and relieving the men engaged, from time to time, you will be able to protect our citizens and curtail the operations of predatory parties.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, January 27, 1863.

Brigadier General W. E. JONES,Commanding Valley District:

GENERAL: Captain Long's company, of the Phillips Legion Cavalry, General Hampton's brigade, has been detached from the legion and duty at Staunton for several months. I think it better that it should rejoin the legion, and desire to desire to have another company ordered to Colonel [H. B.] Davidson, if you can spare one without detriment to your to your operations.

If a mounted company is required at Staunton, and you can supply one, please order Captain Long's company to join General Hampton near Culpeper Court-House.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, R. E. LEE,

General.
