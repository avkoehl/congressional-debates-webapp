Major-General HOWARD,

Your dispatch reporting position received. You can send your wagons into Atlanta, and have them loaded and parked. General Easton reports plenty of grain there and Colonel Beckwith has stores plenty also. Collect all your men to get paid and do everything necessary to make a clear start about the 10th.

MOUTH OF WHITE RIVER, November 5, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD:

I have ordered the detachments of the SIXTEENTH and Seventeenth Corps to be sent from Missouri to Memphis by the quickest route. The cavalry DIVISION is also ordered. The infantry will probably come to Cairo. The cavalry DIVISION is far advanced in the pursuit of Price by the way of Fort Smith and White River. I have directed General Dana to remain at Vicksburg until the arrival of General M. L. Smith or General Veatch. The crossing of the MISSISSIPPI by the rebels under the renewed order of Jeff. Davis will probably be attempted between this place and Vicksburg.
