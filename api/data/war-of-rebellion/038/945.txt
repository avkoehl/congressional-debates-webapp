south of the river, at or near Rocky Ford, so as to defend the crossings in that vicinity. You will probably find forage between Rocky Ford and Goodman's Ford. You will throw out scouting parties in your front, so as to give you timely notice of any advance, and will forward immediately to these headquarters any information that you may obtain. If the enemy should advance, you will harass them as much as possible, and if they should retreat or move so as to give you an opportunity to attack them on the flank or to annoy them by picking up stragglers, &amp;c., you will give them as much trouble as possible. If you find that they are advancing toward this place in force without attempting to cross the river in your front, you will fall back to join the main body here.

The furloughs granted to your men to harvest their wheat will expire in the course of the next sir or seven days, and the general directs that you collect them as rapidly as possible, and, if the enemy do not advance by that time, you move with your command to this place.

I am, &c., your obedient servant,

W. A. GOODMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General RUGGLES, Columbus, MISS.:

My scouts report that the enemy will advance on me in two columns,

one in front and the other by Oxford. Will you arrange to assist me? I was instructed by General Johnston to call on you if necessary.
