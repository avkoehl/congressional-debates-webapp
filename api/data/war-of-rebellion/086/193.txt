BIG BLUE, October 22, 1864-8.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel STARK;

The enemy makes feeble demonstrations this morning. I fear he may be trying to flank me on right. Countermand the order bridging forward Lawrence company.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, October 22, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel STARK:

Have directed those posts to stand firm. They may be overpowered, but if we press Price hard I do not think he will desire to stop to take small posts. My troops are being supplied for the purpose of moving early in the pursuit of the enemy.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, October 22, 1864-6 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel STARK:

We have had a severe fight this afternoon, the enemy turning our right flank. We attacked and drove them westward, where I fear they may attack Kansas towns. Pleasonton has just sent me a messenger, and we have heard his guns pressing the enemy on the other side.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
