Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding SIXTEENTH Army Corps:

GENERAL: Seeing your last returns, I am satisfied another DIVISION can be spared from your command. In the District of Columbus and the District of Jackson there are more troops than are necessary, particularly after giving up the 87 miles of road north of Jackson. I would direct, therefore, that such troops as you deem advisable be brought to the front to relieve Lauman's DIVISION from railroad duty, and bring that DIVISION to Memphis or vicinity, and hold it in readiness to be moved here.

I will send transportation for Lauman's DIVISION in a few days.

The same directions given for the troops now en route, as to what shall be brought along, will be applicable to these.

Direct all the troops coming from Memphis to debark at Greenville, MISS., unless otherwise directed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT.

Commanding SIXTEENTH Army Corps:

GENERAL: Admiral Porter has, at my request, sent a gunboat to bring down or convoy the paymaster with their funds. I wish you would hasten them off with all dispatch. the absence of the paymasters has a very depressing effect upon the men, many of whom have families at home suffering for the means of subsistence. Then, too, I
