General EARLY:

GENERAL: A scout has just come in and reprots the enemy in large force of infantry marching toward Shady Grove, and when he left, an hour ago, they were one mile this side of Tood's Tavern. I have just thaken nine prisoners, who say that their army is in motion, one part moving up the river and the other down. their is evidently a mvoement up the river, and I am now trying to develop it. I shall remain here till I ascertain more fully what is in my front.

Yours, very respectfully,

WADE HAMTON,

Major-General.

HANOVER JUNCTION, May 11, 1864 - 4.15 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

My scout is just in at 2.30 a. m. The enemy's cooumn was passing Ground Squirrel Church on the Louisa or Mojntain road. This proves their destination to be Richmond. Geneal Stuart['s rear has just passed out of Taylorsville. Send copy of this to Mr. Seddon.

WAR DEPATMEN,

Richmond, Va., May 11, 1864 - 11.30 m.

General BRAGG:

GENERAL: I will see whether there cannot be sent up with the provision train a regiment, or at least a battalion, who may guard the trin and remain to re- enforce at Hanover Junction. Such regiment must be dtached from one of the brigades to be brought up by Geneal Ransom, for untilhe aarrives Ishould not deem it safe to draw any men formthe trenches.

Very truly,

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

P. S. - If this suggestion does not meet your approval, please inform me; otherwise I shall arrange with GeenL Ransom on his arrival.
