HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,September 7, 1864-9 p. m.

Camp. M. A. RENO,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Force, Middle Military Division:

CAPTAIN: The reconnaissance to Salem Chapel has returned without meeting any of the enemy's forces in that vicinity. The regiment on its return struck the Winchester and Berryville pike close by the Limestone Ridge, where they found the enemy's pickets, driving them off after a brief skirmish. They could notice from there many camp[fires in the direction of the Opequon, and heard from citizens that the position of the enemy's forces was the same as before the recent movements. Early's headquarters are reported to be on the Berryville and Winchester pike a short distance beyond the Opequon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

HAPER'S FERRY, W. VA., September 7, 1864.

(Received 1.30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

An intelligent officer just from the front reports that the enemy have retired from General Sheridan's front. I shall doubtless hear the facts this evening, and will promptly report.
