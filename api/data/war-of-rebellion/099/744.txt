used here to advanctage if, in view of your geneal plan, they are not more needed elsewhere. As soon as Couch gets up I will test the quaestion as to what can be done. It is raining almost constantly and the fountry is nearly covered with water. Fortunately, the effect is not so bad here as in a clay soil, but it makes some of the swamps and streams impassable.

I am, generak, very resepctufully, your obedient servant,

Major- General.

P. S. - Major- General Schofield left for the front this morning without signing the above, and has since directed me to forward it with this explanation.

Very respectfully,

Major-General SHEMAN:

The enemy has checked our advcne at Southwest Creek, this side of Kinston. A portion of Johnston's force is here, and I presume the rest will be concentreated in my fornt, now that you are understood to have turned toward the coast. This makes it probable that I will not be able to take Goldsborough or even Kinston before you come up. I will work as far forward as I can and put the railroad in order as far as I go.

SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
