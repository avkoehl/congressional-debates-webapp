and along Bull Run Mountains, such as we have before reported. The First Michigan Cavalry, returned just now (2 o'clock) from a scout in front, report that, from smoke and fires observed in the same localities, there is a force there. Are our troops in front? For we fear a conflict with them.

All is quiet within range of our guns.

Captain C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of Washington:

I have asked for information, which has since been answered thus:

The body of ours was driven into Centreville by the enemy's cavalry from Aldie this day. It is now reported that a force is passing along our front at Yates' Ford, 2 miles below this place. All apparently quiet otherwise, but we are on the alert.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Commander-in-Chief:

The field return for February 28, of the troops sent to replace the Pennsylvania Reserves, exhibits the following discrepancy in numbers, viz:

The extra-duty men of the Pennsylvania Reserves have all been sent to join their command, with General Heintzelman. I have to request that two regiments, of an aggregate strength of 1,233 officers and men, may be sent to me to make up this deficiency. The absentees from the Pennsylvania Reserves that will undoubtedly soon rejoin their commands are so much in excess of those from the regiments sent here that 1,500 officers and men would not more than make the exchange equal.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
