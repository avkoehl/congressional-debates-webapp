HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., January 11, 1864.

Brigadier General GEORGE D. RAMSAY, Chief of Ordnance, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: My object in this communication is urgently to request that a battery of eight pieces of 10-pounder rifled Parrott guns be sent to Vancouver Arsenal, including all the implements and equipments complete, and a good supply of fixed ammunition for the same. There is no complete battery of field artillery in this district. Four 6-pounders are drilled at this post by Company A, Ninth Infantry, but the carriages are unfit for field purposes. Our great remoteness renders it proper there should be gathered here in time of peace the material of war. I hope therefore that you will be able to comply with this request.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
