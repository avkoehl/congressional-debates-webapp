route, but many will take the route from Chico by Susanville ans Surprise Valley, and in any event troops must be sent to the country beyond honey Lake to protect the settlements, as the Indians have been committing depredations there during the whole winter, and will continue to do so until property chastised. Half of Captain Mellen's company, Second Cavalry, at Fort Crook, can be spared from that post during the summer for field operations, and in addition, if two full companies of cavalry are employed in the service above referrd to, it is believed that ample protection can be given to all. Under these circumstances that propriety of retaining Captain Doughty with his company at Camp Bidwell, with a view of the summer movements, is submitted to the consideration of the general.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept of the Pacific, San Francisco:

COLONEL: To-day I received by the hands of Mr. J. Comstock, of Red Bluff, the inclosed pettion from citizens of Red Bluff, Shasta, and Melville, asking for protection on the route to th Owyhee mines and the establishement of a post near Goose Lake*. I informed Mr. Comstock that the subject had already been considered, and that protection would be given on the great thoroughfares from both Red Bluff anc Chico to the mines, and that a post would be established near the south end of Goose Lake. This accords, I believe, with the designs of the general, as I understood him in a conversation on this subject when he visited this city.

Very respectfully, your obedient servnat,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

J. COMSTOCK, Esq. .

Red Bluff:

SIR: I have received and examined the petition of the citizens of Red Bluff, Shasta, and Melville, Cal., asking that a military post be established near Goose Lake, and that protection be afforded on the new route to the Owyhee mines. A plan for the general protection of the settlements in the northeastern portion of this State, embracing the great thoroughfare from Red Bluff and Chico to the Owyhee mines, has already been prefected, and in addition to the movable columns of nounted troops it is design to establish a post at Goose Lake. I do not suppose that the roads will be in a condition for the passage of wagons before the 1st of May.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
