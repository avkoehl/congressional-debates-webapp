SIAIND BOUNDARY QUESTION.
DEBATE   IN   THE   SENATE,
TmoAX, Match 1, 1839
The Senate having: taken up the resolutions re-
poited by the Committee on Foreign Relations,
on the subject of the difficulties between Maine
and New Brunswick—
Mr BUCHANAN said the subject had been
so much discussed that he would now offer no
further explanation of the resolutions, though be
would be happy to reply to any questions which
Husrht be proposed.
Mr WILLIAMS, of Mame, remarked that
fee* felt & delicacy in saying anything in opposi-
tion to resolutions reported by the able and distin-
guished Committee on Foreign Relations, quid he
could, hardly expect to succeed in obtaining any
modification of them, however much he might
wish it, but the subject was all important to Tus
State, and he would not refrain from expressing
his views frankly, and then would acquiesco in
whatever decision the Senate might make
The first three resolutions are intended to jus-
tify Maine and her course in the late movements
in the disputed territory, and to declare " that
the Senate will cordially coopeiatc with and sus
tain the President in defending the lights of the
country,should her Britannic Majesty's Govern-
ment persist in carrying its avowed tlr-tei mination
into execution, and attempt, by military force, to
assume exclusive jurisdiction over the disputed
territory" This was all very well, but ho re-
gretted that the first resolution, instead of saying
" that the Senate can discover no trace, through-
out the long correspondence which has been
submitted to them between the Governments of
Great Britain and 'ho United States, of any un-
derstanding, express or implied, much less of
any explicit agreement, such as is now alleged,
that the terruoiy in dispute between them on the
northeastern boundary of the latter shall be placed
and remain under the exclusive jurisdiction of her
Britannic Majesty's Government until the si ttlc-
ment of the question," did not contain u simple,
positive, and ducct denial of any such ngreimenl
or understanding as was alleged ami claimed by
bar Biitonnu Majesty's Minister and the Luu-
teiinnt Governor of New Brunswick, in thi n late
communications He could not think, while her
Majesty's repiesentativcs undertook to asseit
and repeat that such an understanding and agree-
ment had hi en made with us, that we should
content ouiaelves by suyms that we cannot dis
cover any trace of either throughout the conc-
«pondence between the two Governments If
such undeistanding or agreement ever existed
or was made, we were paities to it, and must
know the fact, if it never was made, then say so,
and not put it on the ground that we cannot dis-
cover it in the correspondence If wc refer to
the correspondence to piove that no such agree
ment or understanding was cvei made, we may
expect that her Majesty's Government will do
the same, and insist that the agiciment and un-
derstanding are proved by that correspondence
We have ahcady seen what Gieat Butain can
do by diplomacy Hor whole claim to the dis-
puted territory has no foundation but what grows
oat of diplomacy and tliplomaticcorrespondonce,
and, with the skill and adioitness of tier diplo-
matic agentSjshe will make out of the coircspond-
ence a. better pretense to exclusive jurisdiction
than she can to the territory in dispute, and he
would be most reluctant to open a new question
with her Majesty's Government, to he determined
by the multifarious correspondence between the
two Governments If a man were to say to you,
Mr President, that he had a certain undeistand-
ing or agreement with you, which you felt confi-
dent was not so, would you say to him that you
could not discover any trace of it in your commu-
nications with him ? Or, being conscious that you
had not made any such agreement, would you
not say so m direct terms., and thus put an end
to the question' Mr Pox and Sir John Harvey
say that, by the agieement and understanding
between the parties, Great Britain was to have
exclusive jurisdiction of the disputed territory
until the question of boundary shall be settled
The President and Mr   Forsyth say it was not
so.   Let us say the same, and nothing moie, and
thus maleo on end of this pii t of the case
But it appeared to Mr W that it was unneces-
sary, impolitic, and still moie objectionable, that
we should undertake to declare what was or is the
pieciso undeistanding oi aigument between the
parties, and yet the first lesolution nsscits " thit
there was and  s a clear subsisting understand
mg between the parties, under which they have
both acted, that until this question shall be finally
determined, each of them shall refiam fiom the
exercise of junsdiction over any poition of the
disputed terutorv, except such parts of it as may
have been in the actual possession of the one or
the other party," without intending to deny that
since 1825, there have been, from time to time,
understandings between the parties in reference
to abstaining from certain acts complained of as
offensive to tho one or the other of them, and to
the kind of possession and jurisdiction which
either party might enjoy, or that the resolution
describes those understandings, as a whole, with
tolerable correctness, as we understand them, yet
can it be safe or prudent for us lonfllimthnt there
was and is a clear subsisting understanding, mid
uwleitakt to define piccise ly what n is1 1 he
commitlcc believe it was nnd is as stated in the
icsolution The British Ministerand the Lieut n-
nnt Governor of New Biunsvviek affiim that it
secures to her Mti|csty exclusive junsdiction of
tlw whole disputed teinloiy, until the boundaiy
question is settled Why, then, undei take to say
what that understanding is ' Our construction of
the correspondence settles nothing, and tin But-
lsh constiuction of it will not settle it Wc nie
opening a door to interminable negotiation to
settle what never will be settled in that way
Any man who has looked, or will look carefully,
into the voluminous coiicspondencc between the
two Governments since 1825, will be convinced
that it is no easy task to determine what has bei n
or is the understanding of the panics upon the
subject of possession and jurisdiction of th dis
pun tl teintory, pending the negotiation as to the
boundaiy
Mi W rcf rrcd to and read many cxtincts
fiom the couespondenco between the Govern
ments consequent upon complaints, by the one
against tho other, of certain aets within the (lis
putcd territory supposed to be inconsistent with
the rights and understandings of the re spertive
parties, and contended that, while we had in
sisted upon our construction of them, Great But
ain had maintained a different construction, and
we had repeatedly protested against her unjust
pretensions What was and is the undeistand-
ing between the parties, is not, then, so clear as
the committee have supposed, and theie is no
necessity for us to embarrass ourselves by affirm-
ing, in these resolutions, what that understanding
was or is Besides, whatever that understanding
may have been in íeference to some parts of the
disputed terutory, it should not be applied to the
Aroostook country, the seat of present difficul
ties 'I hat rounti v has been in possession and
under thcjurisdiction of Massachusetts and Mame
more than thirty years Soon after the source of
the St Croix; was agreed upon and fixed, under
the treaty of 1794, tvv o ranges of townships west
of the line tunning due north from the monu-
ment were surveyed by Massachusetts, and the
township including the Aroostook river, near its
mouth, was giantcd, in 1817, and other lands
near it were granted soon after These lands
have been and arc now held under those grants
After Maine was separated from Massachusetts,
other lands in that region were surveyed into
townships, and divided between the two States
Until very recently, Great Britain did not claim
anyjuusdiction over that portion of the disputed
terutory, unless it be inferred from her keeping
a warden, as he is called, of the disputed tern
tory Within a few years past, Maine has ex-
pended large sums of money in opening and m
making roads into the Aroostoolc country, has
surveyed her lands there into lots for settlement
and cultivation, already there are some good
farms there, and great numbers of settlers are
preparing to take lots and reside upon them The
land is of excellent quality, and now that it can
be reached over good roads, it will be rapidly
settled and cultivated    la it to be expected that
Mame is forever to be restrained fromoccup)ing
and settling this valuable portion of her terri-
tory > For such reasons, Mr W felt it to be
his duty to ask, and to urge, the modification of
the first resolution, so that it should contain a
simple and dirfct denial of any undi rstanding or
agreement for the exclusive jurisdiction, by her
Majesty's Goveinment,of the disputed teintory,
until the question of boundaiy be settled, as lately
claimed by Mi Fox and Sir John Haivey, and
nothing more
To the fouith resolution Mr W had other ob-
jections, and he earnestly hoped that it would be
stricken out It was wholly annecessary and un-
called for In the contingency mentioned, Maine
would voluntarily pursue the course of forbear-
ance indicated by that resolution, she could have
no interest or inducement toaet otherwise Then
why threaten or admonish her " that, should she
refuse to do so, and determine to settle the con-
troversy for herself, by force, etc , in such an
event there would be no obligation imposed on
this Government to sustain her by military aid!"
Has Maine done anything to require or deserve-
this admonition fiom the Senate' Your resolu-
tions sustain arul justify her in all that she has
thus fir done Then why not trust her for the
future > Why suspect her m advance ? If you
would huvo Maine continue to assert and defend
hei rights as becomes a sovereign State, and a 
a im mbcr of the Confederacy disposed to main-
tain the peace of the nation, then lcly upon her
honoi and upon her suise of duty to the Union,
and not volunteer a threat or gratuitous admoni-
tion It will be time enough to give this advice,
and to declaie the obligations of tnisGovernment,
when Maine, by any net of her'a, shall deserve
it Until then, she should be treated as an equal
amonu equals, and possessing the rights aud du-
ties of n sovereign State Leave Maine to her
own r< sponsibihiy, and she will take pride m
acting fn inly and prudcnily Tell her in advance
what this lesoluiiou proposes to say to her, and
she may question the justice and correctness of
the piin iples nsboited, and hesitate to do upon
i ompuUion what she would readily do upon her
own usponsil illty Whutevei may have been the
intuition of the committee in reporting this reso-
lution, it nn hardly be doubted that Maine will
legaid it as dcrogatoiy to her as one ot the free
ÍMate s of tins Union, and it will be most unfor-
tunate if it shall be adopted Mr W therefore
moved that the fourth resolution be stricken out.
Mi BUCHANAN replied, that never had res-
olutions been drawn up with moie care than these
by any committee, and he did not expect that
they would meet with any opposition. Much that
was contained m the resolutions was a correct
summary of the views of the President The com-
mittee had examined the correspondence on this-
subject since 1832, at the time when the Senate
disaffirmed the award of the King of the Nether-
lands, and in that correspondence they found an
agreement m express terms, which had been in;
force since 1835, and which was the same as that
embodied in these resolutions, "that, until this
question shall be finally determined, each of the
two parties shall refrain from the exercise of ju-
risdiction over any portion of the disputed tein-
tory, except such parts of it as may have been in
the actual possession of the one or the other
party." During the pendency of the new nego-
tiation it became indispensable to enter into some
arrangement on this subject, and Mr Livingston
proposed that this should be the understanding
Between the two parties. The Government of
England concurred in this proposition, not has-
tily, for it was not answered till April, 1833, when
the British Minister agreed to the terms of the
proposition Mr B read from the correspond-
ence, showing that the agreement was such as he
had stated Here, he said, was a distinct prop-
osition, accompanied with its distinct acceptance,
and if it were necessary, and the time permitted,
it could be shown, that from that time to this, the
two Governments had adhered to this under-
standing
Mr B said he would endeavor, in a few re-
marks, which he would pledge himself to confine
within the limits of five or ten minutes, to show
more fully what these resolutions were The first
resolution, in the strongest terms that could be
