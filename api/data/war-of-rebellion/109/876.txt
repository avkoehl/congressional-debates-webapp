Monroe. A large body of troops to Yorktown and Williamsburg from Carolina and Annapolis. It is estimated at 60,000; 3,000 are cavalry. I have not been able to find who is in command, but have sent one of our scouts to find all the particulars and report to me when I go over again. I have engaged a man to operate in York in Williamsburg, and I will be able to give you a more detailed accunt in a few days. There is but one company at Newport News. The glasses have been ordered, two of them in Baltimore and one in New York. They will be here as soon as possible.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOHN F. MOORE.

WELDON, April 25, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commander-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:

Five regiments of Evans' brigade were ordered to North Carolina, and have arrived. One is at Wilmington, two at Tarborough, guarding prisoners, and two at Kinston. The Eighteenth South Carolina is still at Charleston. Colquitt's brigade on James Island can best be spared, but it is best to substitute Hagood's fine brigade, also on James Island, which has never seen field service.

General, Commanding.

WELDON, April 25, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Burnside's point of attack still uncertain and our iron-clad in the Neuse having grounded firmly, is it prudent to leave longer the forces in department so scattered? Is the object in view worthy great risk incurred? I know not yet what troops are about Petersburg. Here there is only one State regiment, and in Wilmington two regiments infantry, movable troops.

WELDON, April 25, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Every indication is that Burnside will attack Richmond via Petersburg. Are we prepared to resist him in that direction; can the force in this department be concentrated in time, are questions worthy of immediate consideration of the War Department.

WELDON, April 25, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commander-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:

If the enemy reducess his forces in front of Charleston, Wise's brigade can also be recalled. Afterward could I not strike Burnside in reark from Petersburg, if he advances on Richmond from Yorktown?
