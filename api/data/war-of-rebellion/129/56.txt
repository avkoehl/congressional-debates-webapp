In assessing the average value of "first-class artillery and wagon horses at $350," we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common-sense import. In other words, that horses should be selected and then impressed accordingly as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchase in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the Government needed at $350. But cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed. Yet under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses or brood mares of admitted high value are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the Secretary of War to have instructions forwarded to the impressing, we respectfully suggest to the Secretary of War to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to substitute in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as first-class artillery horses or first-rate wagon mules.

The term "average value per head" was used in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule. We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or one individual, that some might be estimated at $250, or even at less, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as $450, or above that amount-thus making an average value or price for a number of good, sound, and efficient horses $350 each, and mules $300 each.

In illustration of our views, we will add, that horse with only one eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a first-rate artillery horse, yet the loss of one eye would justly and considerably curtail his value. So a horse from ten to eighteen years of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a first-class artillery horse, but of course, however efficient or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value. Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a first-class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively exactly come up to the standard, and therefore are entitled to the comparatively exactly come up to the standard, and therefore are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced, as imperfections place them below the standard of first class, &amp;c.
