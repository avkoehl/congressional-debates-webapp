HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHEN VIRGINIA,October 9, 1863.

Brigadier General J. D. IMBODEN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: It is a matter of great importance, in my judgment, that our troops should advance upon the enemy in all quarters, for the purpose of preventing him from re-enforcing points more seriously threatened, of nothing better can be accomplished. I desire you to move some part of your force to Strasburg and scout over toward Manassas and Thornton's Gaps, to prevent anything from coming in rear of those of our troops which will now be operating in the direction of Woodville and Sperryville. Should you find no opposition, or such as you can overcome, you may continue your advance farther down the valley, taking care to observe closely the points above indicated.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: I think it very important that our troops everywhere should advance upon the enemy, even of nothing else can be accomplished excepting preventing him from re-enforcing points now threatened. Of course, if opportunity offers to do more, it should be made use of. I hope you will be able at least to make some demonstration which will detain such force as the enemy may now have in your department, and thus co-operate with the movement going on in other quarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
