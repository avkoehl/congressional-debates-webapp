Sir, said Mr P   that these offices are bestowed
* In expían" ti n of the above, we take the liberty
to s'ct- «hat Colonel Pierce, of the army, brot' er to
S nator Piece, was one of the officers who fought
wi'h giext bravery during the Florida war, and
Lieot, McNiel, who fell at the head of hiscorri-
psny, was nephew to Senator Pierce.—-EiL <JW 
hi this manner, the Senator from Missouri has ad
mated, but he has admitted them, at tne same time
declaring his disapprobation The pay of the offi-
cers of the army had remained, as it now was,
from 1791, (when the pay of the army was esta-
blished lower thin the pay of the officers of the Re-
volution,) to the piesent time Tne pay of the
Bavj has been raised within the la t three jears,
and that bianeh of the service was now, he be-
lieved, liberally paid, and justly iewan ed, although,
as a member of the other House, he had voted
asramst the increase, and on tb^ same ground that
he opposed ihisbill—bectus-  jt mide distinctions
unequal and ut.just, jlacmsihe stuff above tho e
who had fearlessly and gallantly done their duty
in ihe face oi the enemj This bill provides for
placing the slaft upon a footing w th the dragoon
service To this, Mr P said he had no objection
It also provides for increasing the pay ol the sol-
d ers and non commissioned officeis, and the offi-
cers o' the army proper Ihe gallant men who
have sacrificed their health in he m?rshes of Flo-
rida, and who, whenever c a led, have gone cheer-
fully into the field, are the tnlj p°rsons who have
received no increase of pay since h   pctof 1791'
Mr PiERCii. would inquire of the chairman of the
committee, whether the fiftn section o the bill
was intended to give an intimation to the Execu-
tive, that he was to appoint in] vidual  to ths to-
pographical engineer corp%-«ho v.ere emploved
thi re temporarily und"r the law ot April, 1824,
whether tney might be resigned *eutenauts, or per
sons who had never been connected with the army1
If this was not the intention, he did not understand
its impart, and if this wis the object, he desired to
enter his piotest toto calo He believed there were
officer^ m the aimy, fully qualified, who had done
done their duty on the fiontier and in Florida, to
discharge the du'ie&ih any of the staff corps, asd
he protested against other appointments until those
individuals \\ ere provided for If gentlemen de-
sired to enter the army, he wished them to take
their noviciate in active service, and if brave and
faul.ful there, he would urge th^ir promotion to the
staff wiih cheerfulness, but he had no expectation
that select ons would thus be made There was
little c'oubt, in his mind, that promotions would be
nia'e ii a manne toteiify the oft i p atedsaying,
that one campaign n Wa'hmg'on wjs worth two

Mr BEINTON, m it ply to the question of the
Senator from INew Hanpslure, [Mr Pierce,] said
that the bill llself contained the answer The sec-
ti n in re aticn to the topogia, hi<-al engmeero ex-
pressly pio\ ided that the oíficer> te I e appointed to
that corps should be taken from the a try, and from
such of the c.vtX cngmceis now rmnlcj ed as it "¡hou'd
be deemed advisable to ret-un Tne effect of this
was to confine ihe appointment to t.ie army, an 1
to the eiti7>ns employed under the act of 1824 It
gave the Utter no lega! right to be retained but
only inch of them as should be dinned advisable,
and if this the S-naie wou d have to judge as well
as the P,esident

would be susceptible 01 distribution among the State"
lam cjnmmed m the opinion that the State of Massar&u
setts has ie/tits members to pursue their own juilgmtnt m
tins in tier by Ji*. cour&e they have actually pursued hitherto.
The act of 1830 which has been treated in this debate as die
foundation ol pre emption rights, received the vote of the only
Senator from Massachusetts piesent [Mr Silsbee Jaud the votes
of seven out of eleven members of the House present from
that S ate [Messrs Davis Dwight, Everett, Gorham Hodges,
Kendall an 1 Richardson 1 When the act of 1832 passed, it
seems to have been consul red so little objectionable, that 'he
ayes and noes were not called upon \t, nor even a d vision had,
e ther in the ^enate or m the ttou^e The act of 1S34 passed
the hQnate u thorn opposition, or a recorded division, and re-
ceived the votoo of iwo out of teta oí the members fiom Siassa-
chu<°etts present in the House, [Messrs Choate and Everett J
One of the Senators from Massachuse Is [Mr Webster] sup
I jrted this bill by speech and vote And! have the proof be
lore me, that the opinions of his upon the aeneral subject whiak
that vote indicates are not new ones On Monday, Apni 2i,
1828 'he bill to gradúale the puce of the paVlic 'anas feemguTp
der consi Juration, Mi Webster proposed the followiag anient*
ment, viz
" That at any time, from arid after úi° tint day of ianuary^
anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and twenty nine, such
portions of the pubiic lands as sha'l have been offered acpuh^c
sale, and shall ¿iso have been subjsct to entry at privatesaie
for the term of------years, and shall still lemaiu unsold, shall,
thenceforwald, be offered at private sate, in parcels cóníormñag
to sectional divisions and subdivisions, at the rate of------per
acre
"Sec 2 And ie fui ther enacted^ That it shall and may
be lawful for any head of á family, young rain over-tbe agfe-of
twenty one years, or widow, not having received *don&ij!>R f
land from the TJniied States, and wishing to become an actual
settler on any parcel oi public land auihorized by thefirstsoc
tion of thib act tobe sold at------peiacie and not exceeding
in quantity the amount of one quaiier section to demand and
leceive ft m the pioper register and receivpi, a wiltteu per
mission to settle on the same, ut on paymert, to be made to the
proper receiver of the sum of------cents per acre   nnd if such
person  so applying for and receiving such permission, shall
forthwi h settle on the said land  and he or she er tua or her
heirs or legal representatives, shall cultivate the same for five
successive years, and shall be a citizen or citizens of the United
States at the end of that time, then, on proper proof being
made   before the ree, s'er and leceiver, of i uch ^ettierpent,
c iltivauon, and citizenship a patent shall issue tor the sard
, laud to the person who received such permi*tsK)D, dr his" or her
I lens or leg l represen atives    And the faith of the ltni.ed

public lands, according Id the provisions df "tins sefctid> fhafc
no dispensation shall at any line, be planted to any individual
lrom complying with the snb^tatnn! eonditiors herein pre*
I scribed    And if due proof of settlement, cultivation  and cm
zeue,hip, as heteni leqened be not made within------year t ext
after the expiration of sai 1 five years the said land shail again
be subject to entiyat pnvatesale, as land belonging to the
United btates
The*>e references to ihe lecords of Congress prove, it seems
to me that the members fiom Massachusetts are rot instructed
m this question, md that they may well continue to vote upon,
it as they have done, accorthng to their own individual con
virlions and with mutual respect and forbearance fox each1
other i leedom of opinion
Sir I agrée with the gentleman fiom Virginia, [Mr Robsrt
