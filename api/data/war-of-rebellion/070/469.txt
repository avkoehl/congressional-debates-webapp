across the Potomac had just given way, and he found the other would also go. He had not time before the bridge gave way to get the regiment off ordered to Baltimore. Fiver more Ohio regiments bound for Washington have just passed this point, but will necessarily be delayed at Harper's Ferry until the water falls, so that the pontoon can be relied or the bridge repaired.

Major-General SIGEL:

The following telegram just received:

CHARLESTON, May 15, 1864.

General KELLEY:

The latest reliable news was on the 6th, when he passed through Princeton. I have sent a scouting party to find his whereabouts.

R. YOUART,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

I have nothing of importance to communicate. All quiet along the line. We have had heavy rains in the mountains. Rivers and other streams very high. The bridges on the railroads have been in great danger from high water. We now think the danger passed. The cavalry have not been able to recross to Virginia, but the water is now falling. Hope to get them over to-morrow to Springfield.

This cavalry command is made up of detachments from the Twenty-second Pennsylvania, Fifteenth New York, and Twenty-first New York. Some of the companies of the Fifteenth are without a commissioned officer. Would it not be well to order the Fifteenth and Twenty-first to join their commands, with you, and, send me the balance of the Twenty-second Pennsylvania? Most of this regiment is well acquainted with the South Branch and Lost River Valleys, and would, perhaps, render your command more efficient service by protecting your flank in the above-named valleys than any other position, besides rendering the railroad safe from guerrilla bands under McNeill, Harness, and others.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, May 16, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General SIGEL:

I sent the regiments to Harper's Ferry, as you desired; also two to Martinsburg. General Halleck ordered me to-day to send one of the regiments from Harper's Ferry to Baltimore to report to General Wallace. The two trestle spans of the railroad bridge at Harper's Ferry were swept away to-day by high water. I understand that a pontoon bridge at Falling Waters was also carried away. The river is now falling. I trust we will not lose any more bridges along line of railroad. The pontoon will be relaid at Harper's Ferry, and the railroad bridge repaired as soon as possible. Five Ohio regiments passed here to-day bound for Washington.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
