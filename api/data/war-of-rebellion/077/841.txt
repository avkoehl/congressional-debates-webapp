Finding no enemy or no signs of one within ten miles, I halted and sent forward my scouts, who afterward reported to me that seven negro soldiers had appeared at Wilson's Ferry that morning, w ho, after being fired on by some stragglers, had retreated.

N. T. N. ROBINSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

When I arrived in Liberty I found you had left, and before leaving the town myself I received a dispatch (which I forwarded you) from Lieutenant Brown, my scout, who informed me that the enemy were retiring on Baton Rouge. A few moments after sending you the dispatch of Lieutenant Brown I received one from Lieutenant Leake, on the plank road, informing me that General Lee's cavalry from Baton Rouge only numbered 800 men. They came only as far as Williams' Bridge, some fourteen miles south of Clinton, sending 200 men into Clinton and 80 men in the direction of the railroad.
