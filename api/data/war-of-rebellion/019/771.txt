at Vienna." Their salt is obtained at Arkadelphia, in Arkansas, and Lake Houdon, in Louisiana, the latter a distance of 250 miles, and is $4 per bushel.

It may not be improper to state that large quantities of boots, quinine, and other articles find their way to the Confederates from Helena and Memphis, the former selling at $25 a pair, the latter at $20 an ounce.

I might add many other incidents, but will not trouble your patience longer.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. A. CAMERON,

Colonel Thirty-fourth Indiana Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS,October 30, 1862-9 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

General Ripley, in response to my requisition for arms, asks General Callender to procure separate requisition, to be examined by him and then sent to Washington. This will delay matters for months that ought to be accomplished immediately. Why not have a depot of arms here that I can put into men's hands who are idle for want of them? We do not destroy or squander arms. I only ask them for regular volunteers, and especially cavalry that has been, some of it, a year in service.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
