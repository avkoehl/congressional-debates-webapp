to Mary A. Davis, widow of William P. Davis,
a private in the eighteenth regiment of Indiana

amendment.

know that the proposition will be resisted, and
the matter will consume time.

dinate clerks for the allowance of this pension.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I object to the consider-
ation of this bill. I did not understand that

sent at this time to taking up that bill.
