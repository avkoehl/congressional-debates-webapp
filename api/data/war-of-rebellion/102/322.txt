WASHINGTON, D. C., May 5, 1865.

(Received 1. 40 p. m.)

Major-General POPE:

Gun manufacturers are applying for leave to sell guns and ammunition to the loyal people of Missouri under such military restrictions as may be deemed proper. Is there any objections to opening the trade to the sale of fire-arms ammunition, and under what restrictions, if any?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 5, 1865-3 p. m.

(Received 6. 45 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

There are no restrictions upon the sale of fire-arms or ammunition in Missouri. I removed all restrictions of the kind shortly after I took command here. Dealers in such articles are only required to keep a list of persons to whom arms are sold, with a description of arm, to prevent them from selling directly to bushwhackers. It is a mere form.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General POPE:

I have been detained here. I am not very well. Colonels Flournoy and Alston came for my dispatches to General Smith. Declined giving them. They will accompany me to Shreveport to-morrow. Smith sent them.

JOHN T. SPRAGUE,

Colonel, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,May 5, 1865-4. 20 p. m.

General DODGE:

Please do not allow any official reports about bushwhackers sent to your office to be published in the newspapers. I see one in the afternoon paper. Such publications are not of general importance and have no effect except to keep up excitement, which it is our object to keep down.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
