Colonel A. J. MACKAY,

Chief Quartermaster, Department of the Cumberland:

COLONEL: Yours of to-day has just been received. In view of the rapid rise of the river and the heavy rain now falling I do not think it advisable to turn either men or horses out of comfortable quarters. Nothing can cross at Waterloo now because of the backwater, and I only suggested Baker's Point in anticipation of the river falling soon, and thereby hoping to save time. As a matter of course, I will have any quantity of fuel that can be obtained prepared and furnished to the transports. I will send an order to General Long directing him to see to the matter at once, but if the river continues to rise I must confess I don't see how rails can be obtained in sufficient quantities. I am very sorry circumstances seem so much against us. The command is now ready to march whenever the weather will permit it or the river allow us to cross. I will send instructions to Captain Carling directing him to watch the river carefully, and make all arrangements to take advantage of the first opportunity to cross. Please hold the boats in readiness for our use. Have the boots and underclothing yet arrived?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Captain E. B. CARLING,

Chief Quartermaster, Cavalry Corps:

CAPTAIN: I send herewith a reply to Colonel Mackay.* Read it and forward. Please watch the river closely and advise me of the very first chance to cross it. Webster reports the Waterloo crossing impracticable. Nothing will move till the rain ceases and the river will allow it. Keep me posted in regard to the rapidity of the rise. Send to General Long for any detail you may require to furnish wood, and have all the boats supplied, so they can work when the time comes. You are also authorized to call upon Hatch for assistance. If this rain continues may we not get out of rations and forage the troops move from their present camps? You must try and devise means of landing supplies so they can be reached. Would it not be well to direct the construction of some scows by each division? Have the horses at Chickasaw and issue what are required by the four batteries. Turn balance over to Upton, Long, and Croxton in the order named. Want all of these divisions as nearly mounted as possible.

Very truly, yours,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
