Mr WILLI IMS explained the provisions cf
this oill. He sa'd it was introduced at the last se>,~

unfinished bus ness of the other House, and was
now again introduced, with il e intent on to fix and
determine the compensa ion to purser As no v
established, their compensation was fer y dollars a
Hionih, toge'her with crmn pnviliges aid per-
quisite, which w"c deemed to be extravagant
One great soar e of pre fir to purse-s was on arti-

a great evil, both to the service and to the eo ntry
This the present bill was intended to eff c , but it

the Treasury.
Mr. HUBBARD did not intend tl e to "ay any
thing m oppo iticn to thf bill, bu' t proposed to
fix the salaries of tí e pursers, and to pay them
from the Treasury, thereby ofectFig an entire
change in. the s; stem, they having been i nherto paid
in part by certain pe-qui itos If it went into
operation it would impose a very severe tax on the
Treasury; and therefore, especially as the Senate
was not tally attended, he hoped it « ould be-laid

Mr. HUBBARD said 1 e would call it up ?g m
on a future da\, if the Senator d*s red it, bit on
mature reflection he hoped t1 e &c nato- would not
make such a request
Mr BUCHANAN hoped *o too Thcr-vére

had insnrmountabl" objections he objected to the
Government becoming a merchant and gom; into

them out again to the ailor^ He wi> opposed to
such jobbn g, and he bel eved much of wh ch com-

putters to exhibit their invoices and allowing them
a moderate per centag  of profit on the cost of the
articles. He hoped tl e bill would be laid upon the
