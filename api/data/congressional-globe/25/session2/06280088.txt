and were constantly making, to represent the in-
tention to be to eiect palaces, and splendid edifices,
for these humble offices' He had no other answer
to give Co these mistakes than to present the estimates
ofthepioper department of the Government—of
that department which was charged by the bill
■with the erection of the buildings not only, but
■with the direction of the plans upon which they
were to be erected, thus showing, as perfectly as
mere intention can be shown, the views of the Go-
vernment as to the scale of extravagance or econo-
my designed by it in this pailicular, and to say
that Congress was the only branch of the Govern-
meat which could be looked to for the means to
make any erections whatsoever, and that its appro-
priations must measure the expense, and conse-
quently the extravagance or economy of the execu-
tors of the law.
The next, and only other item of expense, un-
der the bill, would be the pay of the officeis and
clerks employed. The numbei of additional offi-
cers whose appointments were provided for was
four, and he would assume that their combined
salaries would not be less than eight, nor more
than twelve, thousand dollars. They were to be
placed in responsible trusts, and ought to be citi-
zens of elevated standing and tried moral integrity
He could not suppose, theiefore, that any one
would wish to assign them salaries oi less than
two thousand dollars each, and he did not think
that the salary of any one of them should exceed
three thousand dollars For the sake of the argu
ment, he would call this expense twelve thousand
dollars.
It might be necessary to employ from six to
twelve additional clerks, under the various provi-
sions of ths bill Their combined pay might
amount to liom six to ten thousand dollars He
thought the estimate, both as to the number of
clerks, and as to the amount of compensation, verv
high Both, however, were his own, as he had
asked no estimate from the Depaitment upon this
point, and he was willing to assume the highest oí
his suppositions to be the true standard of expense
tor these two object*.
These last are regular annual expense"!, and aie,
therefore, lo be considered as the constant charge
upon the public Treasury of the system piopo-cd
The cost oí the ericlions is a single expense, w hich,
being once incurred and paid, is done with
What, then, aie the expei sis oi the folate bank
deposite system? If the deposites are open and
general, and the hanks have the use of the public
money as a coi ipersuion for then agency, the ex
pense is nothing, directly The use pays for the
keeping, as it most assuredly should when the mo-
ney is not, m fact, kept, but used He should
have occasion, h wever, very soon, to hint at the
indirect expenses to the United Stites of such a
system of bank deposites
But suppose a system of special deposites be es-
tablished, and the banks be effectually prohibited
fiom the use, for any purpose, of the money of the
people in their keeping, how then will stand the
question of expense? A commission upon the
money deposited must be paid to the bank foi its
trouble and risk. He was wholly unable to say
xvhat that commission ought to be, or what Con-
gress would be compelled to make it, to induce the
banks to accept the trust He had found, however,
from a comparison of various rates of commission
with the ordinary amounts of revenue collected
under the existing laws, and with the estimate of
the revenue for the current year, that one-eighth of
one per cent would amount to from twenty-five to
twenty-eight thousand dollars, as the constant and
current expenses of a special deposite system
How, then, stands the comparison? It had been
seen that the annual expenses of the system pro-
posed by the bill would, in the payment of officers
and clerks, vary from fourteen to twenty two thou-
sand dollars, and that the last would be the highest
amount to which those expenditures could rise
under that system, were Congress to adopt it as re-
ported by the committee The expenditures for
ejections might bi? added, if gentlprnen chose, and
the average made, upon any given number of years,
which, in the judgment of any member of the Se-
nate, would afford a fair trial to any financial sys-
tem, adapted to the opeiations of the National Trea-
sury , and conforming as strictly to the great mass
of private and corporate interests in the country, as
the constitutional powers of Congress would permit
that conloimation to be made He could not see,
therefore, that any system, formed upon the basis
of special deposites in banks, could, m point of ex-
pense, possess advantages over the bill under dis-
cussion He had not forgotten that that bill adopted
a partial sj stem of special deposites, and that it
contemplated a payment ot a commission to the
binks, « hich should keep the public money pursu-
ant to its piovisions, but he assumed that the diffe-
rence of amount in the above estímate for the re-
spective systems, was more than suthcient to cover
any commissions which a fair execution of the pro-
visions of the bill would call out of the public Trea-
sury, to be paid to the banks The most impoitant
points m the country, both as to the collection and
disbursement oi the public monej, were provided
for, mdt-pendentlj of the provisions for a special
deposite The commissions, thcrefoie, could be
made applicant to but a mere fiactton of the whole
rev enue, and, at any contemplated rate, the whole
amount could ncwi exceed a lew thousand dollars
He had made a it tíreme to the indirect ex-
penses ol an open and gtneial Slate bank deposite
s\ stem, win it the senilis andiisksot the banks
wiic compaisitcd by the use of the public money
Neid he, at tins lime, and in the present condition
o( the State banks, and of th public funds, define
his meaning m that reference? Why was the
special convocation of Congiess rendered njces-
saiy in September last? Was it not the nuspen-
sion ot the banks to pay specie for their paper,
and the consequent inability ol the public Treasury
to obtain from them, in any currsficy conform lble
to law, the millions of the public money entru ltd
to then safe-keepin<., and lequuedfot the cut ont
evpendituii'sollheüoveinmeiu? Noonewouldd ny
this position What the expensi to the people oi
the United States was, foi that smgk txtra sess on
oí Congrí ss, he had not taken the trouble to m-
iotm himself, hut this he would ventuie to assert
with perfect ( infidence, that thosi expenses mi re
than equalled the mom y required to carry on the
svstem ot fitnnce, proposed by the bill, for any
period ot ten vuits He would not now bring in-
to notiu the losses whuh might yet bi sustained
bek le the t xpeiiment of the late State bank dep >-
site system should be finally dosed He did n it
xvish to say any thing unfavoiable to the eventual
solvcnc), and siietv, and security of those institu
tions He did not wish to bring iny distrust upon
them Much less would he repeat, here, the dailv
rumor? of that portion of the public press which
most strenuously opposed this me isure, of the en-
tire failure of this and th it and tin other "pet
bank," of the sixty thousand dollars here,
and forty thousand dollars there, and un-
untold thousands soinevvhete else, lost to the peo-
ple, by this experiment trying Administration, m
consequence oí the employment of these State
banks as fiscal agents of the public Treasury.
Hi hoped and believed these pictures were over-
drawn, he was content to suppose, for the purpose
ol this argument, that not one dollar was to be
thus lost, and jet he ti usted hi had shown lhat the
system proposed by the bill, for the management
of the national fimnces, was more economical and
less expensive to the tax-paying public, than either
a sy stem of general or special State bank depositis
Ihvril His next point of comparison should be
the patronage conterred upon the executive branch
of the Government by the antagonist systems
It had bien already seen that the system piopo'ed
by the bill required the appointment ol four addi-
tional officers, with salaries of from two to thiee
thousand dollars This was a direct increase of
the Executive power and patronage, but when it
should be recollected how man) officers, with equal
salaries, ah eady existed, and with how much faci-
lity officers w ere added to that number, at almost
every session of Congiess, and m almost everyone
of the Executive departmen's, he must hope that
no uniiasonable alaim would Le felt in any quarter
of the house by ihis very limited addition to the
existing number If they were not to be constitu-
tionally appointed, or if, being so appointed, duties
were to be assigned to them not of a character
compatible with our civil and political institutions,
then the offices ought not to be created, or the du-
ties assigned, regardless of all consequences which
the rejection of the proposition might bring upon
the country. If, however, the appointments are to
be constitutionally made, and the duties of the
officers seem to be necessary to the public service,
he must be permitted to say that he reposed too
confidently upon the intelligence of the American
people, to suppose they would «ondemn the mea-
sure, because its details called for such an accession
of Executive strength tocariyout their wishes He
would not peimit himself so far to distrust the con-
fidence of our citizens m the Government of then
choice, as to believe that they would not feel per-
fectly sale in the decisions of Congress as to the
offices to be created, and in the Piesident and Se-
nate to select the persons to fill those offices
Was it, could it be, true, that a greater oi safer
tiust was to be placed in local banking mcoipora-
tions, than could be placed m the constituted
authonties of our Government, as organized under
the Constitution'' Were the tax-pa} mg citizens of
our Republic afraid lo entrust the safe-keeping of
the national treasure to officers of then own choice,
and responsible to them and to tha laws of Con-
gress, and anxious to confide it to b?rLs, not
created by national authority, o\rer vhich no
branch of the National Government had any con-
trol, and m the management of which neither the
people nor thtir Government had any voice? He
did not believe this was the state of public opinion
He did not believe that distrust towards onr
national audioriti s had jet gained this exttnt He
was not icady to admit that binks, such as our
Stale bmks now are, and with the recent expe-
liente of the danger of testing the operations of the
public Treasury upon them, were more the favorites
of the people of this country than then own xvell-
tiled and faithful sen ants
It was not his wish or design, he would íepcat
again, to say any thing unjust oi i vjunous to these
institutions Within then proper spheies tney were
convenient and useful, butiecent events had perfectly
satisfied his mind that they weie not the fit keepers
ol ihe treasure i r tieasury of a nation, that this
important incident to national independence ought
noi to be committed to the charge of institutions
who-e interests leaned so strongly towards a hazard-
ous misapplication of such a trust
Was it, could it have been, contemplated by
the framers of our system of Government, lhat thev
had provided no fit and trustworthy depositor} of
the national finances? That bai ks, incorporations,
pnvate incorporations, chartered for private uses,
owned by pnvite individuals, and managed by
persons responsible only to the stockholders, must
be called in to sustain the most deheate tiust undei
any Government? That the will of these institu-
tions must be consulted as to the terms upon which
they would consent to accept the trust, and that all
the authorities of the country, Congrsss itself in-
cluded, must cater with them for tetms upon which
the money of a tree people could be kept and paid
out, and as to the character of the currency which
eithei should be permitted to enjoy? Had proposi-
tions to this effect been submitted to tne convention
which framed the Constitution, what womd have
been their fate? Does any one believe they would
now have been found m that Constitution which is
the pride of freemen everywhere? Jso such de-
pendence upon such aid u ould have fou id no coun-
tenance there Can it find countenance in the Se-
nate now?
Could any one doubt, then, that tne peor'e's
monev should be confided to the people's servan's,
o iheir officers, responsible to them and to their
laws? and lhat the appointment of such and so
manj officers as should be found r>eceso«r\ to \ er-
form this trust m a manner safe and convenient to
the Treasur}, and to the people themseh es, was
not only in strict conformity with the Constitution,
and the very nature of our civil institutions, bnt
an imperious duty upon evei^ Congiessi He
could entertain no doubts upon either p ml
There was another direct grant of Executive pa-
tronage and power under the bill—the authority to
appoint the necessary clerks to perfoan the me-
