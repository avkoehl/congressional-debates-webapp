ENGINEER BUREAU,

July 26, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the honorable Secretary of War.

The greatest difficulty in making this connection will be the want of iron. I have just ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Meriwether to proceed to Montgomery, Ala., to assist in repairing the Montgomery and West Point Road, and to report upon practicability of making the connection between Columbus and Montgomery, via Union Springs. I have also ordered Captain L. P. Grant from Atlanta to Montgomery, to assist in pressing forward the work on the West Point road.

J. F. GILMER,

Major-General and Chief of Engineer Bureau.

JULY 23, 1864-4.10.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Where are the two brigades which you say are on my

right flank? The two regiments you sent me were taken away by General Iverson. I must have two regiments of cavalry at once for my left flank.

Respectfully,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS,July 23, 1864.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-General Hardee directs me to say that the three regiments under Colonel Hagan will be sufficient to protect his flank.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. L. BLACK,

Assistant Inspector-General.

JULY 23, 1864.

General WHEELER:

General hood wishes you to take what you think a sufficient force and pursue the raiding party you report as moving on the Covington road. You must leave a small force to observe General Hardee's right, and if necessary recall the brigade you were ordered to send to East Point.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
