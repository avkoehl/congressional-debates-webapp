Major John RAWLE,

Chief of Artillery, District of North Alabama:

MAJOR: Your communication asking for two guns, with ammunition and equipments complete, for the defense of Coosa bridge has been received and referred to Major Mccall, chief of ordnance, who shipped you this morning two 9-pounder Napoleon guns, with 260 rounds shell and 90 rounds canister for same, and directs that you make requisition for the equipments, which will be furnished at Selma. You will direct the officer who takes charge of these guns to exercise care and economy in the use of the ammunition, as no more can be had for this caliber of gun, and the guns will become useless so soon as the ammunition sent you is expended.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
