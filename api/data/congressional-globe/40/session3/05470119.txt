poorer is that which was hurled at us by every
copperhead orator, from Horatio Seymour
down, during the lastcanvass. Wealso encoun-
tered it in every rebel paper in the South, and
there were those who feared that it might pro-
duce an effect upon the popular mind. I was
not one of them. The American people are
intelligent enough to know when they have the
toothache, or are involved in a lawsuit, or are
being stripped of property through the medium
of a sheriff's sale, and remembering the disas-
ters of the last free-trade and hard-money era
of the country, I contrasted it with their present
condition and relied confidently upon their
judgment. In order to test the accuracy of my
memory and judgment on this point, I appealed
during the canvass to the statistics of my own
city, and among other telling facts found, as I
have already told you, that in 1860 the sheriff
of Philadelphia had received seventeen hundred
and forty writs for the sale of real estate, and
that in 1867 he had received but seven hundred
and six—a decrease of more than sixty per
cent., although the population of the city had
increased more than forty per cent. What
makes this fact more significant is, that under
our system of selling land under ground rents
the purchase of a homestead is the savings-
bank of the Philadelphia workingman. I also
ascertained the number of suits that were in-
stituted in the years 1857-68-59 and 1865-66
and 1807, respectively, in our local courts. The
evidence from this source is not less significant
than any that has preceded it. The court of
common pleas is emphatically the poor man's
court. It obtains jurisdiction by appeal from the
judgments of magistrates, and the amount at
issue before its jury is for sums less than §100.
The result of my investigation showed that the
number of the suits brought in the latter years,
notwithstanding the increase of population
which had taken place, was but little more than
one half the number instituted in the former
period. The figures are as follows:

I am sure I do Mr. Wells no injustice when
I complain of his palpable negligence in omit-
ting,to appeal to such sources of information
as I have indicated, and attempting to deduce
general laws by which to guide onr legislation
irom the lame and impotent array of facts he
has digested. We pay him a salary which he
deems adequate. Ilia traveling expenses are
at the cost of the Treasury, and he is surrounded
by a competent clerical force, and that he
should have rested all his theories upon an
array of facts so meager and so easily disproved
is, to say the least, not creditable to hisindustry
or judgment.
The gentleman from Ohio told 11s that hear-
ing of my intended attack he had asked in-
formation from two sources in order to test the
correctness of the Commissioner's position*
That was an idle waste of time. Had he
spent it in examining Mr. Wells's figures, he
would have discovered from their own man-
ifest incongruity'that no two or two hundred au-
thorities could give them a character for respect-
ability or the weight of authority. The gen-
tleman is an arithmetician and knows that
5111,000 are not twenty-one and forty-nine
hundredths per cent, of $5,164,500, and that
$37,000 are not seven and twenty-six hun-
dredths per cent, of $5,053,500. Yet the Com-
missioner tells us they are, and so impairs the
value of the important table on page 111 of
the report. I invite the gentleman's attention
to the two elaborate tables to be found on
page 16 of the report, the first purporting to
show in parallel columns the " average weekly
expenditures for provisions, house-rent," &e.;
the second, " average weekly earnings," and
the third, " surplus for clothing, housekeeping
goods," <fcc., of families in 1867 ; the other
in corresponding columns purporting to show
"average weekly expenditure of families of
varying numbers in the manufacturing towns
of the United States for the years 1860 and
1867, respectively."
More remarkable tables than these never
were prepared by statistician. I had supposed
that Mr. Delmar, late chief of the Bureau of
Statistics, was a paragon in his way; but he
must look out for his honors, for in these
tables the Special Commissioner of Revenue
has beaten him roundly in his own depart-
ment. Unhappy Delmar! Happy Commis-
sioner Wells! For Delmar's report Congress
had nothing but an indignant vote requiring
its suppression, though it lay ready printed
and bound; but for Wells's budget of more
egregious blunders it has such admiration and
approval that no love of economy could restrain
it from voting to print it for the widest possi-
ble circulation. The tables to which I refer
must speak for themselves, for no man can
describe or characterize them. As evidence
of the want of care with which the report has
been sent to the country I call attention to the
fact that one column of figures which ought to
be iu the latter table has been omitted and
that another appears twice. It is so in both
editions. The tables are as follows:

I hope the gentleman from Ohio will give
these tables a reasonable amount of consider-
ation, and if he still thinks they may be correct
refer them to another authority—the ancient
matrons of his district. Bnt before making
this reference I beg him to advise the ladies
of the fact that he draws his question from an
official document; for if he fails to take this
precaution they will hold him guilty of per-
petrating a practical joke at their expense by
submitting to their judgment so absurd a prop-
osition. They will doubtless be able to tell him
that parents with two children cannot live so
well on the same money as parents with but
one, and that as a general rule it costs more to
maintain parents and three children than is
required for the support of those with but two
or one, and that the same is true with refer-
ence to parents and four children : but they will
probably doubt his sincerity in asking whether
parents with five children can live just as
well on less money than is required to sup-
port in the same communities parents with
butthree, and will laugh at the proposition that
parents with six children can live as well on
less money than parents with but two ; and I
thinklhear them crying out, " Why, sir, what
do you mean by asking us whether parents
with six children can live for less than parents
with two, and yet in the same breath telling us
that if they happen to have a seventh, be it boy
or girl, it will more than double the expenses of
the whole family ? Unwelcome seventh child!
According to Wells you come into the family of
every laboring man to double the household ex-
penses, though all your six predecessors be still
sheltered by the paternal roof! Lucky children
numbers five and six .'—henceforth you will be
welcomed everywhere; for the Special Com-
missioner of Kevenue has proved that in all
instances your coming reduces the expenses
of the family to less than they were when the
household flock consisted of but two! Accord-
ing to the Commissioner this law of social life,
hitherto undiscovered, is absolute, and pre-
vailed alike in 1860 aud 1867.
To invite attention to those tables is to subject
them to ridicule; and yet, Mr. Chairman, they
are the foundation-stone and the keystone of
Mr. Wells' s entire structure; upon them he rests
all his argument, aud from them he deduced
his conclusion, so disparaging to the Republican
