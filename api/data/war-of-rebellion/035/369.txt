Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., May 28, 1863-10.58 p. m.

Secretary STANTON:

Our best advices to-night show that one brigade of McCown's division had started south, but returned last Thursday. The rest of their troops are in position, except Breckinridge's, which moved or went south. Doubt about their going south arises from the appearance yesterday of a brigade of infantry near Bradyville, 11 miles hence, said to be [Joseph B.] Palmer's, which we know to be one of Breckinridge's. Forrest has gone with no large force, if at all. Reports from Corinth to-day say that all the cavalry on the cavalry on the Tennessee had been ordered to Columbia, 40 miles southeast from here; that Roddey crossed the Tennessee at Florence
