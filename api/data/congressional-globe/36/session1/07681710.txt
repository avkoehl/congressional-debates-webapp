THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 13,
The question was stated to the House, and the
Speaker announced that it seemed to be decided
in the negative.
Mr. BRANCH. I think the House does not
understand the question. This is simply a mo-
tion to lay on the table the motion to reconsider.
Mr. HOUSTON. I suppose everybody will
understand my purpose in making the motion. It
is to provide for the bill remaining in committee,
where it can be discussed. It involves a principle
that ought to be examined into; and that is all I
want. I do not want it brought back into the
House by a motion to reconsider, and put through
under the operation of the previous question,
withotjt the opportunity upon the part of any
member to ask any question, or express any opin-
ion upon the subject.
Mr. DAVIDSON. And everybody knows that
if it goes to the Committee of the Whole, without
the power to bring it back by a motion to recon-
sider, it can never be rcached.
Mr. DUELL. The bill was befor# fho last
Congress,and passed this House,as I understand,
almost unanimously. I presume every member
is familiar witlytt.
Mr. BRANCH. I will say that the motion is
simply to confirm the action of the House in re-
ferring the matter to the Committee of the Whole,
on the motion of the gentleman who reported it to
the House. 1 do not know what objection can be
made to it:
The motion to lay the motion to reconsider.on
the table was agreed to.

Mr. DAVIDSON, from the Committee on En-
rolled Bills, reported that the committee had ex-
amined, and found truly enrolled, an act (H. R.
No. 31) for the relief of Charles Knap; when the
Speaker signed the same.
HALF PAY TO "WIDOWS AND ORPHANS-
Mr. IIUTCHINS. I will say that there are
some thirty-odd bills from the Committee of
Claims, involvingprecisely the same principle as

objection to the passage of the bill at this time.
It is a just claim; which will be admitted, I think,
when the bill is road. I ask that the bill be read.
The Clerk read the bill. It authorizes and di-
rects the Secretary of the Interior to cancel bounty
land warrant No. 31474, issued on the 10th of

rendered as a seaman in the United States Navy

Mr. TRIMBLE. It is a case of mistake of
name, and the bill only provides the proper cor-
rection.

in order at this time.

about this case, and I must object.
