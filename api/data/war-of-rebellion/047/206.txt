force on Sullivan's Island, it would be well to throw there an additional regiment from James Island, where at present so large a force is scarcely required.

I am further instructed by the commanding general to suggest that the reliefs at Morris Island might remain three days instead of forty-eight hours, as previously arranged, the men taking with them the required number of cooked rations.

He also thinks it advisable to send to-day to Fort Wagner one 8-inch columbiad or 32-pounder rifle, to replace the one exploded. It should be mounted to-night, if practicable, on account of its moral effect on the garrison.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
