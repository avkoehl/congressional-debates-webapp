HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

August 11, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two deserters from the enemy have just been forwarded - one from the Tenth Florida, Finegan's brigade, Mahone's division, Hill's corps; the other from the First Confederate Battalion, Davis' brigade, Heth's division, Hill's corps. As far as their knowledge extends there has been no change in the position of the enemy's four divisions now on the south side of the Appomattox in the last three or four days. Richmond papers of yesterday had official reports of the evacuation of Fort Powell, in Mobile Harbor, which was blown up by the enemy before falling into our hands. They have no other information of any importance.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: The following dispatch is respectfully forwarded:

JORDAN HOUSE STATION.

There has been a movement of cavalry this p. m. with twenty-five wagons and ambulances. They came out of Petersburg in direction of Richmond. It is impossible to tell the number, as they were not well closed up, but think about two small regiments.

CLARK,

Signal Officer.

The station at the Walthall house reports the same movement.

Very respectfully,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.

Respectfully forwarded to Lieutenant-General Grant.

GEO. G. MEADE,
