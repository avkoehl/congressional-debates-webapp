mean tobe understood ü>atany of them, «strictly speak" n*, were
insolvent, or that they coull not ultimately pay all th*1 r debts
He had refenedto the Dry Dock Bank:, which was p ced by
the Chancellor in the hands of re eiveis, ind to the heavy
looses sustained bv many of the banks m the late levukim
By refeience to the Tieasury report, it would be ¡been ih u one
ol the city banks alone had tweive hundied thuiisand dollars of
suspended debt, yet even that bank would in a f w years
restore its capital to its original amount by its collections and
profits He had meiely intended to express the opit vm that
the actuil capitals, of many oí the banks nil been din inched
during the revulsion He begged to be undeistood as enter
tainmg no hostile feelings towaids the gentlemen mtejp-ted in
these institutions nor to banks, as the mere agents oi trade
but to that legislation which is perpetually and imp op rly
mteifering with this as well as other branches of tiade His
hostility was exclusively directed to this mischievous  md coi
luptins interference with the business of men, which was not
among the legitimate duties of Government "
Mr Duncan and Mr WHiTTrEsBY of Ohio, a'so sai 1 a few
words in mutual explanation, but m no way vaiying th state
ment oí last evenng as to the peifect solvency of the Ohio
banks 1
Mr Dawson resumed, by saying that it was not at I is own
eo icitation the House adjourned last evening for ho would
willingly have concluded his remaiks then, much as he le
gre te 1 the unplea. ant necessity oi bitting at such unseat mable
hours
M D continued Mi Speaker, I si all a^ain resume the
subject, and shall endeavoi to ronfin> m> remaiks clo ely to
the matter we ire investigating     With your peirm&biai, su,
I will just repeat the subbtance of what I stated last m^ht It
was, that the Secietaiy o! the rieasuiy had announced to the
Am ncan people that the Treasuiy ofthe countiy wat- now full
offjnds, but that they were nor available that he ai-kel Con
gress to be supplied with ©10,000,000 to eairy on tlef.o\ein
ment, and that this application to the discretion of Const t s
the chanman of the Commifee of Ways and Means h id ron
firmed, and also asked a similai amount foi the Government
Now, air, I assume thi= position—foi I desue this mattei well
imdeistood, since I stand alone heie from the ¡state I have the
honor in part, t > iPpieseut I then i=ik sn what is to bc done
with the unavailable funds, if we make this appropi ation of
$10,000,000 required of us? The response will be, the only
response tan he, that they mustrunam— wheic Í In the dt-po
site banks If then, sn, they aie to be imivailable o the
Government—and I wish the question to be I urly understood
li the Government can go on without these un ivai! ihlt nmds,
whateirthiy necessity, what e Hilly advantage will it deuve
horn the pisiponement of the fomth instalment? They tell
you they do not desue any pouion ol it, they do not wish to
use one single dollar oi itj in the event of yout giantm.; the sum
of -flOOOOOOD Then, mr, tin* postponement of the fom Inn
stal ment will not even be requm d hy the Government 1 hen,

Have you tiicd them, sn? It is mged tint vou fannot divuk
the m ney among the Sutes, because u is uiiavuldbk Sn,
there is, m my view, no difficulty upon this bunch of the
question at all, and why? Becaube the deposite law of l^fi
requites the lundsin the Ireasuiy on the 1st of Tmuaiv, 1837,
to be deposited with the Statts and, wheihei the monty be

Specie oid<.r, in payment of the public 1 indb md then d sho

to examine the Specie circular, and inquire into the means by
whi.h it was evaded, and why it failed, and how ufad d, m de
positing specie in the bank? hutl will not at this time,b cause t
would be foreign to the subjectl piopose to investigate But, sir, I
will a k, have gentlemen fully examined the piofits ami adv  nta
ges that will be deuved to the deposite banks from this in hilgence
if it should begranted? If so, then I will ask them will they
do injustice to the other banks of the countiy, and especially to
the deposite bank* which have honestly and faithfully A balled
all their engagemt nts-? Have gentlemen made tins <xamma
tiorfi Have you examined into the fact that you aie holding
out a piemium paying a íeward, and doing an actoi injustice
to o hers, in oidei to provide for the rebel o thtse whu have
\iolated their faith and broken their en^ia'emerfs'? Have°en
tlemen taken into their caiculatons the enormous conn ist bt
tween the conduct of the banks m some of the Stitesand that
othei s? Do they know that the dci osito bank*, of tin "state of
Mit, issippi have in their vaults, oi on deposite lather ttpwaids
of seventeen hundred thousand dollars belonging to the Govern

halfi the States of Alabama and Ohio each ovei a million'1
Have gentlemen asked themselves the question, is not this mo
nej pledged7—is not this monev ordered to be deposed with
the States? I will read to the House a very short statement,
showing the contrast between the amount of public money de
ported in some of the ¡states with that in others'1

an unequal disti lbution of the public money
Mi Speakei, I as this House cotne to the conclusion to take
the fourth instalment awav fiom thebtates'i and foi whaf* lo
leave it in the hands of those who have it, and three oi fom
States have one half of the whole deposites of the countiy' Is
this to be only a postponement Mr Speaker? I apprehend
not, sir I apprehend it wdl be indefinite Yet this is cal led a
measure of relief It is partial relief— lehef of one class at the
expense of another Sir, there is not one single principle in
the whole piopotition founded anon a patriotic view of the
subject, or consistent with equality among the States It is
doing more than justice to one, and withholding it altogethei
fiomotheis It i& narrow and contiacted legislation, to benefit
and relieve corporations at the expense of the honest people o*
this countiy I am not opposed to the banking oí me cantile
interest, on the contrary, I am willing that íehef should be ex
tended to every interest, but the deposite banksand meichan ■ ,
having been vilely abu-ed, it is to mike some little atonement
to them, that these bills foi their exclusive benefit, (I alindo
now to the bills extending indulgences,) are to be passed, at tho
expense of every other intciest
Well, sir pie&urmng all these bill? pass, I return to my eon
stituents, and they ask me what I have done for them what
shall I answei? Sh ill I answer m the language oí the gentle
man from Ohio1* Shall I say to them, Oh, ves' we have
been most nobly and patriotic illy engaged We have felt youi
oppression, we have sympathized in your thstiesseb, we have
seen the difficulties biought upon you by the Government, we
have mourned ovei your situation and we have almost wept
tears for youi afflictions' Well whtt have you done? Why,
we havepa^ed a bill to lehtve the Government, by authorizing
the Secietaiy oftheTreasury to issue ten millions of Treasury
notes Verywe'l, whatelse? We have pissed a bill to relieve
the importing merchants Well, what else1 Why, we have
passed a bi I to relieve the pet banks from the pi) ment of the
public money deposited with them Well, but what have
you done for us? Nothing, sirs, nothing, nothing at all '
That will be the answer, Then, « , will they teply, You have
leheved the officeis of the Government? Oh yes, we did that
And you have mduleed the banks? Yes What' indulgedthose
very banks which General Jackson denounced, in such strong
term as having violatt d then faith and being no longei woi thy
of the slightest confidence'* Yes Why did you do it? Now,
«ir, how can I íeply to that* I tell you, sn, theie will be a
burst of feeling among the people on this subiect, and this
Administration have mistaken their grourd, if they imagine
th°ir acts will meet with approbation It is all a mistake, cir
And why is it a mis ake? Beeause it is not right Because it
is not just Because it is not doing equal justice to all, but is
benefiting one class and section of the country at the expense
and to the wrong of otheis My constituents will ask me,
Where is the fourth instalment we were to have liadí What
have you done with it"*- Why I must íeply, gentlemen, tli 1
you not see the President^ Messise, where it wasiecommended
that \ou must postpone it'' Did you not leal the iepoit ofthe
Secretary o tlip Tieasmv, wheiem he said it was wrorgto pay
it, and it must be left with him that is in the ban s And do
you not know that he and the President both were against youi
having it from the beainmngi Well they reply, VYhat ha^e
you done with it? You passed a bill to issue ten or twehe
millions of Treasiny notes    That was for the relief of the
o\errment What have you done with our money—our
fourth instalment Oh' we left that with the bank* left it
wi h the banks' Why, who told you to do that? Why Mr
Van Buren and hts Secretary, and the chanman of the Com
mi tee of Ways and Means'   [A general smile ]
Mr Speaker, I have not drawn this pit tin e to excite laugh
ter No, sn It is a melancholy uuth I insist upon it sir
that this whole machine, this entire system, ís^i. violation ofthe
iischts and equal justice of this countiv And, say the people,
>ou havp left the whole of our suiplu« monej in the banks
wtil in w1 at States aie the banks? Why, they are ovei m

in Indiana and in Ohio and m Michig in, chieflv None n
Geoi n* No Sn, these ate all veiy I aid questions, wl ich
will be pit * nte 1 bv mv constituents to me when 1 letnrn, and
the only answei I can erne is that I stated to the Speaker, I
stiff d to Congiess mv objections to this bill l pon ted out this
inequality, and theie was not a man in the House dared to deny
H  and yet i' wan all of no use
But, Mr Speaker lam not going to contend for the power of
this Congiess to leheve the distresses of thepeople, for I donor
beheve m tho constitutional potvtr of this House to raise money
to give to the people I only believe m a parental icgard this
House should have for the wants ofthe people and, if any
means can lit devise 1, within our constitutional limits, that
they should he And we have themeans of constitutional aid,
ami ill we want is he inclination and the spirit to come up and
d i ii in spite ofany mandates te the contraiy come from what
quutei they may That is ili, «sn That it> the only thing
nece sary for its to do Uninfluenced by paity, us the it
piesentatives ofthe people, and of them alone, let us do what
wt  can
Wei1 sir what can yon do? Wh>, yon can pay the fourth
instalment which you phghted your faith to pay But, it is
said ihat the dept site will not be received m the only mode by
whi h th G iveinment can pa> it Sir, is there a gentleman
