Memphis, June 10, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to inform the Department that I am preparing an expedition to go up White and the Arkansas Rivers in pursuit of the few remaining rebel gunboats, of which one only, the Van Dorn, that escaped on the 6th, is formidable.

I received this morning a telegraphic message from General Halleck, urging me to open communication with General Curtis by way of Jacksonport. I shall therefore alter the original design of the expedition so far as to limit it to the waters of White River so long as its presence may be necessary to give gunboat to General Curtis.

Memphis, Tenn., June 19, 1862.

The gunboat Conestoga, returning from White River, reports the capture of two batteries, mounting seven guns, at Saint Charles, 80 miles from the mouth. The attack was commenced by Captain Kilty, in the gunboat, who silenced the first battery. The second battery was gallantly carried by Colonel G. N. Fitch, at the head of the Forty-sixth Indiana Volunteers. A shot caused the explosion of the steam drum of the Mound City, by which the greater part of her officers and crew were killed or wounded. I write by to-day's mail.

C. H. DAVIS,

Flag-Officer.
