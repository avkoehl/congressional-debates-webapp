BROOKS' HEADQUARTERS,

June 23, 1864

Colonel SHAFFER:

I was not complaining about Colonel Abbot's being taken away, only of the manner in which it was done. All General Foster's movements have been made by virtue of orders received by him direct from department headquarters. General Weitzel and he have reported back direct. I have no authority over him.

BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 23, 1864.

General BROOKS:

All the orders to General Foster from these headquarters were made by General Weitzel and exclusively in regard to engineering. If any others have gone it was an oversight and will not happen again.
