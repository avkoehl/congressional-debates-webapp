THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. WILSON. In order to accommodate the
Senator from California, I yield Â£o him until to-
morrow morning. *
Mr, GWIN. I move that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of the Pacific railroad bill.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. In yielding, as I do, that
- the railroad bill shall be taken up as the business to
be disposed of by the Senate, first in order, I de-
sire to call the attention of the Senate to the first
special order upon the Calendar, and to give no-
tice, that as soon as the railroad bill shall be dis-
posed of, I shall move that that special order and
the subjects which are connected with it may be
taken up and disposed of. I refer to the ease of
Commodore Paulding. It is well known that
Commodore Paulding is prosecuted in the courts
of the United States, in the city of New York,
that suits are pending against him, involving
large amounts of property, and that it is neces-
sary that that matter should be acted upon at an
early day, that the Government may justify the
course of Commodore Paulding, and defend him
against those prosecutions. I yield, however, to
the motion of the Senator from California.
MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.

by Mr. Allen, its Clerk, announced that the

PACIFIC RAILROAD.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
bill (S. No. 65) to authorize the President of the
United States to contract for the transportation of
the mails, troops, seamen, munitions of war,
Army and Navy supplies, and all other Govern-
ment service, by railroad, from the Missouri river
to San Francisco, in the State of California, the
pending question being on theamendment of Mr.
Bigler as amended.
Mr.GREEN. I propose to amend that amend-
ment in the twenty-first line of the sixth section,
by adding after the words 4< Postmaster General,"
the words " when he shall deem it proper." If. is
to be added to that provision which requires the
Postmaster General, when twenty-five miles only
of the road shall be completed, to have the mails
carried on it at the ruling rate. It seems to me
that ought to be left to the discretion of the Pres-
ident.  
Mr. GWIN. There is no objection to that.
The amendment to the amendment was agreed
to.
Mr. GREEN. I have another small amend-
ment to propose; in the twenty-fifth line of the
same section, to strike out after the word " regu-
larly," the rest of that section, and insert, "de-
ducted from the amount loaned by the United
Slates." It provides now that compensation shall
be paid for the service this road may perform for
the use of the Government, and that this compen-
sation " shall be regularly paid fi om the Treasury
of the United States quarterly, or at such times as
may be agreed upon." My amendment will make
it, shall be regularly deducted from the amount
loaned by the United States."
j The amendment to the amendment was agreed
to; and the question recurring on the amendment
fif Mr. BiGLERsas amended, it was adopted, as
oilows:
Strike out the fourth, fifth,sixth, seventh, and
eighth sections of the original bill, and insert in
lieu thereof:

Mr, WARD. I move to amend the bill in the
first section by striking out the words " from a
point on the Missouri river, between the mouths
of the Big Sioux and Kansas rivers, to San Fran-
cisco, in the State of California, on the" most eli-
gible route, reference being had to feasibility,
shortness, and economy;'* and inserting, in lieu
thereof: > -
From some point between the forty-ninth and thirty-
second parallel? of north latitude, to the nearest eligible
point on the Pacific coast, in the State of California, refer-
ence being had to feasibility, shortness, and economy.
Mr. SEBASTIAN. I wish to submit to the
Chair, before the vote is taken on that proposi-
tion, a question of order as to whether, after the
Senate adopts a motion to strike out and insert,
it is in order to move to strike out the matter in-
serted and insert other words.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Stuart
in the chair.) The Chair will inform the Senator
that it would not be. If a motion to strike out
and insert prevails, it will prevent a subsequent
motion to strike out any part of ihe matter in-
serted.
Mr, SEBASTIAN. Is it competent for me,
then, to move a division of the question?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not di-
visible. The Senator may move to amend it.
Mr. SEBASTIAN. I have given notice of an
amendment which, at the proper time, I intended
to bring-before the Senate. It is not my object to
discuss the merits of it at all; but I ask the Sec-
retary to read it; and I move to insert the sub-
stance of my amendment in lieu of the provision
proposed to be inserted by the amendment which
has just been moved I'propose it as an amend-
ment to the amendment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Secretary
will read the amendmentproposed by the Senator
from Arkansas.
The Secretary read it. It is to strike out the
woids " from a point on the Missouri river be-
tween the mouths of the Big Sioux and Kansas
rivers," and insert, "from Fort Smith, on the
western boundary of the State of Arkansas."
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
is on the amendment of the Senator from Ark-
ansas to the amendment of the Senator from
Mr. SEBASTIAN and Mr. SEWARD called
for the yeas and nays; and they were ordered.
Mr. GWIN. Is that an amendment to the
amendment of the Senator from Texas?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir.
Mr. GWIN. If that is voted in, then it will
come up afterwards for final decision.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
will still be on the amendment as amended.
The question being taken by yeas and nays, re-
sultedâyeas 3, nays 48; as follows:
YEASâMessrs. Brown, Mallory, Sebastianâ3.
NAYSâMessrs. Alien, t aicÂ«, Bell, Benjamin, Bigler,
Bright, Bidder it k. Chandler, Clmk, Clay. Chngman, Oolla-
irrer, Davis, Dixon. Doolittle, Doujiia*. Durkee, Fessenden,
Fitch, FitvspatricU, Foot, Foster, Gieen.Gwin, Hale,Ham-
lin, Hailan, Houston, fver-on. Johnson or Tennessee,
Jones, Kir.p, Polk, Pupli, R<iid, Rice, Seward, Shields, Sim-
moii*, tfhdell, Stuart, Thomson of New Jeisey, Trumbull,
Wade, Ward, Wilson, Wriglu, and iTuleeââ 4S.
Mr. Johnson, of Arkansas, had paired off with
Mr. Bayard.
So the amendment to the amendment was re-
jected; and the question recurred on the amend-
ment offered by Mr. Ward.
Mr. HOUSTON. I move to amend the amend-
ment by striking out "thirty-two," npd inserting
" thirty."
Mr. SEWARD. I ask for the yeas and nays.
[" No!" " No!'*] Why no' have the yeas and
nays? I want them simply lor the reason that!
think so important a vote as this should stand
forever; and i wan-t to record my vote.
