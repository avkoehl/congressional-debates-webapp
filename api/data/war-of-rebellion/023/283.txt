General NEGLEY, Columbia:

Two hundred men Kennett's cavalry go to Nashville on train

to-morrow for horses. They are ordered to come back by way of Kinderhook. An officer will stop to see you, and get information and concert plan to destroy guerrillas there. Don't detain Kennett's cavalry longer than necessary for this one scout.

General NELSON, McMinnville:

(General Smith to forward from Manchester.)

Hazen's brigade cannot leave Murfreesborough at present. The Twenty-third Kentucky and Thirty-first Indiana are ordered to join you. There is another regiment absent from one of the brigade now with you. Where is it? The general wants you to report on the state of affairs in your vicinity, and if you should want

re-enforcements apply to him, as he can tell points from which they can be best spared.

(Telegraphed to Manchester and to be promptly forwarded from there in duplicate by two different couriers.)

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 7, 1862.

General WILLIAMS S. SMITH, Tullahoma:

If you are uncertain about the innocence of deserters send them to commanding officer at Nashville. If you feel certain they are innocent, keep them a while and let them to the interior. There is great danger of their joining guerrilla bands.

A dispatch is just sent to be forward to General Nelson. See to it.
