Grove. Each division is to be supported, if necessary, by the corps to which it belongs. Though it is tow hours since the troops started we have not yet heard a cannon. The present indications are that the rebels are beyond the Chickahominy.

TWO MILES WEST OF HAW'S SHOP,

May 30, 1864-1 p.m. (Received 11.45 p.m., 31st.)

The general reconnaissance reported in my dispatch of 2 p.m. yesterday found the enemy in force on Mechanicsville road south of Totopotomoy Creek, and between that stream and this place, but there were no signs of him toward Hanover Court-House. This discovery was made at too late an hour in the afternoon for any extensive movement upon his lines. This morning, however, Wright has been brought down upon the Hanover Court-House and Richmond roads, and Hancock and Warren have been sent forward, with Burnside close upon the rear of the two latter. As yet there has been no fighting beyond that of skirmishers and advance batteries. Hancock has taken some prisoners, who report that Lee's whole army is here, but it still remains doubtful whether his main force is north or south of the Chickahominy; that point will probably be seated before dark. General Grant means to fight here if there is a fair chance, but he will not run his head against heavy works. We shall at any rate remain here through to-morrow, in order to give time for Wilson, who is ordered with his cavalry to destroy railroad bridges over Little River and the South Anna, and to break up both railroads from these rivers to this point.

NEAR HAW'S SHOP, May 30, 1864-8 p.m. (Received 7.45 p.m., 31st.)

In the course of the afternoon Warren has pushed down on our left until his flank division, under Crawford, reached a point abreast of Shady Grove. Crawford having got detached from the rest of the corps was attacked and crowded back a little. The enemy then threw a force, which appears to have consisted of Ewell's corps, upon Warren's left, attempting to turn it, but was repulsed. The engagement was short, sharp, and decisive. Warren holds his ground at a distance of 7 1/2 miles from Richmond. He reports that he has taken a considerable number of prisoners, and that there are many rebel dead on the field. Of his own losses he has not yet made a report. His latest dispatch says that the enemy are moving troops to his left, apparently to cover the approach to Richmond in that direction. On our right an active conflict has been raging ever since dark, but has just closed. As soon as the enemy attacked the left of Warren, Wright and Hancock were ordered to pitch in, but do not seem to have got ready until after nightfall. No report has yet been received from them.

Secretary of War.
