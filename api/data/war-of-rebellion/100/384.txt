Lieutenant Colonel THEODORE COX,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Twenty-third Army Corps:

The Third Division train will go under escort of a regiment which Genearl Carter may detail, and it can start when the rest of the division does. I have sent word by Doctor Frink as to headquarters. If railroad transportation can't be given for the Third Division in two or three days let two brigade march with the train and the Second Brigade come by rail as fast as possible. The pontoon train is not intended to come here at present, but get directions on that subject from General Schofield.

J. D. COX,

Major-General.
