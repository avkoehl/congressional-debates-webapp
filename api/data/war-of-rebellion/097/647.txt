HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 8, 1865-8.30 a. m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

The commanding general has received your dispatch by Major Rosencrantz. He desires you to move promptly and to take the same road as Major-General Humphreys toward Appomattox Court-House. The necessity for the corps being united makes it preferable to have you move on this known road, unless you know that you can move parallel with General humphreys and keep up communication with him.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 8, 1865.

Major-General WRIGHT:

A communication from General Humphreys gives information that a flag of truce has just been received from Fitzhugh Lee asking whether or not the flag from our side interrupted operations to-day. The reply was "no." This presence of Lee would indicate that an attack upon our trains is to be guarded against. You will therefore cover your rear by a suitable guard.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S.-General Meade directs that you send a brigade back to Farmville to guard supply train until relieved by General Parke.

A. S. W.
