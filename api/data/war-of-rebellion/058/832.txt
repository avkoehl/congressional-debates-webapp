apprised of my presence in the country.

I think the fleet will go down hte river to-night. Reports reach me that the enemy are moving up the railroad toward Goodman. If I find such is the case, I will move in that direction in the morning. My teams and horses are all broken down, and must be rested or abandoned soon.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Captain MOORMAN,Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Since my last dispatch of 3.15 p. m. yesterday, in which I informed you that the enemy failed to reach the city with their gun-boats and had retired to put off heir infantry, two gun-boats returned about 4.30 p. m. and attempted to shell my troops out of position. Failing to do so they retired again, and my scouts reports that the transports and gun-boats moved off down the river several miles and are out of sight. My men were posted in the breast-works around the city yesterday, dismounted, to fight their infantry, but they would not "come to time," but after maneuvering awhile,as if they intended to attack, retired again to their boats. They have been re-enforced, I am satisfied, with at least one regiment, as two transports ran by Liverpool night before last, coming up. The Sixth Texas Regiment lined the banks and fired heavy volleys into them as they passed. They are very timid since being so badly whipped at Liverpool, and I am confident of whipping them again if they land and fight me here. I have a fine position, and if I only had another section of artillery to post at Liverpool I could capture every transport that attempted to pass.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
