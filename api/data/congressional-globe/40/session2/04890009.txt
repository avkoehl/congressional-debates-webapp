manent regular establishment.
quartermaster general.
The Quartermaster General submits full
financial statement and analysis of accounts
for fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, showing
that during the past year 11,180 accounts have
been examined, amounting to $309,738,171 89,
and of accounts remaining to be examined
1,544, amounting to $47,451,262 74.
Sixteen thousand and eighty-six horses and
mules were purchased during the year for the
public service.
The sales of surplus or unserviceable ani-
mals during the year amount to $268,572 24.
The total sales of this character since the
close of active hostilities in 1865 amount to
$16,245,710 4C>.
The supply of clothing and equipage is so
large that no purchases of these articles will
be necessary for the next year.
The amount of clothing and equipage issued
under the act of Congress approved July 14,
1806, to families rendered houseless and desti-
tute by the recent conflagration in Portland,
Maine, is fully sot forth in report.
The fund of $1,000,000, known as the shel-
tering fund for the troops on the plains, has
been applied to the purposes for which it was
intended.
One thousand temporary buildings have been
sold during the year for the sum of $112,000.
The erection of the fire-proof warehouse in
Philadelphia is in process of construction. The
contract price for building is $138,800. It will
probably be ready for occupancy in December
next.
The United States not owning any land at
or near the city of Jcfforsonville, Indiana, and
no appropriation having been made to purchase
land as a site for the buildings, no steps have
been taken to execute the provisions of the
fourth section of the act of Congress approved
February 2, 1867, authorizing the erection of
fire-proof buildings at that place.
There are 308 cemeteries in the United States
in which are interred the bodies of United
States soldiers. Eighty-one of these are known
as "national cemeteries." The total number
of United States soldiers interred in ceme-
teries is 251,827, of which 238,666 are interred
in the national cemeteries. Seventy-six thou-
sand two hundred and sixty-three bodies are
yet to be interred in these cemeteries, which,
when completed, will make the total number
828,090. Twenty thousand eight hundred
and sixty-one rebel prisoners of war have
been interred. The estimated cost for fencing
the cemeteries is $709,000. The amount
already expended on cemeteries is estimated
at $1,737,000. The total cost of the cemeteries,
when completed, is estimated at $3,500,000.
On July 1, 1866, the southern railroads were
indebted to the Government to the amount of
$6,570,074 05. June 30, 1867, this amount
was reduced to $5,921,372 10.
The number of troops and the quantity of
supplies transported up to the 20th September
were as follows: passengers, 73,196; animals,
7,194; public freight, 306,570 tons, at a cost
of 4,048,000.
Daring the fiscal year there were presented
24,417 claims, amounting to $13,924,764 10,
of which—
5,408 claims were approved, amounting
to....... $5,440,041 48
6,51<5 claims were not allowed, amount-
ing to  3,613,866 99
12,40b claims are awaiting action,
amounting to  4,870,855 63
$13,934,764 10
On the 1st of July, 1866, the organization of
the department consisted of 67 officers and 12
military storekeepers, total 79. By the act
approved July 28, 1866, the department was
reorganized, and now consists of 76 officers and
16 military storekeepers with the rank of cap-
tain, making a total of 92. Five assistant
quartermasters general have been retired. The
number of volunteer officers in the department
has been reduced from 107 to 81. Those
remaining at the close of the year were fully
employed upon important duties.
It is found that the number of officers of the
quartermasters' department as authorized by
the act of July 28, 1866, is insufficient to the
prompt performance of the duties devolving
upon them; it is therefore respectfully recom-
mended that a portion of section thirteen of
the act approved July 28, 1860, be repealed,
and that there be added to the quartermasters'
department so many assistant quartermasters
with the rank, pay, and emoluments of captains
of cavalry as will raise the number of officers
of that grade to fifty; and that the vacancies
thereby created in the grade of assistant quar-
termaster shall be filled by selection from those
persons who have rendered meritorious ser-
vices in the military service of the United
States as assistant quartermasters of volunteers
in the late war.
All of the officers of the department are
highly commended for the able, conscientious,
and faithful manner in which they have all
discharged the highly important duties devolv-
ing upon them in the various details of busi-
ness pertaining to the department.
commissary general.
The Commissary General of Subsistence
reports that during the past year subsistence
stores for the Army have been pioeured in the
usual manner, by advertising for proposals in
the larger markets of the country. Efforts
have been made with considerable success to
obtain supplies from the producers and dealers
established near the point of consumption.
The completion and extension of the Union
Pacific railroad already afford great facilities
for reaching and supplying distant occupied
posts heretofore supplied by trains of wagons
at special seasons of the year. Recent reports
from the military division of the Pacific give
assurances of success in the efforts to supply
the troops of that division with pork made on
the coast. This article has heretofore been
shipped from New York. Tobacco has been
supplied to the enlisted men of the Army under
the sixth section of the act of March 3, 1865,
to the amount of $101,895 84. Subsistence to
the amount of $882,684 66 has been furnished
by this department for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1867, to freedmen and others under
the proper and authorized demands of the
officers and agents of the Bureau of Refugees,
Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. The total
cost of subsistence stores issued or transferred
for the subsistence of Indians for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1867, is $644,439 22.
The number of claims presented and paid under
public resolution No. 56, approved July 25,
1866, up to September 12, 1SC7, was 2,069,
and amounted to $116,187 75. The number
presented and passed for payment under sec-
tion three of the act of March 2, 1867, was five,
and amounted to $259 50.
The total number of claims received under
the third section of the act approved July 4,
1864, is 4,920, amounting to $2,493,257 45;
of which number there have been examined
and approved 482, amounting to §146,149 51;
examined and rejected, 1,881, amounting to
$1,071,194 42; leaving for final action and
decision 2,563, amounting to 81,275,913 32.
The number of claims examined and decided
since the last annual report is 1,190, amounting
to $480,436 00; of which number there have
been approved 248, amounting to $60,806 41;
rejected, 942, amounting to $419,630 19.
The officers of the department have all per-
formed their duties with zeal and ability.
All of the commissaries of subsistence of
volunteers have now been mustered out except
two, who are by authority of law on duty in
the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Aban-
doned Lands.
No appropriation having been made to meet
the large expenditure's necessary to .carry put
the provisions of section twenty-five of the act
approved July 28, 1866, an order was issued
permitting sutlers to continue to trade 'With
troops until further orders. " • •
The law authorizingthe appmntmenfcof com-
missaries of subsistence having expired,' it is
suggested that it be recommended to Congress
to authorize the General commandingthe Army
to appoint from the lieutenants of the line, dn
the recommendation of the Commissary Gen-
eral of Subsistence, as many assistant commis-
saries of subsistence as the service may require,
not to exceed thirty-two, such officers to be
paid twenty dollars a month in addition to their
proper pay and emoluments, but without loss
of the fourth ration, and to hold their appoint-
ment until canceled by their promotion to the
grade of captain or by order of the General.'
It is also suggested that it would be highly
beneficial to the service could thero be author-
ized n, grade of non-commissioned officers to
be called post commissary sergeants, to be
selected and appointed as are ordnance ser-
geants, and to have the same rank, pay, and
emoluments—the number not to exceed one to
each military post.
The recommendation of the Commissary
General for the appointment of thirty-two as-
sistant commissaries is approved. It is abso-
lutely necessary that there should be, and there
is, an officer acting as commissary at every post
garrisoned by troops. The only bonded offi-
cers to act in such capacity are the officers of
the subsistence department and the regimental
quartermasters. The same bond should be
required from assistant commissaries as is
required to be given by the latter. The addi-
tional pay would only be allowed when the duty
of assistant commissary was performed, and
they would never perform that duty at a post
of less than a full regiment when there was
present either a commissary or a regimental
quartermaster.
I would recommend that no appropriation
be made to execute the requirements of section
twenty-five of the act of Congress entitled "An
act to increase and fix the military peace estab-
lishment of the United States," and that public
resolution of Congress No. 33, approved March
30, 1867, as promulgated in the following
orders, be continued in force:

Washington, April 13,1867.
The following resolution of Congress is published
for the information and government of all concerned:

the oneliundredth meridian of longitude west from
Greenwich and the eastern boundary of the State of
California, wlion, in his judgment, such establish-
