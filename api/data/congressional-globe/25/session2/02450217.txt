naturally have risen again when the suspension,
(for all commercial purposes at home,) suddenly
«inverted eighty millions ot currency into mer-
chandize, and it ivas withdrawn from circulation.
The compound standard of specie and paper, by
which the property of the Union had been measur-
ed, was abruptly reduced from about one hundred
and ninety millions to one hundred and ten mil-
1 ons of a variously depreciated currency, or, if we
consider specie as the only common standard, from
a hundred and nmetj to eighty millions Foreign
exchanges rose, notw ithstandmg this extraordinary
reduction, and all the sanguine anticipations of a
revival of confidence and ctedit were disappointed
Our reduced ennency was still further diminished,
the term of om commercial embarrassments was
prolonged, and the revival of trade postponed to
an uncertain period These were the consequences
of that measure which it was supposed would re-
lieve the country
But, however we may suffer by the recent mis
pension, we must anticipate a similar event at
every revulsion It cannot be avoided in this age
of speculation, and with our system of banking
In periods of alarm, those who are threatened with
bankruptcy will seek relief m any measure, íe-
gardless of consequences The banks will cer-
tainly yield to the demands of trade m rome parts
of the Union, and the recollections of the run upon
them m 1837 will produce a panic which must
c impel most, if not all, othei banks to follow their
example Some portions oí the Union may possi-
bly escape, but we may certainly anticipate em-
barrassment in some sections, and we should ac-
cordingly prepare for it The banking sWem of
this country must be thoioughly reformed before
confidence in the convertibility of bank notes em
be permanently revived No such reform can, at
this time, be anticipated A lew more disastrous
revulsions may compel us, at some future period,
to correct the vices of our system , but, for the pre-
sent, it is evidert that our local currencies are to
be still further vitiated by State legislation Wnn
our recent experience, and with such a prospect
before Us, a just and patriotic regard for the public
interest urgently requires that the Treasury of the
United States should not be hereafter exposed to
embarrassment or bankruptcy by being connected
with a system liable at all times to explosion, and
that it should never again be made dependant upon
every vicissitude in the commercial system of the
world
The Federal Government is also bound to pre-
serve for the States the only measure of value re-
cognised by the Constitution, that the taxes and
disbursements of our Confederacy may be er llect 1
and paid out m a common medium If the pro-
posed measuie be rejected, we cannot hereafter
anticipate any uniformity in oui taxes, or any such
thin? as a federal currency With our complicated
banking system, the immense enlargement of com-
mercial credit, the rapid growth of the commeice of
the Southwestern States, and of the settlement of
the new States generally, we cannot preserve
eouahty in exchanges or local currencies Our
exchanges were as much deranged in 1825, while
we had a National Bank, as they were m 1837, and
our paper system would have exploded then, had
not that revulsion originated in Great Britain
The history of our cotton trade exhibits fluctuations
■which defy control The price periodically gives
way, the Southwestern States are deprived of a
large amount of their funds foi remittance, and our
exports are suddenly suspended. Such vicissitudes
must continue with the rapid growth oí the cultuie
and manufactuie of cotton, and with the enlarge-
ment of the paper systems of Great Britain and the
United Stales It is obvious that the power and the
mischiefs of our banking system are about to be
■come still more formidable, and there is too much
reason to apprehend, m a few years, an explosion
more distrous- to all branches of industry than
any we have hitherto felt While the States
continue to multiply banks authorized to sup-
ply the country with a currency, no effort
of the Federal Government, whether by incor-
porating a National Bank, or by a perpetual
issue of Treasury notes, could prevent a suspension
of specie payments, while either ef these measures
would but increase speculation and the violence of
revulsion The only alternative left for the Go-
vernment is to guard permanently against the
effect of such legislation, and of such explosions
upon the common medium of our Confederacy
Should we ever restore the agency of banks, or
permanently invest oui reienue in bank notes, we
shall be compelle4 at every suspension to issue
Treasury notes as a substitute for com, or to collect
ourievenues, and make our disbursements, m the
variously depreciated bank paper of the States,
contrary to e\ ei} rule of justice, and to the express
provisions of the Constitution Should such ever
become our policy, it would end m 'he entire de-
struction of the only uniform, permanent, and uni-
versal measure of value, and of the only whole-
some regulator of the trade and ciedit of the world
If, on the contiary, we wisely separate our Trea-
sury from the credit of om banks, we shall secure,
through all the vicissitudes of trade, and the fluc-
tuations of our local currencies, a common medium
for our tixes and disbursements, a uniform mea-
sure of \a!ue for the States, and a standard which
w ould tend to adjust more speedily, after every re-
vulsion, ttie temporary derangements m our ex-
changes and currencies
The public mind is satisfied that some plan should
be adopted lo relieve tiade from any connection
w ith our revemits and to render our Tieasury m-
depcndenl of all explosions Numcions plans have
been proposed for making a partial use of banKs,
foi the mere purpose of keeping the public money,
under some special deposite sjsten, with an obli-
ga! ion not to employ it in loans to trade No such
depos te can be effectual but one which secures to
the Tk asury the control over the money specially
deposited, and leaves the cbilj receipts and paj-
ments to be made by public officers Sucha sjstem
would merely secuie the use of th  vaults of the
banks as places oí safety, and would be unnscessa-
íy wheie our public offices are supplied, as they
all must be, with vaults or safes, or both, for the
preservation of the public archives and treasure
If the banks ha\e control over the public money
deposited with them, all the stipulations and obliga-
tions which can be contrived will never pievent
them from discounting upon it, directly or indirect-
ly and all the ¡.uarels we can provide will not se-
cute to tin Tu isny i s specie fund incase of a
suspension The \anous regulations vInch have
been pr< posed would be, in prael ce, meie nullities
The obligation to credit the revenue collected,
as specie, has ilwa}s existed, and would be
and moie binding hereafter than it has been here
tofore, and a special depo ite, exclusively controlled
by the bank, would be as unavailable in case of a
suspen on as any other, which it would be equally
bound in 1 uv to pay m specie A s ipulation that
the bank slia'l pav the Tieasury wairant m specie
would be abortive, as th?t must be determined by
the Government creditoi Whether the deposites
are in specie or in bank notes, it will pay out its
own notes, and increase ifs discounts accordingly
Periodical settlements w ith banks having control
ovei the deposites, befoie and after the settlement,
would be d mere formality Banks might be em-
polyed under a system ot joint management and
control Special collections, deposites, and dis-
buisetnents might be made under the care of two
sets of orneéis one to be appointed by Govern-
ment, the other by the banks, but such a plan w ould
require a much greater number of officers than is
now proposed, and would, at the same time, ena-
ble the banks employed by the Treasury to sub-
stitute their notes for the com collected, and enlarge
then issues and their discounts, which is one of the
principal e\ils designed to be avoided bj thesepa-
íauon.
The Treasuiy cannot, with safety to itself or to
trade, part with its control ovei the public money,
from its collection to i s disbursement After ex-
amining th" subject in all Us bearings, and with
every desire to unite public sentiment in some mea-
sure, the committee are more than ever convinced
that the simpler, most economical, and best plan,
for all interests, as a permanent system, is to em-
ploy officers of Government, appointed by the Pre-
sident with the approbation of the Senate, to col-
lect, keep, and disburse the public money, under
such regulations, guards, and restrictions as Con-
gress may from time to time deem expedient. Va-
rious objections have been made to this plan which
deserve consideration Some apprehend that, if
not now, it will ultimately require a large addition
to the number of officers in t íe public service, and
so far increase Executive patronage This appre-
hension seems founded on a mistaken idea of the
duties of oui public officers, as they have existed
from the commencement of the Government All
the essential duties of receiving, keeping, and dis-
bursing the public money have always been, and
are now, peifonned by them, and the proposed
measure might be carried into effect without the
addition of a -ingle officer, but for the special de-
positories proposed for greater security The mo-
ney for cash duties and public lands has always
been collected by our own officers, and placed in
banks, m the first instance, to their own credit, or
kept m their own hands Prior to 1800 all the
custom house bonds w ere co'lected at our cus-
tom houses, and some are ¡. ill so But even
wh n collected b} L inks, which w as a mere
Treasury regulation, the amoi it was carried to
the ciedit of the collectors, and not to ihe eredit of
the Treasurer of the United States Our receivers
and collectors have alwa} s had, w íe ner banks
were employed or not, the absolute con'rol, for a
time, of the who e of our revenue from customs
and public lands amount rig, since 1781), to more
than $1,053,000 000 The only change now pro-
posed is, that our office is shall not hereafter trans-
fer the monej to banks to be loaned out, but that
they shall keep it and pay it over directly to the
ordei of the Treasuiy It will certainly be more
convenient to pa\ it at their own offices than to
tiansfer it, as b ietoforc, tj deposite banks The
same officers will continue to be empiojed in dis-
charging the same duties generally throughrut the
Union, without any addition to their mmber At
seven points of collection the duties and responsi-
bilities will be increased by the b 11 proposed, and
in these cases alone can pny further a d be re-
quired
For the greater seou ity of the public revenue, it
is pioposed to establish seven special depositories
Having a Treasurer of the United States at the-
seat of Government, it is obviously more proper
th"t the publif money collected wnhm this District
and us neighborhood should be placed in his custo-
dy for public use, than tha' if should be, as hereto-
fore, deposited in banks to be employed in loans
It is proposed that this officer shall take charge
of and pay over, for pubbc purposes only, all mo-
ney which may be collected w thin this District, or
which ma> otnermse come into 1 * hands
As we ha\e n i ts at Philadelphia ard New Or-
leans, with eierv provis on for the security of the
public money, it is pioposed that tae cash collec-
tions at the custom houses m these places should be
transferred daily, and the bonds for duties weekly,
to these depositories Tiie duties of receiving,
keeping and paying over the public money, are not
new to the treasure)s of the mints The Treasury
is authorized to emplOj a million oi dollars m
facilitating the coinage which is constai t'y passing
through their hands Thpj also perform the same
duties for banks and meich mts The duties oi the
treasurers wiH not be changed in character, but
their receipts and pajments for Government will
be moderate]} increased in „ nount
We have now officers employed m our custom-
houses to collect the cash duties The officer at
New York received at that custom-house, m 1836,
five millions of dollars As there are to be special
depositories at Boston, New York, and Charles-
ton, with increased responsibi' ties, it is proposed
to substitute, in their places, at these ports, officers
of a higher grade, to be denominated "public re-
cen ess," and as a s milar depository is proposed at
St Louis, an offiea of the same grad , in lmu of
toe receiver now there These officers and the
treasurers of the tmrts will al o have charge ol
sums as may be transferred from other points
The increased labor and responsibility imposed on
the Treasurer of the United Sta^s, the treasurers
of the mints, and the public receivers, may require
further aid, the Secretary of the Treasury is therefore
authorized to  appoint two additional clerks   for
