T)   Federal Goveinmmt has detenoiated the era-
rerey, and carried mischief to the whole communi-
ty, and last its own revenues, and subjected itself
to be trampled upon by corporations, by departing
from the Consti'ution, and converting this Govern-
ment from a hard morey to a piper monev Go-
vernment The abject of the amendment and the
bill is to reform these abuses, and it is a re-
form worthy to be called a reformation—
worthy to engage the labor of patriots—worthy
to unite the exertions of different piities — worthy
io fix the altenlion cf the age—worthy to exeir lie
hopes ot tue peoplo, and to invoke upon its st, «ws
the blessings of ho t\ <?n
Great are the evils, political, pecuniar}, and mo-
ral, which have fio \ed fiom this departuie fiom
our Constitution Through the Federal Govern
m«it alone—througn it, not by it—two millions
and a half of money have been lost m the last four
months Thirtj-two millions of public money was
the amount m the deposite banks when they stop-
ped payment, of this sum twenty-fire millions have
been paid over to Government creditors, or trans-
ferred to the States But how paid, and how trans-
fened? In what? In real money, orits equivalent"!
Not at a!" But in ti e note^ of impended banks—
in notes dtp'ecnte 1, ( n an av erase, ten per emt
Here then wcie two i I ahalf md1 tni lost Who
bore the loss? The public creditor , ->nd (he Stales
Wh > g?med if—f( r where there is a loss to one,
there must be a gain to another Who gamed the
two and i half millions, th «s sunk upon the h"nds
of the creditor md the Slates? The banks were
the game s, ü ey gamed it the public creditors
and the Strtos lost it, and to the cted tors it
was a forced l(ss tt is m va n 10 say that they

Power ru'ed,and that power was in ihe banks, and

The Senate r from Nt w York, (M* Tallmadge,)

years, melt daig the war, and covering three gene-
lal sispcn ions     Leaving the people out of view,
as a field of losses beyond  calcu'ation, I confine
my elf to the  Federal Giver ment, ard say, its
lo ses 1 ave been enormous, prodigious, and wcal-
cubble     We have had three general stoppages of
the 1 >cal bin! s ii the short spac  of twenty-two
3 ears    It is af the average rate of one ui seven
yeai , and who is to guaranty   is  fiom another,
and from the  consequent losses, if we continue to
receive then bills id pavrrent of public dues   Ano-
hiei stoppage must come, and that, reasoning from
all analogies, m less than seven je?rs after the re-
sumption     Many mun perish m the at empt to re-
sume, and would do better to wind up at once, with-
out attempting to soon, without adequate means,
and against appalling obstacles       Another revul-
sion must come      Thus it  was after the last re-
sumption     The banks recommenced payments m
1817—m   two years, the fulures  were moie elis
astious  than ever      Thus   it   was m   England
ifter the long   suspension   of  twenty-six   vears
3avments   recommenced   in   1823—m   1825 the
nosi deflating crash of banks took plaee which
had ever been  known in the kingdom, although
the Bank of England had impoited, in less than
four years, twenty millions sterling in gold, about
one hundred  millions of dollars, to recommence
upon     Itk effects reached this country, ciushed
the cotton houses in New  Orleans, depressed the
monev market, and injured all business    Why w as
this?   Why was it that, within two years after re-
sumption, both m England and  in  our America,
these disastrous revulsions ensued''    Loss of confi-
dence   was the cause, and that loos resulting, not
from the act of Government but fiom the conduct
of t'-e binks themselves     The banks had fined,
and, Ihete'oie could f ii     The perp'e hid seen
them fall, and, theufore, they feared ihey mignt elo
so again    Theie was no confidence in them   no
wore than the coachman places in the balking horse
when he comes to the lull     The gentleman from
Vngima (Mr Rives) wishes the Government to do
something to reanimate confidence in these banks
Could -a law of Congress inspire confidence into hi
coachman, and give him faith m the balking horse'
No more can it be done in relation to these banks
They have stopped, universally and simultaneously,
in a season of profound peace and general prospe-
rity—no war no pestilence, no famine—with four
times as etch specie in the country as evei was in
ii  befoie, and tl is stoppage his killed confidence
It is dead by the act of the banks, and cinnot be
legislated into existence again by <k% of Congiess
Confidence  is a plant of   voluntary, and not of
forced cviste-ice     It is said by an eminent man to
be a plint of slow giow th     We all kno v it lo be
so, anel we know, besides, that when this plant is
once pulled up  bv the roots, it rarely tikes loot
again in the sa no phce
The Senators from New York and Virsrima
(Messrs Tallmadge and Rives) push this point of
confidence a htile "further they address a question
to me, and ask ff I would lose confidence in all
steamboats, and have them ill discarded, if one or
two b'ew up in the Mississippi? I answer the
question m ill frankness, and siy that I should
not But if, instead oí one or two in t le Mr-si sippi
all the steimboats in the Union should blow up at
once-—m every creek, nvei and bay—vhile all
the pissergers were sleeping in confidence and
the pilo's ciying out ill is well, if the whole
should bl< n up fiom one end of the Union to the
\ o'ner just as last as thffj could hear each others ex-
p osions , then indeed, I srould lose confidence in
them, and nevei igun tiust line, or child ortnj
own foot, oi aii thing not ínlcndcdfor desttuc'ion,
on board such sympathetic ind contagious engines
ofdenh I answer fmIher and tell the gentlemen,
th i it only one or two banks hid stopped last Miv
in New Yoik, I snould not have lost all Cfmfidence
in the rem mm? nine hundred and ninety-nine,
but when ihe whole thousand stopped at once, turn
bled down togethei—fell in a lump—lie theie—and
when ONE of their number, by a sign with the lit-
do finger, can mal e the whole lie still, then, in-
deed, confidence is gone'   And this ib the case
w ith the bink^ They have not only ¿topped alto-
gether, but in a sea«on of profound peace, with
eighty millions of speeie in the country, and just
after the annual e\am,nitions by commissioners
and legis'alive committee s, and when all was re-
ported veil With eighty millions m the country,
they stop even for change1 It did not tike a na-
tional calamity—a wai—to stop them1 They fell
in time of peace and prospenty1 We read of peo-
ple in the West Indies, md m South America, who
rebuild their cities on the sime^spot where earth-
quakes had ovenhiown ihem, we are astonished at
their fatuity, we wonder that they will build again
on the same pei iloas foundations But these peo-
ple h ive a reason for their conduct, it is, that their
cities are only destroyed by earthquakes, it takes
an earthquake lo destroy them, and w hen there is
no earthquake, they are sife But suppose their
cities fell down without any commotion m the
eaith, or the air—fell in a season of perfect calm
and serenity—ind after that the survivors should
go to building again in the same plaee, would not
all the woild say that they were demented, and
weie doomed to destiuctioni So of the Govern-
ment of the United Stitcs by these banks If it
continues to use them, and to receive their notes for
revenue, after what has happened, and in the face
of what now e? ists, it argues fatuity, and a doom
to destruction
Resume when they w ill, or when they shall, and
the longci it is delayed the worse foi themselves,
the epoch of resumption is to be a perilous crisis to
many This stopping and resuming by banks, is
the real zation of the poelicil description of the
descent into hell, and the return from it Facths
descensus Jlverni—sed i evocm " gi adum—-hie opus, h%c
hem est Easy is the descent into the regions be-
low, but to return ' this is worl this is labor
indeed' Our banks have mide the descent, they
hive gone dow n w fh °ase 1 ut to re urn—to ascend
the rigged st ps, ind behold i¿am the light above,
how many will faltei, and fill back into the gloomy
regions below
The day of resumption will be a dav of pent,
and of death to many It is a penalty which their
extraordinary stoppage has imposed Many must
fail in the trial, piobably a new panic and piessure
take place, and those who must attribute every ca-
lamity to the misrule, the ignorance, and the mis-
government of the republican party, had as well
be pteparmg their accusations m advance, for the
contingency will come, anda erase for it must be
found in the misconduct of the Government Let
them prophetize m advance, and show their capa-
city for political divination by vaticinating before-
hand, and exhibiting now a political cause for an
event to arise hereafter out of the natural progress
of banking
Banks of circulation are banks of hazard and of
failure It is an incident of their nilure Those
w ithout circulation rarely fail That of Venice
has stood seven hundred years, those of Hamburg,
Amsterdam, and others have s ood for centuries
The Bank of England, the great mother of banks
of circulation, besides an ictuil stoppage of a quar-
tet of a centuiy, lies hid her crisis and convulsion
in avenge periods of seven oi eight y ears, for the
hst half century—in 1783,'93 '37, 1814,'19,'25,
'36—ind has only been saved from rep ated failure
by the powerful support of the Butish Govern-
ment a id profuse supplies of exchequer bills Hei
nimeioos p t geny of pnv ate and joint stock banks
of en dilation have h*td the same convulsions, and
not be ng supported by the Government, have sunk
by hvndrcds at a time All the banks of the Unit-
ed States are banks of cncuhtion they ait all sub-
ject to the inherent dingers of that class of banks,
and iro, besides, subjec* to new dangers peculiar
to themseives From the quintify of their stock
held by foreigner, the quantity of o'her stocks m
their hands, and the current foieign balance against
the United States, oni paper system his become an
appendage to that of England <Vs such, it suffers
fiom sympathy when the English system suffers
In addition to this a new doctrine is now broached
—that our first duty is to foreigners' and, upon this
principle, when the banks of the two countries are
in peril, ours aie to be sacuficed to save those Qf
England1
