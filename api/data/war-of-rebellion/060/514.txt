Major- General DEDGWICK,

Army of the Potomac:

General Butler again asks for a demonstration by your army. Give him such co- operation as you can, and communicate directly with him. All available forces here have been sent to West Virginia.

H. W. HALLECK,

General- in Chief.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 5, 1864- 1. 45 p. m. (Received 2. 10 p. m.)

Major- General HALLECK,

General- in- Chief:

Your dispatch is received. I will co- operate with General Butler as far as I can by vigorous demonstrations, and take advantage of such chances as may occur. A flank movement with this army is impossible in the present condition of the roads and state of the weather. Demonstrations in our front at the present time amy, however, spoil the chances for the future.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major- General.

PONY MOUNTAIN, February 5, 1864- 4 p. m.

Captain NORTON:

A small column of smoke southeast by east from here, distant 5 miles south from Germanna Ford, has been seen irregularly for two hours this p. m. Also, west by north another column, distant 12 miles, has been existing since noon, more regular. I judge them brush- burning. No change at the fords. Batteries still in position.

PAINE.
