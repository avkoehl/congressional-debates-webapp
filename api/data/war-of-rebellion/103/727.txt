I have just learned from General Thomas that you command the cavalry from his army. The first operation of your command will be to break up as far as practicable the railroad communication with Mobile west of the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers. The time of moment will depend upon the arrival of A. J. Smith's infantry and the state of preparation in which it is found when it arrives. Make your preparations to move as lightly and rapidly as possible, living to the fullest extent upon the country you pass through. The time of movement and general object to be accomplish will be indicated hereafter. A corresponding movement against the Mobile and Montgomery road will be made from a point on the Gulf, and General Thomas will be requested to attack the attention of the enemy to the northward by a demonstration from Eastport.
