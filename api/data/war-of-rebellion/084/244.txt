Captain M. U. FOSTER,

Holden:

On the arrival of the train to-night you will increase the escort with all the force that can be spared from Holden, the escort to be not less than seventy-five men. Assume command yourself and move the train to Pleasant Hill to-night. Leave the train there and move in the morning from Pleasant Hill with your command and all the men that can be spared from that station. Try and find and attack Todd, who is represented to have quite a force between that place and Independence. In case you do not find the enemy you will return to Pleasant Hill to-morrow night and move on with the train to Hickman Mills. There may be a force moving on Todd from the north. Be careful in passing the Blue. Acknowledge the receipt of this and state how many men you can take.
