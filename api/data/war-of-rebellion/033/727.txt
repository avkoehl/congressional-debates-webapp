CAMP FIFTEEN MILES EAST OF DONIPHAN,

December 1, 1863.

General FISK:

I arrived here last evening, and find, from reliable information, that there is no force at Doniphan, nor has there been. I have reliable information, however, of a squad of rebels, numbering 90, supposed to be in command of Reves and Sickles. They had a dismounted howitzer with them, carrying it in an ambulance. They were seen 30 miles west of Poplar Bluff, making for Ash Hill Wednesday night, to concentrate, day before yesterday, at about 10 a. m. I shall start for the Ash Hill in a few minutes, and shall reach there to-night.

SAML. MONTGOMERY,

Major.

FORT SMITH, ARK., December 1, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The train General Blunt brought through from Fort Scott is here-248 [wagons], by this morning's report. All not repairing are in use collecting wheat and corn for grinding, carrying stores to troops in the field, or collecting forage. The post quartermaster has 60 more wagons in forage and feed business. I have sent no train to Little Rock, because I have neither been able to get wagons from the quartermaster nor supply mounted guard. There is a train within 80 miles, on the Line road, which, when it arrives, I expect to have transportation so that I can draw on Little Rock for supplies. The Fourteenth Kansas Cavalry are with it. The train to Little Rock should start each month, and be 200 wagons, each with a strong guard. We make no requisition on Fort Scott, but have no Springfield. I did not report on McDonald stock, as the provost-marshal found it only an ordinary stock of merchandise. My personal observations confirm this report. The ostensible parties are McDonald and Brooks. General Blunt has not returned to Fort Leavenworth. He is acting under authority of the War Department
