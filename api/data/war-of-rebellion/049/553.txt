Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 9, 1863-3 p.m.

(Received 3.43 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief:

I respectfully request that I may be informed whether it is probable I shall receive instructions which would render it improper for me to grant leaves of absence to officers and furloughs to soldiers in limited numbers and for brief periods. I am confident that the granting of such leaves and furloughs would have a most beneficial effect upon the army, but in ignorance of your views and those of the Government, I now restrict leaves and furloughs to cases of great urgency.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 10, 1863-9.30 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

General Orders, No. 383, November 30, of War Department, gives the authority which you ask.

The enemy was busy erecting quarters all day. No working parties seen in the intrenchments. The vicinity of Morton's Ford appears better fortified than ever before. Can see several pieces in position there. At 4 p.m. the enemy's pickets at Morton's and Stringfellow's Fords were relieved by one company each. Observed picket fires to-day from Clark's Ford to a point 5 miles above Humes', on Robertson's River.

HALSTED,

Signal Officer.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,
