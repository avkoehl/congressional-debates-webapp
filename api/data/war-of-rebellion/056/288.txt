or Ripley. Johnson's whole force, 10,000 or 12,000. I still think their design is on Tennessee River. I am looking for some of my scouts in every minute.

CORINTH, November 30, 1863. (Received 4 p.m.)

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Scout sent by General Dodge four weeks ago to Rome and Atlanta, Ga., returned this morning. He reports that Bragg commenced moving back to Atlanta his ordnance and ordnance stores two weeks ago to-day, and was hurrying everything back as rapidly as possible. Scout was near Atlanta last Friday week; reports that Lee with heavy force had started from Okolona on raid against railroad; that Roddey with his command is between Burnsville and Tuscumbia, on both sides of Bear Creek. No further news from Mizner.

CORINTH, November 30, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Scout in from Ripley reports enemy in strong force at Ripley, with additional troops under Forrest west of that point.

Thinks the design at present is to make attack to Pocahontas. Have you any additional news from Chattanooga?

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, November 30, 1863. (Received December 1.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

I have no reliable information of the movement of infantry. I dispatched you some days ago that a deserter stated that French's division of infantry was being brought to Meridian. I also learned from a rebel source that there was to be an infantry support to Forrest's movement, but have no other information on the subject.

If Joe Johnston is bringing up Loring's and French's divisions with the cavalry column, my judgement is that Corinth goes up. In such an event I want instructions. I can, by a movement in time, save the command here by moving to the river.

You must direct what is to be done. Of course it will involve the destruction of all heavy guns and stores at the post, but this would be better than finally to lose the command.

JNumbers D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
