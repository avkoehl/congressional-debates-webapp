<g this Union, with perhaps one or two exceptions.
If theie are any exceptions I am not aware of
them. And, Mr. Speaker, if she is indebted to any
cause under heaven for her advancement in pros-
perity, wealth, and civilization, it is to her lofty
mountains and her beautiful and fertile valleys.
Her people breathe the mountain air, the air of
heaven and of liberty; and her rugged surface, not
barren and sterile, calls for their menial as well as
physical powers, and makes them what they are—a
hardy, vigorous, intelligent, and energetic people—
a people, sir, schooled in industry, morals, and vir-
tue, lovers óf justice and equality, and Democratic
because ihey are the lovers of justice. Such is the
outline of the character of New Hampshire and of
her people.
I will now. sir, descend to particular?, and show
what New Hampshire is, by contrasting her with
Tennessee, from which State the gentleman has
the honor to come. And here I would apologize
to the colleagues of that gentleman for the notice
I am, in defence of my own, obliged to take of
that State, if the contrast which I shall exhibit
wi1! cause them pain.
I begin with the geographical condition of the two
States. New Hampshire embraces in her territory
9,491 square miles. Tennessee has a territory of
45,600. New Hampshire is billy and mountain-
ous, and so is Tennessee. New Hampshire is
well watered by rivers and numerous smaller
strearrs. Such is the character of Tennessee.
New Hampshire has a population of 234,574, being
about 30 inhabitants to everv square mile. Ten-
nessee has a population of 829,810, being about 18
to each square mile. The gentleman says New
Hampshire has advanced but very little in popula-
tion during the last ten years, if she has not retro-
graded. Now, sir, the fact is shown by the late
census to be, that she has advanced in population
more rapidly in proporlion to her census in 1830
than a majority of Ihe old Stales, and even more
rapidly than the district represented by the gentle-
man frnm Tenne?«ee. New Hampshire, on a po-
pulation of 284,574, havicg increased 14,848, be-
ing a ration ot 5 per cent, and (bat gentleman's
district, on a population of 31,819, having in-
creased only 1,380, being a ratio of 4 per cent. So
much, sir, for the geographical character and po-
pulation of New Hampshire.
I will now take the agricultural statistics of the two
States, as famished by the la'e censes. New
Hampshire has a population, as I before remarked,
of 284,574. The aggregate value of her agricul-
tural products in the year 1840 was $25,703,000—
being §90 for each inhabitant. Tennessee c..«tains
a population of 829,810, black and v/hi'e, and pro-
duced in 1840, in the aggregate value, $73,130,000
of agricultural products—being $88 per head, and
two dollars less per head than is produced by ike
people of New Hampshire. Fast thi* fact, sir,
are we to infer that Tennessee is more barren and
sterile than New Hampshire, and thai she U a land
of "black chilly rock?," inhabited by the "screeching
owl" and the "pio wlmg wolf?" It would seem so from
the aggregate value of the agricultural productions
of the two States, compared their respective popu-
lations.
I will next contract the two Sta'es in the amount
of capital invested in four of the most important
branches of manufactures, and their annual produc-
tion, as exhibited by ihe census of 1840:
New Hampshire. Value of Marra fee/ures. Capital invested.
Cotton manufactures, $4,142,564 §5,525 200
Woollen       do.                  712,784            740,345
Leather        do.                  712 151            230,649
Hardware, cutlery, &c.      124,160                 —

Cotton manufacture?,
Woollen       do.
Leather        do.
Hardware, cutlery, &c
"^756^229          #643,380
Thus, sir, it appears that, m the four descrip-
tions of manufactures mentioned, New Hamp^hue
produces, in the aggregate, annually $5,775.599 in
value, and has invested a sapital of #6,495,194;
§5,744,599
325,719

359,050
57,170
56,495,194
463 240
25,600
154,540
while Tennessee produces only §756,229 in value,
and has a capita! invested of only $643.380. New
Hampshire, with a population of but little over
one third as large as Tennessee, produces in value
nine times as much in the four descriptions of ma-
nufactures I have named as Tennessee. And here,
in justice to the State of New Hampshire, I would
remark, that she has more capital invested in the
manufacture ef cotton than any other State in the
Union, except Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
And how proudly does she stand in contrast with
the State of Tennessee, which is in part represented
by the gentleman who has assailed her! Why, sir,
the State of Tennessee does not manufacture cotton
cloth enough to make each inhabitant a pair of
shirts a year; nor enough of woollen to give a quar-
ter of a yard to each of their backs! The gentle-
man ask?, " What has New Hampshire to trade
upon?" With how much force can I retort ¡he in-
quiry, " What has Tennessee to trade upon?" I
have, sir, a little knowledge of the commerce of
Bast Tennessee, the particular region from which
the learned and enlightened gentleman comes, to
whose attacks upon the State of New Hampshire I
am replying. Í am told, by a facetious gentleman
from the West, that, before the general introduc-
tion of steamboats upon the Mississippi, that no-
ble stream was navigated by flat bottom boats,
laden with the produce of the country, and that a
boat was always known to come from East Ten-
nessee, from the fart that it was laden with dogs
and hoop-poles. The gentleman can answer
whether or not those two commodities still consti-
tute the principal articles of commerce in East Ten-
nessee.
I will now call the attention of the House to the
líate of education in the two State?, which I shall
exhibit in contract:

Flow proud the contrast to every son of tie no-
ble little Granite State! And I will take this occs-
siun to remark, on the authority of the la'e census,
that no State in ihe Union has so rainy places of
instruction, and so many common schools, in pro-
portion to her p"pulalion, as New Hampshire—a
Stale which has been stigmatized zs the mosi be-
nighted, and as sunk in ignorance, by the vile and
dirty defamers of the Fedeial paiiy and press.
But Í have not done with the subject of education.
I will institute a comparison between the gentle-
man's district and my own.
The (':slnct represented by ihe gentleman from
Tenne-see fMr. Arnold] is composed of the coun-
ty of Greene, with a population of 16,076; Cr-
ier, 5 372; and Washington, 11,751: bring a total

The district of New Hampshire represented by
myself [Mr. Burke] is composed of the county of
Sullivan, with a population of 20,340, and Che-
shire, 25,429; being a total of 46.7C9; and con-

Thus it appears that ihe counties of Snllivan and
Cheshire, í,í New Hampshire, containing a popu-
lation of 46 769, have more than twice as many
academies, more than five times as many students
attending them, more that: twelve times as many
commtn schools, p,nd more than twen¡y-ñve times-
as many scholars attending them, as the díót.ict re-
presented by ihe geuileman from Tennessee, which
contain; a popolauon of 33,199. In ray district
there is but rne person over 20 j esrs cf pge in 778
who is unable t) read and *uite, and in that gen-
tleman's district there ií rne in ewry8%. The
town of Newport, in which I teside—a small
township of six miles square in Sullivan county,
containing a population of 1,958—hrs more than
half as many common schools as the district re-
presented by the gentleman from Tennessee, and
more scholars a'ter.ding them, there being 19 com-
mrn school? in ihe town, and 650 scio'ars attend-
ing them.
But the gentleman fays New Hampshire hasno-
fbing to trade upen but her publics. 1 admit, sir
that she cas driven a pic.ii.ious trade c piliiicf,
anr', like all honest and faiihU-1 .wctanis, -.he has
gained a ln?h chin-Cc for poh'icai ramals and in-
tegrity. Y -, sir, her poh'ical fann isco extensive
wilh the Vuim. S ernly and gloriously has she
stood by her principles i;: the daike.-t hour of trea-
son, treacheiy, t.-A á> lasion. &U has held the glo-
rious banner of liberty and Democracy alo:t when
it was stricken down in almost every State, and
when she was deserted on every side. But-, sir,
she has been ih* polar s'ar of the No: th, and again
h=s aetcd as the pioneer of her pal.'ant sisters, and
led them to victory and glory. Her history is fi-ii
of stern devotion to patriotism and Democracy.
Such, sir, is the poUlical capital on wLich she has
to irada.
But what has Tennesson to trade upcr.7 I; would
seen), sir, from the view I have p evented of her
internal resources, that ignorence comprises tho
largest «-haie of her stork it: trade, and that the dis-
trict immediately represented by ihe honorable
gent'eman possesses ihe greatest shire, in propor-
tion to its p< pulation, ef that commodity.
But the gentleman professed to give an account
of the natural, moral, and scciai stale of New
Hampshire. Now, sir, I do not coabt that he
truly represents his district. And can it be won-
dered at that be shcukl fall into such gross and
abntr.l errors in lejard to a Slate so far distant,
and of which probably cr.e fourth of his constitu-
eñ's have never nail And, sir, to show that these
errors tre not pecaliar to ihe gentleman alone, but
are common to Tennessee orators of a certain
s'amp, I cust tea leave of the Chair to permit the
Cleiktoread the anecdote which I setd 10 ihe
tab'e.
Mr. Eur.KE sent up an anecdote to be read by
the Clerk.
Th  Clerk read as follows:
