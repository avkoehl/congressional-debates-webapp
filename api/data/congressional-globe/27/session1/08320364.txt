Veto Message—Mr. 'Clay,
Senate.
tthieh, from the exhibition they have heretofore made of finan-
cial skill, t would gladly be spared the labor of learnu g
Although I do not hold myself responsible (or the opinions
of those who3 admitting the competency of Congrt&a to char
tera National Bank, do nevertheless, rest the c institution
altty oí the act upon the happening of such necessity as I
hive before described, yet! think I may safely imdei take ihe
gra(ui'ous labor of defending those opmi ns against the lal
lery of the Senator from Virginia That ¡earned ¡senator
scoutaa theoiy which, deriving a power of Congress from a
ne^sity that may exist today and cease to moirow, herds
the Constitution to every fluctuating \-,arpone, the occasion
for which may expire befoie that purpose is execu ed iJe
objects to stietchyig the Constitution like India rubber, to
njeet each variable ephemeral exigency but contends that
we mu^t look for every powet la the petmanentand duiabie
Ítrovisiorts of-^ur fundamental law, and as flowing plainly
rom the tern oí th*  Const tu ion use If If is enough foi

recognise j by the seno il to svhi^h he belongs Cernidme i of
that school are opposed to a pmtective tautfas a \ jiation of

it raises one cent of rtvenui "beyond what ia needed for the
servioeof the Government The power 10 levy taxes an 1 to

the 1 tw(5 of todiy mav raise an unconstitutional amount of íe
Venue to morrow If then the question of the meie quantum
ot revenue may determine the legility of the acts of Congress
how much greatei show of reason have they who allow in ip
parent exigency and necessity to control them in the a lop ion of
a specific measure for the administration ot the public finance ?
In every depaitment of lift, and n>t It s m ffovt¡ nmental U
