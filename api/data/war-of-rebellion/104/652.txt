Major-General WILSON:

A boat leaves for Savannah at noon to-day. Have you any communication to send by her? The rebel troops now at Washington claim all their horses as private property; say they have never belonged to Confederate States. Shall they be turned over to war officers at Washington? There are 300 pairs of pants here under charge of C. S. quartermaster. The troops at Washington are reported as greatly in need of them. Shall they have them or not? Have received no answer in regard to forwarding stores. To whom are the commissary supplies to be invoiced?

E. UPTON,

Brevet Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

AUGUSTA, GA., May 7, 1865.

Major-General WILSON:

Have you any telegraphic dispatches for Savannah? The boat leaves at 12. Will detain it till this dispatch is answered.

E. UPTON,

Brevet Major-General.

MACON, May 7, 1865.

Major General E. UPTON,

Augusta, Ga.:

Under the terms the troops at Washington have no right to retain their horses. Only officers' horses and side-arms are exempted. You may issue the clothing to them, but compel them to be in the houses. Invoice the stores to Lieutenant Brown, acting chief commissary, but retain them at Augusta till further orders, except such as your division requires at Atlanta. Lieutenant Brown will send an officer with instructions.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
