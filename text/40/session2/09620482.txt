Funding the National Debt—Mr. Marshall.
40th Cong....2d Sess.
Treasury Department on the 1st of July it
would have shown a still more fearful increase
in our public liabilities. I cannot see how our
financial affairs could wellbe worse managed
than they are under Radical policy; and it
seems that when you have so utterly and so
completely failed, you might listen with some
respect and some diffidence in your own infal-
libility to those who propose to show that all
those evils can be easily and speedily remedied
by the introduction of reforms plain, simple,
and easily understood.
The five-twenty bonds outstanding on the 1st
day of June amounted to $1,494,756,000, the
armual interest on which amounts, in gold, to
$89,(145,386. The principal of this debt is
clearly payable in legal-tender Treasury notes,
as, I have heretofore demonstrated. If we can
pay this debt and get rid of this heavy burden
of annual interest the residue of the debt will
scarcely be felt, and can easily be disposed
of. That this can be done I propose now to
show.
As I have already stated, no one expects to'
pay this debt at one time or in one year. In
fact there is scarcely sufficient gold coin in the
whole world to pay our public debt in one pay-
ment. And we do not expect, whatever we
may use asmoney or for a circulating medium,
to have in circulation or to put in circulation
at any time an amount of it equal to our pres-
ent public indebtedness. We do not think this
desirable. But every one knows that when
business is active and the country prosperous
one dollar kept actively employed, and pass-
ing from hand to hand, may in one year supply
the medium of exchange for hundreda of trans-
actions of one dollar each, or liquidate debts
amounting to hundreds of dollars. It is not
absolutely necessary that there should be any
increase in our currency to enable us by proper
reform in the administration to pay off this
debt in a very short time, although I believe a
considerable increase is at this time necessary
for the purpose of giving activity to business
and restoring prosperity to the country.
WIND CP NATIONAL BANKS AND SUBSTITUTE GREEN-
BACKS FOR THEIR CURRENCY.
As we have for the present abandoned coin
as a medium of exchange, and cannot speed-
ily return to it without reducing the whole
country to bankruptcy, it is certain that no
substitute has been so popular with the people,
or has answered its purpose so well, as the
greenback currency. I will not now discuss
the wisdom or policy of introducing this cur-
rency. We must now deal with facts as they
are. The establishment of the national banks
was a great blunder, if not a crime. If we
are to have a paper currency the Treasury
notas are the most popular, the safest, and the
best secured. And if there is any profit to be
derived from the issuance of a paper currency
the Government, representing the entire peo-
ple, and not private corporations or individ-
uals, should be the beneficiaries thereof. Why
these national banks were established I never
could understand. Enormous profits have been
made thereby, but the Government has lost
and the public have not been benefited. To
show the iniquitous and ruinous working of
this banking system I will repeat what a gen-
tleman on'this floor states as having occurred
in an eastern State within his own observa-
tion
An association of gentlemen raised $300,000
in currency. They went to the office of the
Register of the Treasury and exchanged their
currency for $300,000 in six per cent, gold-
bearing bonds. They then went into the office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the same
building, organized a national bank, deposited
their $300,000 in bonds and received for their
bank $270,000 in the national currency. They
had let the Government have §30,000 in cur-
rency moue than they received for banking pur-
poses, and had on deposit $800,000 in bonds,
on which they received as interest from the
Government §18,000 a year in gold. This was
pretty good financiering for these bankers to
receive $18,000 per annum in gold on the
$30,000 in currency which they had thus loaned
to the Government. But this is not the whole
story. They had their bank made a public
depository. They soon discovered that there
was scarcely ever less than $1,000,000 of Gov-
ernment money deposited within their vaults.
They did not like to see this vast sum lie idle.
They therefore took $1,000,000 of this Gov-
ernment money and bought $1,000,000 of five-
twenty bonds with it. In other words, they
loaned $1,000,000 of the Government's own
money to the Government, and deposited the
bonds received i* the vaults of,their bank, on
which they received from that same Government
$60,000 in gold per annum as interest. Thus
for the $30,000 in currency which they origin-
ally loaned the Government they were receiv-
ing in interest annually in all $78,000 in gold.
And all this was under the regular operations
of your banking law. This was certainly good
financiering for these cute Yankees, but what
kind of financiering is it for the Government,
and when do you suppose we can get out of
debt under such a system ? All this must be
changed. The Government has issued in this
way to the various banks $300,000,000 in bank
currency, and has received $330,000,000 in
bonds on deposit as security. We propose to
compel the withdrawal of this bank currency
from circulation, and to substitute therefor
$300,000,000 in legal-tender greenbacks, with
which we will payoff that amount in five-twenty
bonds. We thus get rid of the payment of
$18,000,000 per annum of interest we are pay-
ing thereon, do not increase "the volume of cur-
rency one cent, and have a better and more
popular circulating medium. If we should set
apart each year this $18,000,000, which we
would otherwise be payingas interest, we would,
with accumulations thereon, in a few years have
a sufficient sum to liquidate the residue of the
five-twenty bonds.
EXTRAVAGANCE AND CORRUPTION OF THE RADICAL
PARTY.
But we demand other reforms even more im-
portant than this. Your administration of the
Government has been reckless and extravagant
beyond all precedent. The peculations and
robberies perpetrated since your party has been
in power are without a parallel in the history
of the world. I appeal to facts for an affirma-
tion of these charges. You have taxed the
people as no people have ever been taxed be-
fore in any age or in any country. In the three
years of peace since the close of the war you
have raised from their hard earnings by the
drag-nets you have spread out all over tlieland
$1,500,000,000, a sum so enormous that the
mind can scarcely grasp or comprehend it. If
it were possible to raise this sum in silver dol-
lars they would load forty-six thousand eight
hundred and seventy-five wagons with two thou-
sand pounds to each wagon; and if they were
to be moved, allowing twenty rods for each
wagon and team, it would form a train stretch-
ing out two thousand nine hundred and twenty-
nine miles. You have raised from the people
in one single year over five hundred and sixty
million dollars. And yet with all this enor-
mous taxation the public debt is at this moment
rapidly increasing, as I have already shown.
It has not required exceeding $140,000,000 at
any time to pay the interest on the public debt.
I arraign you before the world as guilty of high
crimes against the people. I demand of you
to plead and tell as what you have done with
this money. You are now upon trial at the
bar of an indignant and greatly wronged peo-
ple. It is impossible that this enormous sum
could have been expended in a legitimate and
honest administration of the Government. I
will contrast this iniquity with the expenditures
of Administrations before your party came into
power; and that the House and the country
may fully comprehend the facts I will here
produce some tables, one of which I have
heretofore brought to the attention of the
House:
Table giving the entire expenditures of the Federal
Government, exclusive of the public debt, from the
foundation of the Government to the dose of the lust
British war.

Thus it is seen that the entire expenditures
of the Government from the adoption of the
Constitution to the close of the last war with
Great Britain did not amount to one third of
what was raised from the people by taxation
for the single year of 18G6.
The average annual expenditures of the
Government at different specified periods for
the forty years immediately preceding the ad-
vent of the Republican party to power in 1861
were as follows, according to a table furnished
by Hon. David A. Wells, Special Commissioner
of Revenue, in his last annual report. Mr.
Wells is a member of the Republican party,
and of course does not misrepresent facts to the
damage of his own party:
Average annual expenditures of the Government for
periods often years each.
1821-31 (ten years) $16,170,000
1831-41 (ten years)  25,030,000
1841-51 (ten years)  35,740,000
1851-61 (ten years)  60,680,000
The third of these periods (from 1841 to
1851) embraces the time of the Mexican war,
and yet the average annual expenditures of
this decade, including civil list, pensions, In-
dians, Navy and War Departments, do not
reach $36,000,000. In view of these facts will
some gentleman on the Radical side of the
House tell the country whyit isthatitis neces-
sary to raise from the people $500,000,000 a
year, and that even with this enormous taxa-
tion the public debt is now rapidly increasing?
These are questions answers to which an indig-
nant people will demand of you when you ap-
pear before them mill asking their suffrages.
But these expenditfSes are not and cannot be
necessary. Abolish your military governments
in the South, by which you are supporting the
negro governments established there. Reduce
your large standing Army to what it ought to
be in time of peace, a mere police force.
Abolish your Freedmen's Bureau, by which
you are teaching politics and laziness and vaga-
bondism to your negro proUgts. Reduce your
expensive Navy, go back to the principles of
economy and honesty, and introduce the
necessary reforms in every branch of the ser-
vice, and you can in this way save one hundred
or one hundred and fifty millions more to be
applied annually to the payment of the prin-
cipal of these five-twenty bonds. The interest
will in this way year by year be rapidly dimin-
ishing, and the amount saved thereby each
year can also be applied to the payment of
the principal of those bonds, and it requires
no mathematician to see that in this way tho
entire five-twenty bond indebtedness may be
