Maj. General JOSEPH J. REYNOLDS,Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: The firing heard when I left headquarters was only a few shots on Baird's front. Baird informed me that before receiving the order to close to the left on Sheridan, he was in that position. After leaving him I rode around the line of pickets on my front. The officer in command of the advance post immediately to right of Rossville road reports the movement of wagons on his front, but could give no information as to the direction they were moving. He said, "They are massing troops on our front; I heard distinctly the order, 'close in mass.'" The officer in command of a detachment of the Sixteenth and Nineteenth Regulars reports the felling of trees by the enemy near the base of Lookout Mountain. From the direction he pointed in giving the information, they may be blocking the road around the point of the mountain.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.
