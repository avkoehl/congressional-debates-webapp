THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

The re^oluti^n bavin# been read—
The SPEAKER said: In the opinion of (he
Chair, no resolution, no business is in order until
a Cleric shall have been elected, and the House
can take action upon no subject whatever until
the election of a Clerk—that being necessary to
the organization of the House.
Mr. BROWN. I suppose some motion is ne-
cessarily in order?
The SPEAKER. No motion is in order, ex-
cept the motion made by the gentleman from Iili- !
nois, [Mr. Harris,] that the House proceed to j
the election of a Clerk. J
Mr. KAUFMAN rose to inquire whether the j
motion of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. har- '
ris] was debatable; because, if it was so, he had
risen for the purpose of moving the previous ques- ;
tion ?
The SPEAKER. The Chair does not think ]
that the motion to go into the election of Clerk is :
debatable. If it is so, the debate must be confined |
within very narrow limits. But the Chair thinks :
that the question is not debatable at all. ■
Mr. KAUFMAN. Then it is unnecessary for
me to move the previous question. i
Mr. BROWN, That i may have the sense of i
the House upon that question, I appeal from the ,
decision of the Chair. And I should like to sub- ;
mit a remark. . |
The SPEAKER. The Chair has ruled that ;
the resolution of the gentleman from Mississippi j
[Mr. Brown] is out of order, upon the ground 1
that the House is not organized until a Clerk shall !
have been elected,and that no business is in order '
until the House shall have been organized by the j
election of Clerk. From this decision the gentle- j
man from Mississippi appeals. And the question ,
is, " Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the i
judgment of the House?" 1
And thequestion thereon was taken and decided '
in the affirmative without a division. j
So the judgment of the Chair was affirmed. |
The question then recurred and was taken on the i
motion of the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Har- i
m^,] that the House do now proceed to the elec-
tion of a Clerk; and it was decided in the affimative |
without a division.
So ihe motion was agreed to.
And thereupon the House proceeded to the
election, viva voce, of a Clerk.
