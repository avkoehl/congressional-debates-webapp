will require traverses for every two guns. I also propose to place two sections of light 12s on the line next the redan, one to flank each face. The engineers have this in charge. At least two good magazines will be wanted.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,July 15, 1864. (Received 2 p.m.)

Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

It is reported that the enemy was moving forces to his right, or our left, last night, and cavalry was moving in that direction this morning about 10 o'clock. The enemy is building an interior line of rifle-pits, plainly visible from the top of our breast-works. If I may be allowed to make a suggestion, I would respectfully state that our works are unnecessarily strong for artillery. The works are being constructed as if we expected to occupy them and not make others to their front.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, FOURTH DIV., FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 15, 1864.

Lieutenant RANSOM,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourth Division:

LIEUTENANT:The explosion this p.m. on my front was the firing of a small magazine of the enemy near his mortar battery in front of my right, and near the group of buildings on the hill. The explosion was the effect of a shell from the mortar battery in rear of my line.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDW. S. BRAGG,

Lieutenant Hough, engineer officer, is here with 5,000 shovels and 2,000 picks. I thought it possible that they might be intended for General Hancock instead of me. If there are any instructions in reference to them please send to me. The tools were sent by General Benham from City Point. Please answer immediately.

Major-General.
