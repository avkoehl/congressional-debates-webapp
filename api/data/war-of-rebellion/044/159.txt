"Major-General SCHENCK,

"Baltimore:

" If you want more troops in the west, and at Harper's Ferry, why do you leave so large a force at Winchester? As I have often repeated to you verbally an in writing, that is no place to fight a battle . It is merely an outpost, which should not be exposed to an attack in force .

"H. W. HALLECK,

"General-in-Chief. .

" "Washington, May 8, 1863.

"Major-General SCHENCK,

"Baltimore:

"You will maintain only a small force at Winchester, as an outpost, and employ the re-mainder of Milroy's troops for the protection of the railroad and operations against the enemy in Western Virginia .

"Washington, D. C., June 8, 1863.

"Major-General SCHENCK,

"Baltimore:

" The indications are that the enemy is massing about 12, 000 cavalry and artillery in Culpeper County for a raid . Deserters say the men have been given to understand that it is to be a long and desperate one . "I can only repeat the recommendation, so often made to you, to mass your troops more in convenient places for rapid and concerted operations, holding railroad bridges only with small detachments, in block-houses, and exposing no large force in advanced positions, where they are liable to be cut off . "We probably shall not know the direction or intention of this rail till it is actually in motion . Hence the necessity of keeping your forces well in hand for a sudden movement .

"Baltimore, June 9, 1863 .

"Major-General SCHENCK,

" Dover, Del.:

"Halleck telegraphs:`Expose no large force in advanced positions, where it is liable to be cut off. ' " I understand this refers to Winchester, and we have other telegrams to the same effect. What points for concentration does Halleck suggest as the proper ones? As Stuart's force is mounted, and ours infantry, the query is important . Does he mean that we should occupy Martinsburg, Harper's Ferry, and Point of Rocks? "

DONN PIATT,

"Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief of Staff . "

"DOVER, DEL., June 9, 1863.

"Lieutenant Colonel DONN PIATT,

"Chief of Staff:"Halleck has never indicated points of concentration . Maryland Heights, of course, is one ; any other must be somewhat determined by circumstances. Confer with Kelley and Milroy. Be slow about leaving Winchester, but not too slow. Frederick City may became very important if any crossing be attempted east of Harper's ferry. I will be home by 4 to-morrow morning . Ask Halleck if he has any points to suggest .

"Baltimore, Md., June 9, 1863 .

"Major-General HALLECK,

" General-in-Chief.:

" Does your knowledge of rebel movements enable to you suggest the better points on the railroad to concentrate?
