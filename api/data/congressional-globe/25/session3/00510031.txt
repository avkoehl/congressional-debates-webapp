from the magnificence and profusion of Ins gtn

who had been the greatest oiTendeis themselves,
weie now not very candidly endeavoring to im
pute the offense to others He could not, so far
as these repeated imputations of extravagance
tended to identify him with them, hear them with
patience orcomposme He had, for the last nine
yeais, steadily voted against appropuations for
objects of internal improvements He had almost
mev ery instance, if not in every one, voted against
harbor bills, which have been one of the largest
items of expense, because they had almost inva-
riably contained some appropuations that he be
lieved unconstitutional He had voted against the
act m 1832, by which the militia of the Re\olu
tion vv"ie pensioned, which had lun the item of
pensions up to a sum of moie than four millions
annually, and which was at that time vitvve I by

for that most extiavagautmeasuie now talk about
an inertise of tut public cxpenditmes as if taey

ernment unless indispensable 1i the e\ei tition of
some new law lequ led, as he thoug it, by the

The Senator from Kentucky, m hisrcmatksof
to-day, repudiates the doctrine attributed to him
by gentlemenir debate, of -wishing to raise money
for puiposts other than the wants ofthe Govein
ment, but, at the same time, again enforces upon
our attention the merits of his bill for the distn
bution of the piocetds ansing ñora the sales of
