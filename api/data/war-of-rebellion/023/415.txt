Gov. RICHARD YATES:

SIR: Recent information indicates a strong demonstration by the enemy upon Kentucky, and it is important that troops should be brought here with all possible dispatch. Please hasten the movements of your regiments as much as possible and notify me how fast I may expect them. Let the first regiments come here instead of to Henderson if this will expedite the arrival of troops at this point. Perhaps you can send to both points at the same time without any interference in transportation.
