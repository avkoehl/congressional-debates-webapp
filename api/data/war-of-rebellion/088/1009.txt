CITY POINT, VA., September 25, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

Thursday will be the day upon which efforts will be made in the direction indicated in our conversation yesterday. I want a brigade of cavalry, well commanded, to report to General Butler. I think it will be well to start the brigade you select on a scout to-morrow morning to push out east, keeping about the route followed by hampton when on his cattle raid; farther out if they can, and come into the James River, and up to City Point, crossing over to Bermuda Hundred after night. They should ride slowly and preserve their horses, except where they may come upon the enemy. It is not necessary that the cavalry commander should know the object of his reporting to General Butler, or even that he is to report to him until his arrival at City Point.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
