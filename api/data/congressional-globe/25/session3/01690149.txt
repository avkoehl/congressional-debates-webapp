former gentleman, they weie taken up in the fol-
lowing order:
The bill making appropriations for the payment
ofrevolutionaiyand other pensionéis foi the year
1839, was considered and oideied to be leported
Without amendment
The bill making appropriations foi the protec
tion of the northern hontier of the United States
was amended, and, aftei a bnef discussion be-
tween Messis CAMBRELENG, BELL,GAR-
LAND of Louisiana, and BRONSON, was oi-
deied to be lepoited to the House                            |
The bill making appropriations for the current |

The bill making appropriations foi the sup

amended, and laid aside
The bill making appiopuations for the support
of the Aimy toi the year 1839, was taken up,
and aftei some amendments, moved by Mr
CAMBRELENG, had been agreed to,
Mi ORARY moved to strike out the follow-
ing clause:
' Tor Uves on the Passjaink arsenal, near Philadelphia,
for the yt ir 1S39, $"bo 50 "                                               I
Mr CAMBRELENG explained that the Uni-
ted States had never yet acquired jurisdiction over
this propei ty fiom the State                                       I
Mr CRARY Then that offers an additional
reason for the motion, and an mesistible one
why an arsenal should be removed altogethei,
over which they could not claim jurisdiction
Mr MALLORY hoped the motion would pre-
vail, foi this charge was the only instance of the
kind in the whole country
The motion pievailed
Mr CALHOUN,of Massachusetts, complained
of the íeduction made m this bill of the item of
|300,000 foi the national armories, from ^360,000,
which had been appropriated in foimer years
Mi MASON, of Virginia, moved to add the
sum of §60,000 to the item, and advocated his
amendment
The amendment was buefly opposed by Messrs
CAMBRELENG and PETRIKIN
Mr. PRATT was understood to be in favor of
the amendment, and in the course of his íemaiks
deprecated the punciples urged by some, that the
Govei nment should manufacture for itself, instead
of having her armspiocured by means of pnvate
contraets He contended that the Government
hadcaies enough to occupy its various depart-
ments, without increasing them by becoming a
great manufacturer, and showed that, so far as
the economy of the matter was concerned, it re-
sults greatly to its advantage to have all its arms
made by contract Theie would not be that strict
Rgard to economy in labor, m establishments
owned by the Government, as all experience con-
clusively showed, as is used by private mdivid- i
uals, hence their ability to manufactuie for the '
Government at a less rate than it could possibly
be done by any other system it might invent or
put in operation
He was in favor of exciting a just competition ¡
among the mechanics     Let competition come in |
for its share     By creating this competition we j
excite among the mechanics a kind of emulation,
which bungs into requisition all their ingenuity, ¡
and causes developments and impiovements in
mechanism, which otherwise might be dormant
and be lost to the world     He was opposed to this
principle of Government manufactures for othei,
and, he conceived, as weighty reasons   Hesaid, i
in warm party excitement the conflict would be
even carried into the Government work-shops
The party which might succeed would, in all
•probability, be induced to make political piefei-
ences, and would employ only those who might
suit its political views, and thus, in the rise and
fall of eveiy Administration, we would witnessa
discharge and a new selection He always
wished to see the mechanics of our countiy oc-
cupy the high and independent giound they now
stand upon, uninfluenced by the contaminating
rule of party He nevei wished to see man's
labor so connected with the Government as to
bias or control, in the íemotest degree, his po'it-
lcal principles or paity pieferences The offices
undei the Constitution belong to the public, and
are not cieated or confened upon individuals for
their peculiar benefit, but HSr the good and wel-
faie of the community But as a man's laboi is
his own pnvate pioperty, and belongs exclu-
sively to himself, and which he alone has the
light to guaid and protect, therefoie would he
depiecate any state of things which would tend
to violate this sacred light It was foi these rea-
sons that he was oppos d to what are called Gov
ornment mechanics Mr P said he was pioud
to be a mechanic himself, and wished to piotect
the lntmests of that woithy class of men, so far
as his ability could have any influence Believ-
ing, as he did, that it was a saving to the Gov-
ernment to continue to purchase oi contract for
such arms as were necessaiy, he would vote for
the amendment, to continue the usual appropri-
ation
Mi  WILLIAMS,of Noith Carolina, obtained
the floor, and opposed the  amendment, it was
fuithoi suppoited by Messis LINCOLN, MER
CER, and C4LHOUN of Massichusetu, when, I
on dividing the enmm ttce, theie were—ayes 5rj, '
