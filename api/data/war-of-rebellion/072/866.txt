position which he could hold until he can be re-enforced, and if necessary to do this our left must be refused; that he must not place his troops in such a position as to risk being turned, and to say to General Johnson that he must place his troops so as to secure our left flank. General Thomas hopes to have Davis' division in the a. m., and then Palmer will re-enforce our left. General Wood endeavored to carry the enemy's works in his front, but could not do so as the enemy not only opened a murderous fire from their front line of works but also terrible cross-fires from both flanks. He planted his colors, though, within twelve feet of the breast-works. The enemy's artillery firing was very accurate and effective. 6.30 p. m., General Wood (in accordance with General Thomas' instructions) commenced to withdraw from the front, General Johnson's troops relieving him, and to move over to our right and little in the rear, taking the position held by McLean's brigade, of Schofield's corps, and pushing McLean over to the right, thus endeavoring to close the gap between McL[ean] and the rest of troops of the Twenty-third Corps, and make our connection with the same. A request was also sent to General Schofield to connect with McLean. General Wood was instructed to strengthen his position during the night. The loss in killed and wounded in the corps to-day was about 1,500, mostly in the Third Division. Day very hot. The enemy made an attack on Stanley's and Newton's divisions at 4 p. m.; he was quickly driven back. Hazen reported this evening that he would have taken the works in his front but Johnson did not properly support him, not coming within half a mile of his line; that there were no works in front of Johnson, even two regiments of Hazen's brigade extended beyond them on the left.
