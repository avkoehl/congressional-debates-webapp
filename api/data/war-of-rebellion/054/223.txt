was merely to seize a hill which commanded the enemy's road, and hold the hill against any force that might come up from his main body, send back on his track three brigades to pick up everything that was behind, and, if time and circumstances favored, make an attack with the entire division upon the main camp, and endeavor to crowd the enemy into the river.

The movement of even Jenkins' division was so much delayed that I fear that nothing was accomplished. I left him about 1 o'clock, and we just got to the road. As there was nothing there, and it was too late to make any move against the main camp, I directed him to see if he could find any wagons behind, and stragglers, and return to his camp. As we had no artillery, nor any means of getting any over, I did not think it proper to put a force out where it could be exposed to that of the enemy during daylight, and to have moved on at that late hour to attack the enemy's main camp would have kept us till after daylight.

When I left the railroad, there seemed to be no prospect of doing anything.

About an hour and a half after I left, I got a message from General Jenkins, stating that a brigade was heavily engaging the Twelfth Army Corps.

I will send the report of General Jenkins as soon as it is made. I presume that little or nothing was accomplished.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES LONGSTREET,
