As the cost of material, labor, subsistence, &amp;c., has rapidly advanced, the amount of money which will be required for the operation and construction of U. S. military telegraph for the present year, if the war continues to its fiscal end, will be proportionately increased. Probably $90,000 to $100,000 per month will be required to meet the indispensable expenditures of the corps.

A monthly average of 1,000 persons have been engaged in the military telegraph service within the several departments during the fiscal year of 1864. The number at present in the service is considerably greater, and increases as the Federal forces advance or the military operations become more active and extended.

Herewith is statement A* of quartermaster's property received from all sources, transferred, expended, and on hand June 30, 1864, condensed from the property statements accompanying the reports of the different quartermasters.

I take pleasure in stating that the several assistant quartermasters and assistant superintendents engaged in the military telegraph service have invariably responded with willing alacrity to all orders issued from these headquarters, having in view the execution of such demands as have been made upon me from time to time for increased or extraordinary telegraphic facilities.

Your perusal of their respective reports is very respectfully solicited.

I heartly indorse the compliments tendered by the different assistant superintendents to the employes under charge. These men generally have faithfully pursued their various duties with commendable reliability and often under circumstances requiring force of character sufficient to undergo many privations, resist, stampedes, and risk cap-
