committee does the Senator move to
bill?
Mr. MORTON. To the Committee on the
Judiciary; and on that motion I desire to be

remarks that I intend to submit this morning.

A hill to punish the collection of illegal taxes on
passengers.

Mr. MORTON addressed the Senate. [See
Appendix.]
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. The ques-
tion is on referring the bill to the Committee
on the Judiciary.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Presi-
dent 
Mr. SHERMAN. The morning hour has
expired.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The morn-
ing hour has expired. The bill will be referred,
however, if there is to be no debate upon it.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. There is to be
further debate if I can get the floor.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unfin-
ished business of yesterday is before the
Senate.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I desire to have
an _ opportunity of answering the argument
which has been made by the Senator from
Indiana before this bill is referred. The ar-
gument, as well as the bill introduced, is in
aid of the railroad interests of New Jersey
and antagonistic to the State of New Jersey.
The railroads will be very much obliged to
Congress for passing a law that their taxes
shall not be collected, while they possess the
franchises with which they are now invested.
As this bill directly affects the treasury of the
State that I in part represent, I desire the
opportunity of being heard either now or on
some other occasion. I am ready to proceed
now to discuss the question.
Several Senators. Go on.
Mr. CATTELL. I hope permission will be
given to my colleague to proceed with his re-
marks at this time, and I therefore make that
motion.
Mr. SHERMAN. I trust that we shall go
on with the regular order of business. I have
no objection to the Senator making his speech
at any time ; but the railroad bill is now the
regular order, and I hope we shall go on
with it-
Mr. SUMNER. I will ask the Senator from
Ohio/whether the railroad bill cannot be put
asi^ informally without losing its place, so
tMt the Senator from New Jersey can make
'his reply ?
/ Mr. SHERMAN. It is not at all necessary
to do that. The Senator from New Jersey
can submit his remarks on the railroad bill.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. No; I will make
them on this bill.
_ Mr. CATTELL. I hope permission will be
given to my colleague to proceed. The some-
what unusual course of making an argument
upon the reference of a bill has been taken to-
day, and as the State which I in part represent
is directly interested, I trust that my colleague
will have an opportunity to reply now.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 certainly have no dis-
position to prevent his replying now, if it can
be done by unanimous consent informally
without displacing the unfinished business.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unfin-
ished business can be passed over informally
by^ unanimous consent. Does any Senator
object?
Mr. GRIMES. I object, because I think the
bill now under consideration is of a gteat deal
more public importance than the one which
comes up as the unfinished business. There-
fore I am ready to vote to continue the consid-
eration of the bill now before us.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have no objection to the
unfinished business being laid aside informally.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is
objected to, and it can only be done by a mo-
tion.
Mr. GRIMES. I move to lay aside the
pending order and all prior orders with a view
to continue the consideration of the bill intro-
duced by the Senator from Indiana.
Mr. SHERMAN, Let us understand each
other. The Senator from Iowa now states dis-
tinctly that he makes this motion in hostility
to the pending bill for the charter of railroad
companies, i have no objection to its being
laid aside informally so as to enable the Sen-
ator from New Jersey to reply to the Senator
from Indiana ; but, as a matter of course, the
postponement of the bill at this time for any
purpose of that kind is its defeat. I trust,,
therefore, that it will not be postponed for any
suÂ«h purpose. If it is done it is a substantial
defeat of the bill for this session. I ask for the
yeas and nays on the motion.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
^Mr. SUMNER. _ Before the vote is taken, I
wish to appeal again to the Senator from Ohio
to^ allow the unfinished business to be laid
aside informally.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have not the slightest
objection in the world to that. I have indicated
my willingness to lay it aside informally, but
the Senator from Iowa is not willing that it
should be done.
1 he PRESIDENT pro tempore. That ques-
tion has been settled.
_ Mr. GRIMES. I wish to say that the objec-
tion I have to allowing it to be laid aside in-
formally is simply because it gives the Senator
irom Ohio entire control of the legislation and
action of this body during the day. If we lay
it aside informally to allow one Senator to
speak, then it is at his option whether it shall
be laid aside for another Senator. I object to
that kind of proceeding. I want the Senator
from New Jersey to have an opportunity to be
heard, and then lot everybody have a chance
to bring up his business as well as the Senator
