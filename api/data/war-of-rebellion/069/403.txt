HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864-2.15 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

General Neill's dispatch received. Has no communication been had with you by the commander of the cavalry covering the right of the army? Do your pickets and the cavalry pickets connect?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864. (Received 2.55 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Wright is now at the front. An officer from General Wilson was here this morning to ascertain the right of our line, and to connect with it. I suppose he made the connection. I will send to Colonel Edwards to learn if he does not connect with General Wilson, and will notify you.

M. T. McMAHON.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-4.30 p. m. (Received 4.35 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Staff officers have returned and report the only roads to Warren's rear or left to be by Haw's Shop; thence either by passing Via's, where his headquarters are, or by the Old Church road. The latter, which leads to Warren's left, is represented as the better of the two.

H. G. WRIGHT.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864-5.15 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

The commanding general directs me to say that there is a very good route for your troops to Warren's, passing by Burnside's headquarters, much shorter than routes you mention, made by Butnside's troops yesterday.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

SIXTH CORPS,

May 31, 1864. (Received 6.50 p. m.)

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
