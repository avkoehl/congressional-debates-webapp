The following is a list of the prisoners taken from Company D, First North Carolina Union Volunteers, on the 12th of March, 1863: H. C. Palmer; A. W. Keaton, died March 31, 1863; Frank M. Town, died April 6, 1863.

The following is a list of the men taken on the 6th of April, 1863:

Lieutenant L. A. Bigger, Corpl. Benjamin Pendelton, Privates Henry Luters, James Luton, John A. Mead, Henry Boyd and Lemuel James.

I have been informed that there were two men from a company at Washington, N. C., during the battle at that place last summer and that they were confined in same way as those of my company and one of them had died since being confined in prison, and that there had never been any demand made for their release.

Praying that there may be something done by the authorities in power to have these men treated as other U. S. Volunteers, prisoners of war, I subscribe myself,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. C. SANDERS,

Captain Company D, First North Carolina Union Volunteers.
