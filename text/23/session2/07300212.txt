212       _______________     THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.________________February 1,
tion of the office of diaftsman It had been sub-
sequently found necessary to reinstate this officer
]f ihegent'eman wbu'd modify his reso'ution so
ns to inquue into all the abuses m the puouc de-
partments, wi li a view to leform, he should have
his hearty assent He would go with him most
heartily in all attempts to coirect abuses tie
had been informed that aftei the office of drafts-
man was abolished, it had cost ten times moie to
procure the necessary work to be done by the
job, than was paid to this officer Why had not
the regular draftsman of the House been called
unon to execute the work which had been done
by anotner' If he had been so called upon, and
refused, then it would be a proper subject of
inquiry In conclusion, he repeated that if the
gentleman would so shape his resolution as to
li quire into any and all abuses which might exist
in the departments, he should have his cordial
cooperation
Mr STEWART said this was rather a small
mattei, aknough it seemed likeiy to lead to a long
debate There was but tin ee weeks remaining of
the present session, and much important business
to be acted upon He would, therefoie, move to
lay the resolution on the table
Mi SCHLEY asked foi the yeas and nays on
the motion, which weie oidered
M LOVE could not vote to lay the resolution
on the table, although he was opposed to the
adoption of the lesomtion in its piesent shape
Mr S1EWART wnhdiew his motion to lay
the resolution on the table
Mr SCHLEY said it was impossible for him
to krow the motives which actuated the course of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr McKen
nan ] lie had thought fit to attribute impioper
motivet to him, (Mi S) It would peil aps be
bettei foi the gentleman to look to his own mo
Uves, without reflecting upon those of others He
was not in the habit of imputingunworthy motives
to others, and he had no evidence that would au
thorize him to impute such to the gentleman fiom
Pennsylvania, [Mr McKennan ] But if the old
maxim be true, " that we judge others by our
selves," then it would follow that the gentleman
made propositiorls fiom unworthy motives He,
(Mi S ,) howevei, did not believe the-gentleman
oupable of such a couiso
In offering the resolution, he had no favorite m
view, noi was his motion the result of any man
ugement or pieconcert He had no acquaintance
with any person qualified to discharge the duties
of draftsman No applications had been made to
h m No peisons solicited him for ft vois he.e
He had not seen any such persons His associa
tions did not lead him to such discovenes He
had offeied the resolution without consulung any
person He had daily seen the diafisman of the
House engaged in reporting speeches here, while
another individual was employed at the public
expense to discharge his dunes He had inquned
why this was the case, and had obtained no satis-
factory reply If Mr. Stansbeiry was incompe
tent 01 unable to perform these duties, another
should be appointed in his place If laige sums
were to be paid to another for these services, it
was proper that this almost useless officer of the
House should be dispensed with He barely
knew the piesent incumbent when he saw him
He had no objections to him peisonally Hewas
actuated in offering the resolution by considerations
of public duty alone It has been said Jiat this
officer, particularly in relauon to the duties requited
by theland committees, performed his duties faith-
fully If, upon inquiry, it should be found that
all the services required of this officer were per-
formed properly and with fidelity, there would be
an end of the matter, and he, forone, would vote
against the abolition of the office If, on the con
trary, this offre, under present circumstances,
should, upon inquiry, be found to be unneces-
sary, he presumed no gentleman would vote for
its continuance He was surprised that gentle
men should be opposed to this inquiry Do they
feai it'
In relation to the suggestion of his friend from
Kentucky, [Mr Lovf,] as to the propriety of
extending the inquiry to other supposed abuses
in the depaitments of the Government, he should
not obiect to such a proceeding, if it was brought
forwaid in a separate proposition     It was best to
I do one thing at a time If he was aware of any
other abuses, he would not hesitate to bring them
I to the consideiation of the House If the gentle-
man from Kentucky would propose a resolution of
the character indicated by him, he would go for
I it He would be perfectly willing that a select
committee should be raised on any such íesolu-
tion, wi h the gentleman from Kentucky at its
head, and he would be willing to stand at the foot
of such committee, for the purpose of feiretmg out
any abuses which might be supposed to exist.
(     Mr   H  EVERETT desired to know if maps
I had been made by orderof the House, whether the
draftsman of the Houi e had been first required
' to do the servic, previous to the employment of
another Mr Burr, he understood, was the pe-
culiar offioei of the Post Office Depaitment He
wished to know, al&o, whether the maps alluded
to had been oideied by the Post Office Committee
! Mi SCHLEY replied that he understood Mr
Burr had been employed under a resolution of the
House, whether at the instance of the Committee
on the Post Office he knew not
Mr BRIGGS said that, during the last session
of Congress, the Committee on the Post Office re-
quned vanous maps connected with their'duties
i he draftsman of the House had been required to
I execute them, which he failed to do, owing as he
I alleged that the pioperfacilities were withheld fiom
him at the department     The draftsman had ap-
' plied at the department for a map necessary to
the performance of the duty required, but lie was
informed that it could not be taken from the de-
partment, and could only be used in the office
' He knew not whether this apology of the drafts-
man was consideied sufficient The maps were
necessary, and the Clerk of the House was re-
quited by resolution to procure their execution
The Clerk did not apply to the draftsman of the
House under the circumstances, as he understood
from the terms of the resolution he was required
to employ another individual to perform the ser-
vice He considered this officer essentially neces-
saiy     The resolution to which  he had refened
• showed the piopnety of continuing this office
The draftsman employed under the lesolution had
been constantly employed in the discharge of the
duty assigned to him, and it would take months
to complete the woik If the gentleman was
anxious to knowwhethei this officer peiformed
hisduties faithfully, he had better direct his inquiry
to that point He was not prepaied to say
whether this officer had or had not dischmged the
dunes assigned  him with fidelity    He had no
I objection to the inquiry   If the office was abolished,
nothing wouid  be gained by it, as the aeivices
would hive to be pel formed by the job 01 othei
wise, at an expense equal, if not greater than that
at present allowed
The resolution was agreed to

Mr EVANS said, the resolution was one of
considerable importance, and as the hour devoted
to reports and resolutions had neaily expired, he
would pre'er that the resolution should be printed
and postponed to Monday, and that the House

, of the day

! pon°ment of his resolution to Monday, provided
it should be made the special order for that day
He did not propose to discuss it at the present
time The period had, however, arrived when,
under a joint rule of the two Houses, it became
necessary to choose a printer If, theiefoie, the
resolution offered by him was acted upon, it
should be speedily done    He would move that
I theiesoluuon be postponed to Monduy,and made
the special order for that day
