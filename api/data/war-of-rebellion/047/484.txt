SIR: The commanding general, having to visit James Island with the President this morning, requested me to inclose for your information Major Naris' telegram,* which is believed to be reliable in Richmond.

He directed me also to say that he hoped, in view of the possible contingency, it would suit your views to place one or two of your iron-clads, at night, in position to fire between Fort Johnson and Comming's Point, and between Fort Johnson and Battery Simkins, in case the latter work should be unfortunately carried.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[THOMAS JORDAN,]

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding First Military District, Mount Pleasant, S. C.:

GENERAL: Inclosed is a telegram received from Major Norris,* chief of signal corps, Richmond.

The commanding general wishes you to make all necessary arrangements for the contingency, and with a view to the rapid re-enforcement of the command on Sullivan's Island from the troops in Christ Church, which portion of your district, however, should not be left uncovered until the decisive moment.

He suggests also that the Twentieth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers (Keitt's), alternating with some other good regiment, should take post for the present on Sullivan's Island at night, returning to their encampments just before daylight, to escape observation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[THOMAS JORDAN,]
