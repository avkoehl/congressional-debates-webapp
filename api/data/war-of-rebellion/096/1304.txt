HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 11, 1865.

Major E. TAYLOR,

Chief Quartermaster:

General Longstreet wishes you to arrange to have all the staff wagons of the commands employed to-morrow in hauling chevaux-de-frise. You will have them in charge of a quartermaster, who will report to Colonel Johnson to-day. Details will accompany each wagon for the purpose of loading it. They will be at Colonel Johnston's quarters, or wherever else he may direct, at daylight. You will please give this matter your especial attention. The chevaux-de-firse is to be hauled to opposite Fort Harrison.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Your authority will extend over the whole line all the way to the river.
