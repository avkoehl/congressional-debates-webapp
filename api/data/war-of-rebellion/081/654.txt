Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: After the withdrawal of our cavalry yesterday evening from in front of the enemy's works at Harrison's Landing his cavalry again advanced on the Salem Church road, and this morning were reported in some force on that road and at Malvern Hill. General William H. F. Lee easily drove back the force at the latter point, which retreated down the river road beyond Carter's Mill. A brigade of infantry was sent to support the cavalry on the road to Smith's Store and drove the enemy to that point without difficulty. Nothing else of importance has occurred to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.
