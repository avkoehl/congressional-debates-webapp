days yet, but if Butler is all safe at Bermuda Hundred and City Point, we shall move more promptly. General Grant does not expect to be able to cross the Chickahominy any higher than Long Bridge, but will try to get over at Bottom's Bridge and secure road connected with that crossing. Bars will not be completely removed from the York River Railroad before Sunday.

COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11, 1864-4 p.m. (Received 11.10 a.m., 12th.)

Rebel cavalry having yesterday made a dash into Wilson's lines near the Linney house, Wilson this morning sent out a part of McIntosh's brigade to see where enemy was. Their pickets were driven back, and their outer line forced, the cavalry passing over the entrenchments. About a mile west of Bethesda Church, McIntosh came upon Field's division of infantry, and having accomplished the purpose of his reconnaissance, retired. He killed and wounded number of rebels in his progress; brought away 4 or 5 prisoners. He had 16 men killed and wounded. The return of General Grant's officers from Fort Monroe is constantly expected. No order for movement of the army will be given until their arrival. It is pretty much decided, however, that Eighteenth Corps shall go first, turning to City Point via the Windsor Shades, thence proceeding down Chickahominy on steamers. Time for arrival of this corps at City Point, and even for its march to Petersburg, will probably be given before other corps here set out. Weather somewhat cloudy. Rain threatened.

Colonels Comstock and Porter arrived here 2 p.m. Army moves to-night after dark. Eighteenth Corps moves to White House without baggage or artillery to embark for City Point. Fifth Corps crosses the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, and takes up position to secure passage of remainder of the army, after which it will cover the rear. Second, Sixth, and Ninth Corps cross in two column at Long Bridge, and Jones' Bridge. Trains keep to east and cross below Jones' if good place can be found. If not opposed by enemy in force, column will strike James River opposite Bermuda Hundred. If resisted, they will move to point opposite Fort Powhatan. General Butler has been ordered to throw a bridge and corduroy the marsh at the latter point. Whole army will leave lines here at once. The movement here will probably be covered by Sixth Corps taking position in the new interior entrenchments, but this order has not yet been given. White House will be held until arrival of
