HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 23, 1864-6.55 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Pickets report the enemy marching parallel to our rear and toward the Jerusalem road. Two more of Russell's brigades will come over. We continue intrenching.

T. LYMAN.

JUNE 23, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

So far it has been as much as I could do to prevent my flank being turned and quite impossible to form a column of attack. The enemy is evidently in large force, but where he may strike is quite uncertain. It seems to me that till everything is quiet our role is the defensive. In this opinion I am fully sustained by two division commanders; the other is not here.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 23, 1864-7.05 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I imagine that all the disposable rebel force is moving round our left for a general flank attack. The sooner you send up strong supports extending beyond the Jerusalem road the better. If not, I think I should withdraw after dark. I have not believed the matter serious till now, but at this moment it looks so, and I look upon an attack by me as extremely dangerous.

H. G. WRIGHT.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 23, 1864-7.15 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

If the enemy is moving toward the plank road, as reported by Lyman it is of greater importance that you should attack him at once and take him in flank. I fear delay in your movements will prove disastrous. You cannot extend your left, and I have no troops to send. If you attack vigorously with all your force you may check the enemy and after dark rectify your position.

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 23, 1864-7.20 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Your line of battle is the formation to attack in. I know there is no time to form columns. I must hold you responsible if the enemy interposes between you and the plank road and compels you to fight your way back while he attacks you in rear.

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General.
