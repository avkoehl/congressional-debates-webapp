that President, not quite so tenacious of the rights of the States
as the present,would have no scruples, and by this time we
might understand something of the powers of this Board of
Exchequer, and familiarity with danger, we are told, recon
cited us to it And to facilitate all this, instead of having
two agencies m each State and Territory, before two
years theie may be four agencies—for, with an
enlargement of capifal for local discounts, two agen
cíes m each would prove inadequate to the duties
required, and the next step to an mciease of capí
tal would be an increase of officers, and necessarily an in-
crease of Government patronage The increase of officers
may be to any extent—the bill does not say how many are ne
ceesary On that, as on many points, it is indefinite Ibe
power proposed of increasing Government patronage was an
alarming one The bill provides also, a Board, to he com
^oaed of the Secretary of the Treasury, among others, who
isauthonzedtoappointd.il inferior officers, to regulate their
salaries, and the number of agents required to carry out the
provisions of the bill, and all on the recommendation of the
Board* of Exchequer There was no limitation, he repeated,
of the number In good times there migh/ be no dangei,bm
we had fallen upon party times, and party discretion was to act
for us, and who would trust any patty with such a disore
tionary power as this"* He was sure heneecfnot s'opat this
time of day to dwell upon the vast power given to the Execu
tive under this hill, nor could Congress be loo cautious id re
gaid to this power Thev could not too carefully guard the
temple of liberty from the money lendeis of the Government
Already they had heard of the Executive abu&e of power, and
seen it and complained of it It was an immense power al
ready Give the Executive now a bank: armed with thirty,
fifty, or a hundred blanches give him a paity—himself at the
head of it, give him agents of his own selection, dependent
upon him, and accoun ab'e to hin, and wnatmay nut be ap
prehenden?
Already the Constitution had given him the sword He has
an "army of offist-ho dcrs," as ha  become a proverb Give
him now the revenues- of the land, and who would answer
that he will not peipetuate his power. W o will say that
some Casuar or some Napoleon will not rise up and grasp the
Treason y of the nation for himself ¡ He (Mr Morehead) had
been rea ling the wartm g voice of our ancestors Hehadiead
from the patriotic Patrick Henry that theie was nosta'e of
things eo bad as a union of the purse with the sword
He had learned from them, too, never to trust power
in any hands where it may be ut>ed against the people,
and, oppees&ed and cmbairassed as the country was, over
whelmed with misfortunes on ail hand=, he disclaimed all con
nectton with it now henceforth, and forevei He regarded the
dangers at. outweighing ail benefi s Whatever its benefits 01

We want (said he) an institution for curiency and exchanges,
I think even moie, bat nothing shoit of this will answer What
has been the obstacle to obtaining this heretofore'* We all
know it has been the constitutional objections of the President
to a National Bank to operate per *e over.the Union. There is
no such obiection to the proposed Exchequer, it is declared not
to be a Bank, ofcouiseno such objection exists to it If it is
not such a bank, with the contiol over it placed m the power of
the Executive, ¡t would not be if that control were placed else
where The mere power to control it does not alter it in othei
respects, and it appears to me all the objections which have been
urged against the whole plan would be removed by altering
that single provision, all the dangers arise from the apprehended
increase ofExecutive power We certainly can alterit in that
particular, and from what has been said duting the debate, it
must be so altered to obtain any support Every one who has
expressed an 01 imon objects to it, and chiefly and justly I think,
on that ground Those expressing the highest confidence and
¡strongest personal respect for the present Chief Magistrate, ex
ptess the strongest objection to (his provision Those by whose
exertions he was elevated to power and those who opposed his
eievatipn agree m opinion, and denounce this leature a& in the
highest, degree dangerous
There 1? now a remarkable coincidence of onmion among Se
nators f both pames concerning the danger of placing the con
tro! of the ie venue, the fiscal concerns, and the rurrencv of the
nation, within the power of the Executive My political asso
ciates and myself have contended against it for the last ten
yeac The other party oppose it with equal zeal, when it
comes to be pioposed bv any others than those of their own
party I have rea 1 somewhere that it i* a great good to be able
* to see ourselves as otheib see us " Our political opponents
have obtained it The piopo-ition not coming horn them, they
look at it as we did attheiri, which had the same e*fact, and as
strongly oppose u The people, therefore, have one consoling
reflection amid their distress—that their libertiesare safe, so far
as dangei has existed from that qua ter, if our opponents act
consistently with their present professions
Another importaitinquiry is, shall wecndatigei the success
ofthe measuie by makmgsuchan alteration'* I trust not In
carefully looking over the me=¡=;a?Pof the President, I find* hat
he enjoins it upon Confiesa to relieve him fiom a controlling
power over the public Ireasury, and if, in this plan which he
proposes, that separation 13 not as complete as wc desne, to
amend it Theie is nothing in the message which shows any
other than 1 desire to be fieed from this contiol, 01 to give lea

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Wednesday, Jmuary 5,1842
Mr ADAMS rose and moved to amend the journal of yester
day as follows
"Strike out the instructions from the journal of yesterday,
on his motion of December 14, a  Mr A says he withdrew the
instructions ard only moved to refer, the Speaker having
stated, on that day, the instiuctions were not in order, except by
general consent, and Mr Cave Johnson having objected there-
Along discussion followed, involving the facts and the per-
sonal recollection of members, in which Messrs Adams, Hop-
kins, Cave Johnson, Saltonstall, Kennedy oí Indiana,
Criggs, and Meriwether participated.
When Mr MERIWLTriER moved to Jay the amendment On
the table                                                                       __
Mr ADAMS called for the yeas and nays, which were order-
ed, and, being taken, were—yeas 99, nays 78
So the amendment was laid on the table.
Mr PR0FFI1 rose ard asked the indulgence of the House-
while he made a few observations, not certainly on a privileged
question, but on a matter personal to himself Duiing the un-
profitable debate which took place yesterday, bespoke for about
three minutes, and in that time had not said one woid to hurt
the feelings of a solitary individual, 01 to apply personally
to him Let the House then judge of his astonishment and sur-
prise, when on taking up the Nationallntelhgencei this morn-
ing he saw that 01 that floor a gentleman had been permitted to-
u^-e langua5e,accnmpampd by gestures toward him, which under
any encumstances, could not but be regarded as grossly
personal and offensive, without being decided by the Speaker
tobe out of order He perceived that in the National Intelli-
gencer it was «Ldted that the gentlemen from Tennessee [Mr,
AknoldJ even pointed at him whilf making his offensive re-
marks He did not, " tr V said, rise to ask an explanation of
the gertleman fiom lenne^see, áiiú he knew that, in making
thisrefeience to the Hou-e, he was gratifying the feelings of
sou e gentlemen in it, m giving them an opportunity to smile
at him Never having said a soatary word offensive to the
gentleman, nor personal to any one, he would respectfully ask
theSpeaker if he heard the language reported in the Intelh
gencer, as u&ed by the gentleman liom Tennessee If so, all
that he could say wa« that if members were permitted to use
such language to each other, he would, from this day forward,
come to the House prepared to defend himself Mr P con
eluded by thanking the House for the indulgence extended to
him
Mr AR'NOLD was sorry to see the gentleman from Indiana
take the matter so seimu 1> He would say tr the gentleman,
1 owever that he ha 1, on s \efa! occasions whenhe(Mr A)
wa  addressing the Hou«p, most ferociously and insolently called
him to 01 del The gentleman said j esterday, privately to him,
that if h' had his win, he (Mr A ) s tou'd never be heard aga.m
in that ha" Though the gentleman was now «n mmcmg and
1 louest, and di claimed any inten ion ol being persuriul, yet he
was yesterday considerably excited
Mi A concluded by saying that be did use the language that
was attributed to him m the National Intelligence!, and did ap-
plvitto the gentleman fromlnciana
Mi PROFFIThadnodojbt that the gentleman did make
the icmaiks attributed to him and he did not, therefore, rise
for the purpose of asking any explanation of him He could
only say now, that he could not condescend to notice any thing
the gentleman from Tennessee had said, or that he might say,
but if any one on that ñooi that professed h m&e'f to be a gen-
t'eman, w>uld use similar hnguage towards him, or language
ap pi earning to it m the si  h est degree, he would promptly
lake such notice of it as l' deserved
'lhe ^PElKER v oo!d <nate to the gentleirun *rom Indiana
ihat he did not observe the gen lenian from Tennessee pointing
at him or he woui' certainly have called him to order He
had no right to consider the remarks that were made as appU
cable to the gentleman from Indiana, or any other gentleman,
aid certainly would have erred in so doing, as he did not ob
«erve the gesture said to have been used The gentleman from
Tenne=«ee was however called to order bv the gentleman from
Sew\ork, fMr JBowne] and he (the Speaker) thereupon
decided that he "was out ol order
Mi ARMXLD amid crie-of ordei, said he merely wished
to re*inn hi« thanks to the nobie genii* man from Indiana for
the absolution he hdd -nvf 1 him, fm all hi¡> b nf, pasi.and pros
