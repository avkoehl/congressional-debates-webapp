or to-morrow. Wright says there is no trouble at Indianapolis, and I shall assume the responsibility of not going there till I have received an answer to this.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, March 24, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

I don't yet credit report of enemy's numbers. It can't be true, though he must be in some strength. Gillmore can hold his own until re-enforced, and you have still more time. Have again urged Governor Yates to send you the Fourteenth Cavalry, and General Carrington any force he can spare. Burnside is here, and will have some 12,000 old troops in a day or two. We need not be scared.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, March 24, 1863.

Brigadier-General GILLMORE, Lexington, Ky.:

I sent you five companies this morning, and have not another man to spare. Burnside's force will arrive to-morrow, and will be pushed directly on to Lexington. Have heard nothing of rebels at Glasgow. Tell commanders at Paris and Cynthiana that they can and must hold their posts against any force that can be brought against them for the present.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

INDIANAPOLIS, March 24, 1863-8.45 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

General Boyle telegraphs that Danville is taken by a large force. I will send him a battery in the morning. I have another disposable. I think a division should be sent from the Potomac at once. I dare not spare a man here, except artillery.

HENRY B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., March 24 [?], 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel JOSEPH HILL:

The brigadier-general commanding directs me to say that you may expect the re-enforcement by 4 o'clock to-morrow morning. The following is the substance of a dispatch sent you at 11 a.m. to-day:

I suppose you are at Clay's Ferry, crossing your command to this side. I wish you to push forward the work at Tate's Creek, Clay, and Boonesborough Ferries. Re-enforce the party at Boonesborough, and sent at least one good company of the Fourteenth
