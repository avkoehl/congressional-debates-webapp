MARTINSBURG, October 13, 1864.

(Received 9 p.m.)

Colonel J. A. HARDIE:

Captain Kusserow is the officer who caused the recruits of the State of Massachusetts to desert, and knowing them to be deserters, re fused to return them to their command, concealed them, and attempted to have them fraudulently mustered into his own battery. Considering the offense of the gravest known to military law, I placed him in the custody of the provost-marshal for safe-keeping.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Martinsburg, Va., October 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,,

Commanding Military District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that this post is entirely without cavalry, and, in my opinion, it is highly important that there should be a force of at least 800 or 1,000 men stationed here. This being the base of General Sheridan's supplies, there is necessarily a large accumulation of subsistence and stores of all kinds here, which should be properly protected. The nature of the surrounding country makes cavalry picket almost indispensable to guard against surprise. There are constantly being forwarded to the army large trains which require more or less cavalry escort. Dispatches of importance must also necessarily be delayed at times for the want of mounted escorts to carry them through in safety. In addition to all this, a good patrol, or several scouting parties, would in a short time put an end to the annoyance of guerrillas between here and Winchester.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Martinsburg, Va., October 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: Four scouts have just arrived, and report that they were attacked, about eight miles this side of Winchester, by a party of about fifty guerrillas this afternoon. They all seem to be positive that they were attacked by Mosby's men, and that Mosby himself, with one foot bound up, was with them. An escort just arrived with dispatches for the telegraph operator here reports that a sergeant and small party of men sent out with the same dispatches were attacked at the same place and driven back to Winchester.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.
