by giving therrr his vote for what he knew would
be inoperative ana delusive.
Here Mr. G entered into a lengthened review of
the grounds taken by the Senator from Virginia
[Mr Rives] relative to the national right of prop-
erty in the public lands.
He next reverted to the subjects of revenue aDd
national credit, asd decried the idea that a great
country like this, abounding in so many sources of
wealth, and with «such a population ot enierprising
and industrious citizen*;, could be dependent for its
credit on the possession of a source of income
yielding nota million and a half of dollars, while
xt bad a hundrrd millions, of dollars worth of im-
ports to rely upon for any conceivable amount of ne-
cessary revenue to meet ¡he want* of its Government
If it should ever come te that, that direct taxes
should be reported to, he wo ad tell the Senator
frankly, he would be as ready as he was to take
back the land fund; for heculd then see no differ.
ence between giving so much to the people with
one hand, and taking it back with the other, under
disadvantageous circumstances. There was noth-
ing in the Senator's arguments about the hateful-
ness of tax-gatherers entering every collage, that
was not equally applicable to ihe tax-gatherers of
the States, as well as the tax gatherers of the Gen-
eral Government, and if the distribution saved the
necessity of visitation from S ate tax-°atherer«, the
people would have reason to be grateful to that ex-
tent, and would hail the measure of distribution as
a great blessing
As to breach of faith, be would be glad to know
whoie good fa.th was pledged Was it that of Ihe
friends of distribution? They did not want any
restrictive clause If gentlemen talk of stipula
tions, he would be glad to know who made tVm
According to the Senator's own showing, no stipu-
lation was made with him—he, at least, cannot say
any faith was broken witkh.m.
He never regarded this distribution act m any
other light than that of an act of common and or-
dinary legislation, subject to future revision and
correction It is very true that, at Ihe time of
passing it, the friends of the measure, in order to
carry it earlier than they o'herwise could carry i ,
were, for the present, content to modify it so as to
insure a sufficient number of votes for Us passage,
but surely that was not to preclude them, when
ever they should have a majority strong enough to
amend the act, from expunging the obnoxious
clause forced upon them by the circumstance of
the moment. D d the S'nntor mean to contend
that an act is to be perpetual, or even to continue
a moment longer in full force than Congress
chooses, when prepared to repe?l or mod f, it1
There was no pledge—no violated faith All par
ties got by this act just what they could get, and
no more. Such, too, must be Ihe case now, in re
lation to any modificalion Congress may cboo e to
make.
It seemed to him strange lhat any doubt should
be entertained as to the import of the proviso now
under consideration
What is the fact? Tnat Congress is called upon
to pass a law continuing the revenue laws now ex-
isting for one month What is fair, on such an
occasion, with regard to Ihe fnends and opponents
of distribution1 That the operatic n cf the act of
1841 m relation to distribution, sh u'd be mereiy
suspended during the rise of revenue after 30th of
June, 1842, for one month pending the adjustment
of the whole ques'ion If the compromise act
were to be carried out, in full, on the 1st of July,
would not the duü s be 5, 6, or 7 per cent higher
than 20 per cent, ffijdei the home valuation and
cash duties?
It was but for o«e short month Anl was it
right that this temporary act snould be alloved to
suspend the opera i u ot a great national distribu-
tion act so long agitated and so solemn y enacted?
The proviso will corttnue in operation—so will the
distribution act How, then, could gentlemen con
tend that it would hive the effect of a repetí?
This act will expire on the 1st of August If then
the duty should be higher than 20 per cent, how
can the distribution be raadeafer thai, without
seme fresh enactment, or duaes fall down to 20 per
cent."?
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

It was impossible, he conceived, to have any
other viev/ of the nutter, if gentlemen would but
collate all the laws in existence on the subject.
He hoped the bill would be passed to-day.
Mr WALKER said he had listened attentively
to the construction which the Senator from Ken-
tucky [Mr CRiTTtNDEN,] had attempted to give
to this bill, and he would acknowledge that,
if he could bring his mind to beheve that tne pro-
viso would have no othei effect than merely to
postpone the payment of ihe distrib jtion. fund until
the 1st day of August, leaving the provision in the
distribution bill uninfluenced in any other way, he
should certainty be in favor of ihe bill as it came
from the House But he was co-npelled to "-ay
that all the arguments he had heard on this point
bad failed to convince him
The Senator fiom Kentucky, with a view te
avoid the conclusion that the amendment now
proposed should have any other efUct than lha<-
which it purported upon Us face, stated that it
merely provid d that the distribution act should be
modified so as to postpone, until the 1-4 of August,
Ihe payment of the land fund This was the very
thing thathefMr W )comphmedof Thepayment
of the fund was t> be postponed, ard, in the mean
time, the money must rcmam in abeyance— her ght
of the States to receive any portion of Ihe proceeds
of the sales of tbe public lands, during that penod
when a higher rate of du íes than 20 percent v. as
levied, should cease—ihe right Oi the General
Governm nt should accrue, and ftsten upon this
fund—and that it should stand upon the same
basis as any other source of revenue This would
be the effect of a mere postponement of the opera-
tion of the distribution act to the 1st of August, or,
if they had merely raised th° du'ies above 20 per
cent, and gone no further, the operation of suen an
act isojld have been simply to suspend Ihe distri-
bution during that period But, by this acr, they
had, in the fiist place, raised the du >es above 20
per cent , a id th y then came in and dec <trr-d thit
it should not have thi effect; but that, instead of
lctttng Ihe proceels of ihe public land sales go
back, as pr vided b/ the distribution act, to tha
treasury of ihe Gen°ral Gjvernmen , the d?y of
payment merely should be postponed until the 1st
day of August, at whieh time distrioution should
take place, notwithstanding the dulie? had been
raised shove 20 per cent Couid it be denied that,
if an act were pas cd raising the duties to 2>
per cent, to continue for a partieu'ar period,
and it was declared ihal it should not ha?e
such an effect upon the distribution act as to bung
back the land fund to Ihe publi- treisury, apd then
a su sequent art «ere pa sel, raising the rate of
duties u1! lusher, and continuing the high rate
permanently—ibat the distribution would go on,
notwitnstanding, in the bill last passed, theie might
not be a «ingle word in relation to the distruution?
Gent'emen declared that they had not rep aled the
proviso of the distribution law, but if they had
not done so in so many word-, they had modified
the enactment m «uch a manner as to tike away
the pena ty in a'l tirne to come And «here waj
the diffetence be ween pn abso ute repea1 and such
a modification cf the provision as oerrri" dutrs
abo\e twenty percent to be levied, and ft the
same time to perrm ihe d stnbution to go on? Here,
then, was the point Tncy tifst raised the duties
above twenty per cett, ana if they had stopped
there, d sfibuuon would have ceased But they
were not con ent with this, but went on to declare
that tie i <_n c mem shou d not have that effect
Did hey no , thtis, dispense with the penalty which
vas to be incurred upon th* raising of the duties?
And hovirg <nce dispensed with it, they would

h?, of course, fe t o uad to vae a°ainst Ihe amend-
ment
Mr. BUCHANAN said he did not r se for ti e
purpose of enuring into the general debate, but
merely to present to the Senate a d sdnct view of
ihe question before them He would make a sin-
gle observation upon the question as to whether the

amendment preposed by the Senator from Main 
[Mr Evans] would operate as a permanent repeal
of the provis-o to the sixth section of the distribu-
tion act. He had, on yesterday, expressed the
opinion that such would not be the case, and that
opinion remained unaltered. And he believed that
no person, after a careful perusal of the amend-
ment, could place any other construction upon it
than he had done But he had risen at present
merely to state the true operation and effect of the
proposed amendment.
In his opinion there was but little different be-
tween the amendment and the proviso wh'ch it
propt sed to strike out Under the bill as itcime
from tre Hou e, the first instalment under the dis-
tribution law would be payable lo the States on
the 1st day of July, whilst ihe amendment of the
Senator fiom Mame would postpone the payment
until the 1st of Augu«t. This was the whole dif-
ferenea If Senators supposed that the amend-
ment changed the original bill in any other partic-
ular, they were mistaken
The great question still remained, whether any
portion of the proceeds of Ihe public lands ought to
be distributed, in violation of the proviso to the
sixth section of the distribution law? and this ques-
tion was as fairly raised by Ihe Senator's amend-
ment as it had been by tbe proviso to the bill as it
e^me from the House The avowed and mani-
fest purpose of the amendment was to save to the
Sta es ihe first instalment under the disaribut on
law, notwithstanding the bill to which it was an-
nexed increased the duties on imports to a rate
above twenty per cent If this bill were to become
a law before the 1st day of July,-without any pro-
viso whatever, the dtstnbu ion of the instalment,
which would o herwi.e have become due on that
d<ty, would be suspended and gone This bill, then,
m any event, whether the proviso from the House
or the amendment rf ihe Senator from Maine shall
prevail, will «aire the first instalment for the Sta e&.
The amendment will accomplish this purpose as
effesludlly as the proviso Aom ihe House Both
equally preserve the right, and pievent ih  forfeit-
ure It was in vain for S nators to attempt to
evade tne question of principle by an) such modi-
fication of the original bill as the amendment pro-
posed
I a levenue bill raising the duties to 40 or 50
P'l cent were to become a law before the 1 tday
of August, and if it were even silent on the sub-
j<c < f distribution, th rignt to this first instalment
would be irrevocably fixed, and it must be paid
over to the States on that day The right is not
affected by this amendment, bet, to use ii<s own
lirguaoe the piyment merrly " s susppnded and
postponed until the 1st day of Augu*., 1842 "
In point of princi le, then, the question arises as
much upon this amendment, as if it were a pro-
position aDSolut ly to reoeal the proviso to the
s xth section of Ihe dic ribution law The ques-
u< n, shall the operation of this provi o le sus-
pended tor <ne month, and in regard to one in-
stalment, in/o'ves the principle as effectual^ as if
the propos t on wer- tosurp" id it forever It is tiue,
tnat the interest to be effected would not beso
great, but the pnneiole wh ch must covern, is the
same in both cases The amendment of the Sen-
a or f om Mane, then, is less obnoxious than the
original bid, only because it extends the time of
pavment for oh" month, and this indu'gence is
given in ihe avowed hope (hit the general revenue
b.ll, which we expect from th  Bouse, will con-
lain a clause to repeal absolutely the proviso to
the - xth sec ion of the distribution lav This,
then, is ihe favoiable moment to decide the ques-
tion, and fortunate it is that it arises upon a bill of
eoTnpira lvely small importance
