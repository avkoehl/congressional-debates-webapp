WARRENSBURG, November 16, 1864-2 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Scouts all returned from Missouri River. They scoured the country through Greenton Valley, La Fayette County, and swept the Missouri River from Wellington to Sibley; thence through Snibar Hills down Blackwater. No guerrillas found. The report of large numbers being at Wellington unfounded. A small squad swam river at Camden and seventeen crossed in flat-boats at Sibley few days since. Scout destroyed boat. There is saw-mill just above Sibley on north side river, where skiffs, boats, &amp;c., are made. It should be looked after. There are about thirty-five guerrillas in Snibar Hills and Greenton Valley. Will entrap them if possible. Guerrillas bands going south. Sixty let Snibar Hills recently. District generally very quiet.

Colonel, Commanding District.

By order, &c.:
