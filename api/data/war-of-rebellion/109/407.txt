INDIANAPOLIS, July 13, 1863-11.15 a. m.

General WALLACE,

North Vernon:

Part of the rebel force reported at Dillsborough, on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, and the rest in the vicinity of Sunman, on the Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad. We have got them well hemmed in. Tell Hughes to get everything he can on horseback and co-operate with Hobson. The river is well guarded. I am sending two companies of cavalry to Sunman. The chances are good. Mount everything you can and send to Hughes, at Osgood.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 13, 1863-4.20 p. m.

General WALLACE,

North Vernon:

The rebels marched through Dover for Harrison, on Ohio line, to-day; some thousands, with artillery. Burnside called on me for all spare troops. Am just sending three regiments to Ohio. Keep your command in shape for quick return to this place. Please let me know what you propose with your command at Osgood.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
