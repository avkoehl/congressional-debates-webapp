CONSTITUTION OP RHODE ISLAND.
Mr. ANTHONY. Mr. President, in the
beginning of yesterday's proceedings some
petitions Avere presented by the Senator from
Kansas, [Mr. Pomeroy.] Being detained a
few moments in my committee-room, I did not
come into the Chamber until the petitions had
been presented and the Senator was conclud-
ing the brief statement with which he accom-
panied them. I was not, therefore, fully
informed of their character. Those petitions
purport to come from the State which I have
the honor in part to represent, and they set
forth that the constitution of that State is not
only oppressive upon a considerable number
of its citizens, but that it contravenes the Con-
stitution of the United States.
I notice that the signatures to each of these ,,
petitions seem to be largely in one handwrit-
ing, which may be only a remarkable coinci- |
dence. |
I had not an opportunity to make any reply
yesterday to the allegation, nor do I propose
now to go into a discussion upon a matter over
which Congress has no control whatever; but
I cannot allow one expression which the Sen-
ator from Kansas employed to pass over with-
out affirming that there is nothing in the con-
stitution of Rhode Island that contravenes the
Constitution of the United States or the laws
made in pursuance thereof.
Rhode Island is a law-abiding State. She
has proved her fidelity to the principles of law
and order in a way that no other State has had
an opportunity to do, and under circumstances
which make-the triumph most honorable to her
and most valuable to the cause of liberty reg-
ulated by law.
If the Senator from Kansas shall, upon full
reflection, conclude, as I think he will not, to
introduce the bill which he suggested yester-
day, we shall have no difficulty in defending,
here or elsewhere, the constitution and the
laws which the people of Rhode Island have
seen fit to ordain tor themselves, which con-
i cern themselves only, and which they, and they
alone, have the right to alter.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.

Mr. WILLEY. I present the petition of
John Anderson, of Rutherford county, North
Carolina. 1 know that the name of this gen-
tleman falls gratefully on the ears of many a
gallant soldier of the Union, whom he con-
cealed and^ed, at the peril of his own life, as
they escaped from southern prisons. I have a
long liBt of the names of such in my*hands
accompanying this petition. Mr. Anderson,
! of his own mere motion, desires that certain
! of his neighbors may be relieved from their
: political disabilities. Some of those neighbors,
when he was driven from his home and was an
exile, although engaged in the rebellion them-
selves, took him beneath their roofs and kindly
fed and concealed him. He desires now, as a
return for their kindness, that their disabilities
be removed. I take great pleasure in pre-
senting the petition, and I move that it be re-
ferred to the select Committee on the Removal
of Political Disabilities.
The motion was agreed to.
