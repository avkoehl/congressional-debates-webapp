Gentlemen seem to «speak is if no one had read and understood
Mr Jefferson's waling  but themselves, and quote slips from,
and. fragmen s of, his It ttrr* written some fifiy years ago, before
the existence of a United States Bank    I have been amused
to see the dreadful war are of worth canted on among the
Southern State rights politicians, who dispute upon subtleties
too refined to be perceived by my mental virion    One descants
upon constitutional law, and all eagerly listen,  in hope to

so remaikable m the South, where all die imaginative children
of the Son, and wheie all possess the copia verborum in an
eminent degree, he soon runs foul of some other opinion of
Mr   jeffeison, or some other and foreign subject    Yes and
another more Mercuiy footed p ige is posted, to tell the first to

What a bombastic Englishman once said of Homer, they thmk
true of Jefferson-
Read Homer once, and you can read no more,
Fo) all books else appeal =o mean, so poor,
Verse will seem pi ose, but still persist and read,
And Homer will be a'l the books you need

man dare ^peak, thmk, 01 brea he, without pioducing the au
thorny ofMr   hileison  and hi, is lead out ot the State rights
party      I hey cail to my mind an anecdote which of < mred in
my own ">tate on the death of Alexandei Hamilton, m the best
days of Maryland hospitality, befoie she was governed, as she
now 1-3, by unclea and aunts, who age all united by eithei afíini
ty or piopmqmty, who fill all places, and hold the reigns of
Government m Eheir feeble and effeminate grasp—foi Maryland
is pretty much like the i est of the Southern State     They have
all been, for the last ten years like so many bairels of frozen
cider—the spmt has not escaped, but it has become concentra!
ed, some o them now show signs of leanimation, and enliven
mg feelings are beginning to pervade them, and we may hope
thatevon 'Rip Van Winkle J <Noith Carolina) will in time
open his wondering eves    But to my anecdote    The news
reach d a coterie of thorougngomg Federal ists, who were dm

were flowing m equal creams, all expie% ed, in general excla

quent mspeakingofthej owei^ of that great man's mind—of the
great services he had ten lei d to the country, and the heavy
loss which the na ion had ¡sustained, and how much they la
mentedit     At length, Umm^ Bailey, the brothei ofthe Attor
nertíeneial of Maiyland, who was remarkable for a high order
of mtellci t when he woul i ventuie to exercise it, setting down
his empty wine glass, said to his bevy of friends, that he had
listened to the cxpiessions of gnef which the «¡ad news hid
called Asm them, but he felt that his gnef was greater than
t hens, be ause bis loss wa> gieatei  in the death oi Hamilton
f r 3$ long as Hamilton lived, (said he) he had never been put
O the lab _>ran1 trouble of investigating questions for himself,
an 1 that, as Hamilton was dead he now, alas, would be forced
to the due necessity ofthiukmg lorbmrell
I could but thmk, sine1 this discission has commenced if
Mr JefltMbOn had not leit behind him some two volumes of
State Papéis, ote volumeofí one pondence and hit. "Notes on
Virginia bow aw lull/ annoyed some of the Virginia politicians
w  ild bo, it driven, like Tom Bailey, to think for themselves
What, w mid these gentlemen do if the point d'appui of (heir
poll i^al lever were destroyed*
An able membei fi om Virginia m formed us, last nignt, that Tie

mine it by the test of real lift Will atraveilei always keep his
eye on the polai s n^ It he should direct his gaze continually
that way m his journey, he will soon find that furs would add
to inscomfort, he would next find that the white bear and the
wandering Indian would be the an'y hvmff things about him,
and the ny\t ^ ep lie would find himself plunging into Symmes's
arctic hole Will the pi udent and skilful mariner look alone at
the noith star, lndueetmg his vessel's way over the trackless

sir asüonomy and navigation teach him to point his glass, at
times, to all the bu 'ht stars m the zodiac and the power of hu
man ieason makes them subservient to its control
So I bhould fa,n thmk the practical American statesman should

W en Jefferson embarked in the glonous cause of the Revo
lution did he take Solon 01 Lymrgu-, Sidney or Hampden, for
his model of greatness? Did he take Locke or Milton as the
text books of his creed1* No <=n, he did not He read all that
patuots had written he re id deeply the volumes of human na
tuie and then, sir, he dipped hispen into his own mind, and
wiote the ltn rtortal Declaration ot Independence He had no
model, darins to hink a id to act for Ivmsel!, he made himself
gr i1 as i e wiH                                            ,               -,,   _,

heir Mr Jtffersoni .wine quote', to effect eveiy narrow and
«elfish purpose Hts i une h the property of the whole nation,
and is not placed in the hands of a few southern pohti
mns Mr Jefferson had faults as all men have, but Mr Jef
iUson was a man of enlarged ande-ipansive mind And if any
supernatural power could resuscitate his body with the mag c
wand of one of old, as we read in solemn history, and present
him living before ua, he would rebuke his friends for using his
name, as it has been, on many occasions                          TT
Mr Jefferson doubted, before the first Bank of the United
States was established, whether it was constitutional to establish
such an institution But did he advise General Washington to
put his veto upon itf No, su He cautions him against using
the veto—he urges him to respect the representatives of the
people    'ihts he did in the last sentence of his. letter to Gtme
ral Washington, m 1791 He -ajp [ It must be ad Id1, how

the Constitution and obejed the la\v«t When the Bank i)f the
United States was e&tabh^hed, he acquiesced m dt ierence and
with cheerfulness And in 1804, aftei he was exalted to the
Presidency, he signed a bill authorizing the bank to establish
branches in theTeiutories If he had not suriendeied his first
opinion, he placed himself m the attitude of being euuty ofba^e
