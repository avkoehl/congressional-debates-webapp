Brigadier General L. S. BAKER,

Goldsborough:

GENERAL: The indications seem to favor active movements by the enemy against you from New Berne. The commanding general desires you, therefore, to hold your troops in hand and to use all possible means to keep fully advised. Your cavalry should be kept in the enemy's immediate presence, and be required to send daily reports of observations, and make occasional dashes on the flanks or rear of the Federals to harass them and retard their operations. To accomplish these objects it will be necessary to concentrate it as far as practicable

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
