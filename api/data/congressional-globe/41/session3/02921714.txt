Treasury Department,
Washington, D. C., February 27,1871.
Sir : I am directed by the Secretary to inform you,
in reply to your note ot this morning, that the amounts
paid for express charges for the year ending June
o0,1871, on stamps, fractional currency, greenbacks,
and national bank notes, to the express companies,
are, as nearly as can be ascertained, as follows : on
greenbacks and fractional currency, $64,986 80; on
national bank notes, 32,112 75; on internal revenue
stamps, $19,071 45; in all, $86,171.
I believe, however, that the item for transportation
of national bank notes is not correct; but I have not
had an opportunity to examine all the accounts, for
the reason that you desired the information imme-
diately.
Very respectfully,
J. II. SAVILLE, Chief Clerk.
Hon. William Lawrence, M. C.
[Extract from the annual report of the Superintend-

acting Secretary ot tho Treasury of the 3d of Sop- t
tombr;r last, I have the honor fo submit herewith a
report of the operations of this bureau,during the
fiscal > e tr ending June .'>0, 1870.
There have boon delivered by this bureau com-
pleted and pcrioct notes and securities amounting
to &508,411,o2d, and 31,453,400 perfect customs and
internal revenue stamps; also sundry other work

The question being taken on Mr. Law-
rence's amendment, it was disagreed to.
The (Jierk read as follows ;
For the erection of a Government building at
Montgomery, Alabama, which shall be built of
brick, and upon plans which will insure its com-
pletion for the sum of $100,000, the halt of which is
hereby appropriated, $50,000: Provided, That no
money hereby appropriated shall be used for tho
purpose mentioned until a valid title to the land
for tho site of such building shall be vested in the
United States, and until tho State shall duly relin-
quish to the United States the right to tax said site
or the property of the United States thereon.
Mr. AMBLER. I raise the point of order
on that, section that it is not in pursuance of
existing law.
The SPEAKER. The Chair sustains the
point of order.
Mr. BUCKLEY. T hope the gentleman
will not insist upon the pt.ii't of order.
Mr. AMBLER. I do iioist on it.
Mr. BUCKLEY. This building has been
recommended by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, and plans and spec ligations have been
made out by the supervising architect of the
Treasury.
T move that the rules be suspended, and that
the paragraph be considered in order.
The question was taken; and there wftre-r-
ayes 89, noes 33,
So (two thirds having voted in favor thereof)
the rules were suspended, and the paragraph
was considered in order.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I move,
in order to make this section correspond with
the previous sections, to strike out the word
"valid " and to insert after the word w title^
the words u in fee-simple."
The amendment was agreed to.
LEAVE TO PRINT.
Mr. MAYNARD. I ask that my colleague
[Mr. Smith] have leave to print some remarks
on the amendment he offered a short time ago.
[See Appendix.]
There was no objection.
SUNDRY CIVIL APPROPRIATION BILL.
The Clerk read the following section:
Kor the erection of a Government building at Litf }e
Rock, Aikansas, which shall be built of brick, and
upon plans which will insure its completion ior tho
sum hereby appropriated, $50,000.
Mr. DAWES. I desire to offer an amend-
ment to the paragraph which has just been
read.
Mr. BUECHAED. I raise the point of
order on the paragraph.
The SPEAKER. The Chair sustains the
point of order.
Mr. ROOTS. The amendment is merely
for the purpose of correcting a misprint. The
estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury was
for $214,000. The committee agreed to allow
the limit to be $100,000, §50,000 to be at
once appropriated; but a misprint, leaving out
$100,000, leaves it a limit of only $60,000.
Let us have the $100,000 limit at least when
it ought to be double that. The city of Little
Hock lias tripled its population in the last five
years, and is growing with a rapidity equaled
only by the soundness and excellence of' the
growth. There is no Government building
there; rents are high. The thrift of the city
and economy of administration 'demand the
erection of a building worth at least $100,000.
I move to suspend the rules, that the paragraph
may be considered in order.
The question was taken on suspending the
rules; and there were—ayes 87, noes 88.
So (two-thirds having voted in favor thereof)
the rules were suspended, and the paragraph
was considered in order.
Mr. DAWES. 1 move to amend by insert-
ing after the word "appropriated," in line one
hundred and sixty-eight, the words " $100,000,
the half of which is hereby appropriated."
In this connection I desire to state that the
whole responsibility of jril these public build-
ings rests upon the Treasury Department, and
not upon the Committee on Appropriations.
My distinguished friend from Ohio, [Mr. Law-
rence,] who is a member of the Committee
on Appropriations, having absented himself
from their meetings during their consideration
of these matters, comes in here at the last
moment and denounces appropriations with-
out having permitted the committee to enjoy
the benefit of his wisdom until this late day.
I submit that if he would exert himself in the
committee in the consideration of these mat-
ters, and lay the blame of this extravagance,
if there be extravagance, where it belongs, and
not upon the Committee on Appropriations,
he would show a better appreciation of what
is due to fidelity in the discharge of his duty
than he now manifests.
Mr. COX. I wish to say a word in reply to
my friend from Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes.]
If X can get order enough to be heard, 1 want
to call the attention of the House to the fact
that here is a bill to construct fifteen new
buildings.
Mr. LOGAN. We should like to hear the
gentleman.
Mr. COX, (leaving his seat.) I will go
nearer my friend from Illinois. I have said
that this was to provide for the erection of
fifteen new buildings, and we start them with
an appropriation of $1,500,000. They will
cost $15,000,000 anyhow before they are com-
pleted. The gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Dawes,] like an honest, straightforward
man, tells you this.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I call my
colleague to order. I object to his going over
to the Republican side of the House.
TheSPEAKER. The gentleman from New
York [Mr. Cox] will address the House from
his seat.
