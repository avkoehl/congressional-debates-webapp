HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Folly Island, S. C., November 18, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded for the consideration of the General-in-Chief.

An advance on Branchville, from the coast, would at once transfer the theater of war into South Carolina. The subject is one which has been discussed, pro and con, ever since this coast was occupied by our forces in November, 1861. There is, perhaps, no point where so much could be gained on so short a line of operations. Two line of railroad would be cut by reaching Branchville. The bull of Bragg's and Lee's army would doubtless have to be encountered. The project is not without its objectionable features, strategically.
