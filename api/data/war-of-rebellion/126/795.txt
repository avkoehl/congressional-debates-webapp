The account is then placed on file until its proper turn for examination shall have arrived, when it is delivered to the examining clerk. Each voucher is then carefully examined under the orders and regulations in force at the time the expenditure was made; and where any expenditure was made not in accordance with regulations, such fact is noted and placed upon the list of exceptions taken to the account.

In order to ascertain the precise amount paid out on account of the different items chargeable to this fund, and analysis of each account is made by the examining clerk. In order to keep a correct record of this,and also to show exactly how each officer's account stands for each month, a book, known as "Volunteer Service Expenditure," is kept, headed as follows.*

So that a correct record might be kept of each account, from the time it is received at this office until it is sent to the Second Auditor, it was found necessary to open a book known as "Record of Accounts of Disbursing Officers, Volunteer Service," head as follows:*

The property return of each disbursing officer, accounting for all property received and expended during the month, is also examined at the same time and then filed with the account.

When the exceptions taken to the account are completed and copied into the Exception Book, they are filed with the account, officially acknowledged, and the account is then referred to the Second Auditor of the Treasury for final settlement.

A copy of the exceptions taken is also sent to the disbursing officer, and in case he make explanations to the exceptions, they are forwarded to the Second Auditor of the Treasury.
