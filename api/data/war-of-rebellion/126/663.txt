Enlistments for the naval service and Marine Corps.

On the 3rd of May, 1861, the President issued a call, in which be directed the enlistment of 18,000 seamen.

Section 8 of the act approved July 4, 1864, required that all persons in the naval service of the United States who entered said service during the present rebellion, and who were not credited to the quota of any town, district, ward, or State, by reason of their being in said service and not enrolled prior to February 24, 1864, should be enrolled and credited to the quota of the town, ward, district, or State in which they respectively resided, upon satisfactory proof of their residence made to the Secretary of State.

In carrying into effect this law of Congress the Secretary of War decided that men enlisted in the Navy should be credited to the State in which they enlisted, unless it was proved that they properly belonged elsewhere; and for the purpose of determining what credits the several States were entitled to, under the law given above, the Secretary of War appointed commissioners, consisting of the Governor of the State and an officer of the Army. The aggregate of credits allowed by the commissioners for enlistments in the Navy from April 15, 1861, to February 24, 1864, was 67,334. The distribution among the different States appears in a table presented on the following page.

For men enlisted into the Marine Corps between February 24, 1864, and June 30, 1865..................................... 2,536
