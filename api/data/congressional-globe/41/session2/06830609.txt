prefer, however, to give the statement of Mr.
Dawes:
" The House will recollect, Mr. Chairman, that in
some remarks I submitted at the early part of tho
session I took occasion to compare the estimates
made by this Administration for the coming fiscal
year with the estimates made by the past Adminis-
tration for the present year, furnished to the Houso
of Representatives for then information, when I told
the House that the balance was alarmingly against
tho estimates for the coming yoar. As I have said,
this attracted some attention and some remark, ana
wasdeniedin different quarters. It hasso happened,
Mr. Chairman, that no two gentlemen since that time
have been able to agree upon what was exactly tho
sum or amount of estimates made by the last Admin-
istration for this year and the amount of estimates
made by this Administration for thenext year, every
gentleman commonting on them having a different
bum total for the amount. The Treasury Depart-
ment has therpfore felt justified in employing one of
its mostskilliul acoountants in stating the ostimates
lor this yoar, ma.de last year, and tho estimates for
next year, mado this year; and the result of that
investigation I take pleasure in laying before tho
House with all its details.
'" It will bo seen that the balance in favor of the
estimates of tho present Administration for the next
fiscal year over those made by tlio last Administra-
tion for this fiscal year is $i8,0D8,245 12. It is but lair
1o state that this difference is found by the Treasury
Department correcting taeir own mistakes in their
estimates submitted to this House to the amount of
$32,000,000. All these mistakes in the estimates wero
made against themselves. There is aeorrection also
of the estimates made for the present year bv tho
last Administration, an omission having been found
of about nine million dollars."
Yet %vith a pretended mistake, first of
$7,000,000 and next of $32,000,000, we do
lioi hear that any of the so called blunderers
have been either dismissed or reprimanded.
The whole thing is transparent j it is a bold,
unblushing attempt to conceal from the coun-
tiy the real facts, which not only so show no
diminution of expenditures but a large increase.
I give a comparative statement of the amount
of tho bills passed for last year and so far for
this. It is as follows:

lars has to b« thus paid, but $1,000,000 was
stricken from the bill, and it appears that much
less is appropiiuted, and whatever is taken by
indirection and concealed is supposed to be
saved, and to be in favor of economy, as the
people aie not expected to find it out, as it
does not appear in the papers. .
It is a part of the same system whereby tho
Secretaiy of the Treasury is lauded as a great
financier, because he has bought a considerable
number of the five-twenty bonds. So far from
being entitled to credit ho is greatly to blame
for n"ot buying at least $20,000,000 more with

the money he has expended for that purpose.
Pour hundred million dollars is annually wrung
by taxation from the people, and poured into
the Treasury. The Secretary shows that he
had on hand at the beginning of the year over
$102,000,000. Say that $300,000,000 of the
$400,000,000 collected this year has been spent,
there still remained $100,000,000 to buy bonds
with. The bonds were payable, as we all know,
in legal-tender notes, and $100,000,000 of bonds
ought to have been paid for with it. Instead of
that, he bought bonds at an average of eight-
een and a half per cent, premium, claiming
that they were payable in gold, and $20,000,000
of the money ot the people was thus illegally
put into the pockets of a few bondholders ;
yet this is called great financiering, and the
people shout because a hired press sound the
praise of the Secretary. It is to be hoped the
people will learn to look behind and beyond
professions at the actual facts ; if they do they
will find that extravagance, and not economy,
is the governing principle of the dominant
party.

REMARKS OF HON. JOHN D. STILES,
OF PENNSYLVANIA,
In the House of Representatives,
May 25, 1870,
On tho joint resolution (S. 11. No. 121) authorizing
the Northern Pacific Railway Company to issue
its bonds for tho construction of its road and to
secure tho same by mortgage, and also extending
tho line of the road and tho land grant already
made to the company, &c.
Mr. STILES. Mr. Speaker, hills and reso-
lutions without number have been introduced
in the two branches of the present Congress
granting lands for the purpose of conslructing
railroads. A great number of these bills have
gone to committees and will never be reached
for consideration. It is to be hoped that in
tho present embarrassed state of the country
this class of legislation will be well considered.
I cannot, for one, yield my convictions of duty
to the urgent appeals made by members of
this House anil persons who represent these
mammoth corporations, and must vote against
this and all kindred schemes. In earlier times
there seemed to be a necessity for grants of
land to rapidly-increasing western States and
Territories. Congress with lavish hands con-
ferred titles to almost countless acres for pub-
lic improvements. The country was then
without capital to build railroads, and it was
commendable in the Government to aid in these
movements, such as the grant to the State of
Illinois.
But, sir, what was right and just then is not
now a charity or a benefit. The capitalists of
the eastern Statc-s and of foreign countries are
pressing upon us these bills for the purpose of
making double fortunes, one out of their own
capital and another out of the Government, by
receiving as a gift the great prairies of the
West. What was right in the early settlements
is now an evil of startling importance. The
Government has granted for the purposes of
education, at different times, to States and
Territories, over sixty million acres lor public
schools, educational purposes, colleges, uni-
versities ; and for agricultural colleges, over ten
million of acres. In most of these grants there
was a necessity for the advancement of public
education. Many of these grants date back to
early periods when lands were plenty and we
needed the western States not only to be peo-
pled, but required also that a system of educa-
tion should bo encouraged.
But, sir, look at the official reports of the
land grants within the last twenty years to cor-
porations, private and public. Within that
period 185,890,79-1 acres have been given away,
to make for the recipients of the Government's
bounty the most colossal fortunes in this coun-
try. Of the grants to within the last twenty
years 160,000,000 acres have been granted
within the last ten years, and since the Radi-
cal party have had complete control of the Ex-
ecutive and both branches of Congress. These
lands would make three States larger than tho
States of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York.
In these days of recklessness, extravagance,
and dishonesty, the faithful Representative will
pause long before he will vote to place in the
hands of speculators the remaining public lands,
the heritage and property of all the people, tu
the men whose fortunes startle and amaze us
at the very mention of their possessions.
The plea of the necessity of making grants
for the purpose of uniting the Pacific and At-
lantic States bj' a railway has ceased to exist;
and, sir, it never did exist, because the pres-
ent railroad across the continent was built upon
the credit of ihe Government and with its credit
and its bonds. I will not take the time to go
over each bill now before Congress upon this
subject, but shall confine myself more particu-
larly to the bill before us.
The Northern Pacific Railway Company was
chartered in 180-1. Its charter gave a grant
through the Territories of every alternate sec-
tion in a breadth of eighty miles, being forty
alternate sections to the mile. Forty alternate
sections to the mile make twenty-five thousand
six hundred acres to the mile, and twenty-live
thousand six hundred acies at $1 25 per acre
will make a subsidy of $32,000 per mile.
Nor is this all. After giving a subsidy of
$02,000 per mile the road is given the free
right of way of four hundred feet in width
throughout the length of its truuk and branches.
Nor does tho grant stop here ; in addition to
the unexampled powers and franchises given
to this company, it presents to this company
all the land it requires for its depots, lna.ebine-
shops, and other necessary buildings for the
use of their road. In tho original eharter ail
the material for the construction of the road
was permitted to be taken from the public
lands without charge. All tho minerals found
upon the lands given to this company, which
must be of great value, were to be owned and
be absolutely the property of the company.
In the original grant these munificent gifls
utterly amaze and bewilder us. And wo are
asked to add by this bill new privileges, and
give a large part of the remaining public lands.
The question involved in this bill is exciting
public attention, and the people are everywhere
asking what right have you to give to these mam-
moth corporations the people's land? What
right have you to impose taxation to meet the
expenses of the Government,, and take from the
people that which would yield millions for the
payment of the public debt? While I rejoice in
the rapid, steady, and successful development
of our country and its unexampled resources,
standing as a Representative of my people 1
never can and never will submit to the unjust
demand made upon us by the corporations that
are attempting to control both branches o:
Congress, in attempts to add millions of acres
of the lands belonging to the people to their
possessions. You cannot now all'ord to be
generous. The national debt and the useless
waste of money by the present Administration
severely burden and oppress all classes of peo-
ple. As we go from these llalls to meet the
people we must meet their censure, if we sur-
render up the public lands prooosed in this
bill.
Let the Government retain them; let the
Government have the power at all times to
give to the actual settler our public lands at
the lowest possible price. Do nut place the
