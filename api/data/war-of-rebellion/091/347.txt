Assistant Adjutant-General.

RECTORTOWN, VA., October 12, 1864.

(Received 12.30 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have received your dispatch concerning the placing of prominent secessionists on the trains.* When troops first arrived here, Mosby gave out that all the men were to be carried arrested and sent to Washington. There are, in consequence, but a few old and infirm men left here. I think in a few days the others will return, and I can then make the necessary arrests.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

RECTORTOWN, VA., October 12, 1864-9.30 p.m.

(Received 9.35 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Nothing yet heard from Sixth Corps. The first train from Alexandria to-day has arrived here safely; the other trains have not yet arrived; they are supposed to be at White Plains. Nothing of importance to-day.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
