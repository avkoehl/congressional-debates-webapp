As you are interested in this work as well as myself, you would oblige me if you would give the officer in charge of the saw-mills at Kingston orders to supply such lumber as may be required for by my engineer officer, who, if he can get it, [will] have it floated down the rived to this place.

I a, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
