JACKSON, MISS., November 18, 1862.

GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

A telegram received this morning states:

Twelve transports with three gunboats loaded with troops passed Friar's Point this evening.

Large numbers of troops are reported to have left Helena by transports, and artillery and cavalry moving down river by land. Have sent courier to General Holmes. Should not General Bragg move directly to threaten the rear of large force in front of us? I should be re-enforced at once.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

ABBEVILLE, November 19, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Dispatch from Friar's Point, 16th, states enemy moving down the river. Thirteen transports, one tug, and one gunboat passed at 2 p. m.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

SALTILLO, MISS., November 19, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Old troops left Rienzi and raw troops have taken their place. The same seems to be the case at Corinth. The enemy's picket lines are down in close to the above places and no passing allowed. Do not think that any new troops are now arriving at Corinth. Cavalry picket force at Rienzi and infantry at Glendale lately increased to a strength greater than formerly. Pickets on north and northeast sides of Corinth drawn in to less than a mile of the place.

C. R. BARTEAU,

Colonel.
