FORT MONROE, June 11, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

We have material ready for extension of telegraph from Jamestown Island, by way of Swan's Point, Cabin Point, Garysville, to the Appomattox. Can we now have the necessary protection and assistance for our building parties and the line? There appears to be call for it now; will hurry it up.

JUNE 11, 1864.

General WEITZEL;

Don't you think it would be well to construct a strong redoubt on the high ground beyond the ravine in Turner's front? It is a good position for enfilading the enemy's lines.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 11, 1864-8.25 a. m.

General GILLMORE:

A redoubt like the one in front of Numbers 1 would be a good think. It ought to afford no cover to an enemy, and ought to be open in rear.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Colonel Abbot will please make an examination of the high ground in front of ravine on extreme left. An escort will be necessary to make a thorough examination. Call on General Turner for it. The best position will probably be found nearly due south from Battery Numbers 4.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
