Union men generally are dissatisfied with General Brown's course toward rebel sympathizers in this section of country, permitting those that have been driven out to return among us without any appearance of reform, only tenfold more bitter and disloyal than ever they were, causing the bushwhackers to follow right upon their heels, committing all manner of depredations. On yesterday, a short distance from here, one of our most worthy citizens, a Captain Axline, was murdered in a most brutal manner.

The policy of General Brown gives Union men no protection. The people, the loyal Union men, re desirous of a change of commanders in this department or district. They are desirous, and wish, that General Ewing may be sent in the place of General Brown. General Ewing has the confidence of the people; they look upon him as the only man that understands the situation of this district of country. His appointment to this military district would be hailed with gladness by every loyal man in this section of the State.

In writing this, dear general, I am actuated by no other motives than that which I think the general good of the country requires.

With high regard, I remain, dear sir, very respectfully, yours,

C. CARPENTER.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., June 4, 1864.

Major MELTON,Commanding at Berryville, Ark.:

Six hundred men cannot subsist on Crooked Creek for any length of time, and it is not probable that they can raise so large a force. I will order one company to report to you at Berryville; you will then be able, with the home guards, to manage 500 or 600 who have no artillery. There is no objection to your falling back to White River if the citizens there would be as well protected. It is said the citizens are not trying to raise any crops. You will do as is best about removing your post to White River. Take such course as will result in producing the largest crop in that section. The company that will report to you will be one at White River.
