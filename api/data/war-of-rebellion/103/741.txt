HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Waterloo, Ala., February 18, 1865.

Major BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

MAJOR: The information obtained by Colonel Stewart from refugees is that Forrest has left Verona and gone to West Point. Mr. Ellis, sent as a guide, reports Roddey near Moulton, which is fifty miles from Eastport and further, perhaps, than the general desires the reconnaissance to proceed. I will send him along, and if Roddey or any one else comes in the way they will be brought in.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant.

General Croxton desires me to inform you that the within-mentioned expedition is the one he spoke to you about this morning, and directs that is shall be started at an early hour to-morrow, February 19, 1865.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. J. MILLER,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

WATERLOO, ALA., February 18, 1865.

Colonel R. R. STEWART,

Commanding Fifth Division, Cav. Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi:

The general commanding directs me to say, in reply to your communication of this date, that he considers a well-mounted force of 500 men amply sufficient to accomplish the design of the expedition, and desires you to send out as large effective force as practicable, keeping the whole party on one road instead of dividing the force.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. J. MILLER,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I reached here last night. It seems that four regiments of cavalry heretofore on duty in this State are ordered south. Much apprehension is felt in consequence. I go to Frankfort this afternoon to meet Governor Bramlette.
