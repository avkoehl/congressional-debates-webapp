Major-General DODGE:

Dispatch received. I have at least 25,000 bushels of corn well on the way to Denver, Julesburg, Laramie, and other points; starting more every day. Have just got out a train of fifty wagons complete, which will be sent at once to captain Turnley for General Connor. This is all I can spare just now, but will try to send him all he needs. Have got all ready for the Niobrara party and only waiting for a boat I have chartered to take all that the Alone cannot take.

I require the teams in my district. I am much embarrassed for want of transportation. The pack-mules are scarcely able to carry their saddles. We are nearly out of supplies at some points, Corn and stores should be forwarded in large quantities immediately. I dismissed the militia yesterday. I start for Julesburg Tuesday next. The escort for Evans will be ready.
