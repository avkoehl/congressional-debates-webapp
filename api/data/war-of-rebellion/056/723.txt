MISSION RIDGE, November 20, 1863.

JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President:

Have kept General Jones informed as far as I knew. The commander of my expedition has not advised me of any part of his operations. A dispatch from him about a pontoon bridge was dated yesterday, 5 miles from Knoxville. I am very much embarrassed, but repeated calls meet no response.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

MERIDIAN, November 20, 1863.

Major-General MAURY:

General Bragg wants help. Asks, if Banks being engaged elsewhere, if you can spare some force? Will give skeleton regiments, to be filled at Mobile, for your full ones. Can you make the exchange?

By command of General Johnston:

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
