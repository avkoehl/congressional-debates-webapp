Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Tullahoma:

Hearing last night of the bad condition of the road to Tullahoma I came on here direct this morning. The two regiment referred to in my letter of last night have not left, owing to want of rations. A supply train is expected in the afternoon, and so soon as General Palmer arrives I shall send General Beatty and his command to McMinville.

I should like to have more good news.

General WOOD,

First Division, Pelham:

GENERAL: We are on our way to Manchester. The couriers running both to Pelham and Tullahoma have been ordered to report to you here to-day, and the general commanding directs that you re-establish the line between department headquarters and Manchester via Hillsborough. I sent you three couriers last night, last one with news of fall of Vicksburg and overthrow of Lee's army, and ordering a salute at daylight this morning. The bearer of this, Mrs. Marshall, is the wife of our guide, and the general desires that you afford her and her aged mother Major Throckmorton's sister, every protection and if necessary a guard.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

If you have any additional orders for Sheridan, please forward them as soon as possible, so that they can reach him in time. How far should he go? And should the general have any special object in view, he can rest assured that it will be conscientiously carried out. To avoid all trouble and bar against accident, I will forward Colonel Ray three days' rations from here to-night. I have been
