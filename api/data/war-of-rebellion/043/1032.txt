THREE FOUR-GUN BATTERIES OPENED FROM THE FRONT AND RIGHT OF MY POSITION. IN THIS SPOT I HAD MOST MEN WOUNDED, AND BY MUSKETRY. AFTER OCCUPYING THE GROUND ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES, THE REBEL BATTERY ON MY RIGHT AN FRONT MOVED OFF STILL MORE TO THE RIGHT, UNDER COVER OF THE WOODS, AND TOOK UP A POSITION SO AS TO NEARLY ENFILADE MY GUNS. I HELD THIS POSITION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, BUT, THE ENEMY HAVING A CROSS FIRE WITH SEVERAL BATTERIES, I WAS FORCED TO WITHDRAW. I THEN TOOK UP A POSITION NEARLY ON A LINE WITH MY FORMER ONE, BUT BETTER COVERED BY A CORNER OF WOODS FROM THE BATTERIES IN FRONT, AND REMAINED IN THAT POSITION UNTIL RELIEVED BY A BATTERY OF THE FIRST CORPS; THEN TOOK UP A POSITION IN A WHEAT-FIELD ABOUT 500 YARDS TO THE REAR AND LEFT OF FORMER POSITION. HERE I OPENED ON A HEAVY COLUMN OF REBEL INFANTRY ADVANCING DOWN THE CARLISLE PIKE. REMAINED IN THIS POSITION UNTIL TOWARD EVENING, WHEN WE MOVED TO THE LEFT ABOUT A MILE, AND BIVOUACKED FOR THE NIGHT. IN THIS ENGAGEMENT, WHICH WAS A VERY SEVERE ONE THE BATTERY LOST 12 MEN BADLY WOUNDED AND 13 HORSES KILLED. ALL BEHAVED NOBLY. I TOOK NOTICE PARTICULARLY OF THE COOLNESS AND INTREPIDITY OF THE CHIEFS OF SECTIONS DURING THE HOTTEST OF THE FIRING. LIEUTENANT RODER BEHAVED VERY HANDSOMELY, SHOWING HIMSELF EQUAL TO EVERY EMERGENCY. BEING SHORT OF OFFICERS, FIRST SERGEANT NEWMAN AND SERGEANT PERGEL EACH COMMANDED A SECTION. OF THE OTHER NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, SERGEANTS [MICHAEL] QUINN, [JAMES] CALLANAN, [CHARLES] CRITTENDEN, [JOHN] BROTHERS, [MALACHI] KILLERN, AND WATROUS DESERVE MENTION, THE LATTER LOSING A LEG. THE BATTERY DID WELL AND I WAS HIGHLY GRATIFIED BY THE COMPLIMENTS PAID IT BY GENERAL BUFORD, COMMANDING DIVISION, AND COLONEL GAMBLE, COMMANDING BRIGADE TO WHICH THE BATTERY WAS ATTACHED. ON THE EVENING OF THE 2D, THE ATTACK COMMENCED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF WHERE MY BATTERY WAS PARKED. DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE TO RECEIVE THE ENEMY, WHO WERE DRIVING OUR SKIRMISHERS RAPIDLY. FOR WANT OF MEN, I COULD SERVE BUT FIVE GUNS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEVERE WORK OF THE 1ST, EVERY ONE SHOWED HIMSELF READY FOR A CONTINUATION ON THE MORNING OF THE 2D. WE HAD HARDLY GOT INTO POSITION WHEN AN ORDER CAME FROM GENERAL BUFORD FOR ME TO FOLLOW WITH MY BATTERY THE FIRST BRIGADE, OF HIS DIVISION, AND MARCH WITH IT TO TANEYTOWN, MD., FOR SUPPLIES AND FORAGE. REACHED TANEYTOWN ABOUT 4 P. M., AND WENT INTO CAMP.

JULY 3. -MARCHED FROM TANEYTOWN TO WESTMINSTER, MD., WHERE WE OBTAINED ONE DAY'S FORAGE.

JULY 4. -MARCHED FROM WESTMINSTER TO UNION BRIDGE.

JULY 5. -MARCHED FROM UNION BRIDGE TO FREDERICK. OBTAINED FORAGE, AND ENCAMPED NEAR THE CITY.

JULY 6. -MARCHED FROM FREDERICK TO WILLIAMSPORT, WHICH WE REACHED ABOUT 5 P. M., AND SKIRMISHED WITH THE ENEMY UNTIL DARK. ENEMY'S SKIRMISHERS ADVANCED ON LIEUTENANT RODER'S SECTION WHICH HAD BEEN DETACHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHELLING THE ENEMY'S SHARPSHOOTERS, WHO HAD POSSESSION OF THE BUILDINGS NEAR OUR POSITION. THE ENEMY WAS REPULSED BY THE TIMELY USE OF CANISTER, WHICH ALSO RALLIED OUR LINE OF SKIRMISHERS, SO THAT WE WERE ENABLED TO HOLD OUR POSITION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. AT DUSK, WE FELL BACK TO JONES'CROSS-ROADS, AND BIVOUACKED FOR THE NIGHT.

JULY 7. -MARCHED TO BOONSBOROUGH, AND TOOK UP A POSITION JUST OUT-
