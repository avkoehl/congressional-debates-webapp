A deserter who has just come in reports Field's division and three regiments of Wise's old brigade at and near New Market. Wise's men hold their extreme right, then Bratton, Gregg, Benning, Law, and Anderson. Wilcox's division, of Hill's corps, is lying back of them, between Field's division and Chaffin's farm. Kershaw left New Market with his division on Monday night and went then to Petersburg. The deserter does not know of his moving from there. I have just returned from a sick leave and am again attending to my duties here, and will keep you constantly informed of all reports and movements.

Respectfully,
