Corps were sent to this army. They were followed by troops from Ohio and Indiana, one-years" volunteers, numbering some 15,000. The fall of Richmond and the surrender of the different armies of the rebellion having followed the united efforts of our commanding general, the anxiety for the success of our armies soon abated, and soon the mustering out of the troops comprising the army commenced. Every effort has been put forth since that time to curtail the expenses, and on the 30th of June, 1865, the Army of the Shenandoah numbered only 15,000 men, for the most part made up of infantry from the Western States, five regiments of cavalry, and five batteries of artillery.

I have been closely identified with this army since July, 1864, and it affords me great pleasure to say that I know of no officer of the Quartermaster's Department in this army but that has rendered me every assistance in the discharge of my duties.

Having discharged my duties to the satisfaction of the commanding general (as will be seen by General Sherman's [Sheridan's] letter), I sincerely trust that the same will meet with the approval of the department.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

HENRY PAGE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Quartermaster, U. S. Volunteers.
