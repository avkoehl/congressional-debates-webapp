to which you refer, yourself, First Lieutenants Duffield and Wright and Second Lieutenant Dickinson and the enlisted men of six companies of the Michigan Ninth are declared exchanged, and os far all doubt is removed. By the recent exchange arranged at Aiken's Landing November 11 the following named officers of the Ninth Michigan are exchanged, viz: Capts. W. Wilkinson, Company A; Oliver C. rounds, Company B; Charles V. De Land, Company C; First Lieutenants Samuel A. Wiggins, Company H; Thomas J. Conely, Company K; W. A. Hull, Company G; J. C. Purdy, Company C; E. Marble, Company F; and Second Lieutenants A. M. Dobbelaere, Company A; N. r. Jersey, Company B, and W. r. Sellon, Company G. These I believe cover all the members of the Ninth Michigan who were on parole, but if there are any still not exchanged I will be glad if you will let me know, as it is probably owing to some confusion in the rolls.

An order will be published to-morrow or next day announcing all the recent exchanges according to the place of capture, and it is intended to cover all our paroled troops up to the 11th November, exclusive of a part of those taken at Harper's Ferry. The exchanges are fully perfected and the announcement in the order relieves every officer and soldier from the responsibilities of his parole. the order comes from the War Department through the Adjutant-General's Office and coffers all classes. Individual certificates are not given. In the meantime the announcement which I make to you of the several exchanges above named is made by authority of the War Department and restores the several officers to duty. Your regiment now in the field, it is proper that the officers exchanged should be with it, and I am directed by the General-in-Chief to say that yourself and those of the officers above named who are absent will immediately join.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

P. S. -Please inform Governor Blair of the contents of this letter.
