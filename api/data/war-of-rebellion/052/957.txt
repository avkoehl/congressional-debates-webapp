Please telegraph General Burnside that this telegram has been received and that I will push forward the railroad with all dispatch. I expect to reach Cincinnati Saturday.

HEADQUARTERS,Louisville, September 30, 1863.

Captain ANDERSON:

General Burnside telegraphs that Major Simpson is to take charge of whole railroad matters. I will furnish troops at his request to execute any order he may make.

It is important that Major Simpson should see me and get orders heretofore issued and have arrangements made. Can he come down? If necessary I can come up.

BULL'S GAP, September 30, 1863.

(Received October 1.)

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I arrived here at 5 p.m. with my brigade, except Second Ohio Cavalry, which I left at Greeneville. There is no enemy of any size near us, except a small force in possession of Rogersville.

All quiet at Greenville to 11 a.m. to-day. I will send a party to Rogersville to-morrow, to hold the place and watch the movements of any force that might endeavor to reach the Cumberland Gap road. I would have communicated with you sooner, but the line was not in working order. The One hundred and third Ohio are here. The Eight Tennessee Infantry and new regiments are at Lick Creek Bridge.

JAS. P. T. CARTER,

Colonel, Commanding.

MORRISTOWN, September 30, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

At 1 o'clock this p.m. Colonel Carter was at Bull's Gap, having halted there, whether with intention of making a stand or rest, my informant did not know. Just received dispatch from Lieutenant Ronder, commanding patrol, stating that 400 rebels, armed and mounted, were approaching Tazewell. Were mete by home guards, who were skirmishing and holding them in check.

HOSKINS,

Colonel.
