FORT BRADY, VA., December 2, 1864.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: Have the honor to report that the enemy opened on us suddenly and rapidly about 11 a. m. from their heavy batteries. No provocation was given on our part. We had the last shot. Their pickets opened at the same time, but one mortar shell seemed to quiet them. We suffered no damage, excepting one man slightly hurt by a columbiad shell bursting on the parapet near Numbers 11 100-pounder, knocking out the revetment he was standing near, on detachment. He was considerably jarred.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.

The Sixth Corps will probably begin to arrive here to-night or in the morning. As soon as it does get here, I want you to move with the Second and about two divisions of the Fifth Corps down the Weldon road, destroying it as far to the south as possible. Four guns to each division, I think, will be of the greatest abundance to take, and six days' rations.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I would suggest the relieving the whole of the Fifth Corps by the Sixth on its arrival; then sending the Fifth Corps with one or two divisions of the Second on the expedition proposed. I should myself think one division would be sufficient with the cavalry, as this would
