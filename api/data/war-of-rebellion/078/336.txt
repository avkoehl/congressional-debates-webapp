the Jamestown road intersects the Nashville turnpike to Knoxville. On Monday last they passed through Wartburg, thence through to Montgomery County in direction of Nashville.

Admiral D. G. FARRAGUT,

Commanding WEST Gulf Blockading Squadron, Mobile Bay, Ala.:

ADMIRAL: I think that Kirby Smith has abandoned the idea of attempting to cross the Mississippi, and is turning his whole force against the line of Arkansas. I am sending re-enforcements to Steele, and if the demonstration be in earnest, he will require all the force I can send him. This obliges me to withdraw a part of the force from Mobile Bay, leaving only what is necessary to secure the forts.

I believe that this will be only temporary and that within the next thirty days I shall be able to turn against Mobile an army of 25,000 to 30,000 men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
