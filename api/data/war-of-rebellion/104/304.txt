HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Near Spanish Fort, Ala., April 9, 1865.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR:

I am sorry our men are contending for so small a matter as the possession of guns which the enemy has abandoned. General Canby ordered one of my brigades to take possession of all property in Fort Alexis and Spanish Fort. Perhaps your men are not aware of the order.

G. GRANGER,Major-General.

Major-General STEELE:

The major-general commanding directs that General Garrard be instructed to place the four 30-pounder Parrott guns, now coming up, in the battery on his extreme left. I fear the 20-pounders have got on the wrong road.

JNO. M. WILSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN:

There are signals of evacuation of Blakely. Two boat loads of troops have gone toward Mobile. The rebels are keeping up a lively firing along their lines now. Tugs and row-boats were observed by the signal officer plying between Batteries Huger and Tracy in the night. I am going to take observations on the lines. I heard a rumor a few moments ago that Spanish Fort was taken.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
