General WILLCOX:

Your order directing me to reoccupy Jonesboroguh is received. The wagons are out in the country for forage and rations. My command is entirely out of rations. My commissary will be up on the rain with rations to-day. It will be very great inconvenience to move the command before the arrival of trains and rations, and unless you think there is urgent necessity for the immediate move I will defer it until morning. Will you please let the train that has my supplies come up to this point.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

[31.] Brigadier-General.
