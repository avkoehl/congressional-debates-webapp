THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 20,
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. No; but
they had been contracted.
Mr. EDWARDS. I do state that I think lie
would, under the circumstances, and under the
legislation of Congress, have been justified in
doing so.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. I may be
allowed to stiy,l hope, that I think the Secretary
of the Treasury observed the public faith in pay-
ing that debt in gold.
Mr. EDWARDS. I mean to say, with all def-
erence to the gentleman from Massachusetts, that
I have no doubt the Secretary of the Treasury
acted in the matter with that high sense of honor
and integrity for which he has a reputation all
over the country; but I mean to say,at the same
time, that, on the face of it, the transaction looks
to me like a great mistake.
Three of these bills, Mr. Chairman, provide
for issuing $300,000,000 of notes on interest; and
one of them provides for issuing the whole
$900,000,000 on interest—it may be in bauds or
notes. Now, sir, on the same principle that I
would avoid the pay men t of gold, on that same pi in-
ciple I would confine the operations of the Gov-
ernment in raising funds to its true basis—credit;
becausc by every dollar paid out in interest, and
by every dollar paid in gold, you increase to that
exteTit the indebtedness of the country; and you
thereby impair its ability to pay in the future. If
the Government can snve by making a currency
that will pass among the people without interest,
and answer their uses, I think it is better to do so,
than to roll up interest unnecessarily. I am in
favor of interest-bearing bonds where they have
twenty ^ears to run; but I do not want to see an
issue of interest-bearing Treasury notes, payable
in three years, the redemption of which might
come upon us before the war is over. I hold rather
to the issue of demand notes, to an extent to meet
the wants of the Government. Further than
this 
The CHAIRMAN. The hour to which the
debate was limited has arrived.
MESSAGE niOM THE SENATE.
The committee rose informally; and a message
from the Senate, through Mr. FIickey, its Chief
Clerk, informed the House that the Senate had
.passed a bill (No. 456) to enable the President to
negotiate a treaty with the Klamath and Modoc
Indians, and for other purposes; and a bill (No.
437) to amend an act entitled " An act to amend the
act of 3d ol March, 1837, entitled i An act supple-
mentary to the actentitled u An act to amend the
judicial system of the United States;" ' " in which
he was dnected to ask the concurrence of the
House.
WAYS AND MEANS—AGAIN.
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I propose to
modify my amendment by adding at the end of it
the following:
That all banks associations, colorations, and individ-
uals issuing ot receiving note* oi bills tor circulation as
currency alter Aptil 1, )d6<J, ui sums jcju eventing «iny tiac-
tional part ol a dollar, shall he Mibject to, and pay, a duty
ot five per cent, each hall year theieauoi, upon the amount
of such notes or Inii^ s-o issued.
Jlnd be it further enacted, That, in oubn to prevent and
punish counterfeiting and (Mudi'ib'til alterations of the
boudi, note-;, and fmetional cuiieiicj authouzod to be is-
sued by flu* ae:, :if! the |>mv Nion« oi' the sixth and seventh
s-ections of the uct entitled - An act to authorize the issue
ot United States note**, and foi the redemption or funding
thereof, and for funding ihe (loaiinj; debt of Hie United
States, appioved Frbrusuy «>, 186),"' shall, m> tar a.- apph
cable, apply to the bonds not"s and tiactiona! cunency '
hereby authorized to be i*Mied, in hke ni.mnei as it the j
paid sixth and seventh sections werehcieb) adopted a-- j
additional sections of this act. And the sum of yftOO.OOO k i
hereby appropuated uut ol any moms m tue TreabUi} not '
oiheiwise appropriated, to enable the Secietaiy of the I
lieasury to carrj tin* art into effect j
I propose to avail myself of my privilege, and j
occupy pei haps not my full hour, but half of that i
time, in comparing the two propositions before !
the committee. I shall have great difficulty in j
attracting the attention of the committee, as I shall ]
deal in no figures of rhetoric or flights of fancy >
or theoretical disquisitions, but in dry matters o"f *
fact and figures of arithmetic.
I differ, with great reluctance, from a majority
of the Committee of Ways and Means. But as I
sincerely believe that the system proposed by this
bill, and continued as it must be if this be adopted
to the end of the war, will involve the nation in
great trouble, I feel it my duty to state my objec-
. tions to it, and propose a remedy. I shall make no
j factious opposition to the bill, and if the House
1 do not agree with me, I shall consider that I am
j in error, and support this or any other measure
; which promises immediate relief to our suffering
| country.
i Our present ascertained indebtedness stands
j about as follows:
I Old debt falling due within a few years from this time, at
; different periods, about  $70,000,000
Loan under acts or tins Congress  QoO.OOO^OOO
! Certificates of indebtedness, about  100.000.000
! Loans on ten days deposit, about  100,000,000
| I suppose the unliquidated debts due the
i Auny, eontraetois, and others, cannot be
less than, (besides postal cunency)  200,000,000
§720,000,000
The bill of the committee proposes
; to increase it, as follows:
| It leaves the am homy, already existing by
; the act of last session, to issue five-twenty
I bonds to the amount of  500,000,000
And by this bill  900,000,000
Making, when all are issued, our debt..$2 120.000.000
This is independent of the Texas indemnity, the |
Oregon war debt, and old Treasury notes—about :
$10,000,000—besides Pacific railroad bonds, not
less than $100,000,000; whatever we give to New !
York and Illinois to enlaige their canals; and bonds :
for emancipation, all, by presumption, payable in \
coin. i
Three hundred millions of the §900,000,000 |
provided by this bill may be in legal tender notes; \
$300,000,000 in inierest-beanng United States 1
notes payable in three yeais, and being semi-
legal fender, that is, a legal under to the United i
States for everything but duties on nnpoits. '
This §900,000,000 is to beai six pe rcent, inter- |
est, payable half'yearly in com, but the principal :
is redeemable, when due, in legal tender, or any I
other lawful money of the United States. The. j
whole of the twenty years bonds will fall due j
nearly at the same time, to wit, twenty years from !
date. So that all must mature within twenty or |
twenty-two years fiom this time; for to be of any
use they must ali be negotiated within the next ■
fiscal year. So,a!so5\viilM he <>250,000,000already !
issued, and the $500,000,000 authoi i^ed by former I
laws. So that it will be seen that our whole in-
debtedness will have to be paid within the com- 1
pass of two yenrs about twenty years hence. To !
promise to pay §2,120,000,000 in so crowded a 1
time, seems to me to make a promise to be broken, !
unless we then continue the legal tender issues to
that vast amount to accomplish it.
I will now state the provisions of the substi-
tute^ It proposes to issue $900,000,000 in bonds
beaiing inteiest at the rate of six percent, per
annum, payable half yearly, m lawful money,
; and redeeming the principal when duo, in coin. <
j They are to fall due as follows: $50,000,000 in !
j ten yeais from the l^f day of July next, (the '
! beginning of the fiscal yeai;) £50,000,000 in!
, eleven years, and so §50,000,000 every succeed- i
1 ing 1st of July until all are exhausted. It pro- \
\ poses to issue $300,000,000 of legal tender notes j
| for the immediate payment of the Army, and other
| pressing debts of the Government. It repeals the
I right to issue the $500,000,000 of five-twenty
I bonds. It continues the payment of coin for the
; interest of bonds already issued under the laws,
j but no further. It repeals the law authorizing the !
i deposit ot legal tender notes bearing interest of!
live per cent., one half to be retained without use '
and payable on ten days'demand. In short, it ]
makes all our interest payable m just such money I
as other people pay theirs in, except where our j
faith is already pledged to pay in gold. That 11
amount is §250,000,000, and $25,000,000 of the |!
$500,000,000 loan, most of it at 7.30per cent, in- |j
terest, payable in gold, which, at the present price ;1
of gold, makes u 10.22 per cent, inteiest. The j|
amount ot gold to be purchased for that will be I,
$18,450,000. The premium on thatsum at forty ■■
per cent, would be $7,380,000, making the interest i,
cost the Government $25,830,000. One of the ji
most striking differences between the two bills, it i:
will be seen, is the payment of the interest in
gold and the principal in currency by the one,
and payment of the interest in lawful money
and the principal in coin by the other.
_ Now, I ask gentlemen to inform me what jus-
tice there is in compelling the people to receive
their interest in a currency of forty per cent, less
value than is paid to the banks and capitalists who
| invest in Government bonds? It seems to me to
! be rank injustice. Now, when so small apart of
. the debt bcai s interest, if gold brings forty pei ceut.
, premium, what will it b.mg when the debt is ten
, times its present amount, as it will be when the
bonds authorized by this bill and existing laws
arc sold? I have no doubt it will be held at sixty
per cent, above par. But suppose it to be no more
than forty per cent. Thejnterest on $2,120,000,000
| ($150,000,000 at seven and three tenths percent.,
j and the balance at six per cent.,) would amount
j to $129,150,000. The premium on this would
j be $51,6GO,000, making the whole interest cost
| the Government $180,810,000 per annum. That
I amount will commence in loss than two years from
: this date. I ask how are we to meet this annual in-
( terest without adding to the tax already so burden-
! some to the people? It may^ be answered that
; the amount receivable from internal duties and
j duties on imports will do it. I wish itmightbeso,
j but doubt it. I suppose the highest amount we
! can safely count on from internal revenue will be
• $150,000,000, and not more, on an average, than
i $50,000,000 ftom customs, making $200,000,000.
i The oidinary expenses of Government will, I
j think, in these times, reach fully $80,000,000.
' Then wo must pay m coin, i suppose, not less
than $5,000,000 for foreign pui poses. Then wo
i have $70,000,000 of the old debt to pay in coin
; within some fifteen years. 1 do not know how it
; is distributed. That, with its premium, will reach
| $6,000,000 per annum on an avtrasv; which three
I sums, with the premium on the fc5,"000,000, (mak-
i ing it $7,000,000,) would amount to $93*000,000.
; Tins, deducted from $200,000,000 lewnue, would
| leave but $107,000,000 to pay §180,810,000 mter-
' est, leaving a deficit of $73,810,000 unprovided for,
: Mr. Chairman, this will produce repudiation,
i The people cannot bear that further taxation.
! But it may be said that a part of the coin will
; be furnished by the customs, and thus lessen the
| amount of premium. That amount, I fear, will
j be but comparatively trifling. If our foreign de-
j mand, and the principal of our old debt, take
; $13,000,000 a year on an aveiage, it will leave
i but $37,000,000 to pay on the interest. Deduct
the premium on this, being $14,800,000, from
the deficit of $73,810,000, and it would still leave
$59,010,000 unprovided for. This is to accumu-
late for twenty years, and would then amount to
$J ,180,200,000, to be added to the principal debt;
font must either accumulate or be borrowed,which
would be the same thing. This would make our
debt, at the end of twenty years, $3,300,200,000,
all to be paid at once. This system can have but
one result, bankruptcy. At the rate of interest
which it would bear, even if then paid in cur-
rency, it would make our debt two and a half
times as large as the national debt of England,
for our average interest, counting the premium
on gold, is above nine per cent, per annum.
Let us now see what would be the working of
the substitute. The debt would be $200,000,000
less than by the bill of the committee, as it takes
away the $500,000,000 of five-twenty bonds,
but adds $300,000,000 of legal tender to the
$900,000,000 of bonds.
The whole debtbv the same data would be, $2,130,000,000
Less  200,000,000
$ 1,90a,000.000
bearing six per cent, interest, being $115,200,000.
Take our income, as before, at  §300,000,000
Oidsnary expenses $SO,OUO.OOO
Fotei«n expense*  7,000,000
Payment of'old debt  0,000,000
  93,000,000
Would leave  $107,000,000
to pay an interest of $315,200,000, leaving a deficit
of $8,200,000 to be supplied, against $59,010,000
in the bill, being a dilfciwice to the amount of
$50,810,000 annually against, tliM committee's
bill. This differ ence in twenty years would be
$1,016,200,000 in favor of the substitute.
Another great advantage which I think the sub-
stitute has over the bill, is in the time of payment.
No one, I suppose, believes that any of the three
year bonds will be paid when due. One hundred
and fifty millions of the seven and three tenths
bonds fall due in two years, and I hope will be
paid only in twenty year bonds or legal tender,
and never renewed at,seven-thirty. The three year
bonds of this bill, and the five-twenties sold,must
be renewed in long bonds. Thus the whole debt
