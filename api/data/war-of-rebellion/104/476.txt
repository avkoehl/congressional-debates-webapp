of Tennessee, will be treated as a public enemy and an outlaw and killed like a mad dog by any one who meets him. See that your command does not interfere in any way, either in their persons or their property, with the peaceably disposed, and with those who stay at home and mind their own business. In case the railroad is not in running order to the Holston River you will make your depot camp at or near the Rogersville Junction, from which point you will draw your supplies. You will give all the aid and assistance in your power to all civil officers in the execution of their functions, and urge upon the people the necessity of re-establishing civil authority and the supremacy of State laws as soon as possible, and before the U. S. forces are disbanded or withdrawn from this section of the country. Make me, either by courier or telegraph, a daily report of your operations.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., April 26, 1865.

(Received 11.45 a.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

A force of 1,000 to 1,500 who are near Mount Sterling propose terms of surrender. From my weakness they are arrogant; others are excited. I hope orders taking troops from this department will be suspended.

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, KY., April 26, 1865.

Major-General PALMER,

Louisville, Ky.:

There are 1,000 or 1,500 rebels here with "flag of truce" and want honorable terms of surrender.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, April 26, 1865.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

Order all posts to be on the alert. Tender them this proposition: "A surrender of men to be paroled, all public property including horses and arms of soldiers to be given up." Inform me at once of answer.

P[ALMER].

LEXINGTON, KY., April 26, 1865.

Major-General PALMER,

Louisville, Ky.:

I think they will accept your proposition and terms. Would it be required to have duplicate rolls of all men and officers? Will officers be permitted to retain side-arms? If necessary, I will send an officer to consummate the arrangements, if they accept.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
