she has been brought over the Bulkhead with less difficulty than any of my transport vessels.

I feel confident that this step will meet with your approval, when you are fully informed as to the emergencies of the case. As soon as I can make a permanent landing of a portion of my forces I shall return the Spaulding to Fort Monroe.

Fort the same reasons as in the above case I have also detained the propeller Virginia, being confident that the necessities of the case and the good of the public service warranted me in so doing. She will be returned to Old Point as soon as I can possibly dispense with the services.

The weather for the last two or three days has been such as to retard our progress very considerably. The winds have been so fresh and the sea so rough that it has been with the greatest difficulty that we could, even with the assistance of the tugs, pas from one vessel to another; we have, however, been constantly at work, and the preparations for an advance ar enow rapidly drawing to a close. The vessels that have suffered from collisions and other causes we are endeavoring to repair, and with one or two exceptions have succeeded in rendering them again serviceable. Having understood that a force of some 5,000 of the enemy were at Nag's Head, opposite Roanoke Island, orders were issued by Commodore Goldsborough for the Chippewa, now of the blockading force off Wilmington, to proceed at once to Nag's Head for active service. These orders were forwarded by the Eastern State on Saturday, the 1st of February, and the return of the vessel is now hourly expected.

The storm has considerably abated, and we are now in hopes to be under way by to-morrow or at farthest the day after. Our vessels are nearly ready, and nothing but violent weather will now prevent our getting off.

I am, General, your very obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Brigadier-General.
