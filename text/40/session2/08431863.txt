which was ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. CAMERON. I also present a number
of petitions from the Philadelphia Typograph-
ical Union, signed very largely by journeymen
printers. These gentlemen represent that an
international copyright would do great injury
to their trade. It is proper to say to the Sen-
ate that no class of workmen in the world are
so intelligent as journeymen printers, none so
well acquainted with their own interests and
the interests of the country in which they live.
I think, therefore, these petitioners are enti-
tled to peculiar attention, and for that reason
I make these remarks, trusting that the joint
Committee on the Library will give these peti-
tions full weight.. I move their reference to
that committee.
The motion was agreed to.

Navy may be reduced to thirty vessels, the
Army-to twenty thousand men, the Navyappro-
priations to $12,000,000, and the Army appro-
priations to $35,000,000, and that the revenue
laws may be so adjusted as to keep the balance
of trade in our favor, so that the products of
gold and silver may remain at home, thus
hastening the time when we shall have a specie
basis for our currency. I move their reference
to the Committee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.

HEIUS OF ASBURY DICKINS.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move that the Senate
postpone all other business and proceed to the
consideration of Senate bill No. 408, a private
bill, which I trust will not take much time.
The motion was agreed to ; and the bill (S.
No. 408) for the benefit of the heirs of Asbury
Dickins, deceased, was read the second time
and considered as in Committee of the Whole.
It provides for the payment to Maria Dick-
ins and the other heirs of Asbury Dickins, de-
ceased, of $4,276 81, it being the difference
between the salaries of the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Secretary of Stats and chief
clerk of those Departments for the aggregate
periods of time that Asbury Dickins acted as
Secretaries aforesaid under pro tempore ap-
pointments by the President of the United
States.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I am very
reluctant to oppose this bill; but having voted
against it in committee I will state briefly the
reasons why I did so.
I know that a bill for the relief cf any offi-
cer of the Senate, or one who has been jori-
neeted with the Senate in an official capacity,
always meets with so much favor that very
little scrutiny is given to it in any case. The
facts in this case are that an officer who was
for a very long period of his life in the ser-
vice of the country, and always receiving a
salary commensurate with his capacity and
with his service, did, for some temporary period
of time, discharge the duties of a higher office;
and now it is proposed to pay him the differ-
ence between his salary as chief clerk and tho
salary of Secretary of State and Secretary of
the Treasury, which positions he held at vari-
ous timesâ€”an amount which he never claimed
during his lifetime, to my knowledge, and
which comes up here a long period after his
death. It strikes me that if we pass this bill
we set an example for paying the Assistant
Secretary of State for acting as Secretary dur-
ing the time that the Secretary may be ill;
and we set an example for paying the various
officers who may have discharged the duty of
Secretary of the Treasury for such time as the
Secretary of the Treasury may have been ab-
sent ; and so of any other Cabinet officer.
Mr. HARLAN. I know but little about the
merits of this bill, but I understand that it is
to make some payment to tho heirs of Mr.
Dickins, at one time Secretary of the Senate.
I rise merely to state one fact for the informa-
tion of the Senate, that I know personally that
one of these heirs was in the rebel army. It
came to my knowledge in this way: he had
been strongly recommended for a position in
the Interior Department, and when presented
with the oath required by law to be taken by
all officers of the United States he was unable
to take it for the reason, as assigned by him-
self, that he had performed service in the rebel
army.
Mr. FESSENDEN. That difficulty can be
obviated by adding a proviso, which I suppose
the Senator from Illinois can draw at once;
but I wish to inform my friend from Vermont
that there are as many as twenty precedents
of a like kind on the statute-book, not only
precedents where officers have received the
difference between the two salaries, but have
received both salaries at the same time in some
cases; and precedents, also, where one Cab-
inet officer discharging temporarily the duties
of another Cabinet officer has received both
salaries by act of Congress. I hold a list of
themin myhand, which the Senator can look at.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. But the Sen-
ator will not claim that that is right, whatever
may be the facts.
Mr. FESSENDEN. It was done by Con-
gress; but sincc that time a law has been
passed that no officer shall receive the pay of
both offices for such service. This bill goes no
further than to provide that payment shall be
made of the difference between Mr. Dickins's
salary as chief clerk and the salary of the head
of the Department during the time he dis-
charged the duties of head of the Department.
I understandâ€”I do not know how the fact is;
my friend from Illinois can sayâ€”that this mat-
ter was once before the Court of Claims, and
the Court of Claims allowed the claim. I
suppose that was at the time when all their
awards were by law sent back to Congress to
be acted upon, and the report probably was
laid aside and not acted upon. The Court of
Claims have, as I understand, decided it to be
a just and valid claim, as I have no doubt that
it is. The fact that Mr. Dickins did not urge
the claim while he was alive was not because
he did not consider it his due, but because he
was all the time in service as Secretary of the
Senate, and he did not choose to bring it for-
