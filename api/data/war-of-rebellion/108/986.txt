Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CAMP FIRST ENGINEER REGIMENT,

Garnett's Farm, June 4, 1864--12 m.

Lieutenant Colonel C. S. VENABLE,

Aide-de-camp to General R. E. Lee:

COLONEL: Your dispatch of this morning is received. We have repaired the causeway at McClellan's Bridge (the second Federal bridge below New Bridge), and will lay the pontoon there at once. I have a large force at work on the causeway at the bridge on Golding's farm, and will continue the work. By using the material of the old causeway that remains, and such parts of it as are still standing, I hope to make a crossing for wagons by to-morrow. The material is not as sound as I would like, but it will be better to risk it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. M. R. TALCOTT,

Colonel.

P. S.--I inclose a sketch* designating the bridges.
