GLASGOW, September 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

There are no soldiers east of Macon, except the few militia I am keeping quartered until the arms can come you have ordered here. I wish you would insure their being sent. The state of things in this country is bad. Loyal men are in fear, and leaving. An order which should require all men to take up arms, leave the country, or by shot, would meet with a ready response. I think our prominent disloyal men here would welcome it.

J. T. K. HAYWARD,

Colonel.

Ike Powell, with forty men of Shelby's command, is in the lower part of this county recruiting. His recruiting stations are in my possession. It is reported on good authority that several parties of the same command have recently recrossed the river. Have ordered Captain Durham to Allen.
