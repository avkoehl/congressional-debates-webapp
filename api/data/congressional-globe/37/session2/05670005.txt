The amounts paid to the different lines of trans-
atlantic steamships employed by this Department,
for service performed during the year, under the
provisions of the existing law, which limits the
compensation to the sea and inland postages on
the mails transported, if the conveyance is by an
American steamer, and to sea postage only, if by
a foreign steamer, will appear by the table (No.
4) annexed to this report. The total cost of
this service was §392,887 63. Of this amount,
$157,174 09 was earned by American steamers,
pei forming twenty-three round trips, at the sea
and United States inland postages, and §235,713 54
by foreign steamers, performing eighty-six round
trips, at the sea postage only.
The aggregate amount of postages on the mails
exchanged between the United States and the Brit-
ish North American provinces, during the year,
was $186,900 50; of which §96,304 07 was col-
lected in this country, and §90,596 43 in the Brit-
ish provinces.
The United States postages on the West India
mails was §59,544 48; all of which has been paid
to the different lines of American steamships con-
veying the mails to and from Havana, Matanzas,
and St. Thomas, respectively.
The United States postages on mails forwarded
to, and received from, Vera Cruz, Mexico,
amounted to §4,370 08, which has been, in like
manner, paid to the steamers and sailing vessels
performing the sea transportation between New
Orleans and Vera Cruz.
The United States postages on the correspond-
ence forwarded to and received from Central and
South America, and Acapulco, (Mexico,) by the
California line of steamers, via Panama, during
the year, amounted to §12,100 35. The entire
California mail service was transferred from the
Isthmus to the overland route on the 1st of July
last; but the Isthmus, Central and South Ameri-
can mails are still conveyed by the California line
of steamers, under the existing:law, which limits
the compensation to the United States postages
on the mails transported, Cornelius Vandcrbilt,
Esq., the proprietor of the line, having consented
" to carry them for the postages until Congress
meets and has the opportunity of making some
more pcrmanentprovision." It is claimed by him
that the postages on these mails fall far short of
a fair and proper remuneration for the service per-
formed in their transportation. In view of the
impoitance of keeping up a direct mail communi-
cation with the Isthmus of Panama, and the coun-
tries on the Pacific coast of Central and South
America, I respectfully recommend the subject to
the early consideration of Congress.
Additional articles to the United States and
French postal convention of the 2d March, 1857,
have been mutually agreed upon, establishing new
exchanging offices, on the side of the United States
at Portland, Detroit, and Chicago, respectively;
and on the side of France at Paris; and provid-
ing for an exchange of mails by the Canadian
mail packets plying between Liverpool and Port-
land, or between Liverpool and River du Loup;
a copy of these articles accompanies this report,
(No. 5.) Additional articles to the postal con-
vention with Prussia, of the same character, have
also been agreed upon with the general post office
at Berlin, establishing, on the part of the United
States, new offices of exchange at Portland, De-
troit, and Chicago, respectively; to exchange
closed mails with Aachen, (Aix-la-Chapcllc,)
through England, by means of the Canadian line
of mail packets, a copy of which is annexed to
this report, (No. 6.) These arrangements have
greatly expedited the transmission of European
correspondence to and from the western States,
and give entire satisfaction to that portion of the
country.
I have had the satisfaction of arranging the
terms of a postal convention with Mexico, which
was concludcd with the Mexican minister on the
31st of July last, subject to ratification within six
months from that date by the President of the
United States, by and with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate, and by the President of the
republic of Mexico, with the approval of the
Mexican congress. This convention was ap-
proved by the Senate of the United States on the
6th of August last; but no official information
has yet been received of the action of Mexico
thereupon. Its principal provisions are:
1. The establishment of direct mail steamship
service between New York and Vera Cruz, cither
direct or via Havana, the expense of which is to
be borne equally by the respective post depart-
ments of the two countries.
2. A uniform rate of postage between the two
countries of twenty-live cents for a single letter
under half an ounce in weight, and an additional
charge of twenty-five cents for each additional
fraction of half an ounce; prepayment of which
is obligatory, and each country to retain all the
postage it collects, which dispenses entirely with
any postage accounts between the two countries.
3. With respect to printed matter of every kind,
each country is to levy and collect its own post-
age only at the established domestic rates; and the
dispatching country is to charge and collect, in
addition to its regular domestic inland rate, a sea
rate of one cent on each newspaper, and one cent
per ounce on pamphlets and other kinds of printed
matter.
4. Each country grants to the other the terri-
torial transit of closed mail bags through its ter-
ritories, free from all duties, tax, detention, or
examination; the means of transportingsuch bags
to be furnished, and the cost thereof to be paid,
by the country to which they may respectively
belong; and the carnages, cattle, and men exclu-
sively employed in the service, to be free from
arrest, charges, or molestation of any kind what-
ever, except for some flagrant violation of the laws
of the country through which the closed bags are
conveyed.
If this convention should bo ratified by Mexico,
special legislation will be necessary to provide for
the portion of the expenses to be paid by this De-
partment, in maintaining ;i regular line of mail
packets between New York and Vera Cruz; as
the provisions of the existing laws limit the com-
pensation for sea service to the postages, which
will be wholly inadequate to sustain such a line
of packets.
A special appropriation from the Treasury will
be required, to enable the Postmaster General to
carry this convention into operation. It is not
only important as a postal arrangement, in view
of the present interruption of mail communication
via New Orleans, hut it is also regarded as a meas-
ure of groat political and commercial importance
to the respective countries.
Propositions have been submitted for postal ar-
rangements with the Governments of Costa liica
and Guatemala, respectively, which arc now un-
der consideration; and the Department has other
arrangements in contemplation for improvements
in our postal intercourse with foreign countries,
by the reduction of rates of postage, and increased
certainty and efficiency in the transportation of
the mails.
The negotiations with the British office for a
reduction of postage, which have been pending
since 1857, were unsuccessful, chiefly, as I under-
stand it, because of the difference of the offices as
to whether the steameis employed should receive
a greater or less proportion of the postage remain-
ing, after deducting the United States inland rate
of three cents. This point did not seem to me to
be of sufficient significance to be allowed to defeat
a measure of so much importance to the commerce
of both countries as the reduction of 50 per cent,
of the rate of postage. Although fully concurring
with my predecessors that the basis proposed by
this Department was the more just as it recog-
nized and was foundfd upon the inland rates es-
tablished by the laws of the two countries, 1 have,
on a review of the whole subject, concluded to
accept the division of rates as proposed, which
grants to the United Kingdom the same rate of
inland postage, rather than longer delay an ar-
rangement so desirable as that sought to be attained
by the proposed reduction of the international let-
ter postage from 24 to 12 cents the single rate. I
have, therefore, formally accepted the basis for
international letters as originally proposed by the
British office on the 33th of February, 1857, that
the benefit of the reduction may accrue to the
written conespondencc between the two coun-
tries as early as practicable. The other propo-
sitions relating to printed matter and territorial
transit charges are held for further consideration
and arrangement as soon as the respective depart-
ments find it practicable to give them attention. I
trust that a review of these subjects, by the re-
spective postal administrations, may result in fur-
ther advantages to the people engaged in this
intercourse.
MEXICAN MAILS ON THE PACIFIC COAST,
I commend to the consideration of Congress the
propriety of an appropriation to sustain a reliable
