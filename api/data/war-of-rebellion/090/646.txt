RECTORTOWN, VA., October 29, 1864.

Early yesterday morning I sent a part of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry to near snicker's Gap to arrest one of Mosby's boarding-house keepers. They have returned with him and 15 of Mosby's men, 17 horses and equipments, and a number of revolvers. The track is taken up to within about a mile of this place. I shall not leave here for White Plains probably until to-morrow.
