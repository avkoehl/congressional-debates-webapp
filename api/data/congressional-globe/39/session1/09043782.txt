THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 13,
Â«aid, I think he must be convinced of one of
two things: either I have not stated the facts
correctly, or the contestant is 13 votes in. the
minority by the showing of his own paper.
Mr. SCOFIELD. If the gentletnan will al-
low me to interrupt liim, I desire to say that if
he will turn to the record in the case, for in-
stance, of the vote in McClellan hospital, he
will find on pages 6 and 7 the return properly
signed, giving the names of the voters. It is
true that-the certificate of the oaths is wanting
there; but this will be found fully given on
page 880.
Mr. DAWES. There are two returns from
McClellan hospital; one for Westmoreland
county, the other for Fayette or Indiana county.
Mr. SCOFIELD. The gentleman is think-
ing of the returns from Lincoln hospital.
Mr. DAWES. Well, Mr. Speaker, I prefer
to allow the contestant the benefit of those
3 votes, still leaving the sitting member with a
clear majority, rather than detain the House
by a minute examination of that matter.
This case, Mr. Speaker, has been examined
by the committee with a patience and assiduity
which, I venture to say, nave scarcely a paral-
lel in investigations of this character. The
committee waived in behalf of the contestant
every difficulty and objection which they possi-
bly could waive in order to reach the merits
of the case. The several gentlemen from Penn-
sylvania who have advocated the claims of the
contestant with so much zeal and ability have
directed their attention to various returns con-
nected with this case, but no one" of those gen-
tlemen has even looked at the contestant's own
brief. They all appear to have been ignorant
of its existence until I called their attention to
it here in the House. I have taken up that
brief and have, I think, shown conclusively
that the contestant on his own showing did
not receive a majority of all the votes of the
district.
There are other papers in this case to which
I might refer in confirmation of the position
which I have taken; but at this late hour I
will not tax my own strength or the patience
of the House by dwelling upon them. I re-
peat, that this case presents no question about
disfranchising soldiers. I affirm that it is im-
possible to make out a majority of votes for
the contestant unless you count votes which
were cast for other officers, or count the same
votes twice, or count votes which have no au-
thentication whatever. I leave this case to the
good judgment and good sense of each mem-
ber of the House.
Mr. PAINE. I am informed that the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Kelley] and
the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Shellabarger]
desire to speak on this question. If they do
I will yield the floor to them. If not I will
call for the previous question to-morrow after
the morning hour.
Mr. SHELLABARGER. I do not want to
say anything this afternoon, but if permitted I
may want to say a -word or two to-morrow.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, demanded
the previous question. .
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, moved to
reconsider the vote by which the main question
was ordered; and also moved that the motion
to reconsider be laid on the table.
The Salter motion was agreed to.
And then, on motion of Mr. PAINE, (at
five o'clock and five minutes p. m,,) the House
adjourned.
