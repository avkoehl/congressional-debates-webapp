OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE FOURTH DIVISION:

The general commanding tenders his thanks to each and all, officers and soldiers of this command, for their splendid courage exhibited on the 22nd and 28th instant. During this campaign you have won for yourselves, if you had been before unknown, a name and reputation which will live in the history of your country and command the admiration of generations yet unborn. We mourn the loss of many brave companions, but their memory will always be dear to us, and none will ever hesitate to pay to them the tribute due to dead heroes. Let us all look confidently to the future, remaining faithful to ourselves, and at no distant day we may hope to return to our families, with a government firmly established over every acre of rebel territory. Until then our mission will not be complete. Again I thank you for the most distinguished exhibition of courage that I have witnessed during three years of active service.

WILLIAM HARROW,Brigadier-General, commanding.
