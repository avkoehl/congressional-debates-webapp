transport this force with as little delay as possible. The whole force will number about 30,000 men, and there will also be from 20,000 to 25,000 animals. They will need to be supplied with forage and subsistence stores to take them from this point to New Orleans, and it is advisable that you send a sufficient supply by steamers here to carry them to New Orleans. They will embark here as rapidly as transportation can be furnished them.
