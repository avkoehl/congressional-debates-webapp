Major WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have ordered scouts to Memphis on all sides, with a view to ascertain certainly what troops are there, and desire to know of the major-general commanding whether an expedition against the place would meet his approbation. I could have a supply of forage and rations sent to Panola and Abbeville by rail and could leave both points one morning and attack it the next; if the forces is too heavy I can move above to Randolph with my command and batteries, and it would take 10,000 men to drive me off. A few hours' work would enable me to fight successfully all the so-called gun-boats they have, or I could move onto the MISSISSIPPI River at Commerce and obstruct the navigation of the river, having my flank well protected by Rucker's brigade in the direction of Memphis. It may be the means of preventing re-enforcements to the Trans- MISSISSIPPI Department, and I think it more than likely we can capture transports and supplies. Such a move may create diversions which will be of advantage. Anticipating a move into Middle Tennessee, I am satisfied the enemy have a force at Athens and Huntsville. I write for the purpose of knowing the wish of the major-general commanding or his views. If it should be thought best to go above Memphis on the river, I should leave Colonel Rucker, with 1,400 men, as at present, at Abbeville and Panola; if to Commerce, throw his force up to Coldwater and threaten Memphis; if to Memphis, would take everything with me, leaving my wagons, &amp;c., at Abbeville and Panola. If it should become necessary to move into Middle Tennessee, it would be better to move from here than from Corinth, as it would be much nearer and the enemy would have but little opportunity to know of it until we reached Tuscumbia.

I am, very respectfully,

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
