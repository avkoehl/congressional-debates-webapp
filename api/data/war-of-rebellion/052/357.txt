nished to General Rosecrans' army between the 2nd January, the date of the battle of Stone's River, and the 29th of August.

Since writing the dispatch, I find that the number of horses should have been 18, 957 instead of 18,857. The figures were made up as follows:

Furnished to troops at Louisville,, 5,741 horses, and to troops at Cincinnati, 1,517 horses, being to Lieutenant Dudley, quartermaster Stanley's Cavalry Division. At Indianapolis: 86 horses to Captain G. A. May, First Indiana Cavalry; 95 horses to Captain J. C. Tobias, First Indiana Cavalry; 286 horses to Lieutenant T. R. Dudley, Second Indiana Cavalry; 64 horses to Colonel E. M. McCook, Second Indiana Cavalry; 900 horses to Colonel T. J. Harrison, Thirty-ninth Indiana Volunteers; 60 horses to Captain J. B. Cox, Tenth Indiana Battery; 110 horses to Captain M. A. Osborne, Twentieth Indiana Battery. Total, 8,859.

Sent to Nashville: From Louisville, 9,562 horses and 10,193 mules; from Cincinnati, 2,181 mules; from Evansville, 438 horses and 163 mules. Total, 10,000 horses and 12,537 mules.

Purchased at Nashville 98 horses and 3,940 mules.

These figures may not be precisely correct, but they are as nearly so as I can ascertain. The animals furnished at and sent from Louisville include those sent there from Detroit, Chicago, Springfield, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati.

The statement does not embrace those purchased in Tennessee, except at Nashville. I understand that you have called for a report from Lieutenant-Colonel Hodges of all purchased in the Department of the Cumberland.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. SWORDS,

Assistant Quartermaster-General
