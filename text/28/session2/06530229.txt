Annexation of Texas—Mr. Merrick.
Senate.
ment, or adhere to your high rates, and throw the
business into the hands of individuals. I am most
anxious to preserve the department. It is, or may
be, if properly conducted, the most valuable institu-
tion of the government. Let it not be ruthlessly de-
stroyed by obstinate resistance to reform. We,
who urge reform, are the true conservatives—those
who resist it, the destructives.
What will the effect of the reduction? How many
letters will go by mail? What amount of postage,
will be collected? These are important questions
not admitting of precise and definite answers. We
have had one example—that of Great Britain—of
the effect of cheap postage. In 1840 she reduced
her rates of postage from an average of about 7
pence to 1 penny on each letter. The effect has
been to increase the number of letters sent by mail
to about three-fold the former number. Before the
reduction, the number was about 77,500,000. In
two years the posted letters increased to 204,000,000,
and now they have reached 222,000,000.
If Great Britain sends 204,000,000 of letters by
mail annually, the United States ought to send, by
the ratio of population, 130,000,000; by the ratio-of
their respective citizens able to read and write, 164,-
000,000; according to the commercial ratio, 81,000,-
000; according to the ratio of productions, 100,000,-
000; and according to the British rate of increase
from reduction of the rates of postage, 82,500,000.
The lowest number, at a 5-cent rate of postage,
would produce ample revenue to sustain the de-
partment and extend the accommodations. Will
not the conducting of a given amount of business in
this country require the writing of as many letters
as the like amount of business in England? It would
seem probable that it might more. In England the
population is compact, and the facilities for travel-
ing great; and therefore it may be reasonably ex-
pected that much of the business will be transacted
in person. Here, the population is scattered; trav-
eling comparatively cifficult, and much of the busi-
ness must be conducted by correspondence.
But it is said that the British experiment of low
postage has proved a failure. A failure? If so, it is
the most brilliant failure on record—far above ordi-
nary successes. But the revenue has diminished.
True: who did not expect it to diminish for a time?
A reduction of 86 per cent, in the rates of postage,
produced a reduction of only 36 per cent, in the
levenue. It is still ample for all of the wants of the
department, and pays a large balance into the treas-
ury. The net revenue in 1843, after the payment
oCall post office expenses, was <£643,727, over
$3,200,000, (Senate doument 43, page 2;) besides
transporting free all of the newspapers sent by
mail, which pay no postage, but are subject to a
stamp duty of one penny each as an equivalent.
This tax, which is only a more convenient mode of
collecting the postage, amounts to over a million of
dollars more. The number of letters sent by mail, and
the post office revenue, still continue to increase rap-
idly. The reduction of postage has had much
effect in extending business and increasing the reve-
nue of other departments. Great has been its influ-
ence in the diffusion of knowledge and in imparting
happiness to the people. It is universally approved;
and is regarded in England as the most valuable
concession to the popular will since the House of
Brunswick ascended the throne. And yet it is call-
ed a failure! May we have just such a failure!
If low rates of postage have increased the num-
ber of letters in England to threefold, what number
will be posted in this country? Between forty and
fifty millions of letters are now written annually in
the United States, which would,besent by mail if it
were not for the high rates of postage. The pay-
ing letters, in 1837, amounted to 29,360,000; and the
free letters and dead letters to about 3,000,000 more.
—(Postmaster General's report of 1837.) The
number of paying letters has since been reduced to
25,015,000.—(Senate Doc. 50, of 1844.) Popula-
tion, business, intelligence, and every element of
correspondence, have been making rapid advances;
and it is apparent that but little, if any, over half of
the letters which are written are now sent by mail.
The number of letters must be nearly or quite
50,000,000. Not a very large per centage of in-
crease on that number for low postage v/ili be ne-
cessary to produce as much revenue as is collected
at present. None of the estimates which T have
noticed, made by senators during the discussion,
put the number to be sent annually at less than
70,000,000. I shall take 60,000,000 as the basis of
my estimate:
60,000,000 of letters at 5 cents #3,000,000
5,000,000 of free letters  250,000
180 tons of public documents, at 2 cents
per ounce  1 lj>,000
Newspaper postage as at present  550,000
Treasury contribution  750,000
4,665,000
Many years cannot elapse before eighty or one
hundred millions of letters will be mailed annually;
our social relations will be vastly improved; the best
affections of the heart cultivated; knowledge will be
extended, and science and letters spread their bless-
ings through the length and breadth of the land.

SPEECH OF MR. MERRICK,
OF MARYLAND.
  Senate, February 21, 1845—On the joint resolu-
tion from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for
the annexation of Texas.
The Senate having resumed the consideration of
the joint resolution from the House of Representa-
tives for the annexation of Texas,
Mr. MERRICK addressed the Senate as fol-
lows:
Mr. President: The final hour of this Congress
is rapidly approaching, and our time is now pre-
cious in proportion as it is short and fleeting. I in-
tend not, therefore, to waste any of it in idle exor-
dium, or vain attempts at pompous peroration; but
my situation compels me, under the favor of the
Senate, to occupy the few moments which may be
requisite to present some of the thoughts which
have been crowding upon my mind from the com-
mencement of this discussion.
We are engaged, Mr. President, in no ordinary
act of legislation, but in the consideration of a meas-
ure winch deals with the fate of empires, and is to
affect, for weal or for wo, now and for ages yet to
come, millions upon millions of the Anglo-Ameri-
can race of freemen. On such an occasion it has
seemed to me that the voice of faction should be
hushed, and the contentions of ordinary party poli-
tics be awed into silence, and that the statesmen
who wield so mighty a power should seek the guid-
ance of the sublime lights of unimpassioned reason,
by which, disregarding all the ephemeral feelings,
interests, and agitations of the hour, and looking
only to the.high destinies involved, and the enduring
consequences to flow from their action, they should
determine to be governed. To this frame of mind
I have endeavored to bring myself in approaching
this great subject, not at all doubting, nor intending
to insinuate, that other gentlemen have not attempt-
ed the same thing, nor more successfully than my-
self. Yet, assuming this to be the case, it cannot
but strike the reflecting mind as strange, and hardly
to be accounted for, that we find opinions here very
nearly divided by ordinary party lines. And, while
this fact should reflect injuriously upon no one, it
cannot but teach us to ponder over the imperfection
of .the human faculties, and to think how nearly im-
possible it is to free the master power of human na-
ture, the attribute of reason, from the trammels of
early prejudices, temporary passions, and political
associations, which, in spite of ourselves, and out-
most vigorous efforts to soar above them, will often
give complexion, form, and pressure to our rnost
solemn judgments and gravest transactions. Wise-
ly, therefore, has it been advised that we should
"gently scan our fellow man;" and I trust that I
may be permitted to , ask for myself the benefit of
this wholesome admonition from any and all of my
associates here, to whom the opinions I am about to
utter may be unacceptable.
Mr. President, the course of this debate has been
such as to postpone all considerations of expedi-
ency and State policy, which would commend this
measure to our acceptance, to the investigation o
the deeper and more vital question, whether our
constitutional powers are competent to the end pro-
posed. This order is right; and I fully concur in
the sentiment so eloquently expressed by the sena-
tor from Massachusetts, [Mr. Choate,] that, were
Texas a terrestrial paradise, its sands all gold, its
streams ambrosial nectar, and its hills and rocks the
bread of life—though it should promise us peace
without end, and strength, prosperity, and glory
such as the world has never seen—yet should this
measure not be adopted here, if it be forbidden by
the constitution. To support that constitution wc
have all registered our oath in Heaven's chancery.
The obligations of that oath are paramount to all
earthly considerations; and there cannot he a sena-
tor here who would not spurn Texas from him as a
most loathsome, hideous thing, invested though
she might be with all the charms in which the rich,
the exuberant fancy of my friend from Massachu-
setts [Mr. Choate] could paint her, if she could be
obtained only by our making such a sacrifice. Con-
current, too, with the deep sense of this our high
obligation to preserve the constitution, there must
be in the breast of every senator feelings of nearly
equal force—a habitual love for that instrument in
which we have all been educated, and a giateful
recollection of the many and great blessings which,
we have enjoyed under it; the universal veneration
felt for the sages who framed and handed it down to
us; and a profound sense of the heavy responsibility
under which we all act as agents for our constitu-
ents. There can be none here, then, who would
knowingly impinge upon that sacred charter—none
who will not strive, gumma ope, to maintain, pre-
serve, and give it full, just, and appropriate scope or
operation, and no more. The senator from Massa-
chusetts [Mr. Choa-ie] must not, therefore, suppose
that he, and those who agree with him on this occa-
sion, are alone the firm supporters of the constitu-
tion; nor must he be surprised when I tell him that
ti is he wh© seems disposed, if any be, to mutilate
that sacred instrument; for his arguments would de-
stroy the plain sense and obvious import of the
grant of power now under consideration, and, by
construction, interpolate words to vary the sense
conveyed, and intended to be conveyed, and would
thus hand the constitution over to us and to our
successors shorn of its fair proportions, crippled in
one of its most important parts, imperfect and im-
potent for the effectuation of the grand designs of
its godlike framers, declared by themselves to be,
"To form a more perfect union, establish justice,
insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common
defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the
blessings of liberty to onrielves and our posterityto
several, if not all of which ends, the condition of
our country and of the world proclaims more loudly
than could the tongues of ten thousand orators ilia
the incorporation at this time ot Texas into thi.
