and is now shelling my advance. The size of my force and the long front I cover do not justify, in my opinion, an effort to attempt to force the enemy from his position. His artillery fire has ceased.

NEAR CROSSING OF RAILROAD AND TURNPIKE,

May 16, 1864-2.10 p. m.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: I am occupying the position held by use before we fell back from this front. A reconnaissance to the Appomattox shows but a small force in that direction, which fell back as our cavalry approached. I am occupying the railroad by cavalry pickets; the pikes by infantry. The rebels have about one battery of artillery. I cannot tell the amount of infantry. When I drew my advance back out of sight, their fire (artillery) ceased. i think they are not disposed to advance upon us. Am collecting and posting my men.

Yours, &c.,

A. AMES,

Brigadier-General.

A battery of rebel artillery and three regiments of their infantry are reported on the rising ground east of Port Walthall Junction and south of Bake-House Creek. All quiet.

Captain Dollard came in from a scout two hours ago. He went beyond Temple's; he saw nothing but the usual pickets on the Petersburg road.
