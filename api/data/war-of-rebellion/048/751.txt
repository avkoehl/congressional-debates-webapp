ing it near Widow Morris' house. My picket line remained. My ordnance officer collected on the battle- field such small- arms as he was permitted by the short time allowed him through the rapid movements of the corps, and destroyed a large number for which he had no transportation.

At 8 a. m., same day, I followed Carr's division toward Robertson's Tavern. I soon received orders to pass it, and found it in line of battle. On reaching the left of the Sixth Corps, I massed my division. Thence I marched to a point near Muddy Run, in rear of the left of the First Corps, and again massed. Under orders from Major- General French, I bridged Muddy Run, and pushed forward a strong reconnaissance to the heights, connecting on the right with the First Corps, my line forming almost a right angle with the line of that corps, occupying the position indicated by Major Duane, chief engineer. During the 29th my division was held in readiness for the expected assault.

Before daylight on the 30th, Prince's and Carr's divisions were withdrawn to the support of the movement by General Warren, and I received orders from General French to be prepared to assault the enemy in my front crossing Mine Run. Detaching the Third Michigan, One hundred and twenty- fourth New York, First and Second U. S. Sharpshooters, all under command of Colonel B. R. Pierce, Third Michigan (I relieved my entire picket line), and deploying the regiments named as an advanced line of skirmishers, connected with First Corps on the right and General Warren on the left, and driving the enemy's pickets from the bank of Mine Run, made crossings of rails and logs, and two bridges for artillery, so that the run would be no obstacle to a rapid advance in line of battle.

I deployed the second Brigade (Ward) as the second skirmish line in open order, with four companies from each regiment as supports, with orders to follow the advanced line at 200 paces. The First and Third Brigades were formed in line of battle, excepting the regiments detached for the support of the batteries.

At 8 a. m. the batteries opening on the right and center, Colonel Pierce gallantly pushed forward the advanced line, driving the first line of the enemy out of the advanced rifle- pits, capturing a few prisoners. Finding that the expected attack on the left was not made by General Warren, I had dispatched an aide, Lieutenant Moore, to Colonel Pierce, ordering him not to advance farther, when Major- General French ordered me to retire my demonstration and resume that position and formation of the 29th, the day before. At 6.30 p. m. on the 1st of December, my command followed Carr's division, bringing up the rear of the corps in the withdrawal by Culpeper Ford. The movement was a little delayed by the bad condition of the wood road, forcing the batteries to double teams to reach the plank road. On reaching the plank road, the movements of this division were greatly embarrassed by the cutting of the column by the ambulance trains and a column of a division of the Sixth Corps and the Second Corps. I reached this side of the Rapidan at Culpeper Ford at 5.30 a. m., 2nd instant, and bivouacked. The roads were so occupied by trains and troops that my division did not reach my former camp near Brandy Station until 5 a. m., 3rd instant. Annexed I submit a table of casualties*; also a report of Captain E. L.
