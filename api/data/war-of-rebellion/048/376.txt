about 2 miles of Brady Station. He gathered his men together, dashed through the rebel lines and made for Stevensburg. He saw infantry at that place marching toward Kelly's Ford. Captain Downing crossed the river at Richards' Ford. He thinks the enemy have considerable force of infantry and artillery opposite and above Kelly's Ford. Captain Downing deserves great credit for the determined and successful effort he made to save himself and command. My loss in the two days' fighting will not exceed 100.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: I am falling back on Gainesville, heavily attacked in rear. From Gainesville I shall fall back upon Groveton. There was no enemy from the direction of Thoroughfare Gap, but a heavy force of cavalry and artillery moving from the direction of Warrenton. There is heavy firing in the direction of General Warren's column-I should think near Greenwich.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Chief of Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,October 14, 1863-5.50 p. m.

COLONEL: I advanced with a strong force at 3.50 p. m. in the direction of Gainesville. We drove in the rebel pickets, and had a severe skirmish until dark. We succeeded in driving the enemy back on the road from New Market to Gainesville. A long column of cavalry, with a train of wagons, was seen moving from the direction of Bristoe to Gainesville. Darkness prevented me from learning more of the movements of the enemy. I am now encamped near Groveton. I have a strong force near New Market and Dusley Springs. I have parties out in the direction of Thoroughfare Gap. I hope to hear from them to-night. My scouting party sent to Aldie reports no enemy between Aide and this point, save White's guerrillas.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.
