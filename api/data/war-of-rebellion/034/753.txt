to Pomeroy and Gallipolis. I sent up boats to Colonel White, directing him to ship cavalry and a little infantry, and send up, under convoy of the gunboats, to Gallipolis or Pomeroy, as may be directed.

Colonel LUCY,

Commanding at Covington, Ky.:

Send out messenger to the commanding officer of your force at Alexandria, with instructions to keep a good lookout for the crossings at Liverpool, California, and Bealemont, and give early notice of any movement of the enemy.

MAYSVILLE, July 15, 1863-7.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND:

Arrived here this morning with most of forces. Our steamer Mellnott, with cavalry, not up. Cannot get any definite information of the enemy. Magnolia gone up the river. Will wait further orders.

MAHLON D. MANSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MAYSVILLE, July 15, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Morgan's line extends from near Georgetown to Eckmansville; he was, at 7 o'clock, moving toward Locust Grove. It will be very difficult to get a courier to Sardinia, as I would have to pass through his lines, but I can try. I have heard nothing from Judah.

MAHLON D. MANSON,

Brigadier-General.

MAYSVILLE, July 15, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND:

Part of Morgan's force came within 5 miles of Ripley at noon, from thence to Rusellville and Winchester. His advance is at West Union, and he is in force at North Liberty, 7 miles north of West Union. This information is considered reliable. I am patrolling the river from Ripley to Manchester. I think I can prevent his crossing. Have heard nothing from you to-day.

MAHLON D. MANSON,

Brigadier-General.
