Committee on the Removal of Political Dis-
abilities.
Mr. NORTON presented the petition of
George B. Dresbach and others, citizens of
Dre3bacb City, Minnesota, praying for an in-
creased and elastic volume of currency to the
extent of $300,000,000; such increase to be
made in installments of $25,000,000 or more, j
from time to time, of legal tenders, and to be
made exchangeable for a new issue of gold
interest-bearing bonds of the United States;
such interest to be made as low as loans are
negotiated by European Governmehts in good
credit, and payable in a new standard of coin
of equal fineness and value to the English and
Spanish gold and silver coins; and also praying
that $50,000,000 of coin or its equivalent be
at once recoined, the standard of such coinage
to be equal in fineness and value to the English
and Spanish coins; which was referred to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. FERRY. I present the memorial of
members of the bar of the county of New
Haven, State of Connecticut, remonstrating
against the transfer of the State of Connecti-
cut from the same circuit with New York, as
is proposed by a bill now pending before this
body. I know most of the memorialists. They
say that the association existing between the
courts of this district and the southern district
of New York, the assimilation of practice, the
close connection of business interests, the large
amount of important litigation brought in the
courts of this district by citizens of New York,
and the facilities of access to the circuit judge,
render it very much against the interest of the
people of Coanecticut that their district should
be taken away from the same circuit with the
southern district of New York. I move that
this memorial lie on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
SCHUYLKILL COUNTY COAL.
Mr. CAMERON. I am requested to present
a petition signed by many thousand laborers
and workmen of various kinds, but principally
miners in the county of Schuylkill, State of.
Fennyslvania, and as that county is the heart
of the anthracite coal region of our State, and
is the place where mining for coal first com-
menced in Pennsylvania, I desire to ask the
attention of the Senate for a few minutes while
I tell them something about the progtesa of
mining in that county.
Mr. President, ia presenting this petition I
wish to call the attention of Senators to the
interesting region from which it comes, and to
submit some facts concerning its wonderful
development, trusting that the exhibit will
prove useful by inducing this body to reflect on
the vast interests now held in the anthracite
and other coal-producing territory of the coun-
try. I am not without hope that an intelligent
study of this subject will show the importance
of suchlegislatiou as shall continue the develop-
ment of the coal-fields of the whole country,
and so prevent the destruction of the industries
which furnish a market for this important arti-
cle and mainly depend on its production.
All that I shall recount nas taken place
within my own memory and nitder my own
observation. When I was a yosng man the
land from which such vast wealth has been ex-
tracted was a wilderness. It conld be bought
for fifteen or twenty cents an acre, and no one
would haive it at any price. To pay the taxes
on k was deemed folly and extravagance.
Then population was sparse add comfort un-
known. Now this whole region teems with
a busy throng, and it has become the Abode
of opulence, intelligence, and refinement. On
the earth's surface the unending labor of well-
paid men goes on, and far down in the mines
thebnsy scenesofthe upper world are repeated.
The anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania,
which comprises all of any importance in the
coontry, is confined within an area of four
hundred and seventy square miles, or three
hundred thousand acres. I state this now, that
it may be remembered when I come to speak
of the enormous production which has been
attained and the vast capital which is now
invested in this coal territory. I present the
increase in mined coal and population in
Schuylkill county, Pennsylvania, giving the
figures with critical accuracy ; while as to the
population directly subsisting and attributable
to the mining interest in the remaining parts
of the hard coal region I estimate from re-
liable data and an intimate knowledge of the
locality and a personal observation of the sub-
ject.
The year 1820 marked the beginning of an-
thracite coal mining in our country. The
population of the county of Schuylkill—before
referred to—and the number of tons mined
were as follows, at the beginning of each decade
since 1820:
Year. Population.
1820  11,339 365
1830   20,784 89,984
1840    29,081 452.291
1850       63,205 1,712,01)7
1860   90,183 3,270,516
1870  133,000 4,748,969
. The population and production for the same
period in the entire four hundred and seventy
square miles of anthracite coal lands were as
follows; the population being estimated at a
low figure, and, I think, upon a basis which
will bear the closest investigation success-
fully:
Year. Population. Jj™{
1820   20,000 365
1830 ,  45,000 174.734
1840     70,000 864,384
1850   130,000 3,858,899
1860   220,007 8,412,946
1870      350,000 15,723,030
The amount of anthracite coal yet in the
earth is as follows, the area and the thickness
of the veins being accurately known:
Square Depth of T

Central coal fields  126 15 yards* 5,854,961,000

Which leaves of marketable ooal-  13,171,828,500
tons, or a deposit equal to an annual supply of
twenty million tons for six hundred years, and
of vastly greater valoe than all the mineral
deposits of tnany nations of the earth, and by
no means contemptible nations either.
But vast as this undeveloped wealth rs, and
astonishing as its development has been, it'is'
but a trifle when compared to the bituminous
coal deposits of our country, or indeed of
Pennsylvania. Within a circle of one hun-
dred miles, of which Pittsburg, in the western
extremity of my State, is the center, there is
enough bituminous coal in the earth to pay off
the national debts of all the Governments in
the world many times over. And it has been
estimated from geological surveys that this
coal would pay our national debt fifty-four times
if its stupendous value could be realized at
once. This, you will please remember, is in
western Pennsylvania alone, and only com-
prises one description of a particular wealth
which is surrounded and to some extent dwarifed
by other wonderful resources in that section
of our State.
It is impossible to overestimate the valae of
this wealth or its relations to other industries.
It is to-day-the foundation of our wealth, and
a glance at the distribution of bituminous coal
over the country indicates clearly to my mind
that development of this single interest is the
basis for a prosperity, under wise laws, which
would do more than anything else to render us
independent of external influence, however it
might be exerted.

bituminous and cannel coal deposits of the

square miles of coal within our borders, or
| more than thirty-one times as much as there
is in Pennsylvania, together with three hun-
dred square miles of anthracite in Rhode
Island and Massachasetts, and one hundred
! square miles in Oregon ; these, however, are
not important deposits, and are of very little
value.
These statistics are taken from Darrow's
1 Coal and Oil, and may be deemed as reli-
, able as any work on the subject attainable to
the student of such affairs. Those relating to
the anthracite coal are supplied by Mr. Ban-
nan, who for fifty years has observed and
: studied the subject.
j In Pennsylvania, notwithstanding her rugged
surface and her numerous mountain chains,
! in spite of the fact that a mila of railroad in
: our State costs many times as much as in some
others, we now have more mites of railroad
' than any other State in the Union, while our
I capital invested in these far surpasses that of
any other, arotrantting in the aggregate to
$800, OOO,OO0. '
As aft indication of tlje value of coal in
; developing nearly every description of internal
i improvement, let me call your attention to the
I fact that to carry our Schuylkill anthracite
coals to market we have invested in—
Railroads       830,000,000
Canals  ".  22;000,000
Mining operations and lands  18,000,000
While in the residue we have in-
90,000,000
Railroads   56,000,000
Canals  49,000,000
Mining operations and lands 13,000,000
A grand total of.     $208,000,000
The amount invested in like improvements
for sending our bituminous coal forward X
have no means of accurately determining, but
it is very large ; for the greater area and the
greater distance inland at which our soft or
bituminous coal is placed involves a greater
outlay for transportation. The yield of this
description during the last year was 14,117,628
tons, and was chiefly produced .from the State
of Pennsylvania. And while the capital in-
vested in mining operations is not so large as
in the anthracite region, this marked difference
exists between these great interests, and is well
worthy of remembrancethe bituminous coal
is situated far in the interior; it suffers greater
wastage in mining and carriage than hard coal,
and it is open to the competition of a foreign pro-
duct, having all the advantage of cheap ocean
carriage, while our soft coal must rely on artifi-
cial modes of transportation, built at enormous
expense over a great mountain range, to bring
it to tide-water and an eastern market.
It will be observed that these coal miners do
