MAJOR: Your letter of instructions of the 19th instant inclosing a communication from W. J. Britton, esq., received. Relative to that portion of it instructing concert of action between Major [L.] Mims and myself, in order to secure a uniformity in the purchase price of articles on the part of our respective agents, I would reply that such arrangement has already been made, and by reference to the inclosed papers* you will perceive that, as early as February 13, I instructed Mr. John McFarland to take possession of the steam transport Edward J. Gay, and send her immediately to Snyder's Bluff, to place a grist-mill upon her, and use her for storing and grinding corn into meal, to be turned over to the commissary for the troops on Yazoo River. You will perceive that the boat was taken for some other purpose. The commissary of the SECOND Military District has been furnished with the list of prices governing the agents of Major Mims and myself.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THEO. Johnston,

Major and Chief of Subsistence.
