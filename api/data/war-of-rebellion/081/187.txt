HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 18, 1864-7.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE:

SIR: I have moved as far as I can safely hold. One brigade on the left of the railroad, the balance on the right. The field between me and the troops to my right is swept so with canister that I can't occupy it until the enemy's batteries are silenced. The enemy's works are within musket-range of my pickets on my left. I am repairing the bridge across the railroad cut, which the enemy burned, so as to get a battery across the railroad. Shall I call in my pickets on the Blackwater, or let them remain?

Very respectfully,

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

JUNE 18, 1864-11.55 a.m.

General CUTLER:

General Warren directs that you move forward to attack the enemy at 12 m. You will move on the left of General Griffin, who will advance at the same time. This attack is general along the whole line of the army.

By order of General Warren:

W. A. ROEBLING,

Aide-de-Camp.

General Ayres will look out from your left.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 18, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Corps:

My first line is on the crest about 600 yards in front of the enemy's works, a plateau in front of me. Does the general wish me to move farther now? What Major Roebling handed me as an order was only a blank piece of paper, and I am at a loss. Colonel Chamberlain understands that he was to take the crest where I am.

Very respectfully,

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.

[Colonel LOCKE:]

At 2.45 p.m. June 18 I received a dispatch, which I have mislaid or lost, in substance, as follows:
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

General CUTLER:

You will move on the enemy's works at 3 o'clock. General Ayres will move on your left. This movement is general along the whole line.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

I moved immediately after.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
