HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, April 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General IMBODEN,

Mount Crawford, Va.:

GENERAL: I believe Major Poor, engineer of this department, by my direction has seen and conferred with you, but for certainty I send a few lines.

I observe that by authority from the War Department you are organizing the reserve forces in Allegheny, Botetourt, and certain other counties. I have had a work completed at the railroad bridge over the Cow Pasture, and have ordered another at the railroad bridge over New River, and rifle-pits at Island Ford. These latter should be done very soon. By this time I think the road through McGraw's Gap has been destroyed. Colonel Jackson's command is the only one I can rely on for sudden service in that region. He has been directed to look to the approaches to these points. I presume you will have the reserve forces of Allegheny, Botetourt, Rockbridge, &amp;c., ready to occupy these positions if necessary.

I am, general, respectfully and truly,

JNO. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
