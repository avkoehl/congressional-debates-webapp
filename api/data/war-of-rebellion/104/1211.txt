Captain W. A. PERCY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Jackson, Miss:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that my scouts at Messinger's Ferry report that the enemy come out nearly every day as far as Clear Creek, eight miles from Vicksburg, in squads of 25 and 100 men. They captured two of Henderson's scouts and four dismounted men of this brigade on the 3rd instant. The Fourth Missouri Cavalry is all the mounted troops near Vicksburg, numbering 750 men, of which some 500 remain in the city, and 250 are guarding the railroad between Big Black and Vicksburg. They can hear nothing of an anticipated raid in this direction. I am now encamped three miles from Canton on the Vernon road, not being able to get a camp on the Livingston road. I have some corn at Canton, and will be able to get enough to last me until I can get corn from Grenada, as my train is still hauling forage to the railroad at Vaughan Station.

I am, captain, very respectfully,

DUD. W. JONES,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
