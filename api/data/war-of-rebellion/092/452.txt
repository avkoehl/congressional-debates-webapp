II. Corps commanders will direct a careful inspection to be made this p. m., to ascertain that every infantry soldier has his forty rounds of ammunition and that the batteries have their ammunition- chests well filled. Every commissioned officer in this army is reminded that our supply of ammunition is limited to that we have on hand, and that therefore the greatest possible economy must be observed in its use. The attention of corps and division commanders is called to the manner in which outpost duty is performed. Each division commander will select a permanent picket officer, one who is intelligent and indefatigable. It has been noticed several times that the pickets have come in a disorderly manner, often singly and without orders. This practice must be corrected. Attention is again called to straggling. To prevent it great care will be taken in the detail of foragers. A provost guard to each brigade. Commissioned officers will be arrested and punished for allowing straggling. All quartermasters will be held strictly responsible for the men in their charge. Corps commanders will regulate, in orders, foraging parties for their trains as well as fort he infantry and artillery. Special attention is called to the Field Orders, nos. 119 and 120, of Major-General Sherman, copies of which will be multiplied, so that every commissioned officer may have one in his possession. *
