HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 8, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: I know that Gibbon could be recalled if the commanding general did not wish him to go to Warren, but I believe I did right in sending him the division. Still I should like to have his views as to what I shall send on subsequent application, or whether I shall await orders from headquarters of the army.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.

MAY 8, 1864-1.30 p.m.

COMMANDING OFFICER SECOND CORPS:

I am instructed to inform you that General Sedgwick is directed to re-enforce Warren with his whole corps, and both to make a vigorous attack upon the enemy in the vicinity of Spotsylvania Court-House immediately. Longstreet's corps is there.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

SIGNAL STATION, NEAR TODD'S TAVERN, May 8, 1864-3 p.m.

Captain P. A. TAYLOR:

Observe a heavy dusk rising on road due west from this point and about 7 miles distant; think it is infantry moving on road leading from Parker's Store to Craig's Meeting-House. Battery observed in our front 1 1/2 miles distant in southwesterly direction is now disappearing toward our left in woods in direction of Catharpin road.

J. E. HOLLAND,

Lieutenant, Signal Corps.

Also two or three columns of black smoke are seen, apparently along about White Hall Mill; fires, no doubt.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 8, 1864-3.40 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Have just returned from an examination of the Catharpin road. Found a brigade well posted on the heights this side of Corbin's Bridge, overlooking the Po River, a commanding position and overlooking the enemy's line. He was seen moving south; had several guns in position; occasionally uses them. Our cavalry is being withdrawn from that flank. The main line crosses the Catharpin about half a mile west of Todd's Tavern. All quiet at present in that direction.

N. MICHLER,

Captain, Engineers.
