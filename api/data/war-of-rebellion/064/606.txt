I have authorized General Sully to employ, arms, and clothe for temporary service at their respective agencies as many friendly Indians as may be needed for their protection. This was done at the request of Indian agents.
HDQRS. DIST. O MINN., DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,Saint Paul, Minn., June 30, 1864.

Major JOHN CLOWNEY,

Commanding Detach. en route to Forts Wadsworth and Ridgely:

MAJOR: Your several dispatches of 29th instant have been received, and General Sibley is gratified to learn of the safe arrival of the command at Fort Ridgely, with the single exception of the teamster referred to, whose unfortunate end is to be deplored. Major Downie left this morning for the upper Minnesota, and was intrusted with the plats or plans of Fort Wadsworth. While you will be governed in the building of the post by the plans furnished, so far as the nature of the spot select for that purpose will admit, there is a probability that some peculiarity of the ground may require a slight variation or some slight changes, which will not materially interfere with the general arrangement laid down, in which case you are authorized to make such needed alterations. Your request that the command should receive their pay before the march has been referred to Major Phinney, paymaster, for his consideration, with the information that the command will not leave Fort Ridgely before Monday, 4th proximo, or probably later. No order can be given in the case, but the major will probably later. No order can be given in the case, but the major will probably provide for the payment if he has the means to do so. The train of supplies for Fort Wadsworth will probably reach Fort Ridgely on 2nd proximo.

By command of Brigadier-General Sibley.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
