REMARKS OF MR. MARVIN,
Of Nkw  York,
IntlieBouAeofRepreoeiilalicbS, Tkwsday, July 5, 1838—
On the bill making appropriations for new haibors, and for
oiher purposes
Mr MARVIN said he had made several efforts to obtain the
floor for the purpose of submitting to the committee some re
mirks upon the subject now under cunb'deiation I am aware,
(said he,) Mr Chairman that theíe is now little time left for
debate Our existence here as a legislative body is dtawing ra
pidly to a close, and we have many impcu tant measures v et to
actupon 1 should not fetl my sell itistifiable now in occupy
ing the time of the committee, weie it not foi the violent and
perseveimg opposition which has b en manifested toward  this
hill and the bill which passed in this body yesterday, making
aopropriations for the coitmuance of tlie public works on
those harbois, &c already begun I now pi omise the commit
tee that I will be brief, while I feel that I have a light to ask
their attention to thafacts which it is mypuipose to adduce
Durmg the d h .te oi yesterday and this evening, almost all the
speaking has been in opposition to the bills, and a toi tent oí elo
quetice has\> en experded against the sj^tem of haiboi and
nver it ipiovcmants and gentlemen have iwln'gcd in fancy
sketches of the prodigal an I wa->tefi 1 expenduu.it o' the pub
I c money m removing obstructions f>om the months of all the
1 t le creeks wnich emptv into the Ides It has been stated
here, in debate that iai2esa"as have been expended to ícmove
obstructions f om creeks which might be oo^ed at'onestep
mil I have noticed, during the deb te, that tne letirrks of gen
tlemen li vp hem mi nly directed to th° haibors on the lakes
and any on* who should listen to ti e urn irks made litis would
naturally suppose, if he had no previous kaowjedge <:n the
subject, that untold millions had been expended on these lakes
and thatahaiboi was m the process oi con&tiuction at the
mouth of every river, creek, streamlet, and mitt which dis
ch rgesu t uhe Iake<=, ard that these improvements aie made,
not son uc¡ foi die benefit, security, and piotection of com
meice a* 1 >r the benefit of speculators I represent a distnct,
s i, wh cli boi 'ei& upon tlte lakes—a constituency deeply inte
rented in tl e commerce of the uppei lakes, and I should be
Jau'dess io the trust thuy have it posed m me and faithless to
my own fetlmss, were Ho remain longer s lent, when ==o great
injunue, \s 1 Relieve, is done to that system, which aims to
render safe the navigation of these great inland seas No gen
tleman, 11 these debates ui on the bil s uenommated the "har
bir bills, hai en en the commi tee an account «r*« alemenluí
the an tint of business doing on the lake*, all the remaiKs
winch h* ve lem made in lavor of the b lis have been of a
ge terai ctn ac er Aol gentlemen may noLbe a *ate of the
true elite oi ihe ca c, and of the great importance to the toun
try it lar^e of having safe and commodious harbors upon these
waters As to the popnety of the appropilations for the
rivers, harbois, md breakwaters along the 3eaeud&t and at the
South, Iprufts to have hule knowledge I confine my icinarks
to the public works on the lakes
And now Mi Chaiiman,arter all you havcheaid, how many
harooisd > you suppo e there aic upon which the Umud ¡states
hive exjenled money, begmniig with lake Champlam, and
ending with Lake Michigan, a coast of nearly or quite twenty
five hundred miles?   Why, sir the bill which passed this ilou^e
yesterday sHjws the whole number to be twenty five    I must
bt horned in mind that theie aie but very few natuial haibois
on any of these lakes    Does this look   sir, like building a har
b i at th   t lomh of eveiy little < icek?   Here is i coast oí twen
ty five huidrtti m.ie-i n extent, and upon all the^e lakes a com
merctahealy laige an i lapidiy increisng, and which, but for
th &eamt en haibo s, could not becauiedon   But, sir, we hive
h°<ud much ofth^enotmous expense of these haibors   Do g n
tWnen «.noww hat the expense h is been"? how much the Govern
merit has evei expend*.d upon these important nation il vvoiks^
Why, sn  we talk here m round numbers   i d  it se nis to be
much easiei tu pi mounct millions than thousand    perhaps, this
i  owing to the fact that most o our appropriations aie coun ed
m millions m lead of thousand* , and especially appiopuanons
fir the siipt us ion of Indian ho/uume   lor the lafihxatior of In
dian treaties tin support of the ai my and navy, &c    But to re
turn  to ni) question, how muih m   the Government ever ex
rend°l on the haib ir^ofthe l«k si   I like to be a little pii icu
In when there is so mucn violent oj politic n to the ' ha b i
bill,   to the system of in ein=il improvcmen    a-, many gentle
nen choose to ca'l it     Ihe «en lenian fr   n  \ ermoi t  [Mi
Hill 1 who hesju^t ta¿en his seat   ha* made up his mind o
vo e against this bill and he 1 as lead to u-< a s ^terient < I ihe
sums expended, withm d. few ytais pa&t on   woika denomi      j
nited internal improvements in wlith these harbors die m     '
eluded, and, if I undei stood him correetly, it was over ten ml     i
lions, but he does not tell w wha' portion oí this amount has    '
been need in the construction of harbors on the 'Northern ind     j
Noith western lakes    It has occurred tome thu these bills have
an improper title, oi rather an unfortunate title lor the pom    !
lake harbors— an act to  provide for certain  harbors     &c
Thus the harbors are pHred m the fore ground  they are th°
van guar!, and whatever o herappiopnations the b llmav c n
tain, the haibors receive the whole fiie ot the enemy mdsuiii
the shockof battie, which  s waged with su much ski I a d '-pi
rit by our So tthem fi lends, whose mode of wai Jare, if victo y
were to perch upon their oanner, w ould forever deprive the no
ble steamer, thebfld ship schooner, and brig, of a haibn of
safety, and leave them and their rich height, with the thou
sands of American citizens who have tins ed themselves And
their fortunesonboaid, to the mercj of the waves and the winds
of a fickle and unsteady climate     They leave no constitutional
ground for the harbors to rest upon    AH these appropi lation",
m their estimation, are unconstitutional    I shall not now stop
to debate the cons'ltutionality of these appropnations    I have
remarked that it is unfortunate for the h irbors that the bills con-
taining appropriations for them should be called "the harbor
bills," for these bills frequently appropriate large sums for
ttherpurposes   And we Wrgentlemeri continually referring
to the' haiborbiil" as containing an appropriation ari rmlhon
e 11 a half, and \,hen these b lis are urdei ^'scuss'on, cm eais
au cmtirua'ly dmned vith harboi ' haibor t h?ilW on the
ntilefie hwatei ponds ofthe ¿vouhud Nn h\ est' And alt
the peals and changes are i une upon the woid of which it is sus
tepuble Undei these encumstances, I am unwilling that the
impiession should go abro-ulrhat large sums have been mipro
peily expended in constructing harbors on the lakes And if I
can help i', they shall not bear all the odium v, hich some gen
tlemen atfith to all the appiopnations contained in what is
called the1 J«aiboi bill '
I have taken the tiouble, sir, to ascertain from an offieial
sourcethe txactamount whichhasevei been expended m the
construction of harbors upon all the Northern and Northwest
em lakes ai d the wnole amount is only a fraction over one
midion si\ hundied thousand dollars Sir, I will not institute
a eompanv n between th*1 sums expended on this extensive
Northern and Nouhwestern frontier and othei seca ne¡ of the
Union The commeicial power of this country is under the
control of this Government One of the most important chites
imposed upon the Government of the United States is the le
gulation of commerce with foreign nations and among these
vera! States, and this power to ltguhte commetceis coexten
sive with the junsdiUion of the entire Union, and I maintain
that the obligation on the par  of the United States to protect
the commeiceof Ohio, of Michigan, or Illinois isi&stiongas
it is to protect the commerce oí any of the Atlantic States By
undertaking to institute a compauson of expenditure* foi
the purpose of ascertaining in what section ot the country oi
in what totate the largest ippiopuationshave been made, with
out regarding the w ntsof commeice, you descend horn that
elevated p rnion which a statesman and a patriot should ever
occupy, who looks upon the whole country as oi e and united
tor the ptupose-,of wirand deience, and for the purposes oí
commerce lint mi I will a«=k the question when and vvheie
Ins theie e^ er been the «urn of &l,b00,000 expended by this Go
vunment which has, i educed a gi eater amount ol good, which
has yieídeu i richer hai \ e t, than the ¡sixteen hundred thousand
dollars which hav e been appropi tated and expended m the con
struction of these haihoit,* I have not examined particularly,
and therefoit cannot sute tne amount which ba& been expend
ed on a single wtrk, ihe Delawaie breakwater but I believe,
I shoul 1 r o* grea ly ei r by pi esuming that as much has been
expended on thatwoik alont as ill that has been expended

shall h< ar no moieot the pnoimous sums of public money
which have bten «quanleicdon the harbors Ev<n the bill

and which was called so emphatically the "hiihor bi 1 ' and
