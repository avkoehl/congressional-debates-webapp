Major J. W. LATTA,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to request that First Lieutenant J. A. O. Yeoman, First Ohio Veteran Volunteer Cavalry, may brevetted for gallantry in the charge at Montevallo, in the fight at Ebenezer Church, in the advance on Columbus when he followed the enemy so closely with two men as to prevent their burning the bridges. He also behaved with his usual conspicuous gallantry in the charge into Girard. Lieutenant Yeoman is an officer of education, a good disciplinarian, and has been of great value as the inspector-general of this brigade.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. J. ALEXANDER,
