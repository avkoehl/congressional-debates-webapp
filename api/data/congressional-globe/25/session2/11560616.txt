Jndepentdenl Treasury—Mr. Clay of Kg.
Senate 
sure has produced many salutary oonsequenees It. checked the
career ofthe Western banks, and gave ihem additional strength
m anticipation oí the passure which has since peivaded our
Eastern Ob well a* the buiopean commercial cities By pie
venting the expansion of the credit sjstem, it measurably cut
off the means of speculation and retarded itprogrcsainmoropo
hzing the most valuable of the public lands It has tended to
save the new States liom a non usident proprietorship— one of
the greatest obstacles to the advaicementof a new country and
the prosperity of an old one It has tended to keep open the
public lands ior entry by emigrants at Government prices^ in
«tead of their being compelled to purchase of speculator at
double or treble prices \nd it is conveying into the interior
large sums in silver and gold, there to enter permanently into
the currency of the country, and place it on a firmer foundation
It is confidently believed that the country will find, in the mo
uvea which induced that order, and the happy consequences
which have ensued, much to commend and nothing to con
demn "
It is seen that he again calls the attention of Congress to the
currency of the rotmtiy alleges that it was apparent fiom the
whole context of the Constitution, as well as the history ofthe
times that gave buth to it, that it was the purpose of t con
vention to est iblish a currency consisting ofthe preciousmrtals,
imputes variableness and a liability to inordinate contraction
and expansion to the existing paper system, and denounce*
bank issues as b^mg an ure-tJttdmbtandaid He felicitates him
self upon the dingeis which have oeen obviated by the over
throw ofthe Ban' of the United Sute*, but declaies that little
has been yet dome, except to produce a salutary change of pub
he opinion toward* ie?toringto the country the sound cuuency

yet, m about a week after the adjournment oí Coi gie s, the
principle which met with no ountenanre from the legsia'ive
authority, was embodied in the foun of a Treisur) ediet "nd
promulgated under the Executive authority, to the astonish
ment ofthe people of the United ¡statt/s*
If we possessed no o Iierevidmce whatever ofthe hostility of
of President íackson to the State banks of the United States,
that older would suppiy conclusive p-oof Bank notes, bank
issues, bank credits, wuedistius'el and denounced by him It
was proclaimed to the people that th"y were unwoitoy of con
íídencé The Government could no longer trust 11 then secu
rity And ata mompnt when the bankng opeia ions were ex
tended and stretched to their utmost tension, vthentley weie
almost all tottering ana ready to fall fot tht want of that metal
iic basis on which they all tested the Executive aun unces its
distrust issues the Treasuiy order and enters the maiket for
sppcie by a demand of an extiaordmary amount to suppiy the
means of purchasing the public lands It the sales hadctn
tmuedm the same iatio they had be<m made duruv the pre
nous year that i , at about the nte of twenty four mi'hons 1 er
annum, this unprecedented demand created by Government foi
specie must have exhau&ted the vaults of most ofthebankb,
and producedmuch sooner the catastrophe wh ch orcurrel in
May last And, what is more extraordinary, this wanton de
mand for specie upon all the banks 01 the commercial capitals,
and in th^busy and thickly peopled portions ofthe country, was
that a might be transported into the wildtnesb an I iltei ha
mg beea used m the purchase of public lands deposited to the
credit ofthe Government in the books of WWpin bank , in
«ome of which, accoidingto the message there were air aly
credits to the Government "gieatly beyond their immediate

"The Constitution of the United States unquestionably in
tended to secure to the people a circulating medium of gold and
silver But the establishment of a National Bank by Congress,
with the privilege of issuing paper money receivable m pay
mem. of the public dues and the unft« túnate cause of legisla
uon m the several States upon the samt subjecf, drove lion
general circulation the constitutional currency, and substituted
one of paper in its place
"The mischief springs from the power which tlie moneyed
interest derives from a papei currency which they are ¿hie to
