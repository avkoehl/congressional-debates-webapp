NEW MARKET, February 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

GENERAL: The Quartermaster-General seems to think that there is corn in the country. Some of the people in the mountains [are] out of the country to avoid starvation. We have now but a few days of corn. I had expected the Quartermaster-General to aid us. He thinks now that he cannot aid us; if so, we must go back and devote ourselves more to feeding and taking care of our stock. i doubt if it can be done many days with all our energies devoted exclusively to that. Please telegraphed me and let me know if I can get no aid from virginia.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
