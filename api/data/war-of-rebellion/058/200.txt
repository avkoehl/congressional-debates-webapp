HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS,Lookout Valley, Tenn., January 24, 1864.

Major General C. SCHURZ,

Commanding Eleventh Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that in the movement of the Third Division, Eleventh Corps, to-morrow, the transportation belonging to that division may be insufficient to transport their camp and garrison equipage, &amp;c.; if so, he thinks you had better use all the wagons belonging to the corps, or enough of them to transport all the baggage, and when the movement is completed return such wagons as may belong to the Second Division. the wagons of the Second Division that are used had better be loaded with the baggage belonging to the brigades of the Third Division, which halt at the posts nearest here - Whiteside's and Shellmound.

Very respectfully,

H. W. PERKINS,

Lieutenant, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
