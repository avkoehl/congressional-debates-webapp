its exercise, and it is believed that the surplus of
balances on hand under some of the appropriations
would usually prove sufficient tosupply the wants
under otheis. The detail and earnestness with
which legislation on this subject is now urged,
must find their excuse in my strong convictions
that no measure whatever, requiring like this no
increased expenditures, could be more conducive
to the reputation and efficient operations of our
naval establishment.
Thus, sir, under an examination of its cf ntral
administration, of its personal, or civil and Navy
list, of its materials, with the appurtenants there-
to, and of its miscellaneous concerns, I have sub-
mitted a review of all its transactions and expend-
itures, during the past year, that possess any
great degree of importance. This has been ac-
companied by suggestions for such improvements
as observation and reflection have convinced me
might be useful; and should they meet with the
approbation of yourself and Congress, I look for-
ward with confidence to a long continuance of
prosperity in the affairs connected with this De-
partment.
With great respect,

REPORT  OF  THE  POSTMASTER GEN
ERAL.
General Post Office Department,
November 30, 1833.
To the President of the United States:
Sir: When, in, 1829, the functions of this De-
partment devolved upon me, the annual transpor-
tation of the mail amounted to 13,700,000 miles.
The contracts then in existence, with the other
expenses of the Department, had, within the year
ending the 30ih of June, 1829, diminished its sur-
plus revenue $101,256 03, and those contracts
weie still in force from one to four years in pros-
pect.
The surplus available revenue had been reduced
to the nominal amount of...........$230,849 07
But it has subsequently been ascer-
tained that there had been expenses
incurred for transportation performed
prior to the 1st ot July, 1829, which
v/ere not embraced in that account, to
the amount of.....................    64,248 76
which reduced the real surplus to... $166,600 31
The annual transportation of the mail was, on
the 1st of July, 1833, 26,854,485 miles.
The annual amount of the transportation of the
mail in stages and steamboats, on the 1st of July,
1829, was 6,507,818 miles.
The annual amount of the transportation of the
trail in stages and steamboats, on the 1st of July,
1833, was 18,322,576 miles.
The expet se of tiansporting the mail for the
year ending the 30th of June, 1829, was $1,153,-
646 21.
The expense of transposing the mail for the
year ending 30th of June, 1833, was §1 894,688 08.
The gross amount of postages, constituting the
revenues of the Department, was, for the year
ending 30th of June, 1829, $1,707,418 42
The gross amount of postages for the year
ending 30th of June, 1833, was £2 616 538 27
The incidental expenses of the Department for
the year ending 30th of June, 1829, amounted to
$69,249 08
The incidental expenses of the Department for
the yeai ending 30th of June, 1833, amounted to
$87,701 61.
The number of post office? in the United States
on the 1st of July, 1829, was 8,004
On the 1st of July, 1832, the number of post
offices m the United States was 10,127.
The mci ease of the annual transportation of the
mail with'n the four years ending the 30th June,
1833, is 13,1)4,485 miles, nearly equal to the
whole amount ot transportation in 1829.
The increase of the annual amount of postages
wi'lun the «ame peuod is §909,119 85, and the
whole arrooi t is moie than the double of what it
was in 1S25
The average expense of transporting the mail
in 1829 was eight cents and four tenths of a cent
pei mile.
The average expense of transporting the mail
in 1833 is seven cents and fifty-seven hundredths
of a cent per mile; making a diffeience m the
rate per mile of eighty-three hundredths of a
cent, equal, for the whole service, to $222,892 22
per year less, in pioportion to the service per-
formed, than the expense of transportation in
1829, besides a great increase in expedition be-
tween the principal commercial cities, and a much
greater proportion of the whole performed in
stages.
After carrying into effect the law of the last
Congress establishing new mail routes, the present
length of railroads in the United States amounts
to 119,916 miles, viz:

i The method in which the accounts of the ex-
I penses of transposing the mail have always been
1 kept in this Department, has led to a misappre-
hension of the means of extending improvements
I in mail facilities. It appears from the earliest
i records of the Department to have been a íule not
to enter to the credit of a contractor, nor to charge
to the account of transportation, the expense of
carrying the mail on his route, till after he had
signed his contract and bond, and returned them
to the Department with proper security .though the
service may have been regularly performed, and,
in many instances, the moneys actually paid. It
has sometimes happened that contracts of the great-
est magnitude have, from various causes, remained
for more than a year unreturned. In such cases,
though the expenses have been incut-red, they do
not appear in the transportation aecount;andtnough
the moneys may have been paid to the contractors,
they stand on the books as balances to that amount
due fiom them to the Department, constituting a
partof its surplus fund, when, m fact, they consti-
tute a part of the actual expense incurred for the
transportation of the mail. The consequence has
been, that the expenses for transporting the mail
within any given period of time, as shown in the
accounts, and reported annually through the Ex-
ecutive, have been always calculated to exhibit an
amount considerably less than what has actually
been incurred. This is an imperfection not of
recent origin, but one which appears to have been
coexistent with the Department. When the num-
ber of contracts was few, and the surplus revenue
bore a large ratio to its whole annual amount, the
effect was unimportant; but in the increased num-
ber of mail routes, and the diminution of its sur-
plus revenue, it was calculated to produce serious
inconvenience. From the statements growing out
of this system, thus illusory in their results, to-
gether with the great expense of carrying into
effect the law of the last Congress establishing new
mail routes, and a disposition to gratify the wishes
of the public in the improvement of mail facilities,
I was led to carry those improvements to an extent
which it was found the resources of the Department
would not well sustain. When the inconvenience
was felt, the cause was carefully investigated, and
the following result was disclosed. Prompt direc-
tions were given for the correction of the error in
future. It is not possible to determine, to an exact
certainty, the whole expense incurred for trans-
portation within any recent period; because it
will often happen that improvements will become
necessary, even for the fulfilment of existing laws,
the expense of which, for want of proper evidence,
must be reserved for subsequent adjustment, and
so come into the account for a later period than
that in which the services were performed. But
these variations are of an inconsiderable amount
compared with the differences resulting from the
system heretofore observed.
On the 30th of June, 1829, which was the close
of the first quarter in which I had assumed the
functions of the Department, the expenses which
had been incurred for transporting the mail were
$64,248 76 more than the amount stated in my
report to that day.
On the 1st day of July, 1832, the day to which
my last report reaches, there was stated to be a
surplus of available funds, after defraying all the
expenses of the Department up to that day, of
$202,811 40
It is, however, now ascertained that
the  expenses incurred for trans-
portation which had actually been
performed prior to  the 1st July,
1832, beyond the amount stated in
that report, were...............    205,656 07
So that, instead of a surplus on that
day, the Department was actually
indebted, on the 1st day of July,
1832, beyond the whole amount
of its available funds, admitting
that no losses of postages should
be sustained...................        2,844 67
