TWELFTH KENTUCKY INFANTRY BAND.
Mr. SHERMAN. I now ask the indulgence
of the Senate to pass the two private biils to
which I called attention a moment or two ago.
I move to take up House joint resolution
No. 124.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Ohio asks unanimous consent, the morning
business having been concluded, to take up two
private bills for consideration.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the joint resolution (H. R. No. 124) for
the relief of John M. Broome and others, the
band of the twelfth Kentucky infantry. The pre-
amble recites that John Martin Broome, leader
of the band of the twelfth regiment Kentucky
volunteer infantry, and Adam Shilling, Chris-
tian Kuboz, George Scott, and Rudolf Van-
deran, musicians of the first class, George
Hoeflinger, Peter Oehlschlager, John Eck, and
Philip VVeis, musicians of the second class,
and Alois Berg and Philip Hermann, (the last
named having died in hospital on the 31st of
March, 1862,) musicians of the third class,
were enlisted as the band of musicians of the
twelfth Kentucky infantry, on the 3d of Jan-
uary, 1-862, and performed service and were
discharged by the authority of law and military
regulations as the band of the regiment until
the 10th of September, 1862, without having
been paid, and without having furnished to the
War Department the proper rolls of muster-in
and muster-out of service. The joint resolu-
tion therefore directs the proper officers of the
War and Treasury Departments to allow them
the same pay and allowances from the time of
their enlistment to the date of their discharge
as though their muster-rolls had been properly
furnished and were in all respects regular.
Mr. PQMEROY. Is that reported from a
committee?
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes, sir; and it has passed
the Senate twice before.
Mr. POMEROY. It proposes to pay these
persons from the date of their enlistment.
We have always heretofore said, the date of
muster-in.
Mr. SHERMAN. This is the usual course
in such cases. This bill, I will inform the Sen-
ator, has passed this body twice, has passed the
House of Representatives twice, but it has so
happened in going backward and forward that
it has not become the law of the land. It is a
German band, and payment ought to be made.
The joint resolution was reported to the Sen-
ate without amendment, ordered to a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.
WILLIAM AND JOIIN IIANNEGAN'S SURETIES.
Mr. SHERMAN. There is another bill,
House bill No. 1395, for the relief of some of
my constituents, reported from the Committee
oil Claims, which I should like to have taken up.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (H. R. No. 1395) for the relief
of Charles Cooper, Goshorn A. Jones, Jerotne
Rowley, William Hannegan, and John Ilan-
negan. It proposes to release Charles Cooper,
Goshorn A. Jones, Jerome Rowley, William
Hannegan, and John Hannegan from all lia-
bility to the United States, under and by reason
of their bond executed thereto to secure the
faithful performance by William and John Han-
negan of their contract with the Government
of the United States for the improvement of
Des Moines rapids, of the Mississippi river,
in the State of Iowa; and it directs that the
action at law now pending in the United States
district court for the northern district of Ohio to
enforce the bond be discontinued by the proper
officer of the Government at the cost of the
defendants. This is not to be construed to
give the parties, or any of them, any claim or de-
mand against the Government under the eon-
-No
tract or bond, or to affect in anyway any claim
or demand which they, or any of them, may
have or make against the Government under
the contract or bond, for the recovery from
Government of any part of the fifteen per cent,
reserved by the Government under the pro-
visions of the contract. The second section
proposes to make it lawful for John Hannegan
and William Hannegan to institute and prose-
cute an action in the Court of Claims against
the United States for the recovery of any part
of the reserved per cent, mentioned in the pre-
ceding section to which they may believe them-
selves entitled in law or equity.
Mr. SHERMAN. The Committee on Claims,
if I remember aright, reported an amendment
striking out the last section. I am willing that
should be done, although I think it is a hard
case.
The amendment of the Committee on Claims
was to strike out the second section, in the fol-
lowing words:
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted. That it shall be
lawful lor said J ohn Ilanneptan and Wllliam llanne-
gan to institute and prosecute an action in the Court
of Claims against tho United States for the rceovcry
of any part of the reserved per cent, mentioned in
tho preceding section to which they may believe
themselves entitled in law or equity.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed, and the araendmeut was concurred in.
The amendment was ordered to l?e engrossed
and the bill to be read a third time. The bill
was read the third time, and passed.
