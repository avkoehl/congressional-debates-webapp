Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio; Governor MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind.;

Governor YATES, Sprigfield, Ill.; Governor SALOMON, Madison, Wis.;

Governor BLAIR, Detroit, Mich.:

Don't remit our exertions in hastening forward your troops. Cincinnati is threatened, whether seriously or not I cannot confidently say, but we must be prepared; moreover, we must take the offensive at an early day or we allow enemy to recruit extensively in Kentucky. We must also relieve morgan from his blockade at Cumberland Gap very soon or he may be started out. Enemy reported in strong force at Falmouth on road to this city.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Where is General Bragg? What do you know on the subject?

A. LINCOLN.

LOUISVILLE, KY., September 7, 1862.

President LINCOLN:

I do not know where General Bragg is, but believe he is in Tennessee threatening General Buell. I have taken letters from post-offices from some of his officers known to me saying he had an army of 35,000; that he would move on General Buell and drive him back. I have no doubt that he presses Buell's army. General Morgan reports that Kirby Smith is receiving re-enforcements through the mountains. Morgan had a successful skirmish with them the other day.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
