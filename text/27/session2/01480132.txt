timate an 1 peaceful intentions, offering no resistance, have been
arrested by a military force of Mexicans—a portion put to
death in the most perfidious manner, whilst others put in
ina cl^s, were, without any regard to the usages of war
ami gst civilized nations, or the universally received prmci
pl^a of humanity, having been first divested of then shoes and
c'o nng, and driven rather as beaststhan human beings from
tilt place of their capture to the cuy of Mexico, a distance of
n "t\y hundred miles, by a soldiery cruel, relentless, and unre
si*- mad, and when theie, their life, their death, or, what is
a ir^e than death, protracted bondage in chains, at the mere
of a military dictator, and to give a deeper interest, if pos-
bib j, for the fete of our unfortunate countrymen, the fact is
e j }o exist, that a citizen of Kentucky, a mere youth of se
Vv ¡tttien, is cue of the wretched captives And whereas protec
% na is due to all and every, the humblest citizen of the Repub*
lie, whether at home or abroad Therefore,
Resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth
„ of Kentucky^ That the Government of the United States owes
it to itself,.as well as to those unfortunate citizens, to use the
most prompt, vigorous, and efficient means to restore to liberty
<tnd their country tJjiose men, and to vindicate to Mexico and
the world the proud declaration that American citizenship is a
shield against wrong and oppression throughout the globe
Sett further resolved) That Kentucky will sustain, \n any
manner which shall be deemed necessary, with herí «11 strength,
the most energetic action of the General Government to right
the wrong, both individual and national
Resolved further, That, in the opinion of this Legislature,
it is the duty of the Government of the United States to demand
and require the Government of Mexico, in the future progress
of the war" with Texas, to observe the usages of civilized na
nona m the treatment of prisoners
Resolved further, That the Governor be requested to for
ward acopy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions to the
President of the United States, and to each of our Senators and
Representatives m Congress
On motion of Mr T^he said resolutions were referred to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and ordered to be printed
Mr THOMAS F MARSHALL said that a similar paper to
that presented by his colleague [Mr Thompson] had been for
warded to him (Mr M ) by the Executive of the State of Ken-
tucky, which he had received this morning He moved to re-
fer it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with instructions to
derive from the Department of State all information that
might exist there in relation to what had been done by that Be*
partment m relation to the subject and also such information
astheDepaitment might possess m relation to the captme
complained of, and that they report to this House, &e
Mi EVERETT suggested that the proper mode would be to
make a direct call—not to make the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs the organ of communication
Mr WOOD sail if this proposition was morder, he desired
to move an amendment, calling for a similai kind of informa
tion m relation to American State prisoners confined in Van
Dieman's tend
The SPEAKER said the instructions were in order, but that
if they gave rise to debate they must lie over
Mr. WOOD gave notice that he would offer his amend-
ment
Mr MARSHALL, on the "suggestion, he said, of Mr Tve
rett, would change the form of nis instructions, and offer the
proposition in the shape of a resolution calling on the Depart
ment for themformation indicated
Mr WOOD desired to know if his amendment would be in
order
The SPEAKER said that the resolution itself was not in Ol-
der except by general consent
No objection appeared to be made
Mr CUSHING suggested to Mr Marshall to make his mo
tion general, so as to include any information in the possession
of the Executive, and not to confine it to the  Department of
State
Mr MARSHALL said that was hia object
Mr ADAMS desired to know whether the Speaker had de-
cided that the motion of the gentleman from New Yoik [Mr
Wood] to amend the íesolution by extending the inquiry to the
case of the prisoners confined m Van Dieman's land, was not
m order
The SPEAKER said he had not so decided
Mr ADAMS said he understood the gentleman from New
York [Mr Wood] as making the motion
Mr WOOD said he intended to move his proposition as
an amendment to the resolution of the gentleman from Ken
tucky
The SPEAKER said the resolution had been received, but no
debate could be entertained
The resolution of Mr Marshall was then read as follows,
(it having been first modified on the suggestion of Mr
Adams, by inserting the usual proviso as to the compatibility
of the publication of theinfoimatiomeferredtu with the public
interests )
Resolved, That the President of the United States be re
quested to communicate to the House alt themfotmitien in his
possession, which may not be incompatible with the public in
terest, touching the American citizens captuied near Santa Te,
in Me-siro, and what steps, if aay, have been taken relative
thereto by this Government
Mr WOOD then moved to amend the said íesolution by ad
ding the following words
Also, any information he may have, and not incomDatible
with the publis interest, concerning American citizens now Bn
tish pusoners m Van Dieman's land
Mr LINN said that if the inquiry contemplated in the
amendment weie to be made, he had something to say on
the subject
The SPEAKER 1 f debate arises the whole subject must be
laid on the table
M\ ADAMS suggested to Mr Wood that the subject
embraced in his amendment had already betn íeferred to the
Committee on Foreign AiTaus Petitions and memorials on
that subject had been presented and referred to that committee
already
Mr WOOD said that in that event he should suppose that the
Committee on Foreign Affairs would wish to have befoie them
the very information contemplated m his amendment
Mr TURKEY moved the previous question
And there was a second
And the mam question (being on the resolution and amend-
ment) was ordered to be taken
■   i                                                                                                  --------
-'-y—-.....     '          ' '■—---------
j Aquestion of order here arose, Mr LINN insisting that the
previous question could not apply now, masmucnashehad,
previously to that motion being made, declared his desire to
apeak to the subject of the amendment
I The SPEAKER said, if such was the fact, and the gentleman
Insisted on his right to speak, the previous question would not
) After some conversation, Mr LlNNeaid that, as he was very
desirous that the inquiry contemplated in the resolution of the
gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Marshall] should be made, he
XMr L ^ was willing to waive his right to the floor
The question then recurred on the amendment.
Mr HABERSHAM called for the reading thereof, after
which,
Mr CRANSTON moved to lay the whole subject on the
table
Mr ANDREWS of Kentucky asked the yeas and nays on that
motion, which were refused
And the question being taken en the motion of Mr Crakstov,
at was decided m the negative
So the subject was not laid on the table
The question then recurred, and was taken on the amendment
of Mr Wood, and it was agreed to
And the resolution, as amended, was adopted.
Petitions and memorials weie further presented by—
Messrs ANDREWS, OWSLEY, GREEN, BUTLER, and
the SPEAKER, of Kentucky
THE BANKRLPT LAW
The SPEAKER piesented a petition of citizens of Richmond
county, Kentucky, praying the repeal of the Bankrupt law
Mr BRIGGS moved that the said petition be referred to the
Committee on the Judiuary, with instructions
*     "To report an amendment to the Bankrupt law passed at the
last session of Congress, by which all corporations which issue
paper to be circulated as money ahall be brought withm the
.  provisions of said law ;>
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi demanded the previous
question
Mr McKEON desired to be informed whether these mstruc
tions included all corpoi ations?
No answer, that the Reporter heard, but a good many cries to
order
Mr CAVE JOHNSON moved to lay the whole subject on
the table
Mr HOPKINS asked the yeas and nays on that motion, which
were ordered
Mr CLUTORD desired to be informed (so far as the Re
ported could understand the purportof theinquny)what would
be the effect of these instructions, if passed, on the instructions
given to ihe sime committee on a former day to report a bill
repealing the Bankrupt law
Mc GRANDER called Mr Clifford to older—submitting
to the Speaker that the question was not debatable
The SPEAKER so decided—remaiking that it would be time
enough for the Gruir to decide the eflectof the motion when the
question properly presented itself At present the question was
on the motion to lay the whole subject on the table
The roll of the yeas and nays was calle 1 through, and many
members changed their votes one way or the other'
Mr McKAY    Does the gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr
Bbiggs] intend these instructions as a repeal of the order of the
House repealing the Bankrupt law
[Loud cries to order ]
Mr WI&L submitted to the Speakei thai there had been eo
much misundei standing of the question, he hoped the Chair
would explain it
The Clerk, at the intimation of the Speaker, read the instruc-
tions
Mi  BRIGGS    Canlexphmi
[Cries of of "Yes, yes"—'explain"—"No, no," &x 3

So the House refused to lay the whole subject on the table
The question recuned on the demard of Mr Thompson, of
Mississippi   for the previous question
Mr CLIFFORD asked Mi Bbiggs to accept a modification
of the instructions which he (Mr C,) would send to the Chan,
and which was read for infoimation
This proposed modification consisted of a proviso that the ex
istmg order of the House, directed the Committee on the Judici
ary to report a bill repealing the bankrupt law, should not be
hereby r a>nsideied.
'  Mr   BRIGGS     My intention wa? to leave both questions
open but I will consent to add the following proviso
"Provided, That these instructions are not to interfere with
oi recmd the instructions heretofore given to said committee to
report a bill to repeal the said bankrupt law
Mr WISE would like to be miormed how it was possi-
ble for these instruction not to mterfeie They must inter-
fere

question, (by tellers, Messrs Ward and Boardman,) and the
vote-tood  Ayes84, noesSO
So there was a second
And on the question, "Shall the mam question be now

Mr  CAVE JOHNSON asked the yeas and nays
Mr FILLMORE ask^d Mr Bkigos so to modify his mstruc*
turns to ihe committee as to add ' and also to leport such other
amendments assaid committee may deem necessary to perfect
said act"
Mr BRIGGS accepted this as a modification of his own pro-
position
Mi PROFFIT would like any gentleman to inform him how
it ^ as possible to amend a law and repeal it too
[Laughter, and calls to order ]
Mr CAVE JOHNSON desired the Speaker to state whether,
as other matters had been introduced since the foimer vote oh
that motion, it would again be m oidei to move to lay the whole
subject on the table
The SPEAKER answered affirmatively
And Mr CAVE JOHNSON moved that the whole subject
