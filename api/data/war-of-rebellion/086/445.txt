SPECIAL FIELD ORDER.] HDQRS. ARMY OF THE BORDER,

The troops composing this command will move forward to-morrow morning half an hour after daylight, in precisely the same order as that observed this day.

By command of Major-General Curtis:

T. I. McKENNY,

Major and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

PRAIRIE GROVE, ARK., November 5, 1864-7 p.m.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Fayetteville, Ark.:

I camp here to-night. Fagan and his men with three cannon passed this way toward Cane Hill. Everybody says this is the fact, so there is no doubt about it. Freeman and others went toward Huntsville. I want Generals McNeil and Sanborn to know this, so they may not be misled; and I hope you will also correct the report about cannon firing in the direction of Cane Hill. The people here heard the cannon at Fayetteville, but nothing of cannon at or near Cane Hill.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Cassville, Mo., November 5, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BENTEEN,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade, in the Field:

The general commanding this division directs that you report at the earliest possible moment the amount of ammunition and subsistence stores you have on hand.

S. LEE DAVIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

[First indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to Major-General Curtis, with the information that the brigade I have the honor to command is not a portion of the forces of the Department of the Missouri, but a transient brigade stationed at Memphis. I also respectfully request that the brigade be considered an independent one, and that my orders come directly from Major-General Curtis.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. W. BENTEEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
