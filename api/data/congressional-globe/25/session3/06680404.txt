I care not for these aspeisions—they pass we as
the idle wind ,Much less have I l-egaided some
good, honest friends who have assisted to "damn me

provided I remain true to them, and then coun-

luid, lather have been fighting for thqm in the Flor-

to have been warring as I have upon this almost
overwhelming powei of corruption' Dangeis be-
set you ijn every path in this wai—dangeis of life
and limb, dangers to character, dangers jn fact to
your own vutue No man can oppose himself
to umveisal corruption here, without having all
his virtues tempted and toed as in afieiy funiace
My hope is in the majority of the next House of
Commons The emmie State has declared for the
people against the President
That now is the issue: shall the people or the
Biesident pievail ? The contest is no longer about
measures The sub-Treasury may be pioved to
6e the best system which the wisdom of man
eouM devise, but, su, the president and his min-
ions have .dared t© force it upon us, have ano-
ganily proclaimed it shall be the law, " notwith-
standing the lamentations here m elspwhcu '"
The mensuie has been thuoe reacted, it is tigatn
presented, and, if passed, will piove that the
President is too strong for the people In this
issue, I can no longer debute its policy oi expe-
diency. Another consideration is paiamount I
oppose it now because it u ran Executive mcaswe.
Prove It to be the best, I would hive my arm
chopped oft, my tongue pulled out, before 1 will
hefoiced to vote foi it by the will of one man I
■will not have "pudding itself stuffed down my

it last winter, now, I fuir, a much smalltr ma-
jority Some have gone over ' No wondei The
Piesident, notwithstanding the manifestations of
public sentiment, has all the odds against the
Íieople. He has one hundied thousand office-
lolders to do his bidding, stationed at every out-
post—spies, informéis—thioughout the country
He haa the press, he has the public money whue-
Tyith to pay " the bounty," unprotected by law,
in hands or pai tisana, placed wheie he pleases,
distributed as he pleases. lie has the public lands
This is the gieat souice of patronage and powei
Sir, how can State rights men suppoi t this mam-
moth ExecuXiye' How expect a large portion of
the S¡tates to be free and independent, and stand
upon their reserved lights against power consoli-

call upon alt the patriotic of this land to drop cur-
rency, banksjijnance— every minor consideration
and topic—and to devote themselves whollv to the
great work of resisting and reducing this'Dagon
Exepative—to come up to our help—to come soon,
or we will be powerless to resist' May an over-
ruling Providence prevent the reduction of our

to "fatigue vs into compliance," but if the "favor-

hpmbje results to this nation.   It will surely re-
elect him to s.jeconi term, and toAo mil succeed him ?
That is the last great question Let me tell cer-

moneys deposited, and whether the balances remaining are
part and paicel of the very monevs originally deposited
Ml RIVES said The resolutions just read,
Mr President, carry, in a great measure, their
purpose and intention on their face Still it may
be expected of me to state somewhat more in
detail the particulai views with which they are
offered, and the scope of the information they are
designed to elicit The first resolution, it will be
perceived, relates to the negotiations and trans
actions which have recently taken place between
the Treasury Pepartnlent and the Bank of the
United States, and is intended to ascertain the
precise relation which at present exists between
the Government and that institution. For sev-
eral months past rumors of an extraordinary char-
acter have prevailed, thai notwithstanding the
convulsions through which the country had
passed,, to put an end to the fiscal connection
formerly existing between this institution and the
Government, the Treasury Department had re-
cently entered into arrangements with it, which,
to a great extent, renewed that connection Ru-
mors of this sort could not fail to awaken a high
degree of anxiety, as well as surprise, in the pub-
lic mind When the " seven years' war " which
had been piosecuted by the party in power to put
down, and kedp down, this institution, was .rec-
ollected, when the constant and loud denuncia-
tions directed against it by the Administration
and its friends, were sttll ringing m the ears of the
people, they were slow to believe that so sudden
and extiaoidmary a change of position could have
taken place on the part of the Government
It was true that the Bank of the United States
now held its charter under the authority of the
State of Pennsylvania, arid not of the United
States But this circumstance, according to "the
declared opinions of the Administration áhd all
its presentproirunentsupporters, had notéhariged
the essential character of the institution or les-
sened its dangers to the country The head of the
Administration himself took an early occasion,
aftei the recharter of the bank by the State of
Pennsylvania, in a letter addressed to an assem-
blage of his fellow-citizens, called together to
celébrale "the emancipation of the Country from
the thraldom of the bank," to declare that this in-
stitution, undei its State charter, " was still the
same powei, fighting under the same panoply,
and only varying the manner of its approach "
The Senator from Pennsylvania, [Mr Bb-ghan-
av,] I need not say one of the most distinguished
champions of the Administration, had also ad-
dressed a letter to his fellow citizens, in which he
eloquently and foicibly dpnounced " the Bank of
the United States as recharte red by his own State."
He piortounced it to be " the very same monop-
oly which had heretofore convulsed the coun-
tiy, with the same capital of $35,000,000, owned
by the same stockholders, (except the United
States,) and guided by the same controlling will"
—"the same monster bank, recalled into exist-
ence by the Legislature of Pennsylvania, but with
poweisand privileges greater and more danger-
ous than those which had been conferred on it by
Congiess " The Senator from South Carolina,
[Mi Calhoun,] now a leading suppoi ter of the
financial policy, at least, of the Administration,
had also signalized his zeal in the same cause
We all recollect the alarm he manifested, both
during the extta session and the late annual ses-
sion of Congiess, lest this dreaded institution
should repossess itself of the Government depos-
its, and that he declared he should consider such
an event as one of the deepest disgraces, as well
as direst calamities, which could fall upon the
country It was but the other day we saw a pub-
lished letter of the Senator from Missouri, [Mr
Bekton,] in which, speaking of the present Bank
of the United States, he declares, in nis emphatic
phraseology, " we know it is more wicked, and
we have the authority of its president that it is
more powerful, than ever "
With these accumulated maledictions of the
Admimstiation and all its leading supporters on
the present as well as the former Bank of the
United States, after the solemn and constantly
repeated declarations of uncompromising hostility
to it, was hard to believe, without the most une-
quivocal proofs, that the Administration could
have entered into any connection with so de
nounced and dreaded an institution Notwith-
standing, therefore,the developments which, from
time to time.gavean increasing probability to the
rumors of this connection, the public mind was
still incredulous, and awaited with anxiety the
further disclosure of facts In this state of things,
Congiess assembled, and everybody looked with
confidence to the annual report of the Secretary
of the Treasury to clear up all mystery on a sub-
ject which had attracted so much of the public
attention, and which deeply concerned the char-
acter of the Government as well as the interests
of the people But, instead of information .there
seemed to be a studied reserve and ambiguity,
and almost total silence in the Secretary's report
on the whole subject. Although he had been
charged by anact of Congress with a special trust,
