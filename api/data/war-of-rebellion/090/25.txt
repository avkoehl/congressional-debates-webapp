early in the morning until 5 o'clock in the evening, completely defeated him, and, driving him through Winchester, captured about 2,500 prisoners, 5 pieces of artillery, 9 army flags, and most of their wounded. The rebel General Rodes and General Gordon were killed,* and three other general officer wounded. Most of the enemy's wounded and all their killed fell into our hands. Our losses are severe, among them General D. A. Russell, commanding division in the Sixth Corps, who was killed by a cannon-ball. Generals Upton, McIntosh, and Chapman are wounded. I cannot yet tell our losses. The conduct of the officers and men was most superb. They charged and carried every position taken up by the rebels from Opequon Creek to Winchester. The enemy were strong in number and very obstinate in their fighting. I desire to mention to the lieutenant-general commanding the army the gallant conduct of Generals Wright, Crook, Emory, Torbert, and the officers and men under their command; to them the country is indebted for this handsome victory. A more detailed report will be forwarded.

STRASBURG, September 20, 1864 - 9 p. m.

(Received 21st.)

I have the honor to report my command at Strasburg. My troops were so much fatigued by their work yesterday that I was only able to follow the enemy a short distance south of Winchester last night. My infantry marched form Winchester to Strasburg to-day. I could not get ready to attack the enemy before night. Early was badly whipped yesterday. I have not yet received full reports. The enemy left in Winchester over 3,000 wounded. We captured 5 pieces of artillery, a number of caissons, 4,000 stand of small-arms. My estimate of Early's loss yesterday is over 7,00. He lost the following general officers: Rodes and Godwin, killed; Gordon, wounded mortally; Terry, Hays, Fitz Lee, and Bradley Johnson, wounded. General Ramseur reported by citizens as wounded; this is doubtful. My casualties will be about 4,000; no accurate returns received. Colonel Duval, commanding division in Crook's army, was wounded. General Chapman was slightly wounded; he is now on duty.

In consequence of a report that I received from Averell that Early had marched two divisions of his command down to Martinsburg, I changed the programme that I spoke about when I saw you at Charlestown, and moved directly up the Berryville pike. The information that Early had marched two divisions to Martinsburg was incorrect, and I found his whole force, excepting Kershaw's division, which was at Front Royal, in my front. I then attempted, by swinging round

*A mistake as to Gordon. Reference is probably to General A. C. Godwin, who was killed.
