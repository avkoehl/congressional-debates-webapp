GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 13, 1864-9 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

We have just received word that the enemy's gun-boats have made their appearance on James River. Grant's left has reached the river at Wilcox's Wharf. Lee has undoubtedly anticipated Grant's move. The gun-boats coming down looks like a combined attack. General Butler thinks that we may be attacked to-night or in the morning.

Make the best disposition of forces you can.

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

Is it known to you whether the admiral has sunk the obstruction yet? I heard of one small gun-boat of the enemy at Dutch Gap this p.m., about 5 o'clock. She fired two shots at our lookout. She was a kind of tug-boat, and I attached no special importance to her movements. Have you heard of any other gun-boats?

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

The following communication is respectfully forwarded:
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, TENTH CORPS, In the Field, June 13, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: If an attack is expected I think that it would be unwise to send off 600 men from my command for fatigue at 3.30 o'clock to-morrow morning, that being just the time when an attack is most likely to take place. Will there be any change of orders in regard to it?

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 13, 1864.

General GILLMORE:

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel, &c.
