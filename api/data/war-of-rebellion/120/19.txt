Spies and guerrillas, murderers under the assumed title of Confederate soldiers, deserters on leave, should be hung quick, of course after a trial, for the number of escapes made easy by the changes on guard during the long time consumed by trial and reference have made that class of men bold and dangerous, and our own scouts and detachments have so little faith in the punishment of known desperadoes that a habit is growing of "losing prisoners in the swamp," the meaning of which you know. This horrible attendant of war originated in the which you know. This horrible attendant of war originated in the practice of our enemies, and I have seen it chuckled over in their public journals; but our own men are quick to learn, and unless a legal punishment can be devised you will soon be relieved of all such cases. I believe that the veriest demon should have a hearing and trial, but punishment should be prompt, yea speedy, or it loses its efficacy.

I believe the laws I have quoted give the commander of an army in the field lawful power to try by court-martial, approve and execute the sentence, and I believe the law to be right and humane to society. If wrong I should be corrected at once. Forty or fifty-executions now would in the next twelve months save a thousand lives.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major General B. F. BUTLER, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: it is represented that Captain M. S. Royce, of General Wheeler's cavalry, is now confined in the penitentiary at Nashville, Tenn.

Captain Royce is an officer in the Confederate service and is entitled to the treatment of a prisoner of war. It is alleged that he violated an oath of allegiance to the Federal Government. To this there are two replies: First. The oath was taken with an express limitation that it should not be binding if the Confederate forces occupied the country where he lived. Such was the fact when he joined those forces. Your own General Orders, Numbers 207, recognizes the doctrine that the oath was not obligatory upon him under those circumstances. Secondly. I think you will find he was absolved from his oath by the distinct agreements of the agents of exchange. I will thank you to make due inquiry into this matter and inform me what the Federal authorities propose to do with Captain Royce.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Major General B. F. BUTLER, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: The relatives and friends of Major Burroughs insist that he was most fully murdered. When I brought the matter to your notice you informed me that a military inquiry had been made in the case and that you would furnish me with a copy of the record. I will be obliged to you if you will transmit the record as early as possible.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
