HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, September 4, 1862.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Open communicate with General Gilbert, and ask him if he can hold his position until he can be re-enforce by Dumont's command and in the mean time of he can cover Frankfort with his cavalry force. It is of the highest importance to hold Frankfort if it can be done without too great risk of another defeat from the rawness of our troops. I have telegraphed to Commander Hull for guns for your boats to be sent from Saint Louis. Those here belong to this place and are already on boats. Have sent to Pittsburgh for ammunition to be consigned to you for those guns.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

I don't credit the report of attack on Gilbert. Your supporting him is all right, however. Ascertain truth, and if report is correct withdraw Dumont to Louisville; or, if not practicable, send them to Munfordville. I have had nearly a hundred stampeding reports to-day from reliable men and officers, none of which were true. Two thousand rebel cavalry turned out to be 20 Home Guards.

Brigadier General E. DUMONT, Lebanon, Ky.:

Don't move without your whole force, and hold on till you hear from me again. When can you be ready to move? The report in regard to Gillbert is incorrect.

General J. W. FINNELL,

Adjutant-General, Lexington, Ky.:

The officer in command at Louisville must so dispose his available force as to sustain the forces of Gillbert and Boyle, and the citizens should be called out by him or the Governor to aid in the defense of the place. Defenses in the way of rifle pits and log breastworks can be thrown up on the avenues of approach by a force to be drawn from citizens, black and white, and I will instruct him to this effect. I know of nothing more that can be done. I do not believe the enemy's force near Gillbert to be a large one. Troops are being hurried in as fast as possible. Should be glad to receive any suggestion you may have
