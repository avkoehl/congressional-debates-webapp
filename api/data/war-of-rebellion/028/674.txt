HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 21, 1862.

Major H. M. BELL, Acting Quartermaster. Staunton, Va.:

MAJOR: Your letter* of the 19th, inclosing copy of note from Major F. A. Briscoe, has been received. Major Briscoe misunderstood the orders of Colonel Corley. They referred only to such articles as were not required at Staunton. All the cloth that you can manufacture into clothing at Staunton for the army I desire you shall retain, and that you will use every effort to obtain cloth in Northern and Northwestern Virginia for that purpose. I have directed Colonel Imboden, in his operations in Hardy and Hampshire Counties, to collect all the leather that can be obtained in those counties and forward it toward Staunton. The difficulty with him is to obtain transportation, but I hope he will be able to transport it beyond the reach of the enemy, so that you may be able to secure it. Colonel Corley has corrected the misapprehension of Major Briscoe in reference to the forwarding of stores, &amp;c., from Staunton to Richmond.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.

Commanding Left Wing,&c.:

GENERAL: General R. E. Lee desires me to say that he deems it necessary that the Maryland troops should have a battery to render them
