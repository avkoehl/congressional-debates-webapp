In view of the above you will not move your command from near Sweet Springs until you can find out positively as to whether the report is correct or not, or if your command has moved, send back a sufficient force to prevent the enemy, if he be at New Castle, from making his escape over Sweet Springs Mountain. It is suggested that the force referred to is a part or the whole of the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry.
