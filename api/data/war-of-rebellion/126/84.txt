Bvt. Brigadier General D. C. McCALLUM,

General Manager U. S. Military Railroads:

GENERAL: As general superintendent of military railroads, Division of the Tennessee, I have the honor to submit the following report:

I succeeded Major E. L. Wentz as general superintendent military railroads, Military Division of the Mississippi in May, 1865. He that I am the third general superintendent who has had charge of operations in this department during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865. Not having access to all the annals of my predecessors in office, I shall find it almost impossible to make a report as minute and complete as is desirable.
