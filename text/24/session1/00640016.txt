THE CONGRESSIONAL <5LO§E.
December 8l
capital, the more appropriate inquiry under these
■ovcl circumstance*, and on an occasion like the
present, seems 10 be to discover the most judicious
course to pursue in ««ins: the surplus, and in
prev-entinsr or regulating its future accumulation.
The b^ance now on hand, or anticipated, does not
dirkr^o much in amount from that at se\eral
prior pt noils as to require any extraordinary
steps, if the same available mode existed, of em-
plovne it legally and beneficiallv, without new
féeislauon. Tbt re were three former years in our
historv, viz: 181.3, 1816, and 1817, when our bal-
ances on hand, on the 1st of January of each
year, were respmivelr over thirteen, twentv-
two, and fourteen millions of dollars, and in
1KÍ3, over eleven millions. But those balances
were either unavailable for a time, or, whenever
productive, were soon able to be applied in the
discharare of the public debt, and thus to prevent
longer and larger accumulations, and to save in-
terest. In that way, being reduced from time to
time, thevat no other period have ever exceeded
ten millions, though on four other occasions thev
have accumulated beyond nine millions. But,
happily for the country, it is no longer compelled
to part with us resources to discharge heavy bur-
dens imposed in former times, and in the present
prosperous state of our finances, it is lespectlbllv
•ubnutted that, in order to reduce the present
surplus, there might be first, and judicially au-
thorized, for purposes not enumerated in any of
the estimates, other beneficial expenditures for
ebjectt clearly lawful and useful. Not consider-
ing it the province of this Department, m an an-
nual report, to enter into minute details in relation
to the selection of those objects, the undersigned
would merely advert to a few prominent ones,
about which no constitutional difficulties inter-
pose: such as the erection of suitable and neces-
sary buildings for the use of the General Gov-
ernment, whether in this eity or the different
States, and the earlier commencement of import-
ant works contemplated, and the more rapid
completion of others already begun, which are
essentially connected with the commerce, the
Nat y, or the frontier defenses of the country.
Since the general estimates were closed, but,
appended to them in a note, various additional
improvements at the navy-yards afone, requiring
the appropriation of three and a half millions,
have been specified and submitted by the Jíavy
Department, and which, m its opinion, could be
now usefully undertaken. If so many works of
these descriptions should now be authorized or
hastened by Congress, as v. ere unquestionable
m their utility and character, and were likely to
to be sufficient to absorb the present and antici-
pated surplus of revenue in the Treasury from
ordinary sources, it i  hoped that, ere hong, addi- ,
tional receipts from our stock in the.'Bank of the
United States would probably be mote tnan svrffi-'
eient to insure their completion. But if the surplus
from all sources should hereafter, from any cause,
appear likely to become earlier exhausted, some
of those works could be suspended, or again, as
heretofore be less rapidly hastened. If it be not
deemed expedient, in this or any other manner,
now to appropriate all the present surplus, this
Department thinks that the most eligible course
concerning any probable residue, after deducting
all outstanding appropriations which may be
made, and enough to render our fiscal system effi-
cient, easy, and prompt, wcruldbe, that Congress
retain such residue under its control, and provide
for its investment for a short period as a provident
fund, to be ready to meet any contiligences attend-
ingtlre great reduction contemplated in ourre venue
hereafter; or, in the meantime, to strengthen our
financial position under the additional burden of
any large claims now pending, which Congress
may deem it just to allow, or at any future mo-
ment to aid under those inevitable and great fluc-
tuations in revenue and expenditure from which
no country is exempt, and which no human saga-
city can wholly prevent. For all such occur-
rences it ísoften economical, and especially in oar
present prosperous condition with surplus money
on hand, it is consistent with a wise foresight
and sound political prudence, tobe previously and
well guarded. WhatP ver demands on such a fund
may occur before 1842, it is certain, under our
existing laws, as-before explained, that the reve-
nue from customs must then, withinafew months,
be reduced in the large sum of nearly $6,000,000.
It is further probable that our whole revenue from
customs will, bv the close of that year, have fallen
to only $9,000,000; and fiom lands, (for public
uses.) have risen not to much above $4,000,000,
both making but $13,000,000, instead of their
present annual amount of oi er §20,000,000. For
that great and sudden change, it is very desirable
that the country should then be prepared by a
diminished expenditure, and a proper surplus on
hand to meet any probable deficiency, so as not
to require new or increased taxation to defray the
expenses then necessary. It may reasonably be
expected, that the revolutionary pension list will
by that time hate chiefly disappeared—the Indian
titles have been mostly extinguished—our neces-
sary and convenient public buildings throughout
the country mostly finisln d, and our fortifications
and Nav v> if the appropriations in the mean time
bo liberal, will ha\o betn placed in a proper atti-
tude to meet any hostile aggressions without the
continuance of extraordinary appropriations.
By this system, evincing a just and far-sighted
liberality in giants to objects clearly national and
necessary, and pursuing a course of rigid econ-
omy and due retrenchment, where the great inter-
ests of the Union will peinnt, our expenses,
though they must from our rapidly extending
population, business, and frontier, increase in
some particulars in nearly a corresponding ratio,
and may not, as a. whole, become reduced exactly
to the amount of revenue received, yet they
will, if no unforeseen calamities occur, so nearly
approach it, that a surplus of a few millions,
duly invested and retained, would doubtless
obviate the necessity of a resort then, or soon
after, to more taxes The investment of this, or
any other surplus not soon wanted, could be ef-
fected till wanted in any mode most agreeable to
Congress, in whom the whole power on this sub-
ject resides, and without whose express authority
nothing can be taken from the Treasury for any
purpose whatever. But, as it may not be deemed
necessary or expedient soon to resort to any such
investment, an explanation at this time of the dif-
ferent modes in which it might be accomplished,
with the opinion of the Department on their pe-
culiar merits and dements, would perhaps be con-
sidered useless; and consequently only two gen-
eral principles will now be proposed, which are
respectfully suggested, as proper to have a ma-
terial bearing on the whole subject. First, that
whatever mode may be adopted, it should con-
form to the spirit of the act of March, 1817,
which has been in successful operation ever since
the surplus became likely to be large ami fre-
quent; and which requirefl, before the investment
of them in purchase or extinguishment of the
public debt, that enough should be left in the
Treasury to meet all outstanding appropriations,
and two millions more to secure facility and
promptitude in its various and distant operations.
And, secondly, that following the analogy of the
above act, which separated the investment of
any surplus for pecuniary profit entirely from
the management of the public deposits and the
duties of deposit banks, it should leave the bank
agents of the Treasury as they and all its other
fiscal agents, from the foundation of the Govern-
ment, have been left wholly disconnected, so far
as practicable, in regard to their agencies, with
the dangerous relation of borrowers from the
Treasury, for reloaning and for private gam.
Should either of the above courses not be deemed
advisable, so fur as to exhaust all the unneces-
sary surplus on hand, the residue, if not large,
could be gradually disposed of by making a fur-
ther reduction, whenever just and safe, in the
revenue hereafter accruing from customs.
To obtain the balance estimated to exist in
the Treasury at the end of 1836, the sum of
$15,000,000 is computed to be received from that
source, and chiefly to accrue in the ensuing year;
and if a part of it should be considered not de-
sirable for any purposes whatever, it could be much
and perhaps usefully lessened, by an early dimi-
nution of the existing duties on certain articles
not supposed to be vitally connected with our
domestic manufactures. The most prominent of
these articles are wines and silks from beyond
the Cape of Good Hope.   They both yield, in
duties, over half a million per annum; or in 1834,
wines, over four hundred and forty-five thousand
dollars, and India silks, over one hundred and
sevonty-one thousand dollars, all of which might
well be repeakd.unlessCongressshould consider
the former a judicious tax on a luxury, and the
latter as an encouragement to the domestic pro-
duct of silk, which is becoming widely and suc-
cessfully established; and which, if deemed a
proper object of incidental protection by legisla-
tion, (contrary to the views lately entertained by
Congress,) would require a restoration of the
duty on European silks now entirely flee. Other
articles could be selected, on which the present
duties could be reduced and repealed, at least to
the extent of $400,000 annually, without injuring,
it is anticipated, any domestic manufactures or
agricultural branch of industry, or impairing the
spirit and good faith of the compromise intended
by the act of Congress of March 3, 1833, and
which the undersigned would most scrupulously
preserve unviolated. On this subject, a detailed
report will soon be presented to the Senate, m
conformity to a resolution of that body passed
at the last session. It is his deliberate opinion,
that such of those reductions as are deemed per-
missible under the above limitations should now
be made; and the balance remaining, if too great
for common fiscal purposes, be temporarily and
profitably invested, rather than a large surplus
should continue to be collected for the express
end of being, in any way, finally disposed of,
otherwise than by appropriations to useful and
constitutional objects.
The people, themselves, it is believed, can best
manage all their own money, which they and
their representatives think may not be wanted
for public purposes, and it would seem to be far
preferable to leave it originally in their posses-
sion, than to withdraw it for the expensive oper-
ation of returning it substantially to the place
whence it came, and that, probably, in a manner
not conformable to the Constitution, till after the
delay of procuring an amendment to it, and even
then, not expedient, because calculated, injudi-
ciously, to strengthen the General Government,
and to render the States more dependent on a great
central power for yearly and important resources.
Indeed, a reduction in the price of public lands,
whose unusually large sales the past year are the
source of most of the present surplus, would, if
their sales should not thereby be much increased,
seem another iftode far more natural to obviate
the present difficulty. But before adopting it,
th  and various other considerations must be
weighed, and it must be fully considered, whether
all the revenue anticipated from them at their
present prices would not be necessary after the
great reductions in the tariff" in 1842, and whether
a resort to a higher tariff would not then become
indispensable, if the average receipts from lands
or customs should, from any new legislation, be*
come then much diminished below the estimates
which have been submitted on the present occa-
sion.
VI. Deposit Banks and the Currency.
This Department takes pleasure in stating that
the public money continues to be collected and
deposited, under the present system of selected
banks, with groat ease and economy in all cases 
and with greater in some, than at any former
period. The transfers of it to every quarter of
the country where it is needed for disbursement
have never been effected with more promptitude,
and have been made entirely free of expense to
the Treasury. The payments to creditors, offi-
cers, and pensioners have been punctual and con-
venient, and the whole fiscal operations through
the State banks have as yet proved highly satis-
factory. Incidental to this, the facilities that have
been furnished to the commercial community in
domestic exchanges were probably never greater ,
or at so moderate rates. In the course of this
year, additional depositories have been selected
in four States where no new ones before existed,
and all the branches of the United State  Rank
for some months have been discontinued for
ordinary fiscal purposes. They are, however,
still used, as claimed by the bank, under acts of
Congress, for the payment of the outstanding
portions of the funded debt, and of invalid and
other pensions, prior to 1832, except where the
