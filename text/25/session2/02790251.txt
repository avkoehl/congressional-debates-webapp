CIVIL LIST BILL
The House again resolved itself into Cemmittee

The qwstion pending was the motion of Mr
Halsteid to strike out the item of §4,000 for the
¡el d'eau, on the south side of the centre foot-way
in front of the Capitol.
Mr HALSTEAD, who was entitled to the floor,
replied at some length to the remarks make on yes-
terday by Mr  Lincoln
Mr BOON said that it was not his intention to
folloiv the member from New Jersey [Mr Hal-
stead] through the whole of his made which he
pouied forth yesterday against the late and piesent
Administrations of the people's own choosing. He
had listened attentively to the gentleman's ha-
l angue, and he must say, that he had not supposed
that fheie was a human being to be found upon the
face of the  eaith, who could, m the space of two
hours, have detailed or brought to view so great a
nuinbsr of gross absurdities and undignified allu-
sions, as were summed up in the gentleman's
speech on yesterday. Nor was he ever before so
sensible of tne advantages of being "weli-born,"
and "college bred " This was very strikingly
exhibited in the gentleman's illustration of what
constituted a dandy That gentleman, m the true
chaiacter of the revengeful adder, whose poison is
under his tongue, commenced his attack upon the
Administration by making invidious compansans
He « as pleased to call the friends of the Adminis-
tration Fa  Jacks, and the Administration itself he
very modestly and respectfully (according to his
vocabulary of learning) pronounced to be a dandy
Administration A dandy, he said, generally wore
cor&els and dickeys, and went m debt more than it
was able to pay Such, he said, was the true cha-
iacter of the present Administration The Presi-
dent and Vice President, he said, one or both of
them, wore corsets and dickeys, but he did not
know whether they were black oi white Dickeys,
the gentleman had said, bore a very close affinity
to ilaih.es or blackies, and he had added much more
of the like disgraceful slang
The member from New Jersey made quite a
display about the increase of public expenditure
in the way of stationery and public printing, and
introduced items to show that the heads of Depart-
ments had been furnished with a certain amount
foi newspapers, and, among others, had particu-
larly dwelt upon one called the Turf Register But
the gentleman took especial care not to say any
thing about the sum of public money that had been
expended for his particular benefit, by way of
books, newspapers, paper, pens, wafers, sealing
wat, etc He [Mr B ] should like to know how
much stationery had been consumed by the mem-
ber from New Jersey, in enclrasmg bank Whig
speeches, and other Opposition stud of like charac-
ter
If the numbei of public documents have been
increased d i ring the late and present Administra-
tions, to what party is that item of public expen-
diture to be charged1 Surely not to the Adminis-
tration party, for it will be found that in nineteen
ceses out of twenty, where calls have been made,
calculated to swell the amount for printing and for
paper, it has been by calls made by the Opposition
To have heard the gentleman's harangue, one
would have supposed the gentleman to be one of
the greatest economists of the age, but on looking
acioss the hall, he discovered the gentleman stand-
ing behind a larger pile of public documents, than
he had seen on the table of any member at
the present session of Congress, while he was
addressing the House
But it was useless tor him to say more in reply
to one who (to use a backwoods phrase) had been
literally uusedupv by a distinguished "íf/«g" gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Lincoln ] In
the whole Whig ranks in that House, there had, as
yet, been but one solitary individual—that is the
honoiable member from the Nashville district, in
the State of Tennessee—who could muster moral
courage enough to thank the gentleman from New
Jersey for his wholesale denunciation of the Ad-
ministration
It seemed to him that the gentleman from New
Jersey started upon a wrong scent, and that the
greater part oí what he intended to be prejudicial
to others, was applicable to himself also The
gentleman declared m the outset of his speech, that
this Administration was a dandy Administration.
Now, Mr B considered that this came with
rather a bad grace fiom the gentleman from New
Jersey, for if he had been called upon to point out
one of the members of the House who, above all
others, wore the most daniij/-like appearance, he
should have, unhesitatingly, pointed to the member
from New Jersey. Who would suspect a gentle-
man of-talking about dandies who had to get on a
stump to look over his cravat, or take off his coat
to get his fingers in the pockets of his \ est Why,
sir, it is sublimely ridiculous Mr B believ-
ed theie *ould, at all times, be found in
this codiitry political demagogues who will
be continually finding fault, and with such
persons the gentleman might be classed    In fact,
