IilGIIT OF SUFFRAGE.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I ask
unanimous consent to have taken from the
Speaker's table and referred to the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary, Senate bill No. 793, to
amend an act to enforce the rights of citizens
of the United States to vote in the several
States of this Union, and for other purposes.
Mr.'RANDALL. I object.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I simply
ask to have it referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Mr. RANDALL. I know; and then the
committee would have the right to report it
to the House for action.
JOHN E. HANKS.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent, laid
before the House the following message from
the President of the United States:
To the Bouse of Representatives:
I herewith return for the farther consideration of
Congress, without my approval, House bill No. 1550,
an act for tbo relief of the estate of Dr. John
Hanks, for the reason that the records of the Treas-
ury Department show ttiat the current moneys taken
by Colonel S. B. llolahird from the Louisiana State
Bank of New Orleans, in the month of August, 1802,
were accounted tor by that officer to the Treasury
Department, and the names of tne depositors given,
and that the name of Dr. John F. Hanks does not
appear among them.
It also appears from the records of the Treasury
Department that among the effects taken from the
Louisiana State Bank of New Orleans was the sum
of $1,729 of confederate money, and tbat the said
sum stood upon the books of said bank to the credit
of J. F. Hanks. It is but justice, however, to the
executors of the estate of JDr. Hanks to state that
there is every reason to beiieve that the money de-
posited by Dr. Hanks in tho Louisiana State Bank
was m current funds, and that when application
was made to Congress for the recovery of the same
they believed and had evidence to satisfy them that
such funds had found their way into tho Treasury
of the United States. There has unquestionably
bsen a mistake made, either by the officers of tho
Louisiana State Bank or the persons engaged in
removing the funds of that bank, by which the estate
of Dr. Hanks is loser to the amount of relief afforded
by House bill No. 1350. .
Accompanying this I send the statement lurnisiieel
by the Secretary of the Treasury of the funds cov-
ered into his Department, and accounted for through
it arising from the seizure of funds ofthe Louisiana
State Bank of New Orleans, in the month of August,
jg62. U. S. OrKAJNX.
Executive Maxsion, March 28,1872.
The SPEAKER. Accompanying this mes-
sage there is a communication from the Treas-
ury Department. If there be no objection,
the message and accompanying communica-
tion will be ordered to be printed, and will be
referred to the Committee of Claims, with the
right to reportatany time, as, being an Exec-
utive veto, it is somewhat in the nature of a
privileged matter. _ .
There was no objection, and it was ordered
accordingly.
