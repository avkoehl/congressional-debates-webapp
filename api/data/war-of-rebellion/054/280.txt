GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE OHIO,

No. 33. In the Field, November 30, 1863.

The brilliant events of the 29th instant, so successful to our arms, seem to present a fitting occasion for the commanding general to thank this army for their conduct through the severe experience of the past seventeen days, to assure them of the important bearing it has had on the campaign in the West, and to give them the news of the great victory gained by General Grant, toward which their fortitude and their bravery have in a high degree contributed.

In every fight in which they have been engaged, and recently in those near Knoxville, at Loudon, at Campbell's Station, and finally around the defenses on both sides of the river, while on the march, and in cold and in hunger, they have everywhere shown a spirit which has given to the Army of the Ohio a name second to none.

By holding in check a powerful body of the enemy, they have seriously weakened the rebel army under Bragg, which has been completely defeated by General Grant, and at the latest accounts was in full retreat for Dalton, closely pursued by him, with the loss of 6,000 prisoners, 52 pieces of artillery, and 12 stand of colors.

For this great and practical result, toward which the Army of the Ohio has done so much, the commanding general congratulates them, and with the fullest reliance on their patience and courage in the dangers they may yet have to meet, looks forward with confidence, under the blessing of Almighty God, to a successful close of the campaign.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE OHIO,

No. 34. In the Field, December 5, 1863.

The commanding general congratulates the troops on the raising of the siege. With unsurpassed fortitude and patient watchfulness they have sustained the wearing duties of the defense, and, with unyielding courage, they have repulsed the most desperate assaults. The army of the Ohio has nobly guarded the loyal region it redeemed from its oppressors, and has rendered the heroic defense of Knoxville memorable in the annals of the war. Strengthened by the experiences and the successes of the past, they now, with the powerful support of the gallant army which has come to their relief, and with undoubting faith in the divine protection, enter with the brightest prospects upon the closing scenes of a most brilliant campaign.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

LEWIS RICHMOND,
