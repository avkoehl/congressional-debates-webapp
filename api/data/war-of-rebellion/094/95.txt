Brigadier-General MEAGHER:

I have just received the following telegram:

RINGGOLD, December 7, 1864.

I have just learned Wharton's brigade of cavalry are three miles northeast of Parker's Gap, en route for this place. The information is creditable and from good authority.

Major JOHN W. SKILES,

Tod Barracks, Columbus, Ohio:

Where is the organized bank that is to attempt to burn the bridges on the Little Miami Railroad, or any part of them? If there are any such men in this department the general wants to know it and where they can be found. Answer.

C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 7, 1864.

Captain C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The superintended of the Columbus and Piqua Railroad applied to me yesterday evening for a guard to send to one of their important bridges, saying that Mr. clement, superintended of Little Miami Railroad, had informed the railroad authorities here that this band organized for the destruction of bridges on all the roads in Ohio; he did not give any other information. I presume Mr. Clement can give all the facts. The statement I sent by mail yesterday of what was going on here may have something to do with this.

JOHN W. SKILLES,

Major and Provost Marshall, City of Columbus.
