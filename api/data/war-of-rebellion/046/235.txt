Graef, Volunteer Engineers, made a covered way from the mortar batteries, in the rear of the first parallel, to the first parallel, and then extended it to the rear some distance, to include the Beacon House. the same day the roads to Black Island and the Marsh Battery, which had previously been built, were strengthened and widened by a working party under Captain S.
