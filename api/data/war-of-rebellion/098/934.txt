Tuesday, March 14. - Move at 6 o'clock in the morning for Kinston. Meet no opposition until we reach the bridge, where we find a cavalry picket, which soon retires, and the small force of cavalry which was in town retreats. The bridge si found to be burned, and we encamp on the south side of the river, waiting for the pontoon train. The town is about half a mile back from the river, and its three spires look very pretty, rising among the evergreen trees.

Wednesday, March 15. - The pontoon bridge is not laid until about 5 o'clock this afternoon, when my command marches over first. I ride out, with the escort, on the Snow Hill road about a mile and a half. Find a bench or upper bottom with plateau above, which is about thirty feet higher than the level of the valley in which the town is, and which would be an admirable military position, facing this way; but it is so far away from the landing and has so Little advantage against an enemy coming toward us that we concluded to encamp the troops just around the village, facing outward. A very heavy thunder-storm comes up as I am putting the troops into position, and I get damp before I can get to shelter. Carter's division is on the left, Ruger's in the center, and Palmer's on the right. The town is rather a pleasant one, and had originally about 1,000 inhabitants.

Thursday, March 16. - General Schofield heard from Sherman that he is at Fayetteville and will be at Goldsborough on the 20th or thereabouts. Rebel deserters coming in say that the enemy has fallen back from Goldsborough to Smithfield, on the Raleigh road, and that nothing but a Little cavalry is now at Goldsborough. We are pushing for ward the railroad as fast as possible, having 2,000 men from the command cutting and hauling ties, &amp;c. With our few wagons it is almost impossible to keep our men in food. The country here is a better one than that which we have seen in coming from New Berne, and foraging parties get some provisions.

Saturday, March 18. - The steam-boats which were ordered up from New Berne four days ago arrived to-day about noon, bringing us 100,000 rations. Under these circumstances it is probable that we shall move soon for Goldsborough. Orders are issued to be ready to move in the morning.

Sunday, March 19. - No move to-day; waiting for more supplies and to hear something from Sherman. Nearly all the afternoon we hear a rapid firing of cannon in the distance, and have no doubt he is fighting a battle with Johnston near Smithfield, toward Raleigh.

Monday, March 20. - March at 6 o'clock in the morning, reaching Rockford, on the Neuse, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, encamping there for the night. Report from rebel citizens that dispatches were received at Goldsborough last night saying that Sherman was whipped in the fight yesterday. We suspect that his advance guard may have received a rap, but know the strength of his army too well to believe that Johnston can whip him. The battle is said to have been near Bentonville. Nothing but cavalry is said to be in Goldsborough. Order of march to-day: Ruger in front, Carter in the center, and Greene (who temporarily takes Palmer's place) in the rear. General Greene is on his way to report to General Slocum, in Sherman's Army, and has been with me since we reached Gum Swamp. Had his horse shot under him as he sat beside me on the 10th and acted as volunteer aide. He is an old West Point officer, having graduated in 1828* (the year I was born), and having been out of service for a long time until the

*Greene was graduated in 1823.
