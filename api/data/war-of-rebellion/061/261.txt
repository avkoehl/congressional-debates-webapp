Franklin's command

a Wounded April 8.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES WESTERN LOUISIANA,Grand Ecore, April 18, 1864.

MAJOR: In mentioning the officers of my staff who were wounded in the battle of the 8th instant, I inadvertently neglected Captain Pigman, signal officer on my staff. This officer distinguished himself by his gallantry in the first part of the fight, and was severely wounded at the point where General Emory's division repulsed the enemy in his final attack.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major G. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
