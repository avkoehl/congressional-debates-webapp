THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 20,
of dollars deficiency in the treasury anticipated by
the Secretary. And as embodying his views on
the subject, he caused to be read the following
amendment, which he gave notice he should offer
at the prtfper time to the bill before the committee:
Be it furtker enacted, That from and after tlie passage of
this act, there shall be lu\ied and collected, m such manner
as may hp proscribed bv tlic feecret'ii^ o£ the ^Irca^ury of
the United States, the following rates of impost or per cent,
upon all capital as liereniaftei enumerated—that is to s-ay,
upon all bank stock or the capital of banks, whether the
same be incorporated or banking under a general banking
law. one per cent, per annum upon the stock so held 01 rlie
capital so invented ; upon all capital vested in bonds issued
by tlie several States which they are now paying the inter-
est on as it falls due, or bonds issued by the Government of
the United States, one per cent, per annum ; upon all capital
used or employed by any individual or individuals, bank or
batiks, bodies politic or corporate, in bujing, discounting, or
shaving notes, either pronnssoiy 01 bar.k paper, one per
cent, per annum ; upon alt money loaned beaimg mtore.-t, if
tnr sum so loaned exceed ten thousand dollars-, one per
cent, per annum; upon till capital exceeding Iifty thousand
dollais ve-ted m any one manufacturing establishment, one
half of one per cent. pijr annum; upon all gild und silver
plate or ware exceeding fifty dollars in value, ten per cent.
ad valorem.
He proposed by this amendment to legislate
upon the principle that the burdens of the Govern-
ment should be upon the rich, who ought to bear
them, and not upon the poor—upon the principle
that, carried out, would produce the greatest good
to the greatest number. He submitted this propo-
sition to the consideration of Congress before they
proceeded to levy a tax upon tea and coli'ee for the
purpose of raising something like two millions of
dollars. It was true, a very curious distinction
had been made by the gentleman from Georgia,
[Mr. Jones,] between articles of convenience and
necessaries. Now, if they were to confine the whole
people of the United Stales to what were .strictly
necessaries, the whole population could live on
bread and water, and everything else would be con-
sidered a comfort and a convenience. This was a
theory to which he was opposed; and by his vote
he should never be found to countcnance such a
system.
He laid down as a fundamental principle that the
expenses of this Government, and particularly
those incurred in time of war, should be sustained
by that portion of tlie population who enjoy the
greatest amount of protection. One of the great
ends of government was to acquire a power to pro-
tect the property of the citizens of the country; and
in war this power was physical power, which was
exerted to defend the property of the Citizens of the
country; and hence, when the expenses of a war
were to be incurred, they should be borne by tho.se
who receive the greatest protection from that war.
In this view of the subject, the impolicy and the
injustice of taxing the poor man's tea and cotiec to
carry on a war winch was mainly for the protection
of the property of the rich, was clearly seen. The
rich man, to be sure, used tea and coifee, and per-
haps a little more than the poor man; but there
were one hundred poor men to one rich man. One
hundred times as much, then, would be paid by
poor men as by the rich if we were to tax those
necessaries of life, tea and coffee, to carry on the
war. The burdens of taxation (Mr. J. boldly pro
claimed) should be shifted off the shoulders of the
poor, who had too long borne an undue and exor-
bitant proportion of them, and should be put upon
the wealth of the country.
Mr. JONES inquired if the gentleman did not
believe that the laboring classes in his portion of
the country would be willing to have a portion of
the taxes taken off of cotton, salt, iron, cotton bag-
ging, and put upon another necessary of lite—tea
and coffee ?
Mr. JOHNSON. No; I do not imagine any
such thing.
Let the gentleman from Georgia (continued Mr.
J.) imagine that he was before his constituents
making a speech on the finances of the country—
with the good old ladies, as well as their husbands
and sons, all around him, and let him ask them,
" Shall we put a tax on bank paper, gold and silver
plate, &c., or upon your tea and coffee, to defray
the expenses of the Mexican war?" and what did
the gentleman believe would be the reply?
Mr. JONES again interposed, and stated that he
was not opposed to the gentleman's amendment;
but he said the old ladies and the people of his dis-
trict would feel it far otherwise than a burden to
reduce the heavy duties on sugar, salt, iron, and
various other necessaries of life, and have pome
t|tx on tea and coffee, because, while they use r
portion of the latter articles, they do not use one-
twentieth of them that they do of the others upon
which he (Mr. Jones) desired, according to the
provisions of this bill, to reduce the duties.
Mr. JOHNSON repeated that the duty upon tea
and coffee was paid by from one to five hundred
poor men to one rich man. There were many
more of the poor than of the rich who pay it.
Mr. JONES. And each one of them has tlie pa-
triotism to pay it when it comes to war.
Mr. JOHNSON said the poor mechanic or la-
borer who earns some $500, $600, or $700 a year,
consumes as much tea and coffee in his family as
the man who is making his $G,000, $7,000, or $8,000
a year. The gentleman would not controvert but
it was a tax on the poor to defend the property and
wealth of those who call themselves rich—the aris-
tocracy of the country.
Mr. JONES (Mr. J. again yielding) said the
other articles which he had mentioned were equally
necessaries of life as tea and coffee; until, then,
we could take the duties off entirely from necessa-
ries, we must select some in the emergency of war,
and the tax would be more lightly felt on' tea and
coffee, of which much less quantities were used.
Mr. JOHNSON. If the gentleman will go
along with me, we will not only take them off of
salt, sugar, &c., but of tea and coffee, and place
them upon the capital of the rich used iu shaving,
invested in State stocks, bank stocks, plate, &c.
He might not he entirely correct in all his esti-
mates of the amount of revenue that his amend-
ment would raise; and he should, did opportunity
again offer, present it in a more exact form. He
could say, however, that its principle would en-
able the Government to raise sufiicient revenue by
taxing the articles of the wealthy which were to
be protected by this war, and exempting those of
the poor. The obvious justice and propriety of
this policy being further warmly enforced, Mr. J.
proceeded to make as near an estimate as he could
arrive at of the probable revenue which would be
raised undent, the results of which are embodied
in the following table or statement;
Estimated amount Revenue
in the coimtrif. from it.
Banking capital $3.24,000,OUi)
One per cent on this amount  $3,240,000
Bonds issued by the States and
the United States  100,000,000
One per cent, on this account  ] ,000,000
Money employed in shaving notes,
  100,000,000
One per cent. 011 the hame  1,000,000
Money loaned and bearing inter-
est  100,000,000
One pei cent, on the amount  1,000,000
Capital vested 111 niamilaclurcs.. 50,000,000
One-half of one per cent, on the
same  250,000
Gold and silver waie  100,000,000
Ten per cent, on tiie same, ad
valorem  10,000,000
$774,000,000 $16,490,000
Tins amount doubled would be a light tax,
winch would make  $32,980,000
It appears from the very highest authority, that
the amount of precious metals used for purposes
besides a circulating medium, is from $3,320,000,000
to $4,500,000,000.
The highest estimate of circulating medium in
the precious metals is 01,824,000,000. So it will
be seen that the amount used for purposes other
than a circulating medium is much greater.
Mr. J. appealed to every man on this floor, "Whig
or Democrat, who was a friend of the poor man,
and of adopting such legislation as would result in
the greatest good to the greatest number, if this
was not a more equitable basis of taxation than that
presented to them in the bill under consideration.
The revenue of the Government had long enough
been collected from the back and stomach of the poor
man; and if the great mass of the people could come
to understand this subject, they would say, let the
expenses of the Government, especially in time of
war, be paid by those who need the protection; let
them not fall upon those who endure the hardships,
and fight the battles of the country,and the wealthy
man be exempted, who sits at home behind his
bank counter, and realizes his hundreds and thou-
sands from speculating, stockjobbing, and shaving,
while all other portions of the community are suf-
ferers.
Mr. J. proceeded to reply to the remarks of Mr.
Collamer on a former occasion, and to show the
fallacy of his argument in behalf -of a protective
tariff, derived from the fact that those articles which
were highly taxed had fallen in price. He denied
that this fall was the result of the protective tariff,
and pointed to other articles, not taxed, which had
fallen in an equal or greater ratio.
In reply, also, to Mr. C.'sargujneixtin behalf of
a protective tariff, on the ground of the home mar-
ket furnished by it, and to show the insufficiency
of the said market, Mr. J. read the fallowing ex-
tract from a speech delivered by him on a former
occasion:
. RECAPITULATION
Of the amount of protection paid upon sundi*y articles«
To the manufacturers of cotton goods $23,000,000
" « woollen goods  10,500,000
Iron made  18,155,100
" " suggrmade   3,875,000
" " salt made  1,049,706
Grand total " 56.579,P06
This protection is first paid .by the merchant, and-becomes
a part of the first cost of his goods; upon this amount he
lays at least fifty per cent, profit, winch must be all paid by
the farmers and mechanics of the country, which is, in all,
the small sum of (profit to the merchant)  ^28,000,000
The amount brought down ,   56,000,000
Grand total...;  84,000,000
Upon all other articles, such as nails, leather, axes, chai ns,
hate, ready-made clo'lima, shoes, boots, scythes, sickles,
blacksmiths' tools, saddlery, cotton, yam,spades, and shov-
els, &c., vvlncli will average something like 50 per cent, ad
valorem, might be safely put down at $16,000,000
50 percent, for collecting, as above stated  8,000,000
Tlie amount of protection and foes for collecting 24,000,000
The whole amount brought down  84,000,000
The grand total  108,000,000
"  
This is the amount it costs the farmers in general, and the
mechanics in the small villages, who do business in a small
wav, to get the proposed $38,000,000 into the treasury of the
United Slates.
But we are told that these large manufacturing establish-
ments must be protected, and kept up, for the puipo^e of
giving the agriculturists a homo maiket for their surplus
produce. If the committee will give me their attention for
a shoit time, I wjll show the utter fallaey of this argument.
The whole number of persons -employed in manufacturing
in 1839 was about 775,000; m the same year there was raised
in the United States:
Bushels.
Corn  377,531,874
Wheat  84,823.272
Rye ;  18,645^567
 481,000,713
Allowing eighteen bushels of breadstufts to be
consumed by each individual employed in
manufacturing, and it will not amount to 14?-
000,000 of bushels; but I will put it down at
that  14.000,000
And it leaves. 1 467,000,713
Not a drop out of the bucket, and would not be missed by
the farmcis if they did not know it.
The number of neat cattle  14,971.586
The number of hogs  26,301,293
 4J ,272,879
Allow two hogs and one beef to sup-
poit every six persons employed m
the eastern manufacturing establish- ^
ments in the United States, and it
would take of beef cattle  120,302
Hogs     258,604
  387,906
Deduct this number from the 41,272,879, and it
leaves  40,884,973
We have now ascertained the quantity of meat and bread
consumed by this home market. The next inquiry is, what
docs it amount to in dollars and cente ?
The corn, wheat, and rye might be averaged at fifty cents
a bushel, which would make the 14,000,000 of bushels con-
sumed worth—
$7,000,000
The cattle *.  1.220.b2f>
Hogs  1^991,666
The whole amount of meat and bread........... 9,512,49-2
This is the whole amount paid by tlie manufac-
turing establishments to the farmers for the amount
of bread and meat they consume. Mr. J. said
it would be remembered by the committee that he
had shown, by the operation of the present tariff,
that it costs the people of this Government $108,-
000,000 protection and collection fees to get the
proposed $36,000,000 into the treasury of the Uni-
ted States. In the first place, the people paid
§108,000,000 into the pockets of collectors and
manufacturers, as they say, to build up a home
market. Then the manufacturer gives back to
the farmers, for bread and meat, $9,512,492 of the
$108,000,000 that had been taken off of then), in the
first place, in the way of price for their bread and
meat; or, m other words, paying the farmer out of
; his own money, retaining the balance of the §108,-
