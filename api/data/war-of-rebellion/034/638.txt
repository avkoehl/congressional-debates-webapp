All the prisoners (2,500), with Basil [W.] Duke, are at and near Pomeroy, and are expected here to-morrow. About 200 of Morgan's men were killed and drowned in their efforts to cross the Ohio at Buffington.

CHESHIRE, OHIO, July 21, 1863.

COLONEL: I am at this place with my command and about 1,000 prisoners. The command will remain here for a few days to collect up the stragglers. I want transports sent here to convey the prisoners off; also send rations. I start with 1,000 picked men after John [H.] Morgan, who is said to be close by with a squad of men. Send transports for all my men.

HEADQUARTERS TWELVE MILES FROM LOGAN, ELEVEN AND A HALF MILES FROM PLYMOUTH,July 22, 1863-12.30 p. m.

GENERAL: Your telegram just received. The enemy passed this point morning at 7 o'clock, led by Morgan himself, with force variously estimated from 400 to 2,000; I think he has about 600 men. From the absolute want of horses, we are forced to pursue him with a little [over] 400 men. The enemy is going in direction of Nelsonville. I think he is trying to cross the Muskingum River and reach the Ohio at a point above navigation for gunboats. Our horses are terribly jaded; yet we will pursue the enemy to the utmost capacity of men and horses. No horses upon this road to get.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Brigade.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE.

CAMPBELL STATION, CENTRAL OHIO RAILROAD,

Guernsey County, Ohio, July 24, 1863-9.30 a. m.

GENERAL: We have just reached this point. The enemy destroyed four car-loads of tobacco and all the railroad building and bridges. We are nearly 5 miles in his rear. Our horses are greatly fagged, and the men fatigued with night and day marching, but in fine spirits and eager for chase. We will press on with all possible dispatch. The enemy has gone to Washington.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE.
