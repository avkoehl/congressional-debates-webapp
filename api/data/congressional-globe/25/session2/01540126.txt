reason of the war being kept up He felt suffi-
ciently humbled bj this outiageous and disgraceful

fortunate Indians m th ir hammocks than from

Mi DOWNING said it was witu tne deepest re
gret that he had listened to the íemarks of the gen-
tleman from Virginia He had in his possess on
information which would show the He use the ne-
cessitj of making this appropriation
The gentleman hfd charged that the war was
iniquitous in "ts inception, base and infamous in its
uses, and would bendiculous m its conclusion But
he would tell that gentleman, and he defied contra-
diction, that the war was based ¿n a solemn treaty
with the Indians, made deliberately, and with their
full consent Hitheito, there had not been the
slightest charge against its \aliditv, not e\ en a whis-
per had been breathed about unfairness or fraud
The treaty had bpen executed on the part of Go-
vernment, not in a hurried manicr, but in a calm
and deliberate w ay, Ihe chiefs on tne part of the In-
dians having hed ample time to re'lect and consjdei
the proposition But it was with the Seminóles as
it was with the Cherokees, w ho, aftei having re-

of Florida had heard nothing- from the pulpit and

and such ebullitions of blind feeling, the war would
long since have been suspended Had the people
of Florida been permitted to adopt their own mea-
suies, and if the rope and the gallows had been
used, a-- they v. ould in the case of white men com-
mitting such enormities, the affair would have been
settled long before this.
But, notwithstanding the atrocious conduct of
these «Uanous- objects of sympathy—notwith-
standng the} had murdered our citizens, destroyed
oui property and besieged our towns—notwith-
standing all this, yet the gentleman refused to grant
an appropriation for he purpose of protecting our
citizens fiom a recurrence of such outrages
But public sentiment and sympathy was ever
ready to ex'rt itself for the red man and the negro
The white men of the South might be butchered by
hand!eels, and the act looked upon with indif-
ference, but when colored skins were concerned,
then it was that an outcrj^was raised It was for

thy boiled and babbled over
The gentleman had intimated that the people of
Flonda were "fattening upon the appropriations "
He would ask that gentleman to cast his eyes upon
their desolated cities, their wasted and impoverish-
ed country, and then say from whence had they k
the means of "fattening on the appropriations " i
Their hoises, their wagom, their provisions and <
sustenance w is gone, and the whole of their pro-
perty had been destroyed and taken by the enemy
Had the gentleman been able to show but one in-
stance wh're the public money had fell to the share
of the p pple of Florida, and been improperly used,
could he adduce one instance of fraud on their
part' It was true that charges had been made
in the House, through the medium of anony-
mous letters, about $10 being paid for wagons,
w nen the same could be halt for $5, etc, and it had
also been alleged that a crtain quartermaster had
aken a receipt for more than an article had cost, for
the purpose of pocketing the money But were
they thus to be influenced by charges through such
sou ices' If gentlemen knew of any such cases
where fraud had been practised, it wj  their duty to
make complaint to the proper department, when they
might rest assured that ample redress would be ob-
tained But for the people of Flonda to be told,
when they had been deprived of the necessaries of
life, that they were getting rich and fattening upon
the spoils—
Mr WISE assured the gentleman that he was
laboring under a mistake He had charged nobody,
but had merely expressed a hope that the House
v ould direct its inquiry to the points where suspi-
cion existed He did not allude to the people of
Florida, but to the Government contrac ors
Mr DOWNING begged to inform the gentle-
man from Vuf ma, that in the whole Territory of
riorida, there was nota single Government con-
tráctil The contracts were made elsew iere, the
horses being chiefly obtained from Kentucky, and
the provisions and ammunitions fiom Nen York
and Charleston The poor citizens oí Flor da had
received nothing but the small pitta-ce of six dol-
íais per month for all their labor, the r sn eat and
their blood, and of even that small sum, gentle-
men sought to deprive them, by refusing to vote
for the appropriation Was that propei, after the
citizens had been en"ag d to figh' the battles of
their countrj, to refns to grant thern that slender
recompense'
Mr WISC did not mean to be understood as
opposing ti e payment of anj just claim against the
Government All he wished for wjs, that if an
appropriate n were made, that steps should be
tanen to insure the people of Florida m getting
their due, and to prevent the money from bemg
swallowed up by harpies, feeding on the camón of
that war
Mr DOWNING contended that it was the duty
of Government, ha-v ing contracted a debt, and when
sa'isfied of a just claim, to pay it immediately,
and then, if any fraud was suspected on the
pait of agents and others, to make it an after
subject of investigation He had not the slight-
est objection for a full investigation of the conduct
of Government in relation to the war, as he was con-
fident the Government could be justified in every act,

The business had been transacted through the
means of agents, and if the agents themselves had
been deceived was. that the fault of Government}
Had there been any abases made known to the
proper authorities, which had not been rectified?
But because one out of the thousand officers of the
militia, who from necessity were made disbursing
officers, because one of these had acted dishonestly,
was the Government tobe held responsible' Was
it upon such charges that the appropriation was re-
fused, the time of the House wasted, and the Go-
vernment as¡>ailled?
Mr D then alluded to the treachery of the
Seminóles, and said he was ready to prove, that
although heie they pretended to desire peace, yet
w hen they returned to their tribes, they breathed
noth ng but war * He adverted to the conduct of
the two chiefs, Jumper and Alligator, m instigating
the enemy to hold out to the end of spring, as Con-
gress would make no appropriation, etc He re-
ferred to three letters which he had received in
proof of it, and which were being published m the
newsapers of Florida.
It has been charged by the gentleman from Ken-
tucky, (Mr Underwood,) that there were more
troops m Florida than the whole number of Semi-
nóles, including squaws and children. For his
part, he did not profess to know the exact number
of the enemy, but if from the obstacles presented
it was found that ten thousand troops were not
sufficient, why it was their duty to send twenty
thousand But one gentleman had proposed to
draw the troops from Florida This was certainly
a strange course, and he (Mr D ) was entirely at
a loss to ascertain by what rule*of arithmetic the
gentleman had acted, when because ten thousand
were not enough, he proposed to leave but two or
three thousand
Mr D then alluded to the peculiarity of the
Florida war, and the impossibility of meeting the
Indians m a body, so as to attack them with any
chance ofsuccess ¡3 r, said Mr D they are scattered
over the countiy, east, west, north, and south, they
are here and there, and j et nowhere. They were
just like a flea, the momenta man put his hand upon
one, thinking he had caught him, that instant
it would be in some other place He appealed
to the gentleman, if, for the sake of a few paltry
dollars, they would sacrifice the lives of our troops,
when fighting with a white enemy, by sending out
only a certain number. When the war commenced,
it was thought that an appropriation of five mil-
lion's would be sufficient He thought so too But
because, from a combination of unlooked for
events, a greater amount was required, gentle-
men complained that the war was unjust, and de-
manded an investigation It was the first time he
had been told that, after the people of Florida had
suffered so severely, their savage foes were to be pitt-
ed He wished gentlemen who said so, would first
take the trouble to go and examine for themselves.
Mr D here drew an amusing comparison of the
notorious Nat Turner, once concealed in the Dis-
mal Swamp, and the Florida Ind ans He then
alluded to the many efforts and applications; from
various quarters to induce the cifzens of Flonda
to allow the Indians to locate on toeir territory,
and to free their slaves , but he wou'd assure them
that they would never submit to dictation, for the
peop'e of Florida would not free their slaves, neither
would they allow the Indians to remain among
•hem
Mr D went on at some length to comment on
the numerous obs-acles presented to the troops in
carrying on the w a-, the chief of which was the
misplaced "sympathy of the public, which compelled
the officers to relax from a policy which otherw ise
could not fail to bring the contest to a speedy ter-
mination He alluded to the unhealthy climate of
Flonda, which prevented anv action during the
summer months, and contended that the whole of
the fighting season, from the commencement of the
w ar, did not amount to more than nine months.
By that means almost insurmountable obstacles
were presented, for the provisions had to be recart-
ed, the lost time to be regained, ana then the season
foi exertion was so short that scarcely any thing
could be accomplished Mr. D. concluded by
mamiaimng the fusuce of the tieaty, and the utter
