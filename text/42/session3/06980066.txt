It will be seen from this last table that the
grand average of transporting a bushel of
wheat from the principal grain centers in the
West is cents, and of a bushel of corn
33^ cents.
I now submit an estimate of the cost of
transportation on the Virginia route. It is a
paper prepared by E. Lorraine, late United
States engineer in charge, and chief engineer
of the James River and Kanawha Company:
St. Louis to Point Pleasant, 903 miles.
Canal boats of 280 tons carry 9,240 bushels of wheat,
or 10,000 bushels of corn.
Total through freight, both ways, now carried by
rail and water north of Ohio, 8,000,000 tons annually.
The expense per mile of the canal steamer Baxter
lor fuel, engineer, and fireman was twelve and a
half cents per mile. Traveled on the canal threo
and two tenths miles per hour, including lockages,
consuming five tons of coal on the trip.
Cost per day for fuel, engineer, and fireman.. 89 00
Four hands  5 00
Captain  2 00
Cost per day of working  16 00
Wear and tear of boat per day  2 50
Interest on cost, say ten per cent, on $7,500 2 50
Add for incidental expenses  1 00
Total cost of running per day  22 00
Fourteen days from St. Louis to Richmond
at $22  308 00
Nine thousand bushels of wheat at 3.42
cents  308 00
Time from St, Louis to Hampton Roads.
Miles. Sours.
St. Louis to Point Pleasant 903 150.5
(six miles per hour.)
Point Pleasant to Paint creek  79 13.2
(six miles per hour)
Paint Creek to Greenbrier bridge ...118 23.6
(five miles per hour.)
Greenbrier bridge to Richmond .275 91.7
