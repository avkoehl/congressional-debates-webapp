Catawba Mountain about 4 p.m., where we remained until 9 p.m. Here we had some skirmishing with the enemy, and marched to Craig's Creek and encamped for the night.

On the 22nd we resumed our march by way of New Castle, Red Sweet Springs, and White Sulphur Springs, and passed through Lewisburg on the 25th and encamped for the night at Meadow Bluff.

On the 26th we left Meadow Bluff for Camp Piatt, where we arrived on the 29th, having traveled a distance of 322 miles from the time of leaving Staunton on the 10th instant.

A list of the casualties in my brigade accompanies this report, the aggregate of which is: Killed, 29; wounded, 134; missing 27; total, 190, and is distributed among the different organizations in the brigade as follows:

Command.	 Killed.	 Wounded	 Missing	 Total.*

The conduct of the officers and men before the enemy and during the long and tiresome march was all that could be expected of brave and gallant men. Many of the men are somewhat broken down and foot-sore, and some few have suffered for the want of proper food, which could not be obtained in the country through which we passed during the last few days of our march, but all are in excellent spirits, and will be ready for action again in a short time.

I have as yet received no official report from the battalion of the Third and Fourth Regiments Pennsylvania Reserve Volunteer Corps, but am informed by Captain Sweet, commanding, that no casualties occurred in that command.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. CAMPBELL,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.
