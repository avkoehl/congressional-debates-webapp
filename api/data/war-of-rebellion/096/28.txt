(Received 1 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

There are but few steamers available here at present. The Ericsson draws over twenty feet of water, loaded, and will carry 1,200 men. The Rapidan draws fourteen of water, and will carry about 1,000 men. These are the only vessels I know of not under charter. The United States and Cassandra are loading for Fort Monroe, and will sail on Thursday; they will carry 800 men each, and draw some sixteen feet of water. The Enterprise is expected here to-day from Fort Monroe. But these vessels are very much needed for services connected with this depot.

Brevet Major-General MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

Can also obtain the Suwo Nada--1,200 men, and sixteen feet loaded; she is coaled, and can start in twenty-four hours. Another steamer, the Oriental, is expected to-morrow morning; she can carry 1,000 men. Does the Ericsson draw too much water? She is being got ready.
