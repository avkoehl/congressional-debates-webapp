river, to take your position with Reynolds' division, as indicated in the instructions which have already been sent you, you will move your division by this route to Trenton, following up General Negley as closely as possible.

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Moore's Spring, Ala., September 3, 1863.

Major-General NEGLEY,

Commanding Second Division:

You can see from the above order of march that it is General Rosecrans's wish to seize Stevens' Gap at a point where the road through Johnson's Crook passes across Lookout Mountain into McLemore's Cove. Therefore, I want your division to move by the most direct route to where Johnson's Crook road turns off from the main Lookout Valley road.

This route will take you by Brown's Spring, where you had better encamp until I can overtake you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Send one brigade from Baird's division, without artillery, with two days' rations, from Trenton to seize Frick's Gap, if he joins you in time at Trenton to do so; should he not reach you in time, send one from your division.
