WASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Fort Monroe:

Your dispatch in relation to the gunboats has been laid before the President. He has directed the Hunchback and Perry to remain where they are, and that Goldsborough's order for their removal be countermanded. This I understand to be satisfactory to you. I should be glad to have a detailed statement of your force and its position.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

FORT MONROE, June 9, 1862-5 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Three regiments on Roanoke Island, one at Washington, one at New port on railroad, and one and a half at Beaufort and Fort Macon; fourteen at New Berne. One regiment artillery and one regiment cavalry and three batteries divided along the different commands. A large portion of the force at New Berne is on picket duty. Regiments average 600 effective men. I leave for McClellan's at once. Will telegraph you before I return to New Berne.

BURNSIDE.

FORT MONROE, June 11, 1862-10.30 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just returned from McClellan's headquarters, where I passed about six hours. It stormed very hard all day. The roads are in the most wretched condition. I was four and a half hours traveling 9 miles. It is impossible to move artillery whilst they are so bad. But for the railroad, the army could not be subsisted and foraged. The general health was improving. The officers and men are in good spirits. I will write you fully of our consultation about co-operating. I would very much like a personal interview, but feel that I cannot remain away from my department any longer unless you desire it. I would be glad to get any instructions you may have by telegraph.

BURNSIDE.

P. S.-Since writing the foregoing I have just heard from my department by a boat which left Roanoke at 7 o'clock last evening. Everything quiet.
