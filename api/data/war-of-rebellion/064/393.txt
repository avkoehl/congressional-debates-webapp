WARRENSBURG, MO., June 15, 1864.

Brigadier General JAMES TOTTEN,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report that a detachment of the Fourth Missouri State Militia are guarding the bridges east of Sedalia. West of that place I am trying to guard the bridges and the workmen employed in building the railroad by a chain of patrols. Infantry would be much better for bridge guards and guards at our depots, as I have to haul forage from 35 to 50 miles, taking large escorts that could be better employed.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 15, 1864.

Brigadier General JAMES TOTTEN,

Chief of Staff:

I ordered one company of the Fourth Missouri State Militia to Saline County on the 7th, which on the 10th was ordered to be relieved by two companies of the First Missouri State Militia. Last fall I built good stockade forts at Miami, New Frankfort, and Cambridge City. At Arrow Rock, Marshall, Brownsville, and Cambridge City there are home-guard companies. The force sent to Saline County will take, in haversacks, their rations, and be believed by other troops every ten days. The guerrillas can concentrate force enough to overpower small escort, and it is not practicable to establish small camps about that part of the country.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Warrensburg, Mo., June 15, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that the concentration of the troops of this district for the purpose of discipline and drill, in obedience to the instructions of the major-general commanding, leaves a large proportion of the country liable to the raids of guerrilla bands, and while it is not possible to entirely prevent them, yet I respectfully represent that I think that they may be lessened by calling into active service a few companies of Enrolled Missouri Militia for local protection, as requested in my dispatch of May 30.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 15, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I respectfully request that one company of the Illinois Regiment ordered to this district stop at Jefferson City, one at Sedalia, and the balance move to this place.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
