" The average price per 1,000 feet of Canadian lum-
ber that paid duty in 1853 was'$i); hi 1854, §9 75: in 1855,
-when it paid no duty, $10 50; in 1856, $10 75: in 1857,
$1150; afterwhiclitimotheprieeagainfelloff to$7 75,
and then worked gradually up again to an average of
$10 in 1863. Thus it will be seen that before the treaty
Canadian lumber cost us less than it did afterward,
proving that the producers in this ease were the
only'persons benefited. Wo did not even increase
the quantity received more than the natural increase
of business. In 1853 the price was, on an average,
$9 per l'.OOO, and the total value reeeivod that year
was $2,383,181, on which we received 20 per cent. duty.
In 1861 the price averaged $050, and the total amount
received from the same source was only $2,065,870.
That paid no duty. The price was 50 cents per 1,000
more than in 1853, yet th e value was $317,314 less than
when they paid the 20 per cent. Therefore we gained
nothing in price and nothing in quantity more tban
wo could liavegot had the duty been continued."
The imports from Canada alone, as stated in
the report of the director of the Bureau of
Statistics of commerce of the United States,
ending June 30, 1867, gives:
Boards, plank and scantling, feet  388,307,000
l-lewn timber, feet  200,620,000
Under the head of other lumber 156,138,000
And from other British American prov-
inces on the Atlantic:
Boards, plank and scantling  25,008,000
Hewn timber  104,000
Other lumber  4,705,000
Total  775,101,000
Over 200,000,000 feet more than the whole
product of the Saginaw valley.
Even if the amount were small, if by an open
market, they can drive our manufacturers out,
they can supply the deficiency.
Hon. James Sliead, of Ottawa, Canada West,
says in his report on Canada lumber, before the
commercial convention, in Detroit, in 18G5:
"Thocxtcnsion of free-trade principles will enable
those prosecutingit to enlarge itahnostindelinitely.
Tbiit the question of supply e:ni only be regulated
by demand."
Showing that if the Canadian manufacturers
once do get control ot' the market they can
hold and regulate it. fn my opinion the repeal
of the duly will result in giving the entire
eastern trade to Canada manufacturers, thereby
creating a monopoly and enabling thorn to con-
trol prices at their pleasure.
I call attention to the very large per cent, of
the cost of lumber paid for labor. The total
cost of the year's product is $0,-My,87-1 23 ; of
this $5,0-18,000 is for labor.
There was during the year 180'J exclusively
in the Saginaw lumber trade 00 barges, with an
aggregate tonage of 121,200, and a carrying
capacity of 19,4-10,000 feet of lumber. These
barges run mainly to Ohio and Lake Erie
ports, and make but an impartial showing of
the aggregate commerce affected by the lumber
trade ot the Saginaw liver. Five hundred and
fifty million foot oi lumber at an average of
our cargoes to 1,000,000 feet, will make 2,200
cargoes. Vessels and barges average 10 cargoes
a season, which will give us at this calculation
220 vessels and barges engaged in the trans-
portation of lumber. This auxiliary branch
of the lumber business gives employment ns
follows :
Vessels and barges, crews 8 sailors to a hull.. 1 760

So much space has been occupied in the
detail of the lumber production that I shall
but briefly allude to the production of salt.

The number of men employed directly and
indirectly in the manufacture of salt in the
State of Michigan cannot be less than 3,000,
and the average wages $2 per day. The same
rule, as before stated, will apply to the feeding
and clothing of these 3,000 men. The produc-
tion of iron and copper in Michigan has been

The imports of provisions and supplies into
the mineral districts for the same year amounted
to $10,000,000. The protection to iron and
copper tends very largely to constitute this mar-
ket for $10,000,000 worth of productions of
other localities.
The repeal of the duties on t-hese commodi-
ties would very seriously cripple if it did not
entirely stop the production of these vast quan-
tities of lumber, salt, iron, and copper. It
would also make the large sums invested in
these branches of business unproductive, thus
bringing to the people generally such injury as
thestagnation ol'business must inevitably bring.
Believing that the policy of a duty on imports
for revenue, with incidental protection to our
American industry, is wise, and agreeing as I
do in the main with the committee that have
proposed the bill under consideration, I will
take this occasion to say that in my judgment
tea and coffee should be added to the free list.
These articles we cannot produce ; they have
become to our people necessities, are u§ed
daily by all classes, and should be placed within ,
the reach of the poor at the lowest possible
price. England, from which a class of poli- 1
ticians in this country obtain their free-trade !!
ideas, raises nearly one half her revenue by :j
imposts on tea, coffee, and sugar. We ought
to object to this portion of English example— !i
the duty on tea and coffee—while we are so
thoroughly opposing her free trade notions as
to the articles she produces. This question is
not, and ought not to be, partisan. Good and
wise men in each of the great political panics
have been falsely educated to believe that free
trade should be the policy of this Government.
Mr. BIftD and Mr. BURDETT then ad-
dressed the House. [Their remarks will be
published in the Appendix.]
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise not for
the purpose of any lengthy remarks on the
bill now under discussion, for the time allowed
me would not permit if I desired to do so ;
indeed, if I had the time it would be unneces-
sary after the long and lengthy debate that has
taken place. But, sir, I cannot sit quietly and
thereby give my indorsement to the statement
made by the gentleman from Iowa that the
manufacturers of pig iron were netting a clear
profit of $15 per toil on every ton of pig iron
manufactured, and that it was selling at $40
per ton, and denouncing the "iron-masters"
of the country, as he termed them, a set of
monopolists who were receiving large and
extraordinary profits from their business. The
sales for the last few weeks show that pig iron
has been sold from $28 to $34 per ton, and in
my district costs to manufacture it from $28 to
$32 per ton, according to the price of materials.
It is hard to understand how the gentleman
holding the position he does on this floor, and
a member of the Committee of Ways and
Means, could be so ignorant of the cost of
making and the price of selling pig iron. I
see no way to account for it only that he lives
so far out on the praiiies, away from the man-
ufacturing interests of the country, that he is
not kept posted of what is going on at the sea-
board and in our great iron-manufacturing
districts.
Now, sir, the district that I have the honor
to represent is in part an iron district, and I
happen to know that the manufacturer of
pig iron in that district reaps no such profit as
the gentleman from Iowa intimates It has
been with great difficulty the blast furnaces of
my district have been able to keep in blast the
past winter, and some of the iron-mills have
been compelled to stop entirely. I only wish
the owners of these furnaces and iron-mills
could have been so fortunate as to receive agood
profit on their work; then we should not have
heard of any stops or any reductions of the
price of labor, but on the contrary, if good
profits and ready sales had prevailed, all would
have had plenty of work and wages have been
kept up. Indeed, in some of the iron districts
not far from my district, blast furnaces have
been running for some time, piling up their
pigs, as they cannot find sales and obtain a
satisfactory price for their manufactured pig;
and the same can be said of many articles man-
ufactured from iron.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great regret that I
see such a determined effort on the part of
some of the members of this House to break
down the industrial interests of the country.
This warfare on the iron interest especially is
unjust, uncalled for, and if successful would
depress, prostrate, and we fear wipe out this
great interest that employs and has so much
capital invested in it, and above all that gives
support and employment to so many thousands
of hard-working men, and who with their fam-
ilies are dependent upon proper protection to
the great iron interest of this country. In the
bill reported to this House by the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee I find that the
duty on pigiron has beenreduced to $7 perton,
instead of $9 per ton as it is under the present
tariff. I protest against this reduction and trust
the better judgment of the members of the
House will prevail, and they will see the pro-
priety of keening the duty on pig iron at its
present rate. '
in the remarks of the gentleman from Iowa,
that, the " ii'.m-masteis" were receiving large
profits, lie forgets that when these iron-men
