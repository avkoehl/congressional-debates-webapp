lery being left on the field to protect the collection of the stragglers and wounded, which was thoroughly accomplished.

Colonel Allen's brigade, on the left, moved forward through a wood and into some corn fields. They soon encountered the enemy in superior force, protected by houses and fences. They successively charged these positions, driving the enemy steadily back until within a few hundred yards of the river, where they were subjected to a destructive fire from batteries before mentioned and the enemy's gunboats. They charged and took a section from one of the enemy's batteries, Colonel Allen leading the advance with the colors of one of his battalions in his hand. It was at this critical juncture that, as before stated, this gallant soldier fell from his horse severely wounded, and during the confusion which followed this misfortune the enemy succeeded in recapturing the pieces. The enemy pressed heavily upon this brigade and poured into it such a galling fire from infantry and artillery that it fell back in some disorder. Colonel Breaux, who assumed command upon the fall of Colonel Allen, succeeded, with the aid of the officers of the brigade and two officers connected with the staff, who were sent to his assistance, in rallying a sufficient number to show front to the enemy until Semmes' battery was brought up, as already stated, to their support, and succeeded by a well-directed fire in preventing the enemy's advance. This position was maintained, despite the heavy firing on the brigade from the enemy's gunboats and land batteries, until the troops were withdrawn with the rest of the army to the suburbs of the town.

Lieutenant-Colonel Shields had been ordered, as already stated, to take position on the plank road leading from Clinton to Baton Rouge, and as soon as he heard the fire of our main body to attack a battery of the enemy, said to be stationed at the junction of the Clinton and Bayou Sara roads. This service was promptly and gallantly performed. He drove in the enemy's pickets, followed them up, and opened fire on a regimental encampment to the right of the Greenwell Springs road, driving the enemy from it. He was here met by two regiments of the enemy, but succeeded in holding them at bay till he was fired upon by our own artillery (fortunately without injury, four of the artillery horses disabled), and the infantry, unable to withstand the heavy fire of the enemy, he withdrew to his original position, where the wounded horses were replaced by others, when he returned to his advanced position, which he held till General Clark's division came up on his left, when the two companies of infantry were, by order of the major-general commanding, attached to the Twenty-second Mississippi Regiment. The section of artillery under his command retained its position until the army retired, when it rejoined the battery in the suburbs of the town.

In concluding this report of the battle I have the satisfaction of stating that the conduct of both officers and men was gallant and daring, every movement being performed with characteristic promptitude. I respectfully commend the report of commanders of brigade, as well as those of regiment, battalions, and independent companies, to the special consideration of the commanding general, and I also recommend the following officers and soldiers specially named in these reports to favorable consideration.*

The entire division entering the fight numbered but about 1,950 infantry and artillery, with a few irregular cavalry and Partisan Ran-
