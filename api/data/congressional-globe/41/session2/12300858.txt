THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 28,
hundred and eight thousand one hundred and
fifty-four dollars I A speculation as wholly and
totally unsupported by a particle of considera-
tion as the highwayman's profits upon a mid-
night adventure. I propose to tear away the
obscuring veils which have heretofore shrouded
this question. I shall run a dividing line be-
tween the sound and the unsound, that an
honest people may see plainly their duty to
themselves and their posterity.
In the year 1865 bonds for the additional sum
of $279,746,150 were issued, with the average
price of gold in the market at 143 in currency.
For them the traders in Government securities
paid $208,214,090, realizing as a bonus in the
transaction the sum of $71,582,060. The peo-
ple have paid as interest on this bonus the sum
of $12,875,772, and by the existing financial
system they will be called upon to pay $72,- j
062,708 more by the time these bonds mature, i
The gains of this year to the bondholder ;
appear thus:
Amount of bonds issued $279,746,150
Amount paid for them  203,214.090
Amount of bonus  71,532,060
Interest already paid on bonus  12,875,772
Interest yet to be paid on bonus  72,962,708
Amount paid and yet to be paid which is
without any consideration 8157,370,540
In 1866, with the price of gold at 141 in cur-
rency, the Government sold $124,914,400 of
its bonds, for which it received $88,591,773.
The bonus, or difference between the face of
the bonds and the price which they brought in
the market, in this instance was $36,322,627.
The holders of the bonds have received as
interest on this bonus $4,358,716. They are yet
to receive as interest on the same $39,228,444.
The following calculation will be found correct
for this year:
Amount of bonds issued $124,914,400
Amount paid for them  88,591,773
Amount of bonus  36,322,627
Interest already paid on bonus  4.35S.710
Interest yet to be paid on bonus  39,228,444
Amount paid and yet to be paid as bonus
and interest on bonus for which the
bondholder never paid anything  $79,909,787 i
In 1807 bonds for the vast sum of $421,469,-
550 were issued. With gold quoted at an aver-
age of 139 the purchaseisof these bonds paid for
thorn $303,215,503, making thereby $118,254,-
047 as clear profit in the operation. They have
collected as interest on this profit or bonus
$7,095,243. The amount yet to be paid on
the same as future interest until the bonds
mature will be $134,809,617 ; making in all an
account for the year of 1867, as follows :
Amount of bonds issued $421,469,530
Amount paid for them  303,215,503
Amount of bonus  118.2U,047
Interest paid on bonus  7,095,243
Interest yet to be paid on bonus  134,809,617
Amount paid and yet to be paid as bonus
and interest on bonus, (clear gain to
the bondholder,) $260,158,907
The issue of 1868 reached the sum of $425,-
443,800. The estimated price of gold being
136, those who bought these bonds paid $312,-
826,323; realizing as a bonus $112,617,477.
Their receipt of one year's interest on this j
bonus is $6,757,048, while there remains to be '
collected between this time and the maturity 1
of these bonds the further sum of $128,383,932
as usury, as interest upon nothing ever received
by the Government.

All the bonds which I have thus far consid-
ered bear six per cent, interest. During the
years, however, of 1864, 1865, 1866,1867, and
1868, there were issued five per cent, bonds
amounting in all to the sum of $195,139,550,
which at the various estimates already made
of the price of gold cost the purchasers the
sura of $122,957,410. The bonus to the bond-
holders growing out of the sale of these bonds
amounts to $72,182,140. The interest thus far
received on this fictitious $72,000,000 and up-
ward is $11,679,296. That which remains to
be received in the future on the same fraudu-
lent basis will reach $132,684,958. The trans-
actions of those five years in five per cent,
bonds may be stated in a condensed form thus:

Sir, allow me now to recapitulate and place
in a compact and distinct form the aggregate
of the obligations, thfe bonds which were
given as a bonus, as a bare gratuity, to the
reluctant and unpatriotic capitalists of the
country in order to win their support when our
need was the sorest. Allow me to array to-
gether the items of an appalling account now
in the hands of the tax-gatherer for collection,
every farthing ot which is a met-e fabrication
upon paper and as completely devoid of merit
as a forged check presented for payment. My
former statements and calculations establish
the following table, as showing the amount of
the people's obligations which the bondholders
obtained in the creation of the national debt
each year for nothingâ€”for absolutely nothing:
1862  $37,293,081
1363  130,012,736
1864  421,508,154
I860  157,370,540
1856  79.909,787

Konus and interest on five per cent.
bonds      216,546,394
Total SI,550,558.956
Here stands, then, this stupendous total of
$1,550,658,950, which the party now in power
says the people shall pay under inexorable
penalties, not one cent of which I have proven
ever left the coffers of the speculator or found
its way into the Treasury of a distressed and
si niggling country. I invoke scrutiny upon
my statements, and shall at all times defend
their substantial correctness.
But in this connection let us recapitulate
also upon another point; let us see distinctly
how much money the bondholders actually did
loan, did advance upon the bonds of the Gov-
ernment to aid the great cause of national
unity. 1 have already established the facts,
and now place them in tabular form. The pay-
ments of the bondholders were as follows:
186 2  $44,030,649
186 3  301,890,851
1864   189,697,636
1805   208,214,090
1866   88,591,773
186 7  303.215.503
1S6S  312,826,323
Amount paid for the five percent, bonds, 122,907,410
Total Si,371,424,238
Compare this amount of $1,371,424,238,
which the Government did receive, with the
amount for which our bonds are outstanding,
which the Government did not receive, and we
iind the following result:
Amount of debt which has no consider-
ation   _. ^1,510,558,956
Amount which was paid for  1,371,424,238
Excess of bonus and usury over the
actual debt    $170,134,718
Sir. who has known the parallel to this in
the history of constitutional Governments?
Where shall we look for comparisons to this j
monstrous oppression ? In what realm or land (
governed by written law will the explorer of (
other countries and other ages find such a ,
wholesale and flagitious plunder of.the people
as here stands .naked and confessed? (Jnder
what baleful sky, in what other quarter of the
earth has such an awful visitation fallen upon
human labor? Where else than in this laud
of professed equality has wealth ever before
committed a crime against industry and lib-
erty of such huge proportions and infernal
aspect as now towers up in our midst and
darkens the homes of the people with its cruel
and ceaseless demands? Kings, it is true,
unrestrained by law, have robbed their sub-
jects. Despots who rule by prerogative have
torn away the substance of their unfortunate
serfs and lavished it upon the favorites of the
throne. The pampered and lawless tyrants ot
Asia, Africa, and Europe have seized the fruits
of toil, the painful and precious earnings of
vigilant, daily labor and wasted them in palaces
of revelry and endless indulgence. The mil-
lions under imperial sway have been trodden
down, beggared, and held in servitude by the
unbridled avarice of absolute monarchs. But
in what region of the globe penetrated and
influenced by the popular will, where the voice
of the people was permitted to create their
laws, has ever before in the annals of the
human race such a giant extortion been fas-
tened like a vampire of death on the resources
of a nation?
Sir, we have heard the patriotism of the
capitalist made the eloquent theme of eulogy.
His praises have swarmed upon partisan lips.
The air has been laden and vocal with sweet
encomiums of his generous sacrifices. His
claims are exalted as those of beneficent phi-
lanthropy. He comes here with the air of a
public benefactor. He assumes a loftier port
than the heroes of the war, and demands pay-
ment for what he has done, as a first mortgage
on all the chattels, lands, and labor ot the
nation. Never since the birth of time, in the
whole wide range of human conduct, was a
pretension to virtue more false. Never was a
base assumption more utterly crushed by the
undeniable facts of history. Th. t beautiful
love of country, that sublime devotion to her
institutions which constitutes bulwarks of na-
tional defense more powerful than iron, brass,
or stone, was not an inmate of his breast. It
electrified all hearts but his. It ennobled and
glorified all classes save that which made mer-
chandise of the country's woes and trafficked
for a hundred per cent, of profit amid the
roar of cannon and a deluge of blood. The
father left his broken-hearted home ; the son
and the brother, in the brightness of youth, took
his last farewells of fainting kindred ; the
armies were filled with ardent, hopeful lives
as food for the leaden hail, the bayonet, and
the grave. Flesh and blood volunteered, or if
the precious ties of home and loved ones over-
mastered the patriotic will the draft, the unre-
lenting draft, replenished the ranks of war and
listened to no bargains in behalf of the hearth-
stones which it made desolate forever.
Butwhile the soldier stood on the outermost
brink of danger, while he walked on the per-
ilous ridge ot battle, the men of many millions
parted not with one dollar with which to pay
and feed him at his post of death until their
remorseless terms were complied with. Money
was no volunteer; nor did the fatal wheel of
conscription wrench it from the hands of its
sordid masters. It heard the beseeching \ oice
of the Government with a dull, indifferent ear.
It laid still in its vaults and dens watching for
its prey and its profits. It witnessed a devotion
and a sacrifice in this land more universal and
unselfish than ever before illuminated the pages
of time, and its metallic heart alone remained
cold and unmoved under the heat of the fiery
blaze. While the armies moved on and the lamps
of dear and valuable lives went out 011 the ghastly
field and in the hushed stillness of the hospital,
