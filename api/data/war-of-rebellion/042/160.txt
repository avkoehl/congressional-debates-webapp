It the militia and arms are taken from these border counties, they must suffer, for it is clearly demonstrated that the frontier regiment is not affording sufficient protection.

Would it not be well to order the State troops from several of those counties now suffering to aid and expelling the Indians, and would it not be well to call out the militia in those counties that have been exempted, and compel them to do duty on the frontier? for they were exempted for that purpose, and they ought to be made to act, and that speedily. They are also very much in need of ammunition.

The foregoing facts we most respectfully submit to your kind consideration.

Most respectfully, your friends and servants,

R. M. GANO,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry, C. S. Army.
