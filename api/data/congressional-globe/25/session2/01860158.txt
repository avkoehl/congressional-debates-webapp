The Ctum replied that the coherent accompa-
nied the primary question
Mr Wise raised the point of order, whether the
petiti m itself d'd not come under the operation of
the resolution of the 21st of December'
The Chair thought not
Mr Wise Was not the memorial substantially
praying tor what would open the whole subject of
abolition*
The Chair nas well advised of the point, which
had been decided some weeks ago, immediately
after the presentation of the first proposition of this
character, since which several similar petitions had
been offered, and the House had acquiesced in that
decision The Chair had no doubt that this peti-
tion was in order, and did not come within the ope-
ration of the resolution of the 21st December
Mr Wise Then I must be permitted to say
that, if that be the correct construction, that resolu-
tion was of no manner of use whatever
The question was then taken, and decided m the
affirmative—yeas 128, nays 75
So the question of reconsideration w as laid on
table ]
[AU the members from Massachusetts presented
petitions for the abo! tion of slavery, which went
on tne table under the ord r of the 21st of Decem-
ber a i umbi r u on ti,, i agnnst the annex?-
t o-i oi fe^is, and sci ei ü prijn g the reciss on of
said oiler, all ot which look tlu. same course on
lespective motions 1
Before Mi ADAMS had got through, the Ciu r
announced the arrival ot the hour lor the specnl
order
Mr AD4MS moved a suspension ol the rule
to enable him to piesent the petitions communicated
to his charge, and asked for the yeas anu najs
Mr HOrFMAN would vote tor the gentleman s
motion, Inn ted as it wis, but he preferred its
extension to all the other States behind Massachu-
setts
Mr ADAMS modified his motion according to
Mr   H's suggestion, but   the  House   recused  the
yeas and nays, and declined to suspend tie rule
MISSISSIPPI   ELLCTION
The House then resumed the consideration of the
Mississippi election case, the question being on the
amended resolution of Mi Bell adopted by th 
House on Wedne d i} last
"Resolved That the resolutorio! this House of
the 3d oi OctoLei 'ast, dtcltring that bAMUTL J
Ghoison and Ton-i V H Clubohvf were uu }
elected members oí the 35th Congress, be rescind
ed, and that Messrs Ghoi s n and Chjborne aie
not duly elected members < f tne 25th Congress "
The question was on the lolloini gamendment
of Mr Howard
"Resolved, Ttiat Sergeants Prentiss and Thomas
J W Old are noi members of the Twenty-fifth Con-
giess "
And the pending question on the amendmert to
the amendment, proposed by Mr ROBERrSON
to stake therefrom the «ord "not"
Mi MARTIN of Alabama being entitled to the
fl w, rose to proceed witn h s remarks, bat gave
wav to
Mi GL VSCOCK, wno stated that he had m  
mom ng received from the Hon VIr Claiborne a
brief statement, m wri ing, oí several important
facts in relation to ti e question bel ore the House,
and which he considered essential should be read,
and as the health oí Mr C still prevented his at-
tending in person, he (Mr G ) ielt it his duty to
make the motion that the paper he then held in his
hand be received, and read at the Clerk's table It
was due to the sitting members to say, that they
wished uo motion mude to print
Wash noto-j, Feb 5, 1838
Sip í eiew th tiansmit to you the proceed ngs
ot tae i)ei lOTat o members of both branches of the
Mississ pp Legis'ature, which I dtsiie may be laid
before theHouse At a moment when there is so much
contrariety of opinion as to public sentirrent in the
State of Mississippi, and after the gentlemen who
claim to supersede my colleague and rnjself, have
expressed an opinion that not ten citizens of that
State believe we are entitled to our seats for the
whole of the twenty-fifth Congress, I am gratified
at being able to furnish such evidence of the popular
will   it must be recollected that the gentlemen who I
attended this meeting compose, a majority of the |
Legislature, and that they represent the opinions '
of a large body of the people    They are familiar
with the history of this contested election from the
emanation of the writ, down to the decision of the
House in October,and the incidents subsequent there
to, they are fresh from communion with an enlight-
ened constituency, and, in all probability, are bet-
ter informed as to the real state ot opinion, than
either the honorable claimants, or ourselves, or
representatives from other Stales  The names that
appear on the face of those proceedings are amo^g
the most distinguished m the State for the high sta
tions hey occupy, for talents   for integrity, for all
that can give impartiality to evidence or weight to
character, audi trust their testimonv, thus solemny
and publicly rendered, will have its due influence
with the House
I feel bound to repeat, on this occasion, what I
have before declared, that prior to the July elec-
tion, my colleague and my self distinctly took the
ground, that we consideied the election as not for
the special session only, but for (too years The
papers friendly to us advanced the same opinion
When the decision of the House was made, con-
firming us m our seats foi the entire 25th Con-
gress, we addressed a Circular to he people,
(«Inch was widelj d) tributed,) from which tne ,
following is an extract
' TO THE PEOPLE OP MISSISSIPPI          I
'Teliow-citizfn     In   Ju'y   last,   it   is   we'l
1 n< tin, ne were elected und r the Proclamation of
the Got ernor, and according to the  forms of the
law, to represent you in Congress    WThen the Go- |
vernor issued his «rit, the opinion of the press and .
of the people, so far as we are informed or believe,
was, that he had the power to do so   that the  exi- '
gency of the times required htm  to  e\erc se that
power, but that he had no right to ?bndge the con-
stitutional term of two j ears, for  witch  members
of Congress aie elected, that so much of hs writ |
was void, and that the  members chosen   would
serve not only in the extra session, but throughout
the  tuenty-fitth Congress      This was  out   own |
op nion     It was every where freelv expiessed by
u    and we believe that nine tenths of those who
voted at the late [July] election went to  the  polls I
with such an impression "                                        I
The people were thus distinctly notified ol the
act on of the House, and assured that we wou'd
continue to hold our seats
Prevented as I am bv the state of mv health,
from appearing in the House lo vindicate the
rights of those I represent, I feel bound to express
my solemn conviction that a majority of the free-
men of Mississippi acquiesced in the judgment ol
the Hsuse I believe, upon evidence which would |
be conclusive in a court ol justice, that the 6 500 '
citizens who sustained me in November, did not
doubt the validity of the July election as conferring
office for two veais, or the binding eiitct of tne de-
cís on of the House
On the other hand I know, as post ivelv as any
fact can be known tnit upw ards of 8,0(10 voters,
chiefly in counties almost unanimous!) fav arable
to us, reposfd to cast their votes a second t me, on '
tne ground that the judgment of the House was
binding, and that thev were si s[jed Wllh jt j
haven® doubt but that 15,000 fieemen ol M ss s-
sippi, if an opportunity offered, would at this mo-
ment sanction that judgment at tin pohs I feel
convinced they would declare that no vacancy
could exist m the representation fr >m that State,
to be filled at the November election, after the de-
cision of the House, the constitutional and cnlv
competent tribunal, t at we were membeis oí the
whole 25th Congress Th?t dec sion was pro-
nounced after searching and protiacted evainna
tion, and upon the same evidence « h th is nou. before
the House, it persuaded us that the whole matter
was settled, it gavs to the clcnmaits the benefit of
a canvass without opposition, it restrained 8,000 free-
men, ¡rom casting their voir >, and should the House
now decide finally against us, however highly its
character is generally appreciated, the moral sense,
the proper and honorable pride, of an enlightened
people will revolt at the injustice of such a course
If this was not my solemn conviction, if I was
not, as I believe, fully informed as to the intentions
of those who voted for me in July, and of their
wishes and opinions now, if I conld be convinced
that the cl?imants received a majority of the whole
number of votes cast at the November election—
ex parte as that election was, and without opposing
candidates—I would at once close this controversy
by resigning my seat I feel satisfied that my col-
league would pursue the same course Although
disfranchised by the House, and prevented from be-
ing candidates by their resolution declaring us mem-
bers for two years, if (he claimants had presented
themselves here with a clear and properly ascer-
tained majority, we would cheerfully have resigned
our places, and submitted the matter to the people.
Such, however, in my opinion, is not the case I
believe that the popular will in Mississippi was ad-
verse to those gentlemen at the election, and that it
is still so, and however my « amng health or incli-
nations might otherwise influence me, my duty to
those who have, for a series of years, sustained me
with large and uniform majorities, will induce me
to hold my seat until I am ejected by the verdict of
the House That verdict has been once recorded in
our favor, and I trust the House will pause long
before reversing it, and the rights and equities it
carries with it I trust it will deliberate long beforp
it assumes the alarming prerogatue of appo*nlin$
others to the places that we hold by the votes and
will of the people op a sovereign Statf
Unable lp defend my cause in person, or to as-
sert with becoming spirit the view  and opinions of
a high-minded constituency, I appeal to the House,
through you, for its dispassionate and impartial
judgment. Regarding it as a tribunal too grave to
be influenced by passion, and too just to render
final judgment without positive knowledge of the
facts, I appeal to it, not for my colleague and mj-
felf, but for those we represent, not for the empty
honois of office,but for jictice to a people jealous
of an} encroachments on their rights
I hav e the honor to be,
Very respectfully,
Your obed't servant,
