Brigadier General JOHN P. HATCH,

Commanding District of Florida:

You have by this time received the order to send one white regiment to go to Washington and the One hundred and second [colored] to this place. Of course the present movements will interfere with the promptitude otherwise attainable in sending them forward, and I shall be content if you send them as soon as they come in from the raid. The orders are to rest on the defensive, but this does no prohibit all the raids being made that promise any adequate results, and I think your safety in Florida
