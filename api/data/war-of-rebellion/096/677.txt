HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 24, 1865- 9 a. m.

General R. B. POTTER,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

Your telegram of 11.50 last night received. Have you any further data in reference to the removal of guns? Cannot the signal people discover whether or not guns have been removed from the front line? I think it would be well to throw a few shell over and see if they bring any response. If so, I do not desire a general commanding, the object being to ascertain as far as possible the number of batteries and guns that have been removed from your front.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
