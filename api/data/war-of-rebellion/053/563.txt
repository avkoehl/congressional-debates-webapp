HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY IN MISSISSIPPI,Canton, September 16, 1863.

Respectfully returned to Colonel Logan for information, who will immediately return them to these headquarters.

By command of Major General S. D. Lee:

G. W. HOLT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,September 23, 1863.

So far as I know there are not a great many cattle in that section of the country. I also doubt the practicability of the enemy making a raid through that section; in fact it is almost destitute.

Respectfully,

J. L. LOGAN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

OKOLONA, August 29, 1863.

General J. R. CHALMERS:

Ferguson is on his old line; give him early notice of enemy in your direction. His headquarters at Tupelo. Establish your line to connect with his from Pontotoc. Will be at Columbus to-day, and next at Morton. Don't omit to notify General Johnston as well as myself of any movement of enemy.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

GRENADA, MISS.,

Major General S. D. LEE,

Columbus:

Scouts from Memphis report 1,000 cavalry sent up Memphis and Charleston Railroad. A negro brigade from Massachusetts has arrived at Memphis. General Grant has gone down the river.

J. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

CHATTANOOGA, August 29, 1863.

Lieutenant-General HILL,

Chickamauga Bridge:

GENERAL: General Bragg is of opinion that a "division should be held opposite Harrison, but need not be at the place;" that Clayton's artillery should not be left at Blythe's Ferry unless well protected. Liddell must, for the present, guard our depot. He further says:

Make your own disposition of the troops as they arrive, keeping in view a concentration at the earliest moment at such point as the enemy may cross; to this end it seems to me the main body should be along the railroad, with guard to the front on the river. Charleston should be held by a good force.
