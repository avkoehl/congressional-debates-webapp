toward Leesburg. Intelligence received at Dranesville raised the possibility of a considerable force there,and Colonel Kilpatrick deemed it best to advance on Leesburg with caution, and ascertain their force. At Goose Creek he found the bridge away and crossing difficult. The enemy's pickets were found at this point. He advanced on Leesburg, drove their cavalry (numbering almost 200) into the town, and found it occupied by about 500 infantry, including convalescents and armed citizens. A few shells, fired over the town, caused these to withdraw to a wooded hill, beyond the town. Our forces found several hundred muskets and rifles, which they destroyed. One 12-pounder howitzer was brought off. Paroled many prisoners and inflicted considerable loss on the enemy.

Our loss was 2 killed, 12 wounded, and 1 missing. Colonel Kilpatrick gives great credit to the admirable manner in which our guns were served, and the conduct of the Tenth New York Cavalry, which twice charged through the town. As far as could be learned, the enemy are not in any force in either Snicker's or Ashby's Gap, or Vestal's Gap; small scouting parties being, however, numerous in front of the Blue Ridge. The force at Leesburg was principally composed of convalescents, and cavalry sent to escort them. The whole country, from Warrenton to Leesburg, is filled with sick soldiers, abandoned on the wayside by the enemy. The expedition seems to have been conducted with spirit and judgment by Lieutenant-Colonel Kilpatrick.
