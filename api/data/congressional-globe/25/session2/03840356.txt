gery of Tieasmy nolts, and other public secuuties
The bill lo increase the salary of Ihe Commis
sicnei of Ihe Guieial Land Office, was taken up as
in Committee nl the Whole
Mi BUCHANAN inquired what was the sala-
ly of this ofiicei1 and v as answered by Mr Clw
oí Alabama that it was $}000
Mi B said lit, should like to know why the sala-
íy of this particular oflicer should be mcieased.
I'oi his pan, hr was opposed to increasing any sa-
lanes in the present condition of the Treasury, un-
less it could be shown that gieat injustice was done
the oflicer
Mr CLAY of Alabama said the object of ihe
committee in rtpoitmg this bill was to give to the
Commissioner a salary commensmate wnh llie
amount of labor he has to perfoim, and the mu.Hi
fence necessary for the discharge of ihe duties
whith devolve on him, und, in doing so, they had
reference to the duties devolving on othei oiliicis
at Ihe seat of Government, heads of Department,
as well as clerks He thought that if the Senaloi
irom Pernio lvima had taken into consideration
the duties p< i formed by the other officers of the
Government here, tcgelher with the degiee of intel
hgenoe neeessarj for their performance, and com-
pared th< m with those of the Commissioner of lh<
General Land Office, he would agree that, so far as
labor, talents, and legal siul), were concerned, tins
officer deseived a better salaiy than that now given
him In order to qualify themselves for conect
action on this subject, the committee had turned
their attention lo the amount of duties required of
the several heads of bureaus at the scat of Govern-
ment, and the qualifications necessary lo till those
offices, and they found that they were compara-
tively bettei paid than the oflicer whose salary
they proposed to increase The Pirst Comptroller
and Solicitor of the Treasurj received $3500 each,
anil it could not be said that the value of their
services was. equal to that of the services of the
Commissioner Ihcir duties wire not so ardutus,
and d d not «quire such talents for their perform-
ance Tli - Compnoller has only ihe supervision of
the account and, with the excep ion of the laws re-
littng lo the revenue, has no legal questions before
him, but tne. Commissioner of the Gener il Land Office
must not only be an accountant but a lawyer—in.
fact a jii(L,e of all Ine various questions «rising
out of our land laws that aie daily presented be-
fore him His office requires as much legal learn-
ing as is requisite in our courts of law He exer-
cises asupcuisory power, not only over the differ-
ent clerks in his office, but he must also understand
the print; iples of law, m order to prepare the differ-
ent íeporis, ida ing to his department, that are
submitted to Congre-s fie must also decide com-
p'icdted quest ons, arising not only under acts ot

lb.  country from ninth we have derived many of
ihe rules which govern the transfer and titles of
real estate It was und >r these considerations, and
wnh a full -uew of tl e duties of the other offiecrs
ot the Government, requmng less labor and less
talents m then performance, and to put the Com
missioner on the same footing with them, that the
committee have thonght proper to report this bill
They believed that a less amount than the salary
provided 11 ihe bill would not be adequate to the
services jierlonned by this officer, and that the
salary ought to be of such amount that, in the
event of the death or resignation of the present
incumbent, they might command the services of a
lawyer of the first eminence Mr- C. took this
opputtmily lo remaik, that it was not at the sug-
gestion of tlit Commissioner, or of any person foi
in n, or m led vulh his knowledge, that this bill
was reported
Mr BUCH IN AN had no doubt of the merits,
and qualifications of the present Commissionet of
the Gereial L md Oiiiee, and from the little inter-
course lie had had with him in regard to the duties
of his office, he believed he performed them wnh
ability and fidelity. But that was not the que5-
tion The question was whether in the present
condition of the Treasury, thej must borrow a thou-
sand dollars to add to the salary of this offieer, and
set an example which must be followed in regard
to the Auditors of the Treasury, ihe Second Comp
trailer, and other officers of Ihe Government Now
Ihe othei day m ihe Senate, they had the greatest
difficulty to get the salaries of Ihe Commissioners
to hem and examine claims against theGovern-
niciii as hif.li as the Commissionei now receives,
though ihen duties would be more important than
his Besides, there is a Solicitor of the General
Land Office lo give hisadviceon all legal questions
that are presented in it Mr B said that if he was
to give his vote to increase the salaries of any offi-
cers of the Government, it would be in favor of the
two Assistant Poslmasters General, whose salaries
weic only $3,500 each, and whose duttes were ex-
ceedingly arduonsand important He would not,
in ihe piesent stale of the Treasuty, when the Go-
vernment would have to borrow money, give his
(on-ent to increasing any salaries, unless a case
could be shim n w here gi "at injustice was done to an
oilit er, by iht mai'equ ioj of his compensation Mi.
C « on 11 not say any more on this subjeci, but in
oulti to list the question, he would ask for the
yeas and 1115 on the question of engrossi jg Ihe
bill
Mr CLAY of Ahbama rejoined that the duties
or the Uhce leqmred a much higher order of ta-
le nt than a mere Auditor of Accounts There
weio hundreds and thousands of acres ofthepnb- -
lie domain submitted to Ihe decision of this offi-
ce) , who he [Mr C ] had understood, from com-
petent authorily, had to devote a portion of the
mthl, as well as the day, to the duties of his of-
fice Mr. C could not agree that, because theie
was no money in the Treasury, that a mere act
of justice should not be done to a faithful and com-
petent ofhepr He felt convinced that the con-
templated increase was due to the office, to se-
cure competent talent when it might be necessary
to fill it hereafter
Mr BUCHANAN said that he wanted the prin-
ciple decided now, because if it should be decided
to raise any salaries, he would move to increase
those of the !ho Assistant Postmasters General.
Mr CLAY of Alabama, said that, as the Señale
was then linn, and he wished a full vote on the
question, he would move to lay the billonihe table.
This motion was lo t without a division
