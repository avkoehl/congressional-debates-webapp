The regiment conducted itself gallantry during the day. Whilst it was detached from the brigade, the only complaint I hear was that we were kept from coming to close quarters with the rebels. As regards its behavior in the night engagement, we were under the immediate observation of the brigade commander, who can speak as to our deportment.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. TWENTY-FOURTH MISSOURI VOL. INFANTRY,La Grange, Tenn., July 21, 1864.

In compliance with orders received this date, I beg leave to hand you the following report of the part taken by the Twenty-fourth Missouri Volunteer Infantry in the battle of the 15th instant:

On the afternoon of the 15th instant, when encamped about seven miles north of Tupelo, the enemy threw into our camp, unexpectedly, shells. By order of Colonel Gilbert, our brigade commander, my regiment was immediately formed in line and marched toward the enemy, but was held with the Thirty-second Iowa In reserve and formed in the rear of the Advanced line of the brigade at the base of a hill perpendicular to the road. We remained in this position a short time, when we were ordered to advance by Colonel Gilbert. I moved my regiment by the right flank to the road, marched along the road in direction of the enemy, and were formed in line of battle about three-quarters of a mile in advance of our former position. At this point we remained, had no engagement with the enemy, except an occasional shot by our skirmishers, until sundown, when we fell back by order of Colonel Gilbert, brigade commander, one-quarters of a mile and remained in line of battle during the night.

During the above engagement our casualties were none.

No complaint was heard through my regiment, but a desire to meet on the morrow the already vanquished foe.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. FYAN,

Major, Commanding Twenty-fourth Missouri Volunteer Infantry.

Lieutenant WILLIAM G. DONNAN,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, 2nd Brigadier, 3rd Div., 16th Army Corps.
