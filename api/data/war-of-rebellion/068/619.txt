Howell is at Howlett's house, beyond Ware Bottom Church, on James River, and is all right. General Turner's brigade is at the junction of new and old pikes, near the railroad, and will remain there until further orders. Colonel Howell ought to hold his ground if you expect to demonstrate on the right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,May 10, 1864.

General GILLMORE:

Will order Ames' brigade to relieve Wistar, and Turner to relieve Heckman, and as soon as Heckman and Wistar are relieved and get into position Generals Turner and Ames will retire.

Major General B. F. BUTLER:

Major General W. F. SMITH:

GENERALS: Brigadier-General Turner has been withdrawn. The Third New Hampshire Regiment, from the bridge, is here; my entire force is retiring and on the pike. General Ames took the old pike on the right, but General Smith's force is in General Ames' advance. The enemy are turning General Terry and should be attacked in flank.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS GENERAL AMES,May 10, 1864.

Major-General GILLMORE:

Generals Ames and Turner are moving up to relieve Heckman and Wistar. Do you wish them to await further orders before they commence to retire, or shall they commence the movement as soon as Heckman and Wistar are out of their way? Which brigade, Ames' or Turner's, do you wish to retire first, as the other must form the rear guard? Some word should be sent to Third New Hampshire, so that they know when to move. I will await your answer by my orderly.

R. S. FOSTER.

I think all the artillery and wagons should be sent back instanter, except one section with rear guard.

FOSTER.
