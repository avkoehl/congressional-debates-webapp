WILMINGTON, January 19, 1865.

Major-General HOKE,

Sugar Loaf:

How do you think they will attack-by land, or water, or both?

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 19, 1865-2.45 p. m.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy, I think, will attack with their boats from the river and sea, and then move upon us with infantry. Masonborough should be carefully looked to.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

WILMLINGTON, January 19, 1865.

Major-General HOKE,

Sugar Loaf:

Large numbers of cattle said to be on banks the other side of sound, above and below Masonborough. Could be driven off easily at night. If safe to do so, direct Limpscomb to secure them.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WILMINGTON, January 19, 1865.

Major-General HOKE,

Sugar Loaf:

General has selected line from head of Barnard's Creek to Hewlitt's Creek, out of fire of fleet. An engineer goes to-morrow morning to examine. Let one of your staff meet him at 10 a. m., on Telegraph road, about seven miles below here, to examine with him. Answer.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUGARLOAF, N. C., January 19, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I will have a staff officer to run out the line with the engineer officer to-morrow. The enemy advanced a line of skirmishers, supported by one line of battle, at one portion of the line and two lines at another. My skirmishers were not dislodged. The gun-boats of the enemy cannot dislodge me, and I feel confident of being able to repulse them in case of an attack on my front. The power of the enemy to go around me without my being able to get at them is the only thing that concerns me. I like the situation of the proposed line.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
