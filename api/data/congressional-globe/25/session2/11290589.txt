25th Cong* * "gyp Sess ______Independent Treasury—Mr, Dunn.                                                        H. of Reps.
tered interests Sir, language but little, if any, lest violent drove
the rioters upon Haus flour store in NewYoik No man told
them todo the deed It was just such inflated pictures of ima
gmed wrongs fhat maddened the multitude just such solemi
■warnings oí what might harpen, that taught them what to do
Sir, I^cquit that gentleman of any intention or wish of produc
mgstfcfc results by the language he used, but of its tendency
none can doubt, and, therefore, much is it to be regretted that it
Was ever used here It isjsuihcient for my purpose that it placts
the banking interest in an unfavorable litrht h* fore the conntiy,
and is calculated to discredit and destroy confidence
Mr Chairman, I might detain you here tor the balance of the
session with proofon this point, extracted from the Government
piesa in every quarter of the country But it is too well known,
that, for the past year, it has been the special luty of every pa
per in the support of Government, or under its pay, to abuse
the banks, and every body connected with them I shall, there
fore, contemmyselt with refeirtng you to an < <ctrait, of recent
date, from the Government organ published in this city
In an article headed " The Real lle'icf," in the Globe of the
23d April last, we have such expressions as follow Speaking
oí the banks which had suspended because the New Yoik t anks
had done so, the editor says
' A part of these have since cl ised their eyes in eternal sleep,
and,so far as they aie concerned, the event has proved that it
was approaching insolvency and not the example of New
York, which occasioned them to ahut up How many moie
may be in the like condition, time will soon tell, and especially
will it soon tell how stands the account, with that living person!
fication of trick and impudence, that Jupiter Tonans of rags
and shm plasters, that succedaueum of spavined, foundered,
and wind broken politicians, that huge and helpless carche
across which Mr liiddle sits, and on which a brood of harpits
roost and feed "
Then, sir, follows a great deal about "her enormous debt^'
anJ ht often c edits" llevuthuty million* of immediate Ha
bill ties, which four millions of &pecie ' in vam attemp to look
in the face Her debtors and rasouicea are described as "worn
out politicians," "editors of newspapers, depreciated stocks,
and loans upon long time at low interest, to cousins, jobbeis,
parasites, and sycophants "
All this is pressed upon the pu die, although the editor admits
that "doubtless a catastrophe to his [Mr Biddle'sj" Hj.nk will
carry mischief to a great many famines m the United States"
But, byway of romlort, he says that,
'The chief loss in the United States may be in the reoiirr c
tton notes, now under discussion in the Senate Be the event
what it may, the hundred millions oi? gold axd silvpr in
the country is the sheet anchor and relief oí the people I et
the productive clasps begin to look out tor i shaie of th it, and
they are sale ' Many other banks wil' be involved hi any c i
tastrophe that mav befall the'great regulator' '
May we nat here find some symptorrs of hostility as defined
by the Senator from Missouri, [Mr Benton"*] Such unparal
leled and gross abuse of Mr Biddle's Bank may be considered
fair for all who belong to the. Administration Yet it does not
appear teme likely toaidm the operations of com oiercej or m
the restoration of specie payments to be thus underminm* the
credit of an institution of such extended business, especially
when the editor tells us that "doubtless a catastrophe to his [Mr
Biddle's] Bank will cany mischief to a great many families "
And surely it must be vet y cold comfort to the business com
munity to be assured that the chief loss will be m the resurrec
tion notes, which happen to amount to the very íespecuble
sjra ofaboutsix millions of dollars
Political partisans may think the "m ochief to a great many
families," and the Joss of six millions of doliai  to the commu
miy, well repaid by the destruction of this odious- monster, the
United States Bank But I fancy sir, the poor families the
widows and orphans who own the stock, the I jsmess men who
handle the papei, will derive but 1 ml 1 consolation fiom that
result* or find tbe imagined relief in the hundred millions of
go'd and silver m the country
In the assurance that "many other banks wt'l be involved in
any catastrophe that may befall the 'gr<-at regulate!,'" may
wejnotfind something veiy likely to discredit banks, and de
stroy confidence in theníí And does not the recommendation
to the productive classes to begin * to look out for a share ' of
the gold and silver, look very much like an attempt "to excite
runs upon" the hanks' and blow them up?"
And now, &n, let us dwell but for a moment upon this act of
"treachery" for which the banks have been arraigned and pei
secute 4 with s  much violence It is the fate suspension of
specie payments I understand the friends of the Administra
tion are not willing to go behind that ait, and inquire into the
causes which led to it, for then it is soon brought home to their
own ansurd tinkering and experimenting on the cuirei cy It
is culled tieacheiy to the Government The banks owed the
Government for us deposites, and the people for it*  p^per, they
cou d not pay both in specie, and would not pay one m pre
ference to the otliei, and thus, because the Government was
unwilling to shaie the same fate with the people the banks aie
denounced foi it Time will not i emiit that I should detail the
cv Is that would have resulted frem an opposite course It is
sufficient for me to say that for this act the banks have been
tiled and acquitted They have t een tried by the State Legis
latuics, to whom th y were alone amenable, eveiv one of which,
I believe, has been mses&ton since this act of tieacheiy took
place, and in no instance has it been condemned, but, on the
contrary, has been approved of as the only course that could
have been taken to save the country from fargreatei disasters
And sir, have they not been tried by the people, toof and in
every instance wh^rethe mue has been fairly made up m spite
of all the exertions of politicians and the press, the people have
• istamed them
We have seen what pains have been taken both in the Daw-
son I t^r and elsewhere, to convey the impression thit these
institutions are warning in patriotism, that they should not be
trusted, for fear that they would seek to thwai t the Government,
overthrow it, and bring it into subject  n to a foreign joke
Mr Chahman, tell me if you can, of any interest in this coun
try that will suflfei so much from foreign conquestas the bank
ing interest will Does it possess any charm that will protect it
from the exactions and plunder consequent on such occasion*?
Mr, wd find the storm, of war and invasion always falling most
heavy in that direction And, sir, what proud examples does
our hwtory furnish ol the most devoted patriotism on \h? part
of these institutions and their owners when did jour coun
try, in her utmost need, call for supplies to fight thecomm n
enemy, arid not find these institutions ready to aid? Did they
then seek for pretences to thwart and overthrow the Govern
mentí Sn, in one official report, I find it stated that a few banks
advanced on loan to the Government, during the last war, over
six millions of dolíais, ntaily one tenth of youi whole war debt,
and this does not include occasonal sums advanced on Treasury
notes and othei wise for often was it the case that your ships
could not sail, oi your armies march until the advances were
made \nd this was done by banka m their corporate capa
city, embaí raised as they then were and limited in number and
capital Who can estima e the sums thus loaned for the sei
vice of'he country by stockholders, officers, and persons othet
wiue connected with banks? When we consider that nearly all
men wlo hdve spare money are in some way interested in
these instituí ion s,and that u isirom such men that these supplies
mainly come, it may be readily asserted that more than one
halt, it not three fouiths of jour war debt} came out of the
pockets of thee bankeis
It has been the policy of the administration to denounce this
inteiest at. aiistocratic The party press has been, and is,
li led with the outciy against these "monopolies"—"rag ha
rons ' and the eftoi t seems lo be to convey an impression that
these institutions are altogethei owned by an exclusive class, a
pnvileged few, and the idea of great wealth is attached to thein
Sir, I think an investigation will satisfy every one that the busi
nesü of banking in thiscountiy l&moHgeneiatly diffused among
all (lasses of society I have no general knowledge that wiit
euide me m forming an opinion upon this subiect, bu*, so far as
loc il information goes, Jtis to the comiary And it was but the
other day that I met accidentally with a statement of the number
and the occupation of the stockholder* of foui banks I think m

It ar peaisveiy evident that the great object of government is
to reach that power ol concenti Ued action on the part oí the
(eople   '•o efhciertly embodied m the fum of cotporations
-in 1 which horn i b^att ¡y   lmphcity, and complete adaptation

aristocracies, ulceis on the body politic   exclusive pnvilegt
dangerous to liberty, and, theiefore, to be put down, that this
Government leviathan may have the whole ground to itself
Sir, the people should caiefully examine what it ism this
pri ciple that lender  n so offensive to our Government, and
leflecthow intimately it is connected with oui whole social and
political system, ere they consent to eiadicate it, foi it will be
leaddy seen that our whole polmcal fabnc, State and Nation il,
fiom foundation comer to topmost stone, is composed of corpo
rations No assemblage of the j eople for political or other
purpose, can act or speak efficiently but by assuming many ol
the features and atiibutesol acorpoiation And, rest-ssured,
the <=ime di^toi ted viaion th«.t can perceive Jangar to the coun
try in the existence of these coiporations established lor com
meici 1 manufactu mg, and other bu>inest> purposes, will be
far more likely to di«covti it m the uutestramed right oí the
people to assemble and concentrate then power for political
objects and the next step may be the dispersion of such fac

It is allt-ged th it the e chartered rights cramp ard fetter our

resolution of one oUhetr inends, [Mir lÍAMER,]oíFered the other
day, and having this for its object? A very indefinite resolution
it was, so far as it pledged the Administration to any particular
act, still it mamta-nea a principle  ana specified a duty, aid
was, therefore, one step gained                            r       ,
That most extraord nary resoluti n deserves" particular con
sideration, as u contains the first evidence of a change of obi
nion m the Admtmstr mon ranks It is remarkabW both ibr
its admission ana its assumptions As to the first, we there jhad
it distinctly admitted, foi the first time, th tthe ilbusi7tessJcom
meice, eti dilation, and exchanges of the country* are jnat/e
rangedand embarrassed condition" There 'were lo lfsor
buts about it It was not merely the bu^ ne^s of the banks
oi meichants that *wa3 deranged, u "vvs the besnessof ihe

Sir, that gentle-r an heldeveiy diffeient docu me last fall,
when we were tij ing to show that the country was in difficulty
1 here was no embariassment then in his section The trifling
derangement of the paper currency was rather a benefit than a
disadvantage, as it enabled merchants to collect then debts and
pay banks what they owed them Ueadvised all personsoutot

expeuenced no -difficulty—had felt no embarrassment Hei
farmers liad plenty of cat,h to jinglo m tneir bilk pui&es, and

Another admission wotthy of nonce is, th u Govern menu has
something to do with the ' business commerce, circulation,
and exchanges of the count? y, ' and also ¡Í at Government

too, also, It admits tl at the bank-,, of some oi them, -it least,
weie making laudable efforts m resume specie payments And,
more than all) that is the duty of the Government to aid the
banks in this effort to íes oie the currency
But, sir, il it made some singular confeo&ions, u contained the
quite as eitiaordmary assumption that it w>is the tfesign of
the Administran n to aid the baitks in their laudable efforts to
resume Why, sn, this was too mueh of a piactit el joke ioi
even the gentleman himicli to ptrsisi in it mdhe had to era c
