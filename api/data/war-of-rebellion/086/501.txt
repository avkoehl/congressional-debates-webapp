HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Natchez, Miss., November 9, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHRISTENSEN:

General Dana sends me information that the enemy are concentrating a large force at Brookhaven and Fayette for a crushing blow upon Natchez, learning that I have but few troops, mostly colored, which is the fact - about 1,600 in all, this side the river. I want one or two good regiments of white infantry and 500 cavalry.
