gima mihtaiy land warrants, which letter was
oidi red to lie on the table
Also, a report fiom the Secretaiy ot the Tieas-
uiy,made in obedience to the oidei of the House
ot the 11th of Januaiy instant, calling for an ac
count of defalcations by receiveis and collertois
oi othu depositauis ot public money, since the
1st of Octobei, 1837, and the amount that has
bien paid, or that íemains unpaid, fiom default-
tis, is sot foi th in the íepoit of the 17th of Jan-
uaiy, 18.18 us.nloo, theconespondeiice touching
ih tulcations of receivers and collictois since the
Depailment furnished document No 297 at the
Inst si ssion of Congicss, which leport was laid
on tin  table
The report is as follows
Treasury Department,
January 28, 1839.
Sir This leport is submitted m compliance
with the fol'owmg lesolution, adopted by the
HoUbO of Ri mcstntativeb, on the 11th instant

Undet the oigamzation of this Dipaitmi nt the I
duties of the oiiiee ot Secietaiy of the Treasury j
are chiefly of an administrative characti i     The
accounting officeis aie appointed to detei mine the 1
liabilities or indebtedness of individuals to the
United States, and in settling matteis of account, j
are made, by law, independent of the Secietaiy   |
The Comptioller and Solicitor of the Tieasuiy
also causi prosecutions to be commenced for di - 1
faulters when asceitained, and henee, in answei-
lng the fiist head of inquiry, as was done in an
swenng a similar call made in October, 1837, I
have lequested the Comptioller to furnish from
his books a tabular statement of the mfoimation I
desired under the first head    That statement has
been reused by the Sohcitoi, and contains the
names, times, and amounts of the supposed "de-
falcations by receivers and collectors, or other
depositaries of the public money," which have
taken place since the 1st of October, 1837.    It is
annexed.
Fewer of these cases are likely to be mere
nominal defaults than in the other document re-
fened to, (No 111,) as that embraced a penod
of nearly half a century, and it was not possible
for the Comptioller to be acquainted critically
with many of the cases Nor does the present
resolution use the same broad language on this
subject as that of October, 1837 That called for
the names of those collecting and deposit officeis
" in default to the Government " But this re-
quests a list of all recent " defalcations" among
such agents. The fust description includes offi-
cers whose accounts are unsettled on the books
whether from accident, death of the paity, infor-
mality in vouchers, or actual indebtedness But
the latter term is usually employed in a more re-
stricted sense than the former, and generally in-
cludes only such cases as are supposed to consist
of real culpable indebtedness of public officers after
being legally required to make payment.
It is difficult for the Comptroller to discriminate
between these two classes of cases on the books,
when they are so numerous and of such long stand-
ing, and in Older to prevent misapprehension,
and a failure to give all the mfoimation which
was desired, the nominal defaults and amounts,
before as well as since October 1, 1837, have, in
both statements, been arranged by him in one
column, and the supposed amounts of the real
indebtedness, unpaid and withheld, so far as>
known in the accounting offices, have been append-
ed in notes and in anothei column of íemarks.
The amounts believed to be secured, or not due
in seveial cases, will also appear in the notes and
remarks attached to both of the statements.
The íesult of the piesent exhibit is, that since
October 1, 1837, no case of defalcation, except
that of the late collector at New York, explained
already in a special communication, is known to
have occurred among the whole number of collect-
ors of duties, amounting to moie than one hun-
died, and that only nine nominal defaults, among
neai seventy receivers, have happened, and most
of those of small amount, and all of them are be-
lieved to be well secured
2 The next inquiry is, "what amonnt has
been paid, or what balances appealing due from
defaulteis m the íepoit of the 17th January last,
1838, have been adjusted and leduced " Other
tabulai statements on this subject aie annexed,
prepared by the Comptroller, and revised by the
Solicitor. They show the amounts since paid,
and by whom, whether in full or in part; and
the fuither amounts in several cases, supposed to
be secuied. A pievious statement has been pre-
pared m the Comptroller's and Register's offices,
and sent to the Senate, in answer to a resolution
of that body, which, in each case of collectois
duties, exhibits likewise the amount of allow-
ances chimed, which aie known to have been
offeied and suspended A similai one as to re-
cen oís is in the comse of piepaiation
I Besides piopei deductions on these accounts,
it is believed, from mqjny and obseivation, that
sinu the yeai 1789 ntdi twenty per cent of the
balances in the cases of collectors and receivers
I has, by death and accidents, not been piesented
and allowed on the books, though, on a full ex-
amination, they might be with justice, weie all
the facts thoioughly known
In concluding the renarks on this branch of
the resolution, it deserves special notice, that by
the Comptioiler's statement ¡t appeals that, not-
withstanding the pitssure of the times, fiom a
third to naif a million, or §426,807, have been
collected, secuied, or reduced, in tit'le more than
a year, from the balances against this class of
officeis, who weie nominally m default pievious
to October, 1837.
Susptnded \oucheis exist against the lemain-
der to the amount of near $400,000 m the ease
of collectois, and to a large amount not yet as-
ceitained in that of receivers It would seem
also, that twenty cases out of about one hundred
and seventy in all, have been entirely paid, or
more than one ninth of the whole number, and
that seveial have, besides, been much reduced in
amount, and many otheis fully secured
The Comptroller has not consideied the de-
faults of the banks as coming withm this pait of
the lesolution, but the payments made by them
smce October, 1837, on the balances m default,
