FORT LARAMIE, August 23, 1862-2.15 p. m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

My department commander is in the field and I cannot communicate with him. Indians from Minnesota to Pike's Peak and from Salt Lake to near Fort Kearny committing many depredations. I have only about 500 troops scattered on the Telegraph and Overland Mail Lines. Horses worn by constant patrolling both roads. If I concentrate my force to go against Indians, mail line, telegraph, and public property will be destroyed. If you cannot send re- enforcements from States, will you give me authority to raise 100 mounted men in the mountains and re-enlist the Utah troops for a limited time? The

troops furnish their own horses. Answer by telegraph. We have no mails at this post. I am building new post on new mail route near Medicine Bow Mountain. Will you name it either Stanton, Halleck, Baker, or Lincoln?

JAS. CRAIG.
