Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to recommend for appointment to the position of brigadier-general, Colonel A. Buschbeck, Twenty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanding First Brigade, Steinwehr's division. For nearly two weeks he commanded a brigade near Kelly's Ford, thirty miles away from the rest of the army, in a manner most satisfactory. On the march and during the battle Colonel Buschbeck gained respect and encomium from all. More than any other officer, he, with his brigade, checked the pursuing enemy. I believe him to be a man of integrity and ability. Second. I recommend Captain H. Dilger, Battery I, First Ohio Artillery, for a lieutenant-colonelcy by brevet for gallant and meritorious conduct during the late battle. He handled his battery as well as a man could and receives my highest commendation.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS GENERAL HEINTZELMAN,May 14, 1863-11 a. m.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Commanding Middle Department, Baltimore:

Major General J. Stahel has sent out a force of 400 of the First Michigan Cavalry to try and intercept Mosby, which is all the available force we could send, and as there are 400 of the enemy reported near Leesburg and 500 near Upperville, it is not considered safe to allow them to proceed too far, and in consequence will be of little assistance to the detachment of the First New York sent out by you, as our forces are so far apart.

S. P. HEITZELMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS GENERAL SCHENCK,Baltimore, May 14, 1863.

Brigadier General W. H. MORRIS,

Harper's Ferry:

Four hundred rebel cavalry are now reported near Leesburg and 500 near Upperville. Have Colonel Schley and Captain Means keep a sharp lookout on and across the river. There may be a raid designed, but let our people beware of any vain rumors.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
