The Tariff—Mr. Mtflvaine.
H. of Reps.
■what assurance have we that Great Britain will not, in a
few-yearsfnore; with, her immense and various foreign pes*
session?, supply her entire demands i Hence, the necessity
•o£ providing, as far as possible, a home market for all our
■agricultural products. 'I his can only, be done by encourag-
ing oyr manufactures and mechanics, thereby creating a
community of consumers, as well as producer.
Every member of the community sees the operation of
this principle around him. A single mechanic—a black-
smith, a carpenter, of shoemaker-r-depends upon his- agri-
cultural neighbor for his supplies, and produces a market ftC
the extent ot his wants for the produce of the farm, and eve-
rything elsa except that which-he himself produces. It is
seen to a greater extent in a manufacturing establish-
yrtent, supporting a number of families, and it is the exten-
sion Qf'this principle which is sought and obtained by the
prQfcfection of American industry.
The agricultural interests are not less benefited by the
protection of manufactures than manufacturers themselves.
They are mutually dependent upon each other. The pro-
ducer can no more do witheut the consumer, than the con-
sumer without the producer. The manufacturer and me-
chanic may otherwise employ his capital and labor, but the
agriculturist can make no use of his land unless he have a
market for his produce.
What would the foreign market be worth if it were our
only reliance? The Value of the annual produce of the
Unfted States is Estimated at $2,000,000,000, whilst our aver-
age annual exports for the last ten years have not exceeded
$100,000,000, or one-twentieth of the gross produce, or one-
tortieth Exclusive of cotton, which constitutes one-half of
our'-aatire exports. Massachusetts alone consumes $40,-
OOQ.OOO of the produce of the other States—equal to half our
entire exports, exclusive of manufactures.
If it were not for the home market for our agricultural
produce, it must be sold, if sold at all, at whatever prices it
•would bring abroad; and as we cannot increase the foreign
demand, a glut would be the inevitable conscquencej prices
would fall, and ruin would be the end.
The gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Brinkerhoff,] to illus-
trate the perfect insignificance of the home market, produced
by our manufacturing population, tells us that the nine man-
ufacturing States, (including the great agricultural States
■of New York and Pennsylvania,) with a population of 6,761,-
082*-cdnsume'175,788,'182 bushels of grain, estimating twen-
ty-six bushels to each person, which he considers a fair es-
timate ; and that those States produce 139,788,133 bushels,
leaving only a deficiency ofSG,000,000 to be supplied by the
other States: and that Ohio and Indiana, producing 47,000,.
t>00 of bushels, can supply all their demands, and have a sur-
plus 11,000,000 of bushels. Now. sir, without stopping to
inquire into the accuracy of the"gentleman's calculation,
ana admitting that the States of Ohio and Indiana disposed of
their entire produce, suppose these nine manufacturing
States did not consume their entire produce of grain, and
the #6,000,000 besides from the other States, but had to seek
a foreign market for their produce: what would be the ef-
fect upon the gentleman's State? Does he not see that in-
stead of going abroad with 11,000,000 bushels of grain, he
would meet, m the foreign market, the surplus of the nine
manufacturing States; and as the foreign demand would not
he materially increased by the suspension of our manufac-
tures, the supply would greatly exceed the demand; and as
the relation of supply and demand is the great regulator of
prices, he would,in all probcbility, not obtain as much for
nis entire crop as is now received for his surplus of eleven
millions. But the gentleman seems to think, that because
the home market is not sufficient lor our entire produce, it is
therefore of no consequence at all, and should be broken up;
and that if we cannot all become consumers, we should
therefore all become producers. But experience and reason
teach us that the more extensive the market and varied the
pursuits of life, the more prosperous and independent are
the people.
How does the protective system operate upon commerce?
ISy manufacturing at home, what we have heretofore re-
ceived from abroad may change the nature of our imports,
but it will not diniinish our foreign commerce. Our manu-
factures require for their completion many article? which
■we do not ourselves produce, and must necessarily obtain
from abroad; and by giving profitable employment to the
people, they are enabled to consume a larger amount of for-
eign articles of luxury and comfort than they could other-
wise do. This is proved by a reference to our imports, from
which it will appear, that when domestic industry was tiest
protected, the consumption of foreign imports was greatest;
and that our foreign as well as internal commerce is mainly
regulated by the general prosperity or adversity of the peo-
ple, and not simply by the amount of duties levied in our
ports.
The amount of foreign imports consumed in the thiee years
preceding the adoption of the*arifT of 18W, was, m round

And in 1843, when duties were at their lowest
point, the amount of foreign imports con-
sumed was but •
ports will be considerably increased, and will fall little if
any short of $100,000,000. The amount of imports, it is
true, is not alone indicative of internal prosperity; but with
a stable and uniform currency, the protective system will
as certainly promote our commercial as the other great in-
terests of the eountry. The people will gratify their wants
to the extent of their means; and whatever promotes their
ability to-purchase, will inevitably increase demand. This
ability is the consequence of productive labor and the de-
velopment of our great natural resources, which enable us
to extend, profitably, our foreign as well as internal com-
mBnf the effect of protective duties is not less beneficial to
the real and legitimate 'export commerce of-the country.

Between the first and the last periods of the "compromise
act " estimated by the same rule, there is a balance m favor
of the latter period of $12,000,000, which is, however, more
than accounted for in the excess of the cotton crop in that
P<MrdCliairman, I will not attempt the comparison between
the details of this bill and the present law. The one is tried ,
and as far as experience has gone, it is found to answer all
the' necessary purposes of a revenue measure, j,and has
wrought an improvement in the business and general pros-
perity of the country unprecedented, in our history, The
other is an untried experiment. It cannot benefit any class
of the community or bection of the country, but must,, by a
substitution of ad valorem lor specific duties, and then- re-
duction to twenty-five per cent., destroy most of the great
interests of the country, beggar the treasury, involve us in
foreign debt, and make us "hewers of wood and drawers of
water" to the capitalists of Europe. . ,
But we are told that our present and growing prosperity
is in spite of, and not in consequence of. the present tariff.
Then it is at least harmless; and whilst it furnishes an
abundant revenue, and gives profitable employment to eapi*
tal and labor, it neither cripples the recuperative energies
•fthe people, nor retards the omvard progress of the nation.
But, whilst it is contended that the almost miraculous
change from deep depression to high prosperity, which has
followed the adoption of the present tarifl, is in no wise at-
tributable to that measure, no one has ventured to account ,
for it in any other way*, unless, indeed, it be the gentleman
from Louisiana, [Mr. Slidbll,] who has said that it is m
consequence of the "absence of a national bank." If this be
the cause, why did it not follow the termination of that bank,
and not the tariff of 1842, six years afterwards?
Much has been said here and elsewhere of a protective
tariff increasing prices—particularly upon articles of gen-
cral use among the mass of the people. "
Sir 1 was pleased with the aigument of the gentleman
from Maryland [Mr. Weih^kkdJ upon this subject. It can't
be dodged. There it is, and you can't get over it, or around
it or throueh it. He has shown you cassimere of his own
make for one dollar and fifty cents a yard, better than was
ever imported for the money; woollen plaids for fiom 75
cents to $2 per yard, equal to the imported at from $2 to $3;
American prints at from 12£ to 16 cents, quite as handsome
and better than the imported at 25 to 30 cents. But he might
have gone further. .
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Hudson] in his
verv able report from the Committee on Manufactures, has
given us tables of prices of difterent articles ol American
manufacture, before and since the adoption of the present
tarift', from which it appears that

Now, these and many other articles which have fallen m
like manner, all enter largely into the consumption of the
farmer, the mechanic, and the laboring man, and present an
argument in favor of the tendency of protection to reduce
prices of domestic manufactures, which all the speculative
theory of the world cannot controvert.
Gentlemen may talk about protective duties being paid by
the consumer, until the end of times but as long as the peo-
ple can buy the protected article for less money than it cost
them before the protection was given, they will make few
converts. It is theory against practice; and where they do
not agree, theory must always yield.
But the question is asked, if protection reduces prices,
how is the manufacturer benefited? The answer is, by giv-
ing permanehcy and stability to business; by excluding
inferior and spurious articles from abroad, "made to sell,
and extending the home market. Just as the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Dun.can] obtained an edition of 50,000 copieg
of his speech fot $10 per thousand, when an edition of 1,000
copies of the same speech would have cost him $12 50. The
oxtension of the market for any given article necessarily
cheapens its production.
But why withdraw this protection from the manufacturer?
If it be true, as is contended on the other side, that he alone
is benefited by protection; and it be also true, (of which
there can be no doubt,) that the protected article is not ad-
vanced in price, but cheapened to the consumer, and tkat no
other interest is injuriously affected by it, why, 1 ask,
should this industrious class of the community be broken
up? They are part and parcel of our common family;
equally liable for the support of government and the defence
of the country with the other classes, and equally entitled
to the fostering care and protection of government. And
who are they that are to take the place and enjoy the advan-
tages of these, our fellow citizens'? The manufacturer of
Europe. The proposition is to take the bread out of the
moutns of our own industrious'and enterprising citizens,
and hand it over to strangers in a foreign land. What prin-
ciple of patriotism or philanthrophy or necessity can
authorize, much less justify, such an unnatural and cruel
^Pennsylvania, the State which I in part represent, feels a
deep interest in this question of protection; not for her
manufactures alone, but as well for her agricultural inte-
rest. Her grain crop exceeds in value that of any other
State in- the Union; and according to the last census report,
amounts to upwar4s of $36,000,000 annually; whUsnrer en-
tire agricultural produce, by the same report, is $68,480,924

From which it appears that, even in the great manufactur-
ing and commercial State of Pennsylvania—third only ill the
extent of her. manufactures, and second in her commerce--
her agricultural interest doubles them both. Hence 'it is,
that the farmers and mechanics and laboring men of the
country are thundering at eur doors in opposition to this
bill. They ses that with the destruction of the manufac-
turing interest, they raust lose the only reliable market for
their vast agricultural produce. Sir, I know and feel what
I say. I am myself a farmer, and have earned my bread by
the sweat of my brow; and I know that with us the manu-
facturer is the very life-spring of agriculture, and so the
people understand it. I presented, along with many others,
a remonstrance from my own neighborhood, (in which is a
forge,) signed by more than one hundred persons, nine-
tenths of whom are farmers, mechanics, and laboring men;
and this is the character of the remonstrants generally
against any reduction of the present tariff. They are not
the "wealthy manufacturers," upon whom gentlemen have
heaped so much unmerited abuse, but tlve bone and sinew
of the country. , . - , . _
The manufacture of iron alone m Pennsylvania amounted,
in 1841, to nine and a half millions of dollars; employing
16 664 workmen, and, including their familes, supported
83 324 persons; creating a market for nearly $6,000,000 of
agricultural produce and manufactures, including about
$100 000 tobacco, besides alarge amount of sugar and nee,
to the no small benefit of our southern neighbors.
In my own district, a single county, although essentially
agricultural, there is a capital invested in manufactures, ex-
clusive of the trades, of one and a half million of dollars,
employing 2,375 workmen, and, with their famines, 9,500;
ana creating a market for agricultural produocat our very
doors to the amount of $400,000.
