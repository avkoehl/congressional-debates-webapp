numerical weight in the aggregate votes of the two Houses,
but there was another anil far more important point of view m
■which it ought to be considered He contended that practically
and m effect the veto, armed with such a qualification as now
accompanied it in the Constitution, was neither more nor leas
than an absolute power. It was virtually an unqualified nega
live on the leg'siation of Congress Not a solitary instance had
yet occuned m which the veto once exerted had ever been
overruled, nor was such a ease likely to happen In most ques
liona where the veto could be exerted, there was already a con
siderable differfence of opinion both m the country and in Con
gress as to the bill which had been passed In such circum-
stances, when all the personal influence, the official patronage,
and the reasoning which accompanied the vetp, were added to
ihe substantial weight of the veto itself, every man acquainted
with human nature would tie ready to admit, that if nothing
•could set it aside but a vote of two thuds in both Houses, it
imght as well have been made absolute at once
But Mr C was unable to dwell on this part of his subject,
being warned by his feelings of a want of physical ability to go
at large into the subject
He now, however, approached another view of it, to which he
would ask the serious and undivided attention of the Senate
The veto power professed to act only while the Legislature
acted—theie it was to terminate Its effect was to be to con-
summate legislation The officer of Government in who?e
hands the Constitution placed a power so foimidable, was sup
posed in theory to íeinam profoundly silent as to the passjge of
great measuies of public policy, until they were presented to
him ma finished form for hisappiobation and sanction This
wasthe theory; but Mr C contended that leally and m practice
this veto powei drew after it the power of initiating laws, and
m its effect must ultimately amount to conferring on the Fxecu
tive the entire legislative power of the Government With the
power to initiate and the power to consummate legislation—to
give vitality an ■) vigor to eveiy law, or to sti ike it dead at his
pleasure—the President must ult mately become the ruler of the
nation.
When members acting m their legislative capacity knew and
remembered that it was m the powei of one man to art eat them
in their legislative career, what was the natural tendency of
such a state of things? on the established principles of oui na-
ture, bow was this likely to work? Would not legislators, with
gradually less and less attention to that delicacy, íeserve and
official deference which were ever due from one department of
Government towards the other, come at length to conduit wiih
the Executive as to what law they might pass with the hope of
his approbation? Would not this be the natuial result1* Inde
pendent of all those obvious and glaring considetations which
went to show that it must, Mr C could point to numerous facts
illustrative of the position; and, if he went into them, u would
be not With a view to complain, not with a desite to levive
iormer contests, 01 to say awoidwhich might mdciy wound
the feelings of any human being But did not gentlemen lecol
lect how often during the administration of an eminent individu
al, now in private life, intimations had been given beforehand
that a certain bill would be vetoed if it weie passed? And did
they not remember various instances in which the thieat had
been fulfilled? Take the expenence of tht, last six months
Congress have passed two bills to establish a Bank of the United
States, bills in alt the provisions of which neither party con
curred, and which would not have had the concurience of
twenty men in either House had their minds been left uninflu-
enced by the expected action of the Executive Take as a spe-
cial instance the famous 16th section of one of thosfe bills Mr
<J was free to declaie that he did not know a solitary man
among those who voted foi 'he bill who would have voted foi
that section but as a measure of conciliation, and in (he h ipe
that, so modified, the bill would receive the sanction of the Pi e
sident True, that expectation was not realized, the sacn
fice was vainly made, but it had been made with a view to that
end, and that alone And so m regard to the second of those
bills That bill, as he was mfoinud, came to Congre s precise-
ly as it had leu the President's hand So anxious h )' Copgies&
beento secure the appiobition oí the Piesiutnt that, although
almostevery thing in the bill would oithei Inve been omiUeu
or amended by a majouty, they took Has it cime from the fV
«idential hand, and parsed it, letter foi lettei, at theyitcaived
It. Without going Anther, did not this faupiove that tí epos
session oí the veto power diew after it the power of initiating
laws?
Take another case m the bill now before the Judiciary Com
mittee Was there one man to be found in either House of
Congiess who would ever have proposed such a measure as the
Exchequei Board provided m that bill? Yet, what had been
the feel*rig1 Had it not been this Must we go home without
doing something? Had no* the feeling been We are bound by
the veto power, we cannot do what we would ? Had not the
teeiingbeen We mus* tike what the Executive offirs 01 get
nothing? Yes, already the idea was becoming fimilian/ert to
the minds of fteemen, to men oí only the second ¡*eneia'ion af
tei the days of the Revolution, of submitting to the diet moa of
the Executive, because without his a^pnr, they coi Id worn

Then, tí enable a naaon of fieemen to cany out then wi!',
to set Congress free to sptak that will, to mfifss the wrongs
and to supply the wants of those that -ent them Mr 0 aenm
declared that the veto powet must be modified and resuained
If not, the question which Congre-s would have to decide
would be, not what is the propei íemcdv f >r the existing griev
anees of the country, not what will íestore the national pins
perify—no, but what measure will be sanctioned b> the Chief
Minístrate
Mr C said that, as he had not the bodily s rensrh to dwell
more at large on the genera! subject, he would now proceed to
examine the objections wmch were urged against any fuithei
restrictions on this Executive power
There had gotten up a notion of late years that some curb
was necessary upon the power of majorities, and that without
this the safety of the country must be iu danger Now on what
grounds had the principle been founded that in a free Govern-
ment the majority must goyernl  On two grgunds.   The first
eONtíRESSIÓNAL £LÓB1.
was of an intellectual and moral character It was right thatin
a great public, political partneiship, the greater number should
be satisfied with what was done, and that there was a greater
chance of wisdom in complying with the will of the greater ,
number Onthescore of chances some mustgovern; and who
should it be? Themmority? Why? Because they possessed
more wisdom? Why were they likely to possess more wisdom11
The second ground was physical in its aspect—it held that the
majority should be allowed to govern, because they would go
sern, having the physical force which would enable them to
carry out then wih Now this doctrine that minorities must
govern, whether with or without the veto, was advanced by
gentlemen who professed and called themselves members of the
JefTersonian school But what was the doctrine of Mi Jefferson
himself in resard to majorities, and so declared by him foi ty
years ago? [Here Mr C read an extract from Jefferson's woiks,
in which it was bi oadly laid downthat an absolute acquiescence
in the will of majonties was necessary in a free Republican Go
vernment ]
But there were some par lcular interests, and one especially,
in regard to which the South feltgreatsohcitude, which it was
supposed would be more safe under the continuance of the veto
power than without it Now, in the fiist place, Mr C saw no
difference m respect to safety between that paiticular m'erest
and o'her interests of the country If it was true that any one
interest would be more secure under the veto power than with
out it then all interests would be more tecure, but if no security
•a as produced by the veto, then that particular interest would not
be more se me by the veto Just as well might gentlemen from
the North use up and say that the navigating interest (m regard
to which they wei e perhaps more inteiested) would be more se
cureundei the veto power, or the friends of any intei est, North
prn, Southern or Western, might fancy that it would be moie
secuie But the oiiesnon came at last to this is the veto a ne-
cessary power, or is ltnot? If ins necessary, it ifanecessary to
all, if not, it is necessary to none.
What was the security which the South would possess in
this veto power'' Sooner or later the Ptesident would be in a
majority himself But, if a majority of Congress should put it
self m opposmon to the inteiest of the South, neither Presidents
nor vetses would avail to protect it Its own resolution, its own
valor, its own indomitable determination to maintain its rights
against all men these and these alone could m that case uphold
Southern interests.
Meanwhile,the people of the Soulhhadall requisite guar
antees Fast, they had the sacred provisions of the Constitu
turn, and then they had the character of our Government as a
Confedeiac>—the ex stence of these interests long before the
aloption of the Constitution, and the rights and duties of the
Government in regard them lecognised and laid down by that
sacred instrument That was the security of the South. As
one who hiri elfh\ed wheie that peculiar interest existed, he
possessed no security from the existence of the veto power—
nono—none whatever He felt himself secure in that mutual
harmony which it was abkethe interest of all to cultivate, in
the constitutional securities, and in the certainty of the disrup
tion of the Union, as the inevitable result, the moment that in
terest should be assailed, in the capacity and determination of
the South to defend herselt at allhazaids, and against all forms
of attack, whether fiom abioirl or at home Theie, there was
the security, and i ot in thi& miserable despotic veto power of
the President of the United States
Mr C wenton tosay, that the amendment which hehadhad
♦he honor of piepo«ing to he Senate was encountered by aigu-
ments which weie directly opposed to each other He was
told by one that this power was a sacred thing, not lightly to
be touched, but to be hel I m honoi and veneration as th^ choi
cest le^aCy left u-, by our ancestors He was told, on the otlu r
hand, by an honorable friend in Ins eye, that the amei dment
wasva.n, becauseit was a thing impossible evei to get the
Constitution amended Headmittelthat it was a thing ex
tremely difficult returning as it did the concurrence of
eish'etn States But now, in reply to the first argument,
tho^o who regaided the Constitution as sowoithy of pieser
vatmn, should he satisfied that no light and trivial amendment
to it ever could be can ltd into effUt, but if they weie con
vmce f that anv amendment would be for the good of the coun
try, it wa" then duty to put it foith and submit it to public
will As to tht second argument, he admitted, as he had
said, its full foi ce It was ndeed extremely doubtful whether
any gentleman hero pin ent would ever live to see the Con
btitution amende I, huts ill it was thp uty of pvery fuend of
his country ti u<=e proper efforts to have it improved One
attempt only had succeeded since those alteiations were
adopted which took place immediately after the adoption of
the Constitution itself But this subject had been a good deal
consideied in the countiy, and if Mr C. had been successful
in any deeiee in demonstrating it& expediency, neitht-i clobs of
objt-ctor* oushtto por^eveie in opposing it
As to another amendment, which had reference to the ap
poirtment of the Secretary of the Tieasuiy and the Tiea^-urer
of the United StaU«, Mr C adn 'ted that if his friend fiom
Vn gim i ["\li Ai cher] could succeed in establishing what Mi
C had at'empted ytais aero to demonstrate—that Congiess did
poc e&s the constitutional power to define the tenure of office,
and todtfeid itagains thp power ofdnmiosion—there would
to b° *nre, be .ess nece^Mtv for making a special provision in
in r aiu\ to these two onVtr^ But still, for, gieater steur¡*y,
Mr ( sh* ti'd prefer to have the appomtmentof the Trea
surer and tn jSecieaiy explicit1} placed in thehanosol Con
eres 
Mr C ob-eived thaf tf ihei^ wa-s any «¡entimcnt m relation
to publicdfldiis on which the people of tins countiy had made
up then mind, uwas in regaid to thenece^ity of limiting Exe
cutive power Its present overgrown character hid long been
viewed by * lem with apprehension The power w i° not peí
snnal—it was not mainly ofix lal You mifht take a mechanic
fiom the venue ?nd make mm Piesident and he would be in
stantly sunounded with power and influence the oowei and
the influence of li s effice It was very true that the pei^oml
popular ty of an incumbent might add much to his powei but
the powei itself was official not personal and its danger aro<-e
fiom itstendercyanJ ability to accumulate This wa.-. demon
strated by all pa-t histoiy, and was witnessed by all we saw
around us All these considerations called upon Senators m'
the lanírus^e of patrio ism deeply to leflect on the conse
rjuencps which might ensue should nota power so great m it
self and so piona to increase be subjected to some salutary
limitation
Let not sertlempn deceive themselves by names    The un-
pretending name President of the United States was no secan
ty against the extent or the abuse of power The power as-
signed to a public individual did not depend on the title he
might bear the danger arose not from his name, but fiom the
quantum of power afhis command Whether he were called
Emperor, Dictator, King, Liberator, Protector, Sultan, or Pre-
sident of the United States, was of no consequence at all Look
athis power that was what we had to guard against The
most tremendous power known to antiquity was the shortest
in its duration It was not then m duration, any more than
in title, that the danger lay, but in the magnitude of the power.
This called for every safeguard The Dictatorship of Rome
continued but for a brief period, yet, while it lasted, the whole
State was m his bauds He did whatevei he pleased, whether
with life, liberty, or property We had, then, no security against
the power of the Piesldent of the United States in the shortness
of the term for which he was chosen
We often found very pathetic reflections in the writings of
scholars on the sad condition of kings—on the isolation of their
thrones—on the effect of their station in removing them from
the body of society, whf re no voice could reach them but the
voice of flatterers, and wnere they were perpetually surrounded
by the incense of adulation, and the chief ground of sympathy-
seemed tobe the impossibility that truth should reach then ears.
It might be said that this was ti ue of kings, but did not apply on
this side of the water but let Mr C tell those who thought so,
that the actual condition of á President of the United States did
not veiy widely differ f'om that of the monarchs of the old world.
Here, too, the Chief Magistrate occupied an isolated station,
where the voice of his country and the cries of its distresscould
not reach his ear He, too, was surrounded by a cordon of fa-
vorite1', flattereib, and 'awns Isolated m this D strict, with no
embossments himself, ¡1 p echoes ot the public distress, if
the^lRchedhiseai atall,reached it with a faint and feeble sound,
being obstructed bv those who surrounded his person, and ap-
proached him only to flatter. Facts were boldly denied, and all
complamtsattubuted to a factions spirit Now, he would ask,
was a man thus separated, pnd thus surrounded, more likely to
know the ieal suffeung^, wants, and wishes of his countrymen,
than the two bundred and foity two men m the other House,
or the fifty two men in this Hou=>e, who came up here directly
from their bosom í who shared in all their suffering? who feft
theirwants, participated in their wishes, and sympathized in
all their sorrows'* That was the true question of the veto power.
Now he thought if these things weie duly considered, (and he
spoke not of this ot of th it incumbent of the office, but of the
circumstances of every one who filled it ) it must be admitted
by every candid mind that the responsibility was great of a man
who should undertake, on his own private opinion, to resist and
suppress the will of the nation constitutionally expressed It
was a powei not merely to annul the national will, as lawfully
uttered by its own chosen Representatives, but the power to
initiate legislation itself, and to substitute for the will of the na-
tion an alien will, neithei of the nation nor of its Representa-
tives
But he was physically unable to go further in o this subject.
The que&Mon wa& the eld quc3fon whether we should have, m
this countiy, a power tyianmcal,despotic, absolute, the exer-
cise of Which must, sooner or later, pioduce an absorte despo-
tism, or a fiee Representative government with powers clearly
defined and caiefully sepaLated'i That was the true queston
to be decided
There were other amendments accompanying this on
which he wished to say a few woids, but was to day unable to
do so
[Several offers had been made by gentlemen near him to
move fan ¿adjournment, but he had persevered in declining
them ]
That m relation to securing to Congress the appointment of
the Secretaiy and Tieasuier, was one of those refoimstOjWhich
he con^ideied the Whig puty ¡solemnly pledged as one of the
measures proper to btpuitued in the piocees of limiting Exe-
cutivepower, but he cou'd not now dweil upon it
The other, relating to the appointment of members of Con-
gress to office, only went, in effect, to carry out the principle
already sanctioned by that article of the Constitution which de-
clares that no member should be appointed to an office which,
hdd betn created or the emoluments of which had been m-
creaspd with his concurrence This went one step further, and
declared that no membei should be appointed to an office which
had been crea edwithot without his concurrence, before or after
he was a me mber Whenever a man accepted an office which he
was reasonably expected to hold for a definite term, he should
continue to hold it ¿for that entire period, unless some very
btronsr i eason existed to the contrary, and which had not existed
pi mr to his appointment
There was one concluding remark on the amendment at
presentbefore the Senatewith which he would close what he
bad now to say Although he admitted that the pimcrples he
had laid down would, if c in ted fairly out, lead to the abolition
Of the veto altogethei, a« inconsistent with the fundamental
axiom ot fiee government yet he was of < pinion that this, like
othei re'orms,should be mtioduced slowly and wnh riuiim-
spection without &udden]y rii^hirff fiom one e\tfr"e to ano-
ther Before the powei should be utteily abo shed, he deemed
it piudenttnatan eAptntnent ¡pfiouid be made in a modified
form, and instead of lequirins amajon y of two third* ol both
Houses to supei^edc the \eto of ti e President, he thought it
sufficient to requne the concitirence oí a najouty of the whole
numhei of menibeis electe !, i e of Imy^evenm the Senate
and of one hundied and fort) * wo 11 the other House
He asked whetnei this wou id not aff rd a sufficient security
aeain^t thedansrub ofhastv legi&latinr, and in confirmation of
its sufficiency, hew mid i¡ peal to what had been the experi-
ence of all tne Sta ts ndiere =nch a ptovision had been adopted.
Il a bill, aftei having1 undeigone a full investigation and discus-
sion, should ¡ nss b )tb JTousp-- nod be transmitted to the Presi-
dent for his sign.atuie,an i be sroiíícl ictuin it with his veto, and

and fully discu beJw view of the objections urged against it by
the Executive (to say nothing of the whole influence derived
fiomhib office and all that pertained to it,) and still there
should be found a clear majority, not of a quorum piebcnf, but
of the total number of members cl'0=en by the people was not
the presumption irresistiole that the bui ought to become a law?
Surely, surely, this was a sufficient evidence of the will of the
people, and an abundant safpguaid against the hazardous con-
sequence^ of hasty and ill advised legislation
Mr PRESS ON said that, during the late Presiden'ial con
test, this subfect had been brought before the people, and, as he
could not coincide with the views in referpncp to the veto
power, expresseu by the great leader of the party to which he
