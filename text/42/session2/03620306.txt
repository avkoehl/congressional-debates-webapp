Ho. of Reps.
The Tarffl—Mr. Kelley.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
With your immense inilucnee in tl\e House,! wish j
you could he induced to aid in having this foolish, |
annoying, unjust stamp tax wholly removed. X am i
cert.iin. my dear sir, you could do nothing more '
acceptable toyoureonstituent? and friendsthrough-
out the country.
Very respectfully,
JAMES It. SICUOPS.
Hon. N. P. Banks.
Mr. Chairman, I hold in my hand a hnokenn-
1 taining the daily entries of a pawnbroker, upon
every one of whose tickets the internal revenue
laws impose a five-cent tax. Oh, what a har-
rowing chapter is here of the story of the poor
and ine way their "luxury" of pawning tbeir
rmder-garments ami their over-coats to procure
fond or medieme is taxed! Referring to this
record, which was produced before the com-
mittee, I find that Cornelius Gilbert, on black
cloth coat, pants, and vest, got thirty-nine
cents, and pa'.d the Government only five cents
for the luxury. Rachel Thomas, for a "black
cloth circular," got six cents, and paid the
Government for that luxury five cents. Mary
Minmch obtained on a Stella shawl eighteen
cents. Ah hough the other poor creature had
paid five cents tax for the luxury of borrowing
six cents, this one paid only five for the greater
luxury of borrowing eighteen!
Now, it. may be said that both bills propose
to repeal this tax. Yes, sir; but when that
record was brought to tlje attention of the
Committee of Ways and Meaps vye were hor-
rified at the thought that we had been impos
ing such taxes. And who can tell how many
more oppressions of that kind we are main-
taining among the voiceless poor under this
system of internal taxes? I epflnot guess, and
I fear that no man can tell.
Having shown the effect of our reduction of
the duty on pig iron, let me illustrate the effect
of a reduction of the duty upon copper in Eng-
land. I have before me a table showing the
production of copper in England, upon which
my friend from Indiana [Mr. Kebr] and the
majority of the committee propose to reduce
the duty.
But, by the way, while I was seated just now
1 was asked whether thechairman of the com-
mittee was not responsible for this bill. I
answer, that in my judgment he is not; he does
but act as the accoucheur to the deformity.
He assumes nothing in the way of paternal or
parental responsibility.
Mr. DAWES. My friend manifests an undue
anxiety about my relations to this bill. I
think after the statements I have made there
is no occasion for so much discussion about
it. I reported the bill under the statements
which I made at the time; I adhere with
strict fidelity to the bill. I have the privilege
Production of copper in Great Britain.
of offering amendments to it, and I believe that
a majority of the House will adopt those
amendments. After they are adopted, I shall
support the bill.
Mr. KELLEY. I did not mean to embar-
rass my excellent friend, the chairman of the
committee, but the question having been put
to me, I thought I would answer it, at least as
I understood his position, and I do not think
that his statement materially qualifies mine.
But to return to the subject of copper, in
1848 England, according to the New Ameri-
can Cyclopedia, produced from her mines
£795,582 sterling worth of copper, and the pro-
duction increased until it got to be in 1862
£1,493,241 sterling worth. She then threw her
ports open to the surface ores of Peru and
Chili, and brought her copper miners, whose
wages were but £3 6s. per month in Cornwall,
and£3 7s. in Devonshire, into competition with
the peon labor of those countries. Low as
these wages were, what was the result? 1 find,
by reference to McCulloch's Dictionary of
Commerce, that for the year 1869 her produc-
tion had fallen to £664,060 sterling. She
cheapened copper, but she closed her copper
mines and drove the miners and their fami-
lies into pauperism or emigration. Those who
would study the details of the story will find
them in the following compilation:

The New American Cyclopedia, from which
the foregoing table is taken, states that the
increase in tlie value of the production of the
mines of Corn wall and Devonshire during the
ten years preceding 1S58, had been fifty-four
per cent., and that the average rate of monthly
wages per miner in 1855 had been, as I have
said, iu Cornwall £3 Gs. and in Devonshire
£8 7s.
But low as these wages were, those of the
peons of Peru were still lower, and free trade
was soon to reverse this prosperity, render
most of the mines valueless by closing them,
and then to reduce the mipers to pauperism or
flight from their country. How rapitjly these
processes were is shown by the following
table, to be found iu HcCulloch's Dictionary
of Commerce:
Production of copper for five years ending 1866.

Mr. Chairman, I have not been able to pur
sue the decline of the production of copper
from the mines ot Great Britain further, with
the same minuteness of detail. But the States-
man's Ycu'-.Bnok for 1872 gives the value of
the, to!al annual production as follows:
1867 £831,761
l«o8  781.602
3889  641.055
in view of these tacts may I not inquire of
gentlemen whether it would be well that the iron
mines ot Indiana, Kentucky, and other States,
and the copper and iron mines of Virginia,
Tennessee, Alabama, Wisconsin, and Michi-
gan, and other States and Territories, should
be closed, and their laborers turned adrift in
order to enable us to buy iron and copper a
small percentage cheaper per pound? Yet
that is the proposition involved in the pro-
posed reduction of our duties on iron and
copper. The result of establishing free trade
in copper iu England has been to raise the
cost there so that copper is nearly as high as
here.
Mr. Chairman, it is said that we are not
e xporting as largely as we ought; that we
do not, for instance, export as many shoes as
we did in 1860, But, sir, will any gentleman
rise and say that we do not produce as many?
Will apy gentleman depy that production has
increased more than one hundred per cent, and
far more rapidly than population ? If we do not
export them and do produce them, whatdo the
facts prove? Why they prove that our people
are now so much more prosperous than they
were in 1860 that they can consume at Amer-
ican prices all that we can produce by improved
methods.
On this subject I propose to answer all con-
testants, once for all. Mr. Wells, to whom I
have referred, and who in the American Quar-
terly forlast July paraded all these figures in the
same sophistical way as gentlemen have exhib-
ited them in their recent speeches. Thanks to
the kindness of my colleague on the commit-
tee from the Oneida district of New York,
[Mr. Roberts,] I have before me a table that
answers all comers on that point. It is a state-
ment from the Census Bureau of the aggre-
gate value of manufactures in 1850, I860, and
1870. Before referring to it more particularly
I request gentlemen to take note of the fact
that in the tables for 1850 and 1800 are also
included the productions of mines and fish-
eries, while in the table for 1870the productions
of mines and fisheries are excluded. Now, sir,
let us see how the production of manufactures
during the last decade compares with that of
manufactures, mines, and fisheries for the pre-
ceding decade.
In 1850 the joint production was $1,019,-
106,616, and in 1860 it was $1,885,861,670, ini
increase of eighty-five per cent. In 1870, after
a decade five years of which had been spent in
desolating war, the former decade having been
one of peace and one which free-traders and
revenue reformers claim to have been one of
