MURFREESBOROUGH, December 7, 1862

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

Sixty thousand * Federals at Nashville; forty thousand on railroad and in Kentucky . To send south would lose Tennessee and greatly disorganize this army. Only route south (railroad) would take at least a month. Holmes can arrive much sooner. Will no send south unless ordered. I shall go to Mississippi in a few days.
