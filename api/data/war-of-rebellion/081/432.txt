CITY POINT, VA., June 26, 1864-9 a.m. [Received 10.15 a.m. 26th.]

Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

Your dispatch of 11.30 a.m. yesterday was received by me at 9.10 p.m. The only ocean steamers in this river are the C. Thomas, Suwanee, Rebecca, Barton, and Ellen S. Terry. I have given them the order you directed. They can carry an average of 600 men.

To this list will probably be added the Spaulding. He will report direct to you what they will carry. I do not know. I think that some of them are still laden with forage and subsistence.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster.

Report to General Meigs and myself the number you so order. Part if not of those that are laden should have their cargoes discharged at the proper places, and also ordered to New Orleans.

Acting Surgeon-General, Washington:

There are now over 6,000 patients in hospital encampment at City Point. All are, I believe, cases for general hospital, and should be removed promptly. The weather is exceedingly hot, and accommodation inadequate to their condition. All tents are in use that can be procured. The unsuitableness of the New World for hospital purposes, the delay of other steamers for repair, the interval between long trips to Philadelphia and New York, make it imperative that additional transports be supplied and speedily, especially as a battle may be expected at any
