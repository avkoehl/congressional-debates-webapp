as to what portion of the city these officers are now confined. If this question cannot be answered for military reasons, will you inform me of the degree of exposure to which they are subjected; whether in the part of the city most, or in that least, exposed, or that exposed in a medium degree. I would also request you to allow one general officer and one field officer of the said prisoners to subscribe to and send me a statement giving me the kind and quantity of food dealt out to them, also the comforts afforded them in the way of beds, bedding, blankets, &amp;c. The object of these requests is simply to ascertain the exact manner in which these officers are treated, that I may treat in the same manner a like number of your officer now confined in Charleston. I have not yet placed your prisoners in a similar position of exposure.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, July 4,1 864.

Brigadier Gens. T. SEYMOUR, H. W. WESSELLS, C. A. HECKMAN, E. P. SCAMMON, AND ALEXANDER SHALER:

MY DEAR FRIENDS: I have received your letter of the 1st instant, and will observe your wishes in the treatment of the prisoners now placed in my hands. We all regret very much the circumstances of your being placed under our fire in Charleston, and every one feels justly indignant at this barbarous treatment of prisoners of war. I will endeavor to have your wants supplied as far as possible, and have requested the Sanitary Commission to forward what articles they have on hand suited to your necessities. I believe your exchange might be effected, rank for rank, provided as a first step General Jones should relieve you from your position of exposure to fire.

Very respectfully and truly, your,J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
