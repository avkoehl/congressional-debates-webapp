DEVALL'S BLUFF, June 13, 1864.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR:

Mr. Wild and other citizens report a party of guerrillas, about 200, 15 miles northeast of here. Twenty-five camp within 5 miles of the river to-day. Shelby is said to have been at Cotton Plan on Thursday, and from what I can learn I think he is going, or has gone, to Clarendon.

Colonel, Commanding.
