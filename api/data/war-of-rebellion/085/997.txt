HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Camden, October 10, 1864.

Major-General WHARTON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to state that he has received information that the enemy has retired from Monticello, and as it is reported by Colonel A. J. McNeill that the column which made an attack on him at Mount Elba came up the Monticello road it is presumed that this was the same force. Under these circumstances the recent orders given in regard to Parsons' command and Hardeman's brigade are revoked. Parsons' brigade will proceed as formerly directed to Warren and relieve Colonel Harrison's brigade from that point. As soon as relieved Colonel Harrison's brigade will proceed to Alexandria, as formerly instructed. You will carry out the instructions given in regard to Hardeman's brigade in letter of 8th from these headquarters received by you on Sunday morning, the 9th, at 8 o'clock, near Magnolia. As soon as the proper dispositions are made under those orders the major-general commanding desires you to meet him at this place. He expects you in a day or two at least.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. P. TURNER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
