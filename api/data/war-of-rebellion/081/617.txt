General R. S. FORSTER,

Jones' Neck:

How would you like the command of the Third Division (colored) of the Eighteenth Corps?

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 3, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

GENERAL: I am very thankful to you for your kind consideration, but do [not] desire to command colored troops exclusively. I assumed command of this brigade because I was assigned to it, but think I was justly entitled to the command of a division on the Tenth Corps before my junior, unless some fault was found eighth my military capacity.

With assurances of high consideration, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. FORSTER,

Brigadier-General.

General SMITH:

Have you a 10-inch mortar in position to reach Petersburg? I shall have to-morrow sixty shells filled with an incendiary composition that you can try. I have tried the experiment, and think it a success. I have mounted a 13-inch mortar on a rail-car fitted for the purpose, which will reach City Point to-morrow morning. It works beautifully; recoils on the carriage three inches, on the rail track (free) twelve feet. Have mounted a 30-pounder Parrott on another car, protected by cover bullet and canister proof; this is on a navy carriage. Will be up Tuesday. Have 6,000 8-inch mortar shells at Bermuda; more coming. If you have the 10-inch mortar, will be over to witness firing to-morrow evening. Have sent for combustibles to fill 13-inch shells.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, July 3, 1864.

General BUTLER:

Have no 10-inch mortar, but plenty of room for them.

WM. F. SMITH,Major-General.
