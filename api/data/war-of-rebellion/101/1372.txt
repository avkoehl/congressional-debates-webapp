Major General S. B. MAXEY,

Commanding District of Indian Territory:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 25th ultimo, and desires me to say he regrets you do not see "any particular service you can be here (there) longer. " Your duties as an administrative officer are very extensive, and the manner in which you have conducted those duties has done credit to yourself and been a source of great satisfaction to him. The necessities of the service may at any time strip one district of its best troops and throw the mass of troops into another district, but this should not interfere with the administrative duties connected with a district.
