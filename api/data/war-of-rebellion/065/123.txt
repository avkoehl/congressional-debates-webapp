CHARLESTON, S. C., July 10, 1864-7 p. m.

Yesterday morning Brigadier-General Robertson attached enemy on John's Island, near the Stono, and drove them from first position, with loss to us of over 100 killed and wounded. Last night and this morning enemy fell back to their transports near Legareville and passed over the James and Morris Islands. Two monitors and several gun-boats still in Stono, but have been driven by our batteries beyond effective range. One monitor believed seriously damaged by sot from one of our Brooke guns. Movements this evening indicate purpose to change point of attack. From prisoners [and] manuscript captured it appears that the force now operating against this place comprises all the available force on South Atlantic coast. Bombardment of Fort Sumter has been very heavy for several days and continues so.

The enemy in barges attacked Battery Simkins, near Fort Johnson, last night and were repulsed. The fleet on the Stono has dropped drown below Battery Island. The force operating against this place since the 2nd instant sailed from Hilton Head on the 1st, and composes three brigades, viz, Hatch's, Birney's, and Saxton's, and the force heretofore on Morris, Folly, and adjacent islands, Major-General Foster commanding in person. This I get from his confidential order, taken from one of his colonels in the field.

Special Orders, Numbers 89, from your office, orders Fifty-fifth Georgia Regiment from Johnson's army to Savannah. I presume the Sixty-fifth was meant, as the Fifty-fifth is not with Johnston. Can you not correct the error and order the Sixty-fifth to me? In consequence of enemy's attack I have 300 of the Fourth Georgia Cavalry here dismounted; their horses sent to Atlanta. Enemy has made no attack here since my last. I think they will try at some other point of my lines.
