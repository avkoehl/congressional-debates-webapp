This report is a general summary of the operations of General Steele's command, commencing with the organizations of the expeditionary force at Helena, and ending with the capture of Little Rock. As soon as General Steele's more detailed report shall be received, I will forward it, with such recommendations as individual merit and services shall seen to have justified.

General Steel's operations have been conducted with marked skill and good judgment, and the importance of his success can hardly be overestimated.

My troops at Fort Smith have already opened communication with Little Rock. All Arkansas and the Indian country west of it are virtually in our possession. Our troops are cordially welcomed by a large proportion of the Arkansas people.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
