racter he might «say was that alluded to hy the Se-
nator from Missouri, Mexico only became an in-
dependent nation in 1824, while the claim of Chou-
teau and others originated many years before, when
Mexico was a province of Spain That demand
ought, therefore, rather to have been pressed at
Madrid than at Mexico Where was the injury to
accrue from a spirit of forbearance' Had we not
waited with Prance, with Spam, with Naples, and
with Holland1*
If the present were a suitable and proper time to
go into this subject, it would only be necessary for
him to advert to the correspondence to establish all
he had said Had not the clerk, Greenhow, been
sent to Mexico, with instructions that, if an answer
was, not given within ten days, he should return
back again' Well, what did Mexico do? Why,
the Secretary of State proceeded with as much de-
spatch as ministers usually do, and mstiuctions
were made out to the Mexican Minister here, show-
ing that the claims were undergoing revision, and
that fouiteen of them had already been examined,
and while the rest were yet in progress, the Presi-
dent of the United States throw-, the whole mattei
upon Congress. The demand was such, in the
first place, as no power, having a proper respect
for itself, would have permitted, and in. the second,
would not have been complied with, because much
of the evidence bearing upon these claims was at
Vera Cruz, and other places distant from Mexico.
He [Mr C ] would repeat what he had before ob-
served, that he iv as as ready as ary man m the
nation to exact justice, and to vindicate the honor
andthegloiy of the country With respect to the
affair of the steamboat, it was not before us at pre-
sent. It had not been communicated to us m an
official shape, and he treiefore thought it would be
premature to mix up that affaii with the other mat-
ters, to excite angrj feelings tor the purpose of pie-
c pitatmg us, at a time when the Treasuiy was
e npty, with so weak and impotent a power as
that of Mexico.
Mr. BENTON would make a single rem 11k in
relation to the claim ot Mi Chotonu and others, as
he had alluded to that peculiar case of tyranny and
injustice on the part ot the Spanish authouties.
The depredation on the propeity oi these American
cm/ens «as committed in 1817, pending the revo-
lution which eventuated m their independence of
Mexico, it was committed, too, by the local autho-
rities, and no doubt could be entertained that Mexi-
co was responsible for the wrong, by the law ol
nations
Mr WALKER said he merely rcc to give no-
tice that, il no report were made in regaid to our
relations with Mexico, within a short peiiod, either
in the Senate or the House ol Representatives, he
would move a íesolution to test the sense of the
Senate upon this subject
Mi BUCHANAN was eUiemely sony to pro-
long this unprofitable discussion, and he did not
care how soon the Senator from Mississippi intro-
duced his resolution Had any person heie inti-
mated that, under the Constitution, the Senate
could not originate a war neastire1 Certainty not
It did not follow, however, that it was our duty to
do etery thing which we had the power todo,
without regard to propnety or expediency, and m
a case ot this kind, he thought theie was great pro-
priety, as well as expediency, m leaving the intro-
duction of any coercivt measure to the House of
Representatives They cane immediately fiom
tne people, and returned sooner to the people to
give an account of then conduct Besides, they,
and they a'one, could ongi idle the revenue bills,
by means of which war was to be conducted
Any attempt on oui pait impropeily to hurry them,
or to censure their delay, mignt arouse feelings
which «oild retud, rather than accelerate, their
action He should be glad the Senator from
Mississippi would mt oduce his resolution, and
take a vote of tke Senate upon the question
A few words m reply to the Senator from Ken-
tucky So far as he had stated the question, he
had stated it correctly, but he had commenced at
the conclusion, and it was proper that the Senate
and the country should understand the origin and
progress of oar existing difficulties with Mexico
He admitted that if the late demand upon that Go.
vernment foi justice to our citizens had been the
first which was ever made, it would have been
pretty prompt and energetic But this was far
from being the case Our citizens had for many
vears been suffering repeated and aggravated inju-
ries from Mexico, without any pretext or apology
whatever, unless it might be found in the fact that,
during almost the whole period of its existence, the
Government of that country had been m a revolu
tionary stat . It might be true that some of our
claims were not well founded, but there were man)
others of the justice of which theie could not be a
doubt If any Senator would take 'he trouble of
reading all the documents, he would find that
redress had been over and over again de-
manded, and this Government had been put eff,
year after year, under the pretence that further
time was necessary to collect proofs, and other rea-
sons equally frivolous Of all these claims, redress
had not been obtained, according to his recollec-
tion, m a single instance, and to all human appeai-
ance we were now as far from it as ever. After
having forebome, on account of out friendly feel-
ings towaidsa sistei republic, unid forbearance was
no longer a virtue, General Jackson ¡>ent a message
to Congress, at the last regular session, recommend-
ing reprisals upon a cont ngency with the nature of
which he need not now detain the Senate The sub-
ject was reftrred to the Committee on Foreign Re-
lation^,and,uponevamiiung Ihe lieaiv v uhMevieo,
they found that, befo1"! leprisa's could be resulted
to, anolhei and mote firmal demand must be made
m the manner pievribed by one of the articles of
that treaty It «as the tone and manner of this
last demand, and the shoit time allowed for an an-
swei, of which the Senator from Kentucky had
complained In his, Mr B's opinion, this article
of the treaty, which required the last demand, ?nd
specified the form, was exceedingly impolitic and
unwise, a mmrk which he thought might be made
with justice, in írgard to several piovisions
in our modern tieatics Had it not been foi this
article, theie was no leason, eilhei in just ce or m
the l'w of nations, why we might not have resorted
to coercive mensmes without iny such lonnal pio-
ceeding Demands had been made pieviously,
again and again, for many jears, without the
slightest success, unless vie might except the case
in which a Mexican officer was removed from his
stilion for aprons insult to our flag, but was re warded
a shoit time aiterwaids by being elevated to a
higher station
A state of things now existed m regard to Mexico
requiring the most piompt and energetic action If
something sh. mid not -^oon be done to bring that
Government lo reason, our con mcrcial intercom«e
with them, secured by the fauh of treaties, mu t be
abandoned He had been a^smed, from authon'y
on which he r< 'ied, that neither the American name,
nor the Ameno n flag, was any piotection to Ame-
rican cili/ens in Mexico They were rapidly leav-
ing that country, wheie they had a right to engage
in lawful trade, having in vain appea'ed to the Go-
vernment of then own country for protection
American citizens were nowafiaid to go to Mexico
at all
Mr B believed that the most piompt and ener-
getic measures had nor become necessary, and
that a icsort to them w mid be the most certa n
means of ivoidins war lie could not agiee vviti
the ¡benatoi fiom Kentucky thit my considerations,
as to thedeianged state of our paper currency,
should be t iken into view m deciding tin ques-
tion If the national honor demanded v indication,
he could not consent thai we should be arrested
by the present state of the Treasury This hule
cloud, Mr B said, would soon pass av av, and
the boundless resouices of our country were }et
unimpaired The Senator from Ksntutlv him-
self, unless he had greatly mistaken his char?c*er,
would be one of the last men to suffer the 11 g
of his country to be outraged, and die pr< ¡ ertj of
our citizens plundered with impu ntj, merely be-
cause the banks had suspended specie payments
Milluns to defend our rights, but nata cent for
tribute.
Mr. GRUNDY rose, and observed that, as the
Graduation bill was about to be taken up, he
wished gentlemen interested id it to =make as much
progress with it as in their power, and, if possible,
terminate the discussion on it before the end of the
week, as he should feel it to be his duty to ask the
Senafe on Monday next to take up the bill to pro-
hibit the issuing and circulating the bills and notes >
of the old United States Bank
PUBLIC LANDS
The Senate resumed the consideration of the bul
to provide for the graduation and reduction of the
puce of the public lands, when
Mr CLAY of Ky addressed the Senate at some
length in opposition to the bill.
Mr GHUNDV then lose and submitted an
amendment, to nndei the bill as already amended
bj him moie pet fed, and to do away with the pos-
sibility of a misconstruction of it, i e to make n_
operate on'j on lands that have l^en offered at
public sale
Aftei some lenar's írom Messis CLAY of
Alabama, CLAY or Kentucky, and GRUNDY,
the amendment w as agreed to
After the consideration of executive budines,
The Senate adjourned.
