AUGUST 17, 1862.-Reconnaissance toward Forge Bridge.

Report of Lieutenant Colonel William T. Martin, Jeff. Davis Legion.

WHITE OAK SWAMP, VA., August 17, 1862.

GENERAL: Lieutenant Waring, who, with 12 men, was detailed to make the reconnaissance your ordered toward Forge Bridge, has just returned. He went within a mile of the bridge and found his farther progress checked by the presence of the enemy's forces. The negroes and women (all the while men citizens had been arrested or had run away) all concurred in representing that the enemy was steadily passing down on the New Kent road, which turns to the right half a mile beyond Forge Bridge. There seems to be no doubt that a large part of the enemy's force is on its way either across the Peninsula to York River or going toward Williamsburg. I think there is no doubt that the movement is toward West Point or the White House. There is a rumor in New Kent that Douglas' cavalry had been at the Court-House and had been captured, as they had not been heard from for some days. Two gunboats were reported as being up near the White House. I regret that Lieutenant Waring did not prosecute his inquiries further and ascertain with certainty the point toward which the enemy was moving.

Very respectfully,

WILL. T. MARTIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

General WADE HAMPTON,

Headquarters Hampton's Brigade.
