General WARREN:

Under existing circumstances the general commanding cannot authorize the sending of Crawford's division to the old camp. Details may be made to send for all they may need.

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I feel quite assured that unless we have a work on the south bank of Hatcher's Run at Armstrong's Mill, as I stated this morning, the line now occupied by General Smyth on the left of General Humphreys' corps will be untenable. The enemy will have commanding ground that will overlook and take the line in rear in front of Armstrong's house. Major Harwood is of the same opinion. If the line is taken up on this side it cannot be well located nearer than from one-half to three-quarters of a mile off the stream. It seems to me the best line would be about from Fort Cummings, Westmoreland house, Tucker house, and C. W. Cummings. No matter where we put the line on the left bank, if the enemy establishes one on the other side along the high ridge from Armstron's Mill to the Vaughan road a small force will be able to prevent us from crossing the stream.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
