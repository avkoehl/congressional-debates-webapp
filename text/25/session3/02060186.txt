ply to Ml   Robfrtmw, and in defense of a reso
lution submitted by him in the select committee
Mr   H , in duseussing this subject, went behind
thegiound assumed by tin foimei gtntleman,and
argued that it was entutly inconsistent with the
Constitution for the Ft deial Government to hold
lands within the limits of the ¡Mates, and it was
nevir the intuition of th< framus of that instru
ment that it should     If ihiswcu so, mdhcuttd

orders of the day

mg hour till one o'clotk, (making it two houis,)

every day all the business of the country The
yeas and nays were ordered on his icquest
Mr ADAMS moved to lay the motion on the
table, and demanded the yeas and nays, where-
upon,                                                                             1

BRONSON, bills on their final passage    He then J
withdrew the call for the yeas and nays
Mi CHAMBERS said he hoped the House
would make no suspension of the rules, but allow
the business to piogress in Us prescuaed order
Mr ELMORE inquiied what the bills were,
which weie of sueh pressing necessity, that pri-
vate chums must be set aside
The SPEAKER was not at hbeity to íespond,
as the motion precluded all debato

the House would indulge him m going on with

The SPEAKER laid before the House i com   |
muni'ntion fiom theComptrolh rof theTieasury,
in compli met with an at t of Congress, transmit
ting a statement of the balances standing upon
the books, of the «venue which had remained
i unsettled by colleetois of customs and others,
which has been due more than three years prior
to the 30th of September
| Mr HOFFMAN then rose, and said he undei-
stood the Speakei had done him the honor to
place him on the select committee of mvestiga-
I tion íaised on motion of Mi Naylor, on Com-
modore tlhott's proeeedings in the Mediterra
nean lit asked to be excused fiom seivmg on
this committee, for the following reasons It
was known that one of his colleigues [Mr Cur-
tis] was seivmg on anothoi (the defalcation)
committee, and Tus other colleague [Mr Cam-
brixfng] was fully occupied m attending to the
public bustmss as chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Mtans For Mi H to seive, would
involve his entire absence fiom the sessions of i
the  House, because a labonous examination of
j peisons and papers would have to bo gone into,
and hence the afTansof his constituents would
be necessarily ntgleeted, as they fell, for the rea-
sons he had given above, almost entirely upon
his shoulders His duty to them, to himself,
and to the House, compelled him to prefei this
request
Mi JI was excused by the House, and the
Chan directed to fill the vacancy
CIVIL LIST BILL
On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG, the
House then lesohed itself into the Committee
of the Wnole on the state of the Union, (Mi
BavivS in the chair,) and lesumed the constdeia I
tion oí the " bill making appiopriations foi the
civil and diplomatic expenses of Government foi
1839 "
The question pending was on the motion of I
Mi. Bronsou to reduce the appropriation for the
Navy Board one half, and to abolish the board
after the 1st of July next
Mr POPE was entitled to the floor, and he
addressed the House at great length With refer-
ence to the amendment, he said he had been at
first inclined to vote for it, but, upon reflection,
he did not think they were prepared to effect so
sudden and great a change ¡n one of the great
branches of the service He was willing to pause
till next session. Mr P , however, said he hoped
he should be excused for speaking on matters and
things in general His election came on in Au-
gust next, and he wished to say something not
only for the benefit of the House, but also of his
constituents He commenced by an appeal to
Mr Adams to reperuse a document that came
from Mr A 's own pen, one of the ablest pro-
ductions thateverfell from an enlightened states-
man, his work on our right to the fisheries, when-
ever he felt disposed again to discuss the right of
petition
Mr ADAMS rose to a question of order He
wished to know if the gentleman's argument was
relevant He had no objection to it, on the con-
trary, he hoped the gentleman would be allowed
to proceed, but, then, Mi A hoped he would
be indulged m an opportunity of replying, and
not be gagged with the question of irrelevancy
The CH4IRMAN ruled Mr Pope to be out
of order on this ground
Mr GIDDINGS moved that he have leave to
proceed
Mr POPE assured the House he had no in-
tention of discussing the question of abolition.
Mr ADAMS, disclaimed any objection on his
part to the gentleman's proceeding with his argu-
ment, but as he had made a dnect appeal to Mr.
A , and had alluded to a matter upon which he
should feel himself called upon to make a re-
sponse, he wished the question of relevancy set-
tled at once, so that, in his reply, Mi A might
not be put down
The House granted the leave asked without a
division
Mr POPE again assured the House that he
should never disiuss the question of abolition,
and for the leason that he had no fears about it,
foi he ne\ er knew a man from New England em-
igrating to aslaveholdmg Stateevertoseta negto
free [Laughtei f Mr P was going on to nar-
rate an anecdote connected with this subject,
when he was called to order by the Chair
Mi SLADE desired to know if the new prin-
ciple was about to be established in Committee of
the Whole, that everything not direct to the sub-
ject under consideration was out of order>
The CHAIRMAN had made no such decision
Everything on the subject of the Navy, on ap-
propnations and expenditures, &c , would be in
order, but every one must see that nothing en the
light of petition for the emancipation of slaves
| could be in ordci in discussing the bill to provide
for the naval service
Mr SLADE rose again, and made some allu-
sion to Mi Bi-ll's remarks the other day on a
similar point raised on Mi  Giddings
Mr BCLL instantly called Mr S to order,
and said the Chair was entnely correct in arrest-
ing Mr Pope's lemarks Mr B , however,
moved that he have leave to proceed in older,
This motion was again agreed to
Mi POPE assured the committee he had no
intention of transgressing the rules of order, and
he renamed from fuithei allusion to this topic,
Mr P then lefeired to Mr Murray's speech,
which he said he had road with great pit asure,
designating it by far as the ab! st defense ever
made of the Administration, and expressed his
admnation of the absence m it of all denunciation
and calling of names He advised his Whig
fuends to puisue an honest couise, and nevei to
make charges without proof Mr P then went
into ageneial review of the leading pnnciples of
the last and present Administrations, to all of
which he dissented, and gave his reasons at gieat
length Mi P advocated liberal expendituies, on
j the ground that heavy disbmsemcnts were bene
I fioial to the poorei classes, &c He approved of
the land scheme of Mi Ci ay, and contended that
if the plan had gone into opeiation it would have
pievented the redundancy in the Tieasuiy which
that gentleman foresaw He was understood also
I to advocate the American system of Mr Clay,
