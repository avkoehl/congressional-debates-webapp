Price in his movements against General Steele's line of communication and the country north of that, or of crossing the Mississippi. Should the latter be the case, you will be pleased to use all the means in your power to prevent the accomplishment of this purpose, and also afford every possible assistance to the navy in any operations it may undertake with this object in view. The force at Morganza is now held in readiness to move up the river, in case of necessity, and the force recently sent there by you will be returned as soon as the intentions of the enemy have developed themselves sufficient to show that it can be spared with safety.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, August 2, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Commanding District of West Tennessee, Memphis, Tenn.:

SIR: The major-general commanding has been reliably informed that the rebel force recently in front of Morganza, La., has been withdrawn and is now moving eastward, apparently for one of two purposes, either of crossing the Mississippi, or of going north to join Price. General Gordon has been instructed to govern his movement sin accordance with the information the gains about the intention of this rebel force, and if he finds that they will interfere with General Steele's line of communication, he will remain at White River until the emergency has passed. I am instructed to request that you will keep a watchful eye on the operations in the Department of Arkansas, and hold a sufficient reserve force in constant readiness to render General Steele sufficient assistance should he need it. The commanding general expresses the opinion that you will now be able to spare a handsome force for service outside of your district. Your latest returns show a larger effective force than either the Department of Arkansas or the Gulf.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Numbers 212. Saint Louis, august 2, 1864.
