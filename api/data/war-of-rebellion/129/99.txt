The adjutant-general of the State has estimated that the State has put into service 100,000 men, but his calculations contain an apparent error, in which he has accounted for 14,000 men twice. His estimate should therefore be really less than mine.

While North Carolina, with a larger white population than Georgia, has put less into the service than that State, yet there has been actually a greater number in the former State which have been brought from their homes to the call of the country. This disproportion between the number put into the field and the exempted is partly owing to the occupation of a portion of the State by the enemy and the fact that the exemption list is much swollen by the requisitions made by the Governor of the State.
