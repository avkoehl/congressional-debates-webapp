HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., April 7, 1865.

(Received 6. 45 p. m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War:

The Congressional committee appointed to examine into Indiana matters have applied to me for an officer experienced in service in Indian country to go with them to Indian country, New Mexico, and Utah to direct their attention in the investigation to the points which need reform, and the manner in finding out what is sought by the inquiry. It is exceedingly desirable, in view of the unsatisfactory condition of Indians and the hostility of Indians to War Department officials, that such an officer be sent with the committee to see that the fact are fully brought out. Otherwise, as there are certain to be many Indian agents and superintendents along, the military will be placed in very unfavorable and false positions. I wish to send General McCook, who has served long in the Indian country and knows all about these matters. His services at Helena are not important, as Reynolds has taken away a large part of his force. Can I send him?

Have just returned from Arkansas. Canby stripped the department of horses. Reynolds' cavalry nearly all dismounted; has not horses enough for necessary reconnaissances to enable him to intercept raid or invasion of Kansas or Missouri by Price. Please order 5,000 horses to be supplied him without delay. Letter and requisition sent by mail to-day.
