I beg the inquire if it is known at army headquarters where the pontoon train of General Sigel is; and, if so, to be informed thereof.

Major-General POPE,

Warrenton Junction:

General Ricketts having reported his division within 2 miles of Sulphur Springs, just in rear of King's, and having been on the march since early this morning from crossing over from the Waterloo road, I have, to save time and to distribute the fatigue of marching, ordered General Reynolds' division to the Waterloo road and Ricketts to fall back in reserve. I have instructed King to avoid useless cannonading at Sulphur Springs. It will take till late this afternoon to get the troops into position on Waterloo road, I have written to General Sigel for a statement of the position and strength of his force, particularly his cavalry, and have sent to find General Milroy, but have not yet heard from either. Cannonading still continues at Sulphur Springs. I told King to withdraw his division out of his range.

General King reports he has received a flag of truce from General Anderson to return a woman dressed in man's clothes captured by them this morning. I report the circumstances, as it is the first information I have of the presence of this division in our immediate front. I understand Anderson to have Huger's former division. This division, so far as I have learned, was the last of those now before us to leave Richmond, and was at Louisa Court-House when Longstreet was at Raccoon Ford. If I am right in these suppositions, it seems to strengthen the impression that I have that the enemy's extreme right rests at Sulphur Springs. I draw another inference from this flag of truce - that there is at least a division at Sulphur Springs. It is true these are mere inferences, and I only give them as such, for other divisions than those we have heretofore heard of may have left Richmond since our last information.

General Sigel's bridge train has arrived. I think it may be useful. General Milroy burned the bridge at Waterloo before he retired from
