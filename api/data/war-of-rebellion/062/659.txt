General FISK,

Commanding District:

The following dispatch has just been received:

CENTREVILLE, MO., March 18, 1864.

COLONEL: I have just learned that a rebel force of 400 or 500 men passed near Colonel Dickens' farm, on Logan's Creek, 18 miles south of this place. The scout I sent out at the sending of the former dispatch has not yet returned.

JNO. N. HERDER,

Commanding Post.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., March 19, 1864.

Colonel J. B. ROGERS,

Cape Girardeau, Mo.:

Assistant Adjutant-Genera, Saint Louis, Mo.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram advising me that General Curtis gave information of an intended uprising in Jackson County. The troops are on the move to meet the rascals if they try it. The border is alive with persons of this character, and I have placed the troops in positions that will give them the command of the country at all times, and as they are constantly moving, will be able to learn if the enemy are moving in any direction.

I do not believe that there is any foundation for this report; and the part of it that recruiting is being done for the South in Platte County, and that they will concentrate in Jackson and move south in a body, is so different from their usual mode of operations that
