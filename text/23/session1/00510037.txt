REMOVAL OP THE DEPOSITES.
The resolution of Mr POLK, to reconsider t'ie
vote by which tne repoit of the Secretary of tKe
Treasury upon the removal of the deposites was
referred to the Committee of the Whole, coming
up—
Mr BURGES, who was in possession of the
floor from the previous day, after apologizing to
the honorable member fiom Georgia [Mr. Clay-
tov] for having interrupted him, said that, from
vai ious reasons, he was induced to dec'me address-
ing the House, and would now yield the floor to
him
Mr CLAYTON sa.d he had only risen from a
desire to protest against the mannei in which it
had been sought to involve him in a charge of in-
consistency in a speech which was unfinished
From that charge he could, howevei, jast.fy him-
self, and he would still maintain that he wab pei-
fectly consistent in his foimer opposition to the
bank—an opposition which he still avowed—and
his now voting, as he meant to do, against tpis
motion to reconsider. He maintained that as his
opposition to the Bank of the United States was
grounded solely upon principle—fiom its uncon-
stitutionality, in having a connexion with the Gov-
ernment— he could not see any difference could arise
when it appeared that the Government was con-
necting itself with the State banks It was uoon
this ground, if no other, he was justified. But,
apart from this, he was opposed to any action on
this subject by a committee out of doors, know-
ing the encouiagement that such a direction to it
would, no doubt, give to speculators in stocks,
who would, in some shape or other, get insight
into their proceedings, by reports to the House
or otherwise. He desired to have the reasons of
the Secre'ary of the Treasury examined in the
House, to ensure a speedier action than could be
had elsewhere. He argued, that if the reasons of
the Secretary were not sufficient for the removal
of the deposites, then he ought not to have removed
them. But he begged to be understood distinctly,
that he did not war against the directors of the
bank; he warred against the'institution on pnn-
r ciple alone He would not lend his aid to have it
crushed suddenly. No' He knew too well the
rum and suffering that must ensue from the sud-
den winding up of an institution in which the
pubhc had so deep a stake—sufferings in which
the Government itself must participate. He rather
wished the institution to be let easily down, and
that no attempt would be made to press on meas-
ures which must terminate m the destruction of
thousands
Mr. SPEIGHT declared, that as he thought
the debate was carried on long enough upon what
was only a preliminary question, he would move
the previous question.
Messrs. BRIGG3 and WARD having been
appointed tellers, the House refused to sustain the
motion—ayes 102, noes 113
Mr. DENNY thanked the House for having
rejected the motion, and said it would go well to
the country as a good augury for this question,
and show, also, that there were in the House those
who would not suffer any attempt to force upon
them the operation of what was aptly termed the
gag law, made only with a view to prevent the
expression of their sentiments. He contended
that if the ieport was sent to a select committee it
would have the effect of preventing any discussion,
or letting the public have any lights upon it He
asked, to use the language of the gentleman fiom
Tennessee, why the friends of the Admimstra'ion
retreat from the discussion' He was not one of
those who wished to do so, and that gentleman
and those who acted with him ought to stand, to
use the trite motto semper paratis They ought to
have been prepared foi the result when they pre-
sented to the Congress the reasons of the Secretary,
and have a prompt and immediate discussion upon
it, affecting, as it confessedly did, the public ciedit
and all the other important interests of the country.
If it was sent to the Committee of Ways and
M ans, it might lie there, as v/as said by the mem-
ber from New York, full ninety days,and it would
then have to come here and meet a similar delay
Adverting to what was aigued bv the honoiable
member fiom New York, [Mr BtArnsi ry,] that
it was unnecessaiy to have the r poit acted upou
here, as pubhc opinion had sett'ej that the pubhe
deposites would not Le restored, he, (Mi D ,)
however, differed from him as to this being a
proper view of the publ c opinion, but if it was so,
he asked, was that a reason why theie should not
be any discussion here' Tha  hono.able member
also obseued tl at the pr.vate oi standing commit-
tees vveie best, as they could nvestigate the facts;
but he maintained it was perfect'y competent for
the IIo ise itself to have an/ examination they
thought piopei to hiwi as fully as a ^y committee.
He thougnt that much injustice would be dore to
the people if full discussion upon the reasons of
the Secietary was not now had, and contended, at
length, that as the Secretary was bound by law
to furnish his reasons, they (the House of Repie-
sentatives) were bound to examine, to pronounce
upon them, and thus resfoie the nation to that
s^ate in which it was before the remrfval took
place, to do which, they should not defer investiga-
tion untd after the ev ^ had leen mciea ed ten fold
Mr Vi^DERrOEL said that he could not
boast the honoi claimed by one o<" h s colleagues,
[Mi Silpen,] of representing the lri^est com-
mercial city in the Union, but he nught claim the
honor of representing a people as deep! y i.itei ested
in the action of this Government as a>e the woithy
constituents of tl e gentleman ftoni New York—a
