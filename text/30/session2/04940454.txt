THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 5,
not intend to deprive the Mexican Republic of the free and
unrestrained faeuity of ceding, convening, or transferrin? at
any time (as it may judj>e be-t) the sum of twelve millions
of dollars, which the same Government of the United States
Is to deliver in the places designated by the amended article."
He understood, that by a provision In the twelfth
article of the original treaty, the United States
•were to issue certificates of indebtedness to Mex-
ico for twelve millions of dollars, which would
become in their hands liks so much negotiable
Unjted States stock. But the Government of the
United States, deeming itself only bound to pay
the instalments from year to year, stipulated m the
treaty, refused to issue transferable certificates of
stock, and, as he thought, for very good reasons.
One was, that Mexico might have readily sold
such stock in every market, and thus supplied her-
self with the means of keeping up the war An-
other reason for this course was, that upon the
faith of the payment cf these instalments of three
millions a year by the United States, under the
solemn guarantee of the treaty, it was just as good
as stock at par; it was just worth so much, and
no more. But if the stock had been made nego-
tiable, it would have commanded a premium—an ,
advantage which the Senate, with good reason, '
refused. Still, what did the President of the Uni- ;
ted States say in this protocol? He had said, in \
effect, to the Mexican Government, "Notwith-,
standing the Senate have refused to pay you in the i
manner you have preferred, by refusing to issue !
certificates oP stock, yet the Senate uo not mean ,
by that, in the slightest degree, to affect your full f
right to sell and dispose of your claim against the
United States in any way you please." Who did
not see a substantial difference made in the terms
of the treaty by the suppression of the twelfth
article? Gentlemen upon the other side of the
House could not be blind to it. Yet this the Pres-
ident of the United States had solemnly denied in
the protocol from which he had read, and by such
means obtained the tatincation of the treaty, which
otherwise, there was good reason.to believe, he
could not have obtained.
He considered, if these things were true, that 1
they furnished very good reasons, at least, for ma- ,
king the inquiries proposed, and that the present
was the time to make them. j
He proceeded to offer some reasons in reply to |
the^objection of the gentleman from Alabama \\
against making the demand for information abso- j
lute, and to point out sundry precedents for such
a course. ;
The President (he said) might'refuse the inform- ::
ation called for, notwithstanding the demand was
made absolute. The President had shown his !,
power to refuse on former occasions. But, after
the House should have thus called twice for the
same information, and faded to obtain it, it would ;
then remain for the House to measure strength ;
with the Executive; and then would come up the
question about which the appi ehensions of the gen-
tleman from Alabama seemed to have been awa-
kened. He (Mr. S.) was not sure but that time
had already come; nor, Ijut that it had transpired
lonof before this time. But here was now a most ■'
glaring instance in which the Executive of the
United States had undertaken to procure a treaty I
by fraud, and to present to the country a ratified
treaty which did nottell the whole tale. This was :
one glaring instance; but there had been oihets ;
equallyso. We had had the case of the Executive h
waging war, while Congress was in session, without q
referring the question to them. We had had the
case of the President of the United ptates swearing
in a whole country at once, and making them cm- .
zens without the constitutional forms; erecting an •[
independent civil government within the acknowl- ,
edged limits of the sovereign State of Texas; and ;
then taking some of these citizens and hanging them j
for treason. We had had the case of his estab- ■.
Iishing revenue laws over the ports of Mexico, and
collecting and disbursing money which never came <
into the treasury of the United States. We had 1
witnessed all these unauthorized acts of the Exec- !
tive; and it the country had forborne so long, it did 1
not follow that the time would not come at all ,
when forbearance would cease to be a virtue. The !
time had now come, as he considered, when the !
question should be settled, whether the President j
might regularly assume to be the whole Govern- I;
meat, or whether he should remain willing merely j,
to consider himself only an integral part of it, and j!
it was because the present inquiry involved these !i
considerations that he was in favor of it. i]
' Mr. BURT said, I think I am in the category of
a very lar^e number of the mem berg of this House,
who stand quite at disadvantage in this debate.
My friends on the othersideof the House have ac-
cess to sources of information that,I very strongly
suspect*, and some gentlemen near me have cer-
tainly obtained information from a source which
we all"may very well conjecture, I have had
!> none. And in order that we may get the inform-
\ ation which they have on the one side and on
the other, I move the previous question.
An.d there was a second.
: And the main question (being first on the amend-
: ment of Mr. Houston) was ordered to be now
| taken.
ivlr. STEPHENS asked the yeas and^nays on
(he amendment, which were ordered.
| iSir. WISNTWORTH inquired if the question
; on the 1'^solution coulu be dhided ?
1 he yPSAKEu. answered m the nc-ge.tive.
Tne question, "Shull the amendment be adopt-
ed'"' was then taken and decided in the negative—

So the amendment was rejected.
The question recurred on the adoption of the
original resolution.
Mr. W ENTWORTFI rose to -i privileged ques-
tion, and moved to reconsider the vote by which
the amendment had been rejected.
T.ie S^SAKER. Did the gentleman vote with
the ma [01 ity :
^ IMr. \VENTWORTH replied that he did, and
he would be saved the necessity of making the mo-
tion to reconsider, if the gentleman from Georgia
[Mr. Ste phe-n-s] would modify his resolution.so
as to embrace !he inquiry of the gentleman from
Alabama, leaving out the conditions. He (Mr.
W.) had voted with the gentleman against the
amendment 01'the gentleman flora Alabama, be-
cause he wished to exclude that part which made
it optional with the President whether to answer
it.
Mr. STEPHENS. I told the honorable gentle-
man from Alabama that I would modify my reso-
lution so as to crnbrace his inquiry, though I think
it is unnecessary, as it is included in the resolu-
tion.
After some further conversation—
llr. WENTWORTH sent up to the Clerk, by
whom it was read, the following amendment:
And that thG President be teijucsteii ubo to communicate
tn ffiw :i copv ot the instructions; of tins Government
to Comnii-sioncrs A. H. Sevier and N. Cliffoid-; together
wjtii - !K'li otiiPi cn!re=:p.i]id'*nceas nppeiUiiiH to said treaty.
Mr. STEPHENS accepted the amendment, and
modified ins resolution accordingly.
Mr. WENTWORTH moved, then, to lay on
3 table thft mnhr n tn- rhp x;ni-o mn tho
| The SPEAKER overruled the point of order.

So the resolution as modified was agreed to.
Mr. STEPHENS moved to reconsider the vote
and to lay that motion on the table; which .latter
I motion wns agreed to.
; STATUT. OF WASHINGTON
! Mr. i\IEADE asked the general consent to offer
| the following resolution:
Hcbo'veS, T:.at the C:imnii:tee on Public iiYpendmires
mquirt into t!ip expediency ((? causing a copy of the Wash-
u ^ton '•titfue in tin C.iprtoi of Virsinia, to ba taken m Amer-
ican maiui^.bvan A'nerican artist, and be placed in the
the Capitol, and the said committee icpou by bill
the table the motion to-reconsider the vote on the
amendment. Agreed to.
The question then recurring on the adoption of
the resolution ns modified—
Mr. ASHMUN called the yeas and nays; which
were ordered.
Mr. MURPHY raised the point of order that it
was not competent for the gentleman from Georgia
to modify his proposition. 0
lotnm!
! or -,\ -e,
1 Xo objection bein  made, the resolution was
j received, and the question bein<* on its adoption—
I Mr. MI5ADE said, if the House would indulge
j hin, he would give a brief history of this statue.
I In 1765 the Legislature of Virginia ordered this
j statue to be made. Houdon, a distinguished Pa-
1 risian ?rtist# was employed for the purpose. In
! the fall of that year he spent several weeks at
1 Mount Vernon, and took a cast of Washington m
plaster, which served as the model. He is thus
, taken from life, in the uniform of a general officer,
j The likeness was pronounced by Chief Justice
| Marshall, I learn, as the beat that was ever taken
j of Washington. If this statue should by anyacci-
1 dent be destroyed, we should lose the most faith-
1 ful representation of that greatest of men that now
| exists. (Exhibiting a block of marble) Mr. M.
said, here in a specimen of marble taken from a
| quarry m the county cf Rockbridge, Virginia,
| admirably suited for statuary, and gentlemen m-
j form him that in Georgia and Alabama are ex-
; tensive quarries of beautiful marble. He wished to
i see a copy of this statue—a copy purely Ameri-
! can—standing in the rotundo of this Capitol, for
I the sublime moral Ufcet it would not fail to pro-
; duce throughout the Union.
| The resolution was then agreed to unanimously,
; PCUXJC LAJCfDS. .
i Mr. EMBREE moved that the rules be sus-
J pended to enable him to offer the following pre-
j amble and resolution:
* "Whereas it id df-siraMe that as manv cultivators of the
soil a* possible should be the owners of the land they oc-
cupy, improve, and cuifivate: tbeieforc,
Resohed, That the Committee on Public Lands inquire
into the expediency of granting one half-quarter section of
land to all pen-on;* owning no real estate, who will settle
and continue to occupy and improve the same for five yeai£s
or ?uch other period of time a^?aid committee may deem
expedient; and that they report by in!) or otherwise.
Pending the question, Shall the rules be sus-
pended for the purpose aforesaid?
On motion of Mr. KAUFMAN, the House ad-
journed at thirty minutes past three o'clock.
PETITIONS, ETC.
The following petitions, &c., were presented under the
rule* and lefem-d:
hy Mr. Slt/VESTRR: The petition of inhabitants of
Chatham, Columbia county, New Yoik, for the mluction of
po-ia^e, and for the abolition of the franking pnvilege.
By Mr. NEWELL: The petition of A. M'. CaipBtiter and
129 "other*, petitioning for a reduction ot*postage rates, and
the entire abolition of tlie franking privilege.
