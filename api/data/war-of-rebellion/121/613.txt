We will examine first the consolidated report of the sick and wounded Federal prisoners: During six months from the 1st of March to the 31st of August, 42,686 cases of diseases and wounds were reported. No classified record of the sick in the stockade was kept after the establishment of the hospital without the prison. This fact, in conjunction with those already presented relating to the insufficiency of medical officers, and the extreme illness and even death of many prisoners in the tents in the stockade, without any medical attention or record beyond the bare number of the dead, demonstrate that these figures, large as they appear to be, are far below the truth. As the number of prisoners varied greatly at different periods, the relations between those reported sick and well, as far as these statistics extend, can best be determined by a comparison of the statistics for each month.

The following table presents the mean strength, the total diseases and deaths, and the total cases and deaths of the most fatal diseases:
