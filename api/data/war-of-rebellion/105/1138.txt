Indians. I intended to make a trip among the Shoshones, but the upsetting of one of my wagons in Susan River, which resulted in losing some commissary stores and 1,000 rifle cartridges, prevented me from doing so. Added to this, I was almost entirely destitute of funds. These causes rendered it imperative for me to return to this point as speedily as possible. There is a bad feeling among some of the settlers in the vicinity of Susanville. Several of these told me that if I made a treaty with the Indians they (the settlers) would kill the first Indian they saw. On the other hand, a large and respectable portion assured me that any action had by the military authority would be sacredly observed by them. I gather the following facts from my observations: The stealing does not appear to be done by any one particular tribe, but by a band of renegades who are gathered from the Pah Utes, Pitts, Bannocks, Modocs, and Shoshones. The country north of Susanville is not settled by the whites, and presents a succession of beautiful valleys as far as the lakes in Oregon. This band of renegades makes forays into the valley, steal stock, and run it off over the mountans into these valleys. If there is any chance of the stock being retaken the Indians slaughter it without hesitation. Eleven white men have been killed by these Indians during the past four years. Settlers will naturally become exasperated when they are subjected to such annoyances. A military post established in the vicinity of Honey Lake Valley would have a tendency to greatly check these outrages. I inclose to you for the information of the department commander a camp* of the country through which I have passed, together with such portions of the country east of my route as I am personally acquainted with. Having only a pocket compass, pointers, and stars to guide me, this map must necessarily be very imperfect; still it is sufficiently accurate to affor of the territory through which I traveled. should the department commander determine to locate a command in the vicinity of Sussanville I respectfully offer the following suggestions for his consideration: Cavalry would bebetter than infantry. Stores of all kinds can be transported from San francisco via Red Bluff to Susanville cheaper and quicker than by any other route. Willow Creek Valley, fifteen miles north of Susanville, would be an excellent location for a post. There is an abundance of grass, wood, and water. A reserve could be located from which could be cut out nearly all the hay required for a company of cavalry. The abundance of timber would remove all heavy expense as regards the building of quarters. A natural wagon road could be run to the post from Sussanville. Oats or barley can be purchased in the fall for 2 cents per pound. In addition to these facts the post would be located in the immediate vicinity of several tribes of Indians, rendering it comperatively easy to hold them in constant check, while the valley would soon be settled by enterprising men. After obtaining all the information possible I am candidly of the opinion that the citizens of Honey Lake Valley and vicinity are in need of military protection. I have endeavored to the extent of my ability to carry out the wishes of the general commanding as embodied in his orders to me dated April 24, 1862, and I have been thus particular and lengthy in details because I deemed that the expedition warranted it. Inclosed please find mpa of route from Carson City to Susanville and back. I will await at this point further orders from the general commanding.

I have the honor to remain, with much respect your obedient servant,

GEO. F. PRICE,

Captain, Commanding Company M, Second California Vol. Cavalry.
