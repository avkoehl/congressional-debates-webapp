Respectfully,ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General TERRY:

Nearly all the troops have now been sent in that can be spared. The major-general commanding directs me to say that he depends on you to see to it that they are not piled up but well developed, especially to the right and connecting with the mill-pond on the left. Use abatis and eery available obstruction in your front-rails, logs, and barricades. Get the troops ready to make an assault.

By order of Major-General Birney:
