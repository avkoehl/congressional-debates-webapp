directed. The rebels will most probably take the routs via Mount Pleasant and Lawrenceburg to Florence-this distance is fifty-three miles; to go by Pulaski it is something over sixty miles; and all roads to the eastward are proportionally longer. It seems to me that our march should be by Williamsport, toward Eastport, crowding the enemy on that flank as much as possible. If it is intended to carry the pursuit beyond the Tennessee River, and gun-boats can control it as far as Eastport, we could lay a bridge and cross the whole army there. Please advise me what course I shall pursue.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
