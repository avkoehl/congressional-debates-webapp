576_____________             APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,                   Dec, 1837.
25th Cong"**2nd Sess.   ___________________President's Message~-Mr. Cmhing.                                                          H. of Reps.
la reference to this power, as exercised under the late Ad
ministration, I make no question of corsiuutional right I
concede, m deference to the Constitution, long settled, and per
haps the true one, that the powei of removal is correlative to
the power of nomination, and vested in the President alone
Be it so It Ia, undei any view of that question, a most enor
inous power and under the latter construction, and as pram
«ally used by tiie lite Administration, it i& a power utterly sub
versive m its tendencies of the constitutional rights of Congress
Thi  tapir i& a trite one It is the ordinary theme of decla
mation, in the mouth of men opposed to the Administration
But I am not declaiming On the contrary, likf the adventurer
in the Arabian tales, tiansported by genu into the crystal
caverns of the interior earth in quest of Nature's mexhausti
ble store house of the diamond and the emeiald, 1 am calmly
seeking, guided only by the spirit of liberty, to explore the
inundations of eternal tiuth And I do solemnly believe, that
the patrenage of the Executive, as it has been and is exeiused,
by men who claim that the official functions of the "government
aie spoils due te the partv victoi—patronage applied directly
to the ínteres1 of individuals possessing or seeking office and
indirectly through them m all the íamihcaüons oí social rela
tionship—patronage applied to the gieat fountain of popular
opinions, the Preas—pationage applied to members of Con
gress and othei elective agenta of the People that the ap
pointing powei, so exeiused and applied, is one ol the wtdk
points of the Constitution
Nor am I smgilar in i oming to this conclusion as the lesult
of the experimental woikmg ot the Federal Government \ou,
Mr Chan man, can bear witness to the opinions expiessed by
Mi Benton in his leport on Executive pationage (Umttd
States Senate May 4,1S& ) I adopt his position that the exer
cise of this powei ha  a constant tendency to sully the purity
of oui institutions, and to endangerthe hbeiti^s of the coun
tryj" that, to pie vent abuses in this direction, "much lemams
foi us to do, ao 1 much will still remain foi posterity to do—for
unborn genuauons, on whom will devolve the sacied task ol
guarding the temple oi the Constitution and of keeping alive
the vestal llame of liberty," and thum ' th theatre of real
life'around us, ' we behold the weiknig of patronage, and dis
cover the reason why so many stand leady in any country and
in all ages, to flock to the standaid of power, whensoever and
by whomsoever it may be raised ' To all this I say di to And
1 add further that, true as it was then it is a hundied fold irue
e nee the reconrse had by the late Administration to the unspar
ing use of what Mr Benton in the same State paper justly call
ed 'the kingly prerogative of dismissing ofñeeis without the
formality of trial," and handing ovei their places to new as[ i
rants as the íewardof moie zealous partizanship To cenfirm
which, I cite the comparatively recent repoit on the same sub
je t made by that statesman who, if I' know ' his ' position "
stands now in the attitude of the very pillir of the present Ad
ministrationm the South I mean Mr Calhoun, (United ¡states
Senate, Februaiy 9 1835,) and I adopt aleo, his language, that
the patronage ol the Fxecutive is becoming a danger most
"foimidable, which threatens if not ai rested, to subvert the
Constitution," that the dibeabe is da ly becoming more aggra
vated and dangerous, and if it be permitted to progress Tor a
few years longer, with the lapidity with which it has of late ad
vanced it will soon pass beyond the reach ofiemedy," that itis
no party question, and that'eveiy lover of his country and of its
institutions, be his party what it may, must see and deploie the
rapid growtb of patronage, with all its attending evils and the
certain catastiophe which awaits its furthti progies-* if not
timely arrested " And I appeal to every man who hears me I
demand of this House whether there be one member who can
stand up here, and, m. his conscience and upon honor, deny
the progressive increase, the alarming inciease, of th" mfiu
enceof the Executive, thiough the exercise oi this mighty
power?
"He shall, from time to time, give to Congress information of
the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration
such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient '
(Art XI, sec 3) This power is a very general and seemingly
a vague one, but, on examination it will oe found a most ím
poitantone, and very capable of abuse
What is the true meaning of this clause? May the Piesi
dent dictate measures to Congreso No this, it will be ad
imtted on ail hands cannot be the true import of the Constitu
lion It was the intention ol the framers of the Constitution,
undoubted y, to give to each of the great departments of the
Government a theoretical independence of the others This
tndependence is very emphatically asserted in the Constitution
of some of the ¡states That it i& implied in the Constitution of
the United States is fully argued and established in the nu nheis
of the Federalist The doctnne asundeistoodand assertedm
England of the Constitution (so called) of that country, is stated
in the nervous languageof Lord Bohngbroke thus
1 The constitutional independency of each paitof the Legis
lature (the King included) arises irom hence, that distinct
rights, powers, and privileges, are assigned to it by the Oonsti
tution * * It consists properly and tiuly in the fee un
biassed, uninfluenced, and independeut exercise of these lights,
powers, and pi ívileges, by each part, in as ample in extent as
the Constitution allows, or, in other words as far as that poi nt,
where the Constitution stops this free exercise and submits the
proceedings ol one part, not to the private influence, but to the
public control, of the other parts Befoie this point, the mde
pendency of each part i° meant bv the Constitution to be abso
lute, from this point, the constitutional dependency of each
part on the others commences '
And to the same effect is the language of Mi Ben on who,
in another repoit oí the same period w th that which I have
cited already, lays it down as " the ruling pimciple in the oi
ganuation of the Federal Government" that the three gieat
branches of it, "the Executive, I egislativ ,and Judiciary should
be separate and distinct from each other not only in contem
plation of law, but in point of fact and for this en 1 that each
should not only have its independent organization but that the
individuals administering each should be wholly fiee from the
«ontiol and influence of the individuals who administer the
ethers " In accordance with which, as I understand tne Oonsti
tution, though the President may recommend measures yet
Congress is to exercise an unbiassed and independent judgment
upon the question of adopting or rejecting such recommenda
tion     It is a recommendation simply
But again Assuming these premisas to be sound, what is
the exact force of the expression "recommmeod. measures,"
according to the true spun of the Constitution"? The gentle
man from Georgia {Mr IIolsey,] in his remaiks this mormngt
% way of reply to my colleague [Mi   Reed,] who objected to
a usage, said to exist in the practice of the Committee of Ways
and Means of this House, toieceive bills ready drawn frem the
I xt cutive Departments—delerds the practice under this el-tuse
of the Constitution, and he distinctly speaks of it as a powei
(topiopose laws to Congress,5' «Hid he contiaots our institu
tions m this particular with those of England, m which, he
says, 'the proposing powei is denied to the King, whilst in
ours it is vested m the President "
Can hi* be? Does the President of the United States posse&s
the miative m legislation, as well as tha velo? It may be so
but I do not remember to have íemarked this heietofore, m any
of the discussions touching the Constitution I cannot assent
to it    If it be so, it is the exact tase of the French chaitei
And, in ie?ard to the case of England, the intelligent gentle
man fiom Gt-orgia knowt  full well, that the King of Great Bn
tain possesses, practically, the power of initiating laws, by rea
son of the fact that among the Sen etaries of ¡state there are
always members of the Hou^e of Lords and that commoners,
holding effice under the Crown, are eligible to the House oí
Commons and die in truth the leaders in that body, and the
proposeisol all important measuies Conformable to which is
the fact that, in Fiance, the King's Ministers have the rig it to
sit and debate m either Chamber The framers oftheConsti
tjtionofUe United States indicated their sense oí tlu« by ex
pit-ssly excluding fiom Congress ill persons holding offices
undei therede.al Government (Ait 1, sec 6) Whethei
this exclusion has indeed, opeiated to the advantage ot the
public liberties may be doubted Certain it is that if the pnn
cipal officers of the Dspartments were by their duty required
to attend and debate m this House or in the Senate, the mea
sures they lecommend, and the views they entertain or ex
pu&s could be subjected to a seventy and strictness ofscruti
ny which is quite unattainable as the Constitution stands
But continues the gentleman from Georgia "The powei to
recommend is general It includes all the particulais " And
by mlerence, draughts of bills If such be the force of the
Constitution then I say that bills, like other communications
from the Executive ought te come to the House directly, and
m a public form If there beany usage to the contrary of this,
I con end that it is a bad ons—adepartui e from the spirit of
the Constitution Such a usage would open the door to clan
de->ti le ai rangements between the Executive and the Commit
tees of Congress
Mi Jones of Virginia here lose and said Does the gentle
man fiom Massachusetts mean to insinuate that there had boen
any clandestine arrangement between the late Committee of
Ways md Means of which I was a member, and the Execu
tive or the heads of anv ol the Depaitments1*
Mr Cushino I will a swer the gentleman e question by
-estatmg my pioposition that if bills may come lieie, not in
the shape of a public communication from the President, or Se
cretary of the Treasury, or any other Department-4)ut, instead
of that, through a commute*  oily, oi the chairman of a com
rmtlee, then Isay that, if such be ihe reading of this clause of
the Constitution, it involves in itself a tendency to clandestine
arrangement between the Executive and the committees ol this
House
Mr Tones    The gent "man has not an^weied my question
Does the gentleman from Massachusetts mean to i ismuate that
there was any such clandebtine arrangement between the Com
mittee of Ways an 1 Means of the last be^eion and the head of
either of the Departments?
Mi Cusiiinc Well, then, I can only repeat what I havp b°
lore said 1 insist that recommendations from the .Executive
to this House which come not in the shape of dnect and public
communications involve an unavoidable tendency to clandes
tine arrangements Whether, in the paruculai case reJened
to there wag or was not any such arrangement, is a fact ai to
which I have no knowledge, and make no charge
Mr Wisk lose and said, he was prepared to assert that, m
relation to the fortification bill, on the last night of the second
session of the T wen y third Congress, there was a cándenme
arrangement between the Executive and a membei of a com
mittee of this House
Mr Jones Of that I know nothing Has my colleague any
chargeto make against th" committee of which! was a mem
ber? If so I desiro to hear it
Mr Wise As to the committee of which my colleigue was
a member, that is a matter concerning which, having no pei
sonal knowledge, I make no asseition 1 repeat that there was
a clandestine anangement m the transaction to which I allude
Mr Cambrelkng    I can only t-ay that I deny it flatly
Mi Cushing Well, if the gentleman fiom New York [Mr
Cambrelei\u] wishes for a renewal of the debate of the last
Congress on this vexed subject I have no doubt the gentleman
fiom Vugmu[Mi Wi-^e] will be ready at all times to meet
him upon it I am arguing a constitutional point, the confide
ration of which I will not mix up with any controverted ques
tions of fact
He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed \
power, this also, broad, compcehensive, implying a geneial
•supervision of the afFans ofthe United States, and of mestima
ble capacity for good or evil
Is it not so? Look at it, m puiely domestic questions, a« in
the ca^eof a eontroveisy between the Federal Go\einmentand
one of the "-Hates of which the proclamation of the late Presi
dent ofthe Unite i States on the Nullification Question isaco
gent example
Another example of still widei efficiency, Washington b cele
íat^d proclamation ofneutiality Whethei this measure was a
judicious one or not, whethei constitutional oi not, aie ques
tions much debated atibe time, bu*- not necessary to be discuss
cdm this connection I concede the lawfulness of the act, that
is considering it, what it really pnrpoits to be, simply a<= a
State paper, declaratoiy ofthe htcl that the United States was
at peace with all the belligerent powers, ind enjoining upon
the citizens ofthe United States to abstain from the perform
anee of any acts inconsistent with peace I concede thi«, and I
refer to it only to illustrate the cons quential greatness of the
power Reflect on the situation of the United States it that
time Bound to Fiance by the treaties of amity aud oi com
merre of 1778, which, on our part, guard itied the integrity of
the French possessions in America, and give to herthemo-^t im
portantbelhgereant rights with regard to commeice, and also
in the ports ana seas of the United tetate5' Called upon never
theless, by considerations of good faith towards ofhfi nation's,
and the duty of maintaining the peace of the countrv, toab
stain frem all acts inconsistent with strict neutrality And-yet
this momentous qu*sUun-~-oiie md* of which might perhaps,
if taken, be deemed by Fiance an abrogation of our treaties
with her, and the other side, if taken, be deemed by England
adequate cause of war, with a long train  f conseqüenewen
either side—was decided by the separate and mdepeadeittwffl
of the Executive
Each of these distinct heads of the power of the Executive,
asexpies^iy defined in The Constitution, is, it seems to m%
gieatly susceptible of abuse These powers are distinguished,
a« already intimated, hy the generality, the comprehensiveness
of the terms of grant They are, for the most partj indepen
dent and complete m themselves, m so marry words,, and
where they a e riot expressly so, they are practically so Thus
the rejection of nominations is, m comparison with the ivhofe
number of appointments, a rare thing, and so is Uie íefusal to
ratify UeatKs They are continuous poweis, powers charac
tensed by peipetuity (ioragiven time) of actual exercise. Se
crecy, individuality of conception, oneness of counsel, belongs
to them, as it does to the functions of royahty In all these,
and many other particulars of the same nature, the Executive
evidently possesses gi eat facilities for the abuse of power.
But I may be reminded of that which constitutes, m thesry,
theguiianty and saleguard of Congress, namely, the right ofthe
two Houses, or either of them, to refuse supplies to the Execu
ti\e, and so to encroach on Ins functions, and it ia proper I
should anticipate this consideiation
The Houses may withhold supplies from the Piesident
Granted, and so may he, by the exeicise oí the veto, withhold
supplies from the two Houses
Bv* the Houses may, by a concurrent vote of two thirdsou the
bark of a veto, obtain supplies in spite ofthe President. Grant
ed that is a possible contingency m some future competiUon of
powei betwt-en the Executive and legislative departments of
the Federal Government It is the one disadvantage to
which the Executive is subject, and let us look at the
many advantages wherewithal he may balance this one dis
advantage
To begin, he is the single Executive chief of the nation, and
while, as a general truth, m a monarchy or an aristocracy, the
danger of innovation is from the popular assemblies, if there be
any in a democracy, ihe danger is from the popular chieftain,
foi the time being, into whose hands all the power of State tends
to concentrate itself, as the teady means of giving despotic e£ñ
ciency to the supreme will of the Democracy Thus, m Rome
monarchical the popular assemblies innovated, until they had
obtained a due share ofliberty, in Ronje republican, the chiefs
innovated, until that liberty was all gone Thus, again, in mo
dem Europe, aftei the estabhshmpnt ofthe \anous feudal mo
narchies, we have seen the popular assemblies encroach to ob
tain or recover liberty, and that liberty, when obtained, fell into
the clutches of civil or military dictators In aRepublic, watch
well the popular Chief Magistrate
But agam, supposing a caieer of usurpation is to be under
taken, let us look at the relative advantages of the President
and of Congress, as drducible from the structure of the Consti-
tution
Ihe President, we have seen, has a voice in all acts of Con
gress, except impeachments, either miginally, as m the reconi
menddtion of measures, the nomination to Executive offices, the
proposition if tieatieb, oi, finally, by the v*to The Senate
chetAs the Executive dnixtly, only by its rejection of treaties
and nommatuns, and indirectly, in common with the House, by
the vote of either upon money bills
Congress can influence the President only by debate, opi
nions, or by refusing supplies, but the President has the same
extent oí powei m each of these respects, and, in addition
thereto, the vast patronage of the Government
Congress influences the people, only by acting upon opinion
The President has the same means of influence, and the fre
qu^nt exerci&e of it by the late Administration, in theunexam
piel number of Canciones ad Poptdum which it sent forth in
various foi ms, indicates how efficiently it may be used. Add
to which, he may act on the peop e by the power of appoint
ment, by the activity of public officers in elections, by the in
strumentality of the pres", and, if need be, by the physical force
of the Government, which he w lelds
Congiess has no direct control over the President, except by
impeachment, a remedy which, whatever force it might once
have been supposad to have, is now pretty generally admitted
to be nugatory, because it is most powerless just precisely
where it is most needed, that of a President, who, besides the
enormous patronage attached to the office, and the physical
power legally at his command^ is fenced around with the immu
nities and the means of indirect action, which, m everyRepub
lie belong to a chipf of party
isor is this all The House may think I have gone through
the Constitution very imperfectly, and slurred ovei many ofthe
functions of the Executive, or at least of which the Executive
is m the habitual exercise What has become of the meney
power of the Executive"? "What of the Land Office? What of
the Post Officei What of the Indian Department? Are these
not somewhat extensue fields of influence, of powei, and of
usurpa' ion*
To begin with the Ii dians For two years past nearly the
whole army of the United Spates, and large bodies of mihtia
and volunteers, and va«t amounts of treasure, have been em
ployed m a wai with the Seminóles Did Congress declare it?
Chiefs of the remote tribes of the West are seen collected in the
Federal City summoned hither by the Piesident, to submit
themselves to his mediation in their quarrels, and to cede taefr
lands to the United States Does the Constitution give him this
power? He is the ereat. father of the aboriginal inhabitants of
North America Who made hira vo be all this? What piovi-
sioo of the Constitution makes him the head and ruler of all
their tribes and nations'* I would like to have the advocates of
a strict construction of the Constitution look a little into this
matter
The Constitution authorizes Congress to Tegulate commerce
''with the Indian tribes," but I do not remember that it gives to
the President any jurisdiction over them Practically, by a
striking fiction oflaw, but which is not all afiction, the affairs
ofthe Indians are conducted m the War Department, as if there
waspeipetualwar betwixt them and us Doubtless many of
the acta performed by the Executive in relation to the Indians
are to be classed under his constitutional power to make trea
ties But not ill nor the half Can a treaty, of iteelf, authorize
the President to be the great father of the Indians? Or can their
assent No more than a treaty can make him to be, at the same
time, President ofthe United States and King of Great Britain
No, the jurisdiction winch the President exsrcises over the In-
dians, except insofar as itmaf be justified by the treaty-naafe
mg power, can stand only upon acta of Congress, and where it
is not so derived, it is usurpation
And see how it works.   What great power it confeis en tfee
