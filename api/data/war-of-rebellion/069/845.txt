PETERSBURG, VA., May 28, 1864.

Major General W. H. C. Whiting having referred to me that portion of Brigadier General H. A. Wise's report of his operations on the 16th instant wherein it is stated that General Whiting was drunk, I hereby state, on my honor as an officer, that I was with General Whiting from the time of his arrival in Petersburg and during the day in question, and that he did not drink any spirituous liquor whatever; that I was present at his interview with General Wise on the night of the 16th instant and know that he was perfectly sober.

Seven hundred feet will cross the river. By using piles 600 might do.

HEADQUARTERS DIVISION, May 29, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel G. M. SORREL, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I send you a rude sketch of the position. If it be true, as the courier I sent you reports, that the enemy advance in our direction, I know of nothing to notify us of their approach. There is no obstacle to the passage of infantry in all the country between Breckinridge and Field. The first thing they would strike would be the artillery in the field in Field's front. I wrote an inquiry about the proposition to send a division in the interval between Early and Breckinridge. Please inform me.

J. B. KERSHAW,Brigadier-General.
