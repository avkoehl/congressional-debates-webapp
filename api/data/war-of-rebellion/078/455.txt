information. Colonel Prosser, with 250 cavalry-all I have here- returning immediately to Athens, will be joined five miles out by One hundred and second Ohio, about 350 strong; also 500 infantry will follow as soon as they can be gotten off. This is my whole disposable force, without leaving this post and Huntsville with too weak garrisons.

Major SOUTHARD HOFFMAN, Atlanta, Ga.:

Colonel Spalding sent courier yesterday from Squire Wilson's, on military road, who reached Pulaski at 2 p. m. to-day, with report that forrest, with 8,000 men and eight pieces of artillery, passed toward Athens from direction of Florence on the 22d, and camped at Rogersville that night. Colonel Sipes, at Columbia, telegraphs that Forrest was crossing the river at the mouth of Indian Creek on Tuesday. Colonel Hottenstein, at Johnsonville, telegraphs that 400 of Forrest's force crossed the river at mouth of Duck Creek last Tuesday. General Granger telegraphs that, from all the information he can obtain, the force in and around Athens belongs to Forrest's command. Colonel Prosser, of one of the Tennessee regiments, took 8 prisoners belonging to the Second (rebel) Tennessee Cavalry. They represent that they are commanded by Forrest; that they crossed the river at Florence, and that Forrest told them at okolona that they would have force enough to destroy both roads and stay in Tennessee as long as they pleased. One of the block-houses was commanded to surrender by General Forrest. Colonel Prosser says he is satisfied Forrest is with the men. All the available troops I have are commanded by Generals Granger and Starkweather; they have instructions to vigorously attack any force they find. General Steedman has ordered 2,500 men to be sent to General Granger.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 24, 1864.

Major SOUTHWARD HOFFMAN, Atlanta:

A dispatch from General Granger at Decatur, 5 p. m. to-day, says that Colonel Campbell surrendered Athens to-day, and that a detachment of 300 men, sent from Decatur last night to re-enforce Athens, was captured within a mile and a half of the latter place. General Granger estimates the force operating in the vicinity of Athens at 4,000. General Starkweather telegraphs from Pulaski that the enemy captured Athens at noon to-day, and that a large force was seen in the vicinity of Athens this morning. Colonel Spalding, who has returned from a scout toward the Tennessee River, says there is no doubt in his mind that Forrest is on this side of the Tennessee River with 8,000 men and eight pieces of artillery. Colonel Spalding captured 2 wagons and 3 prisoners. He says the report of prisoners and citizens correspond. General Johnson, at my request, has ordered General Croxton to march from Franklin to Pulaski and follow Forrest. Colonel Jones, with over 1,000 men, will march from here, taking a battery with him, at daylight in the morning.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
