HDQRS. DEFENSES OF NORFOLK AND PORTSMOUTH,Portsmouth, Va., July 14, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major J. S. GATES,

Bower's Hill:

MAJOR:There is a rumor here that Fitzhugh Lee is beyond Suffolk with a force of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. The general desires you to send out a reconnoitering party and ascertain, if possible, whether there is any truth in the report. The expedition to Chowan and Perquimans Counties will be suspended for the present.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. L. McHENRY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS, July 14, 1864-5 p.m.

General PALMER:

About 3 this p.m. I received notice from my outpost picket commandant that the enemy were making demonstration on our line of pickets, having killed the outer cavalry vedette on his post. I immediately dispatched, under Captain Green, infantry up the railroad; ordered the whole reserve under Captain Lee, Ninety-ninth New York, to skirmish up the Neuse road toward Core Creek; at the same time sent a cavalry force, under direction of Captain Charles G. Smith, acting aide-de-camp, out, all which caused the enemy to retreat post haste, and my cavalry are in hot pursuit, followed by an infantry force as support. I think the enemy should be called on to disavow this act of firing on pickets in the above stated manner, as this is a game I can play at with interest in my favor. Will communicate again if anything further turns up.

P. J. CLAASSEN,Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

(Same to General Harland.)

POINT LOOKOUT, July 14, 1864-9 a.m. (Received 10.20 a.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

All quiet. Five gun-boats on duty last night.

JAMES BARNES,

Brigadier-General.
