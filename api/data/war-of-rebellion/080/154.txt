General GEORGE G. MEADE:

The brigade next to General Burnside's attempted an advance of a skirmish line just now, and lost the officer in command of the line and several men in getting over the parapet. The enemy's mortars are at work, but they cannot fire much artillery other than this. The other brigades have not yet been heard from. Your dispatch is just received. I will continue to watch the enemy in my front.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

July 30, 1864-7 a.m.

Major-General	HANCOCK:

The report from prisoners would indicate weakness in the enemy's line, and that a considerable portion of it has been vacated. If Burnside and Ord gain the crest, the enemy cannot hold in your front, for they will be open to attack from front and rear. It was to take advantage of this contingency that I wanted you to have your troops in hand. The orders to Mott are all right. If the enemy are in force and prepared you will have to await developments, but if you have reason to believe their condition is such that an effort to dislodge them would be successful I would like to have it made. Burnside now occupies their line, but has not pushed up to the crest, though he reports he is about doing so.

GEO. G. MEADE.
