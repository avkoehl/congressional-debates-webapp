HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WESTERN KENTUCKY,Louisville, February 23, 1863.

Reliable information, just received, says Morgan crossed the Cumberland Thursday night between Hartsville and Carthage; supposed to be going to Hopkinsville. Look out for him, and fight him at all hazards.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

(Send this to Colonel Hobson, Munfordville; Colonel C. Maxwell, Russellville; Brigadier-General Manson, Bowling Green, and Colonel S. D. Bruce, Clarksville.)

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 23, 1863.

Brigadier-General CROOK, Nashville:

Your dispatch received. The report as to Morgan's forces must certainly be incorrect. General Stanley, with a force of cavalry, returned from beyond Liberty night before last, and left nothing there. There is also an expedition of 1,000 picked men in that neighborhood.

Major-General.

STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Major-General, Commanding Memphis, Tenn.:

Have heard nothing. Gunboats have gone up Tennessee River.

Fleet Captain and Commandant of Station.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Perceiving the Senate wishes you to select from your list of nominees, and having no friends to reward, enemies to punish, or axes to grind, I beg permission, in the interest of the service and the name of the Army of the Cumberland, to ask that the following brigadier-generals: D. S. Stanley, James S. Negley, P. H. Sheridan, Jeff. C. Davis, John M. Palmer, Thomas J. Wood, and H. P. Van Cleve, be promoted to major-generals; and that Cols. John Beatty, Thirtieth Ohio; Samuel Beatty, Nineteenth Ohio; W. P. Carlin, Thirty-eighth Illinois; William B. Hazen, Forty-first Ohio; George D. Wagner, Fifteenth Indiana; W. H. Gibson, Forty-ninth Ohio; and W. Grose, Thirty-sixth Indiana, be appointed brigadiers. They have earned promotion by hard fighting and hard service as brigade commanders. They will all be obliged to serve as such. Justice to them demands the rank and the staff, and justice to their regiments (always among the best) demands that their absence from the regiments should be supplied by promoting their lieutenant-colonels to colonels and giving them majors. Colonel Starkweather ought also to be made a brigadier.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
