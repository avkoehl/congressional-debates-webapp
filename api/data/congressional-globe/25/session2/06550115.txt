jeot about which mea are more liable to fall into
error, that in assigning causes for real or apparent
changes m public opinion. Most of us are very
liable to be biased in our judgments by our own
opinions and feelings on pending questions
A petition and remonstrance against the adop-
tion of this measure, has just been introduced by
the Senator from Massachusetts, (Mr. Webster.,)
signed, as i s said, by about five hundred of the
citizens of the town in which I reside I have not
examined it, and of couise know not who they are,
hut presume they are intelligent and respectable
cibzens, comprising, probably, many of the mer-
chants, and business men of the city This ques-
tion, it is well known, is connected with the politics
of the day, and the signers of this petition, I pre-
sume, are all of one political party. They have
their peculiar opinions on the subjects of banking
and currency, biased, I believe, in some degree, by
political cons derations, and in part by their parti-
cular pursu'ts A large portion of the metchants
m all out cities have .heir peculiar notions in rela-
tion to monetary affairs, which, in my opinion, are
riot only erroneous, but altogether adverse to their
own permanent mteiests They are entitled to
their own sentiments, and I will respect them so far
as they appear to have any just foundation in
pniciple, or to be induced by a regard to the
general ímerests of the country, and not by their
own psealiar interests, or those of a comparatively
small class
There is, I am well aware, a very violent oppo-
sition to this measuid on the part of certain classes
those connected with or largely interested in the
bank-, and meirhants in our cities, who expect to
be benefited by the use of the public revenue', and
other-, who may hive a strong, yet certainly an
er^oneou ,opinion that the measure might, in some
wa} , diminish trie capacity of the banks tor afford
mg them accommodations Still, however, we
aie to look mainly for the opposition to this mea-
sure to a different source It comes from a political
party, or rather from lhat coalition of the concen-
trated monej ed power of the country with a great
polttical party, wmeh commenced in 1832 and was
consummated in 1834 This union was more to
be dreaded than that of the purse and the sword, as
it united and brought into action, ior a common
object, two ot the siiongest passions known to the
human heatt—the lm e of money and the lovt ofpowei
Since that nenod the country has had no repose
Its currency, bad enough before, has since been
subjected to the most sudden and violent alternations
of re lundancy and scarcity, occasioned by the irre-
gular action of the banks, led m every instance
by the late Bank of the United States. Commer-
cial and other business has been subjected to the
same fluctuations, and employments that weie
once regarded as regulai and stable have become
little better than speculative gambling transactions
The public mind has been almost continually
agitated and alarmed by a succession of panics,
brought on by withholding from the trading portion
of the community their accustomed accommoda-
tions at banks, and in some instances, in our com-
meicial towns, has appioached to a state boidenng
on ft( n/y. Tins bitndmg of private mteie-ts with
lhe politics of the aaj , has imparted to party spirit
a tmge of bitterness and malignity wholly unexam- '
pled ,mcetie last war The grasping, monopo-
lizing spurt o nade, drawn in and united with the
aspnations of political power, have shaken the
vei y foundation of our social fabric Bioken mei-
chant- and broken down politicians, cYispsrated
bv ti cir mi f wtu íes, occasioned, as some hones'ly
be K\e, a> >1 otneis afftct to I-lieve, by the mea-
sures of the Government, (which, in truth, had no
more inf once 11 on them than the measures oí the
British Gü\^ ni e t,) have had the audacity to
threaten tne eountiy with cuil commotions, to
openly avow a determination to resist the laws, and
coolly to talk of shedd.ng the blood of their fellow-
Thegreat fountain from whence these b.tter wa-
ters have fowed, which have swept over our coun-
try, spreading dismay and desolation far and wide,
js the principal moneyed corporation, which con-
centrates, and m some measure, directs the whole
moneved power of this country, and no small share
of that of Europe With a capital of nearly forty
millions, reinforced by twenty-stx millions of the
dead notes of the late Bank of the United States,
and credit at home and abroad almost unlimited,
its power is nearly irresistible. It is now using
this power to prevent the resumption of specie pay-
ments by the banks, with the double object of pro-
longing the panic and public distress, and more
successfully prosecuting its commercial specula-
tions The people are insultingly told that the day
of reasoning has gone past, and that it is only from
their "sufferings'''' that it is expected to obtain their
consent to the restoration of the late National
Bank, or the establishment of another similar in-
stitution.
Sir, how long is this state of things to continue'
How long are these waters of bitterness to own
fiom this exhaustless fountpin^ From whence are
we to look for deliverance and repose to oui agi-
tated country from the harassments and panics of
this concentrated moneyed power, which, impelled
by the interest of selfishness and ambition, and free
from alt responsibility, is a greater scourge to the
country than an invading army12 How long can
the free spirit of our people hold ouf It is doubt-
less expected that it will finally yield, and that the
moneyed power will triumph over both the people
and the Government. It may be so, but when that
evil day comes, if come it must, our boasted liber-
ties will be but a name In this, as|m every othet
great crisis, I look wuh confidence to that vast mul-
titude of honest and incorruptible hearts, the pro-
ducing and laboring class. I m\oke their aid at
the present crisis, it is a lesource which at the dark-
est penod in our history has nevei yet failed, when
the country needed its aid, and I trust it will not
now.
I have alluded to the sources of the violent oppo-
sition to the measure befort Congress and thecoun
tn These sources are the banks and other spe-
cial interests, united with a powerful political par-
ty Of the extent of this opposition, I will siot pre-
tend to determine, nor can any one decide that
question, and whether the hostility to the measure
will increase or dimmish, time only can solve I
have confidence to believe that the country will
sustain this measure, but if it shall prove o iier-
wise, if a majority of the people shall be found
against it, I shall readily acquiesce in their decision
But as long as no such decision has been made, I
fed it my duty to act on the question according to
my own convictions of us merit , and regarding it,
as I do, as a measure in an eminent degiee calcu-
lated to promote both the interests of the Govern-
ment and the people, I shall give it my heaity ¡.up-
port
But the Senntoi from Massachusetts has inform-
ed us that this question has occasioned a revolt, the
laboring men, he sajs, have taken it in hand I
know not to what particular facts the Senatjr al-
luded, but as he made no application of the re-
mark, it may be reasonable to suppose that he re-
ferí ed toa handbill purporting to have been diawn
up and signed by twenty-two laboring men in
Nashua, New Hampshne. These laboring men
profess to be deeply versed in the subject of the
currency of the country, they probably obtained
their notions about currency from the honorable
Senator, as they discovered that the failure of the
banks, and the derangement of the currency, have
been occasioned by the "tampering" measures of
the Administration, and that the same cause has
stopped the factories and thrown all the laboring
men out of employment. This profound investiga-
tion, of the laboring men of Nashua, was printed
and circulated all over the State of New Hamp-
shire, to enlighten the people on the subject of the
cunenc} It was, however, deemed advisable to
investigate the matter, and ascertain how it was
that tnese twenty-two laboring men had obtained
such deep insight into the abstruse and m.}stifled
subject of currency The matter was inquired into,
and the result was, that the handbill had been
drawn up by a Whig lawyer, and that the laboring
men whose names were attached to it, and who
were represented to be friends of the Administra-
tion, were, with three exceptions, decided Opposi-
tion men, and the three declared that they signed
this currency circular in consequence of threats,
that if they refused they would be immediately
turned out of employment, and their families ex-
posed to starvation. Such is the only case of which
I have heard, of a revolt among the laboring men
on account of the currency. But this is not all.
After these facts were made public, and this small,
but base, attempt at imposition, exposed in New
Hampshire, this same handbill has been extensive-
ly circulated in my own State, and particularly in
manufacturing towns. Such are some of the honest
efforts to enlighten the people on the subject of the
currency.
Mr. President, whatever may have been the
conduct of the opponents of this measure else-
where, it must be admitted that the Senators op-
posed to it have exhibited great candor, impartiali-
ty, and fairness The Senator from Kentucky
(Mr Clay) seemed so desirous to signalize his
zeal for the measure, that he volunteered to stand
godfather to the child, and christened it before it
was born He called it the "execrable bill." The
Senator fiom Massachusetts declared the measure
to be a new thing under the sun, a new "experi-
ment" on the currency, he also considered it as in-
volving a total abandonment of the power and duty
of this Government over the currency; it was aban-
doning our duty, and hiding ourselves in caverns
and ho es, with the bats and owls He also regard-
ed it as providing for a haid money currency. The
Senator from Virginia (Mr. Rives) discovered in
this, bill almost every thing except what it actu-
ally does contain. With his keen penetration he
discovered a hard money enrrency in it, and a pa-
per money curiency, that instead of its being a
new experiment it was taking us back to the daik
ages, when kings had their strong box, but his most
remaikable discovery was, the germ of a bank,
concealed in the bill, which would soon be deve-
loped, with all its frightful proportions. I really
wish the Senator had been a little more successful
in proving that this bill contained the elements of
a bank, for, in that case, he would have secured
for it many friends among those most opposed to it.
Having, sir, disposed of these preliminary mat-
ters I will proceed the consideration of the bill, and
the substitute offered by the Senator from Virginia
I will begin with the substitute, which is the ex-
ploded deposite bank system, enlarged and ex-
tended, and embracing new and alarming princi-
ples. What are the objects of this scheme, and what
are the means by which they are to be accom-
plished'' There are three objects first, to manage
the finances of the United States; secondly, to form
a National Bank currency, and thirdly, to regulate
the issues of the State banks generally. How are
these objects to be effected? Why, by taking into
the service of the United States, and rechartering,
twenty-five of the most " respectable" of the State
banks. I do not undeistand the meaning of the
word "respectable," as applied to banks. I had
supposed all banks wei e respectable; but this scheme
is to make a distinction, and create an aristocracy,
among the banks, and as all banks are not only re-
spectable, but honorable, it would seem that the
wenty-five must be right honorable hanks.
This league of respectable banks is to be under
the supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury,
they arc to make returns to him, and he may exa-
mine into their affairs geneially, as well as with the
United States. The} are to peiform for the Trea-
sury all the services perfoimed by the late Bank of
the United States, for which they are to be entitled
to the use of all the pubLe revenues, without any
compensation, although the deposite act of 1836
allows two per-cent where the sum exceeds a cer-
tain amount Th? revenues in the Treasury will
average five or six millions, and at times will be
vastl} more, the use of which will be worth half a
million a year, but these banks will have the mo-
nopoly of supplying nearly the entire currency
received and paid out by the Gov ernment, which will
be worth half a million more. It is true, the bills
of such ether banks as may decline to issue notes of
a less denomination than ten dollars will be receiv-
able for public dues, but, with the exception of th 
league, few, if any, other banks will conform to
that condition, as it will not he for their interest to
do it. The twenty-five Treasury banks, therefore,
Will have {he entire monopoly of the public reve-
