WASHINGTON, May 4, 1864-5.45 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

I have an imploring appeal in behalf of the citizens, who say your Orders, Numbers 8,* will compel then to go north of Nashville. This is in no sense an order, nor is it even a request that you will do anything which in the least shall be a drawback upon your military operations, but anything you can do consistently with those operations for those suffering people, I shall be glad of.

A. LINCOLN.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., May 4, 1864-9 a. m.

(Received 2.40 p. m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Culpeper, Va.:

General Thomas has just started for Ringgold. All his command will be there to-night. General Schofield is at Cleveland moving down to Red Clay and closing on Thomas' left. General McPherson is here, and by night three divisions will be at Rossville, the other two will be there to-morrow, and all move to Thomas' right. Thomas will have 45,000; Schofield, 13,000; McPherson, 20,000.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Chattanooga, May 4, 1864-10 p. m.

(Received 8.20 a. m. 5th.)

General GRANT,

Culpeper, Va.:

Thomas' center in Ringgold, left at Catoosa, right at Lee's Tanyard. Dodge is here. Fifteenth Corps at Whiteside's. Schofield closing up on Thomas. All move to-morrow, but I hardly expect serious battle till the 7th. Everything very quiet with the enemy, Johnston evidently awaits my initiative. I will first secure the Tunnel Hill, then throw McPherson rapidly on his communications, attacking at same time in front cautiously and in force.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, May 4, 1864-4 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Some 20,000 of the militia raised in the Western States will be placed under your command. I propose to send some to Louisville, Nashville, and Memphis. To what other places all I send them? The volunteers should be ordered to the field as fast as replaced by militia.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
