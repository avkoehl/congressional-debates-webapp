#76 * THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE. March 4.
This sheet complete? the Congressional Globe for the 2d session of the 29th Congress, except the index to it, which we
expect to be able to send to subscribers within two weeks from this time.
The Appendix, which contains the speeches at length, written out or revised by the members themselves, we expect to
complete by the 10th of April. The session was such a busy one, that the members could not find time to write out their
speeches until it closed. Indeed most of the speeches haveJjeen so fully reported in the Congressional Globe, that many of
the members did not think it worth while to write out their speeches at all for the Appendix.
All subscribers who have filed their papers, and have failed to receive any of the numbers, can have them supplied by writing
to us for them immediately, and paying the postage on their letters.
We still have on hand surplus copies of the Congressional Globe and Appendix, for the session just ended, which we will
dispose of at the original subscription price, that is, $2 for both, or $1 for either, during the session.
We have also on hand, complete copies of the Congressional Globe and Appendix, from the commencement in 1833,
up to this time, bound in 16 volumes, with Russia backs and corners, which we_will sell for $59; or unbound for $43.
The Congressional Globe and Appendix will be printed by us for the next (a long) session, for $2 each. We expect
that each will contain fully 1300, and both together 2600 large quarto pages, as the two together made near 2500 pages the last
long session ; and it is our intention to report the proceedings more full in future than we have done hitherto, as both branches
of Congress have made liberal subscriptions for them. B. & jR.
