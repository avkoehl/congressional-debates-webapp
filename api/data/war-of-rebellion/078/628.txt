(Received 31st.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The troops in this department have six month's pay due them, and all disbursing officers are without funds. The want of money, both by officers and men, is great, and interferes with the proper performance of duty. Major A. B. Cooke has returned from Richmond, failing to get funds after very exertion. Is there no remedy?

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

[First indorsement.]

Respectfully submitted to Quartermaster-General.

JOHN W. RIELY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Second indorsement.]

MAY 31, 1864.

Respectfully referred to the Secretary of War.

This Department has made every exertion to produce funds, without success. Statements similar to this are reaching me almost every hour.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.
