(Received 8.20 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Is there a move on foot from West Virginia on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad? If so, it may account for Longstreet's retrograde movement and would also make it important to follow him with rapidity from Knoxville.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, February 26, 1864-4 p.m

Major-General GRANT,

Nashville, Tenn.:

The Thirty-fifth Wisconsin Regiment will be ready next week. It is also hoped that several Indiana regiments will be ready. To what points do you wish them sent?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

NASHVILLE, TENN., February 26, 1864-11 p.m.

(Received 10.20 a.m. 27th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I would like all troops for this division ordered to this place. General Sherman's movements may make it necessary to send other troops on to the Mississippi. If I learn anything, to show this I will telegraph you immediately.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN.,

February 26, 1864

Major-General GRANT, Nashville, Tenn.:

Captain Hall has been directed to stop the purchase of mules for this department. I have quite as many in Kentucky as I shall need.

The original order for a pack train was given for the advance which was proposed from here. It would be very useful if I had it now, but would take took long to get it here. I propose to do the best I can without it.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN.,

February 26, 1864

Major-General GRANT, Nashville, Tenn.:

I think it would be wise to send here 10,000 bushels of oats to be sold to the farmers for seed. It is the only method by which we can get forage here in the summer. The farmers have the money to pay for the oats. Please inform me if this can be done.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
