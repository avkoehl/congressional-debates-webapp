1858.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.:
izens of the other States. Competent as they were to all
• domestic matters, they only sought to establish a Govern-
ment which should provide for the interests of the Con-
federation in its aggregate capacity; and, jealous of their
separate independence, the States reserved to themselves,
respectively, all power not necessary to the General Gov-
ernment lor the end for which it was formed.
This limitation of power in the hands of the Federal Gov-
ernment, except so far as specifically granted, denies to it
all authority to act in relation to the domestic affaiis of the
several States, and has established the only solid foundation
for the perpetuation of the Federal Union. Under this prin-
ciple its limits may forever be extended, and its safety pre-
served. Various, and even conflicting, habits, customs, and
local interests, in the different States, will be protected by
their Legislatures, and are in no danger of being overriden
by the Fedeial Government; and, if each keeps within its
appropriate spheie, the prosperity of the States will be se-
cured, and the interests of the Union will be enlarged. Such
is the symmetry of our Government, its very existence de-
pends upon its severe adherence to tbe limitation of its du-
ties. Within that, it has no power but to bless; beyond it,
it has no power but to rum. This limitation is the anchor
of our safety; when it fails, it will involve the ruin of the
Republic. If the General Government possessed the power
to make grants for local purposes, without a consideration,
wifchin the States, its action, in that respect, would have no
limitation but such as policy or necessity might impose.
Every meritorious object would have a right to demand it;
and to such a refusal could only be justified by inability.
Every local object for which local provision is now made,
would press for supportupon theGeneral Government,and
would creaie demands beyond its power to meet, and, of
necessity, it would be driven into the policy which would in
crease its means. As its expendituies are increased the rev
enue must be enlarged, and the General Government, by the
adoption of the policy, would levy taxes upon the people of
the Union forthesupportof the local interests of the States.
If their expenditures should be unequally apportioned, the
injustice of taxing apart for the benefit of others would soon
cause the system to be overthrown. If they were equally
distributed, it would be but a usurpation of the functions
of the States, uncustomed even by the plea of economy.
The patronage would be fatal to the independence of the
States; with patronage conies the power to control, as con-
sequence follows upon cause.
If the policy is embarked in, what shall be Us limits ?
Shall the mciit of the object and the ability of the Govern-
ment be the boundaries of Us action ? To feed the hungry
and clothe the naked, if within its competency, would, in a
moral point of view, be quite as meritorious as any other
act which the Government could perform ; but, if the Con-
stitution had granted power for such a purpose, would it be
politic for Congress to make provision fortlie suffering poor
throughout the Union? If either lands or money could be
granted for the purpose designated in this hill, could they
not, and ought they not, to be granted to the budding of
churches, erecting school-house*, and the keeping up the
common schools in States and Territories ? If to one mer-
itorious object, why not to another? Or shall the action
of Congress in this regard be extended to every useful pub-
lic and private purpose within the States? If not, wheie
&haU the line be drawn ? If the principle be admitted, what
shall limn its application? Your committee have failed to
perceive how they could be justified in recommending a
grant from the General Government in support of agricultu-
ral schools, and in refusing one for any other object equally
meritorious. The means of the General Government are
taken from the people; if you take fiflfri it the public lands,
you give it money in the stead ; if you destioy its revenue
from that source,'you must increase it in some other. No
more expensive mode could be devised to support local in-
stitutions than to make the Federal Government the agent
to raise and distribute the means. With the States lies the
power npcc«s.iiy to their management and control. With
the States lies the power to secure an economical adminis-
tration of the funds, and to determine the amount which pru-
dence will allow to be expended in their support; and if
these institutions aie supported by means raided by the au-
thority of the States, no injustice can be inflicted upon the
people of the other States. State piovision, as between the
States, would be just from necessity, and fiom inteiest it
would be economical. The appropriation a<ked for ism
lands, but your committee can du-cover, in this regard, no
difference between an appropriation 111 lands or one in
money ; the effect is precisely the same in both cases. If
the revenue from the public lands is destroyed, the defi-
ciency must be met by taxes on the people.
The public domain belongs to all the people of the United
States ; their inteiest m it is common, and the Government
is but the trustee for the common benefit, limited in its ac-
tions over it to those poweis conferred by the Constitution.
It is a pait of the public fund-, and can be devoted to no
purpose forbidden to the money of the Federal Government.
If Congress impairs its value it must receive a compensa-
tion, or it will bCfaithless to its ti ust. The public good for-
bids the Government lrom extorting from the purcnaser's ne-
cessities an exoibitant price for the public lands; but while
the public welfare limits it to a reasonable action m this
rcspect, the public rights demand that some compensation
should be exacted, and such a reasonable revenue be secured
fioin the public domain as, without being oppressive upon
the purchasers, should be equitable towards those who do
not obtain the enjoyment of the soil. Such are the principles,
the recognition of which justice impei ativcly demands. As
n landholder, the Govei nment may legitimately bear a share
of the burdens imposed, to create an improvement which
will enhance the value of its domain, and may contribute
to that end; yet its aid must be limited within the extent
which does not require taxation to effect it. It may, as a
matter of power or right, contribute portions of the public
lands to improve the value of the remainder; hut even m
this, sound policy arid its duties towards the general welfare
will limit it to a'hcalthy and leasonable extent. Reason-
able donations towards impiovements which cause an in-
creased value m the adjacent lands are consonant with a
wise and just administration of the public domain. Such
donations increase, and not impair, the value of the trust;
but a gift which icduces the value of the public lands is m
violation of the beneficiaries' rights. The donations of sec-
tion sixteen for the support of the township schools was an
inducement to purchasers, and enhanced the valu# of the
adjacent lands, the sale of which indemnified the Govern-
ment for the donation which it made. So, too, the donation
of the salines. The facilities for obtaining salt were among
the first objects of the early settlers upon the public lands,
and the donation of the salt springs, and adjacent lands, to
cause their being worked, was a powerful inducement to
the pioneers of the West. The grants to the new States,
upon their admission into the Union, were upon conditions
which more than indemnified the Government.
The swamp-land grant was justified, becaus#it was to
remove a nuisance which injured the public and the Gov-
ernment as the proprietor of the adjacent lands; while the
grants for internal improvements brought a direct pecuniary
profit to the Treasury. Your committee are aware that a
few instances can be found where the action of Congress
has not been limited to the principles which we avow, but,
in our judgment, these instances warn us against them as
precedent of wrong. In extreme cases the laws are silent,
but the cases form no rule. In ordinary cases, when the
precedent is wrong, it should be condemned. It is always
an ungrateful task to refuse; but when duty demands it, our
committee feels that it dare not disobey. Our sympathies
impel us to extend a generous support towards some of the
objects for/which donations of the public lands are asked.
If our feelings could control, we should most cordially do
all that their friends could desire; but we live under a Gov-
ernment of laws, and the merit of the object cannot justify
the appropriation of means not our own. Want seldom in-
quires into the right of plenty to give—its own necessities
are its highest law. The ability of the General Government
naturally causes applications to it for assistance; and with-
out inquiring into its right to comply with their demands,
the needy press upon the Government for support. To sup-
port local institutions does not come within the scope for
which the General Government was formed ; and, if it pos-
sessed the powei,your committee can imagine no policy
more unwise. The public domain is a source of revenue.
In time of war it is one of the most effective means upon
which the country can rely; ltiwill secure enlistments when
money lails; and, in our opinion, we should indeed be care-
ful before we destroy this important aid. The public lands
are watched with a longing eye.
Your committee have now befoie them, exclusive of the
eases where there is a promise of compensation, applica-
tions for grants of land, money, and other objects, the most
of which, if not all, we feel bound to reject. Our land sys-
tem has been well and happily devised—under it, injustice
has been done to but few, but most have prospered. It has
furnished a moderate revenue without preventing the set-
tlcmentandimprovementof the domain. New States have
sprung up on it, whose prosperity is the admiration of the
world. Industry has the price of the public lands within its
reach; and the policy which made it has caused the wilder-
ness, not only to bud and blossom, but to bring forth fruit.
Thenew States have been encouraged ; the old States have
had their interests secured ; the spnit of our Government
has been obeyed, and its duties kept within the limits of the
law. Shall all this he disregarded, and the system over-
thrown? For what? If the prayers of the petitioners were
granted, the prodigious quantities of land which would be
thiown upon the market by competing vendors would de-
prive it ot marketable value. The very gratification of then
wishes would destroy the objects they have in view. To
make the giants would be to lenderthem of hut little avail.
Youi comnuttcc conclude that Congress, without a promise
of pecuniary compensation, has no powerto grant poitions
of the public domain; and if it had, no policy could be more
unwise than to grant it for the support of local institutions
within the States. They therefore ask leave to report ad-
versely to the indicated bill.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
W. H. W. COBB,
Chairman of CommiUcc on Public Lands.
It remains to me only to allude to the effect of
this bill. How much land do you suppose the
State of New York would get under this bill?
Twenty thousand acres to each Representative
would give to the State of New York, which has
an area of 29,440,000 acres of land, 700,000 acres.
I mean to say, that if the bill passes—but I have
no fears that it will pass, for there are several
other ordeals which it will have to pass through
before it becomes a law—it will give the State of
New York 700,000 acres of land. Iowa, with an
area of 32,54tf,960 acres of land, gets, under this
bill, 80,000acres, whileshe is susceptible ofhaving
her whole territory filled up, and of sustaining a
population as large as that of New York. Then
you see how unequally this bill operates. Towa J
gets80,000 acres, and New York gets700,000. Do
gentlemen expect that they will be able to get a
supplemental bill passed alter a while, so as to
place their States on an equal footing with other
States, such as NewYork ? I doubt it very much.
California has an area of 287,162,240 acres of land;
and under this bill she only gets 80,000 acres.
Will California sell her birthright for a mess of
pottage, as Alabama has often done in the votes of
her Representatives for railroad grants? Arkan-
sas, with an area of 33,406,220 aci'es, gets,xmder
this bill, 80,000 acres, while her population will
probably be trebled or quadrupled m twenty
years.
Prom the best sources of information now at
hand, the present population of Michigan is
800,000; Wisconsin, 750,000; Iowa, 60U,000, and
California, 600,000. Here these four States, with,*
an aggregate population 6f 2,750*000, would at
this time, by an equal distributionyponi^e, tares*
ent ratio of representation, be entitled to 340,00.0
acres; yet under this bill they get but half th$(j
amount. And yet these facts do not truly
sent the unfairness of the distribution by thisiittr
for while the new States, by the rapid increase of
their population, are entitled to more, the old.
Suites are entitled to less representation in Con*%
gress. Therefore, in this ninth year of the pres-
ent decade, congressional representation is no
fair basis upon which to make a distribution of
public lands for agricultural colleges, or any other
purpose.
And that brings me to another point. The gen-
tleman proposes by his amendment to exclude
the Territories from th$ benefit of this bill. Utah,
with an area of 140,925,440 acres, would have
got, under the original bill, 20,000 acres; but ac- 
cording to the amendment, will get nothing. So
with Minnesota, with an area of 90,776,960 acres,
and which might be entitled as a State, within a
few days after the passage of this bill, if it do.
pass, to 80,000 acres. So with Washington Ter-
ritory, with its area of 80,000,000 acres; and with
Oregon, with its 125,000,000. I will not say any-
thing about Kansas, lest I might disturb thehar-
mony of the House. I have got here a tabular
statement showing the area in square miles and
in acres of the several States and Territories, and
the land to which each would be entitled undefc
this bill as amended. It is as follows: ,

Mr. BURROUGHS. Will the gentleman al-
low me to interrupt him?
Mr. COBB. The gentleman will excuse me.
He knows that I am only a humble farmer; and
I do not wish to be thrown out of my line of ar-
gument. The Committee on Public Lands have
determined, this session, to husband the public
lands as much as possible; but, notwithstand-
ing that, this bill proposes to give away some six
million acres to the States, while the Territories
are altogether oveilooked. You find the Terri-
tories often neglected in this way; but, whenever
they come in as States, and have their Senators
in the other branch of the national Congress and,
their Representatives here, then their rights are
respected and their political favor courted. I am
ashamed to say that I have myself often neglected
the Territories because they have no votes. But
it was wrong; and I censure my.own action on
former occasions, and admit that it was wrong.
Now, one word more, and I will close. When
