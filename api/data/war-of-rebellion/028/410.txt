Camp near Knoxville, Md., October 10, 1862-10 a.m.

General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, U. S. Army, Washington:

There has been much delay in passing supplies over the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The obstacles seem to be near Harrisburg. Forage can be purchased in that vicinity quite cheap. I would recommend that Captain Eddy be sent there. He is acquainted with the country and its resources.

ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE,

ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

Washington, D. C., October 11, 1862-12 m.

Colonel R. INGALLS,

Quartermaster, General McClellan's Headquarters:

The 100 cars referred to by Mr. Smith were asked for by Colonel McCallum, on requisition of the Commissary Department, to transport 500,000 rations, ordered to Hagerstown from Alexandria. They have all been furnished, loaded, and gone. The customary supplies for Frederick and Harper's Ferry are also sent regularly. I am certain that the clothing and stationery sent to Harper's Ferry must be there; it has all left the depot here. There was some little unavoidable delay here for want of cars, but all has now gone, and, with each of the last lots sent, special messengers went. I am informed that there are a number of cars with quartermaster's stores not yet unloaded at Harper's Ferry.
