THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

safely into port the argosy freighted with
•wealth for others to enjoy; the toiling mil-
lions whose lives are spent in a fierce struggle
for existence, and whose very blood is coined
into gold to fill the coffers of the rich; all
these are compelled lo pay tribute to your pub-
lic fisc, while he who hoards his gold and day
by day and hour by hour adds cent., per cent,
to his thousands, goes free irorn all taxation.
Tax as much as you choose the luxuries of
the rich ; such taxes are not, felt. Those men
of wealth who possess culture and refinement
are not deterred by faxes from purchasing
articles of luxury which contribute to their
enjoyment. Those other men ot wealth, who
do not possess culture and refinement, I mean
those who have grown suddenly rich by gam-
bling in gold or stocks, or bv robbing the
Government under the thin disguise oi con-
tracts—the ring-masters and ring-men" in
all Government jobs—such men prefer the
article because of its high price. They esti-
mate books by the extent of sur'ace and amount,
of gilt edge ; they value paintings as they do
silks, accoidmg to their cost per square yard;
they boast of the cost of their fine houses,
fine pictures, fine furniture, and fine equip-
ages ; they are proud of the high price of their
fine wine? and fast hoises, and some of them
even of the high price of their fast women.
Tax the luxuries of those men as much as you
please, but. spare, I pray you, the few luxuries
of the poor.
Let us examine now into the practical work-
ing of your system of internal taxation. T
propose to show bow unjust and unequal it
is; how burdens are imposed upon cer;ain
sections, and other sections are almost entirely
relieved.
The entire value of property in the Uni-
ted States by the census of 1870 was $29,975,-
781,300—(see census report on " wealth, tax-
ation, and public expenditures,'' page 10. table
one)—say in round numbers, $30,000,000,000.
Now, a tax of fifty cents on §100 worth of prop-
erty would produce $150,000,000. Forthe fiscal
year ending June 30, 1871, there was collected
from all sources of internal revenue the sum of
$144,011,176 '24. Now, let us see what States
paid the bulk of these taxes. The entire wealth
(real value) of the State of Massachusetts was
in 1870, according to the census, (see page 10
as above.) S2,132.148,741. If a tax of fifty
cents on $100 worth of property were imposed,
Massachusetts would pay into the public Treas-
ury $10,660,743. On the other hand Virginia
has an aggregate wealth of the real value of
$409,588,133. A tax of fifty cents on $100
of property would produce $2,047,940. Under
a just, system of taxation Massachusetts should
pay $10,060,743, and Virginia $2,047,940.
Now, let us see what these two Slates actu-
ally pay under the present system. As already
stated, the entire internal revenue for the fis-
cal year ending June 30, 1871, was $144,011,-
176. We must deduct from thi*, adhesive
stamps, tax on salaries, and fees for passports.
Thesedeductionsare made, becauseitis impos-
sible to ascertain from what, States these items
are deiived, Deducting these three items there
remains the sum of $127,873,100.
Now, let us see what amount of this sum is
paid bj Massachusetts and what, by Virginia.
On page 207 of the report of the Commisiouer
ot Internal Revenue iiudcr date of November,
21, 1871, wo will find that Mass ichuse'ts p,"d
SO,801,074. while Virginia paid $5,319.2(2;
that is, Massachusetts paid a little over one half
ot what she should have paid, and Virginia
paid more than double what she should have
paid. In other words, Virginia, overrun, laid
waste, her entire labor system overthrown,
with all of her banking capital destroyed, and
her financial system utterly deianged, was com-
pelled to pay her own taxes and one half of
the taxes of Massachusetts. But this does not
tell the whole story ; for in addition to the
taxes actually paid in the State there were
shipped in bond about twenty million pounds
of ^manufactured tobacco, the tax on which
paid by Virginia manufacturers amounted to
$6,400,000.'
Mr. DAWES. Will the gentleman be kind
enough to answer me a question?
Mr. DUKE. Of course I will, with the
greatest pleasure, if I can.
Mr. DAWES. I have been very much inter-
ested m the gentleman's figures, and have
felt some considerable pride in the great
wealth of Massachusetts, as exhibited by his
statement, while at the same time I am sorry
that ihe comparison between my State and
Virginia is so much to the disadvantage of the
latter. Considering that Virginia is an older
State than Massachusetts, about five times as
large as Massachusetts, has a finer soil and
better climate, larger forests, good iron and
coal mines, and the grandest water-power in
the world, perhaps the gentleman can tell me
the reason his State is at such a disadvantage.
Mr. DUKE. 1 will tell ihe gentleman the
reason. Itisbecause from the foundation of
the Government down to the present time
Virginia, has been taxed and Her money has
been rolled into the coffers of Massachusetts.
That,' is lue reason, sir; it is your whole sys-
tem of taxation. While we were contending
for what we called constitutional rights, you
were collecting in the Federal money. That
accounts for the difference.
Mr. DAWES. And you got rather the
worst of the bargain. [Laughter.]
Mr. DUKE. We did, decidedly.
Virginia is an agricultural State, Massachu-
setts is a State of capital and manufactures.
Let us take another instance. The five New
England Stales of Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, have
in tlie aggregate taxable property of the actual
value of $1,814,989,309. Atax of fifty cents on
$100 would produce $9,074,946. Now, on
the other hand, the great agricultural State
of Illinois has an aggregate taxable properly
of the value of $2,121,680,579. A tax of fifiy
ceins upon $100 would produce the sum of
$10,608,402. Now, let us see what these five
New England States actually pay and what
Illinois pays. The five States named pay
in the aggregate the sum of $3,187,720, that
is about one third of what they should pay.
On the other hand Illinois pays the sum of
$15,119,609, that, is one third more thau she
should pay ; or to put the matter in another
light, the agricultural State of Illinois pays all
ot her own taxes and nearly two thirds of the
taxes of the manufacturing and money States
of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Con-
necticut, and llhode Island.
Mr. BUIiCHARD. Is that on internal
revenue ?
Mr. DUKE. Yes, sir, internal revenue
Mr. BUIICHARD. You charge to us the
taxation collected upon whisky. \ou lorget,
that we do not consume all the whisky we
manufacture. [Laughter.]
Mr. DUKE. I am aware of that. I know
the common doctrine is that the consumer
pays the tax on any commodity. I admit that
so far as concerns luxuries used by the rich,
the consumer does pay the tax ; but when you
come to the little comforts ns«d by the poor
man, the tax is partly paid by the consumer
and partly by the producer. I have heard
it gravely urged that the laboring men of this
country would have their whisky.and tobacco,
lie matter what price might be fixed upon_tt.
Sir. I repel this imputation upon the laboring
men of ihe country. They ;ne frugal, and
your taxes diminish their comforts.
The same results as in Massachusetts are
presented in the protected State ot .Pennsyl-
vania. I might carry this comparison further,
and show how unequal and unjust your taxes
are, but these examples will sulfice.
it may be said, however, that, the ability to
pay taxes dependsa good deal upon the quan-
tity of money in circulation; granted. Now
let us see how matters stand in this regard.
I quote from the report of the Comptroller
of the Currency, of date November 10, 1871,
page 15, appendix; in the State of Massa-
chusetts; the actual national bank circula-
tion amounted to 857,480,866. The national
bank circulation of Virginia amounted to the
pitiful sum of $3,312,400; that, is, for every
dollar in circulation in Virginia there were
nearly twenty dollars in circulation in Massa-
chusetts. It will be said, however, that this
is not a fair example. Let us take another
instance: the national bank circulation of
the five New England States of Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont., Connecticut, and Khode
Island, amounts to the sum of $49,396,275,
while in the State of Illinois the national bank
circulation was only $13,722,825. The State
of Connecticut, which has a population of
only 537,454. and an aggregate of wealth of
$774,631,524, has a circulation of $17,800,455 ;
while the State of Illinois, with a population
of 2,539,891 and an aggregate of wealth of
S2,121,680,579,hasacirculationof$13,722.825.
Why, sir, the little State of Rhode Island,
which might be taken up and deposited in
many places in Illinois without the inhabitants
being aware of it, except froin the smell of
cod-fish and onions—ibis little State, with a
population of 217.353 and an aggregate of
wealth amounting to $296,965,046;; that is, a
little more than one tenth of the population
and one tenth of the wealth of Illinois, has
about the same bank circulation with this latter
State, the forme'- being $13,236,805 and the
latter $13,722,825.
1 desire to call the attention of the House,
and especially of the llepresentalives of the
State of Illinois, to one or two other fact-;
shown by ihe census tables • in the year 1850
the population of Illinois was 8)1,47'); in I860
it was 1,711,951, and in 1870 it was 2.539.891.
Now, how was it in Massachusetts? Ju 185!)
the population of Massachusetts was 994.514;
in I860 it was 1.231,066; in 1870, 1.457,351.
To put it in another light, from 1850 to 1860
the populatiou of Illinois increased about,me
hundred per cent., and from 1860 to 1870 it
increased about fifty tier cent.; on the other
hand, the population of Massachusetts between
1850 and 1860 increased not quite thirty per
cent.., and between I860 and 1870 it increased
not quite twenty percent. Now let us look at
the increase ol wealth. In 1850 the wealth of
Illinois amounted to only $150,265,066; in
I860 it had increased to $871,860,282. and in
1870 it had increased to $2,121,080,579.
Between 1850 and 1860 the increase of
wealth in Illinois was more than four hundred
per cetn., and between 1860 and 1870 it was
about one hundred and forty-five per cent. ;
that is, the increase of wealth between 1860
and 1870 was much l 'ss in proportion to the
increase of populatiou than between 1850 and
1860. To put it in the form of a proportion r
1830—13001 p,J100 per cent, increase.
1S60-1S7UJ  -repuiau ^ 50 per cent, increase.
1850—1860 1 \i-„„ni, i 400 per cent, incrcn-.e.
lb(50—1S7U/   1145 per cent, increase.
Now, how stauds the case with Massachu-
setts? in 1850 the wealth of Massaciin,- s> ;s
was $573,342,280; in 1860 it had only in-
creased to $815,237,433, while in 1870 if had
increased to tlie euoiinous amount of $2,132.-
148.741. Between 1850 and i860 the increase
of wealth 111 Massachusei ts was about forty-
five per cent., while between 1860 and 1870
'he increase of wealth was upward of one
hundred and fifty per cent. :
1S50-1S601 Pmmlitwin 1 80per cent, increase.

1850—lbs30 ! ■> v,.,,1J 45 per cent, increase.
1S60—lSit)/   1150 per cent, increase.
To sum up m the decade between I860 and
1870 as compared with the decade be„wt-eti
1850 and I860 in the agi ieulturat State of I'll -
nois, the increase of wealth as compared
with the increase of ponulation has dimin-
ished in the proportion of two hundred to one
hundred and forty-five ; while iu the man-
