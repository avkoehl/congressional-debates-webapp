HEADQUARTERS,Somerset, Ky., December 12, 1861.

(Received December 16, 1861.)

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Division, Lebanon:

GENERAL: Having obtained much information relative to the face of the adjacent country, its roads, streams, and crossing, together with the ranges and haunts of the enemy, I would respectfully offer the following suggestion:

Let a respectable force move from Columbia along the road leading to Somerset until it reaches the salt-works, at the head of Fishing Creek by this time its movements will have attracted the attention of the enemy, now on the river near the mouth of this creek.

At this moment let me cross the river with the principal part of my force at a point due south of Somerset (which I can do). The enemy, on being crowded by the Columbia force, will attempt to recross the river, when, with that force in his rear and mine in front (south side of the river), his capture must be certain.

What do you say to this plan?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General.

DECEMBER 13, 1861.

General McCOOK, Camp Nevin:

I shall have a regular pontoon brigade ready for Munfordville to-morrow. but may not send if for the present. Will Johnson's arrangements make a brigade that can be depended on permanently? I don's want anything done in front that will attack any more attention than can be avoided, but be vigilant and ready, without even letting your command know it. Where is cross-roads?

Brigadier-General.

General NELSON, New Haven:

Get your division at the earliest possible moment, so that it called on it may move at once. Report by telegraph and mail what you require-ammunition, transportation, &amp;c.

Examine at once the roads in front of you in al directions.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General THOMAS, Lebanon:

What is your latest news from Schoepf, and what does he say? Has he changed position? What is the enemy's position?

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
