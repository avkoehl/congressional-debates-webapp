SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, August 9, 1864.

Generals THOMAS and HOWARD:

Schofield has his right division up to the enemy below Utoy Creek and south of East Point,and yet the enemy overlap him with redoubts and men. They must have more men than we estimate, or are thinly strung out;their line must be full fifteen miles long. Of course the bulk must be militia. I want our lines and flanks strengthened as much as possible with parapets and abatis, Thomas to get his 4 1/2-inch guns to work,and study the ground a little more before adopting new plans. We are as much extended now as is prudent.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 9, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have examined the cavalry reports. You will please organize all on your returns according to the best interests of the service, and I will instruct General Schofield to do the same. As soon as he gets a return I will order Colonel Hamilton to you or General Schofield. I think the latter, as General Schofield should have something in lieu of what General Stoneman lost. Colonel Capron, long missing, is at Marietta, and reports a good many scattered detachments coming in. You can increase your divisions of Generals Kilpatrick and McCook by calling forward some of the cavalry in Tennessee, which cannot be needed there, save to allay the fears of the old women. Forrest is in no condition to enter Tennessee, and General A. J. Smith is after him.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 9, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I will have to give General Schofield the Ninth Ohio Cavalry, Colonel Hamilton. With this regiment, and the wreck of General Stoneman's command, he can make a small brigade, enough to picket his flank on the Utoy Creek. If General Elliott has put the regiment on any kind of duty, please order him to have Colonel Hamilton to report to General Schofield.

General THOMAS:

Send me word when the 4 1/2-inch guns come, as I want to come over and watch the effect of a few of the first shots.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.
