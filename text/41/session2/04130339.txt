American Commerce—Mr. Negley.
here I may consistently introduce the next
important feature contemplated in the pro-
vision of the bill proposing to charter the
Mediterranean and Oriental Steam Navigation
Company.
IMMIGRATION.
IIow the ten millions added to our population
within the last fifty years have accelerated the
expansion of American civilization and power,
and have helped to realize the grandest con-
ceptions of those who commenced the structure
of our Republic, does not need any demon-
stration. They have anticipated the natural
growth of.our population and country by not
less than forty years, and only the southern
section of our vast country, on account of her
previous system of labor, has derived no com-
mensurate advantage from this influx. There
is no more forced and unrewarded industry in
the South now to compete with or rather ex-
clude independent labor; still there is as yet
but a small current of immigration flowing
toward the boundless natural advantages of
the southern States.
It is true there are some flourishing colonies
of old standing, as for instance the Moravians
in North Carolina, the French and Italians in
Louisiana, the Portuguese in Florida, and the
southern Germans in Texas, which have be-
come thoroughly acclimated, and form some
of the best and most respected elements in their
relative communities; and recently there have
been made extensive and very promising efforts
of settling in colonies, as among others, by the
Swiss in Tennessee, and by the Poles in Vir-
ginia. But these are limited exceptions to the
rule, and the peculiarities surrounding these
experiments, as well as other indications, prove
that the tide of immigration moves commonly
within the parallels of an isothermal zone, and
that the success of an colonial settlements abso-
lutely depends upon the climatieal congeniality
of the new homesteads with those of the former
home of the settlers.
The South greatly needs a healthy and eon-
genial immigration; but however great an
advantage such an access would be, not only
for that section, but for the entire country,
this advantage is precluded as long as there
is hardly any intercommunication between our
southern ports and those of Europe by'direct
lines.
The new line, proposing such connection,
will deal mainly with such countries as by cli-
matical and similar reasons might most likely
furnish that class of immigrants which will sup-
ply the deficiency in a manner most desirable
to the South and equally agreeable to the set-
tlers. From Italy alone thirty thousand per-
sons emigrated to South America in 1868, while
nearly all would have selected our southern
States if homestead provisions had been offered
them and the circuitous route of the present
line of travel had not been too expensive.
I commend to your attention the following
statistical table, showing the number of immi-
grants and passengers during 1867, 1868, and
1869 from countries lying within the isother-
mal zone of our southern States and southern
Europe, wherein the Mediterranean and Ori-
ental Steam Navigation Company proposes to
operate: %

'Estimated.
From these countries there have, in the last
three years, more than forty thousand immi-
grants arrived on our shores, of which it is safe
to assume that not more than four thousand, if
that many, have reached the South.
Among the various causes of this unequal
distribution it is by no means the least that
several^ of the southern States, as Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida,
within the territory of which there arc not less
than forty-nine million acres of public land,
are restricted by the act of June 26, i860, to
homestead entries. As long as the South can-
not secure her proportion of intelligent Euro-
pean immigration, not only her own growth in
population and prosperity will move tardily,
Ho. of keps.
I but also the harmony of our national^ inter-
' est will suffer. Consulting the last official au-
! thorities regarding our immigration during the
i quarter ending December 31, 1869. we find of
| 76,938 immigrants landed in the United States,
j there arrived in—
New Orleans      2,369
Baltimore 
Key West    3-;8
Charleston, South Carolina 
Savannah, Georgia    8
St. Mary's, Georgia  t,
St. John's, Floiida   1
Total    4,563
or not quite six per cent, of the aggregate jor
that section, which comprehends nearly halt of
the territory of our Union.
It is a moderate estimate, that by direct
steamer connection and other judicious pro-
visions this ratio would be quadrupled, or in
other words, instead of about eighteen thou-
sand immigrants per annum, the South would
receive an influx of not less than seventy
thousand.
Liberal homestead provisions accompanying
the priceless boon of civil liberty, educational
advantages, and material prosperity will soon
induce the frugal Italians, the industrious Swiss,
southern Germans and Austrians, the busy
Frenchmen and Spaniards, of whom every year
thousands emigrate to Brazil and other South
American States, to seek the sunny portion of
our Republic as more congenial to their customs
and pursuits. They will bring with them the
elements of their peasant and mechanical skill;
their experience in wine, silk, rice, and even
cotton culture and industry, and added to the
economical value of their experienced labor in
diversified branches and staples, a cash capital
of not less than $7,000,000 of gold per annum.
It is needless for me to weary you with quo-
tations from the highest politico-economical
authorities in favor of a national policy creat-
ing commerce and encouraging immigration to
that section ofour country so lately swept by the
tempest of civil war, and I proceed, therefore,
to another feature of importance,
OUR HOME INDUSTRY.
It is contemplated in the bill which invites
your attention and approval, Mr. Speaker,
that the ships of the proposed line shall be
constructed according to models dictated by
the Navy Department, from materials exclu-
sively the production of the United States;
that they shall be built in American ship-
yards and machine-shops, and that they shall
be adaptable alike for cheap conveyance of
passengers, merchandise, and mails in peace,
and for defense and aggressive measures in
time of war or public danger. It is further
provided that all vessels of this line shall bo
framed of iron and be propelled by steam.
The advantages of iron over wooden vessels
consist in their greater rigidity, durability,
buoyancy, capacity, and strength, and numeri-
cally expressed, amount to more than fifty per-
cent. The cost of building iron vessels in the
United States, because of the patronage be-
stowed upon England, exceeds, according to
reliable estimates, the ruling prices on the
Clyde by about thirty-three per cent.
The Delaware river, near Chester, and the
Ohio, near Pittsburg in Pennsylvania, would "
afford the most ample facilities for the con-
struction of iron ship-yards. All the ma-
terial required could be found at or cheaply
transported to these points, at the same time
all needed accommodations for the workmen,
or if other localities were found preferable,
then the iron plates and other metal parts
could be made after approved models and
shipped without waste and in required quan-
tities from our great workshops to the ship-
yards. The architect no longer accumulates
around his building stores of unfinished mate-
rial or adds to its cost unemployed capital,
but depends upon diversified industries for the
economical results of skill and capital applied
in proximity to the raw material.
CUT WE BUILD BETTER SHIPS.
Concerning the first voyage of the bark Iron
Age the Liverpool Journal of Commerce says:
" Wo have to announco the arrival of the splendid
new American bark Iron Apre, Captain Grabtrer,
from Galveston. This is the first iron vessel built
America, and she reflects great credit on her build -
crs." * * "She is clasped A Xo. !
for twenty yearb, and from licr beautiful lines ami
model she will hold her own witli any vessel that
lloaU."
The English vessels are inferior to ours in
quality of material and of construction.
