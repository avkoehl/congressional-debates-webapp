HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-2.10 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch received. I have made the preparations. A battery of four guns, thirteen cars loaded troops, and about 300 cavalry, passed to Petersburg this a.m., and I have been trying to ascertain ever since where they went from. Hartsuff says it was not from his front. I think it was from the Williamsburg road, and I have sent out to see. Deserters up to 3 o'clock this a.m. report no movement on my front.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

My scouts report that those troops moved from near the Williamsburg road. I see everybody that passes down the road to Petersburg. Unless I get different orders from you as soon as they take enough away there to give me a chance of success I will attack.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-2.50 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I suppose you are fully aware that troops can be taken away by the enemy between the Appomattox and Swift Creek, and on Curl's Neck, and that both places are practicably unassailable by me.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

In all to-day there have passed to Petersburg by the railroad and turnpike about 1,400 infantry, a four-gun battery, and about 300 cavalry. This does not decrease the force sufficiently to warrant an assault, in my opinion, with the force I have here.

General WEITZEL:

Firing was delayed this afternoon by flag of truce to bring in our dead and wounded between the lines. Truce was asked this morning, but not replied to until nearly 4 p.m. Reply was signed by Mahone.
