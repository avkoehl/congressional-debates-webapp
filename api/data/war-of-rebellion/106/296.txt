HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,Mesilla, January 28, 1863.

Captain BEN. C. CUTLER,

Assistan Adjutant-General, Santa Fe:

I have the honor to report the following progress in compliance with that protion of General Orders, Numbers 1, 1863, that refers to a campaign against Mangus Colorado's band of Gila Apaches. The duties assigned to the troops operating under the order named were deemed of sufficient importance to induce me to accompany the command in person and to remain with it as long as I though I culd be spared from the permanent headquarters of the district. Captain Edmond D. Shirland, First Cavalry California Volunteers, was detached on the 14th instant with twenty men of his comany, with orders to proceed at once in advance of the main body to find Mangus Colorado, known to be in the neighborhood of the Pinos Altos. Captain Shirland was to act according to his best judgment in either fighting the chief or getting him into his possession. He rejoined the command on the 18th instant at Fort McLane, bringing Mangus Colorado with him. Althugh the chief had to Captain Shirland the day previous claimed entire cominion over all the country usually ranged by his tribe, and complete authority over all its members, upon being confronted with one and being charged with the atrocities that they had committed, he protested his innocence and endeavored to evade the responsibility. He was made to understand that no such subterfuges would avail him, andthat his expressed desire for peace was only instigated by fear of the chastisement which he saw was about to be inflicted upon him and his people. I determined at once that, although the circumstnaces under which he had voluntarily placed himself in my power would not permit the taking of his life as some retributionfor his murders of our people, security for the future required that henever should have it again in his power to perpetrate such atrocities. He was told that the remainder of his days would be spent as a prisoner in the hands of the U. S. authorities; that his family would be permitted to join him, and that he and they would beHe was also distinctly told that upon making any attempt to escape his life would be the immediate forfeit. On the following morning at 1 o'clock he was shot dead by the guard, and his death was immediately reported to me. I investigated the matter at once. A sergeant and three privates of Company A, Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, becamehis guardat midnight. Wihin the succeedig hour he made three efforts to escape, and was shot on the third attempt. I have thus dwelt at length upon his matter in order to show that even with a murderous Indian, whose life was clearly forfeited by all laws, either humanor divine, wherever found, the good faith of the U. S. military authorities was in no way compromised. Manguns was to have returned to his tribe at an appointed time. His detention prevented this, and being apprehensive that his people would scatter, alarmed at his absence, I decided to pursue and punish them at once. The steps taken and their results are shown by the accompanying reports of Captains Shirland and McCleave, transmitted herewith. * Particular praise should be awarded to Captain Shirland and his command for the determination with which, despite of cold and hunger, they continued to seek the enemy for a much longer time and at greater distance than they went provided for, and the thorough execution of their work when they did finally track the Indians to
