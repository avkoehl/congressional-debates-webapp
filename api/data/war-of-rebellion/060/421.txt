And for land transportation I would arrange the above material, as follows:

Thirty-four pontoon wagons, each containing, 1 pontoon, 7 common balks, 1 anchor, 1 grease bucket, 1 extra tongue.

One pontoon-wagon (abutment), containing 14 claw-balks, 2 sills, 8 pickets, 1 anchor, 1 grease bucket, 1 extra tongue.
