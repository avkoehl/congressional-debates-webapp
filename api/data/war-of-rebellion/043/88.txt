WASHINGTON, D. C., July 9, 1863-3 p. m.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

The evidence that Lee's army will fight north of the Potomac seems reliable. In that case you will want all your forces in hand. Kelley is collecting at Hancock. I have directed him to push forward, so as to take part in the coming battle. Brook's militia refused to cross the Pennsylvania line. Everything I can get here will be pushed on to Harper's Ferry, from which place you can call them in to your left. Do not be influenced by any dispatch from here against your own judgment. Regard them as suggestions only. Our information here is not always correct. Take any horses or supplies you can find in the country. They can be settled for afterward. Would it not be well to fortify the Hagerstown Gap, through the South Mountain, as a part of the support?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 9, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

Two full regiments and two complete batteries are ordered to leave here to-night. Three brigades are on their way, and may be expected to-morrow or the day after. They will be sent to Harper's Ferry, unless you wish otherwise. I shall do everything in my power to re-enforce you. I fully appreciate the importance of the coming battle.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

(Received 9. 45 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Means of transportation and supplies required by the re-enforcements for this army being at Frederick, it would facilitate their junction with the army if the re-enforcement were sent to Frederick instead of Harper's Ferry.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 10, 1863-11. 20 a. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

You can stop at Frederick the re-enforcements ordered to Harper's Ferry. Those ordered hereafter will be directed to Frederick, at your request. I fear the three additional brigades may not reach here before to-morrow night.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
