The morning of the 10th found us in possession of Pleasant Hill, the enemy retreating secretly in the night, leaving his dead unburied and some 400 wounded in our hands. Bee took up the pursuit and held it for 20 miles without receiving a shot, capturing prisoners and finding at every step the same evidence of rout as had marked the pursuit of the previous day.

Thus was defeated this great expedition for the conquest of the Trans-Mississippi Department. The third army of the enemy in point of numbers on the theater of the war was routed and driven from the field with a loss of at least 10,000 men. These great results, due alone to the valor of the army under my command, were accomplished at great sacrifice of life. Both in numbers and in quality has the loss been heavy to the country. A consolidated report* of the casualties of the two battles accompanies this report. The report of the cavalry corps is omitted, the active nature of their service preventing prompt returns. The casualties of the cavalry will swell the whole loss to 2,500.

I cannot speak too highly of the services rendered during the two day's operations by my staff. Major Surget, assistant adjutant-general, who was with me in all the hard-fought actions of the Valley campaign, distinguished himself highly. So did Lieutenant Hunter, aide-de-camp, and G. L. Fusilier and T. J. Williams, volunteer aides. The latter gentleman, formerly sheriff of De Soto Parish, was very useful from his intimate acquaintance with the country. Captain Stevens, assistant quartermaster at Alexandria previous to the advance of the enemy, accompanied me on both days and was active and zealous in the transmission of orders. The same can be said of Lieutenants Chambers and Williams, of Benjamin's company, performed excellent service, as did their men, and are entitled to honorable mention. Of Major J. L. Brent, chief of artillery and ordnance, an officer always in the right place at the right time, I have previously spoken, as well as of the meritorious conduct and efficiency of Chief Surgeon McKelvey, Major Sanders, and Major Mason. Captain May, acting assistant adjutant-general, remained at Mansfield and contributed much by his energy and good judgment tot eh preservation of order and the general efficiency of all branches of the service. Surgeon Egan, inspector of hospitals for this district, was in charge of the Mansfield hospitals, and did much to mitigate the sufferings of our wounded. Surgeon Yandell, medical director of the department, placed his energy and high professional skill at my disposition and was of incalculable use to us. Taking charge of the hospitals at Pleasant Hill, he speedily perfected arrangements for the proper care of the wounded at that point. Surgeon Hooper, president of the medical board, with Surgeon Lawrence and Surgeon Scott, followed Surgeon Yandell to Pleasant Hill and assisted in the good work. I was deprived of the very valuable services of Major William M. Levy, assistant adjutant and inspector general, never before absent from the field since I assumed command in this State. Confined to his tent by severe illness, Major Levy was only able to contribute to our success by the assistance he gave Captain May at Mansfield.

I desire especially to call attention to the high character and service of Majors surget and Levy. Distinguished time and again for
