Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

General Banks is at Williamport, with his force in much better condition than was expected, and without having suffered any great loss. We have a large force at Harper's Ferry, and that place is reported to be secure. A large concentration of our forces at Manassas has been made. Reports from Harper's Ferry indicate that the rebel forces have fallen back in apprehension of the movements now being made to capture them. It is not believed that there is any present danger of an aggression of the enemy is Pennsylvania. The forces being raised by the Government are designed for service in the field remote form your State, and in view of the apprehension of the enemy in Pennsylvania. The forces being raised by the Government are designed for service in the field remote from your State, and in view of the apprehension expressed in your telegram of last evening, that the Pennsylvania troops may be needed for your own defense, the President will not require any other from Pennsylvania to be mustered into the U. S. service but those who volunteer for three years or during the war, leaving all others to meet any emergency that may hereafter arise for your domestic protection, as you seem to think such protection is needed.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, May 27, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Can you not specify the number of men that will be required from Pennsylvania under late call? We are likely to be overrun.
