Mr WRIGHT then inquired if it was in order
to move to take up the bill making appropriates
'or the civil and u plomalic expenses of the Go-
vernment for the ytar 1841
The VICiS PRESIDENT answered in the affir-
mative
Mr WRIGHT. Then I make that motion, and
I give not ce that I will not withdraw it
The bill above named was then taken up, ard

Mi HLjNDERSON then prope'sed an amend-
ment relative to the eompersatioa of\officers inAe
federal court , wh'ch was rpposad by /Mr
WRIGHT, and dispgreed to—A>es 5,\oes JT4
The amendments next in older were th\ e>offered
by Mr Anderson, the first of which proposed to
make it obligatory on every collector of custom^
naval officer, and surveyor, to render a quarterly
account of all sums of money received or collected
for fines, penalties, forfeitures, or seizures of goods,
or on account of suits instituted for frauds against
the revenue laws, &c &c. and to limit the remu-
neration of the collector to $6,000, the naval of-
ficer to $5,000, and the surveyor to $4,500.
Mr. PRENTISS spoke in favor of the amend-
ment
Mr CALHOUN said he always heard the Se
nator ñ\m Vermont wi h the gieatest attention,
and he re-ponded to every word that Senator had
now uttered. H" (Mr. Calhoun) should be glad
to sec this Government brought back to its original
simplicity, and he trusted the time had now come
to bring these officers. d">wn If ihey wished to al-
lay the excitement of their Presidential contests,
this was tne time, and this the way to do Uj for so
long as these u mpting prizes were put m the wheel,
the excitement would continue Gentlemen oppo-
lt  had ir timated a disposition to put the country
ni a postuie of de'ence, in which he concurred, and
he should be glad to s=e it done systematically; and
he begged to call Ihe attention of honorable gentle-
men to the fact, that every r'ollai they saved from
tieso cfheeis would be so much added to their
means to put the coun'ry in a state of defence.
But at Ihe same ume, he took occasion lo 'ay, he
should net enter m'o any scheme of defence, mi-
le s some general principles were settled by emi-
nent military and nival officers- when this was
done, he was prepared, -and should be on all occa-
sions, to advance in a course of systematic policy,
and to place tin c untry where it ought to stand
among the na'nms Oi the earth
Mi ANDERSONS!, d, that he should be gra i-
ned, undir pn p i circumstance-, to enter into
ihe di c u* ion ot thi whole subject, but the time
of ihe Senate was piecious and be would confine
turns* It strictly to a ver., brief statement of the ob-
j cts of the amendment He had conferred wi h
several ot his friends m relation to that part of it
which comprehended fine", penalties, and forfeit-
ures, and, with a view to obviate any reasonable
objection, he had struck it out altogether, although
he beheved that it would be proper to modify the
existing laws even in that respect. The main ob-
j ct of the amendment was, to curtail the vast sa-
laries now received by the collectors, naval officers,
and su'veyors, and to put into practical operation
the law of 1822 This, ne said, was but carrying
out the purpose contemplated by that, and had
leei suggested by the recent development- id New
York, m regaid to the late c Hector of that port
There was but a single rem in this which
was not to be found, in tiuth, within the
intention of the act of 1822 The terms of limi-
tation u ed in that were desgnel to cover the
whole «alary of those officers, as then fixed, but it
seem- that there has been a material departure from
the objecis expres-ed in the law, and in conformity
wi'h the principle laid down m a recent decision of
one of Ihe circuit courts of the United States, the
collector of New York claims a large sum of pub-
lic money Thit. amendment, he said, gave the
mo=tampl> «alanés to the officers referred to, and
provides against impositions, such as have been
practised upon the Government heretofore There
was but a single item, as he had slated, that of
storage, which was not comp ehended by the act of
1S22 The manner m which that bad been made
a si urce of large income, narticularly m the city of
New Yoik, was highly reprehensible, and this
amendment in tint regard, i«¡ wiended to remedy
the evil by subjecting it to legal regulation. He
said, he trusted that the amendments would meet
with tbe general support of Senators as tr-e means
of reform.
In concluso", he would ask for the ayes and
noes on hi- amendment.
