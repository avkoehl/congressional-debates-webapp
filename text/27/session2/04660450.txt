CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
law  the greater was the propriety that the provision ehould re-
mam m the bill, and thus lessen the expenses of printing
Sir WOODBURY said the provision in the appropriation
bill of 1839 went to limit thediscietion of the officers of the va
nous departments, so as to compel them toeet the punting
done oit the lowest terms, instead of allowing them to have it
done tffhere they pleased-, and directed that they should
advertise for proposes, and contri a for the work with
the lowest bidder The law he thought was open to the con
struction enher that it was intended to be permanent or tem
porary In consequence of that provision of 1S39, however,
Several oí the departments advertised for bids foi executing the
printing for two years, not considering it an annual or tem-
porary provision, but a permanent one He had understood
that some of the departments under" the present Administration
had adopted the construction given to that provision under the
late Administration and authonzed new contracts undei it, and
that others had construed it as a temporary act, and had aban
doned the contract system under it So far as his experience
of the benefits of it was concerned he staled that he had been
Called upon to repoit what had been the fifFect of its operations,
and after getting reports Jrom the heads of buieaus, of a cotí
panson  C the expenses 01 the two modes, he repoi ted to Con
gress that, by the contract &ystem, under a provision similar to
xhe one proposed 10 be striken out there had been a saving of
twenty per cent to the Government
Mi EVANá did not wish to protract the discussion on that
point, but he still leraired im opinion Hehid not seen the íe
poitof the Senatoi from New Hampshire alluded to, but the ie
port of the .Secretaiy of State, m ule at the same time, was, that
the law was worthless, and had no benefici it eh\.cc foome con
tracted to do portions of the wo k at a lower rate than it was
done for before, and for other portions o/ the woik the Govern
ment had to pay a higher rate Upon the whole, that tht mode
was vexatious, and of no practical benefit
Mr MANGDM said thatt upon an examuntjon of the bill of
1839, he was not at all surprised that the law had been acted
Upon by the Senatoi from New Hampahue as a permanent
one The present proviso) it would be seen, introduces the
same hmg in different language, it could not admit of misap
piehension He asked the yeas and nays upon the question,
which were ordered
Mr WOGDUURY here read the enactment of the appropn
auon bill of 1839, m reference to the printing required by the
public depaitments, in which it was piovided that it should be
thus executed till otheiwise dnected by law The words
"until otherwise directed by law," are, in his opinion, put in the
bill to preclude the inference that it was intended to be tempo-
rary
The question was then taken by yeas and na> 8 on striking out
the proviso relative to tin- printing, and it was negatived by
yeas 9, nays 28, as fol low*
YEAS—Messrs Kate , Bayaid, Choate, E^ans, Merrick,
PheJjn Preston, Rivt-s, and lallmadpc— 9

Sprague, Sturgeon, Tappan, Walker, Whi e, Woodbury, and
Wright—-3
The question now recurring on sulking out the second pio-
viso above quoted,
Mr MANGUMsaid, m reference to the second proviso he
could not see how the busine&s of the departments could be con
ducted in a manner at all compatible with efficiency unless they
were permitted by Congiess to increase their foiu, a& occasion
may require
Mr HUNTINGTON expressed the belief that the) would
find it difficult to be furnished with inform ition, for winch con
tinual applications were made to tlu department*, unless th it
proviso wereic}ectid
Mr WOODBURY said he thought the la-t clause of the
second ptoviso, after the word (them " should h* stucken out
The remainder of the pioviso wasprupti, and might be allowed
to stmd
The question now beim* on sinking out the second blanch of
the proviso, from line 96 to Une 94, it wasagieedto strike out
that part
The second amendment was lead, as follows Paffe 5, in
Bert, after line 94, 'for amount due, in addition to foitner íppro
pnaiioiiff, for compiling, rrmtmg, and binding B ennial Regis
ter. sixteen hundred and forty five dollars and nftj cent* '"
Mr EVANS explained that this was a residue oi a ¡ency
to pay foriepnntmgthe Register, aftev innumerable er.ois m
the first print had been corrected,
Mr WRIGHT asked if he underwood the Senatoi that the
estimate for the first printing waa S1,000 It so, why was the
second printing somuchmoreexpensive'í
Mi EVANS answered that there were more pages and ad
ditional printing
Mr WOODBURY inquired if the printing had been adver
used for.
Mi   LVANS was notable to answer !ln question
Mr HUNTINGTON thought theie wd> t mistake a^ to the
estimate He believed the estimate foi the Just printing was
SI 600
Mr WRIGHT said that was hi  own impression lib thought
th" usual e timife *a&fiom $1,500 to $1 SCO, but did not know
whethei, by adveuismg, competition rnigh' not hive brought
down the contract to $1,000
Ml WOODBURY thought it would be well to pa^s that mat
ter over till there was time to make inquiry into the facts It
vas v- rt-unly desirable u ascertain whether the contract was
made after advertisement
Mr EVANS considered the facte indisputable that the work
was done, and necessary to be done, and theamount being with
in the customary estimates, and but small, it was not necessary
to delay for any result the inquiry was likely to lea 1 to
The amendment was then adopted, with an understanding
tha.,inquiry should be made before the bill was repoited back
ta the Senate
The next amendment to s nke out' fifty and m &rt *sixtj "
m line 253, page 11, was agieed to, making a diffeience of $10,
i n the sum lor the repairs of the long bridge
The next was page 15, ¡me 329 to stnke out "two" an 1 in
serf'ten," making an mciease of gS,000 for compensaron of
workmen in the New Orleans branch mint.
This also, was agreed to.
^be next was, same page, line 334, after ' thousand " to m
Bert "sixHundred," adding so much for iron rods m the New
üj:leau ^ranc> jnmt,
This was also agreed to.                 nAn                                     ,
The next was, in same page, line 348, to strike out the word
"furniture," so that no part of the appropriation of £20,000 for
the expenses of the Legislative Assembly of Wisconsin Terii
toiv should be applied to the purchase *f furniture
Mr EVANS obbeived that hitherto great wastefulness had
occuired in the loose mannej- of making appropriations fcrthe
Territories Eveiy yeai this estimate of $3 000 for furniture
came up, was sanctioned by Congiess, and wasaferwaids
otherwise applied This arose out of the practice if
handing over the whole sum appropriated , which was, dis
bursed by order cf the Legislative Assembly, without any
control of the Trea^i ry Department The appropriation foi
this $3,000 worth of furniture had leen rrade year after year,
yet in no instance had the money be°n so applied, but still the
general sum appropriated was always spent, and too onen
arrearages incurred He was opposed to «anctior apiropria
tions in one name, to he applied in anodiei Ifihe whole sum
called for was necessary fer the Government oí Wisconsin, let
U be appropriated for that purpose
The amendmentwasadopted
The next was, same pace, line 349, after "twenty" lo insert
"one," and after "thousand" to insert' eight hundrtd and eigh
ty seven," being to add $ 1 887 to the $20 000 lor compensation,
mileage and other expenses oí the Legi^at ve Council oí Wis
cor sin Te-ntory
Mi EVANS explained the necessity foi thi* ' iciease
Mr CRITTENDEN was opposed to it He ronsideiel it
quite unneces^aiy and extiavagant He could see no rea
son why the Government ol WibCOnMn shoul 1 coat one dollar
ovei ihb $20,000 provided, when tl e Oo\ en ment*? of o nany
States did not cost the States tiem^ehts any thing hke that
sum
Mi MANGUMtoncumd with the Fena'or Aom Kentucky
He insisted on the propriety of stnkir gout irom evt.13 general
appiopuation bill all extra ovvancesoranearages The prop
ei course was lo allow each claim of the kind to be brought up as
a distinct proposition, ard let the ra^e be c early made out to
the satisfaction of Congiesg If it was, theie could be no doubt
that justice would be done
Mr SEVI.ER said the wlio'e of these propositions for paying
the mileage, per diem, printing, &c of the lotall egiUatures of
the Territories weie agióse innovation, ard ought to be stopped
at once He stated the expe ^sea of Aikansas while a Ternto
ry, and showed that she paid all the expenses of her Geneial
Assembly herself But this innovation grew up in the extra
prosperous time of lS35-'6 He was disposed to go as far as
the law allowed butnofuither
Mr EVANScicplamed that these ap, ropnations were made
in confoimity with organic laws He igieed u'th the Senator
fiom Noun ( ar ina, [Mi Ma**gim ] that theie ^honlfi he a

Mr bEVIER observed that he had  -een estim uts that the
expense oí the Legi&lilive Assembly was^iOOOO How could
that be, and so lew to pay7
Mr. E^aNS pn[ lamed that the greater part of that amount

Mi rVANls thought theie weie nany abuses, and that the
1 teasury Derailment &hould mves i?ate the accounts of the
Teintonts, and disallow evei y item not allowed by tlieorga ^c

Mr HUNTINGTON mtr lone1 the estimates for ia39 and
1940 andtaid hesawno íei^on for fíceedf g the appropiiation
made m the Hon«ie bill lie thought the btst way would be to
make the appropi latioiis spec he t  agree w th the estimates
Mr WOODBURY hoped the chairm m would waive his mo
t < n, and let the appropriation «¡tand the same a=t that of pie
viousyeais The only cure tor the evil complained of was
that of limiting each demand to t'ie estimate, or by specific
legislation
1 ne amendment was then negatived
The next was page 16—to strue out, from lire 366, all after
"dollars1 viz
' And for the arrearages of expenses for the Legislative As
sembly of the Territ ry of low for the present and previous
>ear", thirteenthoiihdud four hundíesdand twenty one dollars
Provided, Thati part of this appropriation «hall be u&ed foi
the payment of the membeia of the said Legislttive Assembly
for per diem waget. mneaoe, ov extia ei vn,e% or f stationery
for their individual use "
Mr EVAN-^ explained t^iat it wa=i tie opinion of the com
mittee that all the Terntoues el ould be place J on the same
foo ing, leaving specific claims for apecific legislation.
The amendment was agteed to
The next amen ment was to st ¡ke from page 22 of the bill
the sum of $375,000 for defraying theexpeme1! of the Judiciary,
and to insert $4?500Q, thus increasing the appropiiation
©100 000, for expenses consequent on the enactment of the bank
iiiptlaw
Mr EVANS observed that the committee fe't satisfied th-t
notle*sthrin ®47o,000 would suffice for carr>mg the ludicial
Department through this year in consequence of the £reat m
cieate of expense occasioned by the increase ot busi le^sfrom
the operation of the bankrupt law
Mr OR11TENDEN was surprised to heai this. rea«on as
signed for surh an alaimmg increase to th« expenditure of the
Judicial Department He could not see how the operation of
the oankrupt law could authorize anv increase of expense to
this Government The silanes of the judges were not to be
incieased The other officers would be enmnenssted by in
creased fees from increased busmen Who,'', then, was there
to justifv an additional expense of £100 000?
Mr gFVirR had leceivei^ a commu nration from Arkansas
and he could account ior some of the increase He understood
the d strict attorneys and clerks w ei getnng $5 a day each, and
that u was to contioue for everv day m the year
Mr EVANS supposed the officeis of the district courts were
necessarily called upon by the operation of the bankrupt iaw
to pei form a large amount of additional business, and it was
therefore necessary to compensate them for the additionally
bor, or to pay the clerks they were obliged to employ to dis-
charge that business
Mr CRITTENDEN could not see why the Treasury of the
United fctates should he burdened with this increased expense,
a« the fees of office would be increased with the business, and
furnish ample compensation.
Mi LVaN  nniher exp amed.that the expenses yere in-
curred under the supervision of the courts, andadditional clerks
had to bt employed He understood that more thar half the
amount of this large appiopuation of three or four hundred
thousand dollars was i ent on j uries, in consequence of the vast
incieaseol business intheEtdeial courts
Mr HUNTINGTON aaked if any thina additional was to be
oaidto the judges, as he understood the Knator from Arkansas
to allude to somesuch thing
Mr FVANS said theie was nothing additional for thejudges
Mr SEVIER explained that he alluded to the additional pay
to attorneys, cleiks marshals, &c
Mr KING obsei ved that this was an exemplification of the
beautiful system of the bankrupt law enforced upon the coun-
tiy It was right hat the expense of this system should be
known he wou'd iheiefore propose that the appropriation be
div ded inte two distinct heads—one showing that the appropii-
ation or ©100000 was for the expenses of the bankrupt law
Mr WOODBURV showed the annual increase of the expen-
ditures tor the judicial department for years past, and even m
the present tstimate independent of the $100000 for thp ex-
penesofth bankiupt law, potwithotandirgMr Clay's famous
resolution of irtienci ment in this pat ucular The only way to
pi event th «indefinite inciease is for Congressto limit the sum
thot shall be ex, tnoed It seemed to be agreed on all hands
that some letter enment on this held was loudly called for,
but Vi^en action was den anded it -ppeired to bealwaysout of
reason—eithei too hot or too cold—as if the time" for retrench-
ment never was to be arnved at
Mi EVAi\  went into fuither explanation, to snow how
many of the=.e expenses were mevi able, and occasioned by the
Increasing expendes oí he ccurts
Mr CRITTENDEN would be obliged to the gentleman, if
he had the items of tl is esti T>ate ¡or the ©100,000 on account of
the bankiupt Uw to state them
Mr EVANS was not prepared to furnish items, he did not
believe there were any
Mr CRITTENDEN was entirely opposed to this assifmption
of the expenses ol the bankrui t law 1 hat law nade no such
picvition foi the payment of clerks and oficers as $5 a day
He utteily repudiated the idea that eithei the clerk or attorney
of any district c< urt could have any claim for extra allowance.
He would repeat, that the increase of business would bring an
increase of fees and, c msequen'Iy, an ample compensation
If such appropriations are to be made, and peisisted in, against
all remonstrance the Trea^uiy mu t remain in a hopeless state,
und the 'oan lately authouaed would soon be exhausted If,
under the opeiation ol the bankrupt law, any officer is entitled
to compensation for additional duty it must be the ludge, for
he dres not participate in the incitase of fees fiom increased
business
J he ques ion was hen put and the amendment was rejected
The next amerdment proposed was to strike out from the
twenty second page of the bill the following "Provided, how
ever, That the district attorrey of the ssuthein district of
New York, and the clerk of the district and circuit courts of
said dibtrict shall ool, a any time hereafter, retain of tneir fees

tenet of com per satu n loth u deputies, nor shall they, or either
of them, retam undei any pretence whatsoever, more than the

not to exceed i& to either of said offices in said district, the sum
of three thousand dollars pei year, and shall pay the residue of
their lees and emoluments into the Treasury of the United
fctates an 1 said distnc attorney, cleik, a1 d marshal shall ren-
der to the Secietaiv of the Ireasury, under their oaths, in such
form as he shall pi escribe, a semi annual account of all fees
and emoluments rece'ved or earned by Lnem, or either of them,
and the al owance for compensation to the deputies of said
marshal *hal 1 hereafter be made by the Secretary of the Treasu-
ry instead of said court, who shall require a statement, under
oath, fiom said marshal, that such sums, so claimed to be al
lowed for said deputies, have actually and in good faith been
paid to them "
Mi * VANS stited that this appropriation did not differ from
that of last session, wi*h the exception of the limitation of
©3000 for assistants He thought it was purely a question
whethei that sum would be sufficient to meet the increased ex
penses consequent upon such an augmentation of business as
must take place in a court like that of the southern district oí
New Yoik The district attorney states that, wi h every effort
to economize the exti a expenses last year were $5,000, and could
not this year be brought lower than &4 000, so that, limiting the
sum to $3 0 0 would be subjecting him toa loss of $1 000 out
of his own salary of $6 000 He is obliged to employ nine as-
sistant clerks
Mi KING observed that the great abuse was, that the most
L-normous ebaigesfor sen ices not peiformed had been certified
tv the judges, and thus thou ando on thousands of dollars
were paid away, involvingm theaggicgate a vast amount
Surely this showed the necessity oí making the limitation
The Senator fears that no competent person would undenake
the duties of the office for £5 000 instead of $6 000 He ven
tured to say that a thousand competen individua a would be
found re^dy and willing o take it at $4 000 instead of $3,000
Mr   EVANS observed that the mistake was in supposing
that the expense fell on the Government    This was not so
fie fund arose oiu of fees received and collected by the dis
tnctattorne} and his clerk f t their labors, and the Govern
ment paid no more than its «shaie of fees, according to the suits
in which itwasengiged The íequisitmn was, that the attor
ney and clei lis should pay over t<  the G >vemmeni ail excess
of their fees ahoye a limited amount He denied that there
was any ex ravigant exper ditures certified by thejudges
Mr BUCHANAN said in his opinion, there was no branch
of the public expendituieb which required correction so nitrcfi
as that of the judiciary It had nsen rapidly from year to year,
until it had reached the amount of nearly half a million and it
was now proposed to mcieaseitby the addition of ¿190,000
He, (Mr Buchanan) from pe<*u'iar circumstances, had reason
