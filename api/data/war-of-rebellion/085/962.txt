COLONEL: My command is encamped three-fourths of a mile from this place toward Ironton. There is a creek about a mile beyond my camp, toward Ironton, which will be suitable for a camp for General Fagan. I met General Shelby here this morning and presume he will encamp near here. The Federals met a force of General Shelby's command here this morning and turned off toward Webster. I am preparing a force to follow them as soon as my men can obtain forage, &c.

Very respectfully,
