Department for the twelve months ending the
1st of March, 1870 ? The following table will
answer the question:
ExTPtnditvre* on account of the Navy Department from
March 1,1869, to February 28,1870, inclusive.

Let us compare the expense of the Navy thus
shown in its present organization with what it
was in 1859-60, a period of peace like the pres-
ent. We find—
Amount of appropriations for 1850-60...,$14,077,644 62
Deductions und transfers  1,776,983 52
Difference. 12,800,661 10

Total .$15,375,626 37
It will thus be seen that theamourtt reported
by the committee, though nearly etghtmiilions
less than the eBtimates of the Department for j
the present year, does not veiy largely exceed |
the expenditures of,18G0, after, making due
allowance for the increase in priees. 1 think
if the expenditures can bekoptwithin tbatsum,
or even if they da not exceed it by -more than
twp or three millions, w« shall,: solong as we
keep oar Nayy to its present standard, have
no reasonable ground of complaint in the i
amount of theaggregate expenditure,and need
have no reasonable apprehension of its Want
of efficiency.
But it. becomes-a material and important
question whether we cannot properly reduce
-our naval establishment, and in that way econ-
omize the public expenditures in the future.
Addressing ourselves to this quostion, and
recollecting that we are now at peace with all
the warldjietua institute a comparison of the
strength of our Nayy in 1860 *nd 1870, We
shall find the fallowing result:

. By the last ,annual report of the Secretary
,of the Natvy.it appears that eighty-six vessels
were repaired and refitted for «ea from March
to December, 2$69, constituting a force nearly
as la g$oOa the whole navy i« I860, and an
armameut largely in excess of the vesseteact-
ually in commission «t the laat-namedperiod.
Having thus,-shown,: by. comparison, the
strength of ourjmval«rmament attheextremes
of the last decade, both being in timaof peace,
let us continue the somparison :by an exam-
ination of the official force employed at our
navy-yards for the same lime. This will give
#s some idea-«f th«i,great in«rease of expense
to which the people are subjected through the
operations of the yards. We Bhall see by this
comparison what was required to officer them
in 1860, compared with the present comple-
ment. I have taken some pains to make the
following tables minute and accurate, draw-
ing my information from the Navy Register of
the two years in question, because I want this
House and the country to see what kind of
naval establishments they are called upon to
appropriate money for, and the extraordinary
disparity between "now and then." I do this
in the firm conviction that we ought to address
ourselves to the duty of bringing down expendi-
tures by a proper reduction of the force and
amount of this branch of the public service.
That I may not be thought partial I commence
with the navy-yard in my own State. Look
at the picture:

Mr. MAYNARD. In 1860 was not the
' captain the highest grade in the service ?
Mr. STEVENS. I am very glad the gentle-
man has made that suggestion, because it gives
me an opportunity to advert to the inquiry
!; which I suppose bis question is intended to
i suggest, why we should maintain in time of
; peace this great number of rear admirals, cre-
ated in time of war amd for warlike purposes.
Mr. MAYNARD. I merely called the gen-
i tleman's attention to the feet that at the time
referred to officers of the highest grades were
taken to command navy-yards, while now we
take what I may call the highest grade in active
se^vioe, toTvit, the-Tear admirals.
Mr. STEVENS. • I preBume there will be"
no antagonism between the gentleman and
myself bn this point. It may be quite proper
that rear admirals should be placed in com-
mand of navy-yards, because while we have
those officers we must employ thetn, and we
have nothing else for them to do.
Mr. MAYNARD. Whether it would be wise
in a reorganization of the official force to bare
these two 'grades is a different question.
Mr. STEVENS. Thstt is the very point to
whieh I want to call attention—whether we
should not now by act of Congress stop pro-
motions, and lessen in the future the number
of these higher grades, which bring^ with them
not only rank but large pay.
I do not propose to follow this comparison
further. I have taken the navy-yards proper
fear the purpose of comparison, omitting the
hospitals, rendezvous, marine guard, and naval
asylums; but it will be found, if the investiga-
tion is pursued into these organizations, that a
like disparity of strength exists, in which the
preponderance is largely in favor of the present
year of 1870.
NAVV-TABDS. r -
And bow, Mr.'Chairman, a word in regard
to nayy-yards. I believe, sir, that What we
have got, including such as may be (fitted up
on the sites already owned by the: Government
as fast as others may be sold and removed,,iare
amply sufficient for us even, in time of -war, and
more than sufficient in a time of profound peace
like the present undisturbed period. Why, sir,
we have.got more navy-yards in active opera-
tion to-day than we had during the war, when
.Ndrfolk and Pensacola were not available for
