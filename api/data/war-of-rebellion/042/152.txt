mounted either en barbette or casemate, and whatever guns are substituted in the place of those removed. These should be ready, so that the withdrawal of the guns may not be observed. We can ill afford to lose men with arms or cannon on wheels. You will, therefore, make arrangements to withdraw safely the guns from Saluria, should it become necessary. Lieutenant-Colonel Shea was of opinion that it can be easily done.

The two guns at Aransas Pass will be allowed to remain, inasmuch as they are necessary for the defense of that place, and there are not guns there which are not on wheels.

Returned prisoners from Vicksburg, Fort Pickens, and other points occupied by the enemy report that the operations of the armies of Grant and Banks will not be extended in this direction before the fall. Meantime I am pushing rapidly the defensive preparations here. The necessary labor, which has been withheld until recently, is coming in freely. It is hoped that the supply of ammunition which I shall be able to provide will suffice for a siege, if necessary. Subsistence stores are coming in plentifully.
