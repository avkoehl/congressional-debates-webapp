they immediately deployed for the purpose of attacking it. At this moment the enemy opened a severe fire from this wing of their works, which was returned by the companies. Companies A and B advanced to within about 100 feet of this wing of the works.

Whilst Companies A and B were thus engaged Company C approached the main works parallel with the corn field, and had got within 100 yards of the work. A signal was sounded to retire, which they did in good order, and proceeded to join the balance of the regiment. The wounded in this engagement is shown by tabular statement attached.* After the regiment had been together some time in the rear of McAfter battery, Colonel McCook ordered it to fall farther back, to avoid the grape and canister shots to which its position exposed it. It then retired to the clear space on the east side of the next field to await orders. In about one hour the regiment was again order forward to charge the enemy's works, and proceeded to a point about 200 yards west of the corn field aforesaid and a short distance to the right of the main road leading to the enemy's works, where it was halted until night-fall. Then the regiment was ordered to cover the return of the artillery from the woods to camp. One-half of the regiment was deployed through the woods on the right of the road, the balance on the road to the left. After the artillery and all the ambulances were brought from the field, the regiment, about 9 o'clock, joined the balance of the Second Brigade, and went into camp at the place from which it had started at 3.30 o'clock p. m. to charge the enemy's works.

About 2.35 p. m. I was ordered to send one field officer, with five companies, to Cross-Lanes for observation. I detailed Lieutenant-Colonel Becker, who started forthwith. Soon after, the firing becoming quite lively, I was order forward in double-quick. I came up with Lieutenant-Colonel Becker's command, drawn up in line on the right of the road, ordered in to fall in with the regiment, and moved forward to the rear and left of the artillery.

After 5 o'clock, the fire slacking somewhat, I was ordered by General Rosecrans, in person, to move my regiment, with four companies of the Thirteenth and a detachment of the Twenty-third Ohio Regiments, guided by Colonel Smith, in a direction to the left of our position, and after rounding a hill to our right to charge and take the works of the rebels about sunset, an attack from our right to be made at the same time. I marched the column down the ravine as directed, halted, and waited for Colonel Smith to guide the column. One hour and twenty minutes after my arrival at the foot of the hill Colonel Smith ascent in two ranks over very steep and slippery rocks, through thick under-
