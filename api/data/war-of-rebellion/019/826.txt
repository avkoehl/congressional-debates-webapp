James P. Evans, Hospital Steward W. N. Evans, and Private James Pidey, members of the regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles, commanded by Colonel John Drew, and William Reese, a member of the regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles, commanded by Colonel Stand Watie, were taken prisoners by the United States, and are still held as such; and whereas 7 United States soldiers were taken prisoners on the 6th of the same month, near Bentonville, Ark., by the command of Colonel John Drew, and were delivered to the officers of the Confederate States, and it is believed were subsequently exchanged: Therefore be it.

Resolved, That the Principal Chief be requested to present these facts to the President of the Confederate States, and solicit his interference and aid in obtaining the release, by exchange or otherwise, of the before-named officers and privates, and any others, if there be such, belonging to said Cherokee regiments.

Resolved, That in the opinion of the National Council, the war now existing between the said United States and the Confederate States and their Indian allies should be conducted on the most humane principles which govern the usages of war among civilized nation, and that it be and is earnestly recommended to the troops of this nation in the service of the Confederate States to avoid any acts toward captured or fallen foes that would be incompatible with such usages.
