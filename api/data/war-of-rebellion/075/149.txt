Major-General STONEMAN:

I have just ordered Colonel Butler, Fifth Indiana Cavalry, to move to Ringgold and to aid the forces at that place if defense became necessary. The rebels are more likely to try Parker's Gap. The large columns have returned to Dalton. My opinion is that the whole thing is a diversion, though a raid may be attempted.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
