Dispatch tothe geenral received. He left here yesterday for Drewry's with brigade of infantry and regiment of cavlary. Left me temporarily in command; establish headquarters where necessarya and report to War Deaprtment. Am trying to protect roads from raid; sent two regiments to South Side Junctinl; two regiments on Wilmington and Weldon road. Will be short of rations and ammunition. Movements of enemy indicate this place to be attacked from north of Appomattox.

It is very weak.

Fear enemy will cut South Side Railroad to- day and Weldon and Petersburg. No telegraph south of Weldon; supplies there.

GenerL BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

By observing, enemuy's left rests at Cobb's, on the river, and extends, strongly intrnched, by Howlett's to Dutch Gap, on James, with strong outposts at Craig['s, Walthall Junctin, and Clay's, thsu presenting the face of their left wing to me, and not rear as supposed. If they swing, with right on James, then only do they present left flank and rear. Positon from Cobb's to railroad is very strong, a d with this force uanssailabel. Can uyou advise me of time your movement will commence!

WHITING,

General.

Gener	L BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Following dispatch just received from ivor Station:

The latest informaiton places the enemy near Windsor at 9.30 this morning about 15,000 strong. Colonel Taliaferro's regiment not yet arrived; daily expected. I do not think they have the force reported, though it may be true. It would probably be prudent to send that Ninth or Seventy- first North Carolina Regiment down. I am prepared tomeet them should they coame this way. Will send other scouts across this evening to feel this strength. Have not learned their cavalry force. Fear they have captured there of my scouts near Suffolk.

J. D . RADCLIFFE,

Colonel, Commandng.

Major-General, Commanding.
