positive information. The party on Palmyra road went a mile beyond Wilmington; met their picket-line half a mile this side of town, and drove them through town and one mile beyond, together with some thirty soldiers loafing about the place. They were re-enforced from up the road, and the scouting party came back. The rebel Colonel Nelson is collecting the country people at Palmyra, but Lieutenant Mitchell, commanding the party, thinks there is no organized party there or in the vicinity. The men he met and skirmished with the thinks were not regular soldiers but farmers, deserters, &amp;c. These scouting parties consisted of twenty men each. I think there is no force either at Goochland or Palmyra.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. L. FITZHUGH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
