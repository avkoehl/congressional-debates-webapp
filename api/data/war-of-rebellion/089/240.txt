GENERAL: It will be necessary you should extend your line covering the intrenchments to Battery 24. For this purpose you may reduce the garrisons of Forts Wadsworth and Dushane to 300 men each. I would also like a small force of one or two companies kept in Fort Davison to keep the work in repair, and see that the abatis and other works are not destroyed.

Respectfully,
