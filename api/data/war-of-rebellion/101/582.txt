By command of Brigadier-General Sherman:

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, Ark., January 19, 1865-9 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Three steamers left here on the 12th instant for Fort Smith with supplies for that command for about sixty days. A force was sent to occupy Dardanelle and protect the passage of the boats. They passed Dardanelle safely on the 14th instant, and have since been heard from in safety at Mulberry Creek, about twenty-five miles this side of Fort Smith. It is believed they arrived at Fort Smith safely. Our force at Dardanelle under Major Jenks, First Iowa Cavalry, was attacked on the 14th after boats had passed up. Enemy was handsomely repulsed. Our loss, 1 killed, 15 wounded. Fifteen dead rebels were left on the field; also 15 wounded. Another regiment and section of battery sent from this place are at Dardanelle, Colonel Ryan, Third Arkansas Cavalry, in command. Colonel Ryan reports yesterday 9 p. m. that enemy is assembling to renew the attack on Dardanelle, and from floating pieces of charred [wood] he supposes that one of the boats had been destroyed in returning from Fort Smith. River has fallen too much to warrant sending more boats up at present.

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.

Nothing new up to this hour from Dardanelle, 12 noon.
