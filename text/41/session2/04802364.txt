THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE..
April 1,
ing but 8,765 ; within the now teeming domain
of Illinois a meager exhibit of 55,162 people;
and nowhere else throughout that imperial
Northwest which is the boast of America to-day
enough of human souls to be worth counting
in the census of 1820.
Do you not see the significance of these facts?
A million and a half of people already develop-
ing the resources of the one interior region,
commercially opened by the Mississippi, the
Ohio, and their tributaries, while barely three
'hundred thousand had yet entered into the
other to possess themselves of its waiting riches!
Accustomed as we are now to seeing the great
Northwest holding by lengths the lead in the
race of empire, with Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Arkansas lagging far in the
rear, this reversed picture of their relative ad-
vancement fifty years ago is startlingly sugges-
tive. It discloses to us how very great was the
effectofa wantof navigable connection between
the lakes and the ocean, to bring them into
play as a commercial organism, and it prepares
us for the prodigious results we shall see rapidly
following the formation of that coimectiou by
the opening of the Erie canal.
Ono backward glance more and 1 shall pro-
ceed to the description of those results.
The same year that the Erie canal was com-
pleted and opened as an avenue of transit be-
tween the lakes and the sea-board, a census
was taken in the State of New York. The

total population enumerated in the State was
1,614,458, more than forty per cent, of which
(655,583) was found within the limits of the
present counties bordering on the Hudson
river, while sixty-three per cent. (1,025,235)
occupied the comparatively small section of
the State lying east of Oneida lake and south
of Lake Clmmplain. So slowly did population
recede from the coast and the streams that
furnished avenues to the coast.
TUB LATER PICTOBE.
Now, to contrast with these illustrations of
the lingering and reluctant progress of west-
ward-creeping empire on the northern line in
1825, let us turn to those which follow in the
panorama of succeeding decades.
In 1830 thepopulationof Illinois had risen to
167,445, occupying 931,880 acres of improved
lands, and far outstripping that of Mississippi
its southern counterpart in position; Michigan
appeared in the list with 81,039 inhabitants ;
Ohio had grown to 937,903, with 4,605,000
acres of her lands improved and with half a
dozen lake port towns well started on her
northern shores; Indiana had advanced to a
population of 843,031, and 1,751,409 acres of
iier land were under cultivation. In 1840 the
report stood thus:

Indiana 1,350,428 8,161,717
The population of these seven States is now
not less that eleven millions, and in the whole
region commercially tributary to the lakes it
may be fairly estimated at fifteen.
In 1840 the cereal products of these States
amounted to 207,265,877 bushels. In 1850
they had increased to 434,802,061 bushels ; in
1800 to 079,031,550 bushels ; and in 1870 we
shall probably find them aggregating about a
thousand million bushels.
In 1830 the surplus breadstuffa exported
by the lake and th'e Erie canal were altogether
1,239,351 bushels, including flour estimated as
wheat. In 1860 the movement eastward by
every avenne—by canal, by railroad, and by
the St. Lawrence river, had attained the mag-
nitude of 78,652,486 bushels, and in 1862 its
enormous aggregate was 137,667,870. To show
the distribution on its several lines of the move-
ment in this last-mentioned year, 1862, when
it rose to its maximum and has not since been
quite equaled, I present to you the following
table in detail:

Total 8,433,037 95,502,685
Flour estimated as wheat 42,165,185
Total 137,087,870
More than half, as you perceive, of this
whole vast bulk of breadstuffs moved from the
West found its way to the Bast through the
entire length of the Erie canal from Buffalo,
and fully two thirds of it were borne into that
great channel at the two receiving points of
Buffalo and Oswego.
In 1886, when the first cargo of grain from
Lake Michigan came into the port of Buffalo,
there was received at that port an aggregate of
1,289,351 bushels. In 1868 the total receipts
at the same port, including flour estimated at
its equivalent in wheat, were 51,197,215, which
was a quantity lower by several million bushels
than the average of the past eight years; and
during the period of twenty-three}years, that
began with 1836 and ended with 1868, the West
had sent eastward through Buffalo alone the
prodigious amount of 808,712,614 bushels of
cereal products.
In the ten years that ended with 1845 the
grain receipts at Buffalo were 41,851,483 bush-
els; in the succeeding ten years they were
174,717,437 bushels; in the decade next fol-
lowing, which closed in 1865, they were 432;-
390,81& bushels; and in the three yearssince,
they have been 159,753,876 bushels^ which .
indicate for the current decade not less than
550,000,000 to 600,000,000 bushels.
For soven years past the tonnage of the traf-
fic of tho Erie canal has exceeded five mil-
lions annually, of which the through western
trade has constituted about eighty per cent.;
and in the twenty-one years since 1847, the ca-
nalaol' New York have'floated nearly 100,000,-
000 tons of commercial property upon their
waters.* You will observe, therefore, that the
western and northwestern States pay us an-
nually the large amount of nearly three million
dollars of tolls per ,annum, which is frittered
away by State legislation largely upon the lat-
eral canals. This amount, in the course of four
years, would fully pay the sum asked from the
General Government.
TJTE EIIIE CANAL A NATIONAL HIGHWAY.
It is in view of such results as these facts
exhibit, and which are directly traceable in
the largest measure, if not altogether, to its
construction, that I claim the Erie canal to
have been one of those works, tho undertak-
ing of which by a Government at public ex-
pense is dictated and justified by the strictest
principles that govern business enterprise,
because it is a work which has paid for itself
ten thousand fold in the wide creation of wealth,
and because every tax-payer in the nation has
shared in the profit it has returned. Suppose
that the Erie canal had been constructed, ac-
cording to the first design of its originators,
by the Government, and paid for out of the
Treasury of the United States, would it not
have been a richly remunerative investment of
the money of the people who contributed to it,
whether they lived in New York or Louisiana,
in Massachusetts or Ohio 1 That it was not so
constructed as a national work at the begin-
ning was due in part to accidental circum-
stances, but more, perhaps, to the prodigious
energy of tho statesmen in New York who con-
ceived what its effects would be, and who could
not endure to wait for Congress to acquire their
convictions. In ii report to the Secretary of
the Treasury, which was transmitted to this
House, Hon. Israel T. Hatch reviewed the
history of the early steps taken to bring about
the construction of the Erie canal in so con-
cise a manner that I cannot do better than
quote the accouut which he gives, to show what
a national character the enterprise had from
the first, and how desirous was the State of
Now York that it should be the work and prop-
erty of the nation at large. Mr. Hatch writes :
" Xn 1803, when discussions as to the Erie canal first
assumed the torm of definite action in the Legisla-
ture ot the State of New York, all minor aad selfish
interests wore patriotically regarded as subordinate
to tho national welfare.
/For most of the sommereial statistics which I have
cited I am indebted to E.H. Walker, esq., formorly
of Buffalo, now of New York, a statistician to whose
long and aecurate and most intelligent labors the
country owes the best data extant for a comprehen-
sive knowledge of the growth of its internal com-
raoreo.
