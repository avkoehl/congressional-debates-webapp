is in accordance with a recommendation of the
Secretary of War, and to enable the superintend-
ents of those establishments to adapt the machin-
ery at those places to work on the new model rifle
musket with the Maynard primer.. It is, no
doubt, well known to every gentleman here that
improvements of a remarkable nature have, within
the last few years, been made in infantry fire-
arms that must render obsolete, for all the pur-
poses of war, the ordinary musket. The recent
events in the Crimea have shown the vast import-
ance to be attached to that formidable instrument
of'war, the Mime rifle. This weapon has been
found, by experiment,to carry a thousand yards,
<and the bullet, at that distance, to have sufficient
force to penetrate into hard wood. Now, sir, 1
desire to say that experiments have been made at
Harper's Ferry, testing most satisfactorily that
the ordinary musket, when properly grooved, is
not inferior in range and accuracy of fire to the
celebrated gun to which 5 have referred, -i have
now before me the results of some careful experi-
ments made at Harper's Ferry, Carlisle barracks,
and the Washington arsenal, which have been
communicated to me by the head of the Ordnance
Bureau, and which I propose to append to these
remarks. These experiments are in the highest
degree honorable to the War and Ordnance De-
pal tments, which planned, and to the mechanics
of Harper's Ferry, who have carried their sugges-
tions into execution, Having made the explana-
tions which I intended, I will now withdraw my
•amendment.
Ordnance Office,
Washington, D. C., February 1-1, 18.55.
Sir : In compliance with a verbal request made by you
a few days since, I have the honor to scud yon a tabular
statement, showing the results of experiments made with
three kinds of projeehles, fired from our proent model
Harper'd Perry rifle, with diflorenf^numbtrs of grooves.
Also, a tabular statement, in pari, of experiments at the
Harper's Ferry armory, with same rifle.
Aiso, a biief statement ot a few trials with die American
musket, with a rifle barrel, and the present regulation
British rifle musket, of twenty-four round balls to the
pound. In these trials, however, the expanding elongated
bullets were used.
The above named trials were made under the direction
of officers of this department, and clearly exhibit the great
advantage in point of range and accuracy of fire from the
use of expanding projectiles in rifled barrels.
I a1?o indoso the copy of a report of an officer of the
sccorid regiment of infantry, of practice by the company
under his command, armed with the Harper's Ferry iifle,
prepared for long ranges. By the results, jou will perceive
the practice was decidedly satisfactory.
With much respect, your obedient,
A. K. CRAIG, Colonel Ordnance.
To Hon. C. J. Faulknfr, Chairman Committee Military
v?jfairs, House of Representatives,
Carlisle Carjucks, Pennsylvania, ?
January 22, 1855. £
Sir: In complrance with orders No. 67. dated head-
-<piarters, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, December J5,
1-854,1 have the honor to submit ihe follovvingrcportof the
firing made by Company f, Second United States Infantry,
-with the new pattern rifle for long ranges.
The height of the target fired at is seven feet and s-ix
inches; the width of the target is equal to the width of two
ttien standing in ranks. The body of the target is painted
white; the figure of a man, six feet high, life size; with
cap, seven inches bigh,is painted in black, in themiddloor*
the target. The target is made of oak plank, seasoned,
from two to two and a half inches in thickness.
Two hundred and seventy-two (272) shots were fired at
two hundred yards, using the two hundred yards sight, of
which about one hundred and foity-one (141) hit the target,
and forty-nine (49) the man. The missing balls geneially
went over the target. Firing at two hundred yards, fine
sight should be taken, and the aim should be as low as the
-middle of the thigh.
Two hundred and severity-eight (378) shots were fired at
three hundred yards, of which about ninety-three (93) hit
the target, and about thirty (3>)) the man. Noticed that in
firing this distance, with the three hundred yards sight,the
•balls invariably struck above the target, but that in firing
this distance with ihe two hundred yards sight, taking aim
at the breast, the balls generally strttck at the height aimed
Two hundred and forty-nine (249) «?hots were fired at
four hundred yards, of which forty-one (41) hit the target,
end about ten (l(h the man. Noticed that in firing this
distance with the four hundred yards sight, the balls inva-
riably struck above the target, but that in u&mg the three
hundred yards sight, or the three hundred and fifty yards
sight, the balls generally struck at the point aimed at.
One hundred and sixty-fight (16S) f-hots. at five hundred
yaids, were fired, of which about sixteen struck the target
and seven the man. Noticed that in firing this distance
with the five hundred jards .-sight, the balls invariably struck
above the taiget, but that, in using the four hundred and
fifty yards sight, the balls struck at the point aimed at.
Thirty (30) s-hots, at one hundred yards, were fired, of
which twenty-eight <28) struck the target and twenty four
the man. Noticed that in filing this distance with the two
hundred yatds sight, the aim should bo taken aslowasme
middle of the thigh, or at the knee, in oider to hit the man
between th<* shoulders and hips.
Eighteen (18) shots were fired at seven hundred (700)
yards, of which four (4) hit the target, and one the man.
Noticed that in firing this distance with the six hundred
and fifty yards sight, the bali would strike the object aimed
at.
Most of the firing at long ranges, (at four hundred and
five hundred yards,) during the week, vftxs in cold and
windy days, and without any previous knowledge of the
proper elevation to give the sight.
The balls at four hundred yards, and under, all went
through th«* plank. At five hundred yards they wenteithrr
through or nearly through the plank, and at seven hundred
yards they penetrated from an inch to an inch and a half.
All the firing, except that at seven hundred yards, which
was firing from a rest, was what is called off-hand firing.
Flora my use of the piece, and from my observation of
its use with the company, I have no hesitation in saying
that this rifle is most decidedly a more accurate and effect-
ive weapon than any that 1 have ever seen. *In filing at
long ranges the least unsteadiness, or error in sighting~the
piece, will cause the ball to strike at some distance from
the target. In such firing a rest should always be used, if
practicable. The weight of the ball, before firing, i  six
drachms and twenty-one grains, apothecary's weight. The
weight of the ball, after passing thiough the target, is six
drachms and eight and a half grains. Loss, twelve and a
hal f grains. I am, sir, very rebpectfully, vour obedient ser-
vant, L. M. KELLOGG,
Second Lieutenant Second Infantry, Commanding Com-
pany.
To Brevet Brigadier General E. A. Hitchcock, Colonel
Second Regirneiil Infanti y, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsyl-
vania.

Mr. CAMPBELL. What sort of a ball is it?
Mr. FAULKNER. It is a ball somewhat like
the ball used in France, but differing slightly in its
character.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Is it oblong?
RJr. FAULKNER. Yes, sir. I have before
me the results of experiments made at a distance
of three hundred, four hundred, and seven hun-
dred yards, which show that the ordinary musket
has been enabled to exceed in its accuracy and
ranee the celebrated Minie rifle. -Now, the object
of this appropriation is to have those experiments
applied to" all the muskets in the national armories.
I withdraw my amendment.
The third and fourth amendments of the Senate
were then concurred in.
Fifth amendment of the Senate:
Strike out the words " for repairs, preservation, and con-
tingencies of arsenals, $50,000," and insert  n lieu thereof
the following:
For arsenate, including the purchase of sites for new
arsenals in Texas and New Mexico, and the erection of
suitable magazines and other arsenal bnildings in Texas,
California, Oregon, and New Mcxico, $268,175.
Mr. PHELPS. I am instructed by the,Cora-
mittee of Ways and Means to move to Concur in
that amendment of the Senate, with an amend-
ment that will make it read as follows:
For repairs, preservation, and contingencies of arsenals,
$50,000 ; and for continuing the construction of the arsenal
at Bemcia, California, $40,000 ; and it is heieby provided
that the annual compensation of tiio civil bupcrmtendems
of the national armories be $2,500, without perquisites,
allowances, or additions of any kind, and that the same be
paid out of the appropriation tor the national armories.
The Committee of Ways and Means have in-"
structed me to recommend that that be adopted in
lieu of the Senate's amendment. Appropriations
for the construction of arsenals in Texas, New
Mexico, and Oregon, have already been made ia
bills which have passed this House.
Mr. LETCHER. Let the amendment pro-
posed by the Committee of Ways and Means i>e
read.
The Clerk read the amendment.
Mr. PHELPS. I desire to make a brief ex-
planation of this matter. The Senate amended the
bill by striking out the words " for repairs, preser-
vation, and contingencies of arsenals, $50,000,"
and inserted this provision:
" For arsenals, including the purchase of sites for new ar-
senals in Texas and New Mexico, and the erection of suita-
ble magazines, and other arsenal buildings, in Texas, Cali-
fornia, Oregon, and New Mexico, §288,175."
The Committee of Ways and Means propose
to retain the appropriation of $50,000 for contin-
gencies of arsenals, and to appropriate $40,000 for
the completion of the arsenal at Benicia. An esti-
mate for that was' submitted in the annual esti-
mates, and the committee believe that that ansenai
ought to be completed. There is no necessity of
concurring in that part of the Senate's amendment
which makes an appropriation for arsenals in
Texas, New Mexico, and Oregon, for we have
passed a bill appropriating money for the construc-
tion of arsenals in those places. The Committee
of Ways and Means propose to add to this
amendment'an amendment fixing the salaries of
the superintendents of the armories at Springfield
and Harper's Ferry. It will be recollected that,'
at the last session of Congress, we removed those
armories from under military superintendence, and
placed civilians in charge of them. At that time-
no salary was fixed, and no salary has yet been
fixed, by law. The committee, after considering
the matter, determined to fix the salary at $3,500*
with no contingencies or perquisites. The Secre-
tary of War recommended that the civil superin-
tendent should receive the pay and emoluments of
j a major of ordnance.
1 Mr. LETCHER. What was the salary under
the old law?
Mr. PHELPS. JThe superintendent was then
a military man, and his pay and emoluments
1 amounted to something like $2,800.
Mr. LETCHER. I mean under the former
civil supermtendency.
Mr. FAULKNER. He received $1,500.
Mr. LETCHER. Well, this seems a pretty-
large increase.
