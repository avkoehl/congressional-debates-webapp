Major-General ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I can occupy Clarksville by Bruce's force if you desire it, but Granger's force ought not to be taken from Bowling Green, as I can't replace it except by Bruce. This I will do if you wish it. We must keep a strong force on your line of communications, since a misfortune there, causing a week's interruption, would starve you.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Has Colonel Bruce occupied Clarksville? If not, he should do so at once, either with his main force or by a small one, with the rest within supporting distance. I incline to the former, so that he may have his full strength to resist an attack.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

If our force at Bowling Green and Munfordville fight, they can whip Morgan's force, and if he really comes (which I do not believe), all the
