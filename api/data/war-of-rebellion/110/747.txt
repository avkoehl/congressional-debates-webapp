General BRAGG:

Can I have General Gardner to place in command of Mississippi and East Louisiana? An intelligent and energetic officer is absolutely necessary there.

Lieutenant-General.

Have obeyed your orders and by General Hood's direction sent troops from Opelika to the front. General Taylor has published an order assigning me to command in Central Alabama. Will act as directed.

SEPTEMBER 26, 1864.

Captain SYKES:

SIR: By Captain Harvey's order, I am scouting on Sweetwater, the creek our limit. There are no Federals on the south side of the creek. One hundred and fifty came down to Fergusson's pickets on the 23d. We met them at the creek, and had not our courier missed his way, would have given General Ferguson ample time to have entrapped them. At captain's suggestion I inclose a map of the portion of the creek on which I am scouting. The two prominent fords on the creek, at Jones' plantation and Alexander's Mill, are one mile and two miles from the mouth of Sweetwater. The next ford is at Cooper's, which has been blockaded, but crossing very good; this is five miles from Alexander's Mill. The ford at Oldtown bridge is three mles from Cooper's, the two latter fords not used by the Federal opposite Gorman's Ferry, three miles from Sandtown, and one from the mouth of Sweetwater. We send a fine lot of bef-cattle.

Respectfully,

THOS. B. LOUD,

Commanding Detachment Harvey's Scouts.

HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE,September 27, 1864 - 6 p. m.

[General W. H. JACKSON:]

GENERAL: I have just learned that Gholson's brigade is stopping below Dog River and is not at Dark Corner, as you supposed. I have had posts of my brigade near Dark Corner, but relieved them this morning, thinking Gholson's brigade would reach there this morning early. The enemy's cavalry started down in direction of campbellton this evening, but retired as a force from Colonel Boyles' brigade was sent to meet them. I send you report from Lieutenant Loud.*

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
