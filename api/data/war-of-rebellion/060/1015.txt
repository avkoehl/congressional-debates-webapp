Captain FISHER;

Atmosphere this p. m. favorable for observation. Enemy appear to have devoted considerable labor in finishing their works in several places, either with sod or bushes. Do not observe any important changes from previous reports.

PAINE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 29, 1864- 11 a. m.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE:

I have had a detachment of cavalry at Morrisville and another at Grove Church, watching the lower fords of the Rappahannock. They will be withdrawn to- day, as they belong to Gregg, who is moving to Paoli Mills.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 29, 1864- 4 p. m.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Warrenton Junction:

It would be well to have some force at Morrisville, to keep the enemy's scouts and guerrillas from harassing you. It was for this purpose and to watch reported movements of Stuart's cavalry that I sent my cavalry. I will direct General Gregg, so long as he remains at Paoli Mills (near Kelly's Ford), to send scouting parties across the Rappahannock toward Falmouth.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major- General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 29, 1864.

Major- General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

The major- general commanding directs me to say that as General Burnside has no cavalry, General Gregg will not draw in the detachment now at Grove Church until he receives orders to move. General Burnside will send some infantry to Morrisville.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major- General, Chief of Staff.
