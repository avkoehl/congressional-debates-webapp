which they believe will result in  their being peí-   i
mitted to remain m the country    It all, said Mr    I
C. amounts to this  that they are kept m the coun-   i
try under the delusive expectation held out by John
Ross, that he can succeed in effecting such a negó-   |
tiation as will annul the treaty.    Again, said Mr,   j
C there is not sufficient force in that section of   i
country now to remove the Indians without blood-   I
shed, if these delusive expectations held out bj
Ross are permitted to continue, and although a
war would be most unfortunate to our people, jet
it would be a still greater scourge to the Cherokee;,
It would result in their exteimmation.    Then secu-
rity consisted in putting an end to the false hopes
that had been held out to them     Mr C   said he
would send the documents to the Chan,  that any
gentleman who wished it might have an opportu-
nity of inspecting them    He then moved to lay
the memorial on the table, but withdiew the motion
temporarily at the request of
Mr. SOUTHARD, who did not wish to entet into
any controversy on the subject the two Senators did
not feel more regret than he did on this matter The
motion he had just made, as well as the conveisa-
tioiia he had held with different individuals, would
show he had no desire to force it upon the conside-
ration of the Senate, with a view to a protracted dis-
cussion. These persons,claiming to be authonzed
agents, had put in his hands the memorial and pa- j
pers containing the eorrespondence between the Ex-
ecutive and these people He had felt it, theiefoit,
a solemn duty to present it to the Senate The In-
dians believe, whether justly or not, they had been
■wrongly dealt with, and ask Congress to heai them
Why not then, said Mr S refer the papers to the
Committee on Indian Affairs, which body ti ould,
no doubt, report promptly, and let them know w hat
they had to expect Such, in his opinion, would
be the true course for a great Government to pur-
sue towards a poor and oppressed race Give the
answer to their prayer m a constitutional manner,
and they will, no doubt, be satisfied If you refuse
them a hearing, said Mr S do you suppose that
would destroy their hopes of remaining'? No su1
no sir'—it will not If the papéis had been per-
mitted to have taken the course he proposed, he i
would not have opened his mouth on the suuject, |
but when it was sought to lay the documents on the
table, without a hearing, or any understanding in
the case, he would feel perfectly justified in going I
into this matter, and ascertaining whether these I
people had not been imposed upon He ftlt for I
them because he behevtd them an injured and a
wronged people, and that it uas an imperious djty
he owed to himselt, to them, and to the countrv, to
defend them with zeal It was because he was re-
luctant to go into this subject that h" proposed to n -
fer it to the committee he had named tí hich, in h s
opinion, was the wisest course that could be puisu-
ed That committee could make its rt port prompt-
ly, even in five lines, if it were necessaiy^so that
he might send it to them, and let them knou what
was the final resolve of Government m i elation to
them. If, however, it was the determination of the
Senate to lay this subject on the table, and refuse a '
hearing to these unfoi túnate people, he, foi one,
must be permitted to record his t ote against t
Mr GRUNDY made some remarks m íelation
to these papers, objecting to re"er them to the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, though he had as mucn
confidence m that committee as any other He
thought the Indians would as well understand the
motion to lay the memorial on the table to be defi-
nite, as though it were referred to the Committee on
Indian Affairs Mr. G renewed Ins motion to lay
it on the table, but withdrew it in order to give his
colleague [Mr White] an opportunity of present-
ing his views
Mr WHITE made some remarks, which were
not distinctly heard. He was undeistood, how-
ever, to maintain that all communications to the
Government fiom foreign nations, or from tribes
of Indians with whom treaties had been held,
should be made through the Executive biaiich oí
the Government
Ml CLAY of Alabama sa d he t as perfectly
satisfied, that if the subject i as referred t> the
Committee on Indian Affairs, it would not only be
well examined, but promptly acted on, and in a
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
way to pioduce as little excitement as possible.
His object « as to cut off at once the possibility of
misicprtsentation which might lead these deluded
people to a course most nníoitmiate lor themselves.
He noald not add anothei word, further than to
say that his object m making the motion, which he
now made, to lay the whole subject on the table,
was to put the subject down definitive!), and he
v, ishtd, also, that those is ho were friendly to the
objects of the memowal, would communicate
frankly to the memorialists that theie was not the
slightest hope oí duelling the Goternmtnl from its
intention to cany this tieaty into eflect.
