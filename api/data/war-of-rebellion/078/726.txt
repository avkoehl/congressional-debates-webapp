check the movement. The loyal element of the citizens becoming exasperated at what they fancied to be a huge speculation of Government agents, held meetings and threatened to burn every bale of cotton in the district. All this might have been quelled by the application of military force, but this I was averse to, and besides my orders (more especially from the President's inspector- general) were to use conciliation with the people, and then the very general belief among them that malfeasance in office existed to a remarkable degree among the agents appointed by Government for shipping and disposing of its cotton, was in some measure an excuse for their indignation assuming such a form. It is proper also to add that my own troops became infected with the fever against the contractors and Government agents, and disaffected about orders to permit the authorized agent to pass with large quantities, while those who really needed goods for family use were not allowed to carry in their pretty loads of one or two bales. Under the circumstances I determined to stop the whole thing until the matter could be investigated, and hope that my action will meet your approval. I have no wish to thwart unnecessarily the operations of Mr. Baskerville and the contractors, and just as soon as I have examined into the facts of the case, and find that they can conduct their transactions property, the present restrictions will be removed.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. S. SCOTT,

Colonel.

Major General D. H. MAURY:

GENERAL: In connection with the assignment of Brigadier-General Liddell to the command of the troops lately commanded by Brigadier General Wirt Adams, I will make the following statement for your information: General Adams' command consisted, until recently, of two brigades, commanded respectively by Colonels Scott and Mabry, and of one regiment and a battalion commanded by Colonel Wood. Colonel Mabry's brigade is properly General Adams' special command, Colonel Mabry, who belongs to Ross' (Texas) brigade, having been assigned temporarily to the command of it. About two months since Mabry's brigade was ordered to General Forrest's command and has since remained there, thus leaving General Adams in command of Scott's brigade and the regiment and battalion under Colonel Wood. By the special direction of the President Brigadier General St. John R. Liddell was ordered from the Trans-MISSISSIPPI Department to command Scott's brigade, and has within the last few days reported for duty. * As he ranks General Adams in date of commission he has been assigned to the command of all the troops lately commanded by General Adams, and specially to the command of Scott's brigade. General Adams is thus left without a suitable command and must therefore be ordered back to his old brigade, now commanded by Colonel Mabry. I would suggest that Colonel or of Neely's brigade, of Chalmers' DIVISION. If this, however, cannot be done without creating dissatisfaction in the commands referred to you will please order Colonel Mabry to report to me in the Army of Tennessee, where I will try to procure for him the command of a bri-
