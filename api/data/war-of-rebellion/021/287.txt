CATE'S SHOE FACTORY, 4 MILES NORTH OF PONCHATOULA,

March 24, 1863.

I have been engaged with the enemy in force, estimated at from 1,200 to 1,500 men, all day. I have 100 men. The force that attacked by railroad I defeated, but the gunboat leaned several hundred at Wadensborough in my rear, and I was compelled to retire. I fought the latter for some time near Ponchatoula, but when the two columns united I fell back 2 miles and made stand until sundown, when I drew off my command to this place.

The command behaved splendidly. My loss is small considering the time we were engaged. If you can re-enforce me I will retake Ponchatoula. It will require 500.

The enemy advanced on Ponchatoula with from 1,000 to 1,200 men strong, and I contended every inch of ground with them, but was necessarily compelled to fall back on account of being overpowered. Am now fighting them 2 or 3 miles this side of Ponchatoula and falling back because they are advancing in heavy force, and if you can send me re-enforcements as soon as possible I would be glad for you to do so, for I am very anxious to whip them back to Pass Manchac.
