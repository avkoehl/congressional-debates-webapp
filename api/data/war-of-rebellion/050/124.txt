prisoners from the rear of a retreating column. The general commanding is anxious to know what are the developments on the left. We hear artillery at Gordon's Mills and a few dropped shots in Negley's front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

ROSSVILLE, September 19, 1863-8.15 a.m.

General GARFIELD:

McCook took Reed's Bridge and burned it this morning. Whitaker was unable to reach Red House. Is now in position at McAfee's Spring. Whitaker reports the enemy moving on his front and left this morning. No other indications of the enemy. Have ordered McCook's and Mitchell's brigades to fall back from Reed's Bridge to this place. I have requested Wagner to keep the cavalry [out] and to keep me well advised.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

Major-General PALMER:

The rebels are reported in quite heavy force between you and Alexander's Mill. If you will advance on them in front while I attack them in flank, I think we can use them up.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near McDonald's House, September 19, 1863-9.30 a.m.

General ROSECRANS:

The enemy are reported this side of the Chickamauga, between Alexander's Bridge and Reed's Bridge. I am advancing in the direction of Reed's Bridge, holding a front in the direction of Alexander's Bridge. If General Crittenden will advance from Gordon's Mills on them at Alexander's Bridge we can, I think, use them up. I have two divisions ready to advance; the other will be up soon. Some prisoners taken by Colonel McCook last night say they belong to Hood's division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
