will get an answer to-morrow morning. I have little hope of a favorable answer, as the case will not be represented strong enough.

If the answer if unfavorable, shall I telegraph or go to Cairo, or return to Nashville? Will await an answer until 10 a.m. to-morrow.

S. A. STOCKDALE,

Captain,&amp;c.

NASHVILLE, November 10, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Captain Stockdale telegraphs from Smithland that he has had an interview with Captain Fitch, commanding gun-boat flotilla on the Cumberland, and that he will do nothing without orders from Admiral Porter. Fitch has telegraphed to Porter for instructions. Can anything further be done? I have directed Stockdale to proceed until he does get a convoy. Am I right?

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAINT LOUIS, November 10, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Am sending stores to Nashville as fast as possible to procure transportation. Water in the Mississippi very low; about 4 feet. Have turned over to quartermaster about 2,000,000 rations since November [October] 26.

T. J. HAINES.

LOUISVILLE, November 10, 1863.

Maj. Gen. U. S. GRANT:

Am obliged for the order forbidding interference with transportation. Will send immediately for a cargo of forage to Hamburg. Have shipped largely to Eastport.

ROBT. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General and Quartermaster.

LOUISVILLE, November 10, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Only interference with transportation to the Army of the Cumberland was an order given by adjutant during by absence for three batteries of artillery and their train to go by river, being loaded on boats, as the superintendent of railroads stated he could not send them for on week, and it was believed to be important to throw them forward. No orders were given for transportation, except for supplies for troops at Bowling Green, Munfordville, and Russellville. Have directed there is to be no interference by your order or General Thomas'.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
