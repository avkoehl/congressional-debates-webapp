I do not, in the first place, feel authorized to move them from their anchorage without the admiral's order, and this evening neither the weather nor tide will admit of their going. I have ordered a tug to proceed immediately to Stono and report to the commanding army officer as desired.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
