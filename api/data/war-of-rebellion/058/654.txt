General Ransom should be put in command of the active forces in Southwestern Virginia, and under my orders. The brigade of Buckner's division now at Dalton should be sent to the division at once. With this force I think that the move could be begun with safety and re-enforced as circumstances might require. At all events it seems as safe as doing nothing.

I remain, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
