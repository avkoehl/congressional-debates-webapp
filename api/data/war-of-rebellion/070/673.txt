CITY POINT, June 25, 1864-11.30 a.m.

(Received 2.20 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Richmond papers of yesterday state that Hunter at last accounts was at Fincastle. He will probably go to Beverly. There will be no use in Stahel attempting to reach him. All quiet here. Sheridan is now crossing the river where the army crossed. Yesterday evening Gregg's division had a very severe fight with the enemy between Charles City Court-House and Long Bridge. I do not know the result, but understand unofficially that we saved all the wagon train, which seemed to be the object of the attack. The loss was said to be heavy on both sides, the enemy coming in close canister range. The same Richmond paper announces that Wilson reached Burkeville. I shall try to give the army a few days' rest, which they now stand much in need of.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
