withdrawn last night at 9 p.m. and that cavalry replaced them. I have ordered my line of pickets to advance and attack the cavalry, and if the enemy are gone I'll be the first in at Corinth.

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, May 30, 1862-12.20 p.m.

General BUELL:

The rear guard of the enemy have halted and faced us about 3 1/2 miles from here. It seems to me that in their retreat they have run on their main body and are compelled to halt. Shall I attack them?

WM. NELSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Farmington, May 30, 1862-12.45 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

The advance of my cavalry detachment came upon the extreme rear guard of the enemy 8 miles from Corinth, on the Mobile and Ohio road, in the act of burning the bridge. They were at once dispersed, with loss of 40 prisoners. The fire was put out. The cavalry is pushing on.

JNO. POPE,Major-General, Commanding.

CAMP NEAR CORINTH, May 30, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

Reports from Corinth respecting enemy's movements are so conflicting, it is very difficult to fix definitely now our plans. Buell thinks a body of the enemy has moved west to attack our right flank. If we advance under these circumstances it will be best to move cautiously, leaving Buell to act either on the right or left, as circumstances may require. You will move south and east, feeling the enemy as you advance. Your provision trains should follow. The distance of your advance must be decided hereafter. Should you be attacked by Price and Van Dorn in force, Buell will act as a reserve. The entire programme may be changed to-morrow. I have ordered my horse, and will meet you at your headquarters. Carry forward the telegraph with you.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAMP NEAR CORINTH, May 30, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

The divisions of Generals Davies and T. W. Sherman will be immediately ordered to re-enforce you on the left. Push forward on the Danville road, and feel the enemy in that direction and farther south. Don't move your forces into Corinth; it is already occupied by us.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
