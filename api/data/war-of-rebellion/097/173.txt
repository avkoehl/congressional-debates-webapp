from the character of the fighting, the heaviest being repulsing their attacks, that their losses were very much greater. Wright also thinks they lost much heavier than we did. On Parke's front their losses were quiet severe from the artillery fire of adjacent batteries, not only when their supports were moving up but when they were withdrawing. On the which, I think it would be reasonable to estimate the enemy's loss in killed and wounded as 50 per cent. greater than ours. This would make them about 2,000, which, added to the prisoners, would give 4,800. Taking in stragglers and deserters I think it safe to estimate Lee's loss for the day not less than 5,000 men.
