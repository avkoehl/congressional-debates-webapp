Lewisburg and Clarksville. You will not send the scout to Searcy. The steamer Ella is in and brings reports that Marmaduke and Cabell are captured, with 2,000 men and 10 pieces of artillery and 400 wagons. The general suggests that you go by way of Springfield, covering your right flank well with scouting parties.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER,Fort Smith, Ark., November 3, 1864-4 p.m.

Colonel S. H. WATTLES,

Commanding Indian Brigade:

SIR: The two messengers who left Gibson with dispatches for this place at 8 a.m. November 2 were attacked on a small prairie ten miles from here and one of them captured. The other has just arrived. It seems that each had dispatches. The one that arrived here brought nothing for these headquarters, accordingly any important dispatches which may have been sent by you are lost. If there was anything of importance please duplicate and forward immediately. If there were any dispatches from Fort Scott, and you know the contents, communicate the same at once. Hereafter in sending dispatches give a copy to each messenger, so that if a part are captured information will yet be received.

Respectfully, yours, &c.,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
