senate.
in concert with the Opposition, had ceased, Execu-
tive usurpations had come to an end for the. pre-
sent, and that the struggle with the Administration
was no longer for power, but to save themselves I
also clearly saw ii we should unite with the Oppo-
sition in their attack on the Administration, the vic-
tory over them in the position they occupied would
be a victory over us and our principles. It required
no sagacity to see that such would be the result It
was a  plain as day The Administration had
taken position, as I have shown, on the vei y giound
I occupied m 1834, and winch the whole State
Rights party had taken at the same time in the
other House, as its journals will prove The Op-
position, under the bannerol the bank,were moving
against them for the very reason that they had taken
the ground they did.
Now, I ask, what would have been the result if
we had joined in the attack? No one can now
doubt that the victory ovei tho¡>e in power would
have been ceitain and decisive, nor would the con-
sequences have been the least doubtful. The first
Jruit would have been a National Bank. The
principles of the Opposition, and the very object ol
the attack, would have necessarily led to that. We
would have been not only too ieeble to íesist, but
would have been committed by joining in the at-
tack with its dvowed object to go tot ont, while
tho-e who suppoit the Administration would have
been scatlcied in the winds We should then have
had a bank—that is cleai, nor is it less certain,
that in its tram there would have followed all the
consistences ^hich have and ever will follow,
whenmed—high duties, overflowing revenue, ex-
uavagant expenditures, large surpluses, in a word,
all those disastious consequences winch have well
neai overthrown our institutions, and involved the
country in its preseat difficulties. The influence
ol the institution, the known principles and polity
ol the Opposition, and the utter prostration of the
Adro id istrahwn party, and the absoipuon of ours,
w otild have led to these result;, as certainly as we
exist
I now appeal, Senatois, to your candor and jus-
tice, and ask, could I, having all these conse-
quences before mi, withmy known opinions and
that of the part> to which I belong, and to whieh
only I owe fidelity, have acted dillcrcntly from
what I dull Would nut any other course ha\e
justly exposed me to tnechdr¿eoí having abandon-
ed my principles and paitj, with which I am now
accused so unjustlyl Nay, would it not have been
worse than folly— been madness in me, to have
taken any «tl (r' And yet, the grounds which 1
1 up assumed in this exposition are the very rea-
sons assigned in my letter, and which the Senator
has perveited most unfair!} and unjustly into the
pmlul, personal, and selfish reason, which he ha>¡
attributed to mt Confirmative of what I say, I
again appeal to the retord The Secretary «ill
lead the paragraph marked in my Edgef eld letter,
to which, I presume, the Senator alluded

I now ask, is there any thing in this extract which
will warrant the construction that the Senator has
attempted to fefce on it?   Is it not manifest that
the expression on which he fixes, that the victory
would enure, not to us, but exclusively to the bene-
fit ol the Opposition, alludes not to power 01 place,
but to principle and policy1! Can words be rnoie
plain' What then becomes of all the aspersions
of the Senatoi, his rellections about selfishness and
the want ol patriotism, and his allusions and illus-
trations to give them íbice and effect? They ¡all to
the ground without deserving a notice, with his
groundless accusation.
But, 111 so piemeditated and indiscummate an at-
tack, it could not be expected that my motives
would entirely escape, and we accordingly find the
Senator very charitably leaviug itto time to disclose
rsy motive lor going over. Leave it to tune to dis-
close my motive lor going ov<r' I, who have
changed no opinion, abandoned no pi mciple, and
deserted no party, I, who have stood still, and main-
tained my ground against tueiy difliculty, to be told
that it is hit to time to disclose my motive1 The
imputation sinks, to the eaith with the gimundlcst,
charge on which it rests I stamp it with scorn m
the citw I pick up the darl, which fall harmless
at my tcet I hurl it back What the Senator
ehaiges on me unjustly, /« has actually done. He
went over on a memorable occisión, and did not
leave it to tune to disclose his motive.
The Senator next tells us that I bore a character
foi stem fidelity, which lie accompanied with re-
marks implying that I hadiorleited it by my couise
on the prtsent occasion H he means by stein
fidelity a devoted attachment to duty and principle,
which nothing can overcome, the character is, m-
dt Oil, a hnrh out, and, I trust, not entuely nnmeii-
ted I have, at least, the authonty oi the Senator
himsell for saying that it belonged to me befoie the
piesent occasion, And it is, ot course, incumbent on
him t« «ihow that I have smc e forfeited it He Will
find the ta-k a Herculean one It would be by far
more easy to «how the opposite, that, instead ot for-
feiting, 1 have strengthened my title loth? character,
¡niteael of ahindoninjr, any pimctples, I havcfnmly
adheie 1 to tin m, and that, too, nmier the most appal-
lirif difficulties If I were toseleet an instance in the
whole unirse ol inv hie on which, above all othcis,
to íest inv claim to the character which the ¡Senator
attributed to me, 11 would be this very one, which
he has selected to ptove that 1 have forfeited
it I acted with the full knowledge of the diffi-
culties 1 hid to encounter, and the responsibility I
must incur I siw a great and powerful party,
probably the mo'-t poueilul 111 the tommy, eagerly
selling on the catastrophe which bad bclallen the
lurrencv, and tin conse que ut embarrassments that
followed, to displace those inpowei, against whom
they hail been long contending I saw that, to
stand btluoen them and thou object, I must neces-
sarily m<ur the 11 deep ind lasting displeasure I
al 0 saw thit, 10 maintain the Administration in
the position they hid taken, to separate the Go-
vernment from the banks, I would draw doun on
me, with ih" exception 01 some ot the Southern
banks, the whole wi ight of [that extensive, concen-
trated and powerlul interest—-the most powerful
bv farol any in the whole community, and thus I
would urine against me a. combination of political
and inonejed influence almost irresistible N01
was this all I could not but see that, however
pure and disinterested rny motives, and howevei
consistent my course with all I had ever said or
done, 1 would be exposed to the very ehaiges and
aspei sums which I am now repelling The ease
with which thev could be made, and the temptation
io make them, / sdw were too great to be resisted
by the parly morality of the day, as groundless as I
have demonstrated them But there was another
conaeoucncc that I could not but foresee, far more
pamiut to me than all others I but too clearly
saw that, in so sudden and complex a juncture,
called on as I was to decide on my course in-
stantly, as it werp, on the field of battle, without con-
sultation, or explaining my reasons, I would
estrange for a time many of my political friends,
who had passed through with me so many trials
and difficulties, and for whom I feel a biother's
love. But I saw before me the path of duty, and,
though rugged, and hedged on all sides with these
and many othei difficulties, I did not hesitate a
moment to take it.   After I had made up my mind
as to my course, m a conversation with a fnend
about the responsibility I would assume, he re,
marked that my own State might defert me. I re-
plied that it was not impossible, but the result has
proved that I under-estimated the intelligence and
patriotism of my virtuous and noble Stale,. I ask
her pardon for the distrust implied in my answer;
but I ask with assurance it will b« granted, on the
grounds I shall put it—that m being prepared to
sacrifice her confidence, as dear to me as light and
lite, rather than disobey, on this great question, the
dictates of my judgment and conscience, I proved
myself worthy ol being her representative
But, if the Senator, m attributing to me stern
fidelity, meant, not devotion to principle, but to
party, and especially the party of which he is so
prominent a member, my answer is, that I never
belonged te*bis party, nor owed it any fidelity, and,
oí course, could forfeit, in reference to it, no cha-
lacter for fidelity It is true, we acted in concert
against what we believe to be the usurpations of
the Executive, and it is true, that, during the time,
I saw much to esteem m those with whom I acted,
and contracted friendly relations with many which
I shall not be the first to forget. It is also true
that a common paity designation was applied to
the Opposition in the aggregate, not, however, with
my approbation, but it is no less true that it was
univeisally known that it consisted of two distinct
parties, dissimilar in pi mciple and policy, except
111 relation to the object for which they had united-
the National Republican party, and the portion of
the Stale Rights party which had separated from
the Administration, on the ground that it had de-
parted from the tiue principles of the original par-
ty That I belonged exclusively to that detached
portion, andtoneithei the Opposition nor Adminis-
tration party, I prove by my explicit declaration,
contained in one of the extracts lead from my
¡.peech on the currency in 1834 That the party
generally, and the State which I represent in part,
stood aloof from both of the parties, may be esta-
blished fiom the fact that they refused to mingle in
the party and political contests ot the day. My
Stile withheld het electoral vote in two successive
Piesidential elections, and, íatherthan to bestow it
on either the Senator from Kentucky, or the dis-
tinguished cm/en whom he opposed, in the first of
those elections, she threw her vote on a patriotic
citizen of Virginia, since deceased, of her own
politics, but who was not a candidate, and, in the
last, she refused to give it to the worthy Senator
from Tennessee near me, [Judge Whits,,] though
his principles and views ot policy approached so
rnuc h nearer to hers than that of the party to which
the Senatoi from Kentucky belongs But, suppose
the fact ws otherwise, and that the two parties
had blended so as to form one, and that I owed to
the united party as much fidelity as I do to that
to whi«h I exclusively belonged, even on lhat sup-
position, no conception of patty fidelity could have
controlled my course on the present occasion. I
am not among those who pay no regard to party
obligations, on the contnry, I place fidelity to par-
ty among the political % irtues, but I assign to it a
limited sphere I confine it to matters ot detail
and airangement, and to minor questions of policy.
Beyond that, on all questions involving principles,
01 measures calculated to affect materially the per-
manent interest of the country, I look only to God
and country
And here, Mr President, I avail myself of the
opportunity to declare my present political position,
so that there may be no mistake hereifter. I be-
long to the old Republican State Rights paiíy oí '98.
To that, and that alone, I owe fidelity, and by that
I shall stand through every change, and in spite of
every difficulty Its creed is to be found in the
Kentucky resolutions, and Virginia resolutions and
report, and its policy is to confine the action oí this
Government within the narrowest limits compatible
with the peace and security of these States, and the
objects for which the Union was expressly formed.
I, as one of that party, shall support all who sup-
port its principles and policy, and oppose all who
oppose them I have given, and shall continue to
give, the Administration a hearty and sincere sup-
poi t on the great question now under discussion,
because I regard it as in strict conformity to out
