Captain A. V. BARRINGER,

Parkersburg, W. Va.:

I think all is now right below. We are in possession of Point Pleasant again. Let me, know when----with the baggage-fleet is ready to start, and I will then determine whether I shall need them at Point Pleasant.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, March 31, 1863.

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Commanding Department of Washington:

GENERAL: I herewith send a tabular statement of armament, garrisons, &amp;c., of the forts constituting the Defenses of Washington. Also a statement of the length of lines of rifle-pits.* Also a statement giving a list of batteries for field guns, indicating their location and the number of guns they will receive.* Drawings will be made and sent to you, which will indicate the position of these rifle-pits and batteries, as also of all the forts.

It will be seen that the total of full garrisons for all the forts is 26,725 men, of which 10,305 consists of artillerymen and 16,420 of infantry.

These garrisons are apportioned as follows:

Location.	Artillery.	Infantry.	Total.

Fort Lyon position	 390	 1,260	 2,150

From Fort Ellisworth to	 3,315	 4,730	 8,045

Fort Concoran

Chain Bridge position	 600	 1,000	 1,600

Potomac to Easterm Branch	 3,500	 5,700	 9,200

Over Eastern Branch	 2,000	 3,730	 5,730

Total	 10,305	 16,420	 26,725

It is a matter of some difficulty to say with any precision what additional troops are necessary to hold Washington, as it would depend much upon the circumstances and force of the attack, and also upon the condition of the Potomac.

It may be stated, in the first place, that besides the full garrisons at the Chain Bridge, there should be, when the enemy is, or can be, near enough and strong enough to attack in any force, an additional infantry force there (with some cavalry) of about 2,000 men, making, say, 3,600 in all. With this force, the rifle-pits can be sufficiently manned to resist a strong attack. Should an attack be protracted, or should an enemy appear before the position in force, about 4,000 more men, and at least three field batteries, would be required for a protracted resistance.

The rifle-pits of the position are 3,500 yards (say 2 miles) long, but here, as elsewhere, it will be never necessary to man the whole length. A considerable portion of those between Fort Ethan Allen and the Potomac, for example (behind the ravine), would be sufficiently guarded by two companies, as it is almost unassailable, and needs only to be carefully watched.

At Fort Lyon and outworks there should be permanently, I think, a force equal to the full garrisons (2,150 men), and, if the enemy's movements or positions are such that he can throw himself in force upon this
