Numbers 4. Report of Captain George H. Walter, Washington (South Carolina) Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS,Jacksonborough, July 12, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that on Friday last (10th instant), two gunboats of the enemy passed up the Edisto River, and rapidly advanced to a point opposite the plantation of Dr. Glover, about 3 miles below the railroad bridge. At this place I had placed in position two pieces of the Washington Artillery, Lieutenant Horsey commanding, who opened fire with great steadiness and precision, and, after a sharp action of about an hour, succeeded in driving back both boats, one of which was seriously injured and evidently in a sinking condition. Lieutenant [John] Banskett, with Company B, Sixth South Carolina Cavalry, were deployed as skirmishers, and, although not engaged, were of material assistance in giving information and acting as scouts.

I have no casualties to report, excepting the loss of a battery horse from the effects of the intense heat.

Yours, respectfully,

GEO. H. WALTER,

Captain, Commanding Post.

Captain P. K. MOLONY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
