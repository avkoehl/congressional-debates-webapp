_ After the close of the war, by the suppres-
sion of the rebellion by force of arms, the rail-
roads so seized and used were restored to the
original railroad companies respectively at the
respective dates just named. They were no
longer regarded, or at least treated, by the
Administration at Washington as property be-
longing to the Government, and, being restored
to the original companies, their relation to the
Government became changed. Tho Govern-
ment fetters were relaxed, and, like slaves
coining up from chattels int® life with souls
breathed into them, they became parties to
contracts. They became purchasers of certain
property, principally of what is familiarly called
''rolling stock," from the Government, which
had been during the war purchased by the Gov-
ernment from northern railroads and manu-
facturers. Not being able, or, at least, after the
necessary ravages of war, presumed not to be
%ble, to pay ready cash for said property, they
became debtors to the Government and gave
bonds, each for the amount of its respective
purchase. Prom the relation of captured prop-
erty belonging to the Government they thus
occupied the relation of debtors to the Gov-
ernment with its military grasp relaxed. Such
is the relation they now, with some few excep-
tions, sustain'.
BAD FAITH.
These debtors have generally (with a few hon-
orable exceptions, which the committee will
with pleasure mention) failed "to meet their
obligations promptly. Some have unbecom-
ingly broken faith with the Government, have
falsified their promises, and have presumed to
bring forward as offsets, or rather as over-
shadowing claims, accounts against the Gov-
ernment for the use of the roads by the Gov-
ernment after their capture during the rebellion.
"With life restored for the time being by the
Government which they, as mighty and "effi-
cient instruments of war," had been attempt-
ing to destroy, they again seek its vitals by
attempting to absorb its material lifeblood, its
financial substance. Callous to all feelings of
gratitude, they assert claims against the Gov-
ernment for the use of the roads, which very
use had become necessary in order to suppress
the very rebellion against that Government
which they themselves had been, so far as testi-
mony will show, the willing instruments in sus-
taining. .' The red-handed criminal, or,. using
the mildest language the committee can think
at all proper, the particeps criminis, claims
compensation for losses incurred in conse-
quence of his own crime.
These facts will necessarily lead the commit-
tee to further statements and remarks on this
point before they shall have closed this report.
They have now merely stated "the past and
present relations" of these captured railroads
m general terms.
MONET EXPENDED.
The next branch of the subject presented to
the committee is—
"The amount of money expended by tho United
States in constructing, repairing, equipping, and
managing said roads."
This information the committee have ob-
tained, so far as possible, and present in the
testimony. They would have been pleased to
have procured information to enable them to
report the amount of money expended on each
of said roads, but, as will be seen on page 307
of Report No. 34, "the reports of the military
railroad department give the totals of expend-
itures and of receipts for each department or
military division, but fail to show the precise
amount expended upon or received from each
road," arising "partly from imperfections in
the reports and partly from the fact that much
of the expense was in common to all the rail-
roads or those of one department." Major
General George H. Thomas, (see page 307 of
Report No. 34,) under executive order of 8th
August, 1865, "caused tabular statements of
expenditures and^eeeipts to be prepared of
each road in the military division of the Ten-
nessee;" but it will be observed that "they
were made up in a great measure from esti-
mates, not from actual figures; and these
statements are carried back only to August 1,
1863, while some of the railroads included in
them were used at an earlier period." "As to
the railroads other than in military division of
the Tennessee, there was at Quartermaster
General's office no ascertained record of the
expenditures and receipts of each railroad prior
to the inquiry of this committee."
"The report of Colonel Crilly supplies the
information as far as ascertained; but the rec-
ords of the military railroad department cover
but a portion of the period during which these
railroads were held by Government."
'1 The military commanders who first seized
and held them have furnished but imperfectly,
if at all, either through direct reports or those
of their quartermasters, the data for ascertain-
ing the expenditures and receipts upon each
railroad."
And your committee can very readily under-
stand why commanders did not require these
accounts to be kept separate and distinct for
each road; because it did not enter into their
minds to conceive that it could ever be con-
templated by a Government to pay enemies
for the use of captured property that had been
used against that Government.
But as the committee are only instructed to
give "the amount of money expended by the
United States authorities in constructing, re-
pairing, equipping, and managing said roads,"
they state the aggregate amount, so far as esti-
mates have been made in the quartermaster's
department. As per statement No. 5 on page
326 of Report No. 34, the aggregate "cost of
constructing and operating United States mili-
tary railroads duringtherebellion," being "the
amounts expended for labor and materials," is
§45,367,480 '27.
In the estimates of expenditures for "labor"
it should be borne in mind that the evidence
discloses the fact that the pay of soldiers
who performed "labor" on roads is not in-
cluded.
MONEY OWIXCJ BY EACH KAILKOAD.
This brings the committee to the next branch
of the subject as presented, to wit, "the amount
of money each of said railroad companies is
owing to the Government."
To impart the fullest information the Com-
mittee here copy tabular statement from pages
327 and 328 of Report No. 34.
