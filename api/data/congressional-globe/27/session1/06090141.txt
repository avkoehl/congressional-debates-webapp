Novy Appropriation Bill—Mr. Ward.
H. of Reps.
present Administration, there was, said Mr W
nc endenté of it in the proceedings tf this House
up in pny questions involving the true interests of
the country The gentleman certainly will not
consider an oppos.üon to the gag law as factious,
nor could any one even trpat, as factious an oppo-
sition to measures, which invoked the ongiaal
principle of difference between tne Federal and
Democratic par íes—such as a funded debt, a Na-
tional Banb,&c But when mea ures ?ffecting the
safety and honor of the country were concerned—
measures for national defence—the Democratic
party would not be found in opposition, no matter
which Administration misht be in power For
himself, represent ne, as he did in part, a great
commercial State, whose extensive frontier, both
on ths lakes and the o„-an, was much exposed to
the inroads and insults of an enemy, he would not,
especia'ly at such a crisis as this, oppose any pro-
position for puti rig the country in a condition tor
defending ltsei'. Hethanked the honorable chairman
of the Committee of Naval Affairs [Mr Wise] foi
bringing forward this bi , and he legretted that it
had not been n roduced oefce, and made the first
measure of the session, before we hid parted with
ojrnati< nal domain, and while it was yet in our
power to make a more ample provision for the
common defence
The peop'e throughout the country are anxif usly
looking for appropriations for naíicnal de ence
There never was a lime when they v ere mor1 ne-
cessary, tor tht re never was a time when the coun-
try wasm a more defenceless state and condition
We have, it is true, avast many fortifications, but
some are only naif completed, and all are without
adequate Brm">ments The greater part of our
ships are in ordinary, or on the st< oks wnhout the
means of fittng c ut the one or finishing the o her
There is noi a put m th  United Stile , it is to be
apprehend d, tiat could not be placd under co -
tnbutioa, bv two s>mps of the line, or uo of the
largest class of steam vessels
On the other hand, we aie at issue on a point of
national interest, and what is of far more conse-
quence, of national honrr, with one of the rr ost
warlike and powerful nations in the world—a na-
tion ready to strike at a moment's warning, and ac-
customed to give the first blow—a nation, if we
may be permi ted to judge from the um /er«al lan-
guage of its population, and mini ter al organs,
are uni'ed «simo t to man in hostile feelings toward
the Um eJ State , white, at the tame time, there
was no good feelings towards uson the pait of our
Canadian neighbors.
Yet gentlemen s°em to think we sha!) have no
v ar, whi e every day encouraging it bv ne^'ectmg
all íauonal means for preservm  peace in t! e only
way becoru tig this great Contederacy, by tne as
se* ion and maintenance of its rights and its honor
But bull they say we shall have no wai, England
kiowsrerHf in tht. wroDg, and will, theiepore,
not provoke and sustain, much less corrmenc , a
war in supno-t of her wrong Thecode < f national
morals n, forsoi <h, 'o strict, both in theory and
piactice, that tl ere is ro sort rf danger that Eng-
land will mamta n a fa s.e posi'ion by a resort to
arms.
But look in the book of expe-i nce, the htstorv
of nations, and >ou w 11 find, if ray memory does
not deceive me, that nine times out of t n tht na
Hon most w the wro-g, is the first to resort to
arms.
It is the strongest na ions that most frequently
commit injuries or infl ct injustice, and this yery
co-sciousness of strength is the greatest obstac.e to
fabearance
i a*, sir, wh n was it, in what age of pure mo-
rality, or magnanimous, moderation, lhat a nation
ever refraired from exareising its pjwer in defend-
in" a wrong? I trust, nr, the United States v. ih
no" go to sleep and dream we «halt have no war,
because England is prepaied and we are not—be-
cau e we are right and she is wrong—because al-
though we have been disputing a long while, we
have not come to blows The first blow always
comes unexpectedly, war, pestilence, famine
earthquakes, and ail the great calamities which
involve nations and communities in suffering and
rum, come like a thief in the night, when no one
expicts and no one i  prepared for them
Independent of any ímmertiite danger of col-
lision with Great Britain, in consequence oí the
position of the McLeod affair, or of any of the
numerous points of difference existing between us
and that Government, there were other consi-
derations which rendered it necessary to give
greater strength and efficiency to the navy Upon
our naval force, we must rely for the protection
not only of a foreign commerce which covers
every «ea, but of aseacopst three thousand mil-s in
extent and of the ímmen e internal trade if the
c untry, which seeks a channel to market in the
ports of the Atlantic, ard of the Gulf of Mexjco
The situation of our Southern States in relation
to th  West Indies, and the security of their slave
populati n from en erpnses which, at one day,
may be set on foot in these islands, furnishes a
strong reason for an inerea e rf our naval force
Thus every portion of the Unit n is equally inte
rested in the maintenance of an efficient navy
It could be shown thit our navy was not
at al! commensurate wuh the great extent of our
foreign comme-ce and nivieation With a de-
sign to illustra e this view of the subjpct, as well
as to comply with the vr-hes of the honorable gen-
tem?n fromNoilh Carolina [Mr McKay] who
had asked some information in regard to the ex-
tent of out naval force, Mr W would now
offer some s atemen^, showing the value
of the commerce, the amount of tonnage,
and the naval fere of England, France,
and the United Sia'es, for v.h ch he was n debed
to an article prepared by an intell gent and able
gentleman, a citiyen of New Yoik

even in these years of depression, is  sill worth

clusive of officers     France hts an available force
of   forty nine   line   of   batde  ships,    fifty-seven
frigates, twenty five corvettes of  the first class,
and two hundred and six vessels of inferior fores,
among which are thirty-six sleameis. Of this fleet,
eight ships of the line are in actual commission
? broad, nine equipped ready for immediate service
on the completion of their crews- also twelve
frigates, thirty-mne sloops, seventeen brigs, thirty-
six smaller vessels, tweniy-«even transports which
are armed, and occasionally act as cruisers and
twenty-one steamers These ships in commission
are manned by a force of twenty-four housand
men exclusive of officers
The last Navy Register shows the naval force of
the United States to cens'st of eleven ships of the
line, sixteen frigates, twen y onestoops, four brigs,
nine «hooners, four steamers and a store ship.
Some of these chips are unseaworthy, and many
others require extensive repa>r< Of this force
there are only the ft 1 owing in actual commission-
four ship" of tne line—three of these being receiving
ships, whichneverquit their moorina0—five frigates,
thirteen sloop , thiec bn?s eight schooners, two
steamers and the s ore ship, manned with a force
id alt of nine thou and one hundred and twenty 
five men
The ratio between our relative preparation for
maritime definía and the value of our commerce,
the amount cf our tonnage, and the number of our
seamen, falls mfi n'ely short of bo h England and
France, and, as it is our policy to remam at peace,
as far as practicable, witn all nations, we snail ne-
ver rf quire a naval fore of tie va«t ex eat which
the=e more warhks nations find it necessary* to
maintain A forie that will be efficient pgamst any
whi h n ey could, it one time bring nlo employ-
ment against us, vould not be very large, in pro-
portion to the exfnt of th^ir ¡miliary rr arme. But
ih" disproportion v, hich our navy b avs to that of
cth r povcrs, char'J si ows tnat it i -nholly inade-
quate to make head aga list their pov erful naval
fore s.
The friends of t-^e present Admin stration, Mr
W said, had repeatedly, both m and out of Cor-
gress, crarged the Democratic party with a de-
sire to provrke a war with Great Britain. But
he wholly disclaimed any such wr h on his own
part, and he was sure the Democratic party had
ro wish to involve the country in war, unless as
an alternative t3 national dishonor. 1 he policy of
thii Government is essennallv p aeeful, we have
no desire for conquest, nor do we vusn to add to
the exiert of our territory He woul 1 remind gen-
tltmen that tne application of Texas for admission
into the Coni deiaey received no coanteranre here,
and he religiously believed thit, if the Cauadas
were now independent of Great Butain, and
should apply for admission into the Union, the
proposition would be rejected
It was certain that Great Britain had placed the
Cañadas m a sta e of complele-deience, and given
them ample means of offence a'so. There was
now m the Cinadas and under arms a military
frrce of bet wen twenty and thirty thousand of the
best appointed troops. It a'so appears from the
able report from the Commit ee on Na< at Affairs,
made by the gentleman from Gen gi?, [Mr. Tiros.
BoTrERKiNo] that there are, a this time, tea
thousand black troops m the British West Indies,
and that oiders have recently been issued to in-
crease their numbpr to twenty five thousand, that
the«e trooos are disciplined, and commanded by
white officers, and are no doubt designed to form a
most important portion of the fore- to be employed
in any contest that may arise between Great Britain
and tne United Sta e* He farther remarks, in his
report, that, "oy reference to the man of the West
India mail lines, it will be seen that, in our present
defenceless condition, a force composed of armed
steamers and troops of that description would not
only gn e great annoyance to our coast, but most
effectually and at once put a stop to ali communi-
cation around Cape Florida, or through the passes
of the Vest Indies <o or irons he Guli of Mexico,
and, cons qHenlly, the commerce ot the great val-
ley of the Mi si«sippi must fall into the hands of
the enemy, or its vast productions, cut off from
market, be rendered valueless "
Such being the present attitude of the two na-
tions, Mr W said it &eemed h tie less than folly
to delay preparation for deface.   It seemad t$
