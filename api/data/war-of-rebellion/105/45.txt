Recapitulation: I left Camp Wright on the 1st day of December, 1861, at 11 p. m. ; arrived at Temecula December 2, at 5 a. m. -delayed for four hours in a fruitless search for two men that had been encamped near that place; started at 2 a. m. same day for San Luis Mission, on the san Diego road; arrived at Tibbett's ranch, near the Mission, at or about sundown same day; left San Luis for Camp Wright at 2 a. m. on the 3rd of December; came by the way of San Luis Rey Mission to Temecula. Arrived at Temecula at 2. 45; fed the horses and proceeded to Camp Wright, arriving there at 9. 45. The road is very good most of the way. Distance traveled from Oak Grove to Temecula, 25 miles; from Temecula to San Luis Mission, by the San Diegoroad, 26 miles; from San Luis to Temecula, by San Luis Rey, 35 miles, making the distance traveled 111 miles.
