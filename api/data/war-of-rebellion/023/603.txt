PERRYVILLE, VIA BARDSTOWN, October 9, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

The enemy retreated by Springfield on our approach to Bardstown. We pressed him form Springfield to Perryville, where he was compelled to make a stand. A partial but severe action took place yesterday, lasting till night. The enemy retired during the night toward Harrodsburg. Their sick have been removed from Danville to Dick Robinson or near there, and they are said to have established provision depot at that place. The Twelfth Division, under Dumont, is at Frankfort. If you are advancing should move northward by the Frankfort pike, a thing not probable, his progress on that route should be impeded as much as possible without endangering the force under Dumont.

Your, very truly,

BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 10, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL,

Commanding Army of the Ohio, Bardstown, Ky.:

Yours of the 9th from Perryville received. The force here is moving, advance being near Crittenden. It numbers only about 10,000;; all new troops; not a single old regiment or battery. I have besides these five regiments just arrived and not yet entirely equipped for the field. Major-General Granger, in command, has been ordered to move rapidly as possible to co-operate with your forces, but character of troops is such he must exercise great caution in his movements. He will incline toward Frankfort to sustain Dumont, and it is hoped he may be in time.

Very truly, yours,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 10, 1862.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Unless your need of troops at Louisville is very pressing no more can be sent there at present. They are wanted here. I have only three batteries, and they are to the front. Our force is small; all new troops; but it is being pushed forward as rapidly as possible. Have received dispatch from General Buell about co-operation, which I have just answered. He says nothing in regard to his losses. Enemy retired toward Harrodsburg.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
