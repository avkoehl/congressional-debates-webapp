other purpose or in any other manner whatso-
ever." Just before the banking privileges
ceased, its effects were transferred by the bank
to a new State institution then recently incor-
porated, ra trust, for the discharge of its debts and
* the settlement of its affairs-. With this trustee, by
authority of Congress-, an adjustment tras subse-
quently made of the large interest which the Go-
vernment had in. the stock of the institution. The
manner m which a trust unexpectedly created upon
the act granting the charter, and involving such
great publ c interests, has been executed, would,
under any circumstances, be a fit subject of inquiry;
but much more does it de«erve your attention,
when it embraces the redemption of obligations to
which the authority and credit oí the United States
have given value The two year , allowed are now
near'y at an end. It is well understood that the
tiustee has not redeemed and cineelled (he out-
slan ling notes of the bink, but has reissued, and is
actually reissuing, since the third of March, 1836,
the notes which hive been recen ed by it to a vast
amount. According to its own official statement.
so late at, the first of October last, nineteen months
after the banking privileges given by the char-
ter had evpired, it had under Us control un-
cancelled notes of the late Bank of the United
States to the amount oí twenty-seven millions five
hundred arid sixty-one thotisind eight hundred
and sixty-six doláis, of which six millions one
hundred and seventy-five thousand eight hun-
dred and sixti-one dollars were tn actual cir-
culation, one million four hundred and sixty-
eight thousand six hundred and twenty-seven dol-
lars at Stale bank agencies, and three millions two
thousand thiee bundled and ninety dollars in ¡nm-
sjíit; thus showing that upwards of ten millions
and a hall ol the notes of the old bank weie then
still kept outstanding. The improprio!} of this pro-
cedure is obvioui' it being the duty of the trustee
to cancel and not to put foith the notes of an institu-
tion, whose concerns it had undertaken to wind up.
If the trustee has a right to leissuc these notes now,
I can see no reason why it may not continue to do
so after the expiration of the two years As no one
could have ami lputetl a course so extraordinary,
the prohibitory clause of the ehuler abo\c quoted
was not accompanied by any penalty or other spe-
cial piovMon ins enloicmg Hi nor have we any ge-
netal law fot the prevention of similar acts in fu-
ture.
But it is not in this view of the sublet alone
that your mterp  sihon is reqmitd The United
States, m "willing with the trustee for their stock,
have uiih.di.twn their funds from their fotmer
duect liability to the etetlitors ol the old bank, jet
notes ol the institution continue to be sent lortli in
itsjmimo, and apparently upon the authotity of the
United Sttilis The tiansactions connected with
the employment ol the bills oí the old bank aie of
vast extent, and should they result unforiutiattl},
the interests of individuals may be deeply compro-
mised WuhMit undertaking to decide how far,
or m what form, if any, the trustee could be made
liable for notes which contain no obligation on its
pa't, or the old bink, for such as are put m cir-
culation alter the expiration of its charter, and
without its authority ; or the Government for in-
demnity , n rase of loss, the question still presses
itself upon your consideration, whether it is con-
sistent vvnli duty and good faith on the part of the
Government, to witnc ? this proceeding without a
Single effort to arrest it.
The report of the Commissioner of the General
Land Othce, winch will belaid before you by the
Secretary of the Treasury, will show how the
affaus of that office have been conducted for the
past year The disposition of the public lands is
one of the most important trusts confided to Con-
gress. The piaclicabiluy of retaining the title
and contiol of such extensive domains m the Gene-
ral Government, anil at the same time admiten
the Terr tones embracing therri into the Federal
Union as coequals -Kith the original States, was
seriously doubted by many of our wisest states-
men All feared that they would become a sourc
of discord, and many carried their apprehension 
so far as to see in them the seeds of a future disso-
lution of the Confederacy.   But happily our sjpe-
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
rience has already been sufficient to quiet, in a
great degree, all such apprehensions. The posi-
tion, at one time assumed—that the admission
of new States into the Union on the same foot-
iH with the onainal States, w?s incompatib'e
with a right of soil in the United Siate-, and
operated as a surrender thereof, notwithstanding
the terms of the compacts by which their admission
was designed to be regulated—has been wisely
abandoned. Whether in the new or the old State ,
all now agree that the right of soil to the public
lands remains in the federal Government, and
that these lands constitute a common pioperty, to
be disposed of for the common benefit of all the
States, old and new. Acquiescence in this just
principle by the people of the new Stales has na-
turally promoted a disposition lo adopt the most
hbetal policy in the sale of the public lands A
policy which should be limited lo the meie object
ot selling the lands for the greatest possible sum
of money, without regard to higher consideration?,
finds but few advocates On the contrary, it is ge-
nerally conceded, that whilst the mode of disposi-
tion adopted by the Government, should always be
a prudent one, yet its leadms obj et ought to be
the early settlement and cultivation of the lands
sold; and ihst it should discountenance, if it cannot
prevent, the accumulation of large tiacts in the
same hands, which must necessarily retard the
growth of the new States, or entail upon thtm a
dependent tenantry, and its attendant evils
A question embracing such important interests,
and so welt calculated to enlist the feelings of the
people in every quarter of the Union, has very na-
urally given n?e to numerous plans for the im-
provement of the existing system The distinctive
featuies of the policy that has hitherto prevailed,
are, to dispose of the public lands at moderate
prices, thus enabling a greater number to entei into
competition for their purchase, and accomplishing
a double object of promoting their rapid sett'ement
by the pmchascrs, and it the «ame time increasing
the receipts of the Treasun , to sell for cash,
thereby preventing the disturbing influence of a
large mass of private citizens indebted to the Go-
vernment, which they have a voice in controlling,
to bring them into market no faster thin good lands
are supposed to be wanted for improvements,
thereby preventing the accumulation ol large traits
in few hands; and to apply the proceeds of the
sales to the genetal purposes of the Government;
thus diminishing the amount to be msed fiom the
p°opIeofthe States by taxation, and gtvingeath State
its poition of the benefits to be derived from this
common fund in a manner the most quiet, and at
the same time, perhaps, the mist equitable, that
can be devised Thest provisions, with occasional
enactments m behalf of special interests deemed
entitled to the favor of the Government, have, m
their execution, produced results as beneficial up-
on the who'e as could reasonably be expected in a
matter so vast, so complicated, and so exciting.
Upward  of seventy millions of acres have been
sold, the greater part of which is believed to have
been purchased for actual settlement. The popu-
lation of the new States and Territories creat-d
out of the public domain, increised between 1800
and 1830 fiom less than sixty thousand to upwards
ot two millions three hundred thousand souls,
constituting, at the latter period, about one-fifth
of the whole people of the United States The in-
crease since cannot be accutately known, but the
whole may now be safelv estimated at over three
and a half millions of souls, compos ng nine States,
the representatives of which constitute above one-
third of the Senate, and over one-sixth of the
House of Representatives of the United States.
Thus has been formed a body of free and inde-
pendent landholders, with a rapidiy unequalled in
the history of mankind; and this great result has
been produced without leaving ary thing for fu-
ture adjustment between the Government and its
oi'i?<ms. The system under which so much has
been accomplished cannot be intrms cally bad,
and with occasional modifications, to correct
abuses and adapt it to changes of circumstances,
may, I think, be safely trusted for the future.
There is, in the management of such extensive
inter«!% orach virtue ia stability, and although

grest and obvious improvements should not be de-
clined, changes should never be made without the
fullest examination, and the clearest demonstra-
tion of their practical utility. In the history of
the past, we have an assurance that this s-ife rule
of action will not be" departed from in relation tc
the public hnds; nor is it believed that any ne-
cessity exists for interfering with the fun lamenlal
principles of the system, or that the public mini1,
even in the new States, is desirous of any radical
alterations. On the contrary, the genet al deposi-
tion appears to be, to make such modifications
and additions only as will the more effectually
cairy out the original policy of filling our new
States and Territories with an industrious and in-
dependent population.
The modification most persevermgly pressed
upon Congiess, which has occupied so mucli of
its time for years past, and will probably do so for
a long time to come, if not sooner satisfactorily ad-
justed, is a reduction m the cost of such poittonsof
the public lands as are ascertained to be unsalea-
ble at the rate now established by law, and a gra-
duation, according to their relative value, of the
prices at which they may hereafter he «old It is
worthy of consideration whether justice may not
be done to every interest in this matter, and a vexed
question set at rest, perhaps for ever, by a reason-
able compromise of conflicting opinions Hitherto,
after being offered at public sale, lands have been
disposed of at one uniform price, whatever differ-
ence there might be in their intrinsic va'ue. The
leading considerations urged in favor of the mea-
sure referred to are, that in almost all the land dis-
tricts, and partícula! ly m those in which the lands
have been long surveyed and exposed to sale,
there are still remaining numerous, and large tracts
of every gradation of value, from the Government
price downwards , thai these lands will nt t be pur-
chased at the Government puce, so long as bettei
can be conveniently obtained fir the same amount,
that there are large tracts which even the improve-
ments of the adjacent lands will never rai'e to that
price; and that the present uniform price, com-
bined with their irregular value, operates to prevent
a desirable compactness of settlement m the new
States, and to retard the full development u{ that
wise policy on which our land system is founded,
to the injury not only of the several Sntes wheie
the lands he, but 9f the United Suites as a vvho'o
The remedy proposed has been a reduction of
prices according to the length ot tune the 1- nds ha1 e
been in market, without íeference to any otrrr cr-
cumstances. The certainty that the eiHux of time
would not always in such cases, and peihaps not
even generally, furnish a true cutcnon of ,alue;
and the probability that persons residing in the
vicinity, as the period for the reduction of prices
approached, would postpone purchases they would
other vise make, for the purpose of availing them-
selves of the lower price, with other considerations
of a similat character, have hitherto been success-
fully urged to defeat the graduation upon time
May not all reasonable desires upon this subject
be satisfied without encoun'eurg any of these ob-
jections'1 All will conced  the abstract principle,
that the price of the public lmds «hon'd be p-opoi-
tioned to their relative value, so fai as that can Is

been adopted by many of the S'ates as the basis
of taxation—an actual valua'ion of lands, and
