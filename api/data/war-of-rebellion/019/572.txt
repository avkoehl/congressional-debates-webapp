SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 15, 1862.

General LOAN,

Laclede, via Brookfield:

Concentrate your entire available force on the river at Lexington or above. Should the rebels from below cross over, make preparation to cross the river and go south, if necessary, with as much force as can be spared from your division. I would like you to command in person for the present at least. Lose no time in reaching the vicinity of Lexington, and inform me via Lexington of your movements. Answer.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 15, 1862.

General MERRILL,

Hudson, Mo.:

The arms at Hannibal are for General Loan. You can take a part of them if you need them at once. I will send 1,000 more immediately. I want two or three of your best companies of cavalry for a few days' service in Saint Louis County. Several hundred well armed, well mounted rebels have collected in the county. I must have disciplined troops to give them the castigation so much needed. Send them to me at once, if possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 15, 1862.

General TOTTEN,

Jefferson City, Mo.:

General Loan is ordered to Lexington with his entire force. Will certainly reach that place before Coffee can. Rains and Coffee were at Lamar yesterday with about 3,000 men. They can hardly have passed Colonel Warren, who is also moving north. If so, our troops must move faster or they can never whip the rebels.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SPRINGFIELD, August 15, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:

Major Montgomery will be at Greenfield to-night and form a junction with Colonel King's command. Before moving from Greenfield I shall know what is doing in Arkansas. Rains and Coffee have moved north from Lamar. They must know that they have nothing to apprehend from Kansas troops.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., August 15, 1862-12 m.

Brigadier-General BLUNT,

Commanding Department of Kansas:

GENERAL: Your communication of the 13th instant was received a moment ago. I hasten to reply. Events have transpired rapidly within a few days. As I wrote you a few days since, threatened with attack by 700 or 800 men I fell back toward the Missouri River from Santa
