HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, Va., July 25, 1864-8 p.m.

Lieutenant Colonel L. RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report everything quiet in my front during the last twelve hours. The enemy threw a number of shell considerably to the rear of the second line toward sunset, and about the same time there was an explosion, apparently opposite General Potter's front, followed by cheering. The cause of this I was not able to ascertain.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, you obedient servant,

JAMES H. LEDLIE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, NINTH CORPS,July 25, 1864-8 a.m.

Colonel RICHMOND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report the usual musketry firing through the night, notwithstanding the rain and darkness. The rain was left in the trenches by the men. Three regiments of the First Brigade had to stand up, General Hartranft says, all night. The working party for to-day need not be greater than 200 or 300, if they can be spared.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,July 25, 1864-8 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND, A. A. G., Ninth Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that considerable mortar-firing, more than usual, on the part of the rebels, and also firing from a battery on our left, heretofore silent, took place his p.m., to which our batteries replied with good effect. A shell from Captain Smiley's mortar battery blew up a magazine in the rebel work left of New Market road. The explosion was greater than either of the previous, causing loud cheering in our line. I have before applied for more previous, causing would again urge the propriety of availing ourselves of our superior resources to gain advantage over the rebels in this respect. At present the number of mortars on both sides seems equal.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 25, 1864.

General WHITE:

The commanding general desires you to direct Colonel Sigfried to report in person at once to General Willcox. He is now at these headquarters. He will have his command in readiness to move.

Very respectfully,

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
