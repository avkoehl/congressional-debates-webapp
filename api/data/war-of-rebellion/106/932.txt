ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Hdqrs. District of Oregon, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of July 25, received on the 4th instant. I communicated with Captain Drake before leaving Fort Dalles, giving him all the information I possessed. Captain Currey returned to Camp Maury from here on the 25th ultimo in full possession of my views and plans, and at any time I deem it necessary I shall send to Captain Drake. Lieutenant Olney will start in that direction in about ten days, and will see Captain Drake before he returns. I have nothing to report of importance. Lieutenant Olney will go next week to Yreka Valley north of John Day's. His movement has been delayed awaiting the arrival of pack animals.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. CALDWELL,

Captain, First Oregon Cav., Commanding Canyon City Road Expedition.
