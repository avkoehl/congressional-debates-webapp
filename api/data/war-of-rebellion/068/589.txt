Major-General BUTLER:

A few of the enemy's cavalry are on the turnpike on our right. Can you not send and drive them away or capture them? There may be a heavier force behind them and the pike should be struck by the cavalry this side of the creek you mention.

Major-General GILLMORE:

I would respectfully suggest to you that I think we can capture a force of rebels supposed to be stationed at the Junction, if you will swing your right well around so as to come in their rear. We can then destroy the road at our leisure.

Very respectfully,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
