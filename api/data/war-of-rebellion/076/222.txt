GENERAL THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS,

Four miles from Atlanta, July 21, 1864-7.30 p. m.

(Received 11 p. m.)

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT,

Assistant Superintendent, U. S. Military Telegraph:

Very little progress to-day, McPherson having gained no ground. General Palmer, on extreme right, has pushed enemy from south bank of Peach Tree Creek, and reached railroad. Skirmishing sharp and lively all day, but no general engagement. We shall bounce them to-morrow. Rousseau has been successful, and has struck railroad between Montgomery and Opelika severely- so say rebel papers.

J. C. VAN DUZER.

SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. MIL. DIV. OF THE MISS., In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., Numbers 40. July 21, 1864.

The operations of the enemy to-morrow, July 22, will be as follows:

I.

They will keep their men well in hand to repel assault, or to follow to the enemy's main line of entrenchments.

II. Major-General Thomas, will put the whole or a part of General McCook's cavalry to watch the peninsula between Peach Tree Creek and the Chattahoochee, and will press his lines forward close upon the enemy, endeavoring to advance his right so as to extend across the railroad and main road from Marietta.
