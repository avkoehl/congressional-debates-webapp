HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,
Shreveport, August 13, 1864.

Major General S. B. BUCKNER,

Commanding District of West Louisiana:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Smith to inclose to you for your information the accompanying letter to Colonel Isaac F. Harrison. It relates to a proposition made by a Captain Glenney, of one of the enemy's gun-boats, Numbers 1, to deliver up the boat to Colonel Harrison for a consideration. Should Colonel Harrison succeed in getting possession of the boat and signals, it will have an important bearing upon the crossing of troops. The proposition comes through a planter (Briscoe) living on the river near Saint Joseph, whose letter to Colonel Harrison has been placed before General Smith. This planter is satisfied that the boat can be secured for a consideration. If successful in capturing one, others may be taken. Secrecy and dispatch are requisite for success.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GUY M. BRYAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, August 13, 1864.

Colonel I. F. HARRISON:

COLONEL: I am directed by General Smith to say to you that he has conversed with General Wigfall in relation to the subject treated of in the letter of Mr. Briscoe to you, of the 4th instant, which General Wigfall has shown to him. He directs that you see the captain of the boat and have an understanding with him; that the captain of the navy in command here is temporarily absent. As soon as he returns provisions will be made to send officers, and part of the crew of the Missouri. In the meantime, however, if you find that you can get men in your command or elsewhere competent and in sufficient numbers to answer your purposes, you need not wait the arrival of the men from here. You must be the judge of your course of action under the circumstances. You will communicate promptly what transpires to these headquarters. You are authorized to make terms with the captain, which he will carry out to the extent of his means and ability. The boat had better go down the river as he learns there is sixteenth feet at the mouth of Red River.

Respectfully, &c.,

GUY M. BRYAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, August 13, 1864.

Colonel I. F. HARRISON:

COLONEL: I am instructed by General Smith to say to you that having seen General Wigfall he understands that you have the impression that the recent orders you have received directing you to move to Arkansas have been induced by certain reports spoken of by you to General Wigfall derogatory of yourself. He requests me to say to you that these reports have had no influence upon him, but that your orders were given in reference to concentration of troops for a campaign.

I am, very respectfully, &c.,

GUY M. BRYAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
