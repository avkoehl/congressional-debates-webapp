HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,Fort Leavenworth, May 14, 1864.

Brigadier General S. N. WOOD,

Kansas State Militia, Council Grove, Kans.

GENERAL: Your private letter, informing me that cattle are being brought by traders from Texas that you think have been stolen, is duly received. While at Fort Scott and Humboldt I directed all the cattle s stopped and carefully examined to see whether they were contraband or otherwise, and I reported my action to be Interior and War Departments, asking for information. I received information that the Indians country was taken from my command. I am also informed that the refugee Indians are to be returned to their own country, where I think they will have need of all their cattle and hope they will take care of them. It is very certain I have not troops to stop the contraband trade and consider it quite useless to try, the line being, as you see, 200 or 300 miles long where the traders can pass.

Respectfully, yours,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,Fort Leavenworth, May 14, 1864.

Brigadier General S. N. WOOD,

Kansas State Militia, Council Grove, Kans.:

GENERAL: Yours of the 18th, conveying one from Captain Akin, from Chelsea, of the 6th, and both giving information concerning the southwestern portion of Kansas, are duly received. I am glad to get such intelligence and will always do all in my power to meet pending danger. I wrote you very fully, a few days ago, informing you of my lack of Federal troops and urging just what you seem to be doing-that is, the organization of the militia to act in case of invasion. I have no reply from my telegram to the honorable Secretary of War, urging the organization, and occasion requires the use of the militia, but suppose, the organization, and occasion requires the use of the militia, but suppose everything is now suspended to see the result of the great struggle in Virginia. I send a company from Riley to Larned, and expect also troops from Colorado soon. Keep a close watch and ward in your district, where, as you say, militia are the main dependence.

Respectfully, yours,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
