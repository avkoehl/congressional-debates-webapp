Major R. S. DAVIS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Last evening (Friday) I received an order, dated the 27th instant, to report to General Birney on (Thursday) the morning of the 28th. It was of course impossible to comply with the order at the date of its reception. I returned to my camp here at 6 o'clock this morning, but have since received orders from General Sheridan to report to him at Lee's Mill, with two days' forage and three days' rations, and shall be ready to march soon after noon. I make this report for the information of the major-general commanding the department.
