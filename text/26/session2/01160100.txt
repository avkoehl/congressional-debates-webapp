CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. W. also presented a memorial from manu
facturers, merchants, mechanics, and o her persons

a bankrupt law, which they think would be a pro
per one; which was laid on the table, and ordered
to be printed
Mr. RUGGLE3 presented the memorial of citi-
zens of Bucfoport, Maine, remonstrating against the
repeal of the fishing bounties and allowances, which
was read
Mr BENTON gave notice that in a few days he
would make an effort to bring this question before
the Senate, when he would show that two-third  of
these fishing bounties were a palpable violation of
the Constitution of the United States There is at
present before Congress a proposition to borrow
money by issuing Treasury notes, a portion of
which must go to the payment  of thrse fishing
bounties. He repeated that he wou d conclusively
demonstrate that to the amount of two thirds of
these allowances they wer? a naked bounty from
the Treasury, and of course unconstitutional
Mr. NORVELL presented a memorial trom the
heirs and legal representatives of the Chevoher de
Repentigny, by C E Violet, their attorney, and a
memorial from Agnes Slacke The former me-
morial claims for the memorialists, citizpns of
France, jointly with Agnes Slacke, of Ireland, a
tract of land at the Sault S e Mar e, in theS ate of
Michigan, "six leagues on the portage by six leagues
in depth on the river separating the two lakes " This
land (said Mr Norví.ll) is alleged to have been
granted as a concession, in 1750, by the French
Canadian au'honties, to Captain de Bonne and the
Chevalier de Repentigny, for the purpose of esta-
blishing thereon a seignory The grant is furtner
stated to have been ratified by the King of France
in 1751 Agnes Slacke derives her claim to a
moiely of this concession from sales or grants made
by Captain de Bonne Mr Noryell said that he
had prevented these memorials by request He
censidered tbem as important to the claimants, i n-
portant m their consequences to the Slate ot Michi-
gan, and important to the United States He
therefore moved that they be printed, and, with the
papers which accompanied them, referred to the
Committee on Private Land Claim* He would"
ask the particular attention of that committee to
the subject, with as speedy action and as early a
decision on it as mght be consistent with their con-
venience.
The motion was agreed to

The joint resolution d'reeting the transfer to the
State of Maryland ot the stoce m the Chesareake
and Ohio Canal, standing in the name of the
United State*, upon certain conditions, was then ta
ken up
Mr MANGUMsaid, z% this matter was of much
importance tothe citizens of the District, who had
no representative here, and as a íemonstrance
against the passage of the bill, which he had pre-
sented some days since, had not yet relumed from
the printer, he hoped the further consideration of
the  bill would be po tponed for a few days.
Mr MERRICK urged the immediate action of
the Senate as necessary to enable ihe Legislature of
Maryland, who had ihe subject at this moment un-
der consideration, to enable them to act under-
standing^ The stock at present was of no value,
and Congress haung in their wisdom determined
ti make no further appropriations to complete the
work, their holding on to the stock only operated
to deter Maiyland from making efforts to complete
the canal to Cumberland As to the memorial of
the corporate authorities of Washington, it was
only remonstrating against the United Stales dis-
posing of their own property, with which they
had no more right to interfere than ihe citizens of
any oiher portions of the Republic
Mr WALKER said several yeais since he had
introduced a bill, somewhat similar to that now
pending for the leUnqw hment of our stock m the
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal to the State of Mary-
land He had done this after a conference with a
distinguished patriot, [Governoi Kent,] then a
Senator from Marjland, but now called to a
higher and better world At thaf time, he (Mr
Walkeb) had called upon the Secretary of the
Treasury to leport what dividends theGivernment
of the United States had received fiom its stock in
all thes" canals, namely, this caí al, the Chesa-
peake and Delaware Canal, the D smal Swamp
Canal, and the Ohio Canal at Louisville The re-
port then made showed that these slocks, with the
exception of the last, had never yielded any divi-
dend, that they had no market price, and m all
probability never v. ould yield any dividend, espe-
cially this stock id the Chesapeake snd Ohio Canal
Under these circumstmces, Mr Walker said he
was in favor of dissolving this unprofitable part
nership between this Gove-nment and this com-
pmy, by ihe surrender of this stock to the State of
Maryland Mr Walker said whievei would
read the early debates and reports on thii suoject
in both Houses ot Congress, could not fril to ob-
serve, that this Government had originally intended
to proceed, pan passu with the State of Maryland,
in subscriptions to th s canal, considering it as a
great national woik, terminating m this District
This design was now abandoned, mo^t happily, to-
gether with the whole internac improvement sys-
tem by Congress, but, in ihe mean time, the
Stale of Marylaid, relying on the continued co-
operation ot this Government in the cons ruction
ot this canal, had proceeded and e\pei ded enor-
mous sums towards tbp compltt on of this great
work, and whilst he (Mi Walker) would not,
even under these c rcums anees, vo e to appropri-
ate more money to this tr any ether similai ob
ject of internal improvement by this. Government,
yet he thought it a mere act of jus ice to suirender
this stock, (not without an equivalent,) but for the
full equivalent proviled in ton. bill, namely the
u«eof this canal forevei, free of all toll, for tha
transportation of the troips end mumt ons of war
of this Government, and upon simi]ai terms Mr
Walker was willing to surrender to he State* m
which they were located, all the stock he d by this
Government in all other canals and thus to com-
plete the divoice between tbis Government and the
whole internal improvement system In ¡elation
to the stock held by this Government m the Lou-
isville canal, Mr Walkfr desired to cede our
stock in that canal to the State cf Kentucky, so as
to be made auxiliary to the great object of ren-
denng that canal free of all toll, and thus re-
move that heavy taxation which was now im-
posed on those who travelled or transported
products on the Ohio river In relation to the op-
position en the part of this city to this transfer,
Mr W said he regretted it. The completion of
this canal by Marvland would be of vast import-
ance to this city, and «he ought ts sapport this bill
as f?ci!itating the completion of this work, and as
to the idea that Maryland might, by obtaining the
control of this stock, abandon the canal to this city,
by carrying the canal from a point out of this Dis-
trict to Baltimore, it was deissive Now, Mr.
W said, a survey for Maryland, by the accom-
pl shed head of our Topographical Bureau, had
been made, by which it was demonstrated that all
other routes for a cross cut from ibis canal to Balti-
more had been found impracticable, except through
this city. Mr W said that this bill had passed
the Senate at the last session by a large majority,
and he hoped it would now be permitted to pass
without delay.
On motion of Mr CLAY by A'abama, the
for taking up the spec al order having arrived
joint resolution was laid on the table
PERMANENT PROSPECTIVE PRE EMPTION LAW
The bill to establish a peimanent prospective
pre emption system, in favor of settlers on the pub-
lic lands, who shall inhabit and cultivate the same,
and raise a log cabm thereon, being the special or-
der of the day, was taken up, the question being
on the amendment offered by Mr Calhoun to the
motion to recommit the bill made by Mr Critten-
den
Mr. SEVIER addressed the Senate at length in
favor of the amendment submitted by Mr. Cal-
houv, and of the original bill, and m opposition to
the substitute proposed by Mr. Chittenden
Mr SMITH of Indiana followed in opposition
to Mr Calhoun's amendmen', and spoke for
about an hour, when, without concluding, he yield-
ed to a motion for adjournment.
And the Senate then adjourned.
