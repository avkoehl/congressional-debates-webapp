and any one so offending shall forfeit one hun-
dred dollars for each offence ; and no steamer
carrying passengers shall depart from any port
unless she shall have in her service a full com-
plement of officers and crew, sufficient at all
times to manage the vessel, including the proper
number of watchmen : Provided, however, That
if any such vessel, on her voyage, is deprived
of the services of any licensed officer, without
the consent, fault, or collusion of the master,
owner, or of any person interested in the ves-
sel, the deficiency may be temporarily supplied
until others licensed can bo obtained.
Sec. 15. And be it further enacted, That
when any persons [shall] apply to be licensed
as captain or master of steam-vessels, the in-
spectors shall make diligent inquiry as to his
character, and shall carefully examine the ap-
plicant as well as the proofs which he presents
in support of his claim, and if they are satis-
fied that his capacity, experience, habits of
life, and character are such as to warrant the
belief that he can be safely intrusted with the
duties and responsibilities of the station for
which he makes application, they shall grant
him a license authorizing him to discharge such
duties on any such vessel for the term of one
year; but such license shall be suspended or
revoked, upon satisfactory proof of bad con-
duct, intemperate habits, incapacity, inatten-
tion to his duties, or the wilful violation of any
provision of this act.
Sec. 10. And be it farther enacted, That

dence of the knowledge, experience, and skill

as to his knowledge and ability in navigation
and managing such vessels, and all other duties
pertaining to his station; and if satisfied of ln3
qualifications and good character, they sh3.ll
grant him a license, authorizing him to perform
such duties for the term of one year; but such

habits, unskillfulness, or want of knowledge
of the duties of his station, or the wilful vio-
lation of any provisions of this act.
Sec. 17. And be it further enacted, That
when any person shall apply for authority to
perform the duties of engineer of any steamer,
the inspectors shall examine the applicant as
to his knowledge of steam machinery, and his
experience as an engineer, and also the proofs
which he produces in support of his claim ;
and if, upon full consideration, they are satis-
fied that his character, habits of life, knowl-
edge, and experience in the duties of an engin-
eer are all such as to authorize the belief that
the applicant is a suitable and safe person to
be intrusted with the powers and duties of
such a station, they shall grant him a license,
authorizing him to be employed in such duties
for the term of one year, in which they shall
assign him to the appropriate class of engin-
eers ; but such license shall be suspended or
revoked upon satisfactory proof of negligence,
unskillfulness, intemperance, or the wilful vio-
lation of any provision of this act; but if
complaint be made against any engineer hold-
ing a license authorizing him to take charge of
the boilers and machinery of any steamer, that
he has, through negligence or want of skiil,
permitted the boilers in his charge to burn or
otherwise become in bad condition, or that he
has not kept his engine and machinery in good
working order, it shall be the duty of the in-
spectors, upon satisfactory proof of such negli-
gence or want of skill, to revoke his license
and assign such engineer to a lower grade or
class of engineers if they find him fitted thereof
[therefor].
Sec. 18. And be it further enacted, That
whenever any person claiming to be a skillful
pilot of steam-vessels shall offer himself for a

he possesses the requisite knowledge and skill,
and is trustworthy and faithful, they shall grant
him a license for the term of one year to pilot
any such vessel within the limits prescribed in
the license; but such license shall be suspended
or revoked upon satisfactory evidence of neg-
ligence, unskillfulness, or inattention to the
duties of his station, or for intemperance, or
the wilful violation of any provision of this act.

pilot who shall receive a license as aforesaid
shall, when employed upon any such vessel,
place his certificate of license (which shall be
framed under glass) in some conspicuous place
in such vessel, where it cajj be seen by pas-
sengers and others at all times; and for every
neglect to comply with this provision by any
such captain, mate, engineer, or pilot, he shall
be subject to a penalty of one hundred dollars'
fine, or to the revocation of his license: Pro-
vided, That in cases where the captain or mate
is also pilot of the vessel, he shall not be re-
quired to hold two licenses to perform such
duties, but the license issued shall state on its
face that he is authorized to act m such double
capacity.
Sec. 10. And be it f arther enacted, That the
said local boards of inspectors shall investigate
all acts of incompetency or misconduct com-
mitted by any su^li licensed officer while act-

such local inspectors are hereby authorized to
administer all necessary oaths to any witnesses
thus sumnioned before them, and after reason-
able notice in writing, given to the alleged
delinquent, of the time and place of such in-
vestigation, the said witness shall be examined
under oath touching the performance of his
duties by any such licensed officer, and if the
board shall be satisfied thatsuch licensed officer
is incompetent, or has been guilty of misbeha-
vior, negligence, unskillfulness, or has endan-
gered life, or willfully violated any provision
of this act, they shall immediately suspend or
revoke his license, and the chief officer of the
customs for the district shall pay out of the
revenues received under the provisions of this
act such fees to the United States marshal for
his services, and to any witness so summoned
for his actual travel and attendance, as shall
be officially certified to by any inspector hear-
ing the case, upon the back of such summons,
not exceeding the rate allowed for fees and to
witnesses for travel and attendance iu any cir-
cuit or district courts of the Uuited States.
Sec. 20. And be it further^nacted, That
whenever any board of local inspectors refuse
to grant a license to any person applying for
the same, or shall suspend or revoke the license
of any captain, mate, engineer, or pilot, any
person deeming himself wronged by such re-
fusal, suspension, or revocation, may, within
thirty days thereof, on application to the super-
vising inspector of the district, have his case
examined anew by such supervising inspector,
and the local board shall furnish to the super-
vising inspector, in writing, the reasons for
their dpings in the premises; and such super-
vising inspector shall examine the case anew,
and he shall have the same powers to summon
witnesses and compel their attendance, and to
administer oaths, that are conferred on the
local inspectors by the terms of this act, and
such witnesses and the marshal shall be paid
in the same manner as hereinbefore provided
for; and such supervising inspector may re-
voke, change, or modify the decision of such
local board; and like proceedings may be had
by any master or owner of any steam-vessel in
relation to the inspection of such vessel, or her
boilers or machinery, by any such'local board;
and in case of repairs, and in any investiga-
tion or inspection, where there shall be a dis-
agreement between the local inspectors, the
supervising inspector, when so requested, shall
investigate and decide the case.
Sec. 21. And be it further enacted, That.,
in addition to the annual inspection, it shall
be the duty of the local inspectors to examine,
at proper times, steamers arriving and depart-
ing to and from their respective ports so often
as to enable them to detect any neglect to
comply with the requirements of law, and also
any delects or imperfections becoming apparent
after the inspection aforesaid, and tending to
render the navigation of the vessels unsafe ;
and if they shall discover any omission to
comply with the law, or that repairs have
become necessary to make the vessel safe, the
said inspectors shall at once notify the master
in writing, stating in the notice what is required ;
and it' the master deems the requirements
unreasonable or unnecessary, he may apply
for a re-examination of I he case to the super-
vising inspector, as hereinbefore provided ; and
if the master or owner shall refuse or neglect
to comply with the requirements of the local
inspectors, and shall, contrary thereto and
while the same remains unreversed by the
supervising inspector, employ the vessel by
navigating her, the master and owners and the
vessel itself shall he liable to the penalty as
prescribed by the first section of this act, and
in addition thereto shall be liable for any damage
to passengers and their baggage which shall
occur from any defects as stated in the notice
aforesaid. And all inspections and orders for
repairs shall be promptly made by the inspect-
ors, and, when it can be safely done in their
judgment, they shall permit repairs to be made
