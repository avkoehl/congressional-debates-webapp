DAVID BRUCE.
The bill (II. R. No, 269) for the relief of David

It empowers the Commissioner of Patents to
extend the patent of David Bruce, dated Novem-
ber 6, 1843, for a new and improved mode of cast-
! ing type, for seven years from the date of its ex-
1 piration, subject to the rules and regulations now
! in force for granting extensions; provided it shall
j appear on examination that the failure to extend
; his patent occurred through an official mistake.
I; Mr. PUG11. T object to that bill.
;[ Mr. REID. Will the Senator permit me to
j; make u remark, which 1 think will satisfyhim in
relation to the bill?
; Mr. PUGU. Certainly.
I Mr. REID. Thus is not to grant an extension
! of a patent. It expired some time during the last
S year. Before its expiration, the patentee made
| application for a renewal in time, and the exam-
[ iner made his report, but one of the clerks mis-
] placed the leport, so that the Commissioner did
; not act upon it until after the expiration of the
| time, and then dccided that he could not take up
the easo because the clerk had made the mistake,
| and the papers had not reached him in.time. This
I bill is meiely to permit him to take up the case
| and examine it as he could have done if his clerk
1 had not made the mistake. The case is not at
! all changed. The bill only gives the right to ex-
; amine it, as the Commissioner would have done
, if the clerk had not made the mistake,
j Mr. PUGf-I. IIow long did the patent run?
; IJas it ever been renewed before ?
j; Mr. IUCID. It has never been renewed.
!' Mr. PUGH. I withdraw the objection,
i The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to
i a third reading, read the third time, and passed.

j1 Myer was read a second time, and considered as
in Committee of the Whole.
â–  J ft directs the payment to James Myer, late
! quartermaster to the Mexican boundary com-
: mission, of the sum of $1,093 71, being in full for
his time and expenses in returning to his home
after he-was relieved from duty as a member of
the commission.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to
be engrossed for a third reading, read the third:
time, and passed.
JANE J. WINGERD.
The bill (S. Wo. 429) for the relief of Jane J.
Wingerd was read a second time, and consid- '
ered as in Committee of the "Whole.
It directs the payment to "Jane J. Wingerd, of
the sum of $233 33, in full for two months' ser-
vices of her late husband, Jacob B. Wingerd,
deceased, as a temporary clerk in the office of the
First Comptroller of the Treasury in 1843.
Mr. TOOMBS. I object to that bill.
Mr.IVERSON. Will my colleague allow me
to make an explanation of the case to him?
Mr. TOOMBS. Certainly.
Mr. IVERSON. This is a poor woman; and
the facts of the case are simply these: in the
Comptroller's officc, one of the clerks became
largely behindhand; and the Comptroller found
it necessary to employ a temporary clerk to bring
up the business, and, by doing that, ho was en-
abled to transfer another clerk to a higher branch
of duty. This man Wingerd was employed in
the olBce'to perform the service for two months.
Mr. TOOMBS. This purports to have been in
1843, fifteen years ago.
Mr. IVERSON. I do not recollect the time.
Mr. TOOMBS. That is the date given, fifteen
years ago.
Mr. IVERSON. I hardly think it was so long
ago.
Mr. TOOMBS. I wish to know why the ser-
vices have never been paid for before, as they
were rendered fifteen years ago?
Mr. IVERSON. Read the report.
The Secretary read the report; from which it
appears, from a statement of James W. McCul-
loh, Esq., late First Comptroller of the Treasury, ,
that, in consequence of a large accumulation of
business m that office, in the year 1843, Mr. Ja-
cob B. Wingerd was duly sworn and employed
as a temporary clerk in that office for two months,
on a grade of service for which the regular clerks
were paid at the rate of $1,400 per annum. For
this service no payment has been made, there be-
ing no fund out of which to pay compensation to
extra clerks. Although the committee disapprove
of the employment of extra clerks in the Depart-
ments or bureaus without authority of law, yet,
as this service appears to have been regarded as
necessary by the Comptroller, and to have been
faithfully rendered, they think a proper compen-
sation ought to have been made.
Mr. TOOMBS. I object, unless some account
can be given of the fifteen years' delay.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be
passed over.
Mr. TOOMBS subsequently said: The Sena-
tor from Texas [Mr. Houston] having satisfied
me ill lrgard to the case of Jane J. Wingerd, I
withdraw my objection.
The lull was reported to the Senate, ordered to
be engrossed for a third reading, read the third
time, and passed.
SYLVANUSBURNHAM.

R. No 233) for the relief of Sylvanus Burnham.
It requires the Secretary of War to place the
name of Sylvanus Burnham upon the roll of in-
valid pensioners, and cause to be paid to him
eight dollars per month, commencing from and
after the 14th of November, 1850, and to continue
during his natural life.
Mr. CLAY. 1 object to that bill.
The bill was passed over.
CORNELIUS H. tATHAM.
The bill (H. R. No. 464) for the relief of Cor-
nelius II. Latham was considered as in Commit-
tee of the Whole.
it directs the Secretary of the Interior to allow
and pay Cornelius H. Latham, of New York, an
invalid pensioner, the sum of eight dollars per
month during his natural life, in lieu of the pen-
sion now allowed him by law, to commence on
the 25th of February, 185C.
Mr. PUGH. Let us hear the report in that
case.
The Secretary read it, and it appears that the
petitioner was, by special act of Congress for his
relief, approved July 17,1854, placed on the pen-
sion list, at the rate of four dollars per month, on
account of disease contracted while in the line of
his duty, in the service of the United States, as a
erivate in Captain E. V, Sumner's company of
nited States dragoons.
