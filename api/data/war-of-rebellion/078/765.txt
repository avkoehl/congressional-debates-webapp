ABBEVILLE, MISS., August 8, 1864.

Major-General FORREST, Okolona:

The enemy was driven back here last night. A column of 2,500 is reported at Toba Tubby Ferry. That is blocked and slightly guarded. It would scatter my force too much to send a regiment there, and if they cross I must fall back to Oxford.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

OKOLONA, August 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS, Oxford:

Have ordered Mabry, if his horses are broken down, to move his command from Grenada by rail, and report to you. I move everything to-morrow to Pontotoc. Let me hear from you there by courier. Will not more force from Pontotoc until I ascertain what direction enemy takes from Abbeville. I do not think enemy will go down Central road.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

OKOLONA, August 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS:

What facilities for crossing the river at Panola? How many boats are there?

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

ABBEVILLE, August 8, 1864.

General FORREST, Okolona:

Wade has been driven back from the crossing; has taken position on the first big hill this side.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

OKOLONA, August 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS, Abbeville:

Do not fall back to Oxford if you can possibly held it. Contest every inch of ground from Abbeville southward.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

ABBEVILLE, MISS., August 8, 1864.

Major-General FORREST, Okolona:

Henderson reports whole force - three DIVISIONS - in our front. They have driven us from the ford. I think the whole force a t pontotoc should be sent to Water Valley or Coffeeville at once; inform me if this is done.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.
