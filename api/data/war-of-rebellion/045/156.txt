HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., June 16, 1863.

(Copy received, War Department, 4 p. m.)

General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

Army supplies and troops sent by railroad trains should come in full daylight, as they may be fired on. I fear our lines are and will be out of our possession. If it is thought necessary to re-enforce this place, send the troops to come by railroad, to arrive here in full daylight. If any march, they must take all chances from the enemy and our fire. Let no body of men approach within 2 miles without notice by sending an officer forward.

DAN. TYLER.
