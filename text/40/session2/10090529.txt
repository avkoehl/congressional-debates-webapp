ratus, and such bonds shall be conditioned that

to be registered for the production of spirits in
his district, to estimate and determine its true
producing capacity, and in like manner shall
estimate and determine the capacity of any
such distillery as may hereafter be so registered
in said district, a written report of which shall
be made in triplicate, signed by the assessor
and the person aiding in making the same, one
copy of which shall be furnished to the distiller,
one retained by the assessor, and the other
immediately transmitted to the Commissioner

manner another survey of said distillery; the
report of said survey shall be executed in trip-
licate and deposited as hereinbefore provided.
