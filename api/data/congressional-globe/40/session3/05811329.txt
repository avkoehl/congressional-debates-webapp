tion of the Army; so thinks the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Siiellaiiarger] who has spoken his
words of warning in our hearing to-night.' So
think, I believe, a majority of the leaders asso-
ciated with him. Mississippi and Virginia and
Texas are still in political exile. In Georgia,
white men still hold out against tlie attempt to
degrade them to the level of an inferior race.
Therefore it is necessary in the estimation of
the Republican leaders that they should pro-
ceed gradually and cautiously and slowly in the
reduction and retrenchment of the war estab-
lishment of the country. I have not, there-
fore, any very sanguine hope that anything
will be accomplished during the present Con-
gress which will produce a material reduction
of the Army.
Under what circumstances do we find the
measure introduced? Iteomes not in the early
part of the session in the shape of an inde-
pendent measure as other important matters of
legislation are introduced. It comes at the
heel of the session, and is awkwardly tacked
upon an appropriation bill. As if to increase
the awkwardness of its situation, it encoun-
tered as soon as it came into the House an-
other rival and in many respects hostile prop-
osition. If, in the short time which still remains
to us, but twelve working days to the end of
the session, there should result under these
adverse circumstances a measure of Army re-
form which will meet with the approval of this
House, it will encounter the moment it reaches
the Senate another different, discordant, and
hostile proposition, which is already there
lying in wait forit; and between the disagreeing
doctors they will surely kill the patient. But
whatever be the fate of any measure for the
redaction of the Army which should pass the
House it is the duty of those who appreciate its
importance and necessity seriously to consider
and to aid, so far as they can, in the early
passage of the best practicable bill. And this
brings me to the consideration and compari-
son of the bills now before the House.
Mr. WOODWARD. I ask my colleague to
give way while I move that the committee rise.
Mr. BOYER. I will yield for that purpose.
Mr. BLAINE. If the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania will allow me I will state that when I
next move that the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole I shall also move that
general debate be closed in twenty minutes.
Mr. BOYER. That will give me time enough.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. The gentleman from
Pennsylvania cannot be taken off the floor by
a motion to close debate.
Mr. BLAINE. I thought the gentleman had
concluded.
Mr. WOODWARD. He retains the floor,
but yields to me to make the motion that the
committee rise.
Mr. BLAINE. Then, of course, I cannot
cut him off.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and Mr.
Cobb having taken the chair as Speaker pro
tempore, Mr. Ferry, reported that the Com-
mittee had, according to order, had the Union
generally under consideration, and particularly
Ilouse bill No. 1803, making appropriations
for the support of the Army for the year ending
June SO, 1870, and had come to no conclusion
thereon.
And then, on motion of Mr. FERRY, (at ten
o'clock p. m.,) the House adjourned.

Mr. POLAND. I ask unanimous consent

district of Vermont.
No objection being made, the bill was taken
up and read a first and second time. It pro-
vides that a regular term of ike circuit and dis-
trict courts of the United States for the district
of Vermont shall be held hereafter at Burling-

vided that this act shall not be construed to
authorize any expenditure for the use of a
building for such courts. Section two gives

<| jail on a part of the southerly side of a lot of
laud belonging to the United States in Burling-
ton on which the custom-house building stands ;
the United States courts to be held in said
court-house without charge for the use thereof,
and prisoners under the authority of the United j
States to be imprisoned in such jail; and for j
the nurposes aforesaid jurisdiction is ceded to l
the State of Vermont over the land so used '

Mr. CULLOM. Has this been referred to
the Committee on the Judiciary ?
Mr. POLAND. It is a Senate bill, and has
the unanimous concurrence of the delegation
from Vermont in both Houses, and the rec-
ommendation of the judges and everybody else.
Mr. CULLOM. I do not like to object.
No objection being made, the bill was read
a first, second, and third time, and passed.
Mr. POLAND moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
