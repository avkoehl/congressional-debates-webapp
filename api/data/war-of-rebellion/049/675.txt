General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Pursuant to orders, all my available force was sent this evening to New River Bredge. Should General Jones be mistaken and the enemy strike for Bonsack's or Salem, as is my own impressin, every thing east of those points would be utterly without defense. I would wish to have troops indicated upon ehim I could call for assistance, if necessary. If transportation were ready and the troops in rediness, I could get them fown in time from Gordonsville. I received a dispatch from Mr. Anderson, chirman of committee of safety of Botetourt County, saying th enemy are reported to be in Covington this morning.

General MARTIN,

Kinston:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I have your two notes by the hand of Colonel Moore, and first I must say that I am quite ignorant of the arrangements for defense about Kinston. It is, however, so important at least that the enemy shoud not have it, that in my opinion we must hod on as long as we can. If the deserter and Whitford news is correct, Peck has not the force to drive you from the position, especially if Ransom assists you. It seems to me that to give up Goldsborough and all our picket line now so importatnt in giving information.
