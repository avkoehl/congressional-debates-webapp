Major General JOHN E. WOOL, Commanding, Fort Monroe.

GENERAL; It is thought that it may be proper that General Huger should certainly know that thus far no person exposed or detected as a spy of the insurgents has been condemned or executed. You may informally communicate this fact without in any way committing the Government as to the future.

Truly, yours,

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Secretary of War.
