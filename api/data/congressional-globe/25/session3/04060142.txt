APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....3d Sess.
Salt Duties—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
act, at its passage, in the most determined manner
Granting that a part of this opposition was to de-
prive the Government of revenue, yet it is impos-
sible to suppose that the delegation of New Eng-
land would have so acted, if the protection of the
salt manufacture, and the encouragement of the
fisheries as a nursery of seamen, had been any
part of the object of the bill' It is certain that
these objects were no part of the intention of the
bill, and is equally certain, therefore, that the
Senator from Massachusetts is now wholly mis-
taken in attributing such intentions to it.
But the delegation of New England, in the
greater part,and Massachusetts especially, is now
in favor of the act which they so much opposed
at the time of its enactment • It is certain they are
for it now ' and the question is, to account for
this change. That is easily done. The salt duty
and its appendages was no source of profit—was
not a money-making business—at the time of the
enactment of the bill, it is noto a source of profit
—it is now a money-making business, and, there-
fore, the fishermen and their friends are unwilling
to repeal the bill, the enactment of which they so
much resisted at its passage. Great abuses have
grown up in this business, some of which ha\e
been detected, some of which are now apparent,
others of which are pretty well known to exist,
although the proof is not on the recoid, and thus
an allowance which was intended in 1813, to be
nothing but the refunding of a tax, is now at least
seven or eight times as much as the tax itself, even
supposing it to be paid A late Secretary of the
Treasury, Mr Ingham, during the shoi t time of
his administration of the Treasury Department,
detected above $,30,000 of illegal payments to these
fisheries, which he reported to Congress Some
salt manufacturers in Massachusetts, in their re-
port to the Secretary of the Treasury a fow years
ago, reported tlmtthni salt was used m the fisheries '
and from the gross amount of the allowance, and
the quantity offish exported, it is impossible that
'he quantity of salt has been exported upon the fish
which the large amount of the allowance supposes
But there is one point of view in which we have
data to make an accurate calculation of the amount
unduly received by the fiaheiies at this time it is
by comparing the amount which was formetly
paid, with what is now paid,and compaiing these
amounts with the duty on salt at the respective
periods of comparison. Thus, by the act ot 179-2,
when the salt duty was twelve cents per bushel,
and when the bounty in lieu of diawback on ex-
ported fish was ehilted from the exporter to the
fishing vessel, the allowance was fixed at $1 per
ton for vessels from five to twenty tons, $1 50 per
ton on vessels fiom twenty to thirty tons, and at
$2 50 per ton on vessels above thirty tons, with a
limitation of the maximum allowance to any one
vessel of more than $170 This was the allowance
in 1792, when the duty on salt was twelve cents a
bushel. But now, when the duty is but six cents
a bushel, these same allowances are respectively
swelled up into two or three times their original
amount, the $1 a ton on small vessels is raised to
$3 50, the $1 50 and $2 50 on larger vessels are
raised to $4 a ton, and the $170 maximum allow
anee is augmented to $360 Reduced to their proper
amounts, these allowances would be the one half
of what they were in 1792, that is to say, fifty
cents per ton for vessels from five to twenty
tons, seventy-five cents per ton to vessels between
tw«nty and thirty tons, and $1 25 per ton on all
Yessels above thirty tons, with a limitation of the
maximum allowance in favor of any one vessel to
$85 At these rates, the allowances would now
be about forty or fifty thousand dollars instead of
about $250,000 This is an abuse—a great and
palpable abuse—by which the Treasury loses near
$200,000 per annum, and the fishermen gam that
much more than they have a fair right to receive
And in this lies the secret of the change which has
taken place, a change which makes the friends
of the fishermen, formerly the enemies, now the
friends of the salt tax! The Treasury has paid,
in the whole, upwards of $6,000,000 to the fish-
eries under the idea of refunding a salt tax, a
large part of which has been unduly paid. It is
now paying about $250,000 per annum, four fifths
of which are unduly paid Surely it is time to
Btop these abuses, and the abolition—total aboli-
tion—of the salt duty, is the way to stop them.
While a vestige of that duty remains, the allow-
ances and the abuses will continue.
The Senator fiom Massachusetts [Mr Davis]
speaks of the increase of foreign seamen in our
service, and from that circumstance draws an ar-
gument in favor of the encouragement to our own
manners to be derived from these fishing bounties
Why, sir, does he not know that these allowances
go to foreigners as well as to citizens' That, pre-
vious to 1817, the whole allowance might have
gone to foreigners, and that it is only since that
time that this allowance is limited to one fourth
foreigners' The previous acts made no difference
in the national character of the fishermen to whom
the allowance was paid, it might all have gone to
foreigners, the act of 1817, after we had had a
war upon the subject of impressment of seamen,
was the first that introduced the distinction be-
tween aliens and citizens, and that act only went
the length of requiring three fourths of the fishing
crew to which the allowance was paid to be citi-
zens of the United States
Sir, (said Mr B ,) I thank the gentleman for
mentioning his subject of foreign seamen, it re-
minded me of a main argument which I had
omitted against this position, that these allow-
ances were granted to footer a nursery of Amen
can seamen What more conclusive agmnst that
position than that these allowances might hove
gone, by law,tn tolo, tofoieigners, up to the year
1817' and that since that time one fourth of their
amount may still go to them Yes, sir, $60,000
per annum—the one fourth of $250,000—may
now, by law, be paid to foreigners in our fisheries,
and, no doubt, is actually paid to them, for they
are obtained cheaper than oui own citizens But
it is sufficient for the argument that it may be paid
to them That shows that it is no part of the
policy of the act to foster American seamen I
thank the Senator from Massachusetts for pro-
nouncing that word foreigner, it reminds me of
my best argument And now, granting the fact
that there is a great increase of toreigners in our
commercial and naval marine—that we are em-
ploying seamen from foieign climes, who cannot
even speak our language, grant all this, and what
is it but the counteipait—the paiallelism—to our
late importation of wheat fiom the iiosphorous
and the Vistula' What is it buf the same thing
in another form of our late importation from Eu-
rope, of hay, oats, buttei, eggs, beef, pork, bacon,
lard, tallow, bailey, rye, and othei necessaries of
life' What is it all but the eflect of our paper
system—the effect of our nine hundred banks,
which are to be one thousand before this year is
out, all lisumg currency, and all going on swell-
ing and expanding, and raising the price of all
articles until they reach the bursting point' Our
paper system has brought these foreign mari-
néis into our service by giving them so much
higher wages than they can get at home It has
brought, also, the foreign ships, which now get
so large a share of our carrying trade , it has put
up the wages of the mariners to the high rates
which the ¡senator from Massachusetts mentions,
and high as those rates are, he may expect to see
them higher before they are lower, for the cause
which raises prices is now in full and growing
force, the paper balloon is now rising and distend-
ing It will continue rising and distending until
it bursts again, and with its ascent and distension
will go up the prices of all articles—manners'
wages and ship freights inclusive
The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr Davis]
speaks of the depressed state of the fisheries—their
small product—the little profit attending them, &c ,
and on this account claims a continuance of the
allowances I deny that these considerations, ad-
mitting them to be well founded in point of fact,
could have any weight in the decision of this ques-
tion. It is an argument which may be used, at
times, in favor of every possible trade, pursuit, or
occupation. It may be used, at times, in favor of
any branch of agriculture, manufactures, naviga-
tion, or commerce, and if Congress is to help out
any one branch of business with bounties when it
is madepressed and unprofitablestate, it may pre-
pare itself to help out all, and, in the end to be-
come the insurer of all undertakings and the m-
demnifier of all losses But, sir, are the fisheries
in this depressed state> are they really at the low-
ebb, and profitless point, at which the Senator
from Massachusetts would present them> Is this
their actual condition? Let facts answer; and
above all, let the Massachusetts General Assem-
bly answer. Look to the report on the manufac-
tures of that State for the year ending the 31st of
March, 1837, just published by order of the Le-
gislature, and by which the product of the fisher-
ies alone for that State, refined whale oil included,
is returned at near $10,000,000'—to be precise,
$9,822,611. Why, sir, this is near double the
amount of the whole export of tobacco from the
entire United States ' It is nearly four times the
amount of the whole exported rice crop of the
South ' It is more than the total export of beef,
pork, bacon, laid, hides, tallow, live stock, flour,
corn, cornmeal, all put together, from all parts of
the United States, amounted to for the same year'
No, Mr President, the fisheries are doing very
well, and there is another way to prove it Com-
pare, for example, the number of persons em-
ployed in the business, with the product of their
labor, and see how the account will stand Look-
ing, then, to that same report from the Massachu-
setts Legislature, Í see that the number of persons
engaged in her fibheries, refining whale oil inclu-
sive, is two thousand one hundred and seventy.
Now divide the proceeds of the fisheries among
this number, and it is close upon $500 a year to
each person engaged in the business ' the fishing
year, except for whales, being three months and
a half Five hundred dollars for three and a
half months, and that without counting the allow-
ance which they get from the Government. This
is one view to prove the prosperous state of these
fisheues, and a very conclusive one it is, but it is
not the only view to that effect, nor even the most
conclusive one Another view results from a com-
parison of the capital invested in the business, and
the annual amount of its product, the year for the
cod and mackerel fishing being three and a half
months. This capital, for Massachusetts, as seen
in the report which I have mentioned, amounts to
no more than $13,617,578, so that the product of
the business for the season is only about one third
below the amount of the capital invested It is
actually neai sixty-six and two third per cent on
the amount of the capital employed No, these
fisheries are not at a low ebb, nor is their state
dependent upon the bounties and premiums from
the Government Though a large amount to issue
from the Treasury, they are but a small item in
the value of the fisheries. This value in Masschu-
setts alone amounts to about $10,000,000 per an-
num Ido not know the product of the other New-
England States, but I do know that they all have
a protection and encouragement, under our laws,
such as no other branch of industry receives, and
compared to which the bounties and allowances are
nothing They have a monopoly of the home
market, and a good share in the foreign market
They have the exclusivl supply of our own six-
teen millions of people with the produce of the
fisheries, and they export largely besides Thio
I proved a few days ago, when I showed, from
the tables of Imports and exports of these articles,
that the 'mport offish, formerly large, is now re-
duced to nothing, the export, formerly inconsider-
able, is now large All this was proved, and this
is the real encouragement and protection to the
fisheries, this monopoly of the home supply, and
this share in the foreign trade, this it is that puta
up the product of the business to $500 a hand for
three months and half. And now what other
branch of industry has the same protection, or the
same profit' What other branch of business has
the monopoly of the market of the whole Union '
Has anyone' No, not one' Not even bread;
for we buy bread often from abroad Our farmers
are often deprived of our own flour market, by
importations of wheat from the Vistula and Black
sea, and yet they have no bounties and allowances
They have no drawbacks of duties paid They
have not even salt free of tax '
Several Senators object to taking up the subject
singly, they object to proceeding on the salt duty
alone, andtheydemand, why notjoin otherarticle3
with it, or wait for a general adjustment of the end
of the so called compromise in 1842 I will give
these Senators my reasons for proceeding sepa-
rately on this article, and I will give them a dozen
different reasons, eithei of which will be sufficient
to justify my proceedings- 1 Salt is now, at thia
