schooner under the circumstances, at a point in the James River far above our lines and gun-boats, I consider worthy the notice of the commanding general.

I remain, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding Eighteenth Corps.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff to Major-General Butler.

Numbers 46. Report of Surg. George Suckley, U. S. Army, Medical Director, of operations May 6-16.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Cobb's Hill, Va., May 20, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor herein to furnish you a report of the killed and wounded of this corps that have come under my cognizance and general care since the corps landed at Bermuda Hundred, on the 6th day of May, 1864, to and including the casualties of the 16th instant:

A few men, comparatively, may have been treated at their regimental camps, or sent away on transports to Fort Monroe that 1 have had no official knowledge of, and who are not reported here, some of whom were killed outright on the battle-fields and either left with the enemy or instantly buried, I also cannot report for want of data, and the killed and wounded who have fallen in the hands of the enemy, especially during the battle of May 16, can only be accounted for in the general reports of their division commanders as among the missing. I learn from the rebel newspapers that 24 of our wounded fell into their hands during the engagement of the 7th instant, who were sent to their hospital at Petersburg, and I personally know of 7 dead left in the hands of the enemy on the same day. During the various engagements a moderate number of rebel wounded were captured. They were attended to fully as well as were our own men, and everything, so far as I know, that could be dictated by humanity or the countess of war was done for them.
