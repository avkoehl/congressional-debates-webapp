DUBLIN, July 7, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,

Lewisburg:

Have your infantry, with the exception of [G. M.] Edgar's battalion, ready to move as soon as practicable. All regimental and battalion, with the proper proportion of brigade transportation, to accompany troops. The troops will take with them rations for seven days, and all the ammunition.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Colonel W. L. JACKSON

(Care Brigadier-General Echols), Lewisburg:

I have heard nothing of the success of your move on Beverly. If you have fallen back from that place, and the enemy in your front is not in force to indicate a raid on a larger scale than you can prevent, order Dunn's battalion to Lewisburg, to report to the officer commanding at that place.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

DUBLIN, July 7, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Your telegram of yesterday received. Eleven hundred infantry can start by railroad for either point you mention at any moment the transportation can be furnished. The other troops required to make up the number you mention are from three to four days' march from the railroad. To move them back to the railroad, and hold the there awaiting orders, would for that time only expose the country they are now guarding. Shall I draw them back to the railroad? It is not practicable so to post my troops as to be equally ready for prompt movement either to Northwestern Virginia or one of the two other points you mention. May I solicit early action on my letter of the 5th instant to General Cooper, recommending the promotions of Colonels Wharton and McCausland to the grade of brigadier-generals? I am very anxious that they shall have the rank before my troops move. I am so well satisfied with them that, it they cannot be promoted, I would rather they should remain in command of brigades as colonels than to have them superseded by other brigadiers.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

It has been reported to the general commanding that many persons have been through the country seizing horses without authority, and in many instances paying nothing for them. He directs me to say that he wishes you to cause a thorough inspection to be made in your command, and all horses that may be found in the possession of men not entitled to be mounted to be turned into the quarter-
