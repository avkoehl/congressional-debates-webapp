miuue ol* the Whole on the state of the Union have
had under consideuition the suite of the Union
generally, and particularly the hill of this House,
entitled*" A bill reducing the duty on imports,
and for other purposes," and have directed me to

ments.
Tiie SPEAKER.. Gentlemen, the chairman of
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union reports that the committee have had under
consideuiiion the Male of the Union geneuilly, and
parti* ularly the hill of this House, entitled " A bill
reducing the duty on imports, and for other pur-
poses," and have directed him to report the same
to the House, with various amendments.
The question is on concurring in the amend-
ments, and on ordering the bill to be engrossed for
a third reading.
Mr. TJOYI) demanded the previous question.
Mr.liRODIi EADmo\ed that the hill and amend-
ments he laid on the table, and asked the yeas and
nay* on that motion; winch weic ordered.
Mr. STARKWEATHER inquiied of the Chair
whether, if the hill should be hud on the table, it
could be taken up at any time by a majority vote? j|
The SPEAKER would decide that question, he jj
>$uid, when it properly came up. !
Mr. 01 IAPMAN, of Maryland, asked to be 1
excused fiom voting on the bill, and said that, at j
the request of Ins colleague, [Mr. Ligon,] who i
had been sent for on account of the illness of his I
family, he had paired olf with hnn. It was well j
know n thai he (Mr. C.) was opposed to the bill of
the committee, and his colleague was in favor of !
it, as declared to him and their other colleagues, !
n« well as to the chairman of the committee, [Mr. [
i\IcK,vv;j and under the circumstances whiehcalled j
his colleague away, or would have subjected him j
to most painful uncertainty, if he had remained, he |
could not refuse the request which lie himself would ;
expect would be granted under like circumstances.
He therefore could not vote on the bill.
Mr. C. was excused.
The question, "Shall this bill he hud on the ta-
ble*" was then taken, and resulted as follows:

So the bill was not laid on the table. i
And the question recurring on the demand for |
the previous question, there was a second. <
And the mam question (first on the amendments, j
and secondly on ordering the bill to a third read- \
insO was ordered to be now taken. !
The amendments were acted on in their order,
and such as are not herein particularly designated,
were concurred in, or disposed of, without a record
vote. The others were reserved for a separate vote.
On concurring with the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union in its amendment striking
out from schedule D, (which imposes a twenty per
cent, duty,) the article of " salt."
Mr. P. KINO and Mr. BARRINGER asked
the yeas and nays, which were ordered, and, being
taken, resulted as follows:

So the House concurred with the committee in
striking- out the article.
Mr. HOUGH moved a reconsideration of the
vote.
Mr. GENTRY said he took it for granted that
the gentleman had voted with the majority.
The Cleik stated through the Chair, that the
gentleman had voted in the negative, and conse-
quently with the minority.
The SPEAKER said the gentleman under that
state of facts could not make the motion to recon-
sider.
Mr. PHELPS, who had voted with the majority,
now rose and moved a reconsideration of the said
vote.
Mr. HUDSON called for the enforcement of the
rule preventing members from being around the
Clerk's desk when the vote was taken.
[There were several gentlemen standing or sit-
ting in front of the table.]
The SPEAKER called to order, and stating that
this practice was not authorized by the rule, caus-
ed to he read the rule itself, as follows:
'•No member or other pei-on shall vi«it, or remain by the
Clerk's table while Hie ayes and noes are calling, or ballots
are counting."
Mr. HUDSON again called for, and insisted
upon, the enforcement of the rule.
Mr. PAYNE wanted to make an inquiry. I '<
want to know, (said he, looking in the direction of \\
Mr. Hudson,) whether it is proper for any man i!
who is himself interested in dollars and cents to ''
vote upon this proposition ? That is what I want
to know, sir.
The question was then taken, and the vote re-
sulted as follows:
YftA^—Stephen Adams, Atkniron, Bayly, Bed-

So the House refused to reconsider.
The next question was on inserting " salt" on
the list of free articles.
The yeas and nays were asked and ordered, and
the YOte having been taken,
The SPEAKER announced the result to be—
yeas 105, nays 104.
There is a rule of the House in the following
words:
" In all cases of election by the House the Speaker shall
vote; in othei cases he shall not vote, unless the House be
equally divided, or unless his vote, if given to the minority,
will make the division equal; and in case of such equal di-
vision, the question shall be lost."
Mr. BAYLY now called^on the Speaker to vote.
The SPEAKER. If the Speaker is called upon
to vote, he votes in the negative.
The vote, therefore, stands—yeas 105, nays 105.
So the amendment is rejected.
There was some applause, which the Speaker
instantly checked.
Mr. JAMES THOMPSON rose to a point of
order. He desired to know whether the Speaker
could vote, inasmuch as he had announced the
result.
The SPEAKER said, that at the moment he did
so, he was not aware of the exact state of the vote.
Mr. JENKINS moved a reconsideration of the
vote, and asked the yeas and nays; which were
ordered.
And the Clerk having called the roll,
The SPEAKER said: The same error has been
fallen into tj^at occurred on a formerofceasion where
the Speaker was called on to give the casting vote.
It is due to the Clerk that the matter should be
more carefully investigated, in order to ascertain
whether the Speaker is entitled to vote or not. One
of the assistant clerks had looketl over the roll
since the annunciation of the vote, and found the
result to be different from that declared by the
Chair. If gentlemen will be good enough to come
to order, the noise and confusion which pervade
the Hall, and render the transaction of business so
difficult, will be avoided.
Air. BAYLY asked that the list of names might
again be called over.
This was not done; but the Clerk proceeded to
count the roll.
Mr. TIBBATTS desired to change his vote.
The SPEAKER said he would now state what
the fact, as to the vote, was. The Chair was of
opinion that no member would now be entitled to
vote on the motion to add salt to the free list.
The true state of that vote was as follows:
