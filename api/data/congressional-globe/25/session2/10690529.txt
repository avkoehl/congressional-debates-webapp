acts passed, considering that the wnole fund anting horn the
pioceeds of public land  m those States were applicable to the
construction oí a mod from Wheeling to the Mississippi river,
orí the 15th day of May, 18¿0, passed a. law luthorizing the Pie
dent to have a 10a 1 laid out fiom Wheeling to a point on the
Mississippi river between St Loins and the mouth of the Jlli
nois river In the preamble ot this last act it is exprtssly de
clared that the continuation of the Cumbei land ro td through the
States of On o, Indiana, and Illinois will make the lands of the
United States more valuable
On the second day of March, 18d9, Congiess passed two acts
foi the continuation of the Cumbeiland road westwardly of
Zwesville, in the Sute of Oh o, and appropriated $100 00U foi
Ohio, and $30 000 for the road in Indiana, according to the ioca
tion which had been made, out oí any money m the Treasuiy
not otherwise appropriated, which sums these acts provided
are tobe leplacedout oí the funds lescrved lor roads by the
several acts bcfoie íeferred to passed fur the admission of
Ohio,Indiana, Illinois, aid Missouu into the Union A sunt
lar appropriation was afterwtids made fur continuing the
road m the State oi IHmoi--, and nuaieiouo appropria
tions have been made horn time to time foi more than
thuty years for this road, without regard to the amount re
received out of the pioeecds of public land* «o d in the lour
States pf Ohio, Ind xna, Illin us and Mis^o in Gon^r^s hag
justly deemed the fund reseivedm the compact w th each State
an entne thing, an i applied de to tiie eonsuuetum of tlie road
from Wheeling to ti e Mus ^ip,)i n\ er, and have acted m ac
cordance wi h that view This Government, to ha-u°n the'•ule
and add to the value oi tl eir pub u land1-, have, by then action,
insured tli" people of the United & ite  that th^v have not Only
provided a fund foi so'ioob-,, but a good load foi tiien u= e, and to
enable them to revisit then friends and íelations fiom whom
they may have separated by removal to the Wesurn states
New settleis were assuied mat as ipulatioo h al beta cxai ted
from the new states that now purchasers and sett lets should ot
free for five yeais from the common burden of taxation, and
that this load would be made without waiting ior the íeceipí oí
the fund reserved Ihe new states, conn" ling m the implied
assurances of the Government, have made tiieir local imp i ove
ments to a great extent in lelerence to aid in accordance with
tins great national work In addition to all this , Congies1-, by
an act approved on the 2 i of IWLich, 1S31, agreed to stuiender

States and for allneighboihooilpuiposes it is a free load as
well as for the mails and military pm poses of the Imueu States
and States The intent, substance, and object ol tin's act, on
die part of Ohio, was to take caieol ibis innl, preseive and
repair it, fiee iiom any charge to th =i Government after it
shall be completed She agrees to chaige no tol s more than
nece^ary to pay expenses and keep it m lepair, and to give to
the National Government a Faiae expenditure foi mails and

I appeal to ever} candid man to anbwei whedu r, acendn c to
the tiue intent and spirit of this arrangement between Ohio
and this Government, it doe*, not i leauv appear th it'he Unite 1
States are to complete the road and Ohio to pie<u rve arj keep
it in repair on the terms specified in hei lav, and wouid it com
poit with the honor, pis tee, o chai icter of this high and
magnanimous nation to ietieat nora hei engagement, on the
giound that she haa not literally coveramtl to compl te V- e
roadt It was never expecfel, noi wa it in the contemplation
of the parties, thaf the Sutes were to make the road, bat b >th

the object anl e sence if the compact We shou d beai in
mind, [said Mi Topc 1 that, *n 'ependent of the neneñtsderived
by this Government fiom the speedy sile of then Uo1  it an

Toads to companies and States, probably seveial million  of
dollar" for, although fiist pi id by contracto  o, it is mduectJy
diawn fiom the pockets of the people
I have understood (said Mi Pope) that the mail contiarmrs
on the road from Maysville to Lexmaton, Kentucky,(sixty five
milp'V pay from five to eight thousand dollars a year li
a daily mail should be run from Louisville to Spnngfield,
in Kentucky, a distance o! forty si\ miles, the road tolls
would amount t-> near three thousand dollars a year I have
no data (said Mi Pops) to enable meto malee a precise esti
mate of the cost of carrying the mails flora this to St Louis,
a distance of frem eight hundred to one thousand mile" The
lapid increase of letteis and packages to be transmitted by
mail, with the amount necessary to be deposited on the road for
distribution towards the Ohio river and to the lakes from this
Cumberland road, will probably soon requue several coaches,
and, if run daily fiom this city to St Louis, would cost this na-
tion, u not run free,, according to the compact with Ohio, fiom
fifty to one hundred thousand dollars a yeai, exclusive of the
expense of the military action of this Government, and th ^ ex
pense would baa perpetuil annual tax on the nation We
ceitainly ought to havesome good national roads fiom the seat
of Government to our Western and othet borders of our terri-
tmes, payable at all seasons of the year Our Western and
•southwestern nveis are often obstructed by ice, and occasion
ally loo low to be ascended to Wheeling or Pittsburgh, when,
by a cncuitous loute, die people weit of the mountains may
íeachheie by tnis load If we hate not been able to obtain a
good load to Kentucky and the Southwest, let us not, on that
iccount, anest tins w nk, which will be, in some degree, ad
vantageotn to the whoh West This load completed, it<? bene
fits will be so obvious laat Congiesi may be induced to make
othets tnoie convenient to us and othei pontons of the Union,
whenevei tin c mdition of oui finances will aathonze such et

Mr Speikei (.said Mr Popl,) it may not be amiss to reiro
spect the period and then state ol public opinion when this
work was commenced In 1S02 tin in&t compact was made
with Ohio ibout this i nd, but nothing was done until 1806,
when Congievi,app!OpriatedS30000 to liy out and make this
road from the Potorn ic to the Ohio nver, and, in 1810, $60,000
was appropriated to comnn nee the work, out of any money m
the Treasuiy but chiigeable on the two per cent fund, and to
bcrennbiu>ed vvh°n ieceued fiom that tund Nothing had
been done fiom 1802 to l^Ob, and the two pel cent fund then re
ceived was veiy inadequate to this Teat woik, and the Adrnj
nistiition, with Mi Jetiu on at its head, were promp<ed by
hi° i f I'lticat * m^idei ttions to begin th" load, and to complete

About that period, or shmtly before, we had made a large
addition 10 the Uuited States by the purchase of Louisiana,
which wa> opposed on constitutional giound, and because it
would destioy the relative influence of other sections of the
Union m the Confedt lat on, and because it -would, from its
gr^at extent, end mger the peimanency of the Union Mr
Teffei'-.on had cois itutiond objections, but believed i hat the

that quarter have no duect or practicable route to this place m
a bad season of the year, and especially when the Irivers aie

road from this place, through Maryland and Pennsylvania, to
the lakes, to which I see no en ong objection Thm Government
ought to nave the means of convey nig intelligence to all parts of
the Union at all seasons of the year
Mr Speaker, {said Mr Pope,] steamboats and railroads an
swer very well for many purposes,--and railroads are useful
for short distances, and between cities not very distant from
each other, where there is great and constant commercial in er
course^but they arfe not suited to the agricultural people of the
mtenoraswell as Macadamised road*, on which every person
can travel on foot, on his pony, in cart, wagon, dearborn or car
riage, as fast or as slow as suits his inclination or convenience
I like a road on which every one can carry his own productions
to market I take little pleasu'em being whizzed through the
country with the speed of a humming bird without time even
to get a dnnk of water on the wiy Indeed T think our public
men would do better and learn moie of ihe goo 1 sen^e and pub

plain,indusirious <iiiú fuming elm esof the nation, who aie

can system If 1 understand the motion of my colleague, [Mr
Umdeuwood ] it is toiecommit the bif! and cede the roid to
the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois 'IheseS'ates would
not thank us ioi the cession Indiana and Illinois certainly
would not, as there is little, if am part of the done m either of
those States Ohio might be willing to accept a cession, pio-
vided we would lepeal the act of 1831 by which she agreed to
make the tolls low and the mad fiee "  the United Slates If
that law is repelled and the cession made unconditionally,
Ohm might con-eni, because she could then impose a high tol!
on the United States mail and everv citizen of the United States,
and derive a considerable revenue fiom the tolls on (he road
finished in that State It wouldseem to be moie open'ard fair
for my colleague to withdraw his motion and meet the ques
