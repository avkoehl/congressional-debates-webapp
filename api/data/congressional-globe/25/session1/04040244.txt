do nothing hut consecrate and forttfy the " plain
ruLs of aiieie it liberty," hande 1 down w ith Magna
Chai te Irum the ear íest historv of our race it is
nota piece of paper, sir, tt is not a few abstractions
engrossed on parchment, that make five Govern-
ments. No, sir, the law of lioerty must be in-
scribed on the heart of the citizen , the word, if I
may use the expression without irreverence, must
become flesh, you must have a while people
trained, disciplined, bred, vea, and born, as our
fathers were, to institutions like ours Before the
colonies existed, the petition ot right, tint Ma<*ni
Charta, of a more enlightened age, had been pre-
sented m 1628 by Lord Co' e and his immortal
compeers. Our founders brought it with them,
and we have not gone one step be) ond them They
brought these maxims of civil libem, not in their
libraries, but in the<r souls, not as philosophical
prattle—not as barren generalities, but as rules of
of conduct, as a symbol oí public duty and puvate
right, to be adhered to wiih religious fidelity , and
the very fitst pilgrim that <ie set his foot upon the
lock of Plymouth, stepped foith ? living constitu-
tion ' armed at all points, to defend and to perpetu-
ate the liberty to which he had devoted his whole
be mg.
It only remains for me lo advert briefly to one or
two additional topics, and 1 have doue It has
been argued as if the currency given to bank paper
In this ci untry, were due almost exclus vely to the
countenance which government affords it, by re-
ceiving U in payment of public dues Certainly,
sir, the pationage of Government is an impoitaiH
concurring cause of this credit, but it is not tine
that it is essential to it What does the house of
Rothchild owe to the Government of Europe—
that house to which all the Governments on the
continent are obliged to have recourse in their
financial exigencies ^ And here let me (ill the at-
tention ofthos  who declaim ->o vehemently lgainst
the agenc) of banking cotporalions, to the tact, that
this mighty house, with its scarcely less than rojal
influence and splendor, like most of the other estab-
lishments of the same kind in Europe, is no corpor-
ation at all, but a mere private partneiship, and to
the additional tact, that this collossal fortune has
been amassed m little more than a single genera-
aitón, by an obscure person, bom in a corner of the
Juden-Strasse ol Frankfort on the Mame, and his
four sons Do you not see, then, sir, that the odious
common places about " the money power," and
the political powers," either tuve no meaning or
apply with al' their Arce to even' accumulation
ol capitel, and all the great íesulis ci modem com-
merce? The "money power," I presume, signi-
fies "the power of mone>," wheh is widely dif-
fused in this country, thanks to the protection uf
equal laws, and which will exist and continue to
have it  influence, so long as tho e laws shall pro-
tect it from confiscation, whether it shall borrow the
credit of the Government, or the Government shall
borrow its credit It is scarcely i ecessary to notic 
an idea, analogous to the last, w hich his been v erv
much insisted on, and tint is, that the commerce of
New York has been built up by Government
credit . Whj, sir, this does appear to me too ex-
travagant to need exposure New York has been
bntlt up bv her unquestionable natural advantages,
and there is no measure of this Government—there
is only one event that can possibly deprive her of
immense commercial ascendanc) ,—the dissolution
ol the Union—that, and nothing but that, can do it
Commeice, as I have already remarked, leads every
where to centralization look at Liverpool—look at
Havre, the last, m a hard money countn But on
this-head there is a very ltnpoitant consideration,
which has been urged with all.his admirable elo-
quence, by one of mj colleagues m the Senate,
(Mr Preston ) If this concentration oí commer-
cial business at that city be injurious to the others
now,whatw ill it become, if, by c 1'ecting the revenue
m gold and silver, and thus making go'd ind silver
mere merchandise, you add to the dis-idvan ages
of centralization, all the difficulties of proeuung
com—make New York the great sp"cie market—
and render the whole country tributary to the
money changer  of Wall street ?
Sir, a word more to the south, ard for the south
When your system of protection was still in all Us
v   ir wc,(I nean the  people of South Carolina,)
sent y ou a protest  against its  principles  and ten-
dene), which contained, among other objections to
jt, one that dcseives to be repeated here     We told
yon that w e depended absolutely upon commerce—
commerce on the 1 >rgest scale—commerce carried
on is it has been for the last half century, with an
ever increasing production, provoking and creating
an ever mcrea«ing consumption, and permitting us
to  send  a million  (now a million and a half) of
bales of cotton into the market, without any dangei
of a glut    We told you the  staple commodities,
especially the principal one which we produced,
were among the very few in the production of
which slave labor can enter into competition with
free    AVe re irmded ) ou  that great revolutions m
tríele    sometimes   aiose   from   appaiently  «light
causes, and that however far it might he from your
purpose, or even your apprehensions, it was possi-
ble that yout legislation might occasion us the loss
of our foreign market, our only resource—that the
result of that loss to us would be poverty and utter
desolation , that our people in despair would emi-
grate to more fortunate regions, and the vvh >le
frame and constitution  of our society would be
seriously impaiied and endangered, if not dissolved
entirely    And we adjured you not to persist tn a
course of legislation of which the benefit to your-
selves, ev en were they unquestionable, were nothing
m comparison of the danger to which they exposed
us—a dangei which, how ever contingent or remóle,
involved  our  whole  existence, and  could not be
contemplated without well founded alaim     Sir, I
repeat to jou now—I repeat t) the lepresentatives
of the whole south  on   this floor—the  words then
addressed lo the house on a different subject     Let
well alone    Resist this uncalled for innovation, of
which no one can foresee the  whole extent nor the
ultimate íesults    Mark what your Secretary of the
Tnisurj histoid vouinthe very   papei in >vhich
he reveals the pioject on  the   table—vol produce
aoo  Alien  coiia\     Go home, gentlemen of the
south, and tell your people that their successful in-
dustry is a vice—that the fertility of their soil is a
curse—that their excessive production  occasions
disorders m the stats—and that the remedy for our
troubles, is that they should live on short commons
Let them co-opeiate with our political economy,
by depriving themselves of the little mercantile
capital they have—let them abolish those corpora-
tions to which people, who cannot themselves do
business with the widow and the orphan, have con-
tributed  then  means for the accommodation  of
commerce—let ihcm but do this, and their docility
will be admirable and shall have our approbation
Sir, before I take my seat, thete is one othei
topic that I feel it my duty to advert to—I mean
to the supposed injurious effects of bulking insti-
tutions upon the laboring classes of society.    Al-
though I have no doubt but that theie are many
defects in the constitution, as well as the manage
ment  of those institutions in this  country, and
should be most willing to  co-operate   if occasii n
seived, m reforming them, I have no hesitation m
acquitting them al least of tins charge     Who that
has evei heard of the relation between capital and
labor bet teen wages and profits, but must see at
once tint it is unfounded, and.accorlinsrly, Hume
objects to banks that, by  their issues,  they raise
wages, and so hurt ihe manufacturing interests of
a nation     I have al-eady remarked, that one of
the effects of an increasing cunency is  to make a
distribution of the wealth of society more favora-
ble to the mdustiious classes of it—1> confiscate
in a manner, the piopeity of those vho live on'
fixed incomes, for the benefit of those who producp
the commodities on which those incomes are laid
out     It is for this reason that the radicals of Eng-
land—rvlr Atw ood, for example—are atl strenuous
aetv-i cates of paper money, and even of inconver-
tible pipei      Too dea that u,e poor are to gam by
a return to a metallic currency, is, so far as I know,
confiaed U the.r fneads in this country, wnose zeal
is ceita.nl/  greater t! an their know'edge    It is
true, sir, that among other disadvantages attending
frequent fluctuations in the cuixency, it is said thai
wages are the last thing that rises in a case of ex-
pansion     And that may be so m countries where
the supply of labor is greater than the demand, but
the very reverse is most certainly the fact here,
where the demand—especially when stimulated by
any ennordinaiy increase, real oi fictilious, of
capital—is always greater than the supply All
price is a question of puue>, or relative necessity
between two parties , and every body knows that,
in a period of excitement here, wages rise immedi-
ately, and out of all proportion more than any
thing else, because the population of tne country is
entire'y inadequate to its wants During the last
year for instance, the price of laboi became so
exorbitant, that come ot the most fertile land in
South Carolina, nee fie'ds, which have been culti-
vated for a hundred years, were in danger of being
abandoned from the impossibility of paying for it.
Sir, as a southern man, I represent equal'y rent,
capital, and wages, which are all confounded in
oui estates , and I protest against attempts to airay,
without cause, without a color of pretexi or plausi-
bility, the different classes of society against one
another, as it in such a countiy as this there could
be any natural hostility, or any real distinction be-
tween them—a country in which all tne rich, with
hardly an exception, hav e been poor, and all the
poor may be rich—a country in which banking in-
stitutions have been of immense service, precisely
because they have been most needed b) a people
who had all their fortune* to make bv good char-
acter and industrious habits Look at that re-
markable picture—remarkable not as a work of
art, but as a monument of historv—which you see in
passing through the Rotundo Two out of five of
that immortal committee weie mechanics, and such
men'* In the name of God, sir, whv should any
one study to pervert the natural gcod sense, and
kindly feelings of l! is moral ind noble people—to
míuse ín'o their minds a sullen envy towards one
another, instead of that generous emulation which
evcrv thing in their situation is fitted to inspire—to
bre ithe into them ihe sp i it of Cam, nutteung deep
curses ind mpcliMlin™ desplate levente againsthis
brother, because th  smokp of his sacrifice has as-
cended to Heaven before his own' And do not they
who treat our industrious cl isses as if they were m
the same debased, wrelched condition as the pool
of Europe, insult them by such an odious compari-
son 1 Why, sir, 5 ou do not know w hat poverty is 1
We have no pool in thiscountry, in the sense m vv bien
that word is used abroad Every laborer, even the
most humble, m the United States, soon becomes
a capitalist, and even, if he choose, a proprietor
