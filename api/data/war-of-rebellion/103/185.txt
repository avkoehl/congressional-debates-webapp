one mile from Spanish Fort. The command remained in this position until 6 p.m., when I received orders to send to the front 200 men as skirmishers, which were sent from the Twenty-third Wisconsin Volunteers, and deployed on the left of the skirmish line of the First Brigade. Five companies of the Twenty-ninth Illinois Veteran Volunteers were soon after sent out to the right of the First Division line of skirmishers, and the One hundred and sixty-first New York Volunteers was sent to the front to relieve the Ninety-ninth Illinois Volunteers, of the First Brigade, which was supporting the skirmish line. These dispositions being made, no charge took place until the following morning, when an advance on the works of Spanish Fort was ordered. I collected my scattered command and formed in line on the left of the First Brigade, my left resting near Wadsworth's house. A line of skirmishers was deployed in front and moved forward from this position, wheeling to the right, and at 12 m. the brigade was in a position 1,200 yards from Spanish Fort. The brigade remained in this position until the 28th, when I advanced the line 200 yards and had works constructed in front. I remained in this last position until the 30th of March. The brigade did a great deal of duty as skirmishers and fatigue duty in the rifle-pits before Spanish Fort. The loss was 4 killed and 22 wounded.

HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., 13TH ARMY CORPS,Mobile, Ala., April 13, 1865.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations and losses of the Third Brigade, First Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, in the siege of Blakely:

On the morning of the 3rd of April, after marching from Holyoke, I was ordered to place the Third Brigade in position on the left of a line to be occupied by the First Division, my left to extend to Minette Bay. I deployed skirmishers to examine the ground in the vicinity of the rebel works in front of the position I was ordered to occupy. Before the command was placed in position the order to move to the front was countermanded, and I was ordered to move to the rear and bivouac as a reserve, which I accordingly did near and east of Sibley's house, and remained in this position until April 5, at 9 p.m., when the brigade in light marching order moved around to the extreme right of the line investing the rebel works, to support Brigadier-General Hawkins' division. I was ordered back to camp near Sibley's house at daylight of the following morning. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th of April the entire command was on fatigue duty in the trenches and skirmish duty. On the 9th I was ordered to move my command to the front and take up a position in rear of the Second Brigade, First Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, to support it in the charge which was to be made by our troops, and which was made at 6 p.m., resulting in the capture of the rebel works. The Third Brigade lost 2 killed and 6 wounded at Blakely.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. KINSEY,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Captain R. G. CURTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
