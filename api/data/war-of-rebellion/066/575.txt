Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

John's Island, via Fort Pemberton:

The enemy has not landed any troops either on James or John's Island from their transports since daylight. May have landed troops during the night on John's Island. The enemy are at J. Grimball's, and Sol. Legare's, on the river. Ascertain, if possible, if they are erecting any batteries at Saxby's or J. A. Fripp's.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 9, 1864-6.30 p .m.

Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Commanding, John's Island, via Fort Pemberton:

Your two telegrams of 1 clock's to-day received. Do not attack, but take strong position, and do your utmost to prevent enemy from advancing. Their object is to establish batteries in position to take in reverse or enfilade our works on James Island. Your especial duty now is to prevent them from doing that. If you accomplish that, it is all I can expect at present. Take care of your men--that is, do not throw them rashly against the enemy. Put them in good position to keep the enemy back. If they intended general advance, your attack this morning will make them pause.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

His Excellency Governor M. L. BONHAM,

Columbia, S. C.:

Your telegram received after 12 o'clock last night. Would like to have the cadets from Columbia; also De Saussure's brigade, if there are any men in it. I want them chiefly for guard duty in and about the city. The enemy has left John's Island, except a few apparently near Legareville. They seem just now to be concentrating on James Island and Morris Island. Gun-boats still in the StoNumbers They may be preparing to attack some other point of the works about Charleston.
