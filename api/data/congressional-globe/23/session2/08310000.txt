this time Sjch opimciis^from so respectable a ¡
source, are calculated to moke an eironeous im-
press! m both at home and abroad The gentle-
man has furnished us with a statistical table of
the number of ships of war of each class belonging
to the Fiench navy The naval power of anation
is not, sir, to be measu'ed by the number of its
vessels of war—it is a fallacious standard. It must
be measured by the foundation on which naval
power rests, the extent and character of its corn-
mere al marine No nation possesses so powerful
and effective a commercial marine as the United
States, animated and invigorated, as it is, by the
spirit of freedom
The gentleman from Virginia may deceive him-
self, but France knows our naval strength, and
England too, and if our national rights are main-
tained here, as they ought to be, in a spirit corre-
spondms with the extent of our naval resources,
neither France nor England will ever be willing
to engage in a war with us     But according to
the  argunnent of tne gentleman, we are to be
overwhelmed with some thirty or forty ships of
the line     Sir, the ten thousand manners whom
we have now engaged in the whale trade—that
" dreadful trade "—are alone sufficient to sweep
from the ocean the whole naval power of France.
O ir mariners employed in  the fisheries on our
coast ai d on the banits, are able of themselves to
contend successfully with any na\al power ex-
isting     The naval resources of France may be
great in °h ps and 11 het gallant officers—whose
daring b-aveiy no nation will dispute—but ships
and  (friceis are powerless without a well disci-
plined and extensive commeicial marine, and na-
tions the most commercial must ever be the most
poaeiful on the ocean   In a war with us, France
can denve no a d from her amy though it were
eiual to that formidable force which ciossed the
Niemen m 1812   The war, if there be one, will be
oa the ocean     We have the materials ready for
an immense navy—we have a commercial manne,
always ready to avenge our wrongs, and we could
tut  afloat in twelve months a naval force with
wh ch no na'ion could successfully contend    I do
not sav this, su, because 1 anticipate war with
France—Heaven  forbid  that the peace be'ween
the two nations should ever be disturbed—botn
nations have eveiy motive to cherish it, and I am
sure it ne\er will be sacrificed for five and twenty
mil'ions of francs     But, sir, the extraordinary
statements of the gentleman  from Vnginia has
compelled me to dissipate the unfounded appre
h nsi3ns   they   were  calculated   to  excite,  and
wh ch might do us an mjuiy abioad     We have
i oihmg to fear from any nation,come the contest
wn«=n it may
The gentleman from Virginia has referred to
tt-e opinions expressed by oui officers as to the
great superiority and discipline of the French
navy <U the present time Modesty, sir, is the
chaiactenstic of a brave man—our officers will
never underrate those who aie, oi those who may
I e, their antagonists But the opinions of our
officers can never sweep away our commercial
niarmt, and while we have that, we shall never
concede superiority to any naval power France
has, too.anotl ei powerful motue fe r not willingly
ei gijing m a v>ai with us It the shomd attempt
to intenupt the commeice betaeen this comí  y
and Gieat B nam, or to interfeie with British
vessels, tiadino- I etween the United States and any
pait of the world—if she should venture to tres-
pass on her neutrality, England would soon be a
party m the war
We mean, su, to have no war with Trance—
v e mean to avoid it, to do so effectually we must
meet the crisis feailessiy, and maintain our na
tioiial rights with dignity Adopt that as your rule
of condu t in your rehtions with foreign nations,
and you will command the rebpect of the world,
ami, toge-tl ei with oui isolated position avoid war
for a centui> to come    France, sir, will herself
20
respect us the more for maintaining onr rights
with spirit and firmness Gentlemen who enter-
tained a different opinion must pardon him for
totally dissenting from the policy adopted by the
Senate The persuasive tone is not the one which
will ever obtain indemnity from any nation The
tone of the message justly responded by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Adams,] is that
which has commanded the respect of France as it
ought to have done, and the applause of nations
Trance respects us because we respect ou. selves
For the first time the French Chamber is awakened
to the true character of the question Hitherto it
has been frittered away, trifled with, and lost
sight of, amidst the struggles for power among the
various parties in that body—they never looked
abroad Now it has become a great national
question, in which the honor and welfare of the
nation is involved, and the measure will no longer
be sacrificed to gratify the spirit of party If it
be defeated, it will be because both Houses did
not, at an early period of the session, respond to
the tone of the message, not by adopting meas
uies of reprisal at once, but by doing what we are
now about to do—exhibiting a firm determination
to sustain the rights and honor of the nation,
should the obligations of the treaty be not fulfilled
But, sit, I believe the appropriation wiH have
been, or will be made The composition of the
Chamber differs from this body and the House
of Commons The privilege of voting in Franee
is limited to one hundred and sixty thousand
voters, and the Deputies represent more fully the
commercial and manufacturing mteiests of France,
having a deep interest in the quesuon—it is essen
tially a body íepiesenting the c ties and towns of
Fiance Such repiesentatives will surely not
sacrifice the great interests of then constituents,
1 to gratify party revenge, and in a case where
France is clearly in the wrong Eat whatevei
Trance may do, let us do our duty, and without
desiring or anticipating the worst, let us be pre-
pared for it
I regret, sir, that I have been compelled to
engage in this debate, contrary to my wish and
design, for I anticipate, and sincerely dewre, noth-
ing but peace between the two great nation!, I
will now, sir,adopt,m the form of a resolutions
sentiment which I found this morning m the report
of the minority of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs. Had such a resolution been proposed
in the committee by either of the gentlemen who
signed mat document, it would have been, with
perhaps one exception, unanimously supported
We were alv ays ready to declare that" the treaty
of the 4 h of July, 1831, should be maintained,
and its execjtion insisted on at all hazards I
unite with them most cordially in the sentiment
and I hope the gentleman fiom Massachusetts will
accept it as a substitute for his The first and
third resolution will then be abandoned, and 1 [
trust that this lesoluuon, wuh the seconu, will be
adopted with unanimity                                            |
The resolution was then lead, and placed mtne
order of pioceedmgs, in lieu of the amendment ,
originally offered by Mr  Ad «is      It is as tot- |
°™>*Resolied, That in the opinion of this House
' the tieaty of the 4„h of July, 1831, should be
' maintained, and its execution insisted on, at all
' hazards "                                            ,.      ,,
I Mr ARCHER then said he would withdraw
his íesolution.and ado} t mat of his col'eague,
[Mi Pattuv,] if the gentleman fiom Massachu-
setts [Mr  Adims] would als) adopt it
I Mi ADAMS lephed, that he could not take the
couise indicated in the suggestion of the gentie
man from Vug ma He «as perfectly willing to
accept that of the cha man of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs as a subetuu e fur his ovin He
had the other day asked his colleague [Mi uv
erettI if his report concluded with resolutions,
aid, it he had received an affiimative answer to
this inquiry, it was not his intention to have offered
that which was now on the table He considered
the resolution now proposed for his adoption, by
the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
[Mr Cambrele\g,J as expressing all that was
expressed by his own, and a little more The
difference consisted m this, that his resolution
declared that the indemnity secured by the treaty
of 1831 should i  no cient be abandoned The
one he now adopted declared that it should be
secured at all hazards He was perfectly willing
to adopt that language
Mr BTJRGES contended that the Houseshould
do nothing which was calculated to throw em-
barrassment in the way of an amicable adjustment
of the question This House was on the eve of a
political dissolution Itcouiddo nothing efficient.
It might pass resolutions, but if war was neces-
sary, it did not possess the power, or could not at
this late period cany out such a measure Under
the circumstances, he thought the members of this
House should not throw any embarrassment in
the way of their successors He was pleased
with the last resolution of the gentleman from
New York, [Mr Cambrflekg,] in some respects.
It contained no threat, and every individual in the
land would insist upon having the treaty carried
into effect as it was, no person would submit to a
reduction of the sum, and it might with propriety
be insisted that it should be increased
Mr B was soi ry that the question of war had
been discussed upon this occasion He referred
to the mant me force and power of the two na-
tions, and the detriment to the commerce of the
United States which would result from such a
war He thought the House should be extremely
cautious in its action upon a question which might
result in war He adverted to the ground of dis-
pute with France It involved a question of
money only, and no case would be cited where a
Christian nation had gone to war merely for plun-
der He insisted that there was much more cause
for war on account of the bad faith and treatment
which had originated our claims against France,
than in a refusal to pay the sum of money which
was stipulated to be paid us He thought that,
after the United States passed over the insults of
France, we should be deeply and wgloriously
disgraced by going to war, merely because France
would not pay us a sum of money for accumulated
v rongs
Mr B entered, at some length, into a history
of ti e d fficu'ties with France, and contended that
there existed no just cause of war The present
aspect of the controversy seemed to him to be a
mere question of etiquette between the President,
and the Fiencn King, and the"Foreign Minister
of this Government, and the Minister of State of
Fiance                                                                     ,
In conclusion, Mr   B   said  the House might
pass any resolution it choosed     He should not
object, unless it was implied that if France did not
pay the money, we would go to war    The reso-
| lution before the House declared that the treaty
i should be maintained al all hazaids    There were
I but few things which should be maintained at all
lazaidi     Wnat were they? Was a mere question
of money one    Certainly not     He viewed such
a declaration on our part tantamount to saying,
that we would demand this sum, if lefused, through
war    France would be cowardly indeed if she
should pay the money unde. such c.rcumstances
Mr   COULTER felt much gratified that the
eentleman from New York [Mr Cambkeleno]
, fad offered a modification of the first and had con-
sented to waive the third resolution    This step
' wm calculated to conciliate and insure unanimity
rTtacuon! which wassodesrable rn this occasion.
He was opposed to the th.rü resolution because
,    t ^roX  -ture vwth France, and amounted
l to nothm-     If 'he supposition was correct, the
'  :soTatn%hould go Lther  and ™. «ffi£«t
measure should be adopted for putuna the coan-
