probably Chalmers' division. I have heard nothing from Johnson this morning, but, from what General Croxton reports, there is no doubt that Chalmers crossed the Hardin pike, moving toward Brentwood. The country on the left of the Hillsborough pike, toward the enemy's left, is too difficult for cavalry operations. It seems to me if I was on the other flank of the army I might do more to annoy the enemy, unless it is intended that I shall push out as directed last night.

Very respectfully,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded to Major-General Thomas.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, In the Field, December 16, 1864-11.15 a. m.

General WILSON, Commanding Cavalry:

I am directed by the major-general commanding to inform you of the receipt of your two dispatches of this a. m., which he wil forward to Major-General Thomas. He desires to know if the enemy reported moving are on the Granny White pike, and, if so, at what point; and he thinks, until you receive other orders from General Thomas, you had better hold your forces in readiness to support the troops here, in case the enemy make a heavy attack.

Very respectfully,WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

HDQRS. COUCH'S DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD CORPS, December 16, 1864-12.10 a. m.

CHIEF OF STAFF OF GENERAL SCHOFIELD:

COLONEL: For the information of the general I beg to state that the rebels are very busy fortifying to my right and that of General Cox's. I am fortifying my position.

Respectfully,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS, December 16, 1864-12 m.

Major WHERRY, Chief of Staff:

The country in direction of Granny White pike is so covered by hills and woods as to prevent me from making the observations as directed. The rebels have a line of works commencing at the apex of the hill next to the one I took yesterday, running down to the cross-road--cross-road running east and west--and all along that road for at least two miles easterly. I might take the above hill in front, but am not certain as to my ability to hold it.

Respectfully,D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
