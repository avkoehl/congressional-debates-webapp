The Senate then proceeded to the consideration
of the general order, being the bill to make appro-
priations for the erection of fortifications and the
prevention and sappresssion of Indian hostili'iet,
the motion pending being the amending of Mr
Porter "tor defensive works and barracks, and
purchase of a ate at or near Detroit, Michigan,
#50,000. 
Mr. PORTER urged at considerable length the
propriety and necessity of this appropmtwn,
though he said he could not feel any confidence
that this amendment would pass, as, from tie re-
marks of the chairman of the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs yesterday, it was evident that he and
the committee were opposed to it.
Mr. PRESTON said the amendment stood on
the same footing that it did yesterday, it had not
received the sanction of the committee, nor been
recommended by the Department, and he hoped it
would not ba adopted.
Mr WOODBRIGE could see no good reason m
that objection to the amendment It the measure
was right and proper in itself, he supposed the Se-
nate were competent to decide upon the propriety
of introducing it into the bill But it was said that
all such propositions should receive ¡he sanction rf
the War Department before they are presented for
the action of ihis body. Was that so? Was the
Senate not competent io legislate upon matters pr -
sented for its consideration without the aid ot ihe
Heads of Dtpartments pi d was it the duty ot ihe
Senate merely to register the edie's ot the Execu-
tive? If that was the character oí the body, it wí.s
one which had heretofore escaped his attention
But even supposing the recommenda'ion of the
Department was a necessary prerequisite to the
action of the Sena e, the proposition ot hi1  col-
league could adduce that in us favor Many years
since its importance had attracted the notice < t the
Department, and strong and repeats d reeomnn ndg-
tions. in its favor had been communicated to Con
gress Mr W referred to the. extent of rom mi r
cial intercourse, and the great amount of tonnage
connected with the navganon oí ihe Northwestern
lakes-, wh ch would all be within the grasp of ihe
enemy, if war with Great Bu an snould tale
place to-morrow During ihe las' year the a rivals
and departures at the port of Buffalo were at tue
rate of seventy-five ves elsevery fortnight These <tll
had to pass through the narrow channel of the
Detroit river, (for the protection of wrich this
work was asked,) on ttuir way io the uppir lakes
The exports of Cleveland during lie U- year in
the single article of wlie it amounted to six nilhons
of bushels This was, an ínteres worthy of pro-
tection, and alón? this f.i n ler ihe i uteri ir of our
country was to b° pro ected ¡rom invasion and pil
lage. The city ot D troi', with between sevm
and eipht million  of dolíais' worth of taxab'e pío
perty ard ten thousand inhabitants, was liable at
any moment to be batte ed down by B i ish cannon
from the Canadian side of the strait, and at any
time during the last twelve months a ¡orce of fifteen
or twenty thousand British troops eould be poured
upon it at a few days' no ice
Mr W referred to ihe melarieholv and disas-
trous >-e ults which auen ird the capture of Detroit
by the Br tisb dtir ng the last war. The adjacent
country was ravaged and devastated by the ene-
my—the buildings and enclosures destroyed, the
cattle slaughtered or driven off, and the whole
territory was one extended grave of de olauon
The lamnhmg inhabitant* had to depend upon the
Commanding General for ihe means to sus am
life, and for weeks fiftern hundred rations were
daily issued for this purpose    He himself knew
of a whole family who were compelled to subsist,
during an enure winter, on salted gram and grass,
tosa<e them«elves from starvation He alluded
to the terrible tragedy of the Rvsin, wnere the held
of carnage was drenched with the best blood of
Kentucky, and when, to protect their dead bodies
from being mangled by the wolves, those engaged
in their «epulture had to perform their sad duties
in the darknes  of night for ihe protection of
their ovn scalps. Mr W also referred to the
great waste of life and treasure consequent on the
attempts to recover Detroit, the latter amounting
to at least eighteen or twenty millions of dollars,
and asked was it prudent to incur the risk of a re
peti'ion of this vastexpeiduure by refusing to &;rant
the necessary appropriations for the defence of that
frontier'
Mr BATES expressed his wilhnzness to go for
this amendment, as presenting peculiar claims io
the attention of Congress, but if it was to be fo -
lowed by others, he should vote against them all
so as to leave the bill in tae shap" repor'ed ty the
committee
Mr SEVIER was glad that this amendment had
been proposed by the Senator from Michigan (Mr
Porter,] and any one who had listened to the re-
marks of the Senator nearest h m [Mr Wood
bridse] would find it difficult to make up his mind
to vote against it He hoped the Senate r from
Michigan, and from tine Western States generally,
would meet this question as it should be met, ard
if the Secetary of War intended to leave the inland
frontier from the Sabine to the lakes entire-
ly undefended, they wouid lake the re
sponsibility of voting aga list appropria-
tion* for difences in any o'her pUoe He went
at much length imo the necessity for delenctsa'
the West, and the obligations that rested on this
Government to protect tbe inhabitants of the fron
tier from the nurnerou-t tribe , of savages that their
polioy had placed there Twenty three Inbes of
Indians had been located on tht frontiers of Arkan-
sas and Mi's an, ino) of them in ooposition to
their wishes ind «i h sentimenls of d adlyinimly
to toe win es Tney could muatei forty-three
th msand waimrs, with arms n Iheir ''ands,
which weie furnished by this Government,
and eould be piecipitated ¡it any moment
upon the defenceless frontier Of all these irn e>,
but two, the Choctaws and Chickasaas, could be
depended upon as fnendly to the whites Was
there not, then, a binding ob if,ttion upon &i> Go-
vernment to ¡ntect the people of thia fnnter
from ihe aggressions of these Ind ans, wnieh were
place 1 there by youi laws? If it was not intended
entirely toabandon ¡h'S frontier, appropnat onswere
loudly ca'led for, as there were m t even barra"ks to
shelter the troops What could besaid of the del nee-
less condition of the West, mi°htalso be said of the
Michigan am' Lake fiontier ail he hoped, m this
maite', that the West weuld go ¡n solid ph .lanx,
and resolve to have i common si are of the ap
propnations ici th defence of ¡he count y. If
ibis bill was pas ed, we would bear no more of
Western defences, until a war was upon us, and
he hoped th'H their defencs uould -it-ind or fa 1
with those of other sections o   ihe country.
Mr PRESTON hop^d no such coalition would
be formed. The zeal with which Senators had
advocated the interests of their peculiar sec'ions
wa h ghly creditable fo them, a id deserved the
grautude of their tin ituents, but, having done
all that was ineumbtnt on them to further iho«e
interest* be trusted that they wojld act ¿t, Amen
can Senator , legislating for the whole Union In
rfg->rd to thete fortifications on the frontier, he
would malf one general remark There was a
peculiarity inVegard to cur rela ions witn ag eat
maritime pnjer, which renrer d it de liable that
such of ojr fortific?lions on the maritime fron-
tier as could, is th a trifling expense be plac d in
an efficient of slate defease, should be placed m
that condition This necessity did rot exi t with
regard to the South veslern fr wider, though he ad
mitted tha' it did to a consul rab'e extent in rela
tion to the r'etences of the Canada frontier He
was futly aware of ihe merits of the proposition of
ihe Senator Irom Michigan [Mr Pouter] and
thought if it had been submitted to the Depart-
ment, it would have lecomraended i , but not
having been submitted to the Department, and re-
commended by it, was sufficient for him to oppose
it, and was >n his opinion, a conclusive rea-
son for not inserting it in the bill. With
regard to our inland frontier there was
also a certain degree of threat which was
not be disregarded, but there must be a compro-
mise in such ma'ters, portions of the country must
be postponed for others, all the works could not
proceed pan passu He hoped gendemen would
yield the p int, and not suffer the bill to be defeat-
ed 0/ the weight of amendment-! that were pressed
upon it Let tbe matter sleep until the next regu-
lar session, when the general subject of defence
might be taken up
Mr PORTER read from documents to show that
it hnd received the sanction of the Department,
and h= wished it understood that he placed the
amendment there under its affirmative recommen
dation It stood precisely where the amendment
of the Senator from Mame did, which had passed
yesterday Mr P then went on to point out the
importance to the Government of military works
at Detroit It was entirely undefended, and
might be batt red down, without resistance,
from the opposite side of the river, which, through-
out its whole extent of thirty-1 .vo miles on the Ca-
ñad an ude, was arrayed in a glittering panoply of
sleel
Mr. WOODBRIDGE still further pdvocated the
amendment, and referred to a body of Indians lo-
cated at me rutlet of Lake St Clair, to the amount
of a thousand warriors, who, at the raising of a
finger by the Brit sh Government, would be let
loose upon our defenceless frontier The Senator
fiom South Carolina had alluded to the danger of
d faculties with a maritime power, the plain English
of which, he supposed, was that tnere was danger of
a warwit'i Great Bn'a n. It was a comfort to
him (Mr. W ) that he did not apprehend this dan-
ger to e so imminent But the Senator talked of
raantime defence* "\ow he wou J inform the
Senitor tbat, if he would visit their region of
co intry, they would show him seas where the na-
vies ot emp res mignt proudly display themselves,
and when fieoet, a>. rere agitated by tempests, their
v iv es ran as h gh as were ever witnt-ssed on the
Aliante We will show the Senator waves that
we e threatening enough to drive the scplical
opiiin ns from the bram of the inf del VJney It
was related to him by a gentleman who hid the
command of a schooner engaged m tie navigation
of the likes, lhat in 1797, the celebrated Volney,
who h d been making a tour in the Canadian pro-
vinces, was one if his passenge * A tremendous
s orm arose, anr" toe captain, after making every
exertion to resist its violence, ee^ame convinced of
he ¡runiescr.ess of his effort/, and intimated his be-
lief to ll>° passengers that there was no hope of
either pres ív ng fe vessel or tht hv s of those on
board in this ixtremuy, Volney, who«e inndel
writings were then di seminaling the s^eds of un
belief throughout t^e civ 1 zed wo Id, prostrated
himse'f on the deck, and, wuh much fervor, be-
sought the Being, whose existence re ha.1 denied,
for dcliveiance from their imminent peril. And,
sir, besiies these attributes ot a maritime frontier,
these inland seas ot two thousand miles m extent
are whitened with the sails of American vessels,
at wbos* mast heads proadly fl tat tbe stars and
stupes of our national flag Had ihe Senator
< ver heard of those naval engagements, m which
fleet had encountered fleet, and the gallant Mac-
douough and Perry had lmimrtabzed their names?
Had 1 e ever heard tl,o*e glorious words which rung
fro n one t nd of the country to the other, thrilling
with gladness the heart of eiery American—"we
haie mei the enemy and they ate ours?" But the
Senator opposed this appropriation because it was
r ot for an o'd work Wh> there has been a forti-
I fication at Ditrou for upvards of two hundred
je rs He hoped ihe Senator would see the
) ground'e«s nature of his objections, and the ur-
| suncy for this appropriation, and withdraw his ob-
jections t  it
Mr HUNTINGTON could not support the
amendment His objection was, that the bill be-
fore them was for forts in a state of forwardness,
