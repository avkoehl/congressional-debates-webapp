Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Second Corps:

If Mott is on your left the dispatch of General Grant will refer to him. You must take care of your left. If the enemy comes out to attack it in force you must look out for it and, if necessary, fall back to your old line.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-6.30 p.m. [Received 7. 05 p.m.]

Major-General WEBB,Chief of Staff:

I have directed General Miles to place his division across the White Oak road, near the point where he reached it yesterday. I have directed General Mott to use De Trobriand's brigade and one-half of McAllister's to hold in single rank as much of the line of yesterday as possible and connect with Miles. This is the only manner in which I can get Miles onto the White Oak road and keep up connection with our line to Hatcher's Run. Yesterday Miles did not reach it while holding the line in any strength.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 1, 1865-6.30 p.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Commanding Second Corps:

You will attack the Crow house work at 4 a.m. to-morrow, at which time an assault will be delivered on the front of the Army, of the James, Sixth and Ninth Corps. If you can, in your judgment, effect a lodgment on any other point you are authorized to attack at the same time you assault the Crow house work, viz, 4 a.m. Should your assault be successful you will throw forward your whole command in the direction of the Boydton plank road, endeavoring to communicate with the troops on your right and looking well to your left.

GEO. G. MEADE,
