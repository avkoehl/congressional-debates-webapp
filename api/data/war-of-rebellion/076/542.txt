COMMANDING OFFICER,

Cartersville:

Has nothing been heard of the cavalry sent out by General McCook! What was the occasion of the wire being interrupted! I have ordered a sufficient force to Allatoona in case of need, but the Etowah bridge is more important than Cartersville, and should you be threatened by superior force, move to the bridge, and all trains into Allatoona.
