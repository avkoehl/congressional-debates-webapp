General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: Inasmuch as the movements and operations of the enemy on the Mississippi River must render it impossible and unnecessary to send any more heavy guns for the present, I am induced to renew my application for additional 10-inch columbiads and 7-inch rifled guns of the Brooke pattern, that can be supplied by the works in Richmond, for the armament of Fort Sumter and the works on Sullivan's and Morris Islands.

I am informed that two Brooke 32-pounders, intended for Vicksburg, are lying on the wharf at Mobile. Could they not be ordered here until required on the Mississippi?

Major-General Hunter has been relieved of the command of the Federal troops in this department by Brigadier-General Gillmore, the officer who conducted the operations that resulted in the reduction of Fort Pulaski. I have the orders of both officers on the occasion of the change.

At present three of the enemy's iron-clads are in the North Edisto and two at Hilton Head, leaving one still in Warsaw Sound.

The troops on Folly and other islands about the mouth of the Stono are under command of Brigadier-General Vogdes, an artillery officer, as you will remember, of the regular service. His command is certainly not less than six regiments. There is about one brigade
