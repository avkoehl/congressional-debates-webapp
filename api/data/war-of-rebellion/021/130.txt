The town was evacuated by the enemy on the 21st. The Essex and No. 7 remain before it. I expect to be in possession this morning.

No. 2. Reports of Major J. De Baun, Ninth Louisiana Battalion Partisan Rangers.

CAMP PRATT, August 21, 1862.

SIR: I have to report that on yesterday morning I drove in the Federal pickets and caused a general stampede for the forces in Baton Rouge, who, with the exception of those in the barracks, fled to the gunboats. They fired upon me with one company and afterward their gunboats shelled me for two hours. It is reported that they killed 1 woman and 5 children and 1 negro woman. This I do not know of my own knowledge. I captured 23 head of cattle from their slaughter-pen; I drove all the horses they had down to Bird's field and 33 down as far as Seth David's-a part of which I now have.

The Federals have released all the convicts from the penitentiary. All the negroes that were in the prelintiary have been uniformed and armed. This information regarding the penitentiary I have received from a convict who is now in my camp.

Respectfully,

J. DE BAUN,

Major, Commanding Partisan Rangers.

Brigadier-General RUGGLES.
