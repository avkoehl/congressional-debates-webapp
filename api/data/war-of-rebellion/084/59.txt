COLONEL: Your dispatch in relation to the Third Division is received. The Second Brigade, Third Division, reported to me pursuant to paragraph 14, of Special Orders, Numbers 167, from headquarters Department of the Gulf. The staff and paraphernalia of the Third Division followed out here, but do not report to me. I understand that they report to headquarters Department of the gulf direct. I have sent a written communication on the subject to headquarters Department of the Gulf through you which will reach you headquarters to-morrow, making suggestion in regard to the matter.

Truly, yours,

R. A. CAMERON,

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. SMITH,

Actg. Asst. Insp. General, Defenses of New Orleans:

COLONEL: On the 20th ultimo I received Special Orders, Numbers 41, from headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi, dated June 18, 1864, ordering me to report for duty without delay to the Second Brigade, Third Division, Nineteenth Army Corps. On the same day, the 20th, I received a telegraph dispatch from headquarters Department of the Gulf ordering me not to leave my post until properly relieved. You may be assured that with as large and as important a command as this, and the fine filed of energy and labor, I have no disposition to leave it at present, unless in the judgment of my superior officers I can be more useful elsewhere; but it appears to me that I should have an order from Major-General Canby, revoking his previous order, for my protection. I wish you would be kind enough to have General Sherman correspond with the major-general commanding the Military Division of West Mississippi in regard to the matter, and thus greatly oblige,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.

Yours, &amp;c.,
