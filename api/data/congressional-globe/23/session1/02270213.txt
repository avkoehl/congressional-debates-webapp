THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

killed by the veto, and a'the time of the President's
term of office was longer than the remaining teim
of the charter, there was no pcssibi'ity that the
bank would obta n a rene val of i s charter It did
not requne memouals f-om Philadelphia, or else-
where, to tell us that the measure was productive
of distress and embarrassment Its necessary re-
sult was general distrust and despondency
Mr G considered the pov er of removal as a
legal, not a constitutional power, and while he was
a representative of the peopie, he meant to watch
over its exercise The only way to preserve lib-
erty was to diffuse powei Where it was concen-
trated , it became corrupt
Virginia stood in opposition to the power as
sunned by Congress to charter any bank, her
doeaines, as to the rights-of the States, were well
known, and by them he was determined to stand
01 fall
The resolutions were then read, after which,
Mr PATTON rose and called for the reading
of the following  letter, which was s nt by the
Govenor of Virginia, with the resolutions, to the
Representatives in Congress from Virginia-
VIRGINIA
Executive Department,
Ftbi uary 1J, 1834
Sir In compliance with the request of the Gen-
eral Assembly of the Commonwealth, it gives roe
great pleasure to transmit to you the accompany-
ing resolutions, adopted by that body, disarjprovmg
of the recent act of the President, in withdrawing
and withholding the public deposites from the bank
where they had been placed by law
This dangerous and alarming assumption of
power has already inflicted deep and lasting injury
uoon the citizens of this Commonwealth, wmch
your efforts and exertions in the Congress of the
United States, it is hoped, will aid in alleviating as
fai as practicable, and restraining the disposition
which the President has manifested to extend his
official authority beyond its just ana proper limits,
which he has so clearly manifested in his recent
interference with the Treasury Department of the
Federal Government
I am, sir, with respectful consideration, your
ebedient servant,                       JOHN FLOYD
Mr P rose to perform the unpleasant and un-
gracious task of snowing that the Governor of Vir-
ginia, in thus sending his missive to therepresent-
ativea of that State in Congiess, had manifested a
disposition to extend his authority beyond its
proper and defined limits And he desired to
know by what right the Executive was authorized
to do more than to transmit the íesolutions But
when he did thus denounce the acts of the President
in withdrawing the deposites, as a dangerous and
alarming assumption ot power, which he felt pleas-
ure m doing, he ought to have given a better and
more accurate description than he had chosen to
do, of the state of public opinion, and have added,
that Virginia had not deser'ed the opinions which
she had always entertained in oppos tion to the
bank—that Virginia still held to the opinions which
she promulgated in 1798, and which she íeiterated
in 1811, that the power io estaohsh such an l-isti
tu'ion by Congress, was a dangeious violation of
the Constitution, and a dangeious encroachment
upon the sovereignty of each of the United Stateb
Ihe Governor had been pleased, also, to express
his hopes that the efforts of the representa'ives of
Virginia here would be used in lesiraimng the dis-
position manifested by thePiesident, in extending
his judie al authority But, whilst he would ac
knowledge with gratitude any opmons witn which
h" might be favored, to instiucthimasto the path
he should pursue, and give such instiuction the
consideration it would merit, he could not recos
ruse the Governor's light to do so, under the offi-
cial gaib of his authonty, addiessed byletteis
missive, more in the style of a groat potentate, to
an ambassador selected by him to do his bidd ng,
than in anything elbe No person had more 'oudly
joined in the umveisal burst of indignation with
which the President's proclamation had been
received, in Vnginia, than the present Governor of
Vngima And he had upon all occasions joined
in denouncing the Piesidentfoi having assumed
what he cons dered to be an authonty which did
rot belong to him, and should, or ooffht, therepie
E-ntatives, the free representatives of Vngima, sub-
mit with complacency to him, in what was as great
an assumption, and look on, or listen with com-
placency to the anathemas he dealt forth at his
pleasure against the President' He felt that it
became them to treat the executive authority, at
all times, with becoming re pect, and when the
Governor proceeded in this style, he was remind-
ed of the anecdote told of the honest Dutchman,
Henry Snyder, who, passingjudgmentupon him
self, was forced to acknowledge, that in taking too
much toll—but which he gave to the poor—" he
might go along vid the sheep, but it was a tammed
tight squeeze " There was but little d ¿Terence be
tween this as&urnDtion by the Governor, and that
I by the President He would regret his missive,
the President's proclamation, and the manifesto
read by the President to his Cabinet, as of one
ard the same class, par nobil' fratium, and all as
being effloiescetice from the soil of Executive
I pruriency
In noticing the resolutions of the Legislate e,
he would do m> with all the respect to which they
were entitled His own opinions on the subject
matter were well known to be at variance with
them he had given the subject every considera-
tion, and he saw no reason to change the opinion
he had entertained Although he might best con-
sult his own interest by do,ng so, and joining m
the cry that was endeavored to be raised of tyr
anny and despotism, he would not until he was
directed so to do by that authority which only he
could recognise—that of the people whom he
represented He would not float into the stream,
which must finally lead to the gulf of despo ic
consolidation, into which the country was rapid'y
falling He remembered well, and the tine was
not long gone by, when Virginia stood alone in
resisting the encioachments of the I ederal Gov
ernment The doctrine, however, spread The
Bank of the United States was one of the. first
bern that sprung from these encioachments He
therefore íejoiced that, as it was the most power
ful, it was then reelng and totteung under the
same blow which had nearly destroyed the two
others, which had a similai origin—internal im-
provement and the tariff He could not wish to
mitigate its fate, and hoped that those who con
tended so successfully in arresting the progress of
consolidation, would not be led way under the
influence of excitement, and thus abandon their
prmcip'es Mr P leferred to the opinions ex
pressed by Mr Madison, in his various letters
under the signature of Pubhus, showing the dan
gers of concentiatmg power, and argued at length
to piove, that if the preambleto theiesolution was
adopted, as there was in it what he contended was
an unfounded assumption of power, the natural
conclusion must be that it must result in erecting
a principle which isalike unsound In commenting
upon the resolutions adopted by the Legislature
of his State, he was compelled to deny that the
fiamers of the Constitution deemed the act of the
Presidentm removing from of ice to be a dangerous
or alaimmg usurpation He maintained that the
powei of i°moval was more properly an exeru
tive than a legislative power
Mr P said that no one contended that the Pr*s
ident had the right to use capriciously the power
of removal and appointment    Such a right would
set up all the ofFces of the country to be scram
bled foi, and  establish the detestable punciple
that the spoils of the vanquished belong to the
victors   He would oppose tins principle by whom
soever it might be advanced     Mr P  here read a
passage ftom the speech of Mr  Calholn, stating
that the powei of removal could be constitution
ally exercised, and viewing its exeicise, m the |
present case, asan abuse, and not asan assumption
of power     Tnis gentleman íested his opposition to
the measure on the supposed impropriety of the
motives of the President in exercising the power
If he could believe that the President's motives '
, were corrupt, he would go as fii as any one in ^
' condemning them, and he would be willing that .
any inquii V shou'd be instituted irto the facts       |
But the question did not rest upon reason or
argument     There was the highest authority for
the right of the President to exeic se the power
It íested on a legiblative act, passed in 1789, nine ,
days after the organi75tion of the depaitment, !
establishing the salaiies of the executive depart  |
ments    But the question was put %rever at ie¡>t
by the fact that the act creating the Treasury Des
partmeru imposed upon the Secretary of the Treas-
ury to report to Congress plans for the improve-
ment of the revenue, &c , and that Congress is not
bound to act upon those plans, but may lay them
aside He censured Mr Duane, not for refusing
to lesign, but for giving a pledge to resign He
maintained that the President had acted honestly
and faithfully in this matter, and that he had the
constitutional right to remove Mr Duane, and that
he would have been recreant to his trust if he had
not removed him
If the correctness of the Piesident's motives
| were questioned, let them be inquired into and
l ascertained
But it was said that the House of Representa-
tives had declared that the deposites were safe in
the Bank of the United States To this he an-
swered that the opinion was forced upon Congress
by the application of the gag, without considera
tion or the examination or evidence There was
nothing in the vote of Congress, or that resolu-
tion, which ought, m the least degree, to have in-
fluenced the action of the Pi esident on this subject
But it was said that the House of Representatives
had the exclusive control of the Treasury There
was not a clause in the Constitution which gave
countenance to this assertion The bills were to
originate in the House of Representatives This
had no reference to the present question All laws
respecting the keeping of the deposites belong to
the legislative de|>artment, in the constitutional
use of the term, and are not the peculiar province
of the House of Representatives But Genera,
Jackson had not seized the purse He could not
touch even a dollar of his own salary withoutthe
forms of law K was said that he could turn out
the officers, and put in those creatures who would
s gn such warrants as weie presented to them
But it was as vain to talk about that as to say that
the legislative department might take the whole
suiplus revenue and distribute itamong ourselves,
as extia compensation We had the power to do
it but should that prevent us from exercising our
just and proper powers' It was idle to argue
agamst the existence of powers from their possi-
bility of being abused It was the part of" wis-
dom to restrain the powers of Government within
just limits, and, by propel checks, to prevent those
limits from being transcended If gentlemen think
that this is an arbitrary assumption of power by
the President, he submitted that they ought to
proceed to inquire into the facts Let us not act
as accusers and j udges If the charges were true,
the President ought to be impeached, and if they
were true, he ought to be convicted Accoiding
to his present impression, he could no* see thedis-
Unctton between this question and that of rechar-
tenng the bank Un e: s he could be convinced
that the lesturation of the deposites would relieve
the community, he should vote against their res-
toration
He could not agree with the Legislature that the
«safety of the public treasure was the only reason
foi which the deposites could be ■•emoved On the
contrary, he did not think it a leading considera-
tion If thatwereintendedbythecharter,it would
have been so stated Why should the charter
require the Secretaiy of the Tieasury to give
"ieasons,"vvhen they contemplated but one reason'
The charter also rcquued that the notes of the
bank should be rece ved in payment of the rev-
enue, and if, m giving this power to remove the
deposites, their safety was alone considered, wou'd
not some provision have been made for discred-
iting their notes at the Treasury at the sane time
that the deposites were removed ' It was not his
design to advert at piesent to many other points
which had been bioughunto discussion, but which
were not presented by the resolutions of the Legis-
lature He, however, íesisted the idea that the
United States Bank was the Treasuiy, and con-
tended that the Treasury was the public monev,
whe-ever it was kept If the bank had violated
its cnarter, and engaged in party contests, the
Secretary had tne right to remove the deposites
One of the changes against the bank had been
attempted to be met by ridicule But the charge
«as too serious to be got over in tnat way He
t ítn went into a detail of the printing expenses ot
the bank dunng the late contest for the Piesi-
dency, at the veiy moment when the mam ques-
