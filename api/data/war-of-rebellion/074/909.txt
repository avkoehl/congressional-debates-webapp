Report of Brigadier General William H. Young, C. S. Army, commanding Ector's brigade, of operations July 17-September 4.
HEADQUARTERS ECTOR'S BRIGADE,Lovejoy's Station, September 17, 1864.

MAJOR: In compliance with circular orders from corps headquarters of the 16th instant, I have the honor to submit the following report of the action this brigade since General Hood took command of the army, about July 17 [18]:

That event found the brigade occupying the works previously constructed on the south bank of the Chattahoochee River, on both sides of the railroad, with skirmishers along the river-bank extending from a point half a mile below the bridge up and several hundred yards above the month of Peach Tree Creek. Here the brigade remained, having considerable skirmishing with the enemy across the creek, and exposed at times to pretty to severe artillery fire from the enemy's batteries, both together causing some loss to the brigade, until the night of the 19th of July, when it was relieved by the brigade of General Sears, commanded by Colonel Barry. On the same night the brigade took position in the line of intrenchments near Peach Tree Creek, its center resting upon the Marietta road, the brigade forming the extreme left of the line, its front covered, as usual, by skirmishers.

About 12 m. on the brigade was ordered to move to the right along the main works, the skirmishers along the rifle-pits. When the brigade had moved to the right within about half a mile of the road leading from Pace's Ferry to Atlanta, it crossed the works and moved forward until it arrived at the line of rifle-pits. Here, while halted, the skirmishers came in contact with it, were rallied, and their proper positions in the brigade, which was soon of Cockrell's brigade.

During the night the two brigades were withdrawn, and on the 21st we took position in the trenches, with the right resting about a quarter of mile west of the Pace's Ferry road. About 4 p. m . of
