PURCELLVILLE, December 1, 1864.

[Brigadier General W. MERRITT:]

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that in pursuance of instructions we followed the prescribed route, destroying thoroughly the country as far north as the Potomac. We joined General Devin last night (after a march of thirty-two miles) at 8 o'clock, at Lovettsville, bringing with us about 900 head of cattle and 150 horses. The job is done well, but the latter part of the order directing ut to Philomont is modified by General Devin, who will go on the Leesburg pike to join you this a. m. We have about 1,500 cattle and very slow driving, as they are very tired.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDW. MYERS,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
