HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Fort Leavenworth, February 11, 1865.

Brigadier-General Mitchell, Omaha:

All troops going into your district are ordered to report to you by telegraph from Fort Kearny, and to push on to Julesburg, unless they get orders there; and the operations in your district are under your charge. You had better stay at Omaha until we get matters under way, to attend to affairs there. When we get troops out there you can join them if necessary. I keep in direct communication with Colonel Livingston, so as to avoid delay and get posted. Have ordered him to report all news to me at the same time he does to you.

G. M. DODGE,

Major- General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Fort Leavenworth, February 11, 1865.

Brigadier- General MITCHELL, Omaha:

You need not send any rations from Omaha. I will send al rations needed from here. Send only corn from Omaha, and that should be pushed up the valley. Have your quartermaster report to colonel Potter daily what he is doing.

Where is Mud Springs! Where are Colonel Collins' troops stationed! Have any troops come down from North Platte route to the South Platte route! Say to Colonel Collins our posts must be held. As fast as troops can march they will go to your aid, and I will get aid from Denver as soon as I can reach that place.

Colonel LIVINGSTON,

Fort Rankin:

Send following dispatch through to Colonel Moonlight, at Denver, immediately:

Colonel MOONLIGHT,

Commanding District of Colorado:

The Department of Kansas has been attached to my command. You will immediately throw your available force on the road from Denver to Julesburg. If you have not men enough, take militia to hold the route until I can relieve them with troops on the way. Co- operate with Colonel Livingston. Repair telegraph; open communication and hold it open. Plenty of troops are on the road to chastise the Indians, but Denver must hold its part of the line. Let me hear from you.

Major- General.
