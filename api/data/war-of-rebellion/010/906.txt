Friday morning our gunboats made attack on enemy's gunboats at Memphis. They had eight, including rams. All destroyed or captured but one, the Van Dorn, in one hour. Our ram fleet did good service. Enemy's loss about 100 killed and 4 taken prisoners. None hurt on our side but Colonel Ellet, of ram fleet, slightly. Flag-Officer Davis demanded surrender of city. Mayor complied. Our flag placed upon the post-office, and all rebel flags in city and cotton yards taken down by Colonel Fitch with detachments from Forty-third and Forty-seventh Indiana. Five thousand persons on bluff looking on battle; Jeff. Thompson among them, mounted, soon disappeared. Montgomery ran his boat ashore and escaped to the woods with his crew. The gunboat Van Dorn was the only one escaped. Troops had all left Memphis Thursday. People acquiesced in new order of things. Everything quiet when steamer left.
