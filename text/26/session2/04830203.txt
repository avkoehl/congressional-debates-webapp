title, and jurisdiction over the terru rv withm their
limits, as appertain to every independent Govern-
ment on eanh This was what the Constitution
contemplated, when the power to admit new States
was given to Congress The Northwest territory
was the territory provided for It was to be dis
posed of by Congress for the support of the Go
vernment. It was to be sold to citizens, who «ere
te organize themselves under its autnonty into de-
pendent Governments As was the practice in the
beginning, it was contemplated that millions of
acres would be disposed of to companies, and that
in this way, the great body of the soil would be
disposed of, before the Territory would be ready
to become a State To obtain a fair considera-
tion for the remainder, wnenever the Territory be
came strong enough to claim her right to indep n
dence, and her right to admission into the Union,
as the co equal of the States, the Congiess should
have in every instance disposed of such remainder
of the territorial domain to the State about to be
admitted, upon such equitable and reasonable terms
as such State could have in gocd faith complied
with The framers of the Constitution never con-
templated that this Government would become a
landjobber or speculator. It was to be sold for a
moderate sum to communities who could settle it
The great object was to add strength to the nation,
by adding young, vigorous, and flourishing States
to the Union. That these States were to have the
right to exercise exclusive legislation over the soil
within their limits, i5 proved by that provision of
the Constitution, which grants to Congress "ex
elusive legislation over this District, ard over such
places wiihm the limits of the States, as are ne-
cessary for the erection of forts, magazines, arse-
nals, dock yards, and other neediul buildings '
The same soil cannot be subject to the legislation
of two separate and distinct sovereignties Tnere
fore the Constitution found it necessary to obtain
from the States the right of jurisdicnon over so
much of the soil within their limits, as wa>
necessary for the occuparc) of ihc military of
the United States, and ioi the use of the Federal
Governm nt Without this provision m the Con
stitution, Congress could not constitutionally exer-
ci>e legislation over a foot of land within the limits
of any State of this Union Tne Constitution fur-
ther says that "Congress shall have power to dis
pose of, and make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory and other property belonging
to the United States" Respecting the ttrt itory be-
longing to the Un ted States' The moment, then,
that a territory becomes a five and independent
State, the right of the United States to d spose < f,
and make all need ul rules and regulations respec -
ing such territory so belonging to the United fetates,
must necessarily cea«e and determine That sec-
tion clearly applies to a terruoiy belonging to the
United States The moment, therefore, ihat such a
territory become a State, it no longer belongs to the
United States, and the right to dispose of it, an J to
legislate over it, must necessarily be suirendeied
It must, therefore, be admitted, that the legislation
of Congress over the soil within the limits of either
of the States of tms Umop, is a violation of the
Constitution, if the views submitted are correct
It becomes the duty of Congress to look seriously
intoihis matter, and to see if they werenotevery day
of their lives violating the Constitution, when they
were constantly passing laws in relation to the soil
within the limits of sovereign and mdepenlent
States. If these \iews are correct, it would seem
to be the bounden duty of Congress immediately to
di pose of, to the new State. , ■ill the public lands
withm the limits of eicb, and to settle forever this
odious and cruel conflict, so injurious to the new
States, and so unworthy of such a Government as
that of the United S ates To be a sovereign State,
and not a dependency, the Siate must posses ex-
clusive jurisdiction over the soil within hei limits,
she mu¡t have power to tax ihe soil f >i the support
of her government, or she is dependent But the
Síate^as they became strongenoush to ask admiss on
into the Union, vere fsreed to surrender this indis
pensable attribute ot sovereignty They have bound
themselves not to interfere with the sale by Con-
gress of the public lands within their limits, nor to
tax them, so long as they remain unsold, and, in
some of the States, not for five years after they are
sold These terms are directly contrary to the
spirit and intention of the Federal Constitution,
they are ippressive and unjust, they have materi-
ally retarded the growth of the new States, but some
of them have grown astonishingly, notwithstanding
they have had to contend with «uch great and
almost insurmountable obstacles, and yet, th° new
States have complied in good faith with the«e op
pressive compacts, which they were forced to sub-
mit to, or else be compelled to remain in a state of
colonial dependency for an indefinite number of
years The new Stales have strictly complied
with their conn acts, notwithstanding the odious
condition m which it places them They permit
tneir own citizens to become officers of thi Go-
vernment, who fell the public lands without mo
testation or difficulty—they receive your money,
and pay it into the National Treasury Their cm
z-ms are constantly driven to apply to Congress to
pass laws for their relief, and, they and their re
presentatives are placed in tne ho reble attitude of
suppliants for your justice and hbeialny at each
succeeding session of Congress Is it not mockery
I to call the new States wdenendent, so loi°- as they
are held in such a state ot vassalage? But, it is
now proposed to pl?c« them at the mercy < f sone
twenty masters Maiie it ihe interest of the old
States to raise the puce of the public lands, and
you step at once all liberal action on the part of
Congress towards the settlers in the new States
\ ou create a desire on the part of the States to get
all the monsy they can out of (he citizens of the
new State*—yon whet the r appetites for gold, pto-
cured from others without labor or exertion This
appetite for gold will increase with e/ery contnbu
tion, and at Hit, H will not be satisfied but with
the litf's blood of the citizens, of the new State
He regarded the distribution of the proceeds of the
public lands as a violation of the compacts into
wl ícli the new Stales ha\ e been forced to en ei, and
he anticipated thet the new States, n justice to
tt emselves, would be compelled to claim the right
to all the «oil within their limits, (which such
violation of the compact would make necessary
for their pieservation) if this distribution measure
is ever adopied, and which their recognu on by thu
United State  as s veieign States would have given
them, had they not b°en foiced to entei into such
compacts
The effet of such a measure, upon tn<* Stue lie
had the honor in par! to repre ent wou'd be tem-
blé ndeed Her people \ ould be drained cf eveiy
dcll\r, to go into the treasuries of olnei States—no
sir, to go into the pockets of foreign tankers, who
would realize it, as dear profits, from the enhance-
ment of the value of State stocks, which must m-
fvitably result from ¡he passing of su'ha'aw or,
perhaps, her citizens would be driven off, t > get rid
of the oppressions and burdens which they would
not be able to bi?ar Arkansas was organized as a
Terntory before any of her lands were sold Sup-
ple Congress hal refund to dispose o any of the
lands at a fair price, and Iit citizens had remained
in that situation until sie vas a anted into
the Union as a State Suppose then, that specula-
tor  had come mio the State, and hid pur-
chased the homes of all her citizens, an t had at-
tempted to drive them, with their wives iid chil-
dren, from their dwellings—could the^ have suc-
ceeded in such an attempt* Would not the State
have protected her citizen ' Cou'd this Govern-
ment have enforced such an attempt -u dispos es
sion1 If the State of Arkan "s could thus be pre
vented from taxing her hnds for her support—f
she could not protect her citizen", -¡gainst such ca-
lamities, would she be a soveieign SlPte^ Would
she be placd upon an equal foinng wnh the other
S ates of this Un on' Would i not be ídl* to call
ner independent? If you distr bute the proceeds of
the sales of the publ c lands among he States, the
only effect it wnl have w 11 be to raise the value of
State bonds You will deprive this Gov rnm<>n'of
five mllions annually of re«- mic, and jru force
her to lay that amount of duties upon our impor a-
ticns of articles which the people are compelled to
purchase, and for which they will have to pav five
millions of dollars more than they now pay, to
make up for the deficiency, and the result of the
whole operation will be, not to give relief any
where, but to enab e the present holders of State
stociis to realize at least five millions of dollars of
prtfits per annum upon their investments. Sup-
pose that Congress, under the power to dispose of
the territory, should attempt to give the lands them-
selves, m ihe new States, instead of the proceeds of
the sales of those lands, to the old States, (and this
would be a much nearer compliance with the un-
limited power claimed for Congress, under the
word "dispose," than that which is contended for,)
would the new States submit to such a donation of
the soil within their limits'! If the lands in Arkan-
sas were given to any S'ate m this Union, such
State or States would never be ab e to exercise any
right of ownership over the lands so granted She
would resist the c'aim of such masters, and she
would be driven to exercise the rights of a sove-
reign State ever all the unappropriated lands with-
in her limits,
To settle forever all these difficulties, and to re-
move all grounds ot conflict, between those States,
who ought to b°, n all respects, equal, to place it
in the power of the new States to derive a ffeir
revenue from the soil over which they ought to be
able to exercise complete jurisdiction, to place it m
the power of their cit zens to add to the wealth of
their Slates, by tl eir labor and enterprise, instead
of thereby adding, as they now do, to the wealth of
the United States, by enhancing the value ot the
public lands, to res ore harmony and tranquillity
to the Union, Ipssen the expenses and legislation of
Congress, and forever to remove a great engine ca-
pable of influencing most dangerously almost all
our elections, the unendmeni now under considera-
tion pioposes to cede to the new States, upon terms
the moit equitable for th s Government, all the lands
within the limits of eich State The amendment
provu'es t^nt the States shall pay over to the United
States 65 per c nt of the proceeds of the sales of
the public lands This is nearly equal to what is
realued by this Goverriment by the existing sys-
tem It costs this Governmtnt 22 per cent of the
proceeds of the «ales to carry on the present sys-
tem To this add the five per cent granted to the
new States for internal improvements, and the va-
iious evpenses which cannot be enutnerated, and
we have marly 35 per cent the amount proposed
to be allowed to the new States for expenses and
a'l other rrsponsibilties It was said by the Sena-
tor from Kentuouy [Mr Clay] that the expenses to
the States f r selling the pubhc lands would not ex-
ceed two per cent It is impossible to say what
those exnenses would be Bat that is not the que*-
t on T i> calculation ou?ht t~> be founded upon
the cost of the systi m to the United States Ought
not tins Government to be willing to give up to
the States the amount which Ihe present system
coUs, in order to obiain a fair settlement of
this vexatious quest on* But it is contended
that the rew States conn' nrt be relied upon
lo pay o/tr futnfull, to the Unrfd Stages the 65
p'rcoit which they had co irtclcd to pay It is
s-nd th t the i^w S ates wo ll' be unfaithful, and
tjul' not le ri.1 cd upon This is s<ud, too, by Se-
nators " ho v ave always complained at the slightest
imputation on State credit But lo prove the m-
ja tice of the assertion, just look at the conduct of
he new States under the present system They
have surrendered rights to which they were clearly
entitled, as free and independent States. Bather
ihan remain m a state ot territorial dependency,
tbey surrendered what the Constitution guaranties
to evei/ soveieign Siate, and they have hitherto
alwavs ac'ed m good faith, and in all respect*com-
pl ed with t ie compacts entered into They have
never mteifered with the primary disposal of the
pub'ie Urds, nor have they attempted to tax it, or
to exern e any ownership over it They have
groa-ed under oppression, and yt they have not
'evoltPd How then can it be supposed that they
will no act equally in good faith, i  pa\mg ovtr
the 65 per cent of the ¡,iOc<"Kis of the sales of the
oub e land'1 Their fa lure to do so would be an
annulment ot the contract, they would there-
fore have every inducement to comply most
strictly Bat even if it were admitted that
the States could not be entirely relied upon
was there not a proposition which ought to obviate
