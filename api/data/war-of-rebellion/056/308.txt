HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 2, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel J. J. PHILLIPS,

Commanding Ninth Illinois Infantry, Athens, Ala.:

I am in receipt of your of movements to Florence, &amp;c.; all very satisfactory. You can go to Huntsville if you desire. Wheeler has his hands full looking after Grant's cavalry and taking care of Bragg's rear. I sent 400 mounted infantry to Florence, and thence down the river, two or three days ago, to drive out anything that might be between here and Eastport. General Crook's cavalry should take care of all or most all the part east of you, as you have enough to watch to the south and west. I shall try to send you more force as soon as possible. The telegraph should soon be up to Athens. Have the man whom you recommended so highly commence recruiting negroes as fast as possible. I left the order blank for you to insert his name. As soon as he gets a company send him up with them.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
